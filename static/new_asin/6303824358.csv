718296,5,6303824358,"This is one of the two versions of A Christmas Carol that we watch every holiday season (the 1951 Alistair Sim version is the other). George C.

718400,5,6303824358,"I love this version of the  A Christmas Carol. George C. Scott is a great in this movie as all the actors. It doesn't feel like Christmas unless I watch this movie.
The Blu-ray disc is sharp and brings the film to its best visually.",1519084800,,232,4.155555555555556

718408,5,6303824358,"The story of Scrooge is a classic and timeless work!  Production and setting show a different era-one in which the uncertainty of life was a daily reality. Without the modern day trappings of advanced medical treatments, the story leads one to naturally consider the eternal possibilities that there is life after death, that God is real, and that one's character choices on earth may influence how and where we live eternally if all this is true.  Reflection upon what meaning our life may have in light of the choices we make daily about how we treat our fellow man and use our resources can be particularly enlightening during the holiday season where commercialism and competing priorities can cloud our vision.",1518220800,,715,4.95

718488,5,6303824358,"We try to watch every version of this ""A Christmas Carol"" out there, And this one is one of the best with George C Scott.  So this year I added several versions I found  available on Amazon.. Does not disappoint~",1518048000,,212,4.275
718489,5,6303824358,George C. Scott always superior in his presentations.  This version of A Christmas Carol is one of the best productions.  Home library has as many as have been shown on TV and the screen.  Now waiting for THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS.  Every December all are revisited for a month long celebration of this great classic.  P.S.  The early production with Simms is the most authentic.,1517961600,,384,4.742424242424242

718492,5,6303824358,"This was always my favorite version while growing up for some reason.  I hadn't seen it in years when I stumbled across it on Amazon.  Yep, still enjoy this version and would still rank it as my personal favorite.",1517702400,,213,4.435897435897436
718493,1,6303824358,"Maybe Im a boorish clod, but I found this DVD preachy, too long and boring.  I got the impression that the dialog in the movie was holding very close to Dickens original novel, which made it overly literary in the 19th Century style, and hence stilted in places
 (Actually, I bought it late and night and I was sleepy at the time.  I thought I was ordering a second copy of the ballet version by the Northern Ballet; which got the message through more effectively, was half as long and twice as entertaining.)",1517529600,,509,4.451612903225806
718494,5,6303824358,If you don't know this is one of the classics. I was a kid in the 80s and this is what we had,1517529600,,93,3.0869565217391304
718495,5,6303824358,Best version of A Christmas Carol I've seen yet! Will remember to watch this every holiday season! Terrific acting to boot!,1517356800,,123,4.904761904761905

718575,3,6303824358,I remember liking this movie as a child and wanted to watch it with my kids.  Unfortunately like a lot of older movies it couldn't hold their attention and I ended up watching it by myself.,1516579200,,189,4.25
718576,5,6303824358,Love this move. We watch it every Christmas.,1516579200,,44,4.625

718639,3,6303824358,Not nearly as good as the Alistair Sims version! Too dark..,1516406400,,59,4.454545454545454
718640,5,6303824358,"Except for Muppets' Christmas Carol which is well, in a league of its own, this is my favorite version of this poignant tale of greed and redemption. I watch it every year and I am always moved and resolved to continue to be a better person to my fellow human beings.",1516320000,,267,4.254901960784314
718641,5,6303824358,I feel that  this is the best Christmas Carol adaptation out there. Of course I love the old school black and white but I don't think there is another version so true to the book. And George C Scott is just outstanding in his portrayal as Ebenezer Scrooge,1516233600,,255,4.3125
718642,5,6303824358,George C Scott IS the best scrooge.,1516233600,,35,4.142857142857143

718644,5,6303824358,My favorite of all the Christmas Carol movies,1516060800,,45,4.75
718645,5,6303824358,I love this telling of A Christmas Carol.  I think each actor was just right for the part.  George C. Scott is perfect as Scrooge. We watch this every year.,1515974400,,156,4.166666666666667
718646,5,6303824358,"This is a very good rendition of a classic that's been done a thousand different ways.  The remix and definition was of very good quality for a movie that was made 34 years ago.  I'm biased because I'm a big George C. Scott fan, but he played a great Scrooge and that voice of his fit the part perfectly.  The Ghost of Christmas Future was a bit cheesy in it's portrayal, but again, the movie was released 34 years ago.  My wife and I enjoyed it very much, worth the purchase.",1515801600,,476,4.197802197802198

718672,5,6303824358,"I have seen several different versions of this story and this is my all time favorite. George C. Scott is the perfect Scrooge. I am so happy to finally have this and know it will always be there to enjoy every Christmas now. I also love Edward Woodward as the ghost of Christmas present, loved him in The Equalizer as well. This is the only version of A Christmas Carol for me.",1515628800,,377,4.25
718673,5,6303824358,"This version of Christmas Carol is best of the best. The story is a valuable classic, the acting superb and put together in a very effective way. My family watches this each Thanksgiving night, ushering in the Christmas season. Its one of our best traditions. It is very effective in motivating us to be better people.",1515542400,,318,4.696428571428571
718674,5,6303824358,I think the best Christmas Carol ever made.  I love this one my husband and I made it a must see at Christmas time. Its the best!,1515542400,,129,3.7777777777777777
718675,5,6303824358,I did not view the movie yet.  But I'm sure it will be fine.,1515456000,,60,3.2857142857142856
718676,5,6303824358,We watch this every Christmas and just had a VHS so we rented this one.,1515456000,,71,3.8
718677,5,6303824358,Classic. The whole family enjoyed this version,1515369600,,46,5.714285714285714
718678,5,6303824358,"A holiday classic both written and acted superbly. George C. Scott is mesmerizing in the lead role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, though there's plenty of great support from all involved. Well worth an annual rental fee.",1515110400,,211,5.057142857142857
718679,5,6303824358,A holiday classic.  We'll be watching it every year.,1515110400,,52,4.777777777777778
718750,5,6303824358,"For my money, the most authentic and well-acted ""A Christmas Carol"" ever filmed. George C. Scott is brilliant, and doesn't allow his ""Scrooge"" to devolve into caricature. His Scrooge is a rational, self-satisfied shell of a man, which makes him more frightening, and makes his comeuppance seem ever so more deserved. A timely and timeless classic, done to perfection!",1514851200,,367,5.237288135593221
718751,5,6303824358,by far the best christmas carol film out there...it shows a personal side to the characters and a very forgiving end result that I loved,1514851200,,136,4.48
718752,2,6303824358,"Not a great job by Scott.
You get the feeling he is putting one
over on the ghosts. Not the most cheerful
person the next day either.",1514764800,,133,3.962962962962963
718753,5,6303824358,George Scott is the best. Only Christmas Carol Ill watch.,1514678400,,57,4.8

718755,5,6303824358,Great movie!!!! Arrived in great condition!,1514592000,,43,6.333333333333333
718756,5,6303824358,A classic Christmas movie that my family watches every year. One of the best!,1514505600,,77,4.571428571428571
718757,3,6303824358,"This my families' favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"". The music is classic. The filming and acting are wonderful! George C. Scott is perfect for the part. If you haven't seen it, get it and make it part of your holiday.",1514246400,,224,4.487804878048781
718758,5,6303824358,"The 1951 version is a classic, but this version is a masterpiece (even though it was made for T.V.) I enjoy both at this time of year. So since it is 12/25/2017 MERRY CHRISTMAS everybody!",1514160000,2,187,4.371428571428571
718759,5,6303824358,"I thought this was great when it premiered on TV sponsored by IBM. Even better viewing when the mood is not interrupted by commercials -- but aren't most movies. At any rate, George C. Scott's portrayal is some of his best work and the special effects are restrained and efficiently effective. Absolutely the best, most absorbing telling of this story that you will see.",1514160000,,370,4.796875
718834,5,6303824358,"When this TV adaptation came out in 1984 I wasn't quite sure about George C. Scott playing Ebenezer Scrooge.  I mean after all wasn't he Patton!!  I guess playing the gruff self-centered general provided the perfect training ground because he is just wonderful as Scrooge.  The 1951 Alustair Sim version was my favorite since childhood, but that was about to change.  I still watch the 1951 version every Christmas Eve after Midnight Mass, as I have for just about forever...But now the George C. Scott version is our favorite.  I think Ive already watched it 7 times this year watch a great film.  Because it was made for TV the aspect isn't widescreen but the Blu-ray coversion is crystal clear and the colors are rich!  Just fabulous!!!",1514160000,,739,4.771653543307087
718835,1,6303824358,"Video failed to load twice. Instead, it played the trailer.",1514073600,,59,5.0
718836,3,6303824358,"I cant put my finger on why, but this production feels flat. The sense of place is lacking despite obvious care taken with the setsbut thats part of the problemyou never forget the scenes are sets. And despite a competent performance by the actors, the pace feels slow and plodding. Scrooge never seems affected by his past until the cemetery scene, which is disappointing; and somehow there is no great, believable joy for a transformation at the end. All in all, you could do worse than to watch this, but Ill take the Alistair Sim version over this one any day. (Marley the ghost was the exception to the tepidity. He was great.)",1514073600,,632,4.601769911504425
718837,5,6303824358,I've seen every Christmas Carol and this one is hands down the best. It's closest to the book. Many versions added scenes or altered them which weren't in the novel. It's still my favorite of all of them.,1514073600,,204,4.394736842105263
718838,2,6303824358,"I really don't want to rain on anyone's favorite holiday classics, I suppose it's a very personal choice. I first watched this when it came out in 1984, and I remember I loved it. I hadn't seen it since, and decided to watch this last night (December 23, 2017) with my family.

Sadly, after less than 30 minutes, we almost turned it off. The acting seemed stiff and hastily paced, as if the actors were dully reciting their lines for the first time. I thought George's performance was wooden and lacked depth. He was quite the blowhard, which kind of worked in the beginning, but by the end of the film I did not feel that his redemption was genuine. The film failed to convey the emotional bankruptcy of the man that is Scrooge, and it failed to give sufficient ground for him to redeem himself. It just didn't work for us.

As Scrooge's go, I don't think any of them can hold a candle to Alastair Sim's version, so maybe I have too high of a standard. But I was enormously disappointed in that my memory of what I thought was a great film turned out to be ill-founded.",1514073600,,1070,4.345
718839,5,6303824358,"I don't really have a single favorite version of the Scrooge story, but this TV version from 1984 ranks up there with the best of them.  Because it was made for TV, the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 rather than widescreen.  Blu Ray video quality is very good with crisp and clear images.  Lots of dark scenes.  Special effects are minimal in this version, sort of like one would see on stage.  This movie is mainly driven by George C. scott and his outstanding acting ability.  Lots of dialog.  Filmed in England with a mostly English cast.  The town and country scenery is very well done.  The back story line is fully fleshed out in this version showing why Scrooge was such a miserable man.  He may be the scariest Scrooge of them all.  The sound is adequate DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with mild use of surrounds for atmosphere.  Most of the sound action is up front.  Definitely worth adding to a collection to watch every few years.  The quality will not be getting better than what is on the Blu Ray.",1514073600,,996,4.430939226519337
718840,5,6303824358,Great for families.  George C Scott is fantastic.  Love this version.,1514073600,,69,5.181818181818182

718842,5,6303824358,"The ""Scrooge"" musical version with Albert Finney is cute, and everyone loves ""The Muppets Christmas Carol"", but this is THE BEST adaptation of the story. Evocative, realistic, and not over-the-top. I have to think that Dickens would approve.",1513987200,,241,5.368421052631579
718843,5,6303824358,My favorite version.,1513987200,,20,6.0
718902,5,6303824358,"Let's face it - there is no lack of truly awful versions of The Christmas Carol.

Bad acting, Cheap scenery, Missing scenes, Painful music - the list goes on and on.

THIS VERSION IS DIFFERENT.

George C Scott excels as a truly believable Ebenezer; his eventual salvation just as authentic as his former cruelty.

And he's not the only paragon here !

I begin my judgement of every Christmas Carol with MARLEY.

Far too many are wishy-washy spectres, that deserve no one's respect. Truly more ""Gravy than Grave"", as Scrooge would observe.

Frank Finlay as Marley is truly terrifying. His HOWLS will send shivers up your spine, and small children scurrying under their mother's skirts !

And Edward Woodward as Christmas Present is indeed a PRESENSE. He slams Scrooge's hypocrisies and casual cruelties right back in his face, leaving Ebenezer literally begging for mercy.

There are many other wonderful characters, all perfectly cast and acted. But I must get to the charcater that so many revile: TINY TIM.

Tiny Tim, in most versions, rarely elicits sympathy from the viewer. He's often just too cute, or too pitiful. More of an object than a human being.

I loved young Anthony Walters as young Tim. He is sweet (of course), but also believable. Anthony really brings life to him.

My family has watched many of these movies. Many bring laughter in place of the tears they are hoping for.

This is the only Christmas Carol that brought a tear to our eyes.

Yes, watch them all. Then watch this one, and you'll finally understand what all the fuss is about !",1513900800,,1561,4.754646840148699

The best Bob Cratchit, Mrs. Cratchit, and especially Tiny Tim ever. The most authentic retelling of Dickens' all-time best selling book.

  George C Scotts rendition of Scrooge is pitch perfect. He possesses the physicallity and the a ting chops to make this Scrooge both threatening and sympathetic as the story plays out.  All of the supporting cast are of course Shakespearian trained Brits and are delightful.

719068,5,6303824358,"Over the years I've watched pretty much every film performance of Dickens' iconic tale of spiritual awakening. They're all pretty good, even Mr. Magoo. LOL Recently for me, it has come down to this and the Patrick Stewart version.

It's hard to argue with the performances of two top flight actors, and both George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart are experts at their craft. (Sadly ""were"" in the case of George C. Scott).

For me, Scott's performance has a bit of an edge. From the moment he approaches his front door and it's unearthly knocker to his order of the goose, I'm lost in his cold and terrifying world. His transformation is visceral, challenging, and uplifting. Having such fine supporting actors as David Warner in the role of Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present doesn't hurt. ;-)

As I type this, this Blu ray is being offered for a no-brainer price (under ten dollars). If you haven't seen it and enjoy this tale, you won't be disappointed.

The enhanced sound and picture clarity is extraordinary compared to how I first saw this classic so many years ago... This was a family favorite around the holidays at our house, and now that I have a little one again, I know that it will be a favorite for him too!  However, the best part of this movie is the exceptional cast, and the downright stunning performance of Scrooge played by George C. Scott.  I watch this film every year at least twice, and I am always taken back by how Scott put so much personality into the character and how he takes his teachings from the spirits very much to heart.  I see this film as one of George C. Scotts finest performances... Yes, I saw Patton, but in this role, I don't think any other actor put this much effort into this role than Scott.  He makes you want to hate him in the beginning, feel empathy for him in the middle of the movie, and then feeling sorry for him at the finale.  Once the transformation occurs in the heart of Scrooge, Scott is still so much into the new character as he was the old one.  At the end, you will see a happy ending completing this family classic, and also I feel the best performance of a lifetime for George C. Scott...

719599,5,6303824358,"This is a favorite film of mine, ever since it was broadcast on CBS back in 1984; I previously owned a pretty good copy of it on laserdisc.

I wanted to get the film on DVD; but unfortunately, all the Fox DVD versions that I've come across over the last 15 years have cropped the film to a 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio -- by cropping off the top and bottom of the film to fit a widescreen TV.  The film was originally released in full screen 1.33:1 (because it was shot for TV); to make matters worse, the cropping is fairly sloppy -- a lot of head-tops go missing.

Thus, I was very delighted to read that the Blu Ray release of the film would be be in the full-screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  Upon reviewing the Blu Ray, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it's a very good video transfer -- much better than I would expect for a relatively obscure film.

The picture, for the most part, shows very little grain (though some of that may be lost in the foggy/hazy shots of urban London that make up a lot of the film.)  Also, the colors are the best I've seen in a video transfer of this film: lacking the greenish tinge of the old laserdisc copy, and saturated to just about the right degree (unlike the DVD transfer, which tends to make everyone look a bit tanned -- not a good look for these characters. :-) )

So if you've been waiting to buy a copy of this film on disc, I doubt you'll find anything better than this for some time.  Very satisfactory!",1486425600,7,1465,4.244604316546763

719696,5,6303824358,"This is my yearly Christmas viewing tradition as it rivals the best work of George C. Scott in Patton. His performance just a few years before his death was remarkable in defining Scrooge in a more complex way which is fascinating in Scott was a large robust man and everyone thinks of Scrooge as thin demonic type character.
Mr. Scott carries this entire cast which is the weak point in English actors. It is though Scott who makes you feel the subtleties which created Scrooge in a lifetime of neglect which all stemmed from his mother dying in child birth, and being neglected by his father, he chose money as the thing which would not betray him, as he never trusted love when it was offered.
This is a profoundly deep performance of George C. Scott creating the  defining role.",1484697600,,782,4.585714285714285

I give this 4 stars because, while it is one of the best, it is not the best telling of Dickens' tale. We don't really see Schrooge change until the very end - he appears touched but not moved by the first two Ghosts' visits. I personally think Patrick Stewart's version is better, but I am sure others will disagree. That's fine. If you like George C.

I was not happy with streaming the film however. The movie ""crashed"" at least 5 times while I was watching it. And even worse, when it crashed and reloaded to reloaded earlier in the film each time to part I'd already seen. So I then had to skip forward in the film, which is pretty inexact. It's not like speeding through a video tape where you can see an image on the screen of where you are in the movie. All you get is a frozen image of where you were and a status bar at the bottom about how far you are in the film you will be when you start it again (a little like a timecode marker at the bottom).

I ordered this because it was cheaper than replacing my old DVD and because I thought it might be better - a high quality version I could access from any device. In the end I found the streaming format to be a disappointment and I wish I had just bought a Blu-ray instead.",1483056000,,1066,4.095693779904306

Although I love George C. Scott, I do not think he was the actor best suited for this version at the time this version of the story was filmed. He comes across as a little less scared and a little less joyful than what the story would seem to compel. In short, I don't thing he had his heart in the role.

We try to watch it every year. Just wish the streaming function on Amazon Prime worked effectively. We have Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and other streaming services - and all work fine. However, every time we've tried to use Amazon Prime, the streaming stops, buffers, resets multiple times, switches episodes, etc. Such a frustration that we rarely use the service, even though it's free with our Prime account. Took 45 minutes to get the streaming to play without stopping, but it was worth it in the end. George C.

Scott, as a miser, cold, irascible, downright mean, convinces, even as he does an about face to warm, kind, generous.  Even his American accent doesn't separate him from the parade of British cast members--themselves a brilliant group.  The sets, immersed in fog or coldly brilliant sunlight, are characters in themselves, especially when enhance by carolers  singing street-side as horse drawn carriages go by.  I watch this movie every year, always finding something fresh to appreciate.",1481500800,,604,5.239583333333333

721316,5,6303824358,"Although I've seen quite a few versions of this classic Christmas story, including both film and stage renditions, by far, this is my favorite.  George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge is both brilliant and inspired.  The Scrooge he creates is certainly miserly and hardened of heart, yet also a complex man, one who has been hurt over the years and, as a result, has hardened himself with the protection of wealth and success.  Despite all, however, he manages to keep a sense of humor and a shred of goodness and justice within.  This version helps the viewer understand better that this man, beneath all of his nasty bravura and shrewd manipulations, is actually quite lonely and even afraid of dying alone.  Thus, his remarkable transformation after the third ghostly visit makes sense under Scott's masterful portrayal and the director's steady hand.  The sets of Industrial-Era London are well done, and the supporting cast also does a fine job.  The ghostly visitors are also handled well with a nice blend of special effects.  Although this is one of the more ""modern"" film versions of the classic, it definitely captures the spirit of Dickens and his time.",1454544000,2,1164,4.933333333333334

Christmas Present is awesome in his commentary about attitudes that still apply to the big headed, self aggrandizing worshipers of Mammon, our ""elite"".  I will note that a key part of this movie is a human being, gaining insight about himself at the behest of a series of experiences whose reality is never proven.  It is not a religious movie... it is a humanist one.  If you read up Dickens you will learn that he was a humanist and had personally experienced some poverty and displacement as a child.",1451606400,,569,4.66

I could not even watch it all, kids would be bored and leave the room.  I bought this thinking it was a different version.  Skip this and get Scrooge with Albert Finney.  The difference is night and day. Kids and adults will love Scrooge.  I will donate my copy of this to Goodwill.  It is horrible.  In my mind George C Scott is a wonderful actor, this is not what I expect of him.
If I had to discribe this I would say a bunch of non actors watched Scrooge and tried to copy it, and failed.

To me, this 1984 made for TV rendition of the tale is the version against which I compare all others.  The supporting cast is very strong, and the script, language and setting are very faithful to Dickens.  But the centerpiece here is the tour de force performance that George C. Scott delivers as Ebenezer Scrooge.  We don't have a miserly two-dimensional curmudgeon as so many other versions portray.  Scott gives us insight into the damaged soul that became this reclusive Midas...and when his redemption is at hand...we can feel that soul in its abject grief. And the transformation afterwards...no other Scrooge exudes the pure newborn joy of Christmas that Scott gives us at the end of this film.  I remember watching this the night it initially aired on television, and it is just as impactful now as it was then for the first time.  A treasure to be sure...and my favorite Holiday movie.",1450742400,,1013,4.820809248554913

Scott, but it just feels like he's just going through the motions in this film.  The story feels hurried as if they take no joy in telling me the tale.  I understand the time when this movie was made and the special effects are lacking, to the point of being laughable.  The actors who play Jacob Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Past also feel like they're just doing their job on a Monday morning, no depth of feeling.  I know this is some folks favorite version of this story and more power to them.  This movie is not without good parts, but over all I continue to be disappointed with this movie every year.

721883,5,6303824358,"I love A CHRISTMAS CAROL in just about all its forms.  The book, of course, The Muppet Christmas Carol, Alistair Sims' production, even Mister Magoo's, all of them are very good,.and I'll happily watch any of them.  But this one, to me, stays closest to the spirit of the book, and while there are things that I don't like (Jacob Marley's ghost needed an echo chamber, Angela Pleasence' Ghost of Christmas Past needed a new hairdo, the Ghost of Christmas yet to come needs to give E.T. back his finger and oil his wheels) they are minor and easily ignored in my enjoyment.  Some versions take the plot and run away with it (Scrooge and Marley putting old Fezziwig out of business, and Belle ending up a charitable spinster, for example, in the Sims version).  This one generally follows it very well.

From a history standpoint, the costumes are well-researched, and by them I can pinpoint the decade in which the story is set.  The conversations and turns of phrase ring true, as well.  It is all very well done, right down to Tiny Tim truly looking like a sickly child rather than a jolly, round-cheeked fellow in one of the other shows.

The cast is impeccable, from George C. Scott: ""Don't beg on this corner, boy!"" to Edward Woodward, ""It's all Bob Cratchitt can AFFORD!""  to Susannah York ""I'll give him a piece of my mind - and hope he has a good appetite for it!"" to David Warner, who puts in a good performance as Bob Cratchitt, to Roger Rees, who plays Fred Hollowell and narrates the story.  As one who was in amateur theater, I have to say that the movie gives all the signs of a cast that 'clicked' and enjoyed each other's company.

I think one of the earmarks of a truly good production (at least for the person who perceives it as such) is the way that aspects of it come back to the mind after the show is over.  ""Aw wouldn't 'ave loitered about if 'e 'ad been catchin'!"", ""As tight as your Uncle Scrooge's Purse Strings!"", ""You're devilish hard to have a conversation with!""  I like most of the productions but, for me, George C. Scott's version is one of 'the indispensables'.  Do yourself a favor and watch it.  Even if it does not become your favorite, I think you will enjoy it.

...Oh - and the words to 'God Bless Us Every One', the song sung during the closing credits, are now available if you do a Google Search.",1424736000,12,2339,4.429906542056075

Scott captures the mean-spirited, cold disregard of Scrooge as none other has ever done....and then captures the hopeful joy of a rebirth of that character.  Scott, with his choleric personality was born for this role.  Loved it so much that I bought it and this is the version my family watches every Christmas!",1423872000,,454,4.512195121951219

721973,3,6303824358,"I bought this Blu-ray based on all the 5 star reviews.  I also bought the Alastair Sim version, which I feel is the definitive version of the tale.  While this version may be more ""faithful"" to the original text, I was not very impressed with the movie.  George C. Scott (GCS) appeared to be less overbearing and menacing than Sim's version of Scrooge.  When Marley's ghost first appears, GCS appears more annoyed, rather than terrified.  He then goes into a monotonous monologue about the cause of the apparition, something about undigested bread, etc.  Compared to the terrified look on Sim's face, this version seems to be just going through the motions of ""reading"" the text of the book.  GCS seems to be getting more and more bored with the appearance of each of the Christmas Spirits.  Bob Cratchit seems more annoyed rather than fearful of his boss in this version, except for the final scene when he arrives late for work the day after Christmas.  Given that this is a modern filming, the effects accompanying the travels of Scrooge with the spirits could have been done much better.  They seemed to try and keep it in line of the effects from the 1951 film.  The scene in Cratchit's house for the Christmas meal was more heartfelt and poignant in the 1951 film.  There were many other areas where this movie fell behind the 1951 film.  It may be more ""faithful"" to the story, but it just seemed like the actors were going through the motions.  It may be better than other renditions of this story, but is a pale second to the 1951 version with Alastair Sim.",1422489600,2,1566,4.606498194945848

Scott brings his surly cantankerousness to Ebeneezer Scrooge in a way that really breathes new life into that role.  David Warner also does a stellar job as Bob Cratchit as do the other key characters, played faithfully by an all-star cast of mostly British actors.

Correct lighting , meaningful supporting cast absolutely involving period music that capsures the essence of England and you feel cold of London. When marleys ghost comes in through the door  you hear the lonely violin of the past .. and his trajectory to infinity.

722485,3,6303824358,"I enjoyed the actual production, however George C Scott didn't give as emotional a performance as I felt Charles Dickens would've wanted Scrooge to be exhibiting. Ebeneezer Scrooge was an opinionated, crusty old guy with a lot of emotional baggage he'd been dragging around for a long time and the actor didn't show enough energy or edginess to make me really have contempt for his behavior
which eventually should turn to compassion and a happy ending for him. Scott's  voice was too monotone for this role. It just didn't work for me.  I still love the 1970 musical version of ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney as one of the best characterizations of old Scrooge and I'm not a big musical fan. Finney is outstanding in the role.",1419811200,3,725,4.746031746031746

George C Scott did an amazing job, and this film seemed authentic, however I definitely do not recommend for kids, or for anyone who wants to be 'in' the Christmas spirit after it's over.  --or for anyone who is feeling low or depressed.

The ending was like, oh yeah and by the way, Tiny Tim walked, Scrooge changed, and was filled with the Christmas spirit.  The end.

They both had nightmares, and seriously questioned my movie choices.

If you are dark, brooding, and really want to spend 2 hours in a dank dark rendition, then this is your movie.

722871,5,6303824358,"The transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge from mean-spirited miser to chastened benefactor is as much a part of the Christmas tradition as mistletoe and holly.  The question is, why purchase George C. Scott's performance in this adaption for television?  The short answer: it's gorgeous to look at.  It was filmed in color, on location in wintry Shrewsbury (with St. Paul's Cathedral superimposed on the background, lest we forget we're in London).  We can feel the icy cold embracing the city, just as we can feel the icy coldness flowing through Scrooge's pallid blood veins.  That's the genius.  This film puts us there, on the streets of frosty London, inside Scrooge's frigid counting house, at the Exchange, in the countryside of Scrooge's youth, in the bustling market place on Christmas morn, and with Bob Cratchit and his family inside their cramped yet warm Camden Town dwelling.  We get to know these people.  We become familiar with where and how they live.  It's like spending time with some distant, dysfunctional family that, as the story progresses, is transformed by the midnight visitation of three spirits.  Is George C. Scott's Scrooge more convincing than Alastair Sim's?  Doesn't matter.  While both movies tell the same story, they are quite different in the telling.  Scott and Sim are individually brilliant, if not individually different in their approach to extraordinarily complex characterizations.  Both accounts set cathedral bells ringing on Christmas day.",1417478400,2,1485,5.2905982905982905

722934,5,6303824358,"I don't know how many times I've seen this performance of Dickens' classic, but I recall seeing it on TV when it first came out in 1984 and being bowled over at the sight.  The acting is excellent, the story (which always differs a little for each movie version) is good -- suitable for the cast and the mood this version sets.
  But it's the cinematography and the sets that are the most striking thing for me.  I had never seen anything close to this at that time, and not much better since.  And that's not because the previous offering were bad -- they certainly weren't that -- it's just that this one did it better, probably because the technology was so much improved over that in 1938 and 1951, when two very good movie versions of the Dickens' classic were made.
  The colors here are not bright, they're rather subdued, but very fitting, the kind of thing that keeps me looking at them as much as watching the story itself unfold.  But then, I know the story backwards and forwards so I'm usually drawn to the things that stand out:  for this version, it's the scenery.  Even the nastier, seamier parts of London look almost inviting on screen here.
  While it's nice to read the story, it's often every bit as good and instructive to see what others see in the tale, and to put some of those ideas into the background, the acting, and the sound.  The sound really was outstanding -- it draws the attention to things.  I actually found it a little too loud and had to turn down the volume.
  I find I often prefer a movie to the book, but only if it does justice to the story and gives you more in the process.  This rendition does just that.",1416960000,,1652,4.34640522875817

723125,5,6303824358,"Excellent version. Scott shines in his portrayal of Scrooge from the beginning to the end, for it's sincerity and feeling without being hammy. Fred and Clara are compelling for their part - their reaction to their changed Uncle is especially endearing. And the Ghost of Christmas Present is unforgettable both in his moments of humor, and his chastising Ebenezer with fierce sarcasm and unflinching truth. Tiny Tim's is believable, but his ""sick kid"" make-up is a little over done. And Angela Pleasance is slightly strange as the Ghost of Christmas Past, but other than those small complaints, this movie is a keeper, and in our house, a Christmas tradition, along with ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"".",1410566400,,699,5.086956521739131

723284,5,6303824358,"I've watched George C. Scott's Christmas Carol since I was tiny and I've seen numerous other films of this classic story and to me none capture the character of Scrooge and the spirit of the story better than this film. No offense Jim Carry.
No one makes a more sinister and snarky Scrooge than Scott, his insults sting, his cruelty is genuine, his tumor snappy, and his miraculous reformation draws tears. Though the special effects are out of date the excellence of the actors supersedes all that. All the characters look like they came from that century, the spirits of Christmas are as spiteful and funny as Scrooge; the Spirit of Christmas future gives you the heeby jeebies and the dark dread of death. The sets really take you back to the Victorian age, they feel authentic in every way right down to the dirty dinge of the coal burning days. But most importantly, the film captures the spirit and reverence of Dickens' story like none other I have seen, and really strikes at the heart on the plight of the poor and the precariousness of Scrooge's spiritual welfare. The Muppet version certainly has its charms; but for really feeling the meaning of Christmas with depth of feeling and all seriousness this is the one to see. This has been my family's Christmas tradition to watch this together for well over 20 years.",1398211200,,1326,4.695278969957082
723285,5,6303824358,I've seen most of the Christmas Carol movies and this one is my favorite. The Muppet version would be my 2nd. George C. Scott is excellent as Scrooge. The scenery and costume design are authentic and you feel as though you've been transported back in time. The 4 ghosts (including Marley's) are really good. It doesn't digress from the book. The blue-ray was gave good viewing along with our surround sound stereo. It's one of those DVD's you return to each Christmas season because it's that good and memorable.,1397433600,2,512,4.764044943820225

Scott models his performance after, and does so with amazing talent.  When I watch it his acting astonishes me.  I see Sim's performance merge with Scott's in so many of the scenes.  Yet Scott certainly also brings his own unique talents to the film.

723761,5,6303824358,"First of all, I love ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens.

If you have never read the book before, you should, as you will see how each movie puts their own spin on the story. I like the Alastair Sim and Patrick Stewart versions very much as well as The Muppet Christmas Carol (you can never go wrong with Michael Caine). However, none is as intense as this one. George C. Scott owns this part. The photography is not as sharp as one would expect and it WAS FILMED with subtle colors and is also more dark than light for added effect.

But it is the audio that really gets special treatment. If you are familiar with the DVD version (and even the VHS) you know that when he encounters the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, that the audio of the ghost is downright horrible and distorted. Here it is balanced and toned down considerably.

For that reason alone, I gladly upgraded from DVD to blu-ray.",1389571200,,900,4.377245508982036

723814,5,6303824358,"This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol. It was also my mother's favorite version. I had seen it in the theater on a class trip in school when it came out. Then I remember the first time it aired on TV I painstakingly sat there with my giant 50 pound top load Panasonic console VHS machine pausing it to edit out the commercials.

It was tradition that her and I would watch this every Christmas Eve. My dad worked nights and always worked Christmas Eve, so it was just her and I. All the Christmas lights would be on, dinner for the next day would be cooking. We always had a real tree and between that and the food it smelled so good.

We watched that VHS every Christmas Eve until she passed away. So, this movie is kind of special to me.

I can only assume since the Format details of the Blu ray say it's 4:3 and the Aspect Ratio details say it's 2.40:1 that this is the 80's TV broadcast version and the sides were chopped off for TV broadcast. So I'm hoping that somewhere the widescreen version of this is still in existence waiting to be restored and released.

That said, for the version this is, it is really good. This version was cleaned up, it's sharp, clear, blacks are nice, colors are nice, audio is great, it's far better than the original VHS and DVD version, but it's not widescreen and it could be better.

I've seen a LOT of adaptations of A Christmas Carol as my partner collects any version he can find from old silent movies to radio adaptations. The biggest mistake I find with many interpretations of Scrooge is that he is usually played as a caricature - too harsh and mean at the beginning of the story. Consequently- the change at the end of the story is over-the-top and unrealistic. With this kind of performance, the audience is allowed to distance themselves from the main character and smugly think that they could never be as bad as old Scrooge. By trying a more realistic style in his turn as Scrooge, Scott makes the story-telling even more chilling and brings home the point that any one of us could be Scrooge! He is not so miserly and mean as he is callous and capitalistic- he fought and earned his- let everyone else do the same.
He doesn't chew the scenery like Patrick Stewart, Jim Carrey or any number of other actors who have tried the role- but try this version- I think you'll find it extremely enjoyable and believable!",1388448000,,1180,4.570754716981132

724042,5,6303824358,"Every year, one of my favorite activities during the Christmas Holiday season has been watching the long, and growing list of Christmas movies.  The highlight of this, for me, is watching at least three or four of the many movie versions of Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"".  Though I enjoy several versions, for years the one I always looked forward to the most was the Alastair Sim version, which seemed a major cut above all the others.  That continued until I saw the George C. Scott version and the older version immediately dropped a rank -- not because there is anything so much wrong with the Alastair Sim version.  It is still a great movie.  It's just that there is so much right with the later entry.

George C. Scott was a marvelous actor and brought to this part an incredible array of emotion and heart.  Often, it seemed like he rendered pages of dialogue superfluous with just a simple expression or gesture.  His Scrooge was human and believable, and depending upon the  context, reprehensible, intimidating, vulnerable, pitiable, and even admirable.  It was an amazing portrayal and every time I watch it I feel like I am seeing something special and precious.

It seems difficult to justify why I like this one so much without at least discussing how it contrasts with other offerings but, again, I am not dismissing them -- merely pointing out ways that I feel that this version improves upon them.  I would not watch so many versions if I did not find some unique value in each one.

One immediate advantage of this version over many of the classic offerings is in the cinematography, which is quite good, particularly for a made-for-TV movie, and which manages to capture both the beauty and the squalor of the period and place.  The older versions, being in black and white, would have difficulty competing -- in the hands of a master, truly wonderful visions can be created in black and white, but lesser mortals generally require a much broader palette to achieve a result as grand.  None of the black and white versions attempted anything very grand visually and in that regard they did not stand out from many of the B-movies of the era.  Visual style has value but for a story like this it is, admittedly, secondary to the story-telling and the message it conveys.

One item which I consider a make-or-break point for any representation of this story is the way in which Scrooge's reclamation is portrayed.  Many versions are unconvincing because of poor handling of this point: his transformation is too rapid to be believed; or his bitterness is so heavily accentuated that it seems unlikely that he could be transformed; etc.  This is where both the Alastair Sim  and the George C. Scott versions excel.  The character's heart slowly thaws as the spirits reveal each of their lessons and we see them, in spite of repeated attempts to defend their past, begin to comprehend the error of their ways.  As much as I enjoyed watching Alastair Sim's Scrooge on his pilgrimage towards redemption, George C. Scott's Scrooge was more convincing to me, in part because of the amazing breadth of expression which Scott brought to the part but also because Sim's Scrooge was, to me, less believable from the beginning.  Sim's Scrooge did not seem to me to be a man simply hardened by the trials, real and imagined, of a hard life but almost seemed to have a touch of evil in him.  At times it seemed to me that his mistreatment of others was not just out of irritation and contempt but was calculated to be hurtful, whereas Scott's Scrooge, in general, simply dismissed others unless they placed themselves in his path.  He even showed a slight degree of civility when it cost him nothing to do so.

Another area where both Sim and Scott excelled was in the scene upon waking Christmas morning.  Much of the dialogue is difficult and seems rather unnatural but both of them managed to pull it off in a very believable manner.  Even as fine an actor as Patrick Stewart, stumbled over some of those lines.  The later scene of Scrooge visiting his nephew, Fred, however, I felt, played much better in the Scott version than in the Sim version.  The Sim version is still very good but Scott's version is superb -- his contrition and humility and new-found affection towards his nephew and his nephew's wife is heartwarming and utterly credible.

Though Sim and Scott both did outstanding work and, were one trying to apply some sort of score to determine a ""winner"" one could easily come down on either side, I feel that the decisive blow is probably in the supporting cast.  The cast of the Scott version is truly stellar -- nearly every character stands out over any of the earlier versions.  Particularly notable are David Warner as Bob Cratchit, Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Roger Rees as Scrooge's nephew, Fred.  The latter two were so effective that when I am watching other versions of the story and their characters are onscreen, in my head I usually hear the dialogue from this version rather than the one I am watching.  The only two characters which I might feel less enthusiastic about are those of Marley's ghost and the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-come.  Marley's ghost was portrayed as very over-the-top dramatic.  On the one hand, it makes the fear on Scrooge's face, which continues even past the initial revelation that the ghost is Marley's ghost, seem more believable.  On  the other hand, it is unexplained why he would speak in such a loud, imposing voice.  As for the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-come, though the part is credited to the actor, Michael Carter, for much of its onscreen presence it looks like little more than than a ""holocaust-cloak"" draped over some sort of wooden scaffolding being wheeled around the stage -- it looks a good deal less-than ominous and without a the creepy sound-effects would probably evoke more laughter than anything else.

Finally, there is some beautiful music in the soundtrack for this version which sets the scenes quite nicely.  This movie is the whole package.  It has a few blemishes, but overall it is top-notch.  And while this story has been told many times, in many ways, and there are a great many film versions to love -- this is the one that I love most of all.

The DVD version has scene-selection but no extras and is presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which, inasmuch as this was a 1984 made-for-TV movie, I suspect that was the aspect ratio in which it was shot.  IMHO, it has everything it needs -- and if you love this  story, I recommend that you buy this DVD so that you can enjoy it every Christmas.  This version doesn't appear on television as often as the others (probably the rights to show it are more expensive) so owning it is the best way to ensure it is available to view.",1388102400,,6799,4.693086003372681

724166,5,6303824358,"George C. Scott makes a terrifying Scrooge with that imposing voice and manner; he's also the heartiest of the Scrooges currently on film.  For a TV film, this is very well made.  But as with most adaptations, this one also makes its share of changes to the famous story.  (I don't see the difficulty in remaining faithful to a story that doesn't need to be ""improved"" upon or altered in any fashion.  It should be an easy task but people will tamper in inexcusable ways.)  At least this version features the tiniest Tim ever (Anthony Walters).  It also includes the best Marley ever put on film (Frank Finlay, who plays the tortured spirit filled with great anguish and anger.  He makes you believe he's truly there on Scrooge's behalf).  But.  I didn't quite care for the Ghost of Christmas Present (Edward Woodward), jolly one minute, snide and frightening the next.  He seemed a bit manic for his purpose.

724226,5,6303824358,"This is an accessible telling of one of the best stories of Christmas ever told. The sights, sounds and feel of the Dickensian London are captured here like nowhere else. We are far removed from that in our modern times. Most of all, if you will suspend your belief that George C. Scott was in fact Gen. Patton himself out there standing in front of full-screen American flag, you will love Scott's performance. I've read the reviews and agree that there is some very fine acting in other productions. I imagine that George C. Scott built his Ebenezer by standing on those shoulders, then adding his own portrayal of hubris. But it isn't just Scott who shines. Older movies water down the grim ugliness of the real story from Dickens. Christmas Present is portrayed here like nowhere else I have seen. He opens his robes to reveal the children he protects, Ignorance and Want. If you will allow, it will strike you down to your knees. The poor, unemployed father who is huddled with his faithful wife and family under a bridge on Christmas Day - their honest love for each other in their squalor surpasses the circumstances of Scrooge's measured splendor.

When the chastised and humbled Ebenezer accepts his nephew's Christmas Day invitation, have your box of Kleenex handy. He steps out of his protective shell and into the warm sunshine of redemption. The joy in the family and ready acceptance of their uncle, well, that is exactly how love works.

I hate to compare this to the Patton performance, which was astounding. He gave the great general the honor he was due. But this performance had a positive affect on my heart. I understand that writing this story had the most profound effect on Charles Dickens himself. If you are in London, look for a walking tour of London and go on the Charles Dickens Walk. You'll enjoy seeing the places where Charles Dickens lived and wrote his stories. Scrooge may have been an exaggerated self-portrait for Dickens.

I read the one star critiques and others who argue that Alistair Sim was a far better Scrooge. Perhaps. And I wasn't born when Barrymore played Scrooge on radio productions. I'm sure my grandparents would prefer Barrymore over Sim by ""leaps and bounds."" The older production quality cannot live up to modern expectations. If you're some kind of acting purist, get the 1951 Alistair Sim and a few others. Then get this one so you can actually enjoy the story and experience what life looked like in a time when the poor didn't have a ""safety net"" or anything else to keep them warm in winter. This has the production details to show you the look and feel of a time that we can hardly imagine anymore. You can enjoy this in secret while telling your snooty friends that you only bought this ""for the kids.""",1387584000,,2766,4.68724279835391

724379,5,6303824358,"Of the countless versions of A CHRISTMAS CAROL that are out there from Reginald Owen to Bill Murray to Jim Carrey, this version from 1984 remains my personal favorite although I concede that the 1951 Alastair Sim movie is the best of the lot, I had just come through a rough patch when this version first appeared and was feeling pretty Scroogelike myself when I saw it and by the time it was over I, like Scrooge, had been transformed. It took me back to my childhood and to the joys I associated with Christmas and things started to look up and have continued to do so for almost 30 years now.

I had seen most of the earlier versions with the animated Mr Magoo one holding sway because of the songs it contained (remember this was the era of RUDOLPH, THE RED NOSED REINDEER and FROSTY THE SNOWMAN). I really enjoyed the Alastair Sim version (known as SCROOGE) which I didn't see until I was in college. It really highlighted the ghost story aspects of the tale with its stunning black & white photography and the visits of the 3 spirits. Alastair Sim was and is in a class by himself but what gives the nod to the 1984 version, IMHO, is the total package.

Like the recent version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS, this version is less theatrical and more realistic. George C. Scott plays Scrooge as a man battered by life and poor choices made along the way. No wonder he's the way he is. Despite his surface meanness, we can sense the wounded human being underneath and the peeling away of those years of hardness to reveal the true Scrooge is what makes this version so special. The best supporting cast ever from Edward Woodward's Ghost of Christmas Present to David Warner & Susannah York as the Cratchits to Frank Finlay's remarkable Marley are a joy to behold.

Director Clive Donner (STEALING HEAVEN) had been the editor on the Sim version back in 1951 so he knew a thing or two about filming the story. Most importantly he knew that the story and its message should be first and foremost not the character of Scrooge. Scott is a strong Scrooge but never at the expense of what's happening and he gives an effective, restrained performance. The settings, the costumes, the photography, everything is just right in what was a small budget, glorified TV movie. If you've never seen it, rent or stream it and see if you aren't transformed.",1386806400,2,2336,4.5439429928741095

However, this Blu-Ray version doesn't seem to offer that much of an improvement in terms of the image - looks like they just used a regular DVD master. Also, I bought this version mainly because Amazon's product details claim it's 2.40:1, so I was hoping that earlier versions were pan-and-scan for old TVs. Actually the film on the Blu-Ray is 1.33:1, just like my old DVD, so presumably that's how it was filmed. Why can't Amazon get these details right? Surely it's not that hard.

@ Charlie: I realize the film was made for TV. That's why I have a problem with Amazon's product details, which claim it to be widescreen.

Without going into the story (which should be self-evident to anyone not hailing from Mars), this production has the best Scrooge since Sim, the best nephew of all, and the best Bob Cratchitt, this is the best overall production to date.  It remains the ONLY film with a genuinely sick-looking Tim, too.  The ghosts are magnificent - Angela Pleasance is perfect as the disdaining Ghost of Christmas Past; the Ghost of Christmas Future is imposing, and the standout (hard in a top quality production) is Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present.  The productions looks wonderful - it was directed by Clive Donner, who (incidentally) was the film editor  on the Sim version in 1951.

But when 3 ghosts show Scrooge the errors of his ways, he reforms...and treats everyone with good will.

A classic family movie with excellent support by David Warner, and Edward Woodward.

Highly recommended.

The package on mine states an aspect ratio of 1:33:1 but it was actually a widescreen format - which I was happy about.,1385337600,,356,4.220588235294118
724550,5,6303824358,"'Old Marley was dead, as dead as dead can be.  If we do not understand that, nothing good can come from this story'.  The reclamation of Scrooge's life holds promise for any who have lost sight of what real life is. The deep regard author Charles Dickens had for the ills of his society and the poor who suffered so miserably speaks to our current day in such a timely manner. The movie, true to the book, heralds the ageless truth: man's inhumanity to man is inexcusable.  Not only so, it robs the financially blessed of true joy and life.  Geo C Scott's performance as Scrooge is amazing.  The entire cast is exemplary. The setting and scenery are chillingly authentic. In the dark and cold of night the ghost of Marley comes to visit, bearing a long, heavy chain of regret. Scrooge attempts to deflect Marley's guilt, ""But you always were such a good man of business!"". Old Marley roars in reply,  ""A good man of business? The common welfare was my business!  And now I am destined to go through eternity seeing the good I might have done but did not."".  Three spirits visit Scrooge that night and reveal not what he had gained but what he had lost, the third spirit revealing the bitter end of it all. The most wonderful gift of all is a second chance at life.  Will Scrooge seize it?",1385337600,,1288,4.423728813559322

The movie itself is very good. There are a few versions of this classic. One has Patrick Stewart, but I really like this one. I think this Scrooge fits the part just a little better, but that's just my opinion.

I don't even particularly like movies with songs, and this one is STILL better.  George C. Scott was born to be a curmudgeon, and he curmudgeons so very convincingly and reforms so delightfully that you will find YOURSELF skipping around the room, asking small boys in the street ""What day is today?""  And then rejoicing that YOU HAVEN'T MISSED CHRISTMAS!  At least I did.
Tiny Tim is sweet but NOT tiresomely so, and Bob Cratchitt is the father and husband and all around nice guy that you should have married, but didn't, because you were 19 and dumb, and now you are sorry, but it is too late.  Never mind.  You can still watch this movie and fall into a time and place and story that can make anyone smile.  If it doesn't, see a cardiac specialist.  See if you are missing a heart.
 If it is Christmas, and you are glad you got this film, go out and buy some Christmas presents for a needy family.  That way, you will know you REALLY got this film.",1359244800,,1119,4.37378640776699

Our entire family enjoyed this version of a Christmas Carol.  We all agreed it is a new holiday tradition for us.  If I had one criticism it would be that I would have like to have seen more interaction protrayed between the redeemed Scrooge and the Crachet family.  George C. Scott is just so great to watch!

The one for Christmas present needs an undershirt! Overall, I enjoyed George C. Scott.and felt truly blessed by Tiny Tim and his family who did a wonderful job ,as did Scrooge's nephew.

725768,1,6303824358,"There is nothing believable about this version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" nothing at all.

Everyone is busy ""ACTING!,"" and no one more so than George C. Scott, who is overacting most of the time, and who has to be the worst Scrooge I've ever seen. One can see the wheels turning in his actor's head as he attempts to ""be different"" than others who have played Scrooge. It's like George Costanza doing the opposite of what one would expect. Well it doesn't work. Underplaying this and overplaying that just to be different is as pathetic as it is obvious. There's nothing menacing about this Scrooge, nor is there anything to like once his redemption is complete. Scott doesn't even attempt to employ a British accent in his portrayal, a fact emphasized in scenes with  his fellow actors David Warner (Bob Cratchit) and Roger Rees (Fred), whose light accents stand in stark contrast to Scott's very American diction (the looks on those actors' faces betray a feeling of ""aren't you even going to try?"" when it comes to Scott's lack of British inflection). Worse, his sometimes halting delivery gives one the feeling that he is struggling to remember his lines! Very disappointing.

Like Scott's acting, the production itself strains at its overproduced seams, the cinematic equivalent of employing a 100-piece orchestra to play a nursery rhyme. The simplicity - and therefore, the beauty - of this story has been driven from this version through the sheer weight of it taking itself way too seriously.

I can't believe the raves people give this turkey. I thought it came off as a bad TV version of the story...so I wasn't surprised to learn that it was indeed a TV production from the 1980s. The scene of Tiny Tim's ""God bless us, everyone"" is as overplayed as it is embarrassing. One can almost see the actors in the scene straining through what must have been the ninth or tenth take of a scene that STILL lacks all honesty, and that hasn't a second of believability.

BTW - the musical score also feeds along the bottom, with the kind of nondescript and unmemorable stuff found in the typical made-for-TV production. Compared to the brilliant score by Richard Addinsell for the 1951 British version with Alastair Sim, well, there's no comparison. This score reminded me of the fare one gets with Hammer's series of Dracula movies.

Bah, humbug!

The aforementioned Alastair Sim version is still the best by leaps and bounds. I'd also recommend Disney's version with Jim Carrey, which is a whole lot better than it had any right to be on paper, and which perhaps (and surprisingly) sticks closer to Dickens' little novella than most other versions. I say that as a person not all that enamored with Carrey's usual schtick, and who was ready to write off Disney's effort as a misguided failure. But it works, and works well. Might as well give the devil his due.",1355702400,4,2860,4.777327935222672

725770,5,6303824358,"This is the ""Christmas Carol"" we watch every year without fail.

In some ways it's not as accurate to the story; Dickens wrote Scrooge as a somewhat mentally ill miser, and Scott portrays him as a completely pragmatic Victorian businessman. Personally, I think that's got more resonance, especially as we see rich folks pillaging our society and recommending ""decreasing the surplus population"".

I utterly adore the Ghost of Christmas Present in this version. He is wonderful.

The costuming is excellent, too- it tracks current styles for the eras shown very well, to my amateur knowledge.

And- mostly, it's very dry and underplayed. Almost no scenery chewing (which is also unlike Dickens' source story!).

Having just listened to the unabridged audio book - I've read the book itself at least ten times - I realized that this version of the film not only maddeningly adds scenes that weren't in the book (Scrooge meeting Tiny Tim outside his place of work? Huh?!) but also moves scenes around unnecessarily (Scrooge's meeting with the gentlemen seeking money for the poor happens at the Exchecquer (sp?) and not in his office). And why they saw fit to add a scene of Scrooge's father is beyond me.

Production values are good, but I don't believe for a second that the houses were so well lit in 19th century London.

DVD quality was superb. Excellent colors and the non-widescreen ratio is correct for a film that was made for television in the 1980s.

Not the best version of the film by far - 1951's SCROOGE (which added scenes too, much to my consternation!) is still the tops - but not the worst either.

Still waiting for the definitive film version (the animated Robert Zemeckis version from a few years back was more of a horror movie than a ghost story).",1355443200,3,1154,4.507177033492823
725860,1,6303824358,"Guess I should have checked before I bought this blu-ray, but I have never seen a fullscreen blu-ray before so I just assumed that it would be widescreen.  Alas, it is 4:3, which makes no sense because almost everyone using a blu-ray player has a 16:9 ratio HDTV so it should at the very least be anamorphic at 16:9 if not at its original ratio (probably 1.85:1 I would guess).  It's possible that this was a made for TV movie, in which case the source material would be 4:3 but I doubt it, as this movie is very cinematic and most likely was released theatrically.  Luckily, I noticed it before removing the shrinkwrap so I can still send this one back to Amazon, which I will!

edit (1/10/13): to those saying that this was originally a TV release and therefore the 4:3 aspect ratio is correct, that's actually likely incorrect.  Per wikipedia: ""It originally aired on CBS on December 17, 1984 in the United States but was released theatrically in Great Britain.""  Therefore, it was likely filmed and released in U.K. theaters in widescreen (probably 1.85:1) and cropped (pan and scan) for the U.S. television and video/DVD/blu-ray releases.  It's a shame that the studio couldn't include both versions for this release, especially since most people have 16x9 televisions now so 4:3 is really obsolete.  At least 16:9 would be better than 4:3, although I'd really like to see this great looking and cinematic movie released in full widescreen (with letterboxing).",1355356800,9,1465,4.832

1- George C. Scott gives a magnificent performance as Scrooge, and I personally think it's his best role, ever (even better than Patton).
2- The move was filmed on location in Shrewsbury, an English town that stands in perfectly for early 19th century London. No movie set can even come close in comparison.

I know a lot of folks greatly enjoyed the more recent version with Patrick Stewart in the lead, yet I still believe that George C. Scott managed to bring a truer, more subtle, beautifully balanced portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge to the screen. I wouldn't have thought it possible with an American actor in the lead, but Scott delivers with all the power of his extraordinary talent.

A veritable constellation of great British character actors are in his orbit on this one. The most impressive performances are Edward Woodward, both jolly and scathing as the ghost of Christmas Present; and David Warner and Susannah York, entirely convincing and deeply poignant as the put-upon Cratchits. Roger Rees plays Fred Holywell with warmth and sincerity, and the wonderful Frank Finlay portrays the ghost of Jacob Marley on a par with Michael Hordern's 1951 version.

The set designs and filming locations in Shrewsbury add marvelous color to this movie; they beautifully set the tone of an Old English Christmas season. I agree that it is regrettable that the scenes of Scrooge witnessing the way Christmas is celebrated elsewhere in the world (aboard a ship at sea, for example) were trimmed out of the story, but I don't think in this case that it suffers that much with their loss.

Includes some additional footage during Scrooge's visit from the Ghost of Christmas Present.  This includes a displaced impoverished young family.  Living in a slum of London, it gives the wealthy Scrooge a view of the non-wealthy population of the industrial era.  A good film and I ernjoyed it.",1325635200,,529,5.188235294117647

726383,5,6303824358,"A Christmas Carol has been done to death on television, movies, comic books, animated and live features and on stage.  Many of them don't compare to the 1984 version with George C. Scott as the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge.

I'm sure you know the story so I'll tell the parts that really impressed.  The photography really brought forth the dark despair of Victorian England; the cold, snowy town with its darkness and deep shadow, yet children and adults grinning despite themselves because it's Christmas.

What is Christmas?  Is it a waste of time, just buying and spending?  The film shows Bob Crachitt, played expertly by David Warner (later doing an excellent acting job on the recent ""King's Speech"") who makes the best of what he has, and feels with his family and Tiny Tim, he's the luckiest man ever.

Scrooge's nephew, son of his sister.  I never seen other versions that really played up on the nephew Fred and his own struggle with Scrooge, the idea of Scrooge and gently correcting the less-than-complementary comments from his wife and friends about his miserly uncle.

The spirits are the usual three and jab Scrooge no end, throwing his own words back at him.  Not many versions show the Christmas Present spirit with the children named Ignorance and Want.  Shivers!

I think the best part is George C Scott's portrayal of Scrooge.  Too many actor's think they are the reason people are watching the story and they overplay the Scrooge role.

Top production values; superb casting; very dry and understated acting by Scott with wonderful supporting characters. At some point during the week before Christmas we put it on, (sometimes while decorating or wrapping presents, since we know it word for word), and it's just like the angel on the top of the tree.

  I've often thought Scott has not been accorded his due as an actor, (probably because of some of his hammier roles), but this is a restrained and deeply felt performance.

  Then again, the other part of our tradition is to watch Bill Murray's ""Scrooged"", so what do we know.",1322870400,6,733,4.6875

It got to the heart of how someone could end up like Scrooge without being overly melodramatic, but with substance that would pull at almost anyone's heartstrings and if you're a sensitive type, will make you shed a tear or two.

Though this portrayal is perhaps lesser known, it has to be attributed to lean marketing or something. George C Scott has a great grasp on every nuance in the Scrooge character arc and actually adds one or two new ones I haven't seen from anyone else. His Scrooge is scary, vile, menacing, insensitive, cynical, frightened out of his wits and genuinely, giddily transformed by the end. Everyone knows how the story goes, but George still manages to make the telling fresh. I'm sorry he's gone, but grateful he gave his portrayal to this timeless tale during his career. Oh, and the supporting characters in the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future all keep up in their own way...more than keep up, they deliver their own ribald, icy, sad, sarcastic and chilling portrayals in turn.

726567,5,6303824358,"Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol has been often told in film and live theater.  The film version starring George C. Scott is a traditional classic, sticking very closely to the Dickens original. Dickens describes Scrooge as ""a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly and his grating voice."" Scott manages to portray this Scrooge perfectly. In fact, it is amazing that he is able to make the transformation that Scrooge makes.

If you're looking for classic traditional version of the Christmas Carol, this is the one. The only better, perhaps, is to read the original, easily done in an evening, and best done adjoining a blazing fire.",1294790400,4,977,5.1

In this version, Scott is pretty good as Scrooge, but he's not the Scrooge that Dickens created.  It's hard to describe why he comes up short, but I think it has to do with his inability to create a Scrooge who's truly a lost case, truly past redemption, but who's redeemed anyway.  At times I feel that I'm watching an actor try to flesh out a character, and not watching the character himself.  It just doesn't work.  The casting is weak at best; Scrooge's nephew is completely unconvincing, and Tiny Tim delivers his lines like a kid hired to fill a role, not like a young actor who's good at what he does.

By far the worst part of the movie is the music.  It's loud and obnoxious, and completely over the top.  At times it's so unpleasant that it detracts from the movie, and that's not simply an effect they were trying to get.

Someday, someone may nail the character and make a version of this story that is worth watching over and over.  Until that day comes, this is a decent film, but definitely not an outstanding film.",1293667200,2,1196,4.271111111111111

The set design puts you in the mood for the holidays.  The actors who play all the supporting characters are wonderfully cast and provide a heartwarming interpretation of this classic.  For a made for TV movie, it excels in its quality and consistency.  George C. Scott cannot give a bad performance, and his subtle sometimes quiet demeanor on some of the classic lines makes it sound like he is speaking extemporaneously.  Yet, he is able to portray joy, anger, tearful sadness and remorse with the same credibility.  I only wish this had been filmed in a wide screen format, but many classics are not, so I suppose it doesn't matter. I orginally recorded this off TV onto VHS back in the 80's and winced only at the poor quality.  When it came out in VHS, I bought it immediately and when it came out in DVD, I bought it again.

726686,5,6303824358,"Most of the time film writers like to reference the 1951 Christmas Carol of Alastair Sim as the best ever; and it is very fine indeed, no doubt. But I'd urge anyone in the market for a Christmas Carol to watch at home this holiday season to give George C. Scott a try. No other Carol that I've ever seen so captures what Britain in the 1830s must have been like--dark, smoggy, cold, a harsh place. It truly conveys the spirit of Dickens' world. And no one has ever captured Scrooge's transformation so vividly as Scott. Even without a proper British accent, he goes from dark to light, from misanthrope to humanitarian, in a wonderfully shaded performance. His nasty Scrooge at the outset is very credible, because Scott himself was an irascible character and knew ""cranky"" first hand. (An acquaintance of a friend of mine played a role in this 1984 made for TV movie and commented that Scott was not easy or pleasant to work with.) His Scrooge at the end has blossomed like a flower, because Scott was simply one of the great actors of his generation. And there's a great supporting cast, too: David Warner, Susannah York, Roger Rees, Angela Pleasance (Donald's daughter), Edward Woodward. This is the Christmas Carol that my wife & I try to watch every holiday season, and I'd urge you to make it a tradition, as well. P.S. This is written several years after my original review and I have just obtained the Blu Ray version. As much as I love the film, the old DVD was muddy and fuzzy and poorly transferred.

Much of the costuming and sets are based on the illustrations from the first edition, and are so amazingly accurate to the period that I feel transported to another place and another time.  For my family, Christmas is not Christmas without watching George C. Scott in A Christmas Carol.

726690,5,6303824358,"I think this is the best version of a Christmas Carol, although I will concede that the Alistair Sim version is also first rate.  George C. Scott is simply superb and makes Scrooge's transformation quite plausible.  The cast of British actors is also uniformly excellent and the English village used in the filming also makes a great stand-in for early Victorian London.  The atmosphere simply can't be beat.  As other reviewers have noted, it's difficult to believe that this is a made-for television movie.  I think it might well have been a success if it had been released theatrically.

I have to admit to being a bit disappointed in the Blu-ray version, which I bought to replace my DVD copy (which, in turn, had been bought to replace my old VHS tape).  The transfer is ok, but there wasn't a noticeable increase in picture quality from the DVD version.  In addition, as the film was made for television, the image doesn't fit the dimensions of modern hi-def televisions, leaving black bars to the right and left of the picture.  I was also disappointed that there were absolutely no extras.  It would have been interesting to have seen a discussion of the making of the film -- I have a dim recollection of an interesting article in TV Guide about the film at the time of its first broadcast.  I realize that television productions don't typically have people trailing along filming interviews and shots of the production process the way that theatrical films do.  Still, Fox could at least have hired someone to do a commentary track.  The packaging is also a bit flimsy.  It is the ""soft case"" type of Blu-ray packaging and there were actually some scratches on the disc as a result.  I was afraid it might not play properly, although it did.  All in all, particularly given the high price (at least it's rather high as I write this review in December 2010), I would have to say that this Blu-ray version is disappointing.  Even if you are as big a fan of the film as I am, you might want to stick with the DVD version.

Finally, a few fun things:  There was an article in the New York Times last year about the original manuscript of a Christmas Carol, which is now held in the Morgan Library.  Apparently, Dickens initial name for Tiny Tim was Little Fred!  Thank goodness he made that change.  Is the Spirit of Christmas Present actually the Spirit of Christmas Near Future?  After all, the Spirit doesn't show Scrooge around London at the time of the Spirit's arrival (2 a.m.).  He takes Scrooge to see the Cratchits eating Christmas Dinner around noon and then to his nephew's house also around noon.  Only the final scene under the bridge might plausibly be 2 a.m.  Nitpicking, of course, but that's always bothered me.  I saw an article recently about the evolution of Christmas as a holiday.  The article mentioned that in the nineteenth century in both England and the United States, many people worked on Christmas day.  In fact, when the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge through the city, they encounter many stores open -- including the one where Scrooge buys the turkey for the Cratchits.  This makes Scrooge's negative reaction to Bob Cratchit taking Christmas as a paid holiday a little less, well, Scrooge-like.  It wasn't universal practice to give Christmas as a paid holiday and Scrooge was being at least a little generous in doing so.",1292803200,4,3373,4.704778156996587

I'll also add, too, that I was very pleasantly surprised with the picture quality of the Blu-Ray edition. Between it being more than 25 years old and having been a made-for-television movie I wasn't expecting much but in fact the picture quality was very good even sitting fairly close to a 55-inch Sony Bravia.",1292630400,3,656,4.615384615384615
726692,5,6303824358,"Every year I watch the 20 or so movies I associate with Christmas.  Though not all are actually about the holiday or its origin, they all have something to do with the feelings and meaning attached to it.

One of the most important stories about Christmas, and the one that is most often credited with shaping it for modern society is Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""  There are several versions of it, all to a greater or lesser degree faithful to the original tale, and I enjoy many of them, each for what it has to offer.

This is one of my favorites, largely because it is an acting tour de force.  Scott shines as Scrooge at each and every stage of his development.  This rendition better than any other captures the reality of a human being so damaged by his experiences that he is utterly committed to avarice and so afraid of human involvement that he is already dead, inside if not outside.  This is a real person with real problems, not a cartoon cut out.  As with good narrative of any kind, the viewer is allowed to form his or her own opinions of the character of Srcooge, and like the character himself grow and change in outlook.  We don't so much identify with him as change our understanding of him, until we come to feel compassion for his experiences as a child and young adult and for the personal losses he inflicted upon himself.  In short we ourselves grow.  If we see ourselves in him at all, it is in these self inflicted emotional wounds.  Either we know ourselves to have been guilty of complicity in our own episodes of personal unhappiness, or we can say to ourselves, ""There but for the grace of God might I also be.""

Like the other cinematic versions of the story, this one also presents the usual costume and pageantry of the 19th century venue of the original story.  The sense of ""being there"" in London and its environs and of taking part in the intimate settings of private homes, makes this film version far more real than others.  Most of the others have a more staged character that partakes more of the theater experience than of a life experience.  Here the color and attention to scenic detail, the intimacy of the camera angles and sound effects all go far to create a sense not only of time but of space.  All of this evokes emotional responses that keep the viewer engaged throughout; not an entirely easy feat given the general familiarity of the story.

For fun examples of other remakes, I suggest:  the 1951 black and white version with Alistair Sim&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol-Ultimate-Collector-s-Edition-B-W-Color/dp/B000SR0DDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol (Ultimate Collector's Edition)(B/W & Color)</a>, the musical/animation version by the Muppet Theater&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Muppet-Christmas-Carol-Kermit-s-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000ATQYT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition</a>, the musical version with Albert Finney&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrooge/dp/B0000AQS5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrooge</a>.

726779,5,6303824358,"To offer a fresh take on one of the most well known tales ever told, one had better have a solid leading man, and one had better be prepared to inject something new or invigorating into the story. Fortunately for this 1984 adaptation of A Christmas Carol, casting George C. Scott as Scrooge and adapting the script accordingly proved not only to work, but also to elevate the nearly irreproachable source material.

It's a tall order to improve upon a story powerful enough to intrigue scores of children even from non-English speaking countries, but Scott and Co. do this with aplomb. What's to add to the grumpy old man, Jacob Marley and the three spirits, the playback of a life and prophecy of impending doom, and the regeneration that follows? George got it right: Scrooge shouldn't be just a grumpy old man - there are scores of grumpy old men all around us; what makes old Ebenezer worthy of this supernatural intervention? - he should be downright evil.

The mote of a problem with Dickens' novel is, quite simply, that Scrooge caves in too quickly. Some memories Christmas Past throws back in his face turn him back into clay most pliant, and we see his road to repentance a little too clearly and a little too quickly. One-hundred forty one years later a film's cast and crew show undeniable evidence - not to mention courage - of seeing this problem clearly and correcting it, while still relaying the calculated sentimentality so palpable in the novel.

Here, Scrooge isn't just cantankerous; he is icy and utterly immovable, and just plain mean. Most of the extra-biblical dialogue works to the betterment of the story. There's a scene early on when Scrooge visits the `change, and gouges some buyers into buying corn at an exorbitant price. Coming on the heels of his departure from his office where he complained to his employee of having to pay him ""so handsomely,"" the message here seems to be that there's a little bit of hypocrisy lurking not just in Scrooge, but in all of us.

This new approach to Scrooge required alterations in the other roles also, most notably the spirits, who must be rougher than we've seen before. Edward Woodward as Christmas Present is grandiose, overwrought, and brilliant. The famous speech about ignorance and want, instead of a well-worded but faintly mealy-mouthed entreaty, scans as a death sentence, which is exactly how Dickens intended it to be.

To say the least, the happy denouement is as convincing as Scrooge in his most errant state. The transformation wrought upon Scrooge is completely rewarding to the viewer, due to the many good choices made throughout the film. The acting is good all around, but this is clearly Scott's film.

726782,5,6303824358,"How many times have you read that somebody thinks the Blu-Ray version of an old movie isn't worth spit? Why some people have issues with Blu-Ray releases I feel can be usually found in the tools they use to view the movie. Subpar Blu-Ray players hooked up to mediocre TVs, with sound being heard through tinny speakers will always result in a less than steller viewing experience. Maybe the system they are using hasn't been optimized. Perhaps adjustments to color, contrast, brightness, and sound, which are necessary to let the quality of the Blu-Ray shine through, have been ignored. The quality of a Blu-Ray isn't always in the eye of the beholder if that beholder has no idea how to optimize the system the movie is playing through. Not all Blu-Ray upgrades are good- but on the whole, they are a definite improvement over upconverted DVD.

I apologize for the rant. My review:

  I've been watching this movie ever since it aired way back in 1984(?). The quality of the acting, production values, direction and the overall spirit of the film are legend. George C. Scott lives and breathes Scrooge. The rest of the actors are just as strong. If you've seen the movie you probably agree. The last disc version I have before this was DVD. The picture was fine on my old 36"" tube set but on a 50"" Panasonic, upconverted through a Panasonic Blu-ray player it struggled to have depth. The sound was so-so ( afterall this was a movie made for TV ) but the production quality and the spirit of the show managed to overcome these visual and sonic shortcomings.

  I watched the Blu-Ray version of this movie for the first time last night and was impressed. Here was an upgrade to Blu-Ray that clarified everything about this old stalwart. The color, contrast, sharpness and especially the sound ( now in 7.1 DTS-HD ) were all greatly improved. I've seen older movies where going to Blu-Ray resulted in graininess and distorted memory colors ( flesh tones, hair color, forest green ) but not with this Blu-ray. The close-up skin tones are smooth, fleshy and totally devoid of grain. The subdued colors of Scrooge's bedroom and his workplace are just that- suddued. There are also scenes when the sharpness and depth of contrast are startling ( when Scrooge is transported  back to his school days and his father arrives to take him home the scene almost has a 3D quality about it). Even though presented in 1.33:1 full screen ( old TV ratio ) the movie never seems hemmed-in or held back from being grand in scope.

  I don't like long-winded reviews so I'll just finish by saying, in my opinion, this is a quality, all-to-gether enjoyable upgraded rendition of a true classic. The improvements in appearance, sound and nuance mark it as a well-handled worthwhile Blu-Ray release. This version will make you sit up and become even more aware of just how much of a timeless masterpiece this production truly is.

If you enjoyed this movie in DVD this new Blu-Ray is worth every penny as an upgrade into the realm of HD. It will keep you entertained for many years to come (that is, of course, until the 3D version comes along ;-).",1292284800,21,3125,4.672131147540983

All the actors are great in their roles and the Ghost of Christmas Future is about as scary as it gets.

George C Scott manages to inject humor into spots in the movie which are pricless.  No one does it better.  I had it on video but recently have been unable to use my video player due to the new digital cable, so had to buy the DVD so I could watch it several times before Christmas.

However, if you want to see one that is the closest to the original book, then this is the one you for you. This version, starring George C.

Other scenes have minor alterations or additions and a few short scenes have been added. But for the most part, the movie plays like the book.

The acting is top notch. Marley's Ghost is simply the best ever done. David Warner as Cratchit does a wonderful job. Even Edward Woodward gives the Ghost of Christmas Present the appropriate twinkle.

I have seen almost all of the adaptations (no thank you, Jim Carrey) and have enjoyed some (Scrooge) and disliked others (Reginald Owen) but this one has become my standard Christmas tradition. My wife and I watch it every year without fail, every Christmas Eve.

My only knock against this release is the total lack of special features. As a huge fan of this version I'd love some behind-the-scenes stuff or interviews. Even TV spots... anything. Instead I've got the companion book from 25 years ago and that's about it.

  George C. Scott owns the role of Scrooge. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost of Christmas Present ever filmed (he has the BEST laugh I've ever heard), and it is a joy to watch these two old warhorses pull together.

726864,5,6303824358,"Deep reverence to Alastair Sim, and yes, I said it, Michael Caine (""The Muppet Christmas Carol""), but George C. Scott hits this one out of the park. This brilliant adaptation of the Dickens' classic is a legacy in my home during Christmastime. My family and I have been watching this version since the 80's. Scott's performance, despite lacking a ""proper British accent"" (I would describe it as somewhere between ""very light British"" and ""very precise American""), is in a word, perfect. Even without the flasbacks to his youth, we easily infer that Scrooge's past was filled with much pain and turbulence. Scott's nuanced performance is all we require to fully understand that past traumatic experiences had a profound and lasting effect on old Ebenezer, making his ultimate transformation that much more triumphant. Moreover, one needs to look no further than the front cover of the current Blu-Ray edition to recognize Scrooge's pain, sadness and fear so effectively displayed on Scott's face. Only a great actor can say so much within the limitations of mere facial expression.
  The cast is top-shelf throughout. Frank Finlay's Marley's Ghost resonates the pivotal phrase ""Mankind was my Business"", Edward Woodward shines as the hearty, compassionate, and, at times, necessarily snarky Ghost of Christmas Present, David Warner's Bob Cratchit beautifully exemplifies both love for his family and the grave sadness as to the loss of his youngest child, all the while trying not to reveal his pain to them, and Roger Rees, playing Scrooge's nephew, is remembered (in a role that usually isn't) as a young man whose grace and wisdom far exeed his years.
  Great music, production values and direction combine to make this adaptation a most perfect small screen project. Now that a Blu-Ray edition is on it's way, one has no excuse but to purchase this immediately.

726867,5,6303824358,"I loved George C. Scott's version of Scrooge. I grew up with the 1938 version, and I still like it, but I like this one better.

Usually, the depiction of Scrooge is as a feisty, mean, old man, one who can intimidate and scare people as he comes there way. Scott portrayed him as a cold businessman, an Ebeneezer Scrooge that was more business than he was hot-tempered and mean. His coldness of heart evenutally transforms, but the change is believable. Scrooge still has the same temperment, but he is a much more compasionate man.

I also liked Jacob Marley's ghost. This Jacob Marley truly is a ghost you can believe has been cast into the depths of hell. His ghost was deeply tormented and had much remorse and regret for the selfish life he lived of hoarding money for selfish ain and greed. A great performance that deserves recognition. The 1938 version of Jacob Marley cannot compare.

George C. Scott makes Ebenezer Scrooge work as a real person in this incredible production.  He delivers a performance that is intelligent, dry and humane.  Realism is also a calling card of this stellar performance.  A common problem with adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"" is that the actors playing Scrooge read their lines as if they had Dickens' novel open offstage, and are giving a well-thought recitation rather than a full-bodied performance.  Alistair Sim's film even suffers from this method.

Thirteen years before he had a bit part as Cal Hockley's manservant Lovejoy in ""Titanic"", David Warner portrayed Bob Cratchit in this movie, and infuses him with a realistic warmth and the glimmer of a good man.  He sidesteps the temptation to turn Cratchit into a grinning, impossibly joyous caricature and gives a memorable counterpoint to Scott's icy Scrooge.

Frank Finlay is as irreplaceable as Jacob Marley as George C. Scott is as Ebenezzer Scrooge.  He arrests the film for the short time he is onscreen, and plays the ghost with an anguish and fearlessness that shames every other iteration of Marley I've seen.

In a small part, Susannah York brings the most humanity to her portrayal of Mrs. Cratchit than any other actress to play the character.  She is believable as a kind, caring mother and plays her indignation and anger at having to toast Scrooge very realistically.

Awesome, realistic performances dominate this finest of all film adaptations of Dickens' classic holiday story, and at the head of the cast George C. Scott recreates Scrooge for modern sensibilities in a timeless performance.",1262476800,4,1633,5.120754716981132

He is my favorite Scrooge(and I have seen the Albert Finney and Alstair Sim versions). I admit his lack of a convincing british accent is annoying at times and Angela Pleasence disappoints me as Christmas Past. What I love most about this movie is the chill factor. This is the only film to capitilize on the genuine chill of the novel. The dark streets, the hearse carriage, the lightning when Christmas Yet to Come is on screen and the bony finger pointing the way. As a whole, the Patrick Stewart version is the best and most faithful to the story, but George C. Scott is Scrooge all the way! A note to previous poster's, this version comes on tv every year.

Scott) always would rob the widows and swindle the poor as he hates christmas since he was young. His worker Bob Cratchit (David Warner) is a family man with a beautiful wife (Susanne York), a sickly crippled boy named Tiny Tim (Anthony Walters) and a loving family that he's trying to provide yet he's quite underpaid by his greedy boss. Later on he is haunted by the spirit of former partner Jacob Marley (Frank Finlay) as he warns him that he spent his life of greed with no joy for christmas or any human being leaving him in chains to be doomed and the same thing will happen to Scrooge if doesn't change his ways. Three spirits of past, Present and Future (Angeleca Pleasance, Edward Woodard and Michael Carter) pay a visit to see him as they will change his life and make him appreciate christmas.

One of the better adaptations of the immortal and timeless Dickens classic! George Scott is wonderfully casted as the main character who portrays a nastiness in the character and the other actors who played the other characters. The special effects in this production aren't too bad for a wonderful christmas feature that shows us the meaning of Christmas including being unloved yet you can believe it.

727076,5,6303824358,"When I was a kid... this was the FIRST Christmas Carol Adaptation I have ever seen... and everyone that I have tried to watch ranging from the classic, musical, new age, even muppets, just doesn't measure up to the dramatic mastery of George C. Scott and the fine ensemble that follows his lead; David Warner doesn't get enough credit for his portrayal of Bob (if you aren't crying by the time his recites his graveyard visit/run with Ned... you have no soul).

I think one of the enduring things about this masterpiece is the cinematography, by accident.  It was shot with a type of film that brings you that organic feeling that ""old school"" studio era films brought, yet with subtle clarity of the best film negative possible of the day, and today... it makes it seem like a gorgeous colorful artwork capturing the luster only a history book of the time can compare to (film students should study this film).
The accident is that the director/editor chose shots and angles and used snow to white balance almost everything outdoors, which is why the progression of spirits are so stark, yet fade into darkness, startling us under the bridge at the end of Christmas presents' tour.
If you were to shoot this today (in digital video) it would look like crap... right place and right time.

Sound was always good, dialogue over music and effects... and the street choirs pierce right though your ear and always leave my jaws dropped.  The score, timed perfectly.  Costumes make Titanic almost a joke in historical accuracy. Special effects.... for the day it worked wonderfully... still does in many ways.

My only complaint is the QUALITY OF SOUND, DATED SPECIAL EFFECTS, AND ASPECT RATIO OF THE MOVIE, and REEL AGE.
Quality of sound... it needs to be remastered to High Def, and if the music cannot be salvaged, re-score it like you did with Star Trek (might even haunt us more if needed).
Dated special effects... for the day dissolves worked for Marley... do something else.
The original aspect ratio... is 1:85... which would fill HDTV screens perfectly... especially if you were to:
RELEASE IT ON BLU RAY!!!  The reel age has me concerned.. and needs to be salvaged and cleaned.  This movie was not cleaned before DVD release... shame on you Fox.

You also missed a golden opportunity releasing it on Blu Ray this year... the 25th Anniversary was 6 days ago...

727077,2,6303824358,"According to most people I have spoken with, the 1984 George C. Scott version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is most people's favorite.  I remember seeing it as a kid when it first aired on television.  I probably watched it a couple more times while growing up.  I saw it again about 5 years ago, and most recently, about a week ago.  Having read the book three or four times and watched numerous other performances, I have to say the George C. Scott's performance - though a worthy attempt - does not measure up to how Scrooge should be portrayed on screen.

One point that this version did hit upon much better than any other verison I have ever seen was the role of Tiny Tim.  In this version, he actually looks (in the face) like a very sick child.  Other versions simply portray him as an otherwise healthy kid who for whatever reason gets around on a crutch (or on his father's shoulder).

While it's true that every big and small screen version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL has taken it's own share of ""artistic liberties,"" the George C. Scott version not only follows the book pretty well in terms of story but gives the viewer an authentic glimpse of Victorian London in December as well as a peek into what was probably Ebenezer Scrooge's everyday life.  That aside, there is one or two glaring problems with this version.

On one hand, although the morals in A CHRISTMAS CAROL are universal, one must remember that this is a very English story, and therefore Scrooge should either be played by an Englishman or at least by someone who can speak convincingly with an English accent.  Throughout most of this picture, George C. Scott does not seem to even put forth the effort to use an English accent.

George C. Scott's Scrooge was a miser with a wry smile and an unattractive sense of humor.  While words like ""miser,"" ""wry,"" and ""unattractive"" are all fair descriptions of how Scrooge should be portrayed, the novel's description as well as that of most of the other film versions leave no place for any kind of a smile or sense of humor.

George C. Scott looked like someone that it would have been easy to reform.  A proper portrayal of the unreformed Scrooge would show a man so disgusting in nature, so evil-looking that reform and redemption would seem impossible.  And the reformed Scrooge would look, at first glance, like a man who must have had some hard, terrible past.  (I think the Albert Finney version fulfills these two characteristics better than any other.)",1260835200,7,2470,4.602739726027397

It has become a family tradition to watch this movie at least once around Christmas time.  George C. Scott gives a stentorian performance as Scrooge, and Jacob Marley, the ghost who comes to foretell him of the visits (""one at when the clock falls at one, another when the clock falls at two, and the third in his own good time!"") is equally impressive.  As this was filmed in Shrewsbury, England, the period and settings are realistic to the time Dickens wrote this story.  My kids especially enjoyed the food market scenes and I had to explain to them 170 years ago, people did not have the choice of just going down to the supermarket and picking out a frozen turkey for their holiday dinner.  They had to pluck it and clean it and dress it and then cook over a fire.

Scott, best known for his Oscar-winning performace in Patton.  He plays the character so well that I'm sure Dickens would have hand-picked himself.  From the Scrooge in the beginning into the friendly soul in the end, Scott performs with extraordinary skill.  David Warner, who plays Bob Crachit, also puts in a fine performance, even though I'm used to seeing him play a villan.  If you are unsure about which version of ""A Christmas Carol"" to see, choose this version as you will be blown away.

727136,5,6303824358,"Well, almost the end.

I have seen every version there is and am delighted to report that this particular one stands head and shoulders above all the rest, for all the reasons elsewhere herein articulated. I would add that the remarks about George C. Scott supposedly ""overacting"" produced a wide grin of bemusement; for a true example of overacting the role of Ebenezer Scrooge--even whilst being remarkably reined in--see Carrey, first name Jim. (One of my favorite comic actors of all time but utterly and embarrassingly miscast for this role. He never says ""bah"" or ""humbug"" one time either, which itself is a humbug, almost sacrilege for A Christmas Carol. Sorry, Jim. >:^D)

There is no hyperbole in stating that George C. Scott was arguably one of the best if not the best actor of our age. Mr. Scott yet stands as the sine qua non of the dramatic art and the standard against which nearly all others may be judged (IMHO, though I clearly am not alone in this assessment). He embodies and then conveys the ""spirit"" of his characters as well as anyone could imagine it being done, and none moreso than his elaborately nuanced depiction of the miserly Scrooge. All the other actors in the film, as well as the set designers, costumers and directors, do their jobs convincingly enough that we find ourselves completely enmeshed in the picture, almost as if it WERE 3-D--only minus the clumsy glasses and without all the characters' skin resembling latex rubber.

This has to be one of the all-time quality champions of low-budget filmmaking. So well done is it that a heart as cold and hard as Scrooge's must beat in the chest of any not moved to at least one tear whilst watching this glorious treasure. It has definitely become a cherished part of our holiday season, as our family curls up in delicious anticipation with the hot chocolate beside a crackling fire every Christmas Eve without fail to revel in this story's transcendent message and in the majesty of a cinematic masterwork.

727140,5,6303824358,"With Christmas on the way, I just wanted to add my two cents on some of my favorite Christmas movies.  This adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" is the best one I've viewed so far.  Not only is George C. Scott wonderful as Scrooge, but the film contains great performances by others in the cast as well.

I love the look of the film, the costuming, and the period appropriate music.  I liked how this film fleshed out several of the ""background"" characters - ""old Fezziwig"", Fred (Scrooge'e nephew), Belle (the lost love of Scrooge) - even the main character of the ""Ghost of Christmas Present"" is given much more depth.  I especially enjoy some of the humor of the story (at Scrooge's expense) that is seldom brought out in previous films - such as the ""Christmas Dinner"" scene in the Cratchit home while Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Present are looking on.  The interplay between Scrooge and the Ghost is quite humorous during this scene.

The ""party scene"" in Scrooge's nephew's home is quite entertaining as well.

As someone else has said, this film has become a part of their Christmas season celebration.  I would agree with that for me as well.  If you've never seen it - get it and watch it with your Christmas tree shining brightly in the corner and bucket of popcorn and your favorite drink.  You'll experience a wonderful Christmas treat if you do.  Merry Christmas!",1255737600,,1381,4.661157024793388

As a result, when they get to the end of the story, they look more crazy than filled with joy. Believe it or not, Scrooge is one of Dickens more humorous characters. I defy you to say in you mind ""Any fool that goes around with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of Holly though his heart"" and not see the dark humor in it. And how many of us would be able to stand in front of a ghost and say ""There's more gravy than grave about you"". Scott even manages to make ""Bah, Humbug"" into something at least Simi-humorous. As a result of his not being a just plain mean person, the redemption scene is believably. The movie also includes some favorites generally missed. Jacob Marlays jaw dropping and the two children want and ignorance.",1230163200,3,1029,4.4787234042553195

One thing Britishers Stewart and Alistair Sim, who did an excellent job in the 1951 film version, provide the American Scott does not is an English accent, but Scott's naturally gruff voice more than compensates and suits the part well.

Despite the fact that this was made for TV in 1984 it is extremely well done. Then again, made-for-TV movies in the late 70s and early 80s often had excellent casts and good production. Apparently this version was filmed completely in Shrewsbury, England. Great care was taken to make each scene look authentic. Even though George C. Scott does not have much of an English accent he is quickly forgiven for his brilliant performance. This Christmas Carol is darker and more serious than other interpretations and George C. Scott's scrooge is very cruel and truly on his way to eternal damnation. Every person in this film is a real character with dialogue and not just some warm body on the set. The scenes at Tiny Tim's home with the family are especially moving to me. The ghost of Christmas-present uses Scrooge's own words against him quite trenchantly. I have watched this gem a couple times every year for the last two decades. It gives us all hope that people can change at any age in life and help make the world a better place.

The star: George C. Scott was an icon; legendary American stage and film actor, director, and producer, perhaps best known for his Academy Award-winning portrayal of General George S. Patton Jr. in the film Patton.  He was, quite simply, one of the finest actors of his (or any other) generation.  An actor who often played gruff and harsh roles, Scott was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor for his portrayal in A Christmas Carol.

Scott's interpretation of Scrooge is spot-on.  His Scrooge is a complex human being and as the story unfolds the viewer sees WHY he became so bitter and cynical in his old age, and for (perhaps) the first time an actor playing Scrooge successfully portrays the REGRETS the character has.  His Scrooge feels REAL.  He takes familiar dialogue and makes it seem spontaneous and fresh.  He face, his movements, his words, all convey the emotion the man feels - and he does feel.  His ultimate transformation seems believable: This is a man who has closed his heart to love to feeling, and finally realizes what he's lost.  Scott is brilliant as Scrooge.

Ebenezer Scrooge: [Sitting under the bridge after the Ghost of Christmas Present leaves] ""What have I done... to be abandoned like this? What?""

The Cast: The entire cast is wonderful.  No role is miscast.  In addition, many of the actors are British, so the mannerisms and accents and use of language seem natural.  The acting is believable, making characters in an all-too familiar story seem REAL and full of life.

David Warner's Bob plays just the right balance of timid clerk and loving husband/father.  Susanna York (who will always be ""Lara"" to me), is pitch-perfect as Mrs. Cratchit.  There's a nice scene where Bob Cratchit and his wife kiss under the mistletoe and hug lovingly.  This version shows that that are not just parents but a couple who love each other very much.

The Cratchit children are not overly sugary but just seem like nice kids.  I like when Mrs. Cratchit tells one of the children to go butter the brad and she adds, ""Thinly.""  Tiny Tim is sickly looking, but not overplayed as the over-the-top doomed child.

Roger Rees as Fred is very good, and the casting directors actually made an effort to cast Scrooge's sister Fan and Fred resembling each other.  Rees's Fred is just a little too reserved for me, but that may be a directorial choice to contrast him with his Uncle Ebenezer.

Frank Finlay (Marley's Ghost), performance is incredible; you really believe he is filled with regret for his lot.  Finlay plays the role as just a bit crazy, just a bit over the top emotional; which is perfect for Jacob Marley.

The Ghost of Christmas past is wonderful; Angela Pleasence conveys just the right balance of teacher/reminder and clear contempt for Ebenezer.  What's interesting in this version is that the ghosts have obvious disdain for Scrooge - and aren't afraid to show it.  When Christmas Past is departing as Scrooge insanely screams, ""Leave me,"" she smiles wickedly.  But she also prods him, sometimes gently:

[Christmas past and Scrooge are watching his past self dance with his great love, Belle:]
Christmas Past: ""How long since you danced, Ebenezer?""
Scrooge: ""Waste of time.""
Christmas Past: ""You didn't think so then.""
Scrooge: ""The was a REASON then.""

GREAT writing.  GREAT characterization.  Honest regret over choices made and not made.

Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present is exceptional.  He is full of life and humor, sarcastic when he needs to be, and he also doesn't hide his disapproval of Scrooge.  He is bombastic at times, commanding, powerful, and a man (ghost) on a mission.  He is enjoying his torment of Scrooge.  I get the feeling he really doesn't care whether Scrooge repents or not.

[Scrooge, observing the Cratchit's meal:]
Scrooge: ""It's a very small goose.""
Christmas Present: ""It's all Bob Cratchit can afford.""

And when the ghost reminds Scrooge of his ""decrease the surplus population"" comment he is positively venomous as he snarls, """"It may be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child!""  It's familiar dialogue but man, this ghost is seething when he says it.

Throughout the film, many of the actors communicate with facial expressions rather than words.  A good actor can pull this off brilliantly.  There are many such examples in this film: Scrooge's look of confusion when he sees Marley.  Young Ebenezer's look of sadness and regret when he knows he'll never please his father.  And so much more.

The film itself:

Thee entire movie is VERY faithful to the original story.  It was filmed on location in Shrewsbury, England, giving it an authenticity not found in other adaptations.  The costumes are perfect.  The attention to detail is meticulous.  Nothing looks like a ""set,""  All the places - the homes, the markets, the offices, look real.  The scenes of commerce at the exchange, the frenzied shopping at the market on Christmas morning, the bustling city - it looks and sounds very real.

The foggy, dreary London described in the Dickens story is very well created here.  The streets where Scrooge walks to his home are dark and creepy.

The majority of the special effects are conveyed by traditional stage effects with smoke, and lighting.  It's all very effective.

The scene at the when the horses and Marley's funeral carriage pass by - we see it but Scrooge doesn't - creepy.

Marley's makeup, lighting and clothing -- all a deathly blue - is well done.

The transitions from one scene to the next during the time-travel are unique to each ghost - the cap Christmas Past holds reflects each scene as we transition from one time to the next.  Christmas Present's torch bridges one sequence to the next scene, and Christmas future transitions each scene with a loud crash and brilliant flash of lightning.

And in each of Scrooge's visions of the future, after he witnesses the scene the lights dim and only a spotlight effect remains on him - almost like standing alone on a stage.  It's a very effective presentation.  The Ghost of Christmas yet to come first appears as spotlight shines on him in the distance, and it is conveyed mostly through shadows of hands and hoods.  It's all very well done.

Liberties with the story (all good):

As Scrooge takes his cold gruel by the unlit fireplace, he sniffles, a reminder that (in the story) Scrooge had a head cold.

I love it when Scrooge adds his own ""Amen"" to the Cratchit's Christmas prayer.

We see several scenes of Scrooge conducting his commodity trading business at the exchange.  Scrooge is clearly recognized as a man of business and is deferred to as such, but a hard businessman with no compassion or room for negotiation.

The Ghost of Christmas present doesn't age and fade away in this version - he laughs at Scrooge and abandons him outside in unknown territory.

We finally meet Scrooge's father in this version - he's a cold man, a mean spirited old bastard.  He does not love his son -We learn that Scrooge's mother died giving birth to him and Silus Scrooge holds a grudge against his son because of it.  This makes the characters seem much more real.  Also, I think this is one of the few versions where Fan is older than Ebenezer.

There are dozens upon dozens of memorable scenes in this film, but my favorite is the end -- in this version, it's clear that Scrooge is a man whose newfound joy is tempered by remorse.  Not only is his intention to make things right in the present and future, but to apologize for his past behaviors. His apology to his nephew is here an integral part of the story--it is heartfelt.  And it works.

Scrooge: ""Well, I've come for three reasons.  The first is to beg your pardon.  [What I said about Christmas] THAT was a humbug, Fred.""

He goes on to meet Fred's wife Janet and says, ""I, uh, I was in love once.  Can you believe that?""

Janet: ""Yes.""

Scrooge: ""But I had neither the courage nor the conviction that you two share.""

He then reminds Fred how much he resembles his sister Fan and adds, ""I loved your mother, Fred.  For a time I'd forgotten how much.""

And finally Scrooge says, ""My God forgive me for the time I've wasted.""

Summary: An outstanding adaptation of the story with a perfect cast, believable, flesh and blood characters and meticulously detailed sets and streets.  A perfect Scrooge and a larger-than-life stage, an adapt ion that takes a very familiar story and makes it feel fresh, and real.

While I enjoy the other film versions, this one is head and shoulders above them all. The others all have the unmistakable look and feel of being filmed on a studio sound set and are often too stagey looking.

727407,3,6303824358,"Everyone has their favorite version for various reasons. I like this version and watch it every Christmas, but I can't get past George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge. 'A Christmas Carol' is of course an English story; more specifically a London story, and hearing Scott, an American, attempting an English accent while the other actors speak authentically, causes me to scowl a little. Also, I have a hard time believing George C. Scott's Scrooge as being truly repentant. He appears to be immovable, hard and crusty even late in the interactions with the Spirits; I believe that Dicken's Scrooge would have softened considerably by the time the Ghost of Christmas Future arrives. So, only after seeing his tombstone, he supposedly breaks. Thus, on Christmas morning, for me there's not enough of a transition when he all of a sudden laughs and smiles. Scrooge's character, I think, would have been a softy who through the years of rejection by his father and pursuit of wealth would have hardened and with having his life displayed in front of him would soften. Scott's Scrooge for me never completely softens. Also, I'm a bit disappointed with Roger Rees' performance of Fred Holywell. Dickens' Holywell is jovial and light hearted (like mother Fan). Rees' Holywell is deadpan and melancholy. In my opinion, the best performance of Fred is Dominic West in Patrick Stewart's version. Having said this, the photography and effects are wonderful and the music and scenes filmed in Shrewsbury, England give this film a very Dickensian flavor. I'll continue to watch and love this version. But, in my opinion, it's not the best!",1196208000,7,1628,5.033333333333333

George C. Scott plays the bitter and ultra stingy Ebenezer Scrooge to perfection. As does his co-star David Warner, who takes the part of Bob Cratchit, and makes it his own.  From the visually thrilling visit from Scrooge's former co-worker and business partner, Jacob Marley (Frank Finlay) to the haunting visits from the Ghosts of Christmas past (Angela Pleasence), present (Edward Woodward), and future (Michael Carter) each scene and performance is wonderfully done!  Another outstanding performance is by Roger rees, who plays Scrogge's nephew, Fred. He also narrates the story very well, and you get a better feel for the time and era that the events play out, for the music and sets are extremely well done!  The dvd itself has a good print and the color and sound are very good, as well. I highly recommend adding this 1984 Made-For-TV movie of ""A Christmas Carol"" to your dvd library!

In fact, the whole movie was well done except for the character of Scrooge.  I know other people have reviewed this remake and raved about Scott's performance, but I thought it was unbelievably bad.  He was creepy, hissed all of his lines in the same, flat monotone (with a plastered-on malicious smile), and not at any time in the movie, lovable or even understandable as your basic, hard-to-like curmudgeony grump. There's a fine line between the Dickens Scrooge and the one invented by Scott, and the one Scott chose to portray goes too far.  Instead of being bitter, he came off as murderously psycho, and instead of being terminally grouchy, he just about imitated a serial killer.  I did not think his famous reformation at the end of the movie was believable at all.

The supporting cast was all right, but some of the scenes seemed cheesy or forced.  The punk Ghost of Christmas present kind of threw me off.

727559,5,6303824358,"George C. Scott has created a slightly different variation on Scrooge. Even though most of the dialogue was familiar, in this version they always seemed to err on the side of less. Instead of running some of the familiar lines from the book they used either facial expressions and actions or just moved on with the story. These choices made for a much more powerful experience for me. I can see now why some reviewers say that they watch this version at times other than Christmas. There were also different scenes placed in this version that I hadn't seen before. But even the common scenes from all the versions were scaled back slightly and paced more deliberately.
The Alastair Sim version is also marvelous and I highly recommend it. I'm not saying I like this version better than the Sim version; it's just that this version created a much different experience for me. Just be prepared to be involved in this version at a much deeper level than the 1951 version.
In addition to George C. Scott, all the actors were incredible. Perhaps the skills of the supporting cast are where some of the other versions fall short. The actors for Marley and Tiny Tim were especially superb. The nephew was masterfully done but also mannered slightly different than what I was familiar with.
My final word is that this version was written, performed and filmed perfectly. Nicely done.",1165622400,5,1375,4.7573221757322175
727560,5,6303824358,"Charles Dickens, my favorite author, believed in the native goodness of human beings and clearly saw that treating our fellow humans well or badly is a choice we make every day, and that we have the capacity to change our long-held patterns as quickly as we will ourselves to. All of his books say that and show it, but in 'A Christmas Carol' he presented it in its briefest and purest form and it is my heart's favorite of all he wrote.

I had never seen a film or television version of it that pleased me. They all cut essential scenes or added ones that watered down the message or distracted from it, so when this version first appeared on television I was prepared to be displeased once again. Especially since I could not see George C. Scott as a believable Ebenezer Scrooge, even though I admired him as an actor.

From the moment it began, I was in love, transported by the faithfulness of the script to the book, in awed appreciation of the attention to visual period detail and the music, and blown away by the casting of the supporting parts and the excellent performances by them. (The only thing that makes me wince is the boy who plays Tiny Tim. He speaks his line like he'd been to the dentist and the novocaine hadn't completely worn off his lips.)

As others have noted, Edward Woodward is a vital, expansive Christmas Present who has the wit and power to drive home his points on a range from subtle to powerful. Roger Rees does an excellent job with nephew Fred, whom too often is played as giddy or foolish in his cheerfulness. Rees shows him to a better depth, self-sufficient and dedicated to never giving up on his mother's beloved brother. (Kudos to Donner for the subtle touch of the facial resemblance between Rees and the actress that played his mother.)

But George C. Scott floored me with the range and depth of his portayal of Scrooge, and he makes the thawing of Scrooge from a cold, detached and hard-hearted man to a warm, thoughtful family man completely believable. He clearly shows that the commodity of human love and warmth had always abandoned or been withheld from Ebenezer, leaving him to only trust the value of the coins and currency he could physically grasp and hold on to.

I encourage you all to give this production of this classic story a try. I believe it is the definitive version and the one Dickens himself would most appreciate.",1165622400,6,2383,4.558411214953271

George C. Scott did a marvelous job in this role as he did in so many others throughout his career. He is sorely missed and I was extremely happy to find that he had played this part, and so wonderfully.

Although everyone has their favorite Scrooge, this one has become my favorite. Second would be the Alistair Sim version, and next favorite I suppose would be Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Scrooge.

The faithfulness to the text is also evident.  Scrooge becomes less a man to be feared than one to be pitied.  It isn't that he is angry with the world as in other versions, is is more that he is missing so much.  When he puts his arms around his nephew and his wife and says, ""God forgive me for the time I've wasted,"" tears come to my eyes, even after 22 seasons of watching.

The interplay between Scrooge and Belle are interesting.  You get the impression that they should have been married and would have been very happy except that Scrooge was in love with money and not her.  When she walks away, I want to scream at him.

727598,5,6303824358,"I've read ""A Christmas Carol"" more times over the years than I can count.  I own three editions of the book (I recommend the 'Annotated Christmas Carol' for anyone wanting to delve deeper into the book, the period, and conditions that brought about it's production).  This is most definitely the film version that captures the spirit and message of the story the best.

George C. Scott gives us a Scrooge that is the ultimate  Victiorian utilitarian being.  No human interaction is allowed to come between him and his goal of increase.  Yet he gives us glimpses even from the beginning of a man who has the capacity to be redeemed, which makes him a much more believable character than say, the Alistair Sim Scrooge of the 1950's British version.  He is a Scrooge with a sense of humor, as portrayed in the book, even if the humor is mean spirited and serves mainly to amuse himself.  To the reviewer earlier who posted the 6th paragraph of the book as proof that Scott's Scrooge was off the mark... read the rest of the book. Dickens liked to portray his characters in broad strokes when introducing them and then flesh out their character throughout the rest of the story.  Scrooge's humor is evident, and Scott captures it.  ""more of gravy than of grave about you...""

The rest of the cast is stellar with special kudos to David Warner's Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward's Ghost of Christmas Present.  Woodward is wonderful with the banter between the ghost and Scrooge, forcing Scrooge to face the reality of the cruel jokes he tosses off to distance himself from humanity.

One special scene I am grateful for the filmakers to have included in the film.  While not explicitly in the book, it is implied by Scrooge's travels with the Ghost of Christmas Present. Scrooge is shown a homeless family at the end of their rope. The father is not too lazy to work, there is just no work available for him, and what work is available would not support his family.  Scrooge, and us, are shown the realities of poverty and the reality that people in poverty are not always the shiftless, lazy people the callous, unsympathetic like to portray them as.  Will the poor always be with us?  Yes.  But their lot will be worse as long as Ignorance and Want are kept hidden beneath the robes of Christmas Present.  Or under flood waters in New Orleans.  Or in the ghettos of our modern cities.

Watch this production and remember, this story was written to encourage us all to be charitable.  Is there a better reason for this season?",1134864000,14,2522,4.632882882882883

727600,5,6303824358,"I've seen several different versions of A Christmas Carol, including the original from 1951, and I have to say that by far this is the best version.  It's been quite some time since I've seen the original and I don't remember it well, and I can understand those who appreciate the original version the most.  It's good, but this version is the best.  This movie has become an annual must-watch in my family.

George C. Scott showed his incredible talent as an actor from beginning to end in this movie, and was brilliant in showing Scrooge's ignorance, nastiness, greed, and every other trait that made Scrooge ""Scrooge"".  Not only Scott, but the other actors in the movie (for the most part) were terrific as well, and this cast overall is the best.  Bob Cratchit, and the Ghost of Christmas Present also were both very enjoyable.

But the best thing about this movie is that you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll begin to feel sorry for Scrooge's character, and rejoice when his soul is saved, and it will make you want to be a better person - it's everything that Christmas spirit is all about!  I've never seen another version of this story that achieved this affect quite as well as this one.

The scene where Cratchit comes home to his family after visiting Tiny Tim's grave is one of the most emotionally moving scenes of the movie and never fails to bring tears to my eyes, and is soon followed by a most dramatic finale between Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come where George C. Scott completely steals the show with his performance and Scrooge vows to completely change his ways.  One moment I'm in tears, the next I want to do a Jimmy Stewart and run down the street yelling ""Merry Christmas!"".  What a movie!  Okay, I'm done hamming it up now, but trust me, this is a great movie - and I don't use the word ""great"" very often when reviewing movies.

However, I watched the George C. Scott version when it was first telecast, and he won my heart.  I always thought, from reading the story, that Scrooge's unpleasantness wasn't really just ingrained nastiness, but the result of being unloved as a child and ever after afraid to care for anyone. Scott portrays this magnificently.  You can actually see the change from heartsick young boy to reserved and workaholic young man to embittered and withdrawn old man.  This version, even more than my (formerly) beloved Reginald Owens version, clearly makes the point that no man is irredeemable, it's never too late to change, and all you really need is love.",1132617600,15,897,4.836601307189542

This version is also the most faithful to the classic.  It also uses fabulous historic settings and period music.  The supporting cast, including David Warner as Bob Crachitt, Edward Woodward as Christmas Present, and many other familiar faces, is also tops!

Buy this and you will watch it every year.  Geoge C. Scott is a Scrooge enraptured with his parsimony, yet also joyous in his redemption.  You will love it.

727637,5,6303824358,"George C Scott is outstanding as the miserly, miserable Scrooge. This is one of the finest productions of this Charles Dickens classic story about the miserable Ebenezer Scrooge being shown the error of his ways. Arriving home on Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his old partner Jacob Marley who warns the old man that his immortal soul will wander the earth for eternity if he doesn't mend his miserly ways. He is also warned he will be visited by three ghosts, Christmas past, Christmas present and Christmas future.
The ghost of Christmas past reminds Scrooge of the person he used to be; a more caring and fun loving soul before greed took him over. The second ghost shows Scrooge the lives of those around him, in particular that of his poverty stricken clerk, Bob Cratchitt, and his family. Scrooge starts to feel stirrings of guilt when he sees that Cratchitt's son, Tiny Tim, is very ill and may die if help isn't received soon. The final ghost, Christmas Future, is the one who strikes terror into Scrooges heart. He shows the miser what a miserable, lonely death awaits him if he doesn't change.
This Christmas classic has been well produced and the picture is nice and sharp on this transfer to DVD and the sound quality is good. This is a `must watch' movie for the holiday season.",1108771200,4,1310,4.650862068965517

727639,5,6303824358,"The given wisdom is that Sim's 1951 version of Scrooge is the definitive.

Now isn't it time for you to decide for yourself?

This version was made in 1984 at the height of the greed-driven 80's where everyone thought the most important thing to be was a Wall Street power broker selling junk bonds and Reagan's economic policies gave us the start of the homeless problem which persists today.  Considering Scrooge was a money lender, it's hard not to have a bit of poignancy of the issues of charity and kindness to others seep through the production.  Dickens wrote ""A Christmas Carol"", like all his works, as a social commentary - so it's not surprising to see real touches of political commentary in the drama.

As originally written, the tragedy of Ebenezer is that he was highly successful, highly powerful, and highly intelligent and yet cut-off from his fellow man.  George C. Scott infuses a deep intelligence in Ebenezer that Dickens intended.  The subtle humor of this version, often relayed in the form of sarcasm, gives a richer characterization (not recognizing Tiny Tim, who is waiting for his father to finish work, Scrooge tells the cripple: ""Don't beg on this corner, boy"").

The script is spectacular.  It is highly faithful to the spirit of the original Dickens.  Even added dialogue regarding the use of coal in the office highlights the interaction between Scrooge and Cratchit and characterizes Scrooge, including his intimidating use of logic, immediately.  If you hadn't read the original, you wouldn't even know it was added to the story.

Besides, no one but Scott could deliver the line ""Misterrrrrrrrr Cratchit!"" so powerfully.

Give yourself a real Christmas treat and see what one of the best American actors of the last century can do with such a familiar tale.",1103846400,10,1793,4.9366666666666665

Sims bulgy eyeballed stares impart his sheer terror while going thru his revelation of the Christmas season.
This version is the remake of the 1930's edition which is also interesting to watch for the time period it was made in, but the story line is a little different in small details from the Alastair Sim version listed here.

727642,1,6303824358,"I believe I've seen just about every version of Dickens classic, from Sim to McGoo; and I too looked forward to seeing George C. Scott play Scrooge.  Frankly, I was surprised that Scott could have so completely missed the core of the Scrooge character; I'm also baffled that anyone would think his version was the closest to the character in the book.

Scott's Scrooge was certainly different from all the rest.  He presented a Scrooge who delighted in his own bad temper, who beamed and laughed as he called Christmas a humbug and laughed out loud as he condemned well-wishers to be boiled in their Christmas pudding.  Different, but incomprehensibly wrong.

The whole point of Scrooge is that he is a person who delights in nothing, finds humor in nothing, and certainly never laughs at anything.  He tells the three gentlemen that he doesn't make himself merry at Christmas, and he will not make others merry.  His personality?...well, no one, certainly not I, can put it better than Dickens:

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!  Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire, secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.  The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue, and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice...  He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

This is in sixth paragraph! and there are further icy cold descriptions elsewhere.

It's impossible to reconcile Scott's laughing Scrooge with Dickens' creation of a man who never made himself merry, and whose icy core froze his features.  No, Dickens' portrait is of a man whose greed and avarice have squeezed out any humor, any delight, and all joy from him--to the point that he mistakes his own misery for satisfaction, and his own souless existence for success.

Even his sunny nephew sees that his uncle finds not one flicker of happiness in anything.  When Scrooge tells him:

""...What reason have you to be merry?  You're poor enough?

""Come then,"" returned the nephew gaily.  What right have you to be dismal?  What reason have you to be morose?  You're rich enough.""

Dismal?  Morose?  The cold within him froze his features?  The whole point of the book is that bonding with others, finding sympathy and caring about those around him, melts Scrooge's frozen soul.  In Scott's portrayal all we can say about Scrooge is merely that he finds joy in the wrong things.

Other versions--any of the other versions, including Mr. McGoo's--is far better.  I can't imagine a worse ""Christmas Carol.""",1102723200,54,2809,4.891949152542373

The fine (and consistently underrated) David Warner is a sympathetic (and at times heartbreaking) Bob Cratchit without being overly sentimental. Brilliant Edward Woodward offers the finest of all Ghost of Christmas Presents committed to film. The towering Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is truly frightening on all counts (children be warned!). The production design, jublient score, costumes and cinematography are all first class. Try NOT to get choked up when Scrooge tells his nephew's wife that he was once in love.

George C. Scott captures the nuances of a man who has closed himself off to his past but is made to face what he's given up.

727650,5,6303824358,"Every winter, I enjoy watching A Christmas Carol on TV whenever I can, and the 1984 version is my favorite. The production and performances add up to a moody, realistic and touching adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.
Director Clive Donner (editor of the much celebrated 1951 Alastair Sim version of Scrooge) presents a stunningly authentic recreation of Dickens' London. From effectively foggy streets to Ebenezer's own cobwebbed-infested manor, Donner provides a gritty, appropriately dark atmosphere, enhanced by the wonderful score.
The film's pacing is exquisite. In showing Ebenezer the error of his ways, the filmmakers give equal time to his past, present and future, never once lingering to the point of boredom. Thus the story seems to fly by compared to the other adaptations.
George C. Scott is excellent as Scrooge. Like all of those who've portrayed the character, his old miser starts out mean and bitter and ends up joyous and thankful! But throughout his performance, true sadness runs deep. Scott makes his emotional transformation subtle, painting a realistic portrait of a man haunted by the mistakes of his past, taking his pain out on the world.
But what separates the 1984 production of Christmas Carol from all others is the terrific supporting cast. David Warner may give the warmest performance of his career as Bob Cratchet (all the more poignant considering the many villains he's played over the years). Frank Finlay is the most compelling Jacob Marley I've ever seen. You can almost feel this man's torture just by gazing upon his unblinking expression. Edward Woodward brings great depth to the Ghost of Christmas Present, communicating tremendous power, yet just the right touch of humor. Finally, this adaptation of the Dickens' tale features the scariest, most intimidating Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come you'll find anywhere!
Most of us look forward to a healthy dose of A Christmas Carol at the end of each year and we all have our favorite version. Thanks to the handsome production values, expert pacing and perfect cast, led by the magnificent George C. Scott, I believe they truly got it right in 1984!",1073606400,59,2150,5.110795454545454

By far, his is the finest Scrooge to be filmed, easily believable and ""hate-able"" and equally sympathetic and likable after his redemption. David Warner, easily one of the most underrated and overlooked actors of the screen, is the perfect Bob Cratchit. Anyone not touched by his performance in the Tiny Tim death timeline has a heart of pure stone. His interaction with the rest of his ""family"" is thoroughly convincing and heartwarming. Roger Rees is magnificent as Ebenezer's nephew, Fred.  It's easy to feel he really wishes to connect with his uncle and genuinely rejoices when it finally happens in the conclusion.  Edward Woodward and the Ghost of Christmas Present seems to have been lifted from the pages of the very Dickens manuscript. He is the duplicate of the John Leech illustration in the 1843 original.  The only flaw with this production are the wooden performances of the two younger Cratchit children in some scenes.  Unfortunately, the youngest is, of course, Tiny Tim.  Even so, the young actor portraying him does an admirable and mostly convincing job.  (Blooper alert, though: Look over Scrooge's shoulder as he is standing at Fred's door - unmistakable aluminium drainspouts across the street. Minor, but distracting to the scene.)

Given that this film is a made for television it has great film sets and special effects.  This film has captured what I would have thought an urban area in mid to late 1800's in England would have looked like.

727685,4,6303824358,"This 1984 adaptation of the Charles Dickens story has several noteworthy things going for it. In this writer's opinion, the parts are greater than the whole, but the individual aspects are well worth viewing.
George C. Scott's Ebenezer Scrooge is almost chilling. In Scott's hands Scrooge is calmly insistent in his ways, and relentlessly cold. It's a fine, unique characterization with many subtleties; other actors deliver the ""stake of holly through his heart"" dialogue as a grouchy peeve, but with Scott it's a grisly joke that Scrooge is especially enjoying. His controlled reserve is admirable for the most part, but misplaced at the finish. One wants to see the Ghosts of Christmas tear off his miser's mask and really scare the stuffing out of him. But somehow Scrooge's reclamation is neither as drastic nor as effective as in other film versions. Scrooge's delighted laugh in the last reel is about the same as his ironic laugh in the first reel.
The supporting portrayals vary in faithfulness to Dickens. Scrooge's nephew Fred, a breezy, friendly character who says he'll ""keep my Christmas spirit to the last,"" certainly doesn't show it by his timid and soft-spoken demeanor here. On the other hand, Edward Woodward is outstanding as the Ghost of Christmas Present, a hearty giant who delights in showing Scrooge up.
Director Clive Donner adds some deft touches (Marley's Ghost howls ""Scrooooooooge"" as a horse-drawn coffin passes by; for once Scrooge has enough of a Ghost, and terminates the visitation forcibly). There are enough points of distinction to recommend this as a good picture. This writer gives the George C.

And it's the same reason Clive Donner's version, out of all the many filmed and staged retellings, is still around and now being offered in DVD format: they are, quite simply, both the best of their breed. The script is faithful to Dickens' original text as few other versions have been, the production values are sumptuous and conscientious in their historical accuracy, and the performances from a star-packed cast are pure British sterling, above all the late, lamented George C. Scott's unforgettable limning of an all too human Ebenezer Scrooge. Also not to be missed are Edward (THE EQUALIZER) Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present, cruelly rebuking Scrooge with his own words; Mark Strickson (Turlough of DOCTOR WHO fame) as the young Scrooge in the Christmas Past sequence; Roger Rees, Susannah York, Frank Finlay as a suitably fearsome Marley's Ghost, the always reliable David Warner as Bob Cratchit, Angela Pleasance as the gentle Ghost of Christmas Past, Joanne Whalley (the former Mrs. Val Kilmer, of SCANDAL and many other films) and Michael Gough (another DOCTOR WHO veteran [the Celestial Toymaker in Hartnell's First Doctor era] and Alfred the butler in the BATMAN films).

Seeing Scott as Scrooge crying out in anguish over his own gravestone, ""Why show me this if I am past all hope?""; then on Christmas morning, jumping up and down on his four-poster with glee; showing up on his nephew's doorstep, properly shame-faced and hoping for a chance to begin again -- these moments bring a tear to my eye and a lump to my throat every time. If you need a reminder of why this season is so important even to those of us who have lost faith in the Christian church, bookend this film with Clive's brother Richard Donner's equally excellent updating of Dickens' classic tale, SCROOGED, starring Bill Murray (his speech at the end is worth the price of the DVD all by itself!) for a night of holiday laughter and tears like no other. Scrooge embodies the hope that all of us have that, whatever our failings and our misdeeds, our lives may yet be counted of value and our souls admitted into heaven; and this version of his odyssey from miserdom to redemption makes it abundantly clear why this one short story holds such a special place in the canon of Western literature.",1071792000,7,2460,4.815602836879433

George C. Scott masterfully plays Ebenezer Scrooge.  Set in 19th century England, Scrooge is a miserly, greedy businessman who has set about to build his fortune, despite the adverse effect his life has had on everyone around him.  As Christmas approaches, he is visited by the spirit of his recently deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who admonishes that Scrooge will be visited by three spirits of Christmas who will help him to see the errors of his life.  Through each of their visits, Scrooge is given glimpses of Christmas past, present and future through a series of vignette experiences that reflect parts of his life, and where his life will ultimately lead him should his own spirit go unchanged.
The movie serves up a very poignant and important reminder about the true meaning and spirit of Christmas, and it is a great and entertaining film for the whole family.  ""A Christmas Carol"" features first rate performances by the entire cast; especially endearing is the relationship between Bob Cratchit (David Warner) and his son, ""Tiny"" Tim Chatchit (Anthony Walters).  Additional noteworthy performances include Edward Woodward as the boisterous and prophetic Ghost of Christmas Present, and the delightful Roger Rees as Fred Holywell, Ebenezer Scrooge's nephew.

Hirson actually makes some excellent additions to the original story, fleshing out why the happy young Ebenezer we see in our visit to the past becomes the old Scrooge who undergoes this Yule time transformation.  The only knock on the performance from my perspective is that like many fans of ""A Christmas Carol"" it is hard not to remember the superb performance by Alastair Sim in the 1951 film version and find the Oscar winning Scott coming second in the comparison.  Still, this is arguably the most thoughtful performance of Scrooge you will see.
But even if Scott's performance is found lacking by such a strict standard (Sim's performance remains the standard by which all other Scrooge's are judged), the rest of this production is superb.  The supporting cast is as fine as has ever been assembled to play the other roles: David Warner providing a nice twist on Bob Cratchit, Susanna York as his wife, Frank Finlay as the ghost of Jacob Marley, Joanne Whalley as Fan, the girl who got away from young Ebenezer, and Roger Rees as Scrooge's nephew Fred (and the film's narrator).  The trio of ghostly visitors who visit Scrooge all in one night are equally strong, with Angela Pleasence as the Ghost of Christmas Past, Edward Woodward getting everybody to say ""Look, its the Equalizer!"" as the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Michael Carter as the best Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come that I have seen.
Director Clive Donner had done ""Oliver Twist"" for television two years earlier (as well as ""The Scarlet Pimpernel""), and does another solid effort of presenting these well-known Dickensian characters and events.  Production designer Roger Murray-Leach provides an old London towne that looks as great as any we have seen before for one of these films.  But above all it is the cast and the thoughtful script that make this a superb adaptation.  In the end my preference for the 1951 version comes down entirely to Sim's performance as the euphoric Scrooge.  Fortunately, close counts for a lot when it comes to ranking favorite versions of ""A Christmas Carol.""",1069200000,6,3028,4.786948176583493
727691,2,6303824358,"This adaptation can be seen now as purely a product of its era: the Materialistic Reagan Eighties.  (In fact, this & Bill Murray's '88 ""Scrooged"" make an ideal double-feature.) Critics at the time (mostly the TV sort) did handstands over this umpteenth take on Dickens' classic, some even saying it was better than any other version.
I WILL come out and say the one good thing about this film is that it sent me back to reading the original book (I'd endured two adaptations that year--this, and the first Muppet version, from '92 with Michael Caine).  But the script for this one simply PRETENDS to be a faithful adaptation: it's told primarily from Scrooge's perspective.....we're supposed to ""bah"" to his every ""humbug"" and vice versa.  And Scott's performance is worthy of a Nicholson in ""The Shining""--all high camp, with the star sparing no opportunity to chew the scenery and mug shamelessly at every close-up.  Needless to say, the Great Scott's done better elsewhere. There's no real RANGE to this performance--even at the climactic meeting with the Ghost-Of-Christmas-Yet-To-Come, he seems unfazed.  Scott's Scrooge doesn't seem to be a changed man in the end--I'm fully expecting him to FIRE Bob Cratchit Dec. 26!!
The lesson to be learned here? Ebenezer Scrooge isn't Wile E. Coyote.

727704,5,6303824358,"Of course everybody knows the famous Charles Dickens novel, ""A Chritmas Carol"" that's about an old rich, rude and lonely businessman that takes Christmas and everything for granted. Well out of all the Christmas Carol movies, this is the MASTERPIECE! This one captures the story the best. George C. Scott did an EXCELLENT job playing the evil Ebenezer Scrooge.
We all know about Ebenezer's old dead business partner Jacob Marley visiting him on Christmas Eve and warning him not to take life for granted and also telling him that he'll be visited by the three ghosts of Christmas: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present, and The Ghost of Christmas Future. We go back in time and visit Ebenezer's childhood at his boarding school. Then we visit the present Christmas where we see his poor employee, Bob Cratchett eating dinner with his family and also his nephew and his wife enjoying their Christmas. After that we see the Christmas Future which convinces Ebenezer to turn over a new leaf and become a good man after he sees his grave. Then he appreciated life a lot more and it a brand new man. ""MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!""
This movie has the perfect cast, the perfect settings and the perfect emotional effects than any other movie about this novel. To me, it had a lot effect on my feelings towards Christmas.

George C. Scott plays Ebenezer Scrooge in this version, and he is absolutely fantastic.  He plays the role of the miser to perfection, attaining just the right amount of nastiness without going overboard.  Yet he also shows the tender side when necessary, particularly as it pertains to Tiny Tim.  David Warner, one of my favorite actors nobody's ever heard of, plays Bob Cratchit and he, too, is excellent as Scrooge's kindhearted employee.  The only other really notable actor is Roger Rees as Scrooge's nephew Fred, but pretty much all the actors in this movie are excellent, even if you don't recognize them.
The feel of the movie is also excellent.  The sets make you feel very much like you're in 19th century London, while other things, like the costumes and street performers, really put you in the middle of that time.  The music is also outstanding, and fits this movie perfectly.

727752,5,6303824358,"Christmas just isn't Christmas unless you watch at least one version of A Christmas Carol, and this is by far my favorite.  George C. Scott gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen an actor give; he truly becomes Ebenezer Scrooge to the fullest degree possible.  Scott can say more with just the slightest hint of a facial movement than many actors can say during the course of an entire movie.  All of the performers here are excellent, bringing to life adored characters such as Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and Scrooge's nephew Fred.  All four spirits are remarkable, none more so than Scrooge's old partner Jacob Marley; having Marley's jaw drop after untying the burial cloth holding his mouth closed is an important aspect of the story and certainly does make an impression on the viewer.  This is just one example of the moviemakers' faithfulness to Charles Dickens' original story; another would be the inclusion of the two miserable children, Ignorance and Want, beneath the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present.
This timeless tale works extremely well on its own, but the unsurpassed acting skills of Scott make it almost more than real.  The change wrought in him during the course of the night, as he changes from a man of crass materialism and unkindness to a repentant soul pleading for a chance to change his ways, is powerfully presented and really touches the viewer emotionally.  The simple happiness revealed in the lives of Bob Cratchit and others are as heart-warming as the forgotten mistakes and pains of a younger Scrooge are agonizing.  If there is any heart out there that is not touched by the goodness and courage of Tiny Tim, I don't even want to know about it.  No matter how many times you watch this movie, it proves itself capable of bringing a tear to your eye, a lump in your throat, and ultimately the very spirit of true holiday cheer and Christian charity that Dickens intended it to convey.
I cannot say I have seen every adaptation of A Christmas Carol, but I really cannot believe any other version could exceed the quality and emotional impact of this one.  No matter how many times I read the story or watch the movie, it remains a source of eternal joy to me.  This is more than a movie for me; it is an important and necessary part of each and every Christmas holiday season.",1039564800,386,2333,4.6658536585365855

Even if you think the 1951 or some other version is the best I will be very surprised if you aren't impressed with this version of A Christmas Carol.,1039392000,,520,4.316326530612245
727754,5,6303824358,"It is not an easy thing at all to take a literary masterpiece and fully adapt it to the screen or stage.  In the case of this timeless classic of Dickens, it is especially true.  Having just seen an operatic rendition of A Christmas Carol and being somewhat disappointed in the adaptation, I have now seen five different efforts to adapt Dickens' written work to either stage or screen.  This particular effort, while not perfect, is still the best effort yet attempted.
It is clear that casting George C Scott in the role of Scrooge may single-handedly elevate this adaptation above all others.  Scott is perfect for the role, and he devours it almost as if Dickens had written the character with him in mind.  More than any other attempt at portraying Scrooge, Scott is extremely believable in his interpetation and therefore makes the Scrooge character riveting.
The supporting cast is also very good, as are the sets and costumes that compellingly take the audience on a convincing journey back in time.  Edward Woodward in particular, is outstanding in his role.
As with many Christmas stories that have a decidedly religious element to them, there is always the very clear issue of how far modern adaptations will go in trying to secularize the story and downplay the religious aspects of the original work.  This version of the Christmas Carol story is no exception.  To its credit, this version maintains a notable amount of the overtly and covertly Christian themes that drive the story, although observant viewers will note that some of these themes, while rather overt in Dickens, become somewhat shadowy here.  Scrooge's redemption at the end of the movie, while inspiring, is not overtly linked to religious salvation - which is a notable omission that the later Patrick Stewart version properly reintroduces to some degree.
But nonetheless, the moral bankruptcy of materialism, and the notable Christian themes of love, charity, compassion, a social conscience towards the poor and larger society, and contentment even in the midst of poverty are strongly portrayed in this version.  The Cratchit family is correctly portrayed as a God fearing family who reads the Bible, goes to church, and displays consistent Christian values in their home.  The audience is properly led to see a tragic contrast between the poor and mistreated but content Cratchit family, and the rich but tortured Scrooge.
Fantastic performances all around.  It is a joyful thing to see a literary classic brought to life by inspired performances that are worthy of it.  It is a joy to watch this version of A Christmas Carol every year.  It is an affirmation of timeless values that the eternal God of Christianity created.",1038182400,6,2710,5.006681514476615
727755,5,6303824358,"George C. Scott gave many unforgettable performances, but perhaps his most memorable is that of Ebenezer Scrooge in this 1984 TV movie.  At the time of its release, Scott openly admitted that, when he began work on the film, he knew he was operating in the shadow of Alastair Sim, who had made the role of Scrooge his own in the 1951 British film classic.  Sim was the first film actor to seriously approach the character and to play him as a real, multi-dimensional human being whom we find detestable in the beginning, but likable and somewhat tragic in the end.  Because Sim's version had been considered definitive for more than 30 years, Scott was facing not only a challenging acting assignment, but also Sim's well-deserved reputation and recognition as Scrooge.  Thus, Scott's magnificent performance is all the more remarkable.  He too breathes life into the character and arouses the audience's interest in him.  Few actors could have seduced audiences into temporarily forgetting Sim and viewing Scrooge as a new character, but Scott did it.  In his hands Scrooge's life becomes real and meaningful - sad, tragic and, in the end, joyful.  The film itself is easily the most beautiful production of the story ever preserved on film and it boasts the best supporting cast, led by David Warner, Edward Woodward, Frank Finlay, Roger Rees, and Susannah York.  Sim and Scott left two indelible portraits of Dickens' wonderful character in two stellar film adaptations.  We are fortunate to be able to enjoy both of them.",1038182400,23,1525,4.9450980392156865

727757,5,6303824358,"Yes, there are a few liberties taken with Dickens' original text, but this version of Christmas Carol is quite true to the message which Dickens conveyed. Powerful images, and George C Scott's very natural (as opposed to ""cartoonish"") portrayal of Scrooge, rescue the work from the ""children's story"" genre into which other adaptations often fall.
If someone is interested in a film that is ""entertainment for the whole family,"" s/he may not find this version to be a favourite, because it is not pure entertainment. The poor are shown in their genuine state, not as the exceedingly happy crowd in a fictional London! For example, one extremely powerful sequence is when Scrooge, during his travels with the Ghost of Christmas Present, sees families huddled over makeshift fires, seeking shelter under a bridge. Scrooge learns, from what he hears, that families indeed would rather die than go to the workhouse - the poor laws would separate them one from the other.
Though there are various fine adaptations of Christmas Carol, this one is probably singular in that there is no exagerration in the depiction of any character. Fred is a reserved, rather shy young man - Bob Cratchitt's family enjoy each other's company but are not excessively joyous. Scott's Scrooge is the ultimate laissez faire capitalist, proud of his financial success for all that, as he comes to learn during the ghosts' visits, pursuing this has made him isolated from human warmth and totally indifferent towards anyone else. Scrooge is not a caricature, nor a monster - but one who placed all of his trust in business gain. The scene where he spies his former beloved, Belle, with her spouse and children, and realises that this life could have been his, is very moving. (Though Belle appears to have no less material wealth than Ebenezer.)

One of the most endearing characters in all of literature is Ebenezer Scrooge, the brooding miser in dire need of reclamation.  George C.

The scenes after Scrooge's redemption, both in his home and (although it is not in the book) where he visits Fred and his wife on Christmas morning definately warms the heart.

727761,5,6303824358,"I reviewed this movie a couple of years ago, but the few (too few!) sentences I wrote does not do justice to this, my all-time favorite.
  'A Christmas Carol.' Is there any other story that epitomizes what the modern day Christmas celebration is all about? And who would have thought this very English fable written over 150 years ago would be every bit as alive today here in the 21st century United States as it was in 1843 England when first published? Gerald Charles Dickens, great great grandson of THE Charles Dickens, was quoted recently as saying, ""The 'Carol' is 10 times more popular in America than it is in England. In England, the 'Carol' is just a story. In America the 'Carol' IS Christmas.""
  And, to me, THIS is THE version to watch.
  The opening scene of this great version literally grabs you and pulls you into the gray, wintry Dickens London on Christmas Eve day 1843. The viewer will feel as if they were walking down the cobblestone streets of Merry Olde England, passing the street vendors hawking their wares, and hearing the carolers and street musicians singing and playing that wonderful Victorian Holiday music. Top hats and bonnets abound as the crowd of people - rich and poor alike - rush to celebrate this most Holy of Christian nights. That is, all but one. And the first image of old Ebenezer Scrooge, played here to perfection by the late great George C. Scott, will send chills down the back of even the most ardent skeptic.
  Just think...if the opening scene is this good, you can just imagine how great the rest of this movie is!
  I'm sure there is no need for me to explain the story line of 'A Christmas Carol,' only that, of all the versions that have been filmed, this one is by far the best and most realistic I have yet to witness.
  Now what puts this version of Charles Dickens' classic tale above the others available? First and foremost, as I explained in my first review, is the feel. There is a certain ambiance here - a sort of realism - that is not present in the others. As stated previously, you, as the viewer, are drawn into the movie as a willing participant to the events happening about you. Given that this movie was filmed not on a stage set in Hollywood, but in and around actual buildings that were standing during the period in which this story takes place alone gives this version an edge the others can't touch. And the authentic costumes are as accurate as I have seen.
  Another major plus here is that Dickens' original story is followed much closer than in any of the other versions. The scriptwriters had a very easy task since they pulled a majority (but not all) of their lines directly from the book! And the casting was pert near perfect as well. In fact, the only character I felt that was miss-cast was the actor (who's name escapes me) that played the role of Scrooge's nephew, Fred. Not toward the beginning of the film when he's inviting his uncle to dine with him, but toward the end when Uncle Ebenezer IS dining with him. A bit of over-acting here. A small blip ever so minor that, because of just how phenomenal the rest of the movie is, one would hardly notice. Not enough to lower any part of the score!
  The Ghost of Jacob Marley tears at your heart, for the believability factor here is high that this specter is truly wrenching in pain and sorrow for his life's deeds. And the Ghost of Christmas Present, with his sarcastic wit, easily puts Scrooge in his place simply by using Scrooge's own lack of common sense and lack of courtesy against him.
  Virtually everything about this version of 'A Christmas Carol' surpasses its predecessors. All the 'Carols,' before and since, have been good to very good. But this George C. Scott ranks far above them all. I don't think even Masterpiece Theater - the greatest at filming Dickens' stories - could do better.

When our home-taped version wore out, we bought the video.  I have since bought the DVD version for myself and whatever family I have in the future.
This version is simply the best I've seen.  The late George C. Scott gets beyond the characiture of Scrooge that is engrained in our cultural memory and he brilliantly inhabits the humanity of the character.  The other actors (Susannah York as Mrs. Cratchit, David Warner as Bob Cratchit, Roger Rees as Fred Hollywell, Angela Pleasance as Christmas Past and Edward Woodward as Christmas Present) are all the equal of Mr. Scott.
Dickensian London is brought to life vividly in the town of Shrewsbury.  The costuming and cimematography are first class, especially for a television film.

727790,5,6303824358,"Acting doesn't get any closer to art than in George C. Scott's portrayal of the immortal miser, Ebenezer Scrooge. His performance is so good that it made me forget his turn as ""Patton"" -- and I didn't think anything could do that. I saw this on TV when it came out in 1985 and got it for Xmas (go figure) in 2001, and it holds up perfectly, always the mark of a true classic. There have been several versions of this Dickens tale, most notably by Alistair Sim and Patrick Stewart, and even a ""modernized"" version with Bill Murray (""Scrooged"") but this is the best. The Sim version had elements which were written specifically for the movie, while Stewart went the opposite route and tried to reproduce the story as it was originally written. Here, however, the producers were clearly going for the essence of the story, with some of the more tedious, dated, and melodramatic elements eliminated. Scott's interpretation of Scrooge is that of a bitter, isolated man who has forgotten that he is a member of the human race. Long ago, he had all the elements that would have made a great and happy man, but he chose the path of financial success instead. Over the course of the three visitations from the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet To Come, he is battered back into contact with his own humanity. What makes this familiar tale so much better this time around is the acting -- Scott, faced with the revelations about his nature, is like a general trying to hold his (moral) ground at all costs. Watching him crumble by degrees leaves you awestruck by the depth of his acting ability. By the time the last ghost shows him his desolate, abandoned grave, we feel we have seen the character in sum -- good, bad, and ugly qualities all brutally exposed. And when he wakes up the next morning, his transformation seems real and appropriate, not forced. Of course, Scott is backed up by a first-class cast, with especially good performances by David Warner and Edward Woodward, but in fact there are no weak links in the acting. Furthermore, the production is excellent, more suited to a big-screen release than a TV movie. In fact, it's hard to believe this wasn't a feature film.

727792,5,6303824358,"A wondrous spectacle of the famed holiday classic that may have done better as a theatrical release, Clive Donner's television rendition of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" is perhaps the most successful version of the oft-told story. Featuring a handsome production design that outshines many other television movies, a delightful and poignant performance from George C. Scott, and a trio of ghosts that supply real fright, this is one adaptation that captures the heart of the novel with impressive results.
The story of Ebenezer Scrooge is made much more emotionally pliable under Scott's acting, who brings out of the very cruelest qualities in Scrooge. Most importantly, he convinces us that Scrooge's miserly ways stem from a lack of love in life rather than from sheer hatred for much of mankind and their celebration of Christmas. His despicable treatment of his secretary, Bob Cratchit, and his refusal to lend charitable assistance have made him an icon of his town, much to the dismissal of Cratchit as well as his own nephew, Fred Holywell, who believes there must be some good in his miserable uncle.
One fateful Christmas Eve, Ebenezer is visited by his deceased partner, Jacob Marley, set up superbly through a series of bump-in-the-night chills throughout his cold, empty mansion, and ghostly apparitions and voices that are truly frightening. Warned of his fate, he is later visited by three spirits at the strokes of one and two o'clock, with a third that will appear in due time.
The visitations of these spirits provide us the sometimes gleeful, but always uneasy life of Ebenezer, whose childhood centered around the disdain of his father, and whose adolescence began his growing obsession with financial security over all else. With each visit comes a window into the past, the present, and the future, at which point he must decide whether or not he wishes to continue in his unfriendly ways and die alone and unloved.
The challenge of retelling such a well-known story, especially one that has been committed to film numerous times, is giving is a fresh feel. Donner has achieved this through his elegant production design, his great cast, and his reliance on the original source material. This version above all others is able to capture Scrooge's life in convincing detail, emotionally and physically. The fact that his father had an influence on his adult ways furthers our understanding of his attitude towards others; throughout the course of the night, each spirit's revelation deepens our sympathy for him, and our hope for his repentance.
Casting Scott in the main role lends much to that success: his versatility as an actor provides the character a unique and magnificent portrayal unmatched by all others to date. As Bob Cratchit, David Warner beautifully relates his character's attention to what is most important to him rather than his hardships; Frank Finlay is eerily frightening as Marley, while Angela Pleasence and Edward Woodward mix warmth with chills as the Spirits of Christmas Past and Present, respectively.
For a television movie, this one has lofty ambitions, evident in its glorious appearance. Filmed entirely in Shrewsbury, England, Donner captures the period and history of the novel, bringing authenticity to life before our very eyes. His biggest success rests with his envisioning of the third Spirit, that which is the most frightening of the three. Each filmed version portrays the apparition in a different manner, but I have yet to see one as completely terrifying as this. Draped in black and surrounded by fog, with a mere screech as its communication, this Spirit is guaranteed to send chills up and down your spine, and is a master portrayal of Dickens' character.
Destined to be one of the great Christmas classics, this rendition of ""A Christmas Carol"" mixes terror and glee in equal measure for a film that captures the Dickens novel beautifully and successfully. Scott's performance remains one of the best of his career, and outshines many other portrayals of the famed miser. Donner has outdone himself with this most vivid achievement: any other version of ""A Christmas Carol?"" Bah, humbug!",1009324800,10,4167,5.120411160058737

If you're only going to buy one Christmas Carol movie, this is it.  Who cares if George C. has a believable english accent?! That has NO bearing on the plot, whatsoever! This is a tale for all people of all time.  I find it MORE appealing in that he does not try to effect one and works on his craft and emotions rather than voices.
To deride such a tale over voices is like complaining about the hero's wardrobe while missing the acting that is taking place within the wardrobe!

This is true not only in the production department, including acting, direction, music, etc., but also in its accuracy to Dickens' literary masterwork. I have seen many different versions of this story with varying degrees of enjoyment, and this is the one to which I always return as the touchstone against which all others must be compared.
Charles Dickens set out to write a ghost story, complete with thrill, chills, and scares, set at Christmastide, which would shine with the true meaning of the holiday by the end. This version gives both the chills and the hope which Dickens wove into his story effectively and believably. The funereal opening on Christmas Eve gives way to the bright glories of Christmas Day, just as Ebenezer Scrooge's outlook on life blossoms from dismal to hopeful.
Although George C. Scott's masterful performance is the centre-piece of this production, he is surrounded by wonderful elements in all aspects of the film. From Clive Donner's excellent direction, and Nick Bict's brooding score, to Roger Hirson's marvelous screenplay, and the wonderful cast supporting Scott, the list of great achievements goes on and on, with no detail being overlooked.

They make him too miserly and too crotchety. That wasn't the point Dickens was trying to make with Scrooge; Dickens wanted him to be a bitter man who felt betrayed by the world, so escaped into $ for sanctuary. Enter George C. Scott with his masterful acting, and finally you have a good Scrooge. George C. Scott's Scrooge didn't speak in an irritating, grating voice that many other movie's did. His was cold and distant, but purposefully nasty. His attitude was leave me alone and I'll leave you alone, unless you owe me money.
George C. Scott always did have ways of making his characters believable, and Ebenezer Scrooge is no exception.",1007683200,,781,4.879699248120301

727797,5,6303824358,"Scott's 1984 ""A Christmas Carol"" puts all other portrayals to shame.
I have read ""A Christmas Carol"" several times, and feel qualified to say that George C. Scott's interpretation of ""Scrooge"" is the best that was ever done. Not only is Scott's portrayal true to the original novel (with some necessary condensation to fit it all into an hour and forty minutes), but Scott is the first believable Scrooge I have seen. All the rest, including the 1951 portrayal by Alistair Sim (which also took great liberties with the story), are comparatively lifeless, as if the actors are merely reading their lines from a cue card.
Scott's rendition is lively and believable, especially in the speech where Scrooge states that ""every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart."" Scott delivers the lines with laughter, so that he sounds realistically mean-spirited but not really intent on murder.
In all other films that retell ""A Christmas Carol,"" Tiny Tim is presented as whimpering and pathetic. Young Anthony Walters, in his first role, is lovable and believable as the ailing Tiny Tim,without unnecessary maudlin manipulation.
David Warner is outstanding as the affable and humble Bob Cratchit, and so many other roles are so well done that I could almost swear the characters had escaped the printed page.  In particular, Angela Pleasence is a wonderful Ghost of Christmas Past, gently steering the errant Ebenezer along the path to reclamation and pointing out the joys he had missed in his journey through life. Edward Woodward captures the essence of the Ghost of Christmas Present, and seems genuinely annoyed with Scrooge's selfishness and blindness to human charity. Finally, Roger Rees as Nephew Fred is so genuinely likable that I wished he was my nephew instead; and Timothy Bateson as the colorful and benificient Mr. Fezziwig has defined that role for all time.
Throughout this film, I found myself reciting the lines along with the actors, so close was the film to the book (the scene with Jacob Marley's ghost is one good example). I was also genuinely moved by the portrayals, who surely brought Dickens' 1846 novel to life and conveyed Dickens' intended message clearly and completely, as voiced by Nephew Fred: that ""Christmas is the time of year when all humans seem of one accord to open their shut-up hearts freely to their fellow creatures, and see them not as other races off on other journies, but as fellow passengers to the grave.""
The film was shot in an English town in winter, and the street scenes, authentic costumes and English accents add much to credibility and enjoyment.

In addition, the casting, the acting, the directing and the musical score all add up to an unbeatable holiday experience.

727850,5,6303824358,"This 1984 version of the Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol,"" directed by Clive Donner, stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge.  By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film Donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it.  He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially Scott.  One could argue that the definitive portrayal of Scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction, ever-- was created by Alastair Sim in the 1951 film; but I think with his performance here, Scott has now achieved that distinction.  There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen Scott do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge.  And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous.  It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true.  It's a study in perfection.  The other members of the cast are splendid as well, but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of Scott's performance; and they do.  Frank Finlay is the Ghost of Jacob Marley; a notable turn, though not as memorable, perhaps, as the one by Alec Guinness (as Marley) in the film, ""Scrooge.""  Angela Pleasence is a welcome visage as the Spirit of Christmas Past; Edward Woodward, grand and boisterous, and altogether convincing as the Spirit of Christmas Present; and Michael Carter, grim and menacing as the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come.  David Warner hits just the right mark with his Bob Cratchit, bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by Scott's Scrooge, and Susannah York fares just as well as Mrs. Cratchit.  The real gem to be found here, though, is the performance of young Anthony Walters as Tiny Tim; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin, and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film.  The excellent supporting cast includes Roger Rees (Fred Holywell, and also the narrator of the film), Caroline Langrishe (Janet Holywell), Lucy Gutteridge (Belle), Michael Gough (Mr. Poole) and Joanne Whalley (Fan).  A flawless presentation, this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever.  And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of George C. Scott.  A thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience, this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home.",977270400,11,3074,4.696461824953445
727851,4,6303824358,"Excellent production with uniformly fine performances. The only problem is the choice of George C. Scott for Scrooge. Although he is a superb actor and can play mean and crotchety as well as anyone, he is physically all wrong for the role. Scrooge should be wizened and shrivelled, whereas Scott exudes power and forcefulness. He does the best with what he has, giving a consistent reinterpretation of the part, but it is not the Scrooge we all know and love (to hate). Sometimes the difference is particullarly distracting, like when he bends his robust, healthy frame over his dinner of watery gruel. At the end, when we expect Scrooge to be bubbling over with uncontainable glee, Scott's performance is more restrained, especially in the scene with his nephew. Again, he is utterly believable and self-consistent, but it does not offer the joyous catharsis of more traditional portrayals. For that, I recommend the 1951 version with Alistair Sim, or the musical ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney.",976838400,2,994,5.067073170731708
727852,5,6303824358,"The celebrated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is the one starring Alastair Sim, who gives the definitive version of the traditional, crabbed miser performance of Scrooge. It indeed is very fine, but this version is better. It is probably the most faithful of all the screen ""Christmas Carols"" to the original Dickens story. It pulses with color and life, and the ancient Midlands town of Shrewsbury makes a delightful stand-in for 19th-century London. But what really makes this version unforgettable is the superb, surprising casting, beginning with George C. Scott as Scrooge. Scott plays Scrooge not as a crabbed old coot, but as a man whose imposing, smug facade masks enormous sorrow and insecurity--a man who suffered greatly, lost his way because of it, and needs to find that way again. It is a brilliant performance, and the supporting players shine like rubies: Frank Finlay as a truly terrifying Marley's Ghost; ""Tom Jones"" co-stars David Warner and Susannah York as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit; Edward Woodward, taking time out from ""The Equalizer"" to make a delightful Ghost of Christmas Present. This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" remembers that the story is, first and foremost, a ghost story; when the Ghost of Christmas Present reveals Ignorance and Want to Scrooge, every viewer will be thoroughly unnerved, and thoroughly moved. The terror, of course, is all the better to appreciate the abundant joy with which the story ends.

But few of them seem to have the care and attention paid to it as this version directed by Clive Donner and starring George C. Scott as Scrooge.  The details in this production are amazing.  For example, Tiny Tim actually looks ill and is not the overly-healthy looking lad of previous versions.  Scott anchors this film with an amazingly well-rounded portrayal of Scrooge.  He shows wit, fear, insight, and even humor in his portrayal, while fleshing out the character.  Scrooge is seen as a fully realized character, and not the stereotype we often think of.  Scott is also supported by top notch talent, with Edward Woodward's Ghost of Christmas Present, David Warner's Bob Cratchit, Susannah York's Mrs. Cratchit, and Frank Finlay's Marley especially praised.  But there is NOT ONE weak portrayal in the entire film, and that is a rare thing indeed.  If you have to get only one version of this time-honored story, I would heartily recommend this one above all.  It reminds us that Dickens' story is a classic for our time...and all time as well.

The only one I haven't seen yet is the one starring Patrick Stewart.
But Stewart's attempt would have to be above excellent to beat George C. Scott's marvelous turn as Ebenezer Scrooge.
I watched this movie when it first aired in 1984, and I looked forward to it every year since then. There were some years when it didn't air, and I would be absolutely crestfallen. But one day I walked into my local Wal-mart and there it was after all these years! I snapped it up immediately.
Sorry to all the Reginald Owens and Alistair Sim fans out there, but George C. Scott does it best in my opinion. I will watch the other versions if they come on in my area, but I usually fall asleep or struggle through them. I can watch Scott's versions over and over again throughout the season and never get tired of it. It tops the list of my live-action Christmas movie favorites.
It's hard for me to see why the critics rate the Sim version over this one. Donner's movie draws me in to the time and place. I feel as if I'm really there! The sets are lush, the costumes beautiful, and actors superb. This movie has just the right amount of darkness and haunting needed so that the change in Scrooge and the lightness that follows is so welcome. It's also the most faithful to Charles Dickens' book, which I like to read as a companion to the movie.
Despite what the critics say about this version, I hardly notice that Scott doesn't have a convincing British accent. There's so many other things that are so right about this production, and Scott's performance is so convincing, that's it's hard to take points off for the few things that might be subpar.

This version, originally broadcast in the mid-1980's, is probably the closest I've seen to the original book. Scott's Scrooge is at once arrogant and sorrowful.

Roger Rees is simply outstanding as Scrooge's loving and caring  nephew, Fred Holywell, and their scenes together after Scrooge's redemption  has firmly taken hold are beautiful and tear-inducing.  Edward Woodward's  Ghost of Christmas Present is fabulous, and he more than holds his own in  his scenes with Scott.

Warning: make sure  you watch this version (or any version) BEFORE the Sim version or, alas, it  will seem small and puny in comparison and you will be unable to look at  the Scott version as anything more than a cheap imitation, which it is not.",945907200,,825,4.417218543046357
727908,5,6303824358,The Alastair Sim version was very good but this is better. The late George C Scott is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent. The film boasts that rare combination - careful  attention to Period  detail and an engrossing storyline that remains  faithful to the original novel.  The penultimate scene when Scrooge is  reconciled to his nephew [ Roger Rees ] is particularly moving. You'll be  lucky to sit through this one without recourse to a box of hankies!,945734400,2,499,4.951807228915663
727939,5,6303824358,"This is simply the best version ever filmed of Charles Dicken's classic tale!  George C. Scott captures so completely and believably the character of Ebenezer Scrooge.  He is amazing. The supporting cast is magnificent to  the last.  Their characterizations are so real and touching.  It is  beautifully and meticulously acted and filmed, with great attention to  every detail. And the music is, well, in a word magical!  It transports you  and captures so finely the pure essence of Dickensian England. Try this one  for yourself.  I am moved and captured by it's brilliance every time that I  see it.  In this version the tale's timless message isn't just told, it is  astoundingly revealed!",945216000,4,693,5.017699115044247
727940,4,6303824358,"A beautiful adaptation of Dickens' best known work.  Beautifully shot and subtly acted, this version is terribly underrated.  Probably the most faithful to the original novel.  Every generation has its own  ""Christmas Carol"" and for me it was this.  Scott and Rees (best  known as Robin Colcourt from ""Cheers"") are wonderful!",944611200,6,325,5.2745098039215685
727941,5,6303824358,"After reading the original, the then currently available movie versions of this classic were, in my humble opinion, sadly lacking. Then I got one of the best Christmas presents ever, a new release of 'A Christmas Carol'  starring none other than George C. Scott. I immediately felt his  interpretation of the Dicken's character was much more 'real' than any  other I had seen, plus, the supporting cast, cinematography, direction and  sets were absolutely first class. What a special treat for anyone who loved  the book. One of my absolute favorite movies of all time without question.",944524800,6,586,5.0625
727942,5,6303824358,"For many many years I have been a fan of A Christmas Carol.  For most of these many many years the version starring Reginald Owen was my favorite.  O.K., so my real favorite was the Mr. Magoo version - but who wants to  admit that in public?  After viewing George C. Scott as Scrooge, I cannot  envision anyone else as Scrooge.  Sorry Reginald!",943488000,7,344,4.380952380952381
727943,5,6303824358,"In my opinion, this is the best adaptation of Dicken's A Christmas Carol. George C. Scott is the perfect Scrooge, and this is a movie for all ages. The slight deviations from the story are necessary to bring it to film, and  I think it even enhances the story line. The ending always brings moist  eyes, and the story is so refreshing. This is the best Christmas movie ever  made.",939600000,,380,4.4

7853868,3,6303824358,"After watching THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS, I am even more a fan of A CHRISTMAS CAROL than ever. I ordered two versions that I had never seen - this one and the Patrick Stewart version. The reviews for this one are glowing, but I was underwhelmed - I thought Scott played him too laid back and so his redemption doesn't make you feel elated. But to each his own. My favorite Scrooge is Michael Caine in the Muppet version. He is an actor of great skill, so you feel the meanness, the anger, the fear, the remorse, the sadness and the joy along with him. Plus you get the fun of the Muppets and their music so that even a child can watch most of it with you. This version even warns the child when the Ghost of Christmas Future comes into the story and Gonzo and Rizzo can't watch since it is scary. SCROOGE, THE MUSICAL, with Albert Finney, is also excellent and the music sticks with you. The Disney Jim Carrey version is supposed to be the one closest to the book - which I read so long ago, I don't remember specifics - but I think I'll spring for a copy of the book. If you are a collector of Scrooges, I would highly recommend THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS, which is the story of how Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol. Christopher Plummer is the ghost of Scrooge and is excellent, as was the rest of the cast, the set and costumes. And you begin to understand where Dickens got his ideas, not just for this book but also others that woke up the British population about the hardships of childhood and the poor..",1523664000,,1518,4.274305555555555
