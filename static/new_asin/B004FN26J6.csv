8428063,5,B004FN26J6,"This DVD provided very interesting insights into a baby's development. It also reinforced that all baby's develop in their own unique way on their own timeline. I also found the science/research to be very well presented, perhaps a bit dated, but still applicable today (at least to my baby). This does not cover nuances of babies with special needs.",1491782400,,350,4.9491525423728815
8428064,5,B004FN26J6,Really cool video.  The vendor was prompt. I like.,1444348800,,50,4.555555555555555
8428065,3,B004FN26J6,"Wasn't all that interesting. We watched it once and then donated it to our local library. Hopefully the library patrons and anyone who buys this will find it more riveting. There were a few interesting facts, but it just didn't do anything for us. Not w",1409616000,,253,4.521739130434782

8428067,5,B004FN26J6,I teach child development courses at a community college. This is a wonderful resource for me to share with my students. They love the information and the beautiful babies.,1384300800,,172,4.9655172413793105
8428068,5,B004FN26J6,This is a great video for what babies are doing development wise in their first year of life. I show this video to both my human development and child development classes when we talk about infant development. It is a great primer for what we are going to be talking about.,1381190400,,273,4.372549019607843
8428069,2,B004FN26J6,"this had some good information that i found quite interesting as i watch my own infant grow. but why on earth did nat geo decide on the moody music, grainy lab video, and dark imagery? im not saying that it needed to be all teddy bears and rainbows, but its obvious that the producers wanted an eerie mood that felt very out of place for the subject matter.",1376870400,,357,4.264705882352941
8428070,5,B004FN26J6,I'm using this as a resource in my Child Development course for Early Childhood Education students.  Wonderful info on research studies and the amazing skills of babies!,1361577600,8,169,5.2592592592592595
8428071,3,B004FN26J6,"Okay, the information in this is very interesting. But why is the music so creepy? I mean come on! I'm trying to watch this with my spouse, we were all excited about thinking about a cute baby, but the music frequently (but thankfully not always) sounds like something out of a ""History"" Channel-style alien freak show. And then there are the constant scenes of babies left alone in dark rooms or dark stages, and wires strapped to their heads. Sure, it's science, but couldn't there be a less creepy way to present this?",1343433600,6,521,4.612903225806452
8428072,5,B004FN26J6,"I wish I'd watched this while my kids were infants - and i also wish I could have watched this with my children as an alternative to so much of the junk passed off as ""kids' movies"". This one is a true gem and the perfect way to spend the better part of an hour.

This film, short as it is (52 minutes) went beyond any of the many books and videos on infant development I'd read or watched before. It included some of the newest research. My spouse and I were riveted by the thoroughly engaging babies,  from their first fragile moments of birth to their eventual tottering  steps.

 Along the way, we discovered  so many intriguing facts :  why some of the first instinctive reflexes exist but are temporary, why taking that first breath is so difficult, and how neural pathways associated with learning can be helped or hindered.

There were also some fascinating and suspenseful real-life dramas, actual parents whose babies faced severe challenges. I won't add spoilers except to add that none of these dramatic moments have outcomes that would keep The Science of Babies from being a family film. The film is probably too complex to hold the attention of preschoolers and other very young children but it is a superb choice for those old enough to watch relatively short documentaries.",1341792000,6,1290,4.676991150442478
