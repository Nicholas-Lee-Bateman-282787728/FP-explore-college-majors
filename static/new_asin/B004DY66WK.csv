""Veer-Zaara"" is an epic love story, one which transcends borders real and imagined, and the message that true, abiding love will eventually overcome all obstacles is powerfully presented here. The story begins in Lahore, Pakistan where an idealistic young female lawyer, Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherjee) seeks her late father's blessings (at his grave) as she prepares to take on her first human rights case, that involving the unjust long-term imprisonment of an Indian national, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan). Veer was accused over 20 years ago of being an Indian spy, Rathod, and was found guilty and imprisoned ever since.

As Saamiya eventually draws Veer out of his self-imposed silence, she learns about the love story that has inspired this silence - one which takes viewers via flashback to 22 years
earlier. Bollywood superstars Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini make appearances and beautiful Preity Zinta plays an important role as well.

The songs are beautiful, and the cinematography conveys all the vibrant colors of the Indian countryside. The theme song is one that I fell in love with, and I plan on obtaining the soundtrack. Shah Rukh Khan plays his role flawlessly, there is no exaggeration here - and I particularly liked the final scene where Veer reads a heartrending poem he composed as he addresses the court. Preity Zinta is beautiful and delivers a credible performance as a woman torn between doing her duty to her family and listening to her heart, and the courage she displays in choosing her own destiny. This is one of the most beautiful love stories to come out of Bollywood in recent years, and I heartily recommend it.

Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
""In life we make some relationships, and some are made by God..."" so says the father of the lead actress in this delightful musical on his death bed, and this also forms the central theme in the movie. Humble and unassuming Surinder Sahni (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan) is attending his former professor's daughter's wedding when tragedy strikes. The bride-to-be's fiance dies in an accident and the professor suffers a heart attack. On his death bed, the professor pleads with Surinder to marry his young daughter Taani (newcomer Anushka Sharma) as he fears for her future. Surinder who has already fallen in love with Taani at first sight, agrees and Taani too agrees as a means of placating her father, who dies soon after.

The wedded couple arrive in Amritsar where Surinder works for a utility company, Punjab Power. Taani is initially in a deep state of grieving but she soon rouses herself, though she makes it plain that she has no love left to give, and will be a good wife (but not a 'real' wife, the couple sleep in separate quarters).Taani develops an interest in a dance competition and once Surinder gives the OK, she begins lessons which leads Surinder to come up with a plan - he'll transform himself into Raj, a cool and carefree guy who will go watch Taani dance without her knowledge. But events take a dramatic turn when Raj aka Surinder finds himself being partnered with Taani in the dance competition, throwing them into close contact. This being a Bollywood drama, romantic complications ensue, leaving Surinder pondering on the wisdom of his double act.

Shah Rukh Khan or SRK is amazing as the unassuming Surinder, and this unglamorous role showcases his acting repertoire (though he has done other low-key roles before). Of course, the viewer needs to suspend disbelief here as the transformation from Surinder to Raj is not very dramatic, and one can't help wondering how Taani can't seem to recognize Raj as her own husband Surinder. The only explanation I came up with which seems plausible is the fact that Taani, being in her own world most of the time (thinking of the past, coping with her grief and sadness) does not really 'see' her husband, even when interacting with him, but clearly 'sees' Raj and gravitates to his unique brand of humor and spirited gestures. Anushka Sharma holds her own against veteran actor SRK and seems genuinely at ease in her role, and it helps that the lead pair share credible chemistry.

The songs are incredibly catchy and are definitely one of the highlights of the movie - look out for a medley scene where there are cameos by some of Bollywood's leading ladies such as Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukherjee. They sing and dance with SRK to a medley of Hindi songs from classic Hindi movies of yesteryears which were truly entertaining. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the scenes set around the Golden Temple at Amritsar, which is one of the most sacred shrines and places of worship for the Sikhs. This is a light-hearted movie that will have viewers smiling, and enjoying the catchy beats, and the delightful performances by the leads. Recommended!",1371600000,,4900,4.9034981905910735
8426356,5,B004DY66WK,"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is my #1 favorite, because the story is compelling on a human level, the dancing and the music are fantastic, and the characters are sincere and endearing.  No over-the-top violence, no family conflicts or subterfuge--just good intentions, good friends, and unrequited love.  So what if it's corny as hell and the ending is predictable--who cares, when the story is told so well?  I've seen it several times since I bought it, and I'm learning some of the songs!

Veer-Zaara is heartbreakingly beautiful, the music is sweeping.  The serious political themes are a bit heavy-handed, which makes the love story verge on melodrama, but the main characters are so involving and decent, and they get to have some lighter moments to break up the more oppressive ones.  Well told, well-acted.  I love this movie.",1358380800,,825,4.934782608695652
