8744994,1,B019EMPBFS,Not a good movie Son stop watching:-(,1526688000,,37,4.428571428571429
8744995,2,B019EMPBFS,The cover and the title itself is misleading. The pink rabbit plays a very small role. The movie was fine but I didn't get what I thought I was getting. I think my s7 y.o. would have been more interested if the pink rabbit played a larger role.,1466380800,,244,4.104166666666667
8744996,5,B019EMPBFS,My 3yr and 7yr old nieces love it. I've lost count of how many times they've watched it.,1464393600,,88,3.9444444444444446
