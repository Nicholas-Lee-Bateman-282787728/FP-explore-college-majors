6330129,3,B00J3CQGPE,The movie was only good because it had Jessica Morris in it. I have no idea why they put Judd Nelsons name on this he is only in a few scenes.,1439337600,,142,3.6129032258064515
6330130,5,B00J3CQGPE,A movie that is scary and sensual.,1425859200,,34,4.0
6330131,3,B00J3CQGPE,"Tom (Rib Hillis) has everything: A beautiful lily white wife (Jessica Morris), a wonderful son (Dane Hillis) a great job as a successful architect and an assistant (Mariah Bonner) with benefits. When his wife is raped in the first scene, the family must get away to her home town of Thornby where they stay with her dad (Neil Dickson). The town is a bit odd and the women are overly flirty with both Tom and Brenda, his wife.

Brenda discovers her Viking/Norse/rune magic/witchcraft roots as the film PLOT SPOILER becomes eerily similar to ""Harvest Home.""

The film suffered from several problems. First and foremost was that it dragged. Things moved very slowly to get us to a climax, where the audience is half asleep, just waiting for the film to end. The acting wasn't that great. The dialogue needed some zip. The film was a good idea, at least when Thomas Tryon wrote it, however it failed to keep people engaged. The nude scenes were all end loaded too. If you are going to use nudity to spur interest, they need to be spread out. 2 1/2 stars

6330133,2,B00J3CQGPE,"I originally purchased this movie because Jessica Morris was one of the stars.  I think that she is a very underrated and underused actress, but even she wasn't enough to save this movie.  The storyline really did not connect well at all.  Also, the character of the mysterious woman was very poorly developed.  Has Judd Nelson's career sunk this low?  I gave it two stars, but it probably only deserves 1.5.",1405987200,4,408,4.690140845070423

6330168,2,B00J3CQGPE,"I did not hate it -- I've seen worse; but I did not like it either.  The ending was a flop.  Too many holes in the plot -- not enough information to give you a clear understanding of what or why things are happening.  (spoiler) So if Brenda killed her own mother, as her son just killed his own father, and the family bloodline is through Brenda's Dad, why did the witch give the book to Brenda's mother and teach her how to read it?  Are we to assume Brenda's mother willingly agreed to be killed by her daughter?  If she did, why did she -- we are never really told why a sacrifice is needed.

Just imagine taking the entire History of the Roman Empire and condensing it down to a few names -- Octavius; Portia; Pompei; Julius; Claudius and Niro but not giving you any information as to who they were, what they did, and when they existed.  This is how lost and vague this movie is.

I am an old gal now and the only thing that gets stimulated in me, at this point, is my mind; so tits and ass just doesn't cut it any more.  I've been alive too long and seen so much of that, it's pretty much -- in a word -- BORING.

8647685,4,B00J3CQGPE,"I'm not a fan of horror movies that show nothing but weird spooky scenes with no storyline explanation behind anything we see until later in the film.  Feels like a bunch of random nonsense that only makes sense when the movie reaches the final 20 minutes.  In this case, with Haunting of the Innocent, things don't even make sense at the end!  The movie also relies on jump scares.  Granted the Haunting of the Innocent does give us a little bit of story progression as the movie goes along, but not enough to make sense of the things we see happening.  At least not total sense- we can guess of course.

My review contains a bunch of SPOILERS, so please don't read my review until you first watch the movie.

We see a woman played by Jessica Morris return home after a morning jog and appears to be getting raped, however the man disappears or runs away and we now see Jessica lying on the floor so it almost appears like this rape didn't happen and the woman is traumatically remembering/reenacting being raped at an earlier time.  Then we see a business meeting with a man (Rib Hillis) and his secretary who's a *horrible* actress.  I mean really bad, haha.  Her phony desire to be sexually alluring is painful to watch!  Is she even paying attention to her job at all?  Rib gets a phone call, rushes to the hospital while the beat from Paul McCartney's ""Silly Love Song"" plays and... he hesitates to open the door to the one hospital room.  Why I wonder?  We find out the woman we see being raped and this business guy are actually husband and wife.

So Jessica and Rib grab their kid and they all drive out to the desert to visit the wife's father (Neil Dickson).  Jessica and Rib play the blame game over her rape.  Had the husband been home at the time it never would've happened.  While visiting Jessica's mom's tombstone, now things get weird.  She gets an unexpected surprise by a woman (Hannah Cowley's character) who knew her mom.  She drops something on mom's grave that indicates a safe journey.  When Jessica turns around the woman's gone!  Was she real or a hallucinating image?

While Rib takes his son to a restaurant, a man drinking coffee tries to talk to them but ends up spitting up his coffee so they have to leave.  I guess he disturbed the father/son bonding moment.  Meanwhile Jessica is roaming around the house.  Hannah appears outside snooping around watching Jessica.  Rib tells his son they have to look after Jessica due to the accident she had a month ago.  Jessica talks to her father about her seeing strange things but can't explain them.  I think the father knows what she's seeing but won't say yet.

The boy draws pictures and tells his father about a magic book grandpa gave him.  Rib walks outside, sees something oozing from the ground in a hole near a tree and a bunch of crows fly out.  He's then overwhelmed by screams.  Looks like the wife isn't the only one hallucinating!  Rib tries to crawl away since this ordeal was so traumatic, and luckily Jessica and Neil come to his rescue.  He's okay- he just needed his beauty rest while a crow watches him from the bedroom windowsill.  Jessica and her father talk about the woman she saw at the graveyard.  He confirms she was close to Jessica's mother.

A horrible jump scare when the boy questions what's outside his window and a bird flies into it.  Meanwhile Neil wakes up when he hears voices and carves something into the wall nearby.  Jessica sneaks around the house uncovering letters that her mother wrote.  They mention the mother wanting to know about her daughter, but it's hard to hear what's written in the letter since Jessica's crying and not speaking clear enough.  Jessica has a dream she's being visited by Hannah, and she whispers something spooky to Jessica.  Hilarious when Jessica wakes up confused, the husband says ""good morning"" and she turns and goes ballistic slapping him!  The husband's like ""Not again!""

While driving in town Rib drops his wife off so she can visit a flowershop.  She's drawn there for some reason.  The only cliched moment of the movie is when the wife looks at the flowers and... the woman from the graveyard (Hannah) works here.  This woman's everywhere!  While shopping the husband gets a visit from... the same woman at the flowershop?  Someone else who resembles Hannah?  I don't know!  Again, she's everywhere!  The two women look the same but have different voices.  Anyway she's happy Rib is here.

Anyway Jessica and this woman discuss their mother and the flowershop.  Jessica questions why mom never mentioned Hannah's character.  The music gets eerie so we know something is up about this woman.  Jessica hallucinates and thinks her hands are covered in blood.  Back home grandpa and the boy walk around in the woods talking about being part of a Viking family.  They talk about the Vikings lack of exploring and how they succumbed to diseases, but used their love and closeness of family to survive.  Meanwhile Jessica and Hannah discuss colonies and witches many years ago.  A warrior guided the colonies through.  Then the warrior and witch got into a slow fight, and the witch ultimately stabbed him to death.  He never received a proper Viking funeral so he cursed the land.  The witch was wounded in the fight and died by a nearby tree where she was buried.  Everyone under her spell was now free.

The two women talk about the magic books Jessica found in the bedroom.  Hannah offers to teach magic to Jessica and she accepts.  Hannah wraps a symbol around Jessica's neck and thanks her for coming home... but Jessica doesn't hear that last comment!  She's out the door by then.  Meanwhile grandpa and the boy look over family photos.  The boy recognizes a picture in the photo album.  It's someone he designed in one of his drawings.  It's Hannah from the flowershop that Jessica has been seeing.  Jessica comes home and needs a nap.  Grandpa and Rib get into an argument.  Rib explains Jessica needs help for her problems, but grandpa tells him to stop whining and fix the marriage for his daughter.  Grandpa takes the son and goes somewhere to spend the night.

The boy questions if his father's getting a divorce before walking out the door with grandpa.  Meanwhile Rib spots the carvings on the wall from grandpa.  Remember that night he woke up and carved something into the wall?  Yeah, that.  Rib wakes up Jessica and they get into a fight.  Now the story gets weird.  Rib thinks he's that warrior from old times.  Apparently the warrior's haunting the husband.  Rib goes crazy strangling and doing his wife on the floor.  Okay this scene explains why HE'S being tormented.  Now Jessica explains the rape and strangling from earlier in the movie... and she felt... good about it.  Wow!  Is she serious or just angry?  She mentions she can't be fixed since her mind's a wreck.

Emotionally distraught Jessica drives to the flowershop and visits Hannah to talk.  Jessica can't open up and say what happened.  They discuss the magic book.  Hannah mentions the mother was eager to learn things from the book and was taught many things such as worship and... love.  Hannah and Jessica then make out.  Meanwhile at home Rib's asleep and dreams he's walking through the woods late at night making out and doing Hannah.  This HAS to be a dream since Hannah can't be two places at once!  When Hannah kisses Rib she says something in a demonic voice but I can't make out what it is.  Jessica wakes up and the woman says ""Now do you see?""  Jessica says yes but... I don't see!  Well I certainly see *something* I like but ahem, I'm getting sidetracked here!

At home Rib cuts his chest open and lets the blood drip on the floor as his warrior personality takes hold.  He walks outside and digs a hole next to that tree that gave him grief earlier with the crows flying out of it.  When his chest blood touches the dirt he digs up a skull with his hands.  Rib pours gas over the skull, stabs it and it explodes in a really FAKE looking explosion.  The son is now home apparently since he smells something burning.  He walks outside and... yeah, he's home, since grandpa's here too.  Grandpa runs outside, sees the hole burning, looks for the boy, runs inside and finds the boy sleeping happily in bed.

Jessica comes home... with her new lover (Hannah) and she... kisses grandpa!  Wow Hannah's going around just kissing everyone isn't she?  In dreams and in real life!  She asks where Rib is.  Uh, he's out back burning into the ground even though grandpa somehow didn't see him during his quest to find the boy... but wait, no he's not!  Rib's actually driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and heading back to the city to attend a business meeting.  He's trying to become an architect in LA.  That secretary with the poor acting returns and also attends the meeting.

Of course Rib takes advantage of the secretary because it's *very obvious* she's luring him in sexually.  This sexual matter should've been addressed in the beginning of the film before all that mess with his wife, but whatever!  The secretary freaks out when she sees all the blood marks on his chest.  Suddenly she gets really upset and this affects her acting -it makes it a lot better!  Rib gets a phone call from his son that he needs him, but the secretary reminds Rib that if he doesn't sleep with her, he can kiss the sexual encounters and his business goodbye.  She ain't my type, so I'd be out of there instantly!

When Rib drives home grandpa informs him that Hannah took Jessica and their son to the graveyard to have a sacrifice.  When Rib arrives Hannah kisses him in front of his wife and kid.  Rib remembers his warrior ways with his newfound demonic voice, and begs that Jessica doesn't stab him.  But the demonic voices only grow bigger.  Hannah's speaking like a demon too, as she continues the sacrifice.  Oh no!  Jessica holds a knife up to the boys throat.  *feels relief* she doesn't stab her own son.  Instead she hands the boy the knife so he can stab his father.  That's... not better!  Rib remembers more from his warrior years and how his own wife stabbed him, hence the blood on her hands.

A man that looks like Marilyn Manson appears to Rib after all the memories come flooding back.  Hannah drinks Rib's blood, turns to the son and says in time she will give the spirit to him.  Not if the boy grows up and lives far away from here!  Rib lies on the ground as the crow flies.  The end.

Well then!  I couldn't understand the story.  It was too complex and confusing for its own good.  WAY too complex and confusing for its own good, haha.  I guess the husband, wife and son all return to grandpa's home so this magical woman can free the spirits and infect the family, turning the husband into a warrior and the wife into a witch.  I give the movie 4 stars because it turned out to be more interesting than it seemed in the beginning.  You might call Haunting of the Innocent confusing, but you can't say it was boring.  The movie actually does try to tell a really good story after all instead of, in the beginning, what appears to be false promises with constant jump scares and weird segments that don't make sense.  So I applaud the writers for that.",1497052800,,11214,4.574811083123426

They're all the same. No atmosphere. No story. No skill. No nothing. Just a rip-off... of your Prime membership fee and your precious time. This one wasn't even memorable enough for me to pick on anything specific, just people wandering around flaunting their lame acting skills as things you don't understand happen to people you could care less about for reasons unknown. Tedious!",1488153600,4,558,4.88421052631579

I started watching because I couldn't remember seeing it before,  but after the first 10 minutes or so, I couldn't wait to turn it off!!!!!",1476230400,,284,4.6

The acting was good but with how stupid the movie was it didn't matter too much.  Run, run very fast away from  this movie!!!  Sad cause it could have been a good movie under different circumstances.",1474070400,3,313,4.4035087719298245

I hadn't seen Judd Nelson in years, so I figured the film had to be at least mediocre. Judd Nelson plays a four-line inconsequential character. The movie producers simply wanted to use his name since the film script and cinematography are absolutely crap.",1473984000,7,395,4.91044776119403
