1983292,5,B0001ADAOW,This DVD is absolutely lovely.  My 3-year old adores it.  There are no scary scenes and nothing indecent for toddlers.  I highly recommend this to other families out there everywhere.,1255046400,2,183,5.033333333333333
1983293,5,B0001ADAOW,My son loved this one as well.  Water play is always interesting to kids.  My son watches this one for several runs too.  He loves Kipper with his umbrella.  It is definitely a must for Kipper fans.,1206230400,,198,4.27027027027027
1983294,1,B0001ADAOW,"These are the episodes;

The umbrella (in ""Visitor and other stories"")

The seaside ( in ""Visitor and other stories"")

The rainbow puddle (in ""Pig's present and other stories"")

The paddling pool( in ""Snowy day and other stories)

Big owl's bath

My son is a Kipper's big fan and has almost all VHSs. If you have other tapes above, the last one episode would be new. And this tape has a bothering caption at the bottom of the screen all the time saying, ""for screening purpose only! exclusive oroperty of HIT."" Stories themselves are good.",1144368000,5,539,4.680851063829787
1983295,5,B0001ADAOW,"This was the first Kipper DVD I bought for my son. It is still his favourite. He will choose this over an above all the other Kipper videos he owns. His favourite episode is the first one, The Umbrella, in which Kipper takes an amazing journey with an umbrella. Yes, it is short, but I felt it was a good length for a child's attention span. Also, it is very quiet and low-key, which is sometimes a very good thing. It makes an excellent just-before-bedtime video.",1107475200,11,464,4.406976744186046
1983296,3,B0001ADAOW,"I didn't buy this at first because I was of the impression that it was a compilation of water episodes from the other DVDs.  We own most, if not all, of the other DVDs and I can't say that I've seen any of the episodes before.  They may have been shown on TV, or may have been on the earlier VHS tapes, but nevertheless they were all new to me.

This one is very short at five episodes, not the length of the usual Kipper value packs, and the biggest problem is that Pig and Arnold are missing.  Gotta have those pigs!

The five episodes are imaginative as usual, including a talking magic frog and an elephant, plus Kipper does a great Gene Kelly/Mary Poppins impression on an umbrella adventure.

Not the best Kipper to start with, but reasonable entertainment for seasoned veterans.

1983297,1,B0001ADAOW,Our family has all of the Kipper videos and we have always loved them.  We were excited to see a new edition but were very disappointed upon reciept when we realized that all but 1 of the stories on this DVD was on previous DVD's.  If they are going to do a compilation DVD it should be advertised as such.  We felt very cheated since for the money we paid we only got one new episode.,1082419200,27,385,4.0394736842105265
1983298,4,B0001ADAOW,"I have to say that I enjoy all the Kipper videos and this one is no exception.  I have a 3 year old daughter who delights in watching Kipper and Tiger's antics in this particular DVD.
One great thing about Kipper videos is that they aren't full of violence and instead are low-key and show Kipper working out problems or learning new things.  That is a rare find in the selection of ""children's"" videos.",1081987200,11,403,4.4324324324324325
1983299,2,B0001ADAOW,"We have all the Kipper movies and this one is disappointing.  First of all, it's full price for only 5 stories compared to the usual 7 or 8, Secondly, Pig and Arnold aren't on any of the stories.  If this was the first Kipper DVD for us to see, I wouldn't buy any more.  Fortunately we have the others and they're pretty good.",1081900800,11,326,4.142857142857143
