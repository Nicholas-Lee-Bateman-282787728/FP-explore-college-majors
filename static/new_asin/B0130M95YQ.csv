7359873,5,B0130M95YQ,"Bloodline was an amazing show to binge watch when it debuted on Netflix. The intentional fractured story structure is part of why this show was such an intense and intriguing show to binge. You almost feel like a detective trying to piece together the haunted past of this big family. The Rayburns run a Bed and Breakfast out of the Florida Keys, their grown children all have their own lives and issues to deal with. When the oldest estranged brother comes back for a family reunion, his emotional baggage comes with him and threatens to tear down the rest of the families lives. Saying anymore would really ruin the viewing experience so I apologize if this review seems rather vague, I don't want to spoil anything.

Ive read complaints about the middle of the season dragging, or people being confused by the structure in the first few episodes, or by the twist ending. I didn't take issues with any of those things, this is a show you have to pay attention to, and how could you not? Its so damn engaging and intriguing, and piecing together story elements before they're revealed on the show is part of the fun. What shines the most about this show is the characters and the actors who play them. Ive always liked Kyle Chandler (King Kong, Friday Night Lights) but he just hits his performance as John Rayburn out of the park. Ben Mendelsohn (Quigley Down Under, Killing Them Softly) is a power house, he plays one of the most sympathetic and complex characters Ive ever seen on a T.V. show. Linda Cardellini (Freaks and Geeks, Grandmas Boy), Norbert Leo Butz, Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard, Jacinda Barrett and Chloe Sevigny all round out a stellar cast. While some of these actors are a bit underused, they all shine, however large or brief their roles are.

If you want to watch a character drama with relatable characters, a gorgeous Florida location that is a character in its own right, a story with twists and turns (some predictable, some not) then this is a show to watch. If Kyle Chandler or Ben Mendelsohn are not nominated for any awards this season, then they will have been robbed. The performances in Bloodline are very comparable to Breaking Bad, so if there is a void in your life since that show ended, Bloodline is the perfect show to fill that void. Bloodline comes FULLY APPROVED.",1438819200,37,2303,4.656019656019656
7359874,1,B0130M95YQ,"I am honestly not sure why people rated this series so high. I watched the first SIX episodes on Netflix and still can't get into it. I keep hearing that yes it drags at first, but then it gets really good. But in my opinion, if after SIX episodes your story is STILL BORING, then it has failed as a story and not worth all the accolades.
The characters are well fleshed out and the acting is superb. The problem come from the writing. Not at all with dialogue, but rather plot, meaning there isn't one, or they take forever to get to one. The plot is so poor that the writers resort to constant flashbacks, delusions, and flash forwards to try and hold your attention. All these characters do is whine, drink, smoke and cuss.
Perhaps something amazing happens after episode six and the series launches into greatness, but for now, I just can't invest anymore time to find out.",1497052800,2,877,4.453416149068323
7359875,4,B0130M95YQ,"Reminds of both the best and worst things about living in the Keys. Ben Mendelsohn must have spent a lot of time studying the underbelly characters that reside in the Keys, he absolutely nailed the part. At first the show felt like someone was trying to tell a story but kept getting sidetracked, my brain was screaming, ""get to the point already"" but it got better.

A note to the director(s), enough already with the shaky camera gimmick. Seriously, it gives me a headache. Aside from that some pretty neat camera angles, quite often it seems like I'm hiding out of view spying and eavesdropping on the characters.",1484265600,,616,4.703703703703703
7359876,4,B0130M95YQ,"I perused the reviews of this show on Amazon. Even though we're all reviewing on Amazon, I assume everyone watched thru Netflix, since it's not available yet on Amazon. Wish it were! I streamed on Netflix, and kept trying to go to the X-Ray features that Amazon offers (I watch a lot of shows on Amazon, it's my favorite for streaming). X-Ray helps me keep characters straight in shows like this, with an ensemble cast, when I get confused about who's who. Anyway, I agree with every comment I've read so far in the reviews, good and bad. Of course most are good, and rightly so. I especially concur with the ones about the wonderful setting, including the Florida scenery, and the phenomenal acting of Ben Mendelsohn. I could say more good things, but I'd they'd be redundant with, and maybe not expressed as well as, what others have written. But I will point out few problems. One is that an exceptional show like this should have exceptional casting. As most of us know from high school biology, two blue-eyed parents can't have a brown-eyed child. Blue contacts anyone? Also, there was a seen with Danny doing some chef-level chopping of vegetables, though the usually left-handed character suddenly became right-handed. Imagine there's a reason his face wasn't part of that film cut. Then, I'm pretty sure there is a legal inaccuracy having to do with estate law, but to explain would spoil. Maybe picky, but I expect total perfection from the team that brought us Damages!

As I write, I currently am on Season 2 Episode 3 and am continuing to binge watch. Show still going strong....",1474675200,,1591,4.743682310469314
7359877,4,B0130M95YQ,"Bloodline is a show with a lot of hype, some even compare it to Breaking Bad, so I decided to check it out.  It's definitely nothing like Breaking Bad, don't really get that comparison.  Bloodine is a show that's gets better on the final discs, if I was rating just the first couple of DVDs (there's five in the region 4 Season 1) I'd rate those three stars at the most.  They were pretty slow in much happening,it was sort of like a Florida version of The Bold with perfect on the outside public persona family members, having affairs, and doing other stuff that meant they were seriously flawed. They are also really into drinking, practically ever scene in every episode has someone either pouring from a bottle into a glass or just taking a swig straight from one. I began to wonder if this was a paid product placement for some particular beverage after a while. We also have a lot of flashbacks, some partial that get lengthened in future episode flashbacks, and the biggest annoyance of all, spoiler scenes for stuff that will happen in the final two episodes. They don't even make it vague, we don't know who the victim is, like the flashbacks we just get more and more lengthy replays of this throughout the episodes. There were also a lot of inconsistencies with characters, at one moment the youngest brother is trying to get everyone to think Dani was responsible for something he wasn't, the next he seems over it.  If I had just been watching this on TV, I likely would have stopped watching it after one or maybe two episodes, but since I had them all in this DVD case, and nothing much else to watch I kept watching.

If I was rating the last two DVDs or series one, I'd rate the show five stars.  It does get better.  The show does more or less wrap up all the major things happening by the end of Season 1, you could watch it as a standalone.  In fact I thought it was, just with an obvious teaser that there's something else to keep the story going at the end of the last episode.  Only coming on here to read where some people are talking about season 2 (and why do that on a season 1 DVD's product page?) that I now know there's a season 2.  I'm not sure I'll rush out to watch the second season but as I said the first season ends on a high enough quality that I'll be tempted to check it out one day.

I have to say though some aspects of this show's plot didn't make a lot of sense.  There's obvious spoilers if you haven't watched it yet if you continue to read on.  The most obvious not plausible plot hole was that revolving around the Will of the father.  He couldn't have left the resort to all his kids less Danny, since he only owned half of it, being he has been married to a wife (50 of which of those years the resort has been going for which she has been joint running if not being the primary runner of) who if they were to get divorced or he dies, already owns half of it.  They didn't die at the same time anyway.  Therefore even if he did give all of his half to his kids, she still owns the other half, can just adjust her Will to make up the shortfall to Danny when she dies anyway so he'll still end up with an equal share of the resort anyway.  Not to mention that changing a Will just before someone dies with an omission when the person filing (and signing) the Will or whatever is a beneficiary who gains from the omission wouldn't exactly be legal.

At one stage John goes undercover, now this is a small town where he is the main dealing with public spokesman for the town's most famous family, not to mention everyone in the town would know he's a cop, yet he goes undercover as a tourist fisherman into a shop.

We also have the drug investigation.  John as you would imagine is taken off the case since the drugs are on his family's land, yet somehow the guy who has announced he is marrying the daughter who has an equal share in that land somehow stays on the case.  He has just a big conflict of interest.  There's also other stuff like John discharges himself from the hospital and drives home, yet he was driven to the hospital and that car didn't stay there for obvious reasons.  But overall Bloodline Season 1 after a very slow start and in spite of the spoiler scenes (which were probably added to get viewers to keep watching), ends up being quite a good show.  Ben Mendelsohn does a great job as always at playing a guy constantly drunk or under the influence of some substance most of the time character.  It's interesting to see Linda Cardellini who played a teen in Freaks and Geeks now as a mother with teens of her own.  Worth checking out if you can get through the slow first episodes.  Really this series would have been better with less episodes and some culling through the editing process.",1472947200,,4761,4.3023516237402015

7359879,5,B0130M95YQ,"Amazing debut season for this show. It is definitely a slow burn and the intensity just gets better with each episode. I am a mega Kyle Chandler fan so I had to watch it! Definitely some of his best work and possibly one of the darkest characters he has ever portrayed. The character development is phenomenal and the family dynamic is anything but ""normal.""

Give this show a chance. Season two gets even more intense!",1469232000,,419,4.586666666666667
7359880,3,B0130M95YQ,"After finishing Season 1 - as well as Season 2 - of Bloodline, I am wondering if the Rayburn Family is the Raskolnikov Family of the Florida Keys?  Aside from its gratuitous and needless perversities, is Bloodline ultimately trying to provide an important moral message, like Crime and Punishment?

As per Wikepedia, Dostoyevsky's masterpiece ""Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, in attempts to defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them.""  The novel raises great questions about the role of conscience and the possibilities of confession / conversion / redemption.

Like Raskolnikov, will the Rayburns learn that they can only find peace when they acknowledge their sins?

6/3/17 ADDENDUM/SPOILER ALERT....

After finishing the third season, I would say that the Rayburns are very much the ""Raskolnikov"" Family of the Florida Keys.  Yet, only one character seems to presently be headed on the right road of owning up to that character's sins and redemption.",1465603200,,1422,5.2105263157894735
7359881,4,B0130M95YQ,I enjoyed Season 1 a lot and am now starting Season 2.  Interesting plot and solid acting and writing.,1464393600,,102,4.368421052631579
7359882,5,B0130M95YQ,Great show made by Netflix. Great acting. A show you want to just watch all at once. Such a great show with twist and turns and trying to figure out whats going on.. Cant wait for many more seasons of this netflix show!!,1459987200,2,220,4.1395348837209305
7359883,4,B0130M95YQ,"This Florida-keys set noir-ish study of a highly dysfunctional rich family started off like gangbusters.  Hidden murder, rich moral murkiness, characters hiding secrets, and terrific performances all around.  Ben Mendelsohn has gotten the lions share of attention among the cast, and not without reason.  His Danny is riveting and filled with fascinating contradictions  heartbreaking and scary, sexy and repellent. But the whole cast is working at a very high level, even if their characters aren't quite as showy.

However - for me - the show tailed off somewhat in the last third of the season, as plot lines and mysteries got more strung out, which lead to a feeling I was starting to get ahead of the red herrings, that there was a bit of marking time.  And then, oddly, the finale felt rushed through, and more intent on setting up the second season with a cliffhanger, then letting us really emotionally experience the end of this first part of the story.

Very good overall, and Ill be back for season 2, but this made me wish American cable TV was more willing to follow the European model, where - instead of having a pre-determined number of episodes to fill, each show does only as many episodes as needed to best tell that particular story.  In this case 6 or 8 episodes instead of 10 might have made for a classic, instead of a very good, season of television.",1457740800,5,1374,4.7196652719665275
7359884,5,B0130M95YQ,"Excellent first season of a family with serious issues.  Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny, the wayward brother, and totally carries the show.  I didn't realize what a great actor he is.  Will be interesting to see if Season 2 will be as good.",1456963200,2,236,4.571428571428571
7359885,3,B0130M95YQ,"There is a pretty good six hour mini series in this season one that runs about thirteen hours. The first four episodes especially drug on and on. It is as if the directors used every angle of the shots they needed to belabor the point that the characters are thinking. Sure the acting is adequate and the scenery is fine but I kept wanting to say ""We get it...next plot point please."". It feels to me like the creators watched a season of Ray Donavan and said ""I think we can do a thematically similar story but if we change the location and alter the characters a bit we can get the same feel"". Once the script was completed and they saw they only had abou six or seven episodes worth of material.....it was time to stretch it out with lingering camera shots, repeated clips of flashback moments, and lots and lots of characters drinking. If you thought Tony Soprano ate a lot during that series.....you are REALLY going to be distracted by the alcohol consumption in this show. I began to wonder while watching this if a person could hold their breath between moments when the characters were not drinking. These are the things that run through a person's mind when the pace drags. I enjoyed it nonetheless and maybe others feel the pendantic nature enhanced their viewing but for me if they would have edited it down a bit it would have been a solid four star.",1455408000,5,1363,4.477911646586345
7359886,5,B0130M95YQ,"I loved watching this series. Great acting with Kyle Chandler and Sissy Spacek. I'm looking forward to Season 2. There's the good, responsible, dependable brother, and then there's the irresponsible one. There's a family inn to run and taking care of it are the responsible and straight members (the good son and his mother (Sissy Spacek) and the father (Parenthood's Craig T. Nelson), and then along comes the black sheep of the family for a family reunion and he just keeps getting into trouble and creates more and more troubles for all the family members, as well. These are troubles of gigantic and sleazy proportions with the potential of damaging everyone in the family.",1451347200,,677,4.947368421052632
7359887,5,B0130M95YQ,Bloodline is lined with incredible acting. Every member of the cast and there are not that many outside the hotel owning family in Key Largo delivers great thespians. It would be so wrong to ruin the ending of Season One for those who have not watched this epic drama but suffice to say that I was a devoted fan of Heisenberg and the ending of Bloodline lines up with the quality of Breaking Bad's ending and that is one hell of a tall order. Can't wait for Season 2 to hit the airwaves....,1449705600,4,490,4.279569892473118
7359888,5,B0130M95YQ,"This show really grew on me. When I finished the first episode I thought it was a bit soap opera like and overly melodramatic. But I kept watching and it grabbed ahold of me after a few more episodes. Then I could not stop watching it. There are two characters who really made this for me. One is the actor playing the prodigal son. He did the best job of all. It was a very complex role which required the viewers to be torn over how they felt by him episode after episode. I went over to IMDB to read about this actor and discovered that on the international scene he is considered quite the power house actor. The second character is his sheriff brother. I have never seen this actor in anything before so I don't know how much of this was acting. But he was perfect as popular high school guy jock turned sheriff who is intent on ""doing his duty"" even though he tends to wear blinkers. He can be a bit of a block of wood but he's perfect at being that block of wood.

The rest of the cast flows around the tension between these two brothers. Some other reviewers are making the point that power house actors like Shepard, Spacek and Sevigny were underused. I was actually glad to experience two new to me actors to see what they could do in this. I already have been well exposed to the work of the other three. I really enjoyed it and binge watched it until done. There is a heck of a twist to this series and I just loved it.",1441584000,10,1431,4.166064981949458
7359889,4,B0130M95YQ,"The black sheep/prodigal son scenario is by no means a new subject for film or TV. The drama is inherent. So it comes down to how well the cards are played. These are played pretty darn well.

Here's he scoop. Maw and Paw Rayburn (Sam Shepard and Sissy Spacek) have built up a successful hotel/resort in the Florida Keys. Their children are generally successful with the exception of the one black sheep (Ben Mendelsohn) who has just returned and is throwing a monkey in the wrench. But is he bad for bad's sake or has this come about because of some very specific events? As this pot boils these things come to the surface and the questions arise that bring into question who's good and who's bad and what does that really mean?

This is some heavy, heady stuff. It benefits from good writing and very good acting. Kyle Chandler is on the rise and his acting prowess has benefited from the choice of good projects. As a chief law enforcement officer of the town, he is put in a very precarious situation. Spacek and Shepard are veterans who don't slack here. The real shining star however is Mendelsohn. His Danny Rayburn is very complicated. He's difficult to read. Is he bad? Is he good? Is he really turning a new leaf? The viewer is brought right to the edge when they find out.

The 14 episodes are laid out well and things move at an even pace. I never felt rushed or that time lagged. The plot is complicated but not so much so that I felt lost. The tension tightens and releases evenly so things don't get too overwrought. It all melded into a satisfying whole.

This is about as good as any series I've seen on TV. So, if you have the chance to see it. don't pass it up.",1441497600,15,1680,4.357827476038339

7359892,3,B0130M95YQ,"NO SPOILERS:

To get a sense for the show, my strategy was to view the first 3-episodes, which is what I understand was provided to professional critics.  I would like to believe that I have personally evolved to the point where I can recognize such concepts as ""setting the stage"" or ""building up the drama"".  However, the pace was so incredibly slow and the plot lines were so agonizingly opaque, that I actually found myself dozing off through each of the first 2-episodes and needed to plunge my face into a bowl of ice and shotgun a double espresso to get through the 3rd.

In addition:

1.) I found the characterizations to be one-dimensional

2.) It was difficult for me to picture Kyle Chandler sans warm-ups on a football field

3.) While Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard gave OK performances, I didn't feel that they were asked to do all that much

4.) Chlo Sevigny (who I love as an actress - see ""Hit & Miss"") and Mia Kirshner (who I like a lot) could have been better utilized

8726857,3,B0130M95YQ,"I have watched the first 3 or 4 episodes, and so far, I am VERY disappointed.  I like Kyle Chandler, , Ben Mendelsohn (Aussie actor), and Linda Cardinelli, but, so far in this series, I don't like any of them that much.

The script is poorly written; it attempts to be mysterious, which is fine, but if you don't care much about the characters, then you don't care much about the mystery and what is being said.

Because the show is not that well done, I find myself noticing other things.  The family runs a hotel-resort, but rarely do we see them actually at work.  They argue about the business, they talk about the business, but I almost never see any single one of them actually participating in the business itself.  You just cannot have a hotel which supports 6 or 7 people, and none of those people actually work. They do seem to find time to argue.  How successful is a business when the owners are out there arguing all the time?  Near the end, Ben M's character does some stuff related to the hotel-resort, but only because it is related to the plot.

Like many HBO shows, Netflix, Showtime shows, there is a lot of swearing--Jesus Christ is spoken of all the time, but no one goes to church.  The f-word is found a lot.  Quite frankly, I get tired of shows in which half of their characters swear with most every sentence that they speak.  That is another thing which makes little sense.  You don't go into the hospitality business and spend most of the time swearing...you simply do not behave that way in front of you customers.  Most people, when their lives are consume by a business (and most people with their own business put in 10-16 hours a day), they become so careful not to swear in front of their customers that, most of the time, they rarely swear at all.  You may think that I am being picky here, and maybe I am...but that is because the show bores me so far.

Sometimes, it takes a show a couple episodes to find its footing, for its actors to find their characters.  But, so far, by show 3 or 4, the show has not gotten me hooked yet.

Oh, one more thing.  None of the brothers and sisters look like brothers and sisters.  I know that happens a lot as well; but, you don't notice it as much if the show is good.  You accept it, as you accept a lot of things in a show, if the show itself is good.  If the show is not that good, then you find yourself thinking about all kinds of peripheral things.

I don't think there is an American version of this DVD yet; so be careful if you make the mistake of buying this DVD.  You will need a region-free DVD player.

I quit about mid-series and finally decided to go back and finish it.  All the way to the end, I did not really identify with any of the characters; I was not really rooting for any of the characters; and I do not have this great desire to go to the next season (if there is one) to see what happens next.",1504483200,,2894,4.235401459854015

I know this is for season 1 but I assume that if you are going to watch this that you will want to watch all 3 seasons, correct? If I were you I would find another show to watch because Season 3 was BY FAR the most unsatisfying conclusion to any show that I enjoyed in my 5 decades on the planet. And I've watched a lot of shows. I'm not saying that they didn't wrap things up the way that I want. I'm saying that it was as if the scripts for the last episodes of the show were slapped together by a drugged idiot in one blurry evening. I've watched shows that I may have thought could have ended better - X-Files or Seinfeld are things that people complain about the finales. This is not like that. Those are Emmy worthy compared to this. The first 2 seasons of Bloodline were excellent - one of my absolute favorite shows on Netflix. Moody, atmospheric, great acting and most importantly great writing. Then in Season 3 they try to wrap things up and it is revealed that they don't have a clue how to do that. STOP READING NOW BECAUSE I AM GOING TO DETAIL JUST HOW BAD THIS IS.

1. For the entire 2nd to last episode (and some of the final episode) John has a breakdown with reality and hallucinates the whole episode. He talks to Danny (who of course is dead and has way too much screen time in season 3) and EVERY SINGLE THING John does and experiences we don't know if it is real or not. You will wait for them to wrap up this whole thing and you will get a whole episode of psychological wanking that just does not work on any level.

2. Important characters killed off just to get rid of them. What happens to the Beau Bridges character? The don't have a real way to sum things up so he just has a heart attack and dies. That fixes that. John Leguizamo's character has a big part in the series. What will happen with him you wonder? He'll die suddenly and pointlessly, that's what.

3. Sissy Spacek's character tries to sell the inn and is thwarted because she is told that the whole place will be underwater in 10 years. Really??? They live in a community with properties valued at 100's of millions of dollars and no one knows before this that the whole place will be underwater shortly. Ridiculous.

4. Kevin laughably flees to Cuba with his wife and baby. Seriously? Is this a real plan that a mother would go along with? Kevin makes a speech about how he let his life take him places and should have taken more control. You think? Was this script written by a 14 year old?

5. There's a trial for the guy falsely accused of killing Marco. There is so much reasonable doubt you could drive a truck through the holes in the prosecution's case. The Rayburns are the detective on the case that is first on the scene and the only witness. It is ALL suspect. But Sissy Spacek cries on the stand (she has been through so much, oh my) and the jury convicts the guy or else he takes a plea. Laughable.

6. Meg disappears for most of the last season including the final episode. Linda Cardellini is arguably the biggest star on this show and she has practically no impact in the final season and is absent for half of the episodes! She was involved in everything for 2 seasons and now she must have some other place she needs to be. Smart woman.

I could go on and on but I will stop with these examples.

A supposedly high caliber series on Netflix or any premium network is supposed to take you out of yourself and cause you to forget that you are watching actors read words on camera. This show fails at that more than I would have even thought possible. There has to be an unspoken agreement between the creators of a show like this and the viewer that if you give me your time I will give you some semblance of quality, at least close to the level of previous seasons. Bloodline has the biggest disparity in quality between season 2 and 3 that I have ever experienced. FYI - I don't normally even review tv series, but if 1 person doesn't watch this mess because of this review I feel that I have given them a gift. Rant off. Time to forget.",1497398400,4,4210,4.265664160401003
