8322956,5,B001N2PM2A,"I have been a big fan of Carmina Burana. This 115 minute documentary tells all about the man and his music. I  recommend this DVD by Tony Palmer highly.
The most important part of this documentary is about what is called Schulwerk (school work) for young children using the Orff teaching method. We see young children in China, South Africa and Greece learning music and rhythm, which lead to improved self confidence and the ability to learn in school.",1366243200,,453,4.734177215189874
8322957,4,B001N2PM2A,"Thomas Werner, writing in his brief yet helpful biography of Orff, there are 21 pages of text, states that the Orff phenomenon in its entirety still waits discovery in all its dimensions. There is the ""Orff"" of Orff Schulwerk, described by the American Orff-Schulwerk Association as an approach to teach and learn music for children based on the traditional music and folklore of each country. There is Orff's varied encounter with early music, arranging performances especially of Monteverdi, as well as Orff's own reworkings of Baroque and early pieces. There is Orff the ethno-musicologist encountering musicians and instruments from other cultures. Then there is Orff the composer of light works such as Der Mond, as well as his interest in drama, especially folk theatre, and including his rather more serious works based on Greek themes such as Oedipus and Antigone. There is Carmina Burana, a fairly light work; most people know Orff only by that work. It is the only work of his that made it to the repetory of the leading orchestras and ensembles of the world.

Faced with such a multifaceted subject, Tony Palmer presents us with a scrapbook of images from various parts of Orff's world. All the above aspects of the composer and many more are in some way covered in the film. To that extent it is a very helpful introduction to the life and work of the composer, an excellent place to start in understanding Orff, and despite being at times rather disjointed and meandering, there is much to be gleaned from unpicking Tony Palmer's thread. One aspect of Orff's work that is not covered in the film is Orff as librettist and playwrite. I have read that Brecht admired Die Kluge and went to see it several times.

There are brief extracts from a number of his works in excellent performances, mostly by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Donald Runicles, and much applauded by Edward Greenfield and Humphrey Carpenter in the accompanying notes. As far as I can tell, the extracts are from

Orfeo, Orffs reworking of Monteverdi's work
Der Mond
Die Kluge
Die Bernauerin
Carmina Burana
Catulli Carmina
Prometheus
Oedipus
Antigone
Schulwerk - Musica Poetica
Comoedia de Christi Resurrectione - Ein Osterspiel
De Temporum fine Comeodia. Comedy for the End of Time.

There are good subtitles on the film, although it is not always clear which work is being performed. Referring to the Chapters section if a particular passage of music is not identified in the film can be helpful but there are times when even this is not sufficient, and in any case, that is not possible when the film is being shown on television. There is an extract from Antigonae that is at first shown with footage from Der Mond. This is not helpful. I am finding that as I become more familiar with Orff's music my appreciation of this film grows but it assumes a knowledge of Orff's works that is not generally the case.

A key part of the unfamiliarity of these works is that some recordings do not have the text in any language let alone English, so after buying a recording conducted by Kurt Eichorn or by Herbert Kegel in particular, the next task is to find a translation of the text. This essentially is the Orff problem but there are solutions for some of his works, see Tag ""Orff for English speakers"":

For Die Kluge and Der Mond, William Mann's translation can be found on the EMI recording conducted by Wolfgang Savallisch that is listed as B00000DO6Y. It is not the only version of this recording that EMI have issued; other editions may not have the libretto in English.

There are five DVDs of Orff's works produced by Wergo, available from www.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de . Gisei, Oedipus, Antigonae, and die Bernauerin have English subtitles and I assume this is also the case with Astutuli. The subtitles of Oedipus and Antigonae are taken from David Constantine's translation of Holderlin's version that is published in a single volume by Bloodaxe Books. The text for these two works is complex and poetic and requires some study to make sense of much of it, so it is a useful volume to have when viewing the DVDs. There are also more readable volumes of translations from the original Greek that are available. There is also a CD set of die Bernauerin on Orfeo that is rather good and it has the text in German with English translation. Despite the above, some of Orff's works still do not have English translations available.

In the film there are passages from Der Mond and Die Bernauerinn that are used as background but they are not identified. In particular, there is footage of burning buildings and then of piles of bodies at an extermination camp that are accompanied by an extract from Der Mond. There is much footage relating to the Third Reich but it is not clear why such footage it is used to such an extent in a film about Orff. The composer was not a supporter of National Socialism and his sins of that sort, he was a Catholic, though perhaps considerable, were not more than ones of omission and association during that period. There is an interview with the widow of a member of the Weisse Rose [Udo Zimmermann has written an opera that covers the last days of two members of the Weisse Rose] anti fascist movement whose husband was murdered by the Gestapo. Her husband had frequently met Orff and she had hoped that he would have appealed on behalf of her husband. Orff was plagued with guilt after this incident.

There is a lengthy section on Schulwerk however it is not made sufficiently clear how Orff's actual ideas relate to the methodology that music educators call ""Orff"", though there are long sections of the film showing Orff practitioners at work.

There is much else that could be said about this film. It is overall interesting, informative and insightful despite its disjointedness. It is good starting point for understanding the Orff phenomenon. There are scenes of nudity in parts of the film.

Thomas Werner's brief biography published by Schott is also fairly useful.",1326153600,,6033,4.796920115495669
8322958,5,B001N2PM2A,"What makes this DVD different from many others about composers is the large amount of video footage available showing Carl Orff, the times, and performances of his work.  Before watching this DVD I knew little about Carl Orff or his music beyond Carmina Burana.  After watching this DVD, I feel that his music deserves to be better known and bought a number of CDs of his non Carmina Burana music.  At a deeper level this DVD deals with the issues of accommodation -- how does one survive and pursue their passion (composing) when the world one knows is dissolving around them.  Though Tony Palmer does not do this with a hammer, the themes of accommodation, survival and guilt are recurrent.  The film is beautifully done.  The interposition of interview, background images and performance provide a strong forward motion that maintains interest.  I watched this DVD twice.  I watched it once and then immediately watched it again, I found it that interesting.",1283644800,4,961,4.925465838509317
8322959,4,B001N2PM2A,"I have watched ""O, Fortuna!"" once and, contrary to the DVD product description, there is no interview with Orff himself.  Moreover, they mention that he consistently refused interviews with the comment ""let them pick over my life when I am dead"".

His sins in the Nazi era appear to be primarily of omission.  He did nothing to help anybody, nor to hinder the Nazi party and was on their payroll.  Compared to him Winifred Wagner was a saint in that she did save lives of artists and their families in the course of preserving Bayreuth.  From the accounts on the documentary he was very much an ""ivory tower"" person: his work was everything.  Members of his family say he hated the Nazis.  He was far from being a hero and lived with a burden of guilt, but neither was he an active Nazi.  Surprisingly, he was of Jewish heritage and managed to hide it from the government.  Perhaps that forced him to keep a low profile and not rock the boat.

The film gives a number of short excerpts of his works.  I guess I have to agree that as a composer he is not top rank, but ""Carmina Burana"" will endure.  The other works appear occasionally, perhaps more in Germany.  I live in Los Angeles and ""Die Kluge"" was performed recently in Long Beach.

Ultimately, his greatest worth may be as a music educator.  A number of instances are shown on the DVD.  I found the portion dealing with teaching cerebral palsy kids long and for a layman difficult to see progress.  Perhaps Palmer should have shown short clips of sessions over a several week period.  At any rate I would skip over this in subsequent viewings.

This is an important DVD in that it is a well balanced overview of a difficult, little understood  man in a horrible time.  Let the timid be warned that there is incidental full frontal female nudity.",1261785600,8,1802,4.5
8322960,5,B001N2PM2A,"Every Tony Palmer film is worth the investment. ""O Fortuna"" is no exception.  For the best and most interesting DVD's on the lives of musicians stick with Tony Palmer.",1256601600,,167,4.758620689655173
8322961,2,B001N2PM2A,"Why did Tony Palmer bother with Carl Orff? Orff has only one real great work, Carmina Burana and the rest of his work is not that good. He is known from his educational work which is noted here but there were other, greater composers like Hindemith that made important contributions to education and music. Palmer seems to be interested in whether or not Orff was sympathetic to the Third Reich which remains a question. What you find out here was that Orff did nothing during the Second World War to help anybody and after the war he lied about being part of the opposition. Orff was a coward, an opportunist and is very unimportant as a composer. If it were not for Carmina Burina we would have never heard of him.",1248134400,2,716,4.473282442748092
8322962,4,B001N2PM2A,"Palmer shows us Carl Orff the man on all his facets, the good and the dubious. As expected from Palmer, he delivers it artistically, with the right amount of beautiful scenes as well as the ugly ones; the puppets and the hands performance are just great; the short clips of the Nazi era are also well placed and relevant to the story at play. This documentary goes to great length to show Orff's contribution to education through his Schulwerk (Schoolwork) and its dissemination through the world. Orff's music is used extensively through the film, but I was a little bet disappointed that it is not described or talked about too much. Obviously Carmina Burana is explained in terms of his history and background, but no about the music itself. For example, any correlation to Stravinsky's music is not mentioned at all, and there certainly is! Carl Orff the man was exactly that, a man with virtues and guilt. What endures in time, aside of the Schulwerk, is his music, somehow missing in this otherwise great documentary.",1242864000,17,1023,4.818181818181818
