8240192,4,B001132GR0,"This video is of the IDEA fitness convention in 2007 (this video is also available through their site). The presentation given by Fraser Quelch who was the long time director of programming and education for Fitness Anywhere, best known for the TRX. He covers several topics over the course of the interactive lecture. Mostly intended for trainers and those designing exercise programs, Quelch talks about how the body is supposed to and does work. How we have decided to train the parts and not the body (which is wrong by the way), leads Quelch to cover how those who design programs should redesign them without forcing specific programming upon the viewer. It should be mentioned that several articles and power point slides are floating around the web about this subject (planar training), but the video provides a depth that the other materials lack.",1344902400,,856,4.993006993006993
