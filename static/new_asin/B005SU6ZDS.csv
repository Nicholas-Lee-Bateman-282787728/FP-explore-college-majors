4887161,3,B005SU6ZDS,"As I write this, there are only two other reviews of A Warm Wind, one attacking all who do not ""support our troops,"" the other citing the ""fascism"" of the Bush administration.  I'm not claiming middle ground; I find hope and despair in both positions.  A neighbor in my Northern Michigan forest and lake development put out two signs in the fall of 2004, one ""Support Our Troops"" the other endorsed ""Kerry/Edwards"" in the presidential race.  I agree with one critic that we owe apologies and an enormous debt to those (and the families of those) killed and injured in Iraq, and with the other that we should not have elected that cowboy who used his presidency to prove that he was more of a man than his daddy.  This film arouses both feelings -- in an incredibly slow, tortured presentation.

I bought it because I thought it was a gay film.  It's not.  It has a couple (maybe 3) gay characters in it, and the straight, injured marine. Buck, couldn't care less that his helpful cousin David is gay.  In fact, when he isn't distracted by his PTSD, he's laying plans to find a boyfriend for Dave.  The pace of the film is one of long silences between slow delivery of speeches (for once, my much needed closed captions get ahead of the dialogue!).  Still, I'm glad I bought it and may look at it a few more times, simply because it gives me some space to arrange my own responses to the war we should not have fought and our responsibilities to those we let volunteer to be maimed or killed.

The marine hero, Buck, survived a roadside bombing of a humvee without a scar on his excellent body - a puzzle given that he must be lifted to stand and moves only in a wheelchair or with crutches that encase his lower arms.  (Another supposedly badly injured marine has only the trace of a scar on his cheek.)  I have to conclude that they are actors, but the sincerity of their presentation nags at me that they are ""real"" and that this is their story.  A Warm Wind is an odd case of poor production values and incredibly slow pace increasing the intensity of the message of the drama.  My regret in filing this review is that the likeyhood of someone responding to my ambivalance is remote. The question of whether we misled Buck (and what we owe him for it) is an imperative one as we bring the troops home.",1324944000,33,2304,4.400943396226415
4887162,3,B005SU6ZDS,"David is a 20-something gay man, owner of a small construction business, and seemingly in a rut with the rest of his life.  He hears that his cousin, Buck, with whom he spent a lot of time up through high school (before Buck went into the Marines), has returned from Iraq with severe injuries, and is living with his alcoholic father.  Ignoring advice that Buck should be taken care of by the government directly, David decides to extend an offer to Buck to live with him, and the two work on reconnecting after so many years of drastically different activity.  Ultimately, David begins to help Buck through his issues, while Buck helps David gain perspective on his own.

This is a very different kind of film for gay writer/director Jeff London.  While it has gay characters (two, possibly three if my ""gaydar"" is working), it is most definitely NOT a ""gay movie,"" per se.  It also addresses an issue (supporting the troops fighting the war) from a rather hawkish position, although it does make it clear that supporting the soldiers is a different matter than supporting the politics (or politicians) who put them in harm's way.

Acting seemed capable to me, nice soundtrack (includes some original tunes), capable photography.  I thought the ending (several minutes of voice-over while looking at a lake) was more than a bit abrupt, and should have been planned out better.  Overall, I give the film three stars out of five.",1324339200,12,1428,4.795918367346939
4887163,1,B005SU6ZDS,"Zac Titus is a good actor, but he's given little to work with here. The script is very superficial.

What begins as a pretty shallow character study, about 80% throught become a fascist screed! Very surprisingly one dimensional: very pro-war (specifically the US war on Iraq), very pro-Bush, and very militarist.

It has 2 asexual gay characters....but why? What is the point?

In the end, it is no more than strange fascist propaganda.",1324339200,12,436,4.945205479452055
4887164,3,B005SU6ZDS,"Decent movie but.......I don't know why Amazon is listing this movie as G-a-y, theres nothing G-a-y about it except they mention the main character is G-a-y and thats it.",1521331200,4,170,4.896551724137931

4887166,2,B005SU6ZDS,"A somewhat confusing intro followed by characters that think more than they speak, followed by a full third of the movie wasting time before introducing the 1 character who carries the entire film. This could have been so much more and so much better had it not given the viewer the impression that the script was changed several times throughout. It seems like London could not make up his mind about where he wanted this to go. As a result, right in the middle, it goes down the dark, never-ending road of politics. Of course,  how could we possibly expect anything else with a conveniently-placed bottle of Jack Daniels on a table with 3 men ( suffering from various degrees of PTSD)  talking about their war experiences. The only redeeming quality of which one of the two gay men in the cast who was not in any war decided to try and help veterans by turning his home into a place of refuge ( that is not a spoiler). The other comments that talk about how this movie turned into a war-hawkish movie are quite correct. It is too bad London decided to not only go there but to waste so much time there! Other script-killers are a man drinking JD with another man who is on pain meds, ptsd meds and anti-depressants! Good way to take care of your friend! BY LEADING HIM TO THE GRAVE! Second, give up your stupid internal homophobia and don't be afraid to give your hurting friend a hug when it is excruciatingly obvious that is what he needs! Third, do not keep chewing the same one bite of apple pie for 5 minutes while you are talking! Fourth, if a man is injured to the point where he cannot walk he will show at least some sign of the injury either on his spine or on his legs. All this guy had were tats on his upper back. It really would not have taken a lot just to wrap his legs or leave him in a wheelchair and cover his legs with a blanket or have him give one sentence saying that he had a spinal cord injury. Finally, sure sign the production was not sufficiently funded when 1 of the main characters has to describe his eventual reality over the ending credits. What he said happened would have been worth watching and made this more of a success. 2 stars for Zack Titus' performance.
Never fear, if you are the crying type this will jerk the tears out of you, albeit contrived.",1519948800,4,2292,4.3279069767441865

4887176,5,B005SU6ZDS,"Ive owned this movie for a couple of years and watched it many times.  Every time I watch it, I get choked up.  This film manages to bring out emotion before you know what hits you - especially at the end.  Zac Titus gives a remarkable performance and a convincing one at that.  You'll swear that in real life he has no use of his legs as he doesn't falter a single time.  The film's characters are gay, straight, drunk, a touch of homophobia, friends who are supportive and others who are not, but they all come around in the end.  With the mix of character traits, nothing is in your face.  But the movie manages to keep focus on the effects of war and a marine who returns from war with a host of problems that must be dealt with in a daily basis.  However, love (of family) does conquer all in the end!",1440547200,2,806,4.15483870967742

4887184,2,B005SU6ZDS,"I've always enjoyed Jeff London's films. They aren't cinematic masterpieces but they are heartfelt portraits of the lives of ordinary men (gay or otherwise), which I appreciate. Many of the elements I enjoy were present in A Warm Wind as well, particularly in the caring relationship between cousins David and Buck. That said, the film veers into propaganda during the dinner table conversation about the war in Iraq with every character ganging up on the one who opposed it. That scene could have been an important conversation where differing view points were aired and, where, if agreement wasn't achieved, at least they could have respected each other's differences. This was a major disappointment.",1407542400,5,703,5.230088495575221

4887186,1,B005SU6ZDS,"THIS REVIEW DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE REVIEW LIST -
 AS A MATTER A FACT 5 OTHERS WHERE REMOVED FROM
 FROM THE AMAZON LIST TO GIVE THIS ""FILM"" FULL OF
 PROPAGANDA - A BETTER RATING

This film has an openly good intention as it begins, though, it
displays nothing but hostility for anyone's opinion, other then
their own, that ""if you do not support your country's stance on
war - your a deadbeat"".  The tirade of one of the film's characters
(the injured soldiers father), that ""the military protects your rights,
and asks nothing in return"" is so full of falsehoods, it gave us indigestion.

We have been to over 60 countries, and soldiers of the military - especially
those in the country that calls itself ""The U. S."" pays their soldiers a paycheck
from future generations own taxes.  Many famalies actually live in nice
homes and have food everyday on their tables - because they receive
a paycheck from taxes paid to the government - nothing is free.

The film has good points of how we should take care of each other in times
of duress and moments of cause, yet we cannot support this film, especially
with one of the characters being gay (and the same war-loving character
that supports the military calling him a ""homo"" in the film).  Eli  Roman.",1389398400,,1250,4.565022421524664
4887187,3,B005SU6ZDS,"This film has a good message, but it could have been a more successful short.  There is way too much time spent on the simple message of acceptance.

4887188,5,B005SU6ZDS,"I was informed of this movie by the writer (Jeff London) and had a chance to watch it and see how it stood up to military realism etc. I have seen some other reviews and their take on the movie (whether pro war/antiwar or referencing the gay characters etc)but I can also tell these are viewers who did not see the movie from a military background but just as another movie...

As far as the characters, I though Buck was a little less gung-ho than most Marines are but in this case it was a very good thing. There are many movies out there that can portray the military with this gruff and rugged characteristic but this movie didn't need that, it was (in my eyes) meant to focus on the individual and his response to the war. While his character explained his emotions it never seemed out of touch with real claims from fellow service members or the kind of descriptors I have used to explain ""over there"". His character was the ""transitional character"" that most of us faced when getting out of the military.

There were gay characters, there were drunk characters, and there were narcissistic characters but I didn't see them played out as ""those"" stereotypes, I saw them as what I believe they were intended to be, the average family in this day and age. You have very different people all responding in their own way to something they have no true first hand knowledge of (except Buck) and how they related to him coming home and their view on who was to blame.

I found it very refreshing to see a movie where it wasn't all guns & bombs like most but actually showing the effects of war on a young person who may or may not have even believed what he did was right. Even through the (as some have termed it) pro-war sequence where they go over Iraq and whether it was right/wrong etc. Truth is, we as a civilization and as a nation as well do not really know all the factors to give an opinion on the overlying issue. Even having served myself I do not know how to describe Iraq because even with my boots on the ground multiple times, I did not see everything and after being back 6 years I still cannot express my feelings on the war, besides I was there and I did it. I saw a lot of myself in Buck and I think that's why I enjoyed the movie.

Overall I believe it was a very good attempt at showing the other side of the conflict and the return process, I didn't find it preachy, or honestly biased in either direction (there were characters on both sides of each issue) and it was a good blend of the surroundings and the individual soldier. I recommend it to any service members struggling with their identity or questions after getting out and I believe if watched with an open mind, it can be viewed as what I saw, an attempt to express the one thing nobody wants to discuss, PTSD, and the long term cost of ANY conflict on the soldiers that were there and the families that support them.",1358121600,11,2902,4.329044117647059
4887189,5,B005SU6ZDS,This is a great movie.  Simple and direct.  A movie that shows that there is more to a gay man than thinking about sex and shows that we have hearts and souls.  Must adimit that I had tears in my eyes several times.  Add this to your dvd collection whether you are straight or gay if nothing else to shgow support to our troops.,1357689600,,328,4.078125
4887190,4,B005SU6ZDS,"This movie could have had made a much stronger statement about LGBT's serving in our armed forces.  However, for those who need to educate someone at the mildest first exposure to this info, it is good at introducing the subject to first time exposure of just who really protects them and does so without asking anything in return but self patriotism.",1342051200,,351,4.754098360655738
4887191,5,B005SU6ZDS,"I read of this movie and several people I know were waiting to view this movie at thier area theature. We all had the pleasure of watching this movie at the bigs screen; and several times during the movie there wasn't a dry eye in the house! I think we can all try to imagine the difficulties our soldiers face during war; however, unless a member of the Military or a close friend or family member, - there is really no true way of understanding to the extent many of our soldiers put thier lives on the line. Most return home with various physical and mental issues, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I am truly thankfull for the mena and woman who serve, and regardless of my political views or opinion of the war, - as an American it is my responsibility to support my fellow Americans who serve for our Country's continued freedom and safety. I was rather disapointed in a couple of the opinions listed here. Clearly obvious those with fragile sensabilities living in a world which revolves around themselves and thier views; a movie made to remind Americans simply because the war is over, - that for many, the hard work, the loss, the trajedy has just begun. There are tens of thousands of WW2 and pre-9/11 war veterans who continue to suffer from terrible nightmares, and depression. Many who have long been deemed unemployable with physical or mental difficulties leading various levels of degradable existances living on the streets lucky to receive under a thousand dollars a month. In other words we've used them and abused them, and threw them out. This movie shows the importance of Americans standing behind helping soldiers who return injured. To never forget their sacrafice and when a 23 year old back from two two year tours in Iraq spends his days lying on a mat inside a dark room rocking back and forth crying and falling asleep to endless nightmares contemplating suicide and wondering why his best friends died and he/she didnt,- that maybe, just maybe in 2012, - we can turn off the sports games, (where every dude makes 20 million a year) long enough to support our elected officials who support our veterans. People need to grown up before they run thier mouth.

4887192,5,B005SU6ZDS,"This movie says what a lot of us are feeling. It supports America and our troops, bringing different characters together. So what if there is a gay guy, he is a positive role image who steps up to help his cousin. This movie finally hits the nail that we should be supporting our returning soldiers. This is clearly not a plug to support the war -that is ridiculous. It does support this guys choice to fight, and that is why I respect the filmmakers and how they present it. Great job, guys! My military friends appreciate it. Finally an accurate story on how some of these guys feel.",1328313600,2,585,4.425925925925926
4887193,1,B005SU6ZDS,"This movie, though well intentioned, turns out to be a jingoistic diatribe that is insulting to anyone who is not pro-war, pro pre-emptive military action (where the hell are those weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?), pro-military (despite the heinous crimes that are often committed) and pro foisting of American ideals (that upon closer examination are somewhat tarnished) upon peoples of other nations. Yes, the American people owe a debt of gratitude to our soldiers and our veterans, and a lot more help when they return home than they are often given, but we do not owe them or the military establishment unrelenting approval. There are some powerful performances here, but I don't like the message. Basically, the movie says that if you don't approve of everything the military stands for and does, shut up, and that is insulting and annoying to anyone who has a different opinion.",1326326400,8,890,5.02027027027027
