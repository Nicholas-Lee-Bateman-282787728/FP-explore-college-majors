4849957,1,B005NYMXIU,"I totally agree with monkdude ~ this ""thing"" is just too stupid to be able to fly that antique 50ties inspired spacecraft ~ although for a moment - just briefly I though I was on the La Page set of the Met's RING.

BUT nothing THAT utterly predatorial could represent any form of intelligent life  HOWEVER, I did kind of like the CGI and the Breugel [?] inspired THING.  Lots of eyecrandy and a nod to Clive Barker and his homoeroticmasochism.  Title?  The extremely odd ""copulation"" sequence that drew a few catcalls from the small audience ..... absolutely ""axe and tail"".

The is NO story - judging by the original previews months ago - lots of reshoots happened - probably under ""studio"" [does that thing still exist?] control - unless - Like Spielberg's first dreadful efforts - this neophyte director left - to Quote Richard Dreyfuss on JAWS -"" drek"" to be assembled into a ""movie"" - Verna Fields saved JAWS .... BRAVO Miss Verna

This ""Thing"" needed a Verna Fields - and mentioning tech ... COSTUME 'DESIGN'?  ""COSTUME DESIGN""?  WHAT - Pray I ask did this ""designer"" design?  Everything's off the rack ~ unless we suddenly have acquired utility haute couture .....

OVERLOOKED - In SOLARIS we have a replicant - the ""creature's clothing"" is part of the body ... now that would hav been really cool .... or our Femme Fatale useing perhaps a female household product as a weapon?  JUST to splatter a bit of humor into this grim  recycled crap.

FINALLY we glimpse into the Flying Saucer .... bland, very bland ... this may have been a ""hunting"" expedition gone wrong with the prey escaping OR better thought - these alines upon landing morph into replicants of local specie ... and something went gnorw ...wrong ....  I would rather ""go"" with a Space / Time device ... little green men from Mars are sooooooooooooooo passe .... besides no one really understand the laws of alchemy ... That spinning column in the craft was SO misused and could have provided clues - possibly the real THING?  For pure kicks - the craft should have given us a Kubrick obelisk nod - 2001ish???

SPFX owes a HIGE BOW bow to Lovecraft's indie  ""FROM BEYOND"".

Thsi version is like a visit to a haunted house ... peering into ""boo"" rooms.  Painful pacing ... methond acting does not belong here ..... someone like James Cameron should have been selected to supervise .... and 3D the work ... NOW THAT was a total ""Miss"" by Comcast/GE/NBC/UNI.

As EACH morph hits we [audience]  literally get a ""TAH DAH!"" fanfare .. far better the 2nd take look .... now you see it  ... maybe ... look ... then suddenly it is there?

This movie literally ""screams"" for 3D.

Squinty eyed little Male ""lead"" is a Kurt Russell clone, female ... very odd casting ... she's OK but closer to a librarian than Weaver in ALIEN.

This premise does beat Geiger's opium dream inspired ""Alien"" and the rest of his crappy muck.

Best for circle jerk boys ... the 5 or 6 audience members I ""interviewed"" we're Okish with this product.

Better luck next time and get a single writer back - not the milk and cookies crowd - aim for wine and cheese ... good stuff.",1318636800,,3113,4.580470162748644
4849958,3,B005NYMXIU,"The Thing (2011) should have a different title because it is a prequel, not a remake. It shows what went down at the Norwegian's camp that Macready (Kurt Russell) and his crew investigated in John Carpenter's 1982 classic. You know, an alien is found frozen in ice that has the ability to copy other organisms and often twist itself into grotesque forms before killing someone. Unfortunately it is almost an exact copy of the last movie, but with weaker characters and hit and miss CGI. The nearly 30 year old practical effects blow away the SFX here, but they are not so horrendous that it ruins the whole experience. The best parts of this prequel are when the paranoia sets in and nobody trusts anyone. The cast is better than your average horror movie nowadays. Mary Elizabeth Winestead does a good job as the lead character, but nobody is developed enough to care about. I did like how the scenes during the end credits directly leads into Carpenter's The Thing. We even get a few of those eerie bass lines that brought so much tension all those years ago.

Some will like it for being a companion piece to the 1982 film and others will hate it just because it doesn't achieve any level of greatness, or try to be anything other than a copy (ha, fits the theme of the movie) of what came before.

On a side note, I always wondered what the true form of The Thing creature actually looked like. The alien that is frozen in the block of ice has claws and doesn't resemble something that could build such a huge and complex spaceship. My theory is that the ""Thing"" infected the alien crew of the ship on some planet and caused them to crash on Earth. Uh oh, I can see it now. The Thing vs. Aliens vs. Predators! The horror, the horror...",1318550400,2,1739,4.448275862068965

4849972,4,B005NYMXIU,"The thing about The Thing is that it had the potential to be a better movie than what the final film was. The team at ADI created amazingly detailed masterpieces got this film that were ultimately tossed to Side in favor of Cgi per the producers wishes. The footage can be found in behind the scenes videos on YouTube. This movie does a great job at trying to dissect the scenery of the original burnt out remains of the Norwegian camp in the original film and rebuilding it. Funny bit of info though, the burnt up remains resembling the Norwegian camp in the 82'film were actually what was left of the destroyed American camp after it had been destroyed. It's not a bad movie in the least though it may have not been a fan favorite. The elements are there for a great movie, they just don't hit every note and I believe that to be the Cgi.",1521849600,,840,4.322784810126582

This movie is in no way as good as the 1982 masterpiece but it's different enough to be judged on it's own merits. The writing was excellent and that alone made it a worthy successor. I think this film is a  little like the Dawn Of The Dead remake, it brought something new to the ideas without losing the magic that the original put forth.  I wasn't a huge fan of the CGI. My love of the in-camera effects of the original thing kept me from accepting them completely but I will admit they worked for what the 2011 version was attempting.

4849979,2,B005NYMXIU,"As the saying goes ""some questions are better left unanswered"" fits perfectly with this movie. I am glad I rented this on amazon not purchased. This being said I have seen both films multiple times and have enjoyed reading the novels as well

The Thing (2011) being the prequel to the 1982 The Thing leaves a lot to be desired. I appreciate and enjoy that the movie shows how the events occur the American team discovers in the 1982 version but doesn't make up for the cookie cutter plot or the weak attempt for tension in the film.

The opening  is nice and sheds some light but quickly you are given a cast that is hard to differentiate as you are given very little time before the major conflict occurs, which makes it hard to understand or care what is happening. Set aside the fact that the 1982 version had a killer cast each of team members were people that you had a chance to know their name, role, and personality building a foundation that helps the story to the end. In the 2011 version within the first hour a Norwegian is killed  shortly after the entire mystery of the alien is discovered, clever girl or poor writing, you decide.

One of the things that the 1982 version of The Thing did masterfully is the amount of tension, conflict, and suspense played musically in the film. No cheap tricks of CGI were needed the musical score sets the dark undertone, the characters build the conflict and tension, and the underlying question of who is infected leaves you tingling with suspense. Unfortunately The closest moment ,in the 2011 version, similar to the suspenseful ""Who is infected?"" moment  lasts roughly 5-10 minutes. The Thing in the 2011 version came off  as more of an atypical monster assimilating ridiculously fast, usually picking the most obvious moments to turn, and killing the team members without really having rhyme or reason.  While the The Thing in the 1982 version you could see was tactful, illusive, and was seemingly imperishable, just as you and the characters thought it was dead surprise. There was little to none of these moments of this in the 2011 version.

At it's core The Thing (1982) is about man vs man vs nature vs beast, the weather heavily affected the crew and the thing, the crew fought each other and doubted each other, and I feel most importantly the the thing was similar to a wounded creature. This can be seen as the creature chooses to hide, run, and fight only when it has the advantage over it's opponents. It uses intellect of those it assimilates sabotaging equipment and framing others all while hiding it's identity. The Thing (2011) was much more Man vs Beast the crew quickly gathered together under the lead protagonist never once asking her if she was infected NEVER, The Thing immediately attacks the crew not planning to pull them in one by one aside from a few occasions.

In the end the 2011 version of The Thing I feel misses what truly set the 1982 version apart from all the horror slashers of its time did and that was psychological horror, it didn't need to show every kill or gory detail you had wait and see who would be next or who to trust. If the 2011 version focused more on this aspect of who can be trusted, what to do, and why, I feel it would have made a much bigger mark in 2011. Separating it from all the other classic remakes in 2000's the many Friday The 13th remakes, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc, and etc.

the pictures are of my favorite scene from1982 and my least favorite from the 2011 version",1519689600,,3495,4.5493630573248405
4849980,1,B005NYMXIU,"I DVR'd the film from a showing on IFC and just finished watching it. I did not realize it was intended to be a prequel until I read the first few reviews here thusly comparing most scenes to John Carpenter's remake from the original 1950 Howard Hawks classic which is minus all the elaborate puppetry and CGI but still the superior film. I read nothing in advance of my screening of this film. Unfortunately, nothing shown in this version was a surprise at all, indeed even scenes which were not derivative, such as the inclusion of the female scientist early on, were so obviously transparent in intent as to be laughable. I knew from the get-go that she was to be this film's version of Ripley. Almost every scene has its counterpoint in Carpenter's version which lends more credence to the notion that Hollywood is completely out of film makers with any imagination or originality. The fact that the filmmakers called this a prequel is more deflection than truth. In their strangely obtuse way, the producers are attempting to ""time-machine"" their way as the creative film of original events, relegating Carpenter's film to be the also-ran imitation.

I'm awarding this version only 1 star. This is simply another remake that shows nothing more than we've already seen. 38 Million should have been spent on something with some amount of originality. Even outings with Ripley were better each time.",1519603200,,1401,4.88655462184874

4849987,1,B005NYMXIU,"This silly movie suffers for the very fact that it is a remake that tried to do something interesting by having a female character. And it was done for just the sake of making sure to have the female american audience onboard. And it FAILED. Hello Hollywood: your contrived gender silliness doesn't make for good action. What made Carpenters' version wonderfully unique was the VERY FACT THAT THERE WERE NO WOMEN, nor ""love interests"" as a cliche. We don't need toxic partisan politics in a film where men, who look strangely alike with their beards and testosterone to be watered down with ""a STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER"" because of ""CHANGING GENDER ROLE"" silliness. Men and paranoia is what made this film unique. Of course Hollywood, with no more attempt at originality, but to just continue to make super hero movies and remakes will infiltrate a great film like the ORIGINAL THE THING, which is now a landmark and try to throw in non inspired non creative additions like ...""...Lets bring in a chick and make her the BOSS!...Yeah, that's it... My daughter and her friends will love it and so will other american girls, they'll pay to watch it and we'll make lots of money...!!!"" No, on the contrary, the little entertainment that is in this silly prequel is because of the source writing of the ORIGINAL and the embedded unease of ""someone is not who you think they are."" Its a great premise. This film, that is contaminated with ""hey girls rock too"" mumbo jumbo doesn't belong in what they thought would be a franchise but was killed because of this monstrous joke. Whether girls ""rock"" or not has nothing to do with an original idea of Grizzled bearded, wearied men who look similar to each other entangled in the universal theme of ever increasing paranoia being preeminent. GENDER WARS AND GENDER POLITICS ruins great movies every time. And SANK THIS MOVIE. That a lowly digital special effects.",1517616000,3,1900,4.795731707317073

+ Good acting

+ Prequel that in many ways seamlessly integrates with the 1982 Thing.

+ Very good hidden creature suspense

+ Crazy images and creature forms

+ The creature here is less about hiding as it is its first encounter with mankind, but based on how things went it explains why in the 1982 movie it is more about hiding.

+ Not campy horror, but serious sci-fi horror.

+ Not overly predictable

Even though John Carpenter's treatment did finally bring in the ""mimic at the DNA level"" concept - that version bogged down in too much ""blood and guts"" and lacked the impact of John Campbell's subtlety.
This newest attempt suffers the same ""blood, gore and guts and things in my teeth"" (a quote from Arlo Guthrie) and not enough story.  It is supposed to prequel the John Carpenter version as did the original (B&W) version - but it is just messy - not scary.

4850029,4,B005NYMXIU,"If you enjoy the ""Thing"" movie trilogy a great (free pdf online) short story to read is ""The Things"" which is an award winning Sci Fi version of the middle movie (with Kurt Russell) but told FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THING. It's by Peter Watts.

clarkesworldmagazine d0t c0m /watts_01_10/  has a free pdf of it.

I'm not the author or anything, but it was a great short story.

As far as this prequel to the 1980s film of the same name: here's the thing about it-basically, they find the monster like the 1950s version of this movie and in a couple seconds the main female in the film deduces the entire problem of an alien that takes on other forms. Then it's a dumb chase movie but instead of cop cars, or sharks, or Paul Blart, it's a shape shifting monster.

There is no suspense. No surprises (except when they take a shocked guy in the helicopter to fly to a hospital--and that was only shocking for a split second--no spoilers here).

There was NO doubting people that needed to be convinced (well, sort of), there were no ""she's crazy--aliens aren't real"", there were no real ""don't trust so-and-so because they might be a 'thing' moments.

It was just: hey, I think this alien changes shape...everybody RUN AROUND IN ALL DIRECTIONS through this base. No real ""us vs. them"" or even ""us vs us vs us vs them"" going on.

It was literally: we found an alien. Oops, it came alive and started killing people. Hey, I found a dental filling so it must be cloning people...we should all run around screaming. This reminded me of that Aliens movie with Winona Ryder: why couldn't they just spend a couple hours coming up with a better plot? Just a couple hours and it would have been awesome. It wasn't bad, but it was just like a really long commercial for the film instead of the actual film. Here's a haunted house with things instead of people in ghost costumes...everybody run! The leaps on logic weren't as annoying as say, Prometheus (somehow I know something important is going on so I'll kamakazee-crash my ship into their ship just for kicks and kill us all), but just the same: if everyone solves the problem off screen in their heads in 20 seconds, then the entire rest of the movie is going to be mindless ""action"".

The female lead (I think) went on to be in season 3 of Fargo (she was great in it). The young scientist guy that looks like Shaggy from Scoobie Doo went on to one of those NYCSI-whatever shows.",1499299200,,2425,4.455981941309255

1) too much CG. What made the 82 version great were the practical effects and it made it the thing seem real.
2) there were no women in the norwegian in the 1982 version.
3) According to copper everythign was in norwegian. so it made zero sense that the scientist spoke english or would hire an american to help.
4) The norwegian camp didn't use thermite to break the UFO out of the ice as they did according to 1982 version
5) The 2 americans surviving the helicopter crash made zero sense.
6) Twin face was not 2 faces coming together it was 1 face becoming 2.
7) music was okay. but they should have just used original theme music.
8) Too many forgettable characters

4850040,5,B005NYMXIU,"I have been a fan of THE THING since the original Carpenter release in 1982. Went back and watched the original from 1951. It was good, but it was 1951....so the visual elements were PRIMITIVE!  I had seen this when first it was available in 2011. Back then, I didn't known who Mary Elizabeth Winstead was. When 10 Cloverfield Lane came out, it was a surprisingly excellent movie. In part, because I fell in love with Mary Elizabeth in that movie. So I learned recently that she was in THE THING. I had not recalled that. So I watched it again tonight, 2017, and it was excellent. Some good jump scares, some terrifying robotronics. Tension-filled, and quite a fun ride. Now, I think it was kind of funny that THE THING 2011 and 2010 Cloverfield Lane end with Mary Elizabeth tossing an explosive device into the teethy mouth of an attacking alien. Too coincidental!  LOL!
Movies like this have great space sound tracks, alien sound effects, and make one ponder the whole UNIVERSE -ARE WE ALONE QUESTION.....just like space music does to me in general.

4850051,5,B005NYMXIU,"Having just bought and watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B01GSW5VD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing [Collector's Edition] [Blu-ray</a>] (an extraordinary release), I decided to revisit the prequel and found I had not reviewed it. I enjoyed this film by Matthijs van Heijningen. There is a mix of puppetry and CGI, and you can tell but still, kudos for the effort. I genuinely enjoy the portrayal of the Norwegian camp which was such a gory scene in Carpenter's film. I enjoy watching these two back-to-back. Heijningen did a good job of capturing Carpenter's original claustrophobic feel as the team mistrusts each other.

Generally, I only buy films I intend to watch 2+ times, which is how I judge a film, more or less: the repeat value. There are some films I enjoyed but never want to see again (such as Arrival), which might be well done but I have no desire to buy the BD. That ultimately affects my opinion of a film, and that is why I have such mixed feelings about films by M. Night Shyamalan and tend not to buy them. He's a brilliant writer/director who knows how to create a tense scene. But, when the tension is released, it can't be recreated a 2nd time. That's just my personal opinion and how I rate movies. I might give a film like Arrival 5 stars, but never want to see it again nor own a copy.

This prequel to Carpenter's The Thing was well done. I understand the opinions of others and disagree. The CGI was not ""atrocious"" as one reviewer poorly observed. It was actually very well done, and done in conjunction with some real physical effects. You can tell a couple of times but those are the exceptions. And, one might argue that today, it would not be possible to recreate Carpenter's film with such effects because those techniques are a lost art. Well, it's highly subjective at any rate. Being a fan, I may be more forgiving, but in my opinion, being a hardcore fan of the JC film, I found that this one similarly scared me, and repeat viewings continue to scare me. That's a successful horror film in my opinion.

I give this 5 stars because I loved it. I'm a fan of THIS material and a horror fan AND a sci-fi fan as well. I'm subjective. This may not be a 5-star movie compared to, say, The Fellowship of the Ring. Just as a comparison. But films should not be compared directly to each other, nor across genres. How does this compared to the JC film? It's like a kid brother or a son. Son of The Thing. Watch them back-to-back, starting here, and enjoy all of the recreated scenes, and ask yourself, does this film contribute positively? The answer is absolutely yes, it does. Together, it's 3.5 hours of fright and I won't take off stars for CGI or little-known actors or poor character development. I'll just sit back and enjoy it and pick up the popcorn every time I spill it.",1490918400,12,2906,4.75049504950495
4850052,3,B005NYMXIU,"I'm a Kurt Russel fan so I found this movie insulting to his very cool acting abilities. I was a little kid when I watched the original movie with Kurt,and I couldn't help but think that throughout this entire re-make. The movie he/Kurt played in was so similar that it had the same beginning,plot,and ending in 1980 something. But now he was replaced by a skinny girl? Nope! I half watched this movie appreciating a few good days work by actors knowing they did good in this but the original with Kurt Russel is better. Again, this movie was over priced and should have been a 1.00 Red Box decision I should have placed. All in all surprisingly the graphics are as good in the older movie. This movie was okay. Get the Red box version and look up the older one on IMBD with Kurt.",1490918400,,780,4.3493150684931505
4850053,3,B005NYMXIU,"Compared to the two films that came before it, this movie is little more than a shallow and expendable cash-in on an existing horror landmark. On its own merits, The Thing (2011) is a straightforward (read: still shallow), tightly shot, sci-fi horror worthy of a rental or late night viewing on TNT.

The reliance on CGI is atrocious and removes any visceral, primal terror that gives gore-hound horror films like this lasting impact. The characters are equally forgettable and flat, which again removes any impact of their existence as alien cannon fodder. You likely won't remember, or care to tell, the difference between ""Norwegian Man #1"" and ""Norwegian Man #4"" mere hours after viewing. Props are the closing thing we get to characterisation - Glasses Man, Vest Person, Pilot Man. Swap any actor/actress from this movie into another role and nothing would seem out of place.

On the plus side it doesn't take long for the action to start, and once it does it keeps the momentum up in top gear. And even though the CGI creatures lack depth or any sense of dread, they do stick close to the design of the original while testing out new and creative images that stay true to the feeling.

The Thing (2011) is a solid time-killer that should exist to remind you better options are out there, and as a warning on how the overuse of CGI, similar to The Hobbit Trilogy, can ruin even the best intentions. Acting, in essence, as an imitation of stronger, more confident, and better executed ideas not unlike the titular alien from the movie. Don't be fooled.",1490486400,,1556,4.734317343173432

4850081,5,B005NYMXIU,"But especially for Fans of John Carpenter's Classic version of ""The Thing"" (1982) ... Please Note, this is NOT a remake NOR is it a sequel!  This is a PREQUEL; an original story and lovingly crafted film that painstakingly details the history and sequence of events that graphically explain just what happened at the Norwegian's Camp in Antarctica and reveals why the Norwegians are using a Helicopter to chase after and are trying to kill the ""dog"" (the Husky) that runs into the American's Scientific Outpost at the very beginning of John Carpenter's film.

For what it's worth, I saw the Carpenter's film several when it first came out in theaters back in 1982... and I consider myself to be far more than just your average Sci-Fi & Horror film fan (or critic) as I actually have worked in live action film production in Los Angeles for well over 30 years... And as Carpenter's film is among my favorite in this genre, I was pretty skeptical when I first heard that this was being made.

But upon leaning that Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr (ADI) were involved with the Make-Up and Mechanical FX, my skepticism evaporated. If you're not familiar with ADI, they are the guys responsible for the Oscar-winning Effects in Jim Cameron's T-2; Aliens; and a bunch of other awesome FX-laden films. Needless to say, you won't be disappointed!

This is nothing short of an incredible homage and companion piece to Carpenter's film.  Taut, suspenseful and even nerve-wracking at times, it fills in all the gaps and mysteries that are only alluded to in the 1982 film.  Excellent Direction, casting, acting, art direction, editing, lighting, music and absolutely outrageous Special Effects... this is a fun and fantastic journey into the icy unknown.  Here's my suggestion... Get this and (if you don't already have a copy) buy a copy of John Carpenter's film... and then watch them as a ""back to back"" Double Feature to see what an incredible job they did in making this film compliment and ""merge"" so seamlessly together with Carpenter's classic.",1483747200,12,2041,4.8645533141210375

I have all 3 'The Thing' movies and like them all. John W Campbell, Jr's novella 'Who Goes There?' , originally published in 1938, is one the the scariest stories I have ever read.

No one even mentions the original ""Thing From Another Planet"" (1951), which is what Carpenter copied. Anyway, I do like this film a lot. M.E. Winstead is perfect for her role; similar (but not near as good) to ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver) in the ""Alien"" films.

I expected them to do a better job with the walking head and the dogs in the kennel scenes that I loved in the previous version.  I was extremely disappointed with this movie's version after having the benefit of newer technology.",1474848000,,394,4.681159420289855
4850113,2,B005NYMXIU,"The best thing about The Thing, the third - and the least interesting - big-screen adaptation of the John W. Campbell Jr. short story ""Who Goes There?"", is its closing credits.

As the names scroll by, we see a re-creation of the opening images of John Carpenter's exceptional, and exceptionally gory, The Thing, a superior version of the story from 1982.

Carpenter's music, on a sparse electronic keyboard, swells up. It would be a lovely way to end an homage to what many consider to be Carpenter's best film and the best version of this story, which first hit the big screen with 1951's The Thing From Another World.

But the closing sequence used here only serves to remind the viewer that the new film could never measure up to its predecessor.

Set in Antarctica, The Thing is about an alien and very dangerous, um, thing from outer space discovered frozen in ice by a team of hapless scientists. Thinking they have an ancient fossil on their hands, they thaw it out.

Bad move!

The alien wakes up and attacks its captors. It's a stealthy hunter because it can mimic, with perfection, any living creature that it munches on.

The Carpenter film opens as the alien arrives at an American research station staffed by a ragtag group of malcontents lead by Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, and Keith David. It reaches them after having destroyed a Norwegian encampment.

The new film, from Dutch filmmaker Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., shows what happened to the international team based at the Norwegian station when they first uncovered the alien. That team features three no-nonsense Americans, scientist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and helicopter pilots Braxton Carter (Joel Edgerton) and Jameson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).

Unfortunately, they are under the command of a pair of naive Norwegian Ph. D.s played by Dane master-thespian Ulrich Thomsen and Norwegian heartthrob Trond Espen Seim, best known as the titular star of the brilliant detective film series Varg Veum. Sadly, the Scandinavian actors aren't given the chance to shine, and instead are used as bland, cookie-cutter stereotypes.

The problem with the new film is that rather than explore the story from a fresh angle, it follows, virtually beat by beat, the events of the Carpenter film.

The director even uses the perennially disheveled Edgerton and an aggressive Akinnuoye-Agbaje to re-create the shaggy-dog Kurt Russell-Keith David pairing that made Carpenter's film so much fun to watch.

The new film's only fresh contribution to the story is a late scene set in the alien's ginormous spaceship. Even here it fails to achieve originality: The ship looks as if it was designed by an untalented devotee of H.R. Giger - the surrealist artist who created the famous alien ship in Ridley Scott's genre masterpiece, Alien.",1474588800,,2805,5.060737527114967

4850122,4,B005NYMXIU,"The Thing, 2011, is, as mentioned many times earlier, the prequel to John Carpenter's MacReady (Kurt Russell) film of years earlier.

Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), hired on to Antarctica to be part of a team which would dig up a 100,000 yr old buried entity.  Needless to say, said entity is rather bitter about the whole thing and wreaks havoc on the Norwegian Science Station.

The team developing and putting this movie together did so with a great deal of patience as the station recreated Carpenter's work faithfully.  While this may not have been a blockbuster, it will surely cause my sleep to be disturbed for a night or two.",1471132800,,635,4.745454545454545

After I saw it, I saw the 1982 version on HBO and I immediately found it to be a classic and is to this day, my favorite sci-fi movie. I have had to have watched it over 300 times so I remember every scene and every line.
When I heard there was a prequel, I had to check it out.  All in all it was a very good movie, but, there's a but in there.
Many of the scenes explained some of the scenes in the 1982 version, but there were a couple of scenes that didn't make sense at all if it were to be a 100% accurate prequel.  It is still a good movie and I now watch the 2011 version and then watch the 1982 version because the last scene of the 2011 version runs right into the 1982 version. Really cool.

The movie really relies on CGI during some scenes where it shouldve gone the other way, not sure if its cause of budget or crappy film making. The ending was also terrible, no spoilers but youll be left feeling like there should have been more.

4850191,2,B005NYMXIU,"I wanted to like this movie, but it doesn't bring me the same enjoyment as Carpenter's film. While chronologically a prequel, it often feels like a remake. Regardless of whether the rehashing of all-too-familiar elements or overindulgent nostalgia pandering is to blame, there's little in the film that feels like it's own.

The few new elements it has comes across as out of place. For instance the opening where the snow vehicle plummets into a deep fissure was all spectacle and underplayed the importance of finding a spacecraft buried in the Arctic. Even if you try to qualify the scene by saying it character builds the three Norwegians, let me remind you that nothing they say bears any importance later. Heck, I can't even recall their names. Their only contribution to the film was to serve as canon fodder for the monster. This whole sequence could be cut and no one would notice.

The lead doctor is established early on as a villain when he reprimands a subordinate (Kate). During the sequence where he demands a sample drilling from the recovered alien, he displays himself as a man that prides discovery over the safety of his workers. Personally I was expecting this to develop into a power struggle between Kate and the head doctor. Which would ultimately split the crew into those that wanted to capture the creature and those that wanted to exterminate it. Instead he disappears into the background only to pop up at the end as The Thing in disguise. He's a wasted character that should have had a bigger impact on the unfolding plot.

I could go on and on about the issues I have with this film, but I'm cutting it off here. If anything this film makes me appreciate Carpenter's version even more. I'd only recommend this film for curiosity's sake.

Update: 2016/04/05 - John Carpenter's film achieved a wonderful balance between thriller and monster film. Much like what Ridley Scott accomplished with Alien. The sequels/prequels/remakes/whatevers forget that delicate balance and push their scripts too far into typical monster movie territory. Unfortunately this comes at the sake of compelling characters, a genuine sense of threat, and even a bit of mystery.",1458086400,,2182,4.937329700272479

Cons: This is a monster movie not a suspense/horror movie like the 1980 film. While they did do the ""who's a monster"" bit the pacing of the movie was too fast for it to have weight.

4850214,3,B005NYMXIU,"The 2011 ""The Thing"" serves as a prequel to the John Carpenter 1982 movie of the same name. While the love for the 1982 movie is exhibited throughout this 2011 version with faithfulness to details that were only hinted at in  the '82 version, the movie attempts too hard to repeat the isolation and paranoia atmosphere established in Carpenter's version and it ends up with too many glaring missteps that prevent it from achieving what it intended to do. On its own feet, the film is a good scare 'em up for today's crowd-but in the ""Thing"" mythology that was established with John Carpenter's version, it only presents itself as a piece that adds a little backstory but doesn't really give us anything new to further the mythology along. The movie is definitely a work of love by the folks who appreciated John Carpenter's classic movie, but unfortunately it doesn't do anything to push the mythology forwards.",1453248000,,911,4.802547770700637

Now don't get me wrong, it has some flaws, the CGI in some parts, well, could have been tighter. But overall, very good.

4850271,3,B005NYMXIU,"I Gave this one three out of four stars because it was a poor attempt to remake the original. The story line followed the original marginally if you think about it.
Lets take and nit pick a few things.
First the alien ship. In the original John Carpenter movie, they used the Footage from the original 1950s version where they uncover the ship using explosives. The ship was out side when they found it uncovered with thermite if I remember correctly. This version has them finding it in an ice cave. Albeit that might be a bit more realistic considering enough explosives to uncover a ship of that size would have taken up a lot more space on the ice. But simply put, they changed that part. Lets not forget that the fact is that they were using computer graphics in this movie that weren't available to the people during the time period. Creative licensing is ok, but if this is the prequel to the first movie, continuity please. Then there is the poor explanations for the various deaths that Kirk Douglass character found when he and the doctor for the original movie showed up. To easy.
It was a good movie effects wise, but to those of us out there that really enjoyed the original when we were kids. It lacked. If you haven't seen the original yet. See this first, and understand that the original was made in the 1970s. Otherwise you might be disappointed by the follow up.",1440892800,,1381,4.50597609561753

4850284,3,B005NYMXIU,"I saw the original with my cousin Willie. We both had to leave the theater - we were terrified. We were only 8 years old in 1951.  That was the wthe Wilson Theater on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington Virginia.

When I finally was old enough to handle the scares and I saw it on TV, James Garner playing a big carrot didn't seem all that horrifying. It was one of those things where you had to have been there at the time.

By that time I had read a lot of SF and especially John Campbell. I knew that the 1951 film was not a true representation of the themes of his original story. So I was eager to see the new (1982) John Carpenter version. I liked it very much. The 1951 was a 'juvenile' story whereas Carpenter's was a serious adult oriented Sci-Fi film.

Carpenter's film was a thinking man's movie. This movie I'm afraid is just too true to the Carpenter movie.  I would have hoped for some new material or some knew perspective. But no. It was same-old, same-old.",1438992000,,967,4.262295081967213

4850292,4,B005NYMXIU,"As a renowned paleontologist, Kate Lloyd is used to digging things up from the earth, things that once breathed and walked but now are entombed in ice and rock. So when a Norwegian research station in Antarctica asks Kate to come out and help them excavate something they've found, she finds their reluctance to talk about their discovery merely eccentric. Only when she sees the thing with her own eyes does she realize the magnitude of what she is about to help unleash on an unsuspecting world, something that has hibernated for thousands of years within the icy Antarctic ground, waiting to be reborn.

Of course, The Thing 2011 is not the first movie of that moniker. The first was the semi-classic from the 1950s, starring James Arness as the title monster, followed in 1982 by John Carpenter's big-budget remake, widely (and rightly) considered a classic in its own right. The new version is actually a prequel to the Carpenter film, but don't worry about it if you haven't seen that movie. Only a few scenes actually serve as direct ties between the two films, and in most respects our current movie can be watched as more of a remake than as one of a set.

As a stand-alone film, 2011's movie is actually quite good. The Antarctic setting is the perfect environment for carefully constructed horror, and the isolation of our protagonists serves to create a claustrophobic, white-out nightmare in which it is surprisingly easy to believe evil could intrude without warning. Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr manipulates setting and image to great effect, and is smart enough to realize that monsters are often scarier when they are seen less, not more. The special effects are brilliant, however, and when the title creature does reveal itself it is truly a magnificent abomination. There is a lot of blood, so squeamish viewers take note, but the physical horrors are dwarfed by the psychological onesparanoia indeed runs deep throughout The Thing.

The cast is largely unknown, except for up-and-coming starlet Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate and veteran character actor Ulrich Thomsen, the leader of the scientific station who invites Kate to help out with his team's unearthly discovery. Winstead is great as the heroine, competent but vulnerable, resolved when necessary but still scared out of her mind by the terror she is confronted with. Winstead is the heart and soul of the picture, but she gets a lot of support. Thomsen is always reliable, and the rest of the cast makes up for in solid performance what they lack in name recognition. The script is well-wrought andwhile a remake (pardon, prequel) can only be so original, the plot does take some interesting twists that should keep viewers on their toes and give them quite a few shocks.

The Thing is a welcome addition to the science fiction canon. Exciting, intelligent, and scary as well, this is one remakeor prequelthat lives up to its source material.",1438387200,,2932,4.92914979757085

4850298,5,B005NYMXIU,"Without a doubt the best prequel I've ever seen.
I just watched this one first, and am now watching The Thing (1982) as I type this. It ABSOLUTELY ends where The Thing (1982) begins.  The job they did with the accuracy of the camp was like previous reviewers said.  I think its perfect.  Both movies are not comedy horror, they are pure horror, and so very well done.  Both movies have smart characters, with enough curiosity to get them well into trouble.
Its not campy, not low budget, but just plain excellence.

The Thing (1982) with Kurt Russell was one of my all-time favorite movies when it first came out.  I wore out the first disk and had to buy it again.
I'm a female,  and one of the things I enjoyed about the The Thing (1982), was the fact that there were ""no"" brain dead women in it, no ""T & A"" distractions, just plain horror.

The female actress in The Thing 2011, was very very good. She wasn't some silly woman who was afraid to break a nail, and she took matters into her own hands when necessary.

I was so excited to come across this 2011 prequel tonight. I had NO idea it even existed. I just happened to find it by accident as I was thinking of buying The Thing (1982) and watch it again streaming, while adding it to my Amazon movie collection.  You're reviews are great, it made me purchase this movie no hesitation whatsoever.

I highly recommend watching this first before you watch The Thing (1982) and grab your drink, turn out the lights, put the kids to bed, have NO distractions and completely enjoy both movies back to back.  Best money spent in a very long time for me on Amazon.

I don't know if John Carpenter was involved in this movie, but if not, he should be so proud they did such a great job, where he left off.

Enjoy!",1437782400,10,1762,4.316109422492401

It has too much of a modern feel to it (admittedly, that's probably due to all of the painfully average cgi thing hopping around everywhere) and lacks good practical effects and that feeling of isolation one should get from Antarctica.  Also, the thing is too intelligent.  The 82 thing used opportunities it fell into to it's advantage, instinct driving most of it's actions.  This prequel thing creates those opportunities and exploits situations to it's advantage, barely even showing a glimmer of animal instinct.
As a standalone movie, it's decent.  As a prequel, not so much.  If you haven't seen the 82 thing this should be a good watch.  If you have, try not to think about it and it might be worthwhile.",1436745600,,847,4.767123287671233

There was no real explanation as to what happened to those guys other than discovering a alien ship in the ice.

The good and knowledgeable scientist Kate did one good one way of finding out who was real and who was not by discovering that non-organic material could not be mutated and used by the ""thing"".

4850357,4,B005NYMXIU,"This prequel honors the original - both in story and in special effects. The original was purely animatronics. This one used modern animatronics, and CGI's. It often blends the two flawlessly.

The Thing is the same character as the original. The audience only gets a vague idea of the form it was in aboard the ship. It's mainly shown in human form, or mutated human form. The audience watches as massive teeth and claws emerge from seemingly normal human forms, but the terror of the Thing isn't just the shape shifting ability. It's clear that every brain function is cloned - including memories, mental capacities, and emotions. But the audience has to wonder if the Thing does more than copy/mimic. What's most terrifying is the possibility that it's victims aren't actually dead, that their spirits are trapped within the Thing.

The audience sees the ship discovered by accident. Then the Thing is dug up, and taken to the base. Then the alien awakes and attacks people. The fear and paranoia matches the original, no way of knowing whose alien or not. These people never find a way to prove who is alien, only a test that proves who is certainly human.

The climax is powerful and thrilling. Afterwards almost everyone was dead, the ship was destroyed, and the only piece of the Thing remaining was a dog.

The performances are strong and Winstead solidifies her legendary status in fan boy and geek worlds by continually picking projects that showcase her talent while not compromising her integrity. Edgerton has been on a streak with another fantastic performance. Beltrami's score is nostalgic while refreshing. This film is a perfect companion piece to Carpenter's film.

But as movies following in the footsteps of its parents, this one is pretty darn good. I've watched it several times and bought it. So, it passed my first test of a good movie, can I watch again. Time and again watched, you've got better than good! How many Oscar winning films(especially this year, Birdbrain?) have you ever wanted to watch again? I'm sorry weird and inventful still needs to be entertaining.

As for the movie, it is pretty much the same fair as the original with Kurt Russell. This time the genius is Miss Winstead. She tries to get the rest of the man crowd to smarten up, but they will have no part of it, and that's when the mayhem ensues. If you didn't like Kurt's version don't bother here.

Being a huge fan of Carpenters Thing I thought it was pretty cool we get to see what happens at the Norwegians camp and they nailed alot of the details from the 80s version when Macready is walking through that camp.

4850371,2,B005NYMXIU,"I really wanted to like this update of the classic sci-fi horror tale ""The Thing"" (Or more precisely, ""The Thing from Another World"") but with all of the digital special effects and modern film making techniques they have available these days, this film came off as uninspired.  There is no tension, no mystery.  They tell you right up front what they are dealing with and then do battle with it.  It has none of the isolated, ""what's behind that door?"" charm of the 50's version with James Arness, And it does not, in any sense hold up against the 80's John Carpenter classic (which is at this point, IMHO, the ""definitive"" version of the story on film)  MILD SPOILER: The ending ALMOST saves the film by allowing us the one reveal that this is merely a prequel to the 1980 film, explaining the age old question, ""What DID happen at that Norwegian base?""  But again, that is where the 1980 film succeeded.  SUSPENSE.  You were always asking, ""What happened to the Norwegians?  Will the same fate befall our heroes?  Will we ever understand?"" - This version seems content to just explain everything up front, in case modern audiences can't look up from their cell phones long enough to get engrossed in a plot.  I liked the cast, and the film had a couple of moments.  But overall, the film was everything I feared it would be.  Lackluster and disappointing.  Watch the 1980 version and be happy.

4850383,5,B005NYMXIU,"Apparently this movie is about what happened BEFORE the movie which starred Kurt Russell.  Remember at the beginning of the first one where the dog is running and a guy in a helicopter is trying to kill it?  Well that's where the second movie ends.  A guy in a helicopter is trying to shoot a dog that's running through the snow.

Confusing?  I'll say!  :)

I liked the movie, though.  It was spooky enough but had an odd wind down before the dog chase.  The protagonist, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, pretty much faded away and I wasn't really sure what happened to her.  Was she infected?  Did she decide to die to save the rest of humanity?  The last I saw of her...she was sitting in a Snow Cat with the door open.  Maybe I'm supposed to use my imagination on what happened to her.

I finally got to see the spacecraft, up close and how it looked inside.  I gotta tell you...there is no way that spooky Mr. Thing was the only occupant of that craft.  It was just to big and complicated to have one critter doing all the work.

Hmmm...this is probably a lead in to part 3 which could be sandwiched between parts one and two , in the scheme of things.  You might see two more Things encased in the ice at the Rec Center in Rochester, MN and they could pop out right in the middle of a hockey game for some real excitement!  :)

4850384,4,B005NYMXIU,"I'm a little biased since I think the 1982 The Thing is one of the best horror movies ever.  If you're a fan, then I would recommend this one because it does a very good job as a prequel and tying this story to the 1982 version.  The story, action, plot, and acting are all very well done.  Monster effects are quite good and I don't think look overly CGI.  The only thing negative is that if you've seen the 1982 version, then this one does feel a little repetitive - almost too close to the same 1982 version storyline.  Again, its a prequel dealing with the exact same subject matter so this is too be expected, but I found myself wanting the story to ""move along"" since I had ""seen it before"" in the 1982 version.  If you haven't seen the 1982 version, then I still recommend watching this one first, and then the sequel and I think you'll enjoy it even more.",1422748800,,863,4.2317073170731705

The plot is basically the same without anything new. If you never saw Carpenter's film and only this one, then you basically know the plot of Carpenter's in this 2011 film. I could accept the lack of new material if they would have made it as scary and tense as Carpenter's version, but it falls short there as well. Doesn't have the shock and surprise that Thing 1982 had. It's just ok. I had always hoped they would make a sequel to the 1982 movie, and so this ""prequel"" serves as the sequel I guess. I had envisioned that in a sequel they would discover the trashed American base and go from there--uncovering the frozen remains of the victims with one of them harboring the alien (albeit frozen), ready to come alive again. I suppose they could still do this since Thing 2011 is a prequel of the story's events, but they would need something new in the plot as well as capturing the shock and awe of Thing 1982 to make it a successful.",1415923200,2,1085,4.376237623762377

The two movies are similar, in that the teams are fighting a creature that assumes the identity of other biological life forms but differ in only a few small ways. Notably, the test each procures to determine who among them is not who they say they are is quite different and, perhaps, a better choice in the remake. (Oddly enough, both teams, in either movie, seem to suffer from similar a problem when attempting to develop a more suitable test).

What I did like was The Thing starring Kurt Russell.  So two decades later, I was happy to see this prequel come to the theaters.  I missed it at the box office, but did pick it up on Blu-Ray.  This film takes place in the week or so directly preceding the timeline of the 1982 film, and shows the discovery of the alien by a group of scientists, its escape from the ice, and the ensuing struggle between it and the humans.  Part science-fiction, part horror, part mystery and all suspense, I found this film very similar in style and tone to the original film.  The special effects are top-notch, but all the scenes of the Thing are faithful to the 1982 version in terms of detail, colors, grotesqueness, etc...  The one improvement of this film is the two female roles; one major and one minor.  It is rare for a sci-fi or horror film to have females in the most important roles, and this movie pulls it off quite well, with no use of romance or sex appeal to take away from the main plotlines.

As for the package itself... First, this is the same film as the theatrical release.  There are extended and deleted scenes included, but they were not spliced into the movie; which is unfortunate as they seemed to fit the main story just fine.  The visual quality is quite good, with wonderful shots of both the white open spaces, and the tight confines of the human base camp.  Unlike other films of the same genre, there are scenes in the darkness, and scenes in the bright light that show of the alien Thing in all its glory.  And of course we have the standard extras such as interviews with cast and crew, and insights into the creation of the movie.

The cast from the original 1950's science-fiction film would be wonderful (alas...they couldn't begin to dream of the film-maker's
tools and toys in the 1980's -much less the computer-generated nightmares available in the 21st century). If you're the type who
can munch popcorn while watching stuff like this, fine. But i suggest you avoid anything like B-B-Q chicken wings (while watching this one). But on to the story... This is meant to be a ' pre-quel ', meaning; what was thought to have happened before the second re-make of the first story. -which was about a creature (James Arness in makeup and a jumpsuit) that terrorized an arctic
outpost w/ a hot-shot pilot and a lady scientist. They zapped-it with electricity. finally.
  In the 1980's, Kurt Russel and Wilford Brimley got their chance to wrestle with a new-improved thing-and-a-half. Which only pre-
tended to be human (or sled-dog) -or both. Anyway, they decided to use explosives rather than electricity to kill it (or not).
  Now it's 2011, and for whatever reason, it seems urgent that we demonstrate how much better (and sexier) women scientists
are at dealing with creatures from outer-space that can suddenly become anyone or anything at any-time (in no time at all). The
problem they have, is that- once infected, the 'host' (expendable actor-actress) doesn't know until the thing inside needs to save
itself by changing its' form (and killing everyone it's next-to).
  With the advent of CGI, Gustav Dore's illustrations of Dante's Inferno would actually be suitable for Hallmark greeting-cards.
I can think of several types of people & personalities who should not watch this. Small children, for starters. If your Doctor has
prescribed psycho-tropic pharmaceutical medicine, play with your cat instead. If you live alone, volunteer to sell Scout Cookies.
If you have parties, don't serve pizza. (sweet-dreams.....!)",1410048000,,2026,5.315625

4850448,5,B005NYMXIU,"""Who Goes There?"" is the original short story written in 1938 by John W. Campbell, Jr. (as Don A. Stuart) that ""The Thing"" movies are based on.  It is in ""The Science Fiction Hall of Fame"" Volume Two A (1973), edited by Ben Bova.  It is 53 pages long and contains some very interesting ideas, though parts of the story are dated.
Also contained in this volume are ten other short science fiction stories, including H. G. Well's ""The Time Machine,"" ""Universe"" by Robert A. Heinlein and ""The Marching Morons"" by C. M. Kornbluth.  This book is currently available at Amazon at a fair price.

""The Thing"" 2011 is a great movie: 1. Strong female lead with Mary Elizabeth Winstead up to every scene in this movie and 2. The director and screenwriter even came up with a pretty good hook at the end of the movie- the real terror is the Doppelganger ""human,"" looking and acting like a ""human,"" but actually ""The Thing,"" pleading with Kate as a human would.  Carpenter's 1982 ""The Thing"" follows Campbell's story pretty faithfully until the end of the movie, which is different in the short story.",1408924800,,1088,4.616580310880829
4850449,4,B005NYMXIU,"As a HUGE fan of the John Carpenter film by the same name, I was interested to see this movie, if for no other reason than to find out the details of what happened prior to the Thing's arrival at the American base, but wasn't expecting much from it otherwise.  After all, we've all seen how Hollywood can take a great idea and reduce it to 2 hours of pointless drivel.  Having read a number of reviews for this film, both positive and negative, I was set to dislike it. The biggest negative points I read were how stupidly the Thing behaved in comparison to the methodical cunning of Carpenter's creature, how fast it transformed in relation to the original, and that the plot moved too fast and made little sense.  The attack in the helicopter was a pretty idiotic move, and Carpenter's creature would never have attacked the entire group in the open, preferring instead to pick them off and assimilate them one by one when alone with them.  But perhaps, as this was it's first encounter with humans, it realized its mistakes and adopted a different approach in its next encounter.  As far as its speed, I saw little difference between this movie and the first.  The dog-thing transformed in less than a minute, the mouth in Norris' belly opened instantaneously, and Palmer transformed in a matter of seconds.  Also, Carpenter's Thing moved very quickly at times, and tended to shoot out tentacles as well.  I also found few flaws in the plotline and wasn't disappointed by the pacing at all; though it could have been drawn out a little more to increase the tension and suspense, it still worked just fine.  If I didn't get the same sense of isolation and fear as I did from the 1982 version, that can be chalked up to the fact that I already knew what was going to happen.  My biggest question is, if the alien ship was so apparently undamaged that it could be fired up in minutes, why did the creature leave in the first place?  Otherwise, I found little to dislike in the storyline, though the 1982 movie showed the Norwegians using Thermite charges to uncover the ship, and showed no evidence of any tunnel leading to it.  Those are minor flaws in my opinion however.  All in all, while not the cinematic masterpiece Carpenter directed, it was far from bad.  It's worth watching at least once, particularly for fans of the original.  (And yes, I know that Carpenter's version wasn't technically the original, but in my opinion, The Thing From Another World was so completely different that 1982's The Thing is basically its own movie).",1408579200,,2541,4.628062360801782

They catch onto this quickly, and one of them devises a rather ingenious method of figuring out who is a genuine human and who is an alien imposter.  Needless to say, there are not a lot of survivors in this one...",1402012800,,597,4.776699029126213
4850469,1,B005NYMXIU,"Perhaps my opinion of this film is skewed by being a long-time fan of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" who often thought about what transpired at the Norwegian camp prior to the events in the American camp.  As time goes by one aspect of Carpenter's film that keeps me interested is the unknown:  when was Blair infected, what really happened to Fuchs, and who did get to the blood?  Naturally, the biggest unknowns surrounded the Norwegian camp:  what did the creature in the ice look like, how did it escape?

The 2011 prequel of the same name goes to great lengths to answer those latter questions.  The danger in writing a prequel with that seemingly at the forefront is that it immediately lends a degree of predictability:  I know what to expect based on the few facts I have from Carpenter's film.  And the last thing any horror film needs is predictability.  The filmmakers relied on modern special effects to up the shock factor.  The problem with the effects in this film are that they produce a behavior for the Thing that does not correlate with what we know from Carpenter's film: the Thing wants to hide inside an imitation; it's vulnerable out in the open, but will fight if it has to; taking-over another creature requires close proximity and privacy.  The Thing in the prequel literally explodes onto the scene and very quickly establishes itself as a vicious predator, capable of lightning-fast metamorphoses from human to something that would steal every gold medal from Usain Bolt at a summer olympics.

At the biological level, Carpenter got it right.  Replicating billions of cells would require an extended period of time as well as an enormous amount of energy.  With the Thing's metamorphoses representing re-expression of DNA patterns it has ""seen"" before, any such change would also require enormous amounts of energy.  Any intelligent creature knows that such exertions are dangerous since they lead quickly to exhaustion and extreme vulnerability.  Having the Thing instead behave like a famished polar bear in a handicapped seal colony makes it feel too primal.

To be blunt, none of the characters in the film are remotely memorable.  In their desire to cover as much ground as possible the filmmakers established a pacing at which no character can leave a lasting impression on the viewer.  Carpenter's film excelled at producing palpable dread and paranoia amidst a setting that was simultaneously confined and expansive.  The 2011 film does have some stunning views of the Antarctic during the few short helicopter flights, but again the pacing is so fast that there is no real sense of time or distance that impresses itself on the viewer.

At least once a year, at the first snowfall, I hunker down and watch John Carpenter's ""The Thing.""  And every year that I return to that well I walk away thinking about the same questions I posited above.  Matthijs van Heijningen tried to answer some of those questions, but they're not answers that leave me satisfied.  And since he chose to so intimately entangle his film in addressing all those questions it truly does not work as a standalone horror film, either.  Perhaps I should thank him, though:  I've been reinvigorated in my intrigue at the unanswered questions.",1399939200,12,3246,4.920955882352941

This movie tells the tale of the Norwegian camp that is portrayed in JC's The Thing.... so all the stuff that happened before that movie. Who found the alien, who and how they found the big ship, what all the ""part"" and corpse looked like still alive. All that stuff. They did a good job of that.  For those of us that love JC's movie this movie touched on the questions we have had since 1982 regarding what happened at that camp.

So, awesome for us nerds but I think this movie does not stand alone.

4850498,4,B005NYMXIU,"(Spoilerless review) Having just watched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kon-Tiki/dp/B000RWE9YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kon Tiki</a>"", it seems Norway's Viking descendants are still busy exploring the globe.  This time they're in an Antarctic ice-station in a prequel to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". I avoided this movie for a couple years because of bad reviews, and after watching it I'm not sure why. While not as good as Carpenter's version (what is?) and with a few problems, this is still a 4 star movie that works on many levels and should only receive complaints if you're not a fan of the genre. You don't need to have seen Carpenter's movie to watch this in any way.

Pros:
(1) Almost seamless prequel. They paid a lot of attention to detail to recreate sets and to authentically fill in the gaps that led up to the JC film.
(2) Cast a strong female lead that isn't running around in skimpy outfits or showing up in an obligatory shower scene. This was smart too so that they weren't having to draw comparison's to the male MacCready from the JC version. They knew the prequel would fail if it just seemed liked a straight remake, and they successfully avoided that.
(3) Where there were similar scenes they made them different enough to keep your interest.  Rather than do a straight blood test scene like in JC (spoiler alert), they instead have people looking into each other's mouths with flashlights to see who had dental fillings to determine who was human or not.  This was just as suspenseful as the original, and managed to be both ""the same"" and ""different"" at the same time. Great line: ""So I get killed because I floss?""
(4) Several coy references to the ""Alien"" franchise, so there is fun not just comparing different versions of The Thing but also to those movies as well. The female lead is not Ripley per se, but you'll spot the homages along the way.

Cons:
(1) Where the plot did suffer it was because it was trying too hard to account for everything from the JC film.  Towards the end of the movie when dealing with the spaceship is really when it starts to lose it. I think they would have avoided all plot problems if they didn't feel they had to address the ship. But they would have been equally criticized if they did ""pick and choose"" and left something unaddressed.
(2) CGI - While nowhere near as poor as some people claimed (and equal to most 2010 CGI out there), there were two bad shots in particular.  It could also not compete with all of JC's old puppets.  At the end of the day though, so what? Complaints of poor CGI here are overblown, and animatronics were still used in conjuction.
(3) Subtitles - Not really a con in my mind, I only list it here because some have complained about it. The vast majority of the film is in English, and having the Norwegians talk to each other in their own language helped them to keep secrets from the Americans and lend to the distrust/paranoia that is part of the film.
(4) Did it feel a little rushed? To me, yes, but it was still well paced. I like slower movies, but that is not what the market is dictating these days. Would have been nice to see a directors cut, but the deleted scene bonus features don't go far enough in that regard.

The Bluray looks good, the soundtrack works well, and bonus feature wise you have some obligatory ""making of"" vignettes. The commentary overtrack from the director was very worthwhile and I watched it all the way through, providing interesting insight/trivia from both this and the JC film.

Bottom line, this was a better prequel than say ""Prometheus"" was to Alien and overall adds to the franchise. Manage your expectations and enjoy. Now, the real question is who has the guts to make a film that takes place AFTER JCs?",1391904000,2,3790,4.685714285714286

4850519,5,B005NYMXIU,"I first saw this ""remake"" on one of the premium pay channels last year (2012). I had no idea another remake of the 1982 masterpiece was even made. I watched it and was pleasantly surprised...it's not a remake, but a prequel. And even though I hate prequels, this movie is one of those rare exceptions (it is totally story driven and doesn't involve any of the previous cast members).

As a big fan of John Carpenter's 1982 film, I can honestly say I LOVE this movie. It flows seamlessly with the 1982 film version. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate (who's obviously not a basketball fan) was the perfect heroine; fantastic performance as the pretty, bright, strong-willed young researcher.

The action is fast and starts almost immediately with the thing breaking out of the ice. The attention to detail of recreating the Norwegian camp is outstanding, especially the recreation of the freezer room where they stored the block of ice. Just like in the 1982 film. And the guy frozen in the chair with the razor in one of the final scenes. I believe the ax was in the door, not the wall wasn't it? The door Macready forces open when he and Cooper investigate the burnt out Norg camp.

Winstead's acting was top rate. I loved her reaction to the horror of the thing when Juliette transforms and tries to grab her; Kate flees and the thing nabs an unsuspecting victim in the hallway who stepped out to investigate the commotion. Kate slams the door and others rush to the scene; Kate is so freaked out of her mind she can't speak. That kind of attention to detail is priceless. (try speaking a coherent sentence when you're scared sh*tless)

One of my favorite scenes is when Kate performs the alien test (""There's a storm hitting us in 6 hours...we're gonna find out who's who"") by looking for fillings in their molars. ""She's clever"" as the alien impostor says in Norwegian to the other. I love the defensive stare that Peder and Kate shoot back at them.

Another favorite scene is one of the last scenes when Kate and Carter escape the ship and prepare to leave in the snow cat. She starts to lean in to the cab and notices the missing earring. She calmly excuses herself as she puts her pack in the back and returns holding a torch. She explains to Carter how she knew he was human or not. ""Your earring""...puzzled he reaches for the wrong ear...""it was your other ear."" Ignoring his pleas to stop, she torches the fake Carter. Very clever girl.

If you love JC's 1982 movie, then you'll love this prequel. At the very end when the ""Norg"" helicopter sets down looking for survivors...out pops Lars with the HK and the husky jumps out the window and it begins. Queue base guitar. I LOVE it. The only thing missing was a cameo by MacReady from the 1982 film--him stepping out of his shack with the bottle of whiskey putting on his sunglasses as the helicopter buzzes the camp. That would have been even better.",1386028800,,2906,4.568138195777351
4850520,3,B005NYMXIU,"I really wanted to love this movie. It's not that I didn't like what they were trying to but rather the type of movie made didn't match the type of movie it was acting as a prequel for. The original movie was more of a slow burn, mystery type movie, this was in your face and all action oriented. You could just see everything coming from a mile away. Still the acting was done well and as usual Mark Elizabeth Winstead is likeable in her part but you just don't care. I enjoyed it as a nice flick for what it was but just didn't feel the as I did with the original. The last thing that seemed to start things off on the wrong foot is the whole "" We found something and we need an outside expert to look at it, lets dig it up and heed nothing that they say about it."" This seems like the exact smae premise of the atrocious AvP.

As a side note the dog in the original was a huge part of the movie... the nonspoken part that really gave the movie a nice feel to it.",1385942400,,965,3.948717948717949
4850521,4,B005NYMXIU,"John Carpenter's The Thing is an undisputed classic. Now it's a two volume classic. While the 1982 version had an obvious opening for a prequel, the bar for any attempt was high. Not only would it be hard to tell an equally compelling story, but keeping continuity with and maintaining loyalty to the first narrative would be a huge challenge. The first few scenes hinted at a too-modern ""assemble your team"" phase, but the cast quickly snuggled in for the more appropriate confinement of the trapped with the beast theme. I was also worried because the first half of the movie feels like a beat-for-beat pretreatment of the events of the Kurt Russell version, but at a pivotal scene the new protagonist comes up with a different solution to the problem of isolating the alien and from then on everything is fresh, exploring more backstory and frightening consequences of the creature's nature. Best of all, I can't think of a single loose thread in continuity. Everything seen in the Norwegian base in 1982 is explained (though occasionally in haste) in this film. The bottom line is that this prequel makes the original seem like a sequel. If only every reboot, remake, and follow up could fit so well, I'd be much happier at the box office! If you are a fan of the Carpenter classic or like adventure, horror, or sci-fi, go see this in the theater!

4850539,4,B005NYMXIU,"The Thing is not a remake, but a prequel to John Carpenter's cult classic of the same name, where an alien being crash-lands on Earth after a supposed malfunction in its ship. The year is 1982, and a Norwegian team stationed in Antarctica have just uncovered the ship, and the frozen occupant. Recruiting the help of paleontologist Kate Lloyd, the financier of the discovery Dr. Sander Halvorson and his assistant Adam Finch then escort her to the dig site. But after they recover the creature and celebrate, things take a turn for the worst when the being awakens after thawing out, and begins killing the crew one by one. But the Thing doesn't just kill them, it assimilates them, becoming them. So, how do you fight something you can't see?

Directed by Dutch filmmaker Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr., The Thing is a surprisingly well-made prequel that does the original justice, but not in the best way possible. If this prequel wanted to really define the greatness behind The Thing, it would have been longer, taken different twists and turns, but ultimately end at the same conclusion. Instead, it plays out a lot like the original film. When I mean a lot, I mean some of the scenes play out almost exactly like they did in the original, like when the Thing attacks the group after they try to help one of their own, revealing itself to be the injured party. Now while this isn't bad, it still would have been better if they did something more original. The acting was superb all-around, especially the slight show-stealing Lars, played by Jorgen Langhelle. The visual effects were overall good, having some truly award-worthy effects, and some run-of-the-mill effects that were alright, but kept the effects from ranking along side films with some other great CG the same year (Cowboys & Aliens, Real Steel, and Super 8). Though the scene that deserved an award just for the awe-inspiring feeling it produced was the shots of the alien craft starting-up. The effects were and still are some of the best, which is kind of surprising for a $35 million movie. The script was good, nothing award-worthy but living up to the original, and Marco Beltrami's score was just great. Keeping the same theme (which appears in the end credits) from the original, Beltrami creates a haunting and eerie sound-scape that is very memorable and spine-tingling.

Honestly, I really don't get why this movie bombed at the box office. Was it because of the theatrical trailer? Did people actually listen to the critics when the movie came out? If so, that's sad. If you have seen the original or like science fiction/thrillers, get this. I'm not sure that there are many movies that can or have had a prequel treatment that's as good as this.

4850544,2,B005NYMXIU,"I saw that this movie currently had a 4-1/2 star rating. I would rather have just rated it two stars and been on my merry way, but Amazon needs at least twenty words about it. Here they are:

This movie sucked; more than that, it was pointless. The Thing was a perfectly self-contained story; it didn't need a prequel/reboot/whatever. And it certainly didn't need CGI. The crew in this version are idiots, and their dynamic didn't work nearly as well with the inclusion of females as with the all-male crew. If you're going to remake/prequelize/whatever a film, do something completely different without pissing on its memory, as John Carpenter did for Howard Hawks' original. Don't do this.

4850552,3,B005NYMXIU,"First off, lets clear the air here. I've read FAR too many reviewer's call this film a ""sub par remake"" when it is, in fact, a decent prequel. Anyone whose seen John Carpenters amazing version of ""The Thing"" will see this immediately. What the filmmakers did wrong was simply call the movie ""The Thing"". That is where 99% of the confusion lies. They really should have called it ""The Thing From Outer Space"" or something like that to help differentiate it.

That being said, I think the film is a very well done prequel (George Lucas could definitely take some notes on this), although the story is flawed and the continuity between this film and the 1982 source material is not always 100% correct, it is  still a fun exploration of the events that unfolded at the Norwegian camp prior to the Husky escaping and making its way to the U.S Research Post NOR 31 in Carpenter's film. The film begins with the discovery of the creature buried in the ice by a Norwegian research camp and the hush-hush recruitment of several American scientists to research the find. The creature thaws and escapes the block of ice. What is next is a series of events similar to the original film with crew members one by one being assimilated by the Thing, leading up to a climatic showdown at the buried alien spacecraft that crash landed in the ice several thousands of years earlier. The end of the film is excellent as it blends in PERFECTLY with the opening of the 1982 film, essentially allowing you to watch both films back to back almost seamlessly.

All pleasantries aside however, the story is not incredible, and the CGI effects are ghastly to put it mildly (it makes you TRULY appreciate the work that Rob Bottin, and Stan Winston to a much lesser extent, did in 1981-1982). What the movie DOES do, however, is explain some of the mysteries seen at the smoldering remnants of the Norwegian camp as found in Carpenters film (the fire axe in the door, the hole in the wall, the straight razor guy, the burned up two-faced Thing, just to name a few), and although this film is not a tenth the film ""The Thing"" (1982) is, it is a worthwhile watch for fans, if only to help fill in the gaps.

(UPDATE) - After having seen the prequel several times now, I have a couple major gripes to add. First, why is there no mention of the Thing tearing through the persons clothes when they are assimilated as in the first film? They let this major part of the original films plot go by the wayside. Also, why is the Thing so eager to expose itself in this film when in the original film, it wanted to stay hidden, only revealing itself at the last possible moment? The whole sequence on the helicopter didn't make a lick of sense. The Thing was getting what it wanted - it was being taken to civilazation and then for no apparent reason, reveals itself and causes the helicopter to crash? Why? It doesn't make any sense at all.

I appreciate the attempt that the writers and director made at trying to create a seamless transition from one film to the next, but I feel they could've done a much better job of it.",1377561600,3,3088,4.477797513321492

What this movie gives you that that movie didn't was a bit more of an explanation of the ""what"" and the ""why"" of the alien fiend, not that it matters as the film was really about paranoia regarding who we are and can we trust ourselves and others, and unfortunately it doesn't do as good or smart of a job of playing upon, developing, or sustaining the paranoid aspect.  But that's not saying that it doesn't manage these elements and include some good creature effects (I prefer the original's though as its more practical effects carried more weight than the digital effects here).

The winsome Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate Lloyd, the heroine and brains of the picture, and she does a good job though it's not quite believable how she picked up on and understood everything so quickly.  But, again, that's not what this particular film is supposed to be all about.  In the end it is an entertaining flick for the sci-fi fan, not bad, but not an improvement over what has come before either (and it is set up to essentially be the prequel to that film as this film ends with the scene of the dog being shot at from the plane which is how the previous film opened).

The only female in the part of the world, and she kicked butt! I really enjoyed how they tied it so wonderfully to the original - the ending mainly (with the helicopter and the dog running away).

The acting was brilliant, the special effects were very good (not amazing, but still very good), and the plot, although familiar, was excellent.

This is actually the pre-quel to the Carpenter Classic, and it deserves to be taken seriously...  and I will bet big money that it will be taken seriously years from now.

I will take it seriously by throwing out this thought -- the filmmakers of this version had to stay close to the storyline of the ""rights"" they optioned or owned - and that ended up working for their movie because... they are talented filmmakers, but also because in a deeper way the ""repeated"" plot beats make you think about how humans end up playing out the same type of scenarios/reactions when faced with an ""alien"" or ""an outsider"" that upsets the ""reciprocal relationships"" within their ""community.""

This is the perfect ""Double Bill"" for all the people my age who should watch both ""things"" back to back. And for those who are younger -- check this movie out! And then watch Carpenter's ""The Thing"" right after... if your father hasn't already shown it to you... like I did with my two daughters.

Doing a 'prequel' to the Carpenter version set in the Norwegian camp that first finds the creature was an interesting idea but it lacks something in its execution.  I think it might have been in characters--the Swedish, FInnish, and Norwegian actors are quite good but we do not, in some way, really bond with them.

4850576,4,B005NYMXIU,"I can pretty much see how this went down. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" was a huge hit so someone(s) looked at it to see if there was another story in there to exploit. The best bet was to take the story with the Norwegians before Carpenter's story begins. I'm in.

Here's the scoop. The Norwegians find the space ship stuck in the ice near their base in Antarctica and want to do a study. They enlist a young female biologist to help. The creature thaws out, starts to assimilate people and now it's a game of paranoid survival.

This is nearly a carbon copy of Carpenter's piece. It starts with us meeting the crew, them coming into possession of the thing. The thing, of course, escapes and they need to try and figure out who is and who ain't assimilated, along with a way out of the mess. There is a clever turn here on how the assimilated can be detected, but it's mostly what you've already seen. They do a good job in ramping up the paranoia and the turn the goo dial up to 11. The effects are good and the action is smooth.

This appears to be a Norwegian production but, as they targeted it for the U.S., they knew they needed some Americans (well....two Americans and an Aussie) to head things up. This is all very clean and slick but it's better craft than art and, given its pedigree, it's not as involving as I would have liked. I do like it and will see it some number of times more.

4850584,3,B005NYMXIU,"From the very beginning this movie suffers from extremely poor character development.  I can still remember all of the characters' names in the original 1982 classic movie by John Carpenter starring Kurt Russell. I could hardly remember anyone's names as soon as the action begins. I think the director was obsessed with getting to the monters as soon as possible, and neglected to bring the antarctic crew together in a cohesive manner. The director may have done this on purpose to possibly show that the scientific, academic types are rather boring.
In the original movie (1982), Kurt Russell clearly emerges as the true leader amid the chaos of the alien take-over. Kate Lloyd reluctantly emerges as the leader after discovering the cellular structure of the alien creature and its potential for imitating other life forms.  One thing missing from the original movie (1982) is the fact that Kate Lloyd finds the fillings from people's teeth missing when the alien takes over an organism.  This would hace been great to see in the original movie, and would have made it more interesting.
I think this movie had the potential for being a great movie if the proper character development and synergy was colated early on, and if Kate Lloyd's character truly grabbed the role of a definite leader, engaged and as lively as Kurt Russell's original character, MaCready.  Some good old American kick-butt, break-the-rules, action was definitely required here.
The creature effects were very good, and I found them to be scary.  The director should have turned up the suspence dial a little more.  I did see some segways into the 1982 classic.  For example, the fire axe embedded into the building wall, the two-headed creature lying in the snow with the hole in the building wall, and the radio operator's suicide.  The helicopter arrival at the end of the movie contained some minor ommissions.  For example, Lars' headset did not have the initials on the metal band (B.H.S.) I think. And the dog did not look like the one in the original movie. I had to watch this movie since I enjoyed the original one and feel it is a horror classic. The Thing (2011) is not as good as the original, but worth your time to watch it, especially if you did not see the original.

The prequel to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is a perfect example.  I'll start off by saying that I wasn't impressed with Carpenter's film.  Just another 'spam in a can' flick.  But this!  The dialogue is insulting to the cast.  The special effects have me convinced that nothing in this area has moved forward since 1982.  They looked exactly the same as those used in the Carpenter film. The entire cast was boring.  No emotions, nothing to like about them; I reached a point about thirty minutes in that the only reason I would stay with the film was to watch everyone die.  And because this story has already been done to death, there is absolutely NO suspense.  Nothing ever had me wondering what would happen next.  The film is sleep-inducing.  And why is everything so dark?  Most of the time it's impossible to tell what's happening because you can't see anything.  What was the director hiding in the dark?  Evidently not much.

How did she come to that assumption and conclusion?  In the JC version, the crew thought the danger was over after they burned the creature, the little by little we were shown how the creature survived the burning and continued to terrorize, adding to the mystery and suspense.

They could have done it better (see the 1951 approach which was more believable!). This (2011) version, though supposedly a ""prequel"" to the 1982 version. wasn't as good and seemed little more than a rehash of the Russell storyline. Bottom line?

Of course, the advent of CGI gives this film more leaway with the special effects, which are truly frightening. The cast is a major plus, as they all seem to git in with each other and the acting is superb. I especially liked the bit of levity when the Norwegians start singing and dancing to an old Norwegian tune. It was hilarious.

What this updated look at the world of the 1982 JC movie does is reverse engineer all the terrible-ness Kurt Russell and company discovered in the Norwegian science camp and fill in all the shape-shifting bloody blanks.  And this movie does a really good job of that.  Filling in for Kurt Russell this time around is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate, a paleontologist invited to the arctic to helped a group of (doomed) scientists explore a thing they've found in the ice.  From there, it's ""Who Goes There"" chills and suspense.  It would be easy to merely compare this movie to John Carpenter's and find it lacking.  In '82, John Carpenter's nightmare vision was fresh and awful and groundbreaking.  But this new Thing offers its own horror movie pleasures -- a chance to see what happened to the Norwegian camp ... some mechanical effects that are as good as those provided by Rob Bottin in ,82 ... and a first-rate performance by Winstead as the heroine of the piece.  All too often, horror movies rely on the idiotic to propel the plot.  That can't be said of this movie.  Everyone does what we would all probably do, and yet ... well, it's the thing, after all.

Had nothing in common with original, and while there were many gross-out scenes, I didn't find them scary. I also didn't like the characters or the way they interacted.

When I saw the trailer for this new ""Thing"", I couldn't believe anyone would do a remake of a remake, including the opening music. I had no plans to see it.

Then I was offered a free month of DVDs with my streaming Netflix subscription, so I ordered the blu ray version to judge it for myself figuring there was nothing to lose.

I liked it MUCH better than Carpenter's. There were several genuine jump-out-the seat scares, and the creature moved so quickly and with such voracity that it portrayed it in a whole new (and for me, more frightening) light.  Although how this milli-tentacled, crab-legged mouth-on-acid could build anything, let alone a huge spaceship, was and is beyond me.  Seems like a terrible waste of space too!

I liked the female lead, even though her character was written sooooooo Ellen Ripley-esque.  She even looked somewhat like a young Sigourney Weaver.  But I thought the actress and most of the others gave credible performances.

I don't want to spoil it for others, so I'll just say I liked it, and highly recommend it for those nights when only a creepy sci-fi horror flick will do.  Nice twist at the end!",1361232000,,1469,4.655038759689923

4850617,4,B005NYMXIU,"Maybe I was nodding off or having a bad day the first time I saw this film because I remember feeling ho hum about it. The second time I watched it on blu ray I really liked it and became more engrossed in the nuances. I'm a huge fan of the 1982 Thing (as well as the 1951 version)so I believe I come at this being a hard core skeptic. As with the 1983 film this version has a very real dynamic going on between the cloistered players. Mary Elizabeth Winstead impressed the heck out of me portraying an outwardly bland scientist that invokes inner strength when confronted with fear. As well, her fear is genuine.

 Many already know this 2011 version is a prequel. I didn't think the Norwgian camp needed to be revisited but, my predilections aside, it worked very well. Many of the actors are big Norwegian film stars. One was referred to as the ""Brad Pitt"" of Norway in the dvd extras. The film basically holds to what our minds remember the creature being in the ""82 masterpiece and that goes a long way. I do agree with some reviewers that one or two CGI scenes were somewhat weak but it could also be that I am so used to the thing being ""live action"" that the CGI just throws me off for this type of creature. I would also say that some necessary dark scenes leaned a little too dark for me. I also don't understand why the film was given the title ""The Thing"". Remakes are usually entitled the same, not prequels or sequels. This could have been ""The Thing- A Beginning"" or something like that. I think the marketers needed this title to sell it to newer audiences.

The movie doesn't have the memorable lines that the classic has but I can't forget the line, ""be careful, that thing went through the ------ roof"" (lol). Seeing the creatures space ship could have sunk the film but wisely this area was handled smoothly and added greater fascination. Kate's outcome left me a bit more wanting but I can live with it. What needs to happen now is the sequel to the 82 film that many are salivating for. The Thing is not done yet.",1359849600,,2035,4.35
4850618,3,B005NYMXIU,"Paleontologist Kate Lloyd is asked to join a Norwegian expedition in the Antarctic after they uncover an ancient alien spacecraft deep beneath the ice, but when one of the shape-shifting creatures awakens from its icy tomb, she will be forced to determine friend from foe in a battle for survival atop the frozen continent. The 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's classic Science Fiction film THE THING is surprisingly well-made, and serves as a valid companion piece to the original film by filling in the events that preceded it. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and his team of set designers have taken great care in recreating the Norwegian base camp and following the frightful events just as they had been described in the previous film. The one major disadvantage that anyone would come to expect falls in the special effects department. Rob Bottin's ground-breaking make-up designs have terrified audiences since 1982, but the computerized monstrosities found here lose much of their effect despite their nasty appearances. Although THE THING presents several new twists on the plot points from before, the plagiarized ideas border quite closely to making this a direct remake. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her supporting cast do maintain the proper amount of fear and paranoia to make this a successful sequel/prequel/remake, whatever it may be.

The tension was never really believable from anyone aside from Ms. Winsted. She made it better though the only tension was when the Thing was hunting people. Everyone else seemed to be going through the motions. Second, I wasn't sure if I was watching the JC version or a prequel. I thought it was supposed to be a prequel, but it felt like I was watching John's version. Everything seemed lifted: from the test to the wandering in the storm. They did try and alter the test but it all felt too familiar.

I will say I loved the tie in at the end. That partially made the movie for me. Fit very nicely into John's version. Aside from that, this was a pretty mundane creature feature that would have been better served with another name.",1358121600,2,874,4.49685534591195
4850622,4,B005NYMXIU,"This isn't a bad movie overall I would say.  The expectations were high because of the two previous movies that are very highly regarded.

I wouldn't say the plot and writing is the strong point for this movie.  The scientist who leads the investigation, Dr. Sander, is a cold fish who makes the transition from a stuffed shirt academic to a mad scientist too quickly.  He was crazy even before he became the Thing.  In fact it seems like everyone in this movie already saw part 2.

The movie's greatest strengths would be the special effects for the creature and the scenery in general.  It also fills in some of the missing pieces about what happened before John Carpenter's version since this is actually a prequel for Carpenter's 1982 movie.

Carpenter's version was not a sequel to the original but a retelling of the story to match the book 'Who Goes There ?'.  Carpenter's version is a classic but it introduced a lot of subtle and rather vague issues about the true nature of the creature which were not present with the original black and white movie from 1951.

It's never totally clear to what extent someone is aware that they have been invaded by the Thing.  In some cases the person doesn't seem to realize it themselves until their head explodes while in other cases the person seems to be following the Thing's will at all times.  This implies that when the Thing replicates someone it can also replicate their memories.  This makes the creature basically impossible to identify for other people.

In both movies confusing things happen which are really never totally explained.

The Thing that John Carpenter created could never be allowed to get loose in society.  As Dr. Blair figured out in part 2 it would take approximately 27,000 hours or 3 years for the creature to take over the entire human population.  Carpenter's creature is sort of a hybrid between a demon and a virus.

That factor creates a lot of restrictions for making a movie about this monster.  The group always has to be isolated from the rest of the world.  All three movies include a loss of communications with the outside world although in this installment the main scientist arrives from outside already knowing about the flying saucer.  To me this would imply that others outside of Antarctica may also have known.  That was a possible angle that wasn't followed up in this movie though.

The ending of this movie doesn't make any sense to me if we assume that when two people are possessed by the Thing they would both be aware of this.

There were three people involved with the final battle.  One was definitely a Thing.  But the Thing status of the other two was not clear to me.  The ending seems to imply that at least one of those two others was a Thing.  In that case why didn't one of them assist the other Thing to kill the normal person ?

Either that or the lovely but lethal flame thrower wielding scientist made one heck of a mistake.  Maybe she got too trigger happy with the flame thrower I don't know.  She's another mystery in the movie since Carpenter's version doesn't say anything about her.  I guess we'll have to wait until part 4 to find out about her but at the current production rate for sequels that will probably be in 2041.

Anyway something isn't adding up here for me.

I hope the trend of showing parts of movies after the credits have started at the end stops soon.  Someone told me I missed an important part of the Green Lantern because I must have left the theater when the credits started.  I was probably out in the parking lot by the time they showed the part I missed.  Now I don't know what the Hell is going on.

I have an idea.  What about producing a true sequel to the original 1951 version ?  Doing this would create a separate movie series from this one since the two creatures are completely different.

Although I doubt that many movie producers would dare to attempt this unless they have a solid concept.  They would be messing around with a Hollywood legend.

4850625,1,B005NYMXIU,"Let me start by saying how much I loved the original thing, John Carpenter's masterpiece is one of the top horror films up to date. And when I heard they were ""remaking"" it, I just had to see it.

Story: It turns out this film is actually not a remake, but a premake! You''ll noticed this at the end of the film, but was a premake even neccesary? The whole point was that we didn't know what was going on, we didn't need answers, that's what made the original scary. If you ask me this film is just a remake in disguise, most of the events that occurred in the film were the same as the original. The spaceship scene? Don't even get me started with how absurd that was, that was just going too far. Basically they are all stuck together in the artic and are trying to figure out who the next thing is. Personally this film to me would've been better off as a remake.

Acting: The acting was great, I actually had no problem with it. And they didn't choose well known actors, they chose some fresh new meat!

Special effects/CGI: This may be the worst CGI work I have ever seen in my life! It looked like something off the syfy channel. Example, in the beginning during the helicopter scene, when the guy's head split open, it looked like something off photoshop, no, worse! The original film contained anamatronic pupptery, no CGI. Now I don't have a problem with CGI, but at least make it look good. I was not scared a single bit, this was the biggest dealbreaker for me.

Final word: Please do not waste your hard earned cash on this, if you want a real scary film, see the original, this film just doesn't do justice to it.",1357430400,4,1626,4.303921568627451
4850626,5,B005NYMXIU,"This movie is a fantastic prequel and it gets better and better the more times you watch it. There are so many little things from the original that they add into this movie. One example is the axe in the wall in the original, in this movie you get to see how that axe gets there, it just totally blew me away. You can really tell how much care and love they put into this movie to make it worthy of being a prequel to the original.

To get the full effect you really need to watch them back to back, I swear it goes together so perfect that it is absolutely astonishing. Any fan of the original would be crazy not to see this movie. I believe that J.C. is probably very pleased with how much care they put into this movie to really make sure they honored him.

So if you are a fan of the original, or even if you have never seen it you MUST check this one out, then watch the original, you will not be disappointed!",1357344000,11,915,4.021978021978022

4850633,2,B005NYMXIU,"I was really hesitant about watching this movie. The original Thing from 1982 has always been my top favourite survival horror movie. I heard a lot of not so good things about this movie. But I was surprised that I liked this a lot more than I thought it was going to be. The main, huge thing about it that I didn't like was the cgi. There was just no need for it. The original movie was just as effective, and in parts, far more effective...but with no cgi. The acting was pretty good, but I wouldn't have cast people as recognisable as Eric Christian Olsen and Mary Winstead. The entire time, I kept getting memory flashes of other movies those two had been in; Dumb And Dumberer, Sky High, etc. That's one of the things that were so great about the original movie. They had tons of recognisable actors in it, but they were so into their parts that you forgot you were looking at Kurt Russel or Wilfred Brimley. THe best parts of the movie were the great nods to the original movie; the ax in the door, the guy with the slit throat, the ice block, the double-headed Thing, and the very end scenes during the credits. I would have loved the movie a lot more if they hadn't used cgi. I've seen worse cgi, but every time in this movie, you were aware it was cgi.

All that said, this was a decent movie and, as I said, a lot better then you may have heard. It could have been a lot better, though it WAS limited in what could happen, as we saw a lot of what happened in the first movie. They did pretty well with what they had. I really don't think I'll be watching this movie too often, perhaps just at Halloween.

4850644,1,B005NYMXIU,"To cut to the chase immediately:  this movie should not have been made. It should have been left alone for another 30 years. At least by the screenwriter and director or whoever thought up this piece of drivel. What an awful, boring, unimaginative movie. The most suspenseful part are the end credits. It was not until I heard the familiar, eerie original 1982 soundtrack that my heart started beating a little faster.  This movie could and should and was supposed to have been so much better. Its brilliant predecessor (John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name) hit the movie theaters 30 years ago. So the makers  have had aeons to dream up and produce a more worthy sequel (or in this case prequel). They utterly failed. It feels rushed, there's not the slightest build-up of tension and suspense and the characters are made of cardboard. The monster is boring too and without any variation. The film is moronic, full of plot holes and illogical. The team of scientists discover what is the greatest find in human history and they treat it like they just discovered a, well , a rusty bike really. They store it in a shed under a tarpaulin and seem to be much more interested in food and drinks. After drilling holes in it they immediately go about their daily business again. These people are scientists, mind you, not engineers or oilworkers. You really don't care who gets absorbed by the monster and who doesn't. They walk out the door as if they are in a holiday camp somewhere in Norway or Sweden. The milder southern parts of these countries, mind you. The cold doesn't seem to bother them nor does their breath fog up.  The snowcats are deliberately sabotaged to prevent the monster from infesting the populated parts of the world, but when the heroine chases the monster, they are easily fixed again and used as chase vehicle. Making  remakes of classic movies is a very dangerous thing. It is not the 1982 John Carpenter original (which was in itself a remake of a 50s movie of the same name), but this 2011 remake which is in dire need of being remade. Preferably soon. To people who love the John Carpenter original and are curious about this prequel --like I was-- I would like to say: don't bother, it's an utter waste of time and if you do watch it, you will feel so disappointed afterwards. I deliberately avoided reading the reviews in order not to spoil the fun. The film's director, Mr Matthijs Van Heijningen Jr ( a fellow Dutchman if I am not mistaken) might want to consider creeping into the flying saucer buried under the polar ice, hide in a cupboard somewhere and cry his eyes out for this wasted opportunity for at least a decade or so. Because a wasted opportunity this is, if ever there was one.",1352678400,2,2728,4.593429158110883

4850646,3,B005NYMXIU,"All right, it's not as good as the 1982 classic, but it is still a good movie, with interesting effects and a story line with no surprises or nothing new to show.

Kate Winslett did a superb acting job in her role as a scientist who is asked to drop everything and come to Antartica to help with an importantant finding there. We already know what is waiting for her there, so the plot suffers somewhat because there is no mystery to be unveiled.

This movie is interesting because it shows what happened at the Norwegian camp before the alien escaped in the form of a dog and made it to the American base, but as the story unfolds, it is missing the drama, suspense, and tenseness that unfolded in the original movie. The alien is presented with some CGI and some traditional (low-tech) effects, which help capture the flavor of the original. I don't think that CGI was overused, as some say.

As for my criticisms, in the 1882 version, there is a scene where the Americans are watching a videotape of the Norwegians after they found the spaceship in the ice, and then the Norwegians accidentally blew it up with thermite grenades. In the 2012 version, that didn't happen.  The spaceship was still intact, and although Kate blew up an alien inside the ship with a grenade, it apparently didn't completely destroy the ship, but only caused it to power down. So this is an example of discontinuity of plot from the original story.

Another minor gripe is that in a major confrontation toward the end of the movie, the alien took over one of the scientists, and then morphed back into alien form.  There is a scene where the alien grabbed the lab tech and started to merge with him, making a two-faced monster. My question is why did it stay in the two-faced state?  Why didn't it morph into another state instead of staying incomplete like that?

4850648,4,B005NYMXIU,"When I saw the John Carpenter 'Thing' in the theater as a kid, I was blown away. It sent my date into hiding with her head turned into my shoulder for most of the film.
  I had always wondered if someone would produce a sequel so we could know Mac's ultimate fate. Wisely, this was never done ( although Dark Horse comics did produce a series of books as a follow up but I didn't keep up with them ). Hollywood will produce superior sequels, on occasion but, for the most part, they eff it up.

  As a prequel, this movie didn't work for me, at first. I saw it as too derivative. I let it go for awhile. I had occasion to watch it again, recently, and found my initial reaction a little too judgmental. There's room for legitimate comparison. However, I thought about the concept paired with the location similarities and decided, 'why would there not be a fair amount of deja-vu-ness'?
  The finished product can stand on its' own, I feel.
  My only real criticism would be with the film makers vision of the alien craft interior. The mesh of a good mech representation on the exterior vs. the claustrophobic, organic interior was a good idea, just didn't work for me somehow.
  But, that's it. Otherwise, upon viewing it for a second time, I really enjoyed this prequel.",1351728000,,1272,4.463203463203463
4850649,1,B005NYMXIU,"Comparing the 2011 ""prequel"" to the 1982 original is like a masterclass in the difference between modern Hollywood and even the Hollywood of just a few decades ago.

The Thing (1982) was a gory horror/sci-fi film aimed mostly at teens and nerds (or both, like me)  but it has great performances, edgy dialogue, and truly frightening and disturbing scenes.

The Thing (2011) has interchangeable characters who might as well not even have names, by-the-book CGI, no atmosphere, and no suspense. It barely even has the jump-scares that normally Hollywood can be expected to deliver.

In 1982, Kurt Russell scraped hot wires in petri dishes of blood to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.
In 2011, Flavor of the Month Actress #7209 shone a flashlight into the other characters' mouths to see if they had fillings to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.

4850650,4,B005NYMXIU,"It's hard to trump a classic (let alone two classics), and this remake doesn't really do that. And yet 2011's THE THING offers up its own brand of watchability. First, you should know that this isn't a reboot. It's instead a prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 adaptation (which itself is an updating of Howard Hawk's original 1951 version). All three films are inspired by John W. Campbell's novella ""Who goes There?""

It's always appreciated when the lead character manages to keep a cool head in trying circumstances, and especially in a survival horror flick. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays paleontologist Kate Lloyd who couldn't pass up an opportunity to take part in an expedition to a remote research outpost in Antarctica, where a gamechanging discovery awaits. And when stranded members of the international team begin to get killed off one by one in horrifying ways, it's Kate Lloyd who keeps it together. She's the one who best applies her analytical skills. Hunted by an otherworldly predator that can replicate human flesh and so pass as one of them, Kate figures out the one other thing - what with the blood test having been sabotaged - that may penetrate the thing's deception. She uses this rule of thumb to unmask the final alien disguise, a feat that addressed one of my beefs (which was why was she not checking this one certain person?). I need to brush up on my powers of observation, because it was obvious once she pointed it out. So I like that the story lays out the ground rules and then adheres to them.

I've had friends complain that this newest iteration is too slavish in its homage to John Carpenter's version, that the homage veers too close to mimicry. And maybe it's so. I tend to regard this movie as a companion piece, a complementing prelude. To paraphrase the DVD's audio commentary, the filmmakers had to dabble in a bit of reverse engineering. It addresses the shocking sights witnessed by R.J. MacReady and Dr. Copper as they explored the blasted Norwegian camp early in Carpenter's film. That bloody fire axe on the door. The radio operator with his throat slashed. That block of ice with the hollowed cavity. The burnt carcass of a two-headed freak. We learn how they got to be that way. Those poor doomed Norwegians (played by actual Norwegian actors).

A sense of paranoia and distrust permeates the film, naturally. And a sense of melancholy, as well, because, going in, we knew the outcome of this story. I thought the film was good but was undermined by that feel of been there, done that. There isn't enough time given to character development so that when the victims start getting weeded out, there's not enough investment in them, excepting Winstead's competent paleontologist. The f/x crew works with practical effects and CG to flesh out the monster(s) but really does nothing to improve on the 1982 beastie which, back in 1982, was considered a groundbreaking creation. The allure instead lies in watching Mary Elizabeth Winstead breathe life into a sensible Ellen Ripley-type role (and tote a flamethrower) and in that the film allows us to revisit John Carpenter's nightmarish world.

3.5 out of 5 stars.

4850651,3,B005NYMXIU,"I loved the remake of 'The Thing From Another World' by John Carpenter back in 1982, I saw it a year later in 83 when I was 13 and it totally blew me away, sending me into a Carpenter frenzy back then (when his work was still quality with classics such as Escape From New York, The Fog and Assault On Precinct 13 etc........ man I must have watched them until the VHS tapes wore out).

This, whilst it can't seem to make it's mind up whether it's a prequel, a stand alone or even a remake, is actually not a bad sci-fi monster flick if you take it as it is.

Yes, it lacks much of the menace, feeling of isolation and fear of who is and who isn't of the 82 film and yes, whilst it tries to tie in certain parts or explain why and what the Americans find (Kurt Russell et al) when they arrive at the Swede's (they're Norwegians MacReady......;) base later, it then proceeds to make errors in doing so from time to time.

Examples that springs to mind would be the Americans finding video footage (in 82) showing the Norwegians using thermal charges to blow up the ice and thus exposing the ship (the same footage funnily enough used in the James Spader film Alien Hunter) yet in this we see the engines of the spaceship melting the ice and why didn't Russell and his chopper crew find the snow cat that would be left parked next to the ship according to this prequel. Also they clearly have technology here (microscopes etc), well in advance of the Americans in 82.

They make reference numerous times about never being alone with one another just in case one of them is 'The Thing' and yet time and again we see two people undertaking tasks together....huh??!!

What seemed oddest for me and why I mention remake above is that many of the dialogue exchanges and even situations the characters find themselves in, almost mirror Carpenters exactly and I couldn't for the life of me understand why they did this.

The CGI perhaps isn't up to par in realism as Rob Bottin's latex and liquid FX, but whilst not as err.... well.....gooey, it, for me wasn't terrible, just........ different I guess.

Many reviews I read prior to watching, slated the fact the alien appears almost unabashed and pop out at the slightest provocation, however it did seem to become more cunning as the film progresses and this may account for and explain it being more covert in the 82 film.

As I say, there are plot holes aplenty here but most movies seem to have them these days and to be fair even the '82 Thing has it's flaws, but if you watch this as perhaps more of an 'homage' than anything else and really just for an exciting sci-fi alien monster movie then I don't think you will be disappointed.",1350259200,,2681,4.412955465587045

4850655,3,B005NYMXIU,"Remakes are one thing, but remakes masked as prequels to remakes from the `80s? Now that's a whole new ballgame. ""The Thing,"" despite its similarity in title to John Carpenter's cult-classic 1982 film is actually a prequel. But it's also a remake. Make sense? Of course not. Just go with it. The basic premise will sound familiar: a group of scientists holed away in the bowels of Antarctica make an earth (err, ice) shattering discovery that soon proves to be a deadly threat.  It turns out a foreign life-form found buried in the ice is actually a lethal shape-shifting monster that consumes and then replicates its hosts, turning the entire crew on each other one by one. However, this story concerns the Norwegians whose mess Kurt Russell and crew were left to clean up in the original (remake).

So how does it fare when compared to the coat-tails it's riding? Well, it's a mixed-bag, really. While Carpenter's film is notorious for boasting some ground-breaking practical effects that still hold up rather well 30 years later, this version will likely be remember for having quite possibly some of the laziest and most blatantly obvious CGI committed to mainstream cinema in recent memory. There are some truly grisly moments in the film that are virtually neutered by their presentation, which is perhaps the film's greatest short-coming. Granted, it doesn't help that the plot moves so quickly that you never get a chance to get to know (or care) about the crew, but a little more effort spent on making the effects look authentic would have gone a long way.

On the upside, Dutch director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has a strong visual sense that pays off big time. Granted, an isolated snowbound setting almost creates its own atmosphere, but the film does a superb job of immersing you in the bleakness of the situation, much in the same way Carpenter did with his film. Also in the film's favor is Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Death Proof) who is essentially stepping in Kurt Russell's shoes. While her character is barely expanded upon, she brings enough gravity to keep you caring. As the film shows, Winstead is truly one of Hollywood's most underused talents. In perhaps a more refined film, she could be this generation's Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton.

The thing of it is (see what I did there?) that ""The Thing"" is neither a great nor a bad movie. It exists solely to serve a specific fanbase: namely Carpenter enthusiasts who have seen the 1982 film enough that they can quote the characters by heart. To that end, the film feels like a decent piece of fan-fiction come to life. As far as remakes go (and believe me, there's some bad remakes of Carpenter films on the market), this one is on the higher end of the scale. If you can get past the fact that it's essentially the Diet Coke version of a bonafide classic, you might get some thrills out of this new ""Thing.""",1345420800,2,2911,4.747035573122529
4850656,3,B005NYMXIU,"Was really excited to watch this movie. Huge fan of the original and the John Carpenter version. This prequel is related to the latter movie. Other than the special effects there is nothing that approaches the 1982 version. Its hard to buy the prequel premise. It borrows many of the scenes and dialogue from the JC version. Its almost like they were going for a reboot and decided to go down another track. The other issue is the casting. The first 2 movies had great dialogue with a cast that meshed together well. All of the characters in this one are weak, nondescript and completely forgettable. Yes paranoia is the underlying theme. Yet it would have been more interesting if some characters got along better in order to build up to some sort of tension.  Most of the characters are too aloof and underwritten to care about them.  Even with superior effects technology in todays movies, they cant come up to the level of the 1982 version. They seem obligatory and just there to get the scares.

4850657,5,B005NYMXIU,"Another Thing Movie. I own all of them but my favorite was when James Arness first made me almost not make it to the little boys room in time! Lets face the facts with all the fx back then they did a great job, especially when the arm started moving on the table. Now I liked the end of this last one the way they showed that it was the story of what happened to the Norwegians which was the beginning of The Thing of John Carpenter. What we need is the sequel to the end of John's Thing that will be a huge hit I believe and any of The Thing groupies as I am problely are waiting also. The FX in this one were good but the ship was fantastic I thought. The FX for the creatures excellent. And I did like the way the main actor,
Mary Elizabeth Winstead took charge with the flame thrower. She did a great job I thought through the movie. So let's get on the ship and make a sequel the will make you movie makers the big bucks and remember in any of The Thing movies there was no sex so let's keep the subject matter clean for the new generation of The Thing kids.

For example, I thought the Star Wars prequels, now known as Episodes 1 - 3, were watchable but weak.  That was not true with his film.  Admittedly, this film is not as strong as JC's Thing, but its damn good.  If you loved JC's Thing, you've got to have this for the collection to complete the story.

4850660,3,B005NYMXIU,"So this is a prequel to a John Carpenter classic made in 1982. Or some may call it a ""remake,"" judging from the plotline. Whichever it is, comparison seems inevitable as Carpenter's version holds a special place in many fan's hearts. (The original currently scores an average of 8.2 points out of 10 on imdb.) And so many reviewers have already done great jobs, comparing two versions, so I think I will judge the film on its own merits. So how good is this sci-fi thriller?

The story of ""The Thing"" (2011) unfolds pretty fast. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who slightly looks like young Sigourney Weaver) is Dr. Kate Lloyd, an American paleontologist, who is called in by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) for a research project about a recently discovered object that had crashed-landed in the Antarctic about 100,000 years ago.

""The Thing"" has a few scary moments indeed, but the film quickly becomes clich once we learn what the ""Thing"" can do. The visual effects of the ""Thing"" is impressive, but the film shows it too early and too much. Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. (his feature debut) somehow refuses to create a claustrophobic environment that the film's ""Alien""-like scenario seems to need. Instead of that, he opts for a more action-filled storyline, especially in the film's climax, where things look confusing and even silly.

The film is not terrible - at least it is not boring. At the same time, however, ""The Thing"" often looks generic, borrowing bits here and there from other sci-fi thrillers. ""The Thing"" is reasonably entertaining, but lacks creativity and imagination.",1344038400,,1599,4.9812734082397006
4850661,3,B005NYMXIU,"This film is like a tribute to the john carpenter version of the thing. It is a direct prequel to that movie. It's not a terrible movie at all and the main fault I can find with this one is the use of computer effects instead of building monster effects like the first one. I don't see why this is hated by some , it's not a remake in spite of the name. I like the original 1950 version as well and hope for a blu ray release on that one too. The acting is decent and the story is what you would expect from a prequel of the 1982 version.  It is a decent horror sci fi movie and if you have seen the other things you should enjoy this movie. Just don't expect something different. although you do see the spaceships insides in this movie and you didn't in the past versions. It actually has a part in the plot even.",1343779200,,815,4.0

4850663,2,B005NYMXIU,"As a pre-quel to the 1958 and 1982 films ""The Thing"" has a bunch of people in a remote lab in Antartica where a paleontologist named Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"") along with said group find some incredible discovery that is of course something that can change the fate of the world. This discovery turns out to be an alien being that has been encased in ice for years upon years and once its thawed it begins to turn everyone against one another as this being can mimic anyone it touches so who can you really trust?

If you've seen the previous films you know what to expect here, the usual build-up with the eventual creature attacks and the face/off between the remaining characters as they fight to survive. The initial scenes with the exploration and discovery are decent, once the creature comes to life (which doesn't take long mind you) it becomes a typical horror flick. Its kind of a goofy looking monster but isn't nearly as bad as many other sci-fi/horror movie monsters have been.

Personally this is one remake/pre-quel they could've done without, it really doesn't tell much more that we didn't already know. Sure there's a little tension, a few jolts and the acting is ok for this type of flick, Mary does shine as she's one of the breakout stars in Hollywood in my opinion. It doesn't involve much thought as its fairly straight foward and to the point. As stated in other reviews, the last few scenes do tie into the beginning of the 1982 film which I guess was a decent touch. However its really kinda boring as most of the characters are throw away and one dimensional. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",1342915200,,1641,4.578231292517007

4850665,3,B005NYMXIU,"I can understand why many reviews are comparing this movie against earlier versions as it's a prequel. However, I have never seen the original, and I don't remember Carpenter's version very well. With that said, i'm going to review this movie on it's own merit.

The plot is not the most intricate, but keeps the viewer engaged, and drives the movie like a good plot should. The acting is also pretty goood. The problem with this movie is that it relies on overdone action scenes and alot of CGI. There is a strong enough plot here to drive the movie with pure suspense. While the CGI was good, I kinda wish they would have showed 'The Thing' less. All in all, a worthwhile watch if it happens to be on TV. If nothing else, it has sparked my curiosity about the Kurt Russel version as I remember liking it.",1341878400,3,806,4.409395973154362
4850666,5,B005NYMXIU,I have been a fan of this movie forever. I was glade to see they made a new one and I did like it more than most new movies out right now. I am a scifi fan and do watch most of the new scifi movies out and this was one of the best made one's I have watched. I hope they make the next one in this line soon.,1341705600,2,306,3.3857142857142857
4850667,5,B005NYMXIU,"The Thing turned out to be pretty darn awesome by my estimation.  Sure, maybe the original or the other remakes were better than this one but then again, I've either never seen the original (and other remakes) or I simply can't remember them.  They surely weren't as action-packed or suspenseful as this one.

It's about a group of researchers who travel to Antarctica and dig up an alien stuck in the ice.  Well you can probably guess what happens next- the darn thing literally launches itself out of the ice and comes to life in grand, human-morphing fashion!  It's up to the research team (starring the extra cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and their trusty selection of flamethrowers to put out the threat, however there's a catch.

These aliens can actually replicate human beings and specifically, members of the research team, which means the entire team is constantly under careful examination.  If something appears to be off just a *little* bit about their behavior -or the fact that aliens can't replicate the fillings in teeth- guess what happens to them?  As the old Mortal Kombat video game used to say, ""Toasty!""  Time to take out the flamethrower and go to town!

Entertainment starting about 20 minutes in and continuing until the very end- these aliens will pop up around the frozen facility during several surprising moments and wreak havoc on anyone that stands in their way.  I have to admit, the Exorcist-influenced ""crawling backwards"" motion of the aliens was really horrific and terrifying on a personal level.  Added to the fact is that the HEADS of the people the aliens were replicating were always attached to the front of the aliens body, and it's just really juicy and gross!  Remember the scene in the Exorcist when the little girl comes charging down the stairs backwards and her mom screams in disbelief?  Shades of that memorable scene reoccur here, and it's awesome.  I highly recommend this.",1341619200,,1927,4.904320987654321

4850670,3,B005NYMXIU,"In 1982, John Carpenter unleasehed ""The Thing"" and audience were still weepy over E.T. so this masterpiece of suspense and horror got buried under the ice....until it came out on video and now we have the latest update simply titled ""The Thing"" released in 2011. During the original movie, many questions were left unanswered, what happened in the Norwegian camp? How did the Thing looked like while it was still in the ice? What happened to McReady and Childs? Unfortunately, Hollywood likes to take steps back instead of forwards and we will never know of McReady and Childs (unless a sequel is made, hopefully).

The prequel takes place just before the original when a group of Norwegians stumble upon an alien spacecraft buried deep in the ice, the customary grumpy scientist flies to America and recruits the young hero, Kate Lloyd to go and discover what lies underneath the ice. The cast is filled with international stars, which is refreshing, however, if the filmmakers wanted to keep with the original tone set by the first movie, the Norwegian camp probably would have filled with men doing their work just like in Carpenter's film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is one dimensional and unlikable, she is clearly a Ripley clone where you know no danger will come to her and the story is too afraid to cause her any harm other than her hair getting messy, unfortunately there is no strong central character to root for like in the original. The writer tries very hard to tell a compelling story, filled with suspense and horror and sadly misses the point.

I know many reviews compare this movie to the original but is what happens when a prequel/sequel fails to tell a story and keep the audience interested. Everybody in the camp are just victims for the CGI Thing and the visual effects rely too heavily on CGI to convince anybody that the Thing is something to be feared. The Thing's first, brief appearance is interesting and then is never seen again, the rest is just sloppy mash ups of victims and guts. The story leaves off for a sequel but by the end of the movie, you feel nothing for Kate and the writer tries to sneak in the opening scene of the first film in an effort to redeem itself but at the end, it is simply better to enjoy the original and ignore this one.

The Blu-ray does deliver a clear picture and sound,the extra features are worth a look at and the movie looks amazing on a 1080P TV.The Thing's ship looks amazing and the film does capture a bit of the doomed atmosphere of the original, except you can see the Thing a mile coming and all the suspense of where the Thing is hiding among the cast is gone. I do enjoy this movie mainly because it grants us an opportuntity to discuss it's strenghts and weaknesses and it does flow smoothly into the original so you can enjoy a back to back Thing marathon.",1340582400,,2846,4.5984251968503935

4850672,2,B005NYMXIU,"this is a PREQUEL??? while I was no fan of the john carpenter original, it's unavoidable for me to say that making a film with that one's identical plot, face-absorbing scene, some re-used archtypes (I won't grace them or anyone else in this movie by calling them ""characters""), husky (also eaten in a cell), and even title does not a prequel make. ironically, one of the few real differences is the monster. it has the same abilities as the one in the original but looks different. credibility in relation to the first film aside, the movie is formulaic, thinly scripted, and ultimately forgettable. the characters' personalities are barely established, not that they show any personality traits in the film anyway, save for one bit where eric christian olsen says he ""never believed in that &#!@"", referring to aliens, and the guy next to him colorfully says ""I always believed in aliens!"". I will say that the special effects are quite good and the performances fine, especially when the actors have such little to work with. this is because of the afforementioned flaws in the Things's lazy script, which is strictly sci-fi channel original-level. even the generic ""will you go on this mission"" scene happens immediately after the prologue, with seven minutes passed, and not a single conversation taken place. come to think of it, I don't recall a single conversation in The Thing. by-the-numbers it may be, there still are a few scary scenes to be had. the movie finally hits a stride about halfway through, and delivers the goods for a while before slowing down again with the uninspired, ridiculous final scenes. winstead falls down feet by the dozens (you can hear her screaming for a good 7 seconds)and gets up miraculously unharmed. when she is subsequently being pursued by the monster, she comes whithin easy reach of its writhing tentacles while hiding around the corner... still unharmed! (of course in any other movie, the monster would have reached around the corner where she would be waiting at the end of the hall) I call this questionable star treatment for someone I only know about because of Final Destination 3. the real star here needs to be eric christian olsen, a talented and underrated actor who has starred (consistently) in worse films than this. dude needs ambition. or maybe just a new agent. all in all, the thing is a film that will probably please horror fans, especially ones of the john carpenter original. but for everyone else, well, let's just say the people who say things along the lines of ""oh great, another horror flick"" while watching the trailers in theaters are not wrong about this one",1339718400,,2636,4.87305122494432
4850673,3,B005NYMXIU,"I just watched this 2011 version of The Thing and please understand that I have watched and thoroughly enjoyed John Carpenter's version, and I must admit it is my favorite horror movie of all time.

On the plus side, there still is the tension of who is ""The Thing"" that was in JC's version. Also the amount of dumb horror moments is at a minimum. I really only counted 1 ""Why would you do that!?"" that moment that makes some horror movies pointless to watch in my opinion.

Now for some negatives. I am going to call it a HD release. If you have seen the 1982 version you know when all of the key parts are going to happen. It's great that the writers didn't stray to far from the path, but they could have at least gone site seeing in terms of the bulk of the movie. While it is fun for nostalgic's sake, it loses points for being predictable. Also, a lot of the human tension seems to have been replaced by action. It is not to much action to be unbearable, but what make the 1982 version fun was you were coming up with your own ideas on who the Thing was. Not to mention you only saw the thing in a full shot for a handful of times, while in this version seeing the Thing happens more frequently and longer. In The 1982 version I would say 70-30 Tension to action, this made it feel almost 50-50 (-2).

Although it is predictable it is a lot of fun when you see items from The 1982 version make an appearance, such as the Ax stuck in the wooden door.

While I am happy to see that they didn't turn The Thing into an action shooter, I wish they would have at least tried something different. They didn't have much source material other then an ax in a wall but they could have at least gave it a college try to mix it up.

Overall if you are a fan of the 1982 version it deserves a rent. It's fun to see all of the nods that are in this movie.",1339372800,,1847,4.063186813186813
4850674,4,B005NYMXIU,"By calling this movie ""The Thing"" instead of something like ""The Thing Arises"" may have been the main reason why it bombed at the box office. It turns out to be a prequel of ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" from 1982 instead of a remake.

The cast is actually quite good, since the film uses actors who are from the actual places that the characters are supposed to be from, bringing a feel of authenticity in speech, personalities, and culture. The sets' details are done so well they look like the old sets.

Viewers ages 10-15 may find it very scary; others, campy, which compliments JC's film. Die hard fans of the 1982 film may find some minor flaws and parallels that the casual viewer wouldn't notice. It's not necessary to have seen the 1982 movie to watch this one. Make sure to continue through the credits as it has additional scenes which link to the other movie. It's quite neat to see this one and then watch the 1982 movie afterwards.

Pros:
Good story(its the same as the original except you are getting the beginning now)
Special effects(modern technology is great with the right budget as this film had)
Continuity(the story seamlessly flows into the other, and the creature looks the same)
Good acting(none of the actors were cheesy or overdone)

Cons:
Did have a few scenes that were rip offs of the original.

Other thoughts:
I like this movie, it was enjoyable and entertaining. No its not an oscar winner but who clicked on this thinking it was. Its a pretty descent action thriller. Good suspense throughout.  Basically this movie was like watching star wars episodes 1-3, its the same story as episodes 4-6 but you are getting more details about the overall history of the story. If you like the 82 film you will most likely enjoy this as well, you may find a few annoyances but it is entertaining and nostalgic.",1338681600,,1032,4.748603351955308

The other alien duplicates knew their human's exactly. An obvious but overlooked issue by the filmmakers, (but not by Mr. Franchise) and still an excellent movie - almost as good as Carpenter's earlier version.

It's not perfect, i first thought they had too many unknown actors in the lead roles, but over time, they all grew on me. The Thing creature could of been more gory, but for the scenes it was in, it was pretty cool. The Ending in my own mind, is the most perfect ending to a prequel ever. It just flows into the 82 classic flawlessly, when you see the Norweigian Base Camp frozen at the end, and the dead scientists inside, it hit the mark right on cue. I am actually glad they made a prequel instead of a remake of the 82 classic, because they wouldn't have done it justice. 4/5 stars for me.",1337212800,,823,4.15
4850679,3,B005NYMXIU,"My real-time review of The Thing (2011 prequel).  Spoilers abound.

I saw this movie on Blu-Ray shortly after it first came out and while I thought it was OK, it was nowhere close to the 1984 version in plot, acting, or effects.  I feel most of the problems had to do with the big budget and politics.
The movie opens with a team of 3 Norwegians traveling through the Antarctic in some type of ATV.  Two tell a dirty joke while the other watches a radar/sonar screen.  For some reason, there is an unusually long pause after the admittedly funny joke is told before the other guy laughs.  Why?  Is he internally translating?  Are we supposed to think he, or Norwegians in generally, are dim?  Anyways, the guy looking at the screen suddenly says Were right on top of it.  How does he know?  Did they continue going forward until the signal got smaller, then put it in reverse until the signal was at max amplitude? What about left and right?  This wasn't shown.  Suddenly, and Hollywood dramatically, the ice cracks and the ATV falls into a void.  Wedged perfectly between ice sheets, the ATVs headlights point perfectly at what appears to be a ship buried in the ice.  This was a little too dramatic already.  Couldnt they just have found it on the radar, and then dug for it?  The 1984 version did not dramatize normal actions like this, and thats the problem with big budget movies made by committee consensus.  Someone said Make the ATV fall in, it will be more exciting!, and they won the argument.  I want to know how the crew got out.  How they got back to base camp.  They are in the middle of the Antarctic, where every minute is a struggle to survive the inhospitability of a hellish environment.  I don't think they understand this in Hollywood where it is sunny and 70 every day of the year.
Cut to the vintage style The Thing title screen.
Kate Lloyd (wow what an easy name, funny how nobody has ridiculous names in movies unlike the real world) is a scientist studying a 25,000 year old frozen bear.  In walks some Norwegian guy who wants to hire her as the paleontologist to investigate whats obviously been found at the Norwegian camp in Antarctica.  Of course she accepts because the movie couldn't continue otherwise.  OK so I have to ask, in 1984 how many paleontologists were women?  What was the likelihood of Kate being chosen?  It seems this decision was made more due to the success of Ripley in Alien(s) than any likelihood in reality, and also to help secure a female viewer demographic.  But Ripley was more believable because it was the future.
So now they are in Antarctica in a helicopter flying to the Norwegian camp.  The chopper seems to be full of Americans.  The pilot is some black guy.  Was this common in 1982?  Was the average chopper pilot black in 1982?  Everybody is chummy with each other.  Revisionism at its finest.  The co-pilot tells Kate she needs to be quick because a storm is coming and she doesnt want to be cooped up for days with a bunch of Norwegian guys.  Why not?  Would a bunch of American guys be any better?  I guess I do not get what he is talking about.  Maybe he wants her for himself?
They arrive at the Norwegian camp and immediately jump in a Snow Cat (ATV) and head to the crash site.  No sitting down for some coffee and meeting the team.  And how did they get the Snow Cat out of the crater?  Anyways, after about 10 seconds of driving they reach the crater.  Did they move camp to the crater site?  I guess so.  I bet that was a lot of work.
Inside the cave introductions are made, and surprisingly there is another female on the Norwegian team.  How in the world did the original movie have ZERO women?  Hint: this was typical in the military and exploratory missions such as this, but revisionism will tell a different story.  It is also far to well lit (blue glow) in these caves.  It would have been better if it was darker with more shadows.  OMG they just said Kate flew 10,000 miles.  She probably needs some sleep.  Now they reach the ship in a large cavern.  It does not appear to be dug out, but there is a large void above the ship.  Why?  Wouldnt it have been slowly covered by snow and ice over thousands of years and been basically in a big block of ice?  The first movie showed the Norwegians having to use thermite charges to blast the ice to dig it out.  Now it sits in a tidy underground cave.  Now off to see the survivor of the crash, so they go out of the cave to the surface and look down through translucent ice to see the creature about 2 below the surface.  WHY??  Why wouldnt it be buried below 100 of ice, just like the ship was in the 1982 movie?  Why does the ice in that very spot just so happen to be almost perfectly transparent?  For drama!  To make it easy!  So Kate tells the crew itll take a half day to dig it out.
Now we are inside the Norwegian camp and Kate is introduced to the whole crew.  These Sweeds, I mean Norwegians, are pretty stereotypical.  Remember the great and varied (and REALISTIC) characters in the 1982 version?  Well, all these guys are bearded scruffy lumberjacks.  Nobody seems very shocked about finding alien life.  These characters are acting like corporate or institutional robots.  They are not expressing feeling.
As they drive a couple Snow Cats back to the crash site, they pass the black pilot and a couple other guys from the original chopper just hanging around outside (in Antarctica, remember) drinking coffee.  Im not sure if they are American or not.  If they are Norwegian, was there a lot of black pilots in Norway in 1982?  Now we cut to Kate and company in a room with a big chunk of ice containing the creature.  There is an altercation between the Leader and Kate about taking a tissue sample of the creature before defrosting him, which Kate is against.  In private the Leader tells Kate not to contradict him and that she is there just to get it safely out of the ice.  So I guess hes supposed to be the bad guy because he hurt her feelings.  Also ominous music played as she stared at him speechless.  After a crappy job drilling, they bring up what appears to be a small but not frozen sample of tissue.  It seemed wet and squishy.  Why wouldnt it be frozen the same as ice?  It was ice.  It was in ice.  Hollywood people don't know about ice.  Now the whole crew is in the break room partying since Leader has told them that the samples cell structure is unlike anything hes ever seen and they will all be famous for thousands of years.  Oh, also, the ice block is rapidly melting in the other room with nobody watching.  The co-pilot obviously has a crush on Kate.  Unlike the Americans, who had radios and TVs, I guess the Norwegians have to sing their own songs.
Black guy gets done taking a dump and his black intuition suddenly tells him he needs to check on the block of ice, alone.  After some drunk Norwegian scares him (and us) with a surprise BOO!, the alien suddenly jumps straight out of the block of ice and through the ceiling in about 1.5 seconds.  So he runs into the party room and tells everyone, and after initially thinking he is joking they see that he is for real and gather around the now empty block of ice.  OK I know this thing is an alien but I have a hard time believing that something frozen can move that fast, or move at all really.  And how did it know what way was up, or what was happening, or what to do?  Why couldn't they have slowly defrosted it like they probably planned, and then it woke up and started its killing/hiding methods?  Thats what should have happened.  Another Hollywood moment!
Now the Leader has them searching for it in groups of 2 or 3.  They find one of the dogs has been eaten, or whatever.  As I look at the groups walk through the once again well-lit bluish snow and ice, I cant help but wonder if this movie would have worked better if filmed from 1st person.  I think maybe.  Two guys are checking out some noise from a basement window, and we get our first sad CGI kill of the movie.  The alien shoots a terribly rendered CGI tentacle spear through the chest of some Norwegian, which then extends hooks and drags him back to be assimilated.  The whole team runs over to find the creature is now huge, and after shooting it with some pistols it climbs up the inside of the shack.  They throw gas cans under it and light the whole thing on fire with a flare.  After it seems to poop out the guy it just ate, they put the structure fire out with a couple CO2 extinguishers.
Next scene everyone is all sad in the main building.  The Leader says they need to get the remains and study it.  The co-pilot says they should destroy it and they are flying one of the Norwegians who is in shock to a medical base in the morning.  Now they are dissecting the creature in a scene that is very much like one from the 1982 movie.  What is missing is the nauseating smell when they open the creature up, which in the 1982 movie almost made everyone gag.  Kate examines a sample under a microscope to find un-surprisingly that these cells aren't dead.  They show a too-perfect clip of cells attacking other cells.  If you have ever looked at things under a microscope, you will know that this clip was too smooth and made-for-TV.  Instead of immediately telling everyone that the alien is not dead, she just says goodbye to the co-pilot and the sick guy.  In the bathroom she finds bloody tooth fillings on the floor, plus a shower full of blood, and realizes someone is the creature.  Probably sick guy.  In the air we see it isn't sick guy, but some other dude who suddenly turns into the creature and crashes the chopper, killing sick guy, black pilot, and co-pilot. It would have been nice to see more of the struggle aboard the chopper, but we only see the creature attack sick guy.  Why couldn't the pilot land while it was eating sick guy?
Cut to a guy trying to make contact with anyone via the radio.  Of course he cant get anyone because of the incoming storm.  Coincidence I guess.  The American camp is not very far away.  The remaining crew wonder how and why the chopper crashed, and for some reason Kate is not telling them.  OK now Kate is telling everyone what she suspects, and they don't believe her.  For some reason she doesnt have everyone look in the microscope to see what she saw.  And for some reason everyone hasn't already done so themselves.  They are all scientists!  Im not a scientist and Id have already taken a look under a microscope!  Someone has cleaned up the bloody mess in the shower so one of them is an imposter.  But nobody believes her logical story, and that is crappy writing and characters.  The other female is the only one who believes her, and shows her where the keys to the vehicles are stored.  Oh wait!  Shes the creature!  Really horrendous CGI again.  HOLLYWOOD, LISTEN!  STOP USING CGI!  IT ALWAYS LOOKS TERRIBLE AND FAKE!  Kate miraculously gets away but the creature kills some blonde guy.  Out jumps some dude with a flame thrower (are these standard issue in the Antarctic?  Do they use them to melt ice?) and kills the creature.  So far the creatures have generally looked the same as in the 1984 version.  Thats a bummer, because the cool thing in that movie was they never looked the same in any 2 scenes.  And they burn the remains in the snow using kerosene just like in the 1982 version.  As they sit around the creature-fire warming up, they collect their thoughts.  They decide to isolate it and kill it, and also to do the same blood test they did in the 1982 movie.  Somehow Kate seems to be the leader now.  After they sabotage the vehicles, a gruff Norwegian named Lars shows Kate where they keep the grenades.  Suddenly the American pilot and co-pilot stagger into frame, and the Norwegians consider roasting them but Kate convinces them to lock them up until the blood test is ready.  Kates words and actions at this point forward are almost exactly like McCreadys from the 1982 movie.  Someone set the lab on fire which ruined any chance of the blood test, but Kate figures out the Filling Test.  The creature cant reproduce teeth fillings so if you have fillings you are not the creature.  Half the crew are PT (Perfect Teeth), including the Leader.  Lars and some red haired guy go outside to get the Americans from another building and to administer the test on them.  This was a bad idea, as it left only Kate and 1 other non-creature guarding 4 possible creatures.  Stupid.  Should have tied them up.  Lars and buddy find the Americans are gone, with a big hole in their room.  Obviously they are creatures too.  Lars goes to hunt them down but is attacked.  The 4 possible creatures are getting aggressive and suddenly there is a bang on the door.  Kate lets in the red haired dude who says Lars is dead.  There is a crash and they all go to investigate.  It is the Americans, who have Lars flame thrower.  There is a flamethrower vs flamethrower standoff, but then the black pilot shoots the Norwegian flamethrower human in the head.  Dead dudes flamethrower blows up and one Norwegian gets knocked out.  Everyone is gathered in the rec room.  Knocked out guys arms comes off and attacks the red hair guy.  Co-pilot is having problems with his flamethrower exactly like they had problems in the 1982 movie.  Is this typical of famethrowers?  Some guy gets stabbed by a long, too fast, and crappy CGI tentacle from knocked-out guy.  Black pilot shoots it but also gets stabbed.  This thing stabbed through a pool table.  Really?  Slate?  The creature melds with a couple of the dead and runs out of the room.  Kate straps on the flamethrower and gets it working, but forgets how to walk or run so the creature gets away.  She does manage to burn up poor red haired guy.  Black guy dies of his wounds.  Kate burns him up too.  OK now we see Kate and the co-pilot standing in the hallway with a raging inferno right behind them, and they are casually talking like no big deal.  Not even shouting.  Perhaps the green screen wasn't very motivating.  Somewhere in the building we see the creature killing the Leader guy.  Co-pilot and Kate are attacked by the arm creature but Kate lights it on fire.  2-headed creature busts through window and co-pilot runs away.  It follows him into the kitchen and he tries to hide.  OK here is something I don't like about this movie.  It seemed to me that the creature is remaining in a half-and-half state too long.  It can imitate a million creatures on a million worlds, but it never seems to completely imitate anything except humans.  For it to run around in a half-modified state for so long seems wrong.  Why doesnt it finish its change so it is a more effective killing machine?  Having to look through the 4-busted eyes of 2 human heads, upside down, seems like a dumb thing to do.  There are plenty of critters with better optical sensors than humans, including infa-red vision.  Anyways

Right as it finds Mr. Co-Pilot and is about to bull-charge him, Kate walks in and blasts it with the fire extinguisher.  Terrible CGI follows.  Suddenly they hear sound of a Snow Cat taking off and know it is the Leader, now a creature in human form, trying to escape.  Co-Pilot quickly splices some wires together to fix the disabled other Snow Cat and they pursue.  Not very well disabled if a 7-year old could fix it.  Some chit chat in the snow cat.  Kate has absolutely no emotion.  She talks in the same tone the entire movie.  Same facial expression.  Now were at the space ship, still in its tidy ice cave.  The creature entered but left the hatch open, and started er up.  Good thing this ship uses 100,000 year Duracell batteries.  I wonder why it even crashed on Earth, since it seems to be fine.  Anyways, Kate falls into a ventilation shaft and Mr. Co-Pilot jumps down the hatch.  Kate, somehow not killed from falling so far, finds the brain of the ship, or something, but the Mr. Leader giant creature finds Kate but she jumps down a human sized tunnel that is in the ship for no good reason.  The creature grabs Kate out of the hole, but Kate throws a grenade into its mouth and blows it up and Mr. Co-Pilot arrives on the scene.  The explosion evidentally also takes out the ships brain because it loses power.  I notice snow is falling on the ship, and it no longer is in a cave but has apparently melted all the snow above it?  Kate and Mr. Co-Pilot exit the cave and decide to drive a Snow Cat 50 miles to a Russian station (it seemed the American station was close).  As they enter the vehicle, Kate notices that Mr. Co-Pilot no longer has his ear-ring, so is most likely a creature.  Kate tells him this and lights him up.  He makes the creatures noise as he cooks, but I think they should have left that out.  Better to not be 100% that he indeed was a creature; I mean, he could have lost it.  This is something the 1982 movie got right, and this movie fails at.
Kate jumps in the other Snow Cat and then surprisingly the end credits starts flashing.
Spliced into the end credits are scenes of a helicopter later landing at the Norwegian camp, and Lars comes out of hiding armed with a semi-auto rifle.  Now, of all times, the dog from the beginning of the movie jumps out and runs away.  Lars tells the pilot that it isn't a dog and they must get it.  They take off and Lars is shooting after the dog.  For a long time.  Isnt their camp at least over 50 miles from the American camp?  I mean, the Russian camp was 50 miles away, and if the American camp was closer, why wouldnt they want to go their instead (this was during the Cold War)?  They shot at the threw grenades at this dog for 50+ miles?  Hmmmm.  And why did the dog try to run away right as someone with a chopper got there, in front of both of them?  Why not the day before, when nobody was looking???  AND WHERE IS KATE???!  Some people say she froze to death, others say she drove to the Russian base, but why wouldnt she just go back to the Norwegian base to meet up with Lars?
I give the move 3 stars.  Its ok and I like how they tied it together with the next film almost perfectly.  The CGI as always is awful, but Ive seen far worse.  The 1982 movie is a 5-star film.",1337126400,,18183,4.3905734013809665
4850680,3,B005NYMXIU,"Respectful, and nicely mounted, prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 take on the John W. Campbell, Jr. story ""Who Goes There?"" offers decent monster thrills on an old-fashioned level.

The lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as an American scientist whisked away to Antarctica in order to study a Norwegian crew's find of the century: a massive alien craft entombed in the ice...and a survivor frozen nearby, outside the craft. Unbeknownst to Winstead and her mostly nameless companions, once the extraterrestrial thaws out, it's able to swallow its prey whole and reanimate itself in the guise of another life form.

Eric Heisserer's script includes a couple of nice touches that Carpenter and his screenwriter Bill Lancaster missed in the `82 version - namely, that the alien can't replicate inorganic matter like tooth fillings - but for the most part is content to rehash its predecessor's principal set-pieces, thereby serving as more of a remake than anything else. Consequently, fans of the original ""Thing"" are likely to be bored with what amounts to a serviceable, yet uninspired, reworking of scenes from the Carpenter film (the blood test, etc.), though at least director Matthjs van Hejningen visually pays tribute to its predecessor with an effective mix of CGI and Alec Gillis/Tom Woodruff make-up replicating Rob Bottin's legendary work from the 1982 picture. The human element of the film, though, never pays off with threadbare character beats, though I'd be happy watching Winstead in pretty much anything - she manages to be attractive and convincing here, and the only distinguishing element in an otherwise bland acting ensemble.

Universal's Blu-Ray of the 2011 ""Thing"" looks tremendous with a high-quality VC-1 encoded transfer. The DTS MA sound is constantly active with Marco Beltrami's score boasting the occasional flourish of Ennio Morricone's 1982 theme.

We know now more about the UFO, but still the movie left behind the key element of the crash, unfortunately Universal decided not to put this part on the film, overruled the Director.  Listen the commentaries.
The Thing in this prequel is acting too fast, and sometimes the lack of blood gives us hungry compared with JC's version.
The Thing makes sounds not as good as the JC's version, which this can add more tension and suspense in the movie, only the split-face deserved ""the oscar"".
Yes, Split-face is the best part in the entire movie, ask McReady and Doc if you want to know more about it.
Kate gives us more information about the ""aline cells"", and provide us a different perspective on how to know if you are infected, and here we know that Childs is human.
The end is considered, the bridge between this prequel and JC's, it matches everyhting.  A little fast but well enough to continue watching the other one right away.

4850688,3,B005NYMXIU,"The new version of ""The Thing"" seems to have absorbed a lot of Alien"", although the stories are fairly similar, an alien creature infects isolated humans and starts killing them off. Of course ""Alien"" writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett surely knew the original ""The Thing From Another World"" made in 1951 and the original story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, so cross pollination could have been present from the beginning, but it looks like this ""The Thing"" took a lot of its look from ""Alien"".

The plot of ""The Thing"" is close to the 1951 original and the 1982 remake, this ""Thing"" is supposed to be a prequel to the 1982 version starring Kurt Russell. An Antarctic scientific team discovers an alien spaceship under the ice and they inadvertently release an alien that has the ability to absorb and replicate its victims while the others in the camp try to scientifically deduce who the replicated are and to devise tests to prove who is human and who is not while the death toll rises.

In this 2011 version Mary Elizabeth Winsted plays paleontologist Kate Lloyd who is brought in when the spaceship is discovered with an ""organism"" nearby. When ""The Thing"" is released from the ice, she's takes the Kurt Russell/Sigourney Weaver lead of finding ""The Thing"" hiding amongst them. The acting all around is good, there's nothing over the top and all the performances are believable, although by the end just about everybody has been screaming in horror and running down hallways or screaming as they change into ""The Thing.""

One thing ""The Thing"" does that other movies don't do is go inside the spaceship and that's where we see a lot of the alien comparisons, it looks like the set designers for ""The Thing"" were either highly influenced by ""Alien"", H.R. Giger or just had left over sets from the spaceships of ""Alien.""

Despite the ""Alien""/""The Thing"" interbreeding there was a lot of surprises in the story and the action kept the movie moving along without it being rote or formulaic, and there's a little bit of tension, but not too much. ""The Thing"" is for those who haven't seen either of the previous movies and if you have you'll still find yourself entertained and occasionally surprised.

Bonus features include: Directors commentary, deleted scenes, and the documentaries and featurettes, ""The Thing Evolves"" and ""Fire and Ice"".",1335312000,,2357,4.867830423940149

4850690,5,B005NYMXIU,"I know there are a lot of people who did not like this movie and gave it a poor review.  I am not one of those people.  I liked it and enjoyed the upgrades to the 1982 version as well as the story enhancement in the form of a prequel.  The subject matter of not trusting the person standing next to you was at the core of the Carpenter version and was what made it great.  You get that same feeling here, as you expect, and the acting across the board is solid.  There is not a lot of character development explored but there was not much in the 82 version either.  That is probably a good thing because there are not a lot of people left standing in the end so the less you care about them the easier it is to see their fates played out.

You do not have to see the Carpenter version to enjoy this film but for me it helped.  This is especially the case at the end as the filmmakers did a great job of tying this story to the 82 version.  It is such a great transition that watching this movie then the 82 film right after makes a lot of sense and was the first thing I wanted to do.  So if you have not seen the 82 film then watch it right after this one.  Not everything between the two movies syncs perfectly but there is more then enough to make the connection.  There are also a lot of things the two films have in common, again as you would expect.  The sets look the same, many of the scenes feel identical, the creature look is the same although much better with modern special effects.  All of these things make for a smooth transition between the two films going from this prequel to Carpenter's version.

The Blu-Ray itself has very good video quality, not the best I have seen but far from the worst.  The audio is good when it needs to be but this is not an audio track that will match up with a disc like Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol but then again the filmmakers never intended it to be.  Basically the movie plays on Blu-Ray as the filmmakers intended it to and if there is any fault it would be in the way it was made as opposed to any issue with the product.  I love director's commentaries and I really enjoyed the one on this disc.  Not all commentaries are interesting but this one was and I love to hear about the creative process behind what you see on screen.

Overall I really enjoyed this movie and like all films the best way to watch them is on Blu-Ray. I would recommend this one for sure but realize that not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did.",1335225600,,2485,4.105590062111801

After reading all the lackluster reviews for the updated The Thing movie, I passed on the theatrical release and figure I'd wait for the DVD rental. Before picking up on the re-imaging, I thought it might be wise to watch the original 1951 Howard Hawking version along with John Carpenter's The Thing 1982 update.

The Thing from another World (1951)

I remember this B&W classic from my childhood and being creeped out by the huge humanoid monster stalking through the hallways like an unstoppable Juggernaut. You didn't need special effects or sophisticated graphics to turn a man into an alien beast. Giant hands and a helmet, along with good physical acting, was enough to convince anyone back then.

Watching the dialogue now reminds me of the different deliveries and sense of timing actors used in those early days of cinema. The rapid fire speeches gave a sense of military formality, efficiency and added a rushed importance to every line. We have the classic commander who is respectfully chided by his men and who is in full command, but also willing to listen to solid ideas from the men under him. He comes off as not knowing everything, but still being the smartest. Yes, they chose a military officer who uses common sense.

The scientist is still the early clich of wanting knowledge of the unknown and is willing to sacrifice everything - including human life to get it.  To his un-cowardly credit, he is willing to trade his own life in exchange for furthering our understanding of the universe. Of course, he does an ill-advised, morally questionable experiment that does give us our only look into the habits of the monster. In this case, the alien visitor is a humanoid beast that has apparently evolved from plant life and feeds on blood. The sled dogs are fodder and food and have little involvement with the creature besides attacking the intruder early on.

This is a great movie that stands as a perfect example of our early paranoia about alien visitors and invasions. It ends with the memorable line ""Keep Watching the Skies"".

The Thing 1982

John Carpenter takes the basic concept and updates the science while keeping the atmosphere intact. He takes environmental factors like the cold and isolation and turns them into major plot points. He uses a research station as the backdrop and assembles regular men to go up against the threat from outer space. The monster has been turned up a few notches too. The original was a menacing brute and this version pits the humans against a shape-shifting alien that can impersonate any living organism it comes in to contact with. Assimilation after annihilation. Our paranoia over space invasions has been replaced with paranoia over who you can trust as it isn't clear who is friend and who is foe- who you can turn to and who's been turned.

We still have the alien saucer under the ice as the initial point of contact, but even that idea is pushed further as the alien tries to build another ship using spare parts from around the base in order to make his escape. The original alien was pretty smart for cutting the power, but this guy is really sharp (no pun intended). The surrounding cast is composed of well crafted characters and the main protagonist is the helicopter pilot J.R MacReady played by Kurt Russel. The movie has more of a singular focus as we mostly follow MacReady and learn as he learns. Like the best of horror movies, our characters are placed in a near hopeless situation and it's only their spirit and willingness to live that keeps them going. If the original ended with the line Watch the Skies, this one should end with ""watch the man next to you"". This is one of the few times where a remake does justice to the source material.

The Thing 2011

The newest version is listed as a prequel and although the events of this film bring us within a few hours of the 1982 John Carpenter classic, it still feels like a modern translation since several key scenes are recreated. I'm not sure why director Matthijis van Heijningen Jr would choose to helm this movie as his first big release. It wasn't as though the 82 version was dated or The Thing represents some sort of big money franchise that needed to be restarted or reinvigorated like Star Trek.

Most modern horror flicks reply on jump gags where there's a meaningless, but sudden action meant to deliver a quick jolt of fear. It's the old cat jumping out of the cupboard and unfortunately that's the engine behind this movie. It lacks the hard science and joy of discovery from the first movie and misses the `who can I trust?' paranoia of the second. There is a good attempt to recreate that tension, but it falls flat since all the characters are fairly generic. It's pretty much a few random Americans and a bunch of crazy Norwegians. When you compare this cast with stand-out characters from John Carpenter's take, you'll quickly realize why the deaths are meaningless. The writers Eric Heisserer, John W. Campbell Jr. never gave us any personalities to connect with. The main character, a Kate Lloyd played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a fine job as the one sensible character. It's obvious from the beginning that she deserves to live and everyone else deserves to die for being so stupid.

The 1982 Thing did its best to show us a monster that was doing things on-screen that we had never seen before- from growing heads - to assimilating dogs- to, damn, just being gross and scary. The monster in this affair is a multi-lobster-limbed crawler and, I must admit, quite formidable. It copies the big punch-line or becoming a grotesque merging of all the victims it's absorbed, but in this case, it looks kinda silly. When you finally get the payoff of seeing a version of the monster in full light, it's a little disappointing and honestly, non-scary. Still, it does better to deliver the chills than the current crop of disposable horror-flicks Hollywood has been churning out in recent years.

In the original movie, it's science verse the military when the army men want to destroy the dangerous alien and the mad scientist wants to be friends and preserve the monster at all costs. And although that was the same foolish opinion held by the upper branches of the military, it didn't seem so sinister. The 1982 film simply stands us up against a monster we don't understand and survival is the only goal. The 2011 thing brings us another dumb scientist, but you could argue that his interest also lie in a quest for personal glory. ""We May lose this find"" yes, he has a personal interest and is in it for his own immortality and legacy.

The music/soundtrack borrows or pays homage to the 1982 score by Ennio Morricone. Those two ominous tones drop at the very start and at the end of the movie. It makes for a nice wrapper. Speaking of endings, 1982 left us with two characters staring at each other with complete distrust. This is an amazing stalemate and a good way to end a classic. This movie, in perfect step with the younger generation, cannot leave anything to the imagination and we get a big impact. Yeah, I must admit this is a welcome twist.

Overall, I consider the 2011 The Thing to be a good movie. It's worth seeing if you're a fan of the original and the 1982 revisit. The original was a statement of our time and left a marker that exposed how we felt about first contacts. The second was a statement about the human condition and what it would take to break down the bonds that hold us together as a species. This third version details who we are in 2011 and beyond. Simply put: we are creatures that seem capable of holding on to every memory and experience while we refuse to let anything with $entimental value go. Once, we had a disposable culture, but now we have one of recycling: it's all old- fashion, phrases, influences and ideas. The big question for every revisit or re-imaging is what are you going to add? Are you going to give us useful background information? Are you going to develop a beloved character more? Are you fixing technical flaws or enhancing an experience? The problem I have with most rehashes is that the priority lies in bringing us the memorable moments while forgetting to include the WHY as far as why we chose to hang on to those moments to begin with. I think I'm going to watch the 1982 version again. Thank you John Carpenter for including the why.",1334188800,2,8398,4.656545209176788
4850696,4,B005NYMXIU,"I rarely get on the band wagon to express my own opinion about a film. However, I am going to express that the negative reviews that hit this film when it came out and when it was released on DVD and Blu-ray had me so put off, I didn't take an interest in watching this release because so many people said it was a remake.

My mother and I have been huge fans of the original for years, and I, myself, had been waiting patiently to see the prequel and the sequel to John Carpenter's original masterpiece. When she recently insisted on watching the 2011 version I willing went along.

Needless to say, I was happy to discover that this is, in fact, the prequel to the original film. I've heard some complaints about the usage of CGI and the similarities to the 1982 film by J.C., but in all honesty after seeing the film on Blu-ray I cannot find any great complaint with this film. In all truth, I find that I rather enjoyed it and will be adding it to my collection.

While J.C.'s 1982 film is a masterpiece among film and especially horror, THIS IS NOT THAT FILM nor is it a remake of that film.

The reason I did not give this film five stars is because there is, at times, strong sequence similarities to J.C.'s 1982 film. HOWEVER, this in my humble opinion does not harm or default the overall enjoyment of the film.

When looking at this film (the 2011 'The Thing') as the first chapter and J.C.'s 1982 film as the second, there is great understanding as to why they did not do more with the creatures.

I am looking forward to the long awaited sequel to J.C.'s film and hope that bad reviews will not keep that from happening. If in fact they ever do get to make the third chapter in this series, this film is an important connection to what eventually happens.

All in all, my advice is don't listen to the bad reviews and take a chance to at least rent this film if you are a fan of J.C.'s 1982 masterpiece. If you hate it you hate it, but if you like it you'll be pleased you took a chance on it, but don't let the negative reviews put you off.",1333929600,,2053,4.208651399491094

It captured a certain paranoia of the times, made some oblique social commentary and applied a relatively decent budget to an essentially B movie story.  In particular, it showed visually a creativity in effects which had not been seen before - notable for their shot in-camera reality.
This time round, we have the same B-movie story retrod.  Although it is a prequel, telling the story from the Norwegian camp that Kurt Russell and co. visit in the Carpenter version, it hits many of the same beats - the twist on the blood test scene is interesting, for example.  However, we never quite get into the characters or atmosphere of the camp in the way that Carpenter set up, and certainly the tension is never generated in the same way.  There are no shocks and surprises, other than the cheap `make a loud noise to give the audience a jump' type, mostly because the film eschews the sense of distrust caused by a creature that only reveals itself when forced to.. here the creature seems to appear at the drop of a hat.  The effects are (mostly) CG this time round, which I assumed would rob them of their real-feel bite.. and yet, they have stuck closely to the aesthetics of the original so the CG-ness is played down in a way that does them credit.  Although the characters never feel particularly well defined, the cast do their best - Mary Elizabeth Winstead is actually satisfyingly low key and unshowy, and comes across almost Ripley-like in her ability to rise to the challenge, particularly in the final scenes, which edge away from the genre in the direction of sci-fi.  The rest of the cast all look convincing, but we don't feel we know them enough to care much what happens.
All in all, not a disaster then.. just oddly irrelevant and unnecessary.  It's not badly done, one just ends up wondering why do a remake / reimagining / prequel if you don't have anything new to bring to the table?  It's exciting enough, and well put together, but  feels perhaps a little too familiar.  If there are people out there who have not seen the previous version, this will doubtless seem just fine.  To those who have seen Carpenter's version, this is a non-essential retread.",1333843200,,2393,4.9798994974874375

A prequel to the 1982 version of John Carpenter's The Thing, as 2 Americans join a Norwegian camp in the Antarctic and uncovers a Alien spacecraft and Thing that lurks inside.

Is it any good?

What made John Carpenter's version such an amazing film is the trust, paranoia, and the unexpected, in terms of what form The Thing will take shape. Unfortunately, this version relies on one weak clich after another, blatantly copying scenes out of the original, to the point I could telegraph what will happen next. The acting is uncharismatic and The Thing itself uses pretty poor CGI, which appears too bright. Remember the awesome music from the original? Yeah, it's nothing like that in this one, it's mostly generic and forgettable. Which are two words that come to mind, that describes the film as well. It is such a disappointment this film wasn't in capable hands, as the concept of a prequel was good. If life was a game of Monopoly, the writer and director of this film should be sent immediately to jail, not passing go and not collecting 200 hundred dollars.

Best bit?

Saw it at the theatre and fell in love with it from the start, but always wondered what happened to the Norwegians that started all of the drama... Went to see this pre-qual in the theatre's last year and was blown away by their attention to detail in tieing the two events together! Told my wife that as soon as this comes out on blue-ray, I'm buying it and watching BOTH films back to back to get the full experience. Well, I just did this last night and let me tell you, it was AWESOME!!!! They did such a good job on this film!!! And the extra features really help to explain some old questions from the original film.

If you loved the Carpenter version, you'll love this version!!! Be sure to watch them back to back, it's GREAT!!!! Hope they come out with a sequal next!!!! COOL!!!

10/07/2015 - UPDATE to this review:
Just last night I once again watched this PREQUEL and immediately put in Carpenter's 1982 original. Every time I do this, it's a totally amazing experience! I'm still blown away at the GREAT JOB these folks did in creating the prequel! Some have stated that they wished they had not used CG etc. etc. etc. Well, first, it's important to know that in fact they mostly used highly sophisticated props. They only used CG to enhance certain areas where it simply made more sense to do so. I'd have to say that 80% of creature creations are props and NOT CG, based on the behind the scenes footage that comes with this disc. What really amazes me is that they used REAL flamethrowers! If anything probably should've been CG from a safety perspective, it probably should've been this area. BUT, as the creators state, CG flames suck! LOL!! So, there you have it ;) Also, lets face it, only old school people want to see analog. In order to keep in the running and make some $, the majority of the crowd that would go see a film like this today were not even born in 1982! So, from that perspective, you have to understand the business side of showbiz... However, it's clear that they tried to use as little CG as they could, and for that I thank them greatly, coming from an old school dude like myself ;) I think their job on the FX was high quality and superior in craftsmanship. The creature makers were of the level of Rick Baker, Dick Smith, Tom Sevini, etc. SUPER professionals and craftsmen!

I can totally see them do a sequel to these 2 films now, if they wanted to. They could tie in the girl from the prequel to the ""frozen"" corpses at the USA site... etc... totally can see this happening, and it would be correct if you think about it. And in truth, they could potentially even use the original actors from 82, cause those guys really have held up pretty well over the years ;) Could simply ""Thing"" one of them from the start, and move on to new characters ;) Hope they do!",1333411200,3,2863,4.387947269303202

Each was clever in its own way.

4850715,5,B005NYMXIU,"Like a lot of us, I grew up with Carpenter's Original 'Thing'. There was always a hint of Lovecraftian that I felt on the edges of what issues the film actually focused on: here was a disgusting amalgamation of various creatures, which/whose master plan is unknowable. It is a thing of genius and insanity. It defies us to describe it.

Well, they described it pretty well in this, the 'prequel' - a concept that did not sit well with me until I began to see the trailers. Now that I've added this film to my BD collection, the verdict is in (almost; I haven't listened to the commentary tracks just yet. That's tomorrow).

The pros:
 - This prequel is down to the final detail identical to many of the opening sequence of the original
 - This prequel literally leaves off where the first one begins. You can literally watch them all at one go and there will seem to be no noticeable incongruities. It's a 3-hour film.
 - The Norwegian cast is great fun to watch together. Americans are the ones that always much things up, eh? Give her a flamethrower and one grenade, and she thinks she's Lara Croft.

The Cons:
 - There are times that the scenes not only remind us of the ""original"", but even the set designs make me feel like they used the same place for both films.
 - They run a razor's edge on whether or not they showed The Thing too much. It's a coin toss, mostly because the creature designs are that awesome.

As for the special features, they step back up to plate and do almost as good a job as for the BD of Carpenter's film. The deleted scenes are more of scene extensions, and while neat to see it was a smart choice to make the cut. The featurette ""Fire and Ice"" literally has the cast and crew running around set and lightning things on fire for the sheer gigglies of it. The main featurette documents the blending of practical and CGI effects and the film maker's dictum to keep as much of it real as possible.

Where the original was edge of your seat nail-biting mystery-horror, this new Thing is forced. They forced themselves to adhere to the film classic in all ways. In doing so, it makes the film, in my eyes, not stand out on it's own enough. YMMV, but I'll give them this - it's a hell of a fun ride!

>>> EDIT ----- >>> After watching the film again and listening to the commentary, I find I must go back and rate the film at five-stars. The commentary points out both technical goodies as well as Easter eggs scattered sparingly throughout the film. And wouldn't you know it?

4850719,5,B005NYMXIU,"At first, I thought it was a remake of the first remake of the movie by John Carpenter. Only in the end of the movie can you understand that it is not. It's an actual prequel to the Thing.
The morphing of the creatures is not the same as in the remake of the original movie.  I am not jumpy on fantasy/horror movies and I do not like gore. However this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Pros: Amazing graphics (not looking cartoonish or too computerized). Good set of actors (However I didn't love them, they acted good). First, iw as thinking there would be two main heroes through the whole movie. I was wrong. And I was thinking there would be a romance between the main heroes. I was wrong again. It would be unnecessary and there are plenty of other things to show in the movie. Glad that didn't happen. Director seemed to make a good job overall. With minor ''I wish it was different or I wish it was that way''. More and more people will get a chance to see John Carpenter's classic. Since it is one of the best movies I ever saw, I am very happy.
Cons: For 100.000 years an alien didn't seem to be buried deep enough under ice like it's spacecraft. In one scene a guy gets a stick. Question is why didn't they show how he got it. Not too much of a big deal, but they didn't show it. Guess they were really busy or inspired witht the movie. I forgive that. Next is the storm. We didn't see it. It was a good weather all the time. The next thing is everything that goes after going into the speceship. Wish the alien didn't have the face on the front but somewhere on the rib side. That way the humans face wouldn't be the center of everything. It's an alien we should be looking at not the dead human. If we wanted to know who it was we could look on any other side of aliens body. And it was already obvious who turned out to be an alien. The next thing is the grenade part and miraculous. Please, that's too Holliwood. The main actress couldn't have escaped easily and grabbed the grenade and kill an alien. I will not spoil how she saved herself. Watch the movie.
Overall it is enjoyable, very well made movie. I have to give it 5 stars. It's a great prequel and now I really want to see a movie that goes on what happened after John Carpenter's remake. And of course not just some alien movie, but what will inspire us further.

I don't care for the overall casting, no characters are memorable aside from the female lead and the dude that played in Dumb And Dumberer? whatever it's actually called... and he's only memorable because i was annoyed that they cast him until he was killed off then yeah. The CG creatures didn't bother me at all, they were great... the problem I had was basic, the directing... he didn't convey any true sense of hysteria that any normal person or group of people would be exhibiting in this alien encounter situation. The most he gets out of this group of actors is just a type of wide-eyed disbelief and stereotypical fear, let's face it if I was in that situation there would be many moments of outright panic, hysteria that would require yelling and calming others and one's self down, this movie doesn't convey or display any such scenes at all.

It's a good film, but lacks the most import ingredient, good directing drawing upon good actors to manifest a true sense of fear, dread and overall hysteria upon facing the gruesome horrific reality of the situation they are trapped within.",1332201600,,1349,4.789699570815451
4850725,5,B005NYMXIU,"2011's The Thing would be one of the better prequels I have seen for a while.
This movie is immense in detail and articulation. Nearly everything was filmed to perfectly set up the original The Thing by John Carpenter.
The director took this detail down to the ax placement (literally, in order to fit the exact height of Kurt Russell when he would later walk past it). The monster was created using a combination of up to date CGI effects as well as animatronics and make-up in order to give the creatures a more life-like look, be able to stay with what carpenter used, yet still stay with the times.
All in all, this movie is has the classic grotesqueness that only Carpenter could provide from the sounds, transformations, and look of The Thing.",1332201600,,749,4.597014925373134
4850726,5,B005NYMXIU,"I really wasn't sure about buying this. You know, there were no particular known actors and quite frankly I don't trust prequels or sequels. BUT, this is one taut movie. The writing is excellent, and contrary to some of the other reviewers there are no areas of loose plot. I love the monster. It really shows the influence of HP Lovecraft on modern film. The creepiest part concerns the female Norwegian doctor. I loved the short story, loved the original, loved Carpenter's remake and love this one. It is great the way they took great pains to make sure the 1982 film segued into this one. People say the movie leaves us hanging, but I don't agree with that. We wouldn't be here if she hadn't reached safety. By the way, I stick by this review, even though some people seem to hate the movie. I truly enjoyed it and heartily recommend it.",1332115200,,841,4.503267973856209
4850727,3,B005NYMXIU,"This is the least successful of the ""Thing"" movies, yet in many ways the most faithful to the source material, ""Who Goes There?"" (brilliant title). Yes the CG effects invite less investment than the latex kind, but this version seemed to me to best reflect the vision of the alien in the original story. As lame as Jim Arness' get-up was in the Howard Hawkes version, that film had crackling good dialogue and suspense. The Carpenter version was good, pulpy fun, but I found the creature effects a noisy hodgepodge and sympathized with Kurt Russell's exasperation at the end when he tries to blow it up. This latest version was diverting, but not as endearing as the previous efforts.",1332028800,2,684,4.756302521008403
4850728,5,B005NYMXIU,"This is the prequel to the 1982 classic horror movie of the same name.  A group of Norwegian and American researchers in Antarctica discover a buried alien spacecraft.  Not far away is an alien body entombed in ice.  They take the body back to their camp, and soon discover that the alien is not only alive, but extremely dangerous.

  The Thing has the ability to shape-shift and infect other living beings, taking them over on a cellular level.  Once taken over, a person will still look, act, and speak the same... until he decides it's time to sprout tentacles and attack.

  A good horror movie is more than just gore -- there's suspense.  Who's been infected?  How can you tell?  The researchers must figure this out and stop the Thing before it reaches civilization.

  I'm a member of the generation that saw ""The Thing"" in 1982 at too young an age.  I had nightmares for weeks.  We've all been waiting for ""The Thing 2"" for a long time, and this film delivers.

  The producers deserve credit for being so faithful to the John Carpenter movie.  Often sequels and prequels are decried by fans because the writers go off in ""new directions"".  (Look what happened to ""Doom"" and the ""Highlander"" sequels, for example.)

  No, for this movie they studied the Norwegian camp as it was shown in the Carpenter film, and meticulously depicted how every little detail came to be -- right down to the axe in the wall!  And they made the movie end right where the previous one starts.

  While the film has parallels to the 1982 movie, it adds new material as well.  The researchers discover more about what the Thing can and can't do, and they see the alien spacecraft in more detail.

  Many reviewers complained that there was too much CGI in the film.  If you watch some of the ""Making of"" bonus material, you'll see that there was not as much CGI as you may think.  The creatures' bodies were made of good ol' foam rubber and puppetry.  CGI was only used to create difficult limb movements, tentacles, and transformations.  The ""problem"" was that the puppetry was so good, it was hard to tell where it ended and the CGI began.

  The one problem this movie could not surmount is that they didn't have Kurt Russell.  Mary Winstead does her best in the leading role, but she lacks the toughness of a Sigourney Weaver.  Hey, not everyone can pull off a convincing fight against infectious aliens in an enclosed space.

  The Thing 2011 is faithful to the 1982 movie, but also holds new surprises.  If you're a fan of the Carpenter flick, you should definitely see this.",1331942400,,2568,4.579646017699115

The Thing #1 ~ original done in 1951 was in black and white, had no special effects, great plot,  acting was good and it all equalled a great movie ~ the one that gave James Arness the break he needed to get into the movie business (it was his first role).

The Thing #2 was of course quite a bit different with the added special effects, Kurt Russell and a very feasible story line.  A good movie.

An utter, volatile, disrespectful and tasteless CGI contaminated horror film, that disrespects the GREAT works of John Carpenter and Howard Hawks.

I will not give the effort or the energy to review this suspense-less, class-less film. And i apologize to even call this extremely high budgeted, soul-less, disgraceful, shallow piece of commercial nonsense a ""film"".  This seems to be the direction which the modern horror film is headed; a place where money is wasted... Like this present day  American administration that bails out the banks and steals the crumbs from the working poor, thus, so does Hollywood, spend multi millions of dollars just to make a profit. This ""prequel"" would have been in such better hands with a dedicated film student at your local college, who would have put his or her heart and soul into this concept.. and very well might have succeeded.

It seems that like the Banks that have destroyed the trust and commitment of the American people, the corporate film industry has deceived and betrayed us as well. It is very clear that in so many aspects of our lives, all big businesses have no regards for the masses that fatten their pockets.

Think I'm being extreme? Well, look at these four and five star reviews for this movie, and tell me they aren't written by those who are financially connected to this failure..

I should at least thank the theatre for having a matinee, it would have been a crime to have paid $12.50 to view this.

4850734,4,B005NYMXIU,"Director John Carpenter of 1982's The Thing should be proud. The 2011 version of The Thing is a prequel to Carpenter's version, and 2011 Thing Director Matthijs van Heijningen (who???) pays tribute to Carpenter's work by creating the Arctic Norwegian Camp story that immediately precedes the events in Carpenter's film.

Carpenter's The Thing is one of my all time favorites and has several moments that are just stuck on my brain. Who will ever forget the dog metamorphosis, the blood jumping out of the petri dish or especially ""the head-spider""? And what about the burned up, half metamorphed creature that Kurt Russell and his crew find at the Norwegian camp...well, you do indeed find out the origin of that ""Thing"" in the 2011 film and it is done brilliantly.

So the 2011 film takes place in 1982 hours before the 1982 film begins. The Thing 2011 basically is somewhat of a Norwegian Camp redo of the same kinds of horrors that befell Kurt Russell's American Camp. But like I said earlier it was all very well done. The Norwegians find the spaceship and ""the escape pod"" encased in ice, they let it melt, the beast is unleashed and, voil, it's dj vu all over again in reverse.

The cast of The Thing 2011 is mostly as little known as the Director with the exception of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But they all do a great job making you feel like you're right there in the cold, Arctic camp with them in a real situation. There's tons of action & thrills and I was completely entertained from start to finish.

Now if you've never seen Carpenter's 1982 version, it's completely unnecessary to see it in advance of the 2011 version. In fact my son had never seen Carpenter's, and after showing him the 1982 version after we had watched the 2011 version he asked, ""Why would I want to watch the second part of the story first?"" So if you're new to The Thing franchise go ahead and grab this film as a warm up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-of-the-best-sic-fi-horror-flicks-of-the-past-30-years/dp/B001CW7ZWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one of the best sic-fi horror flicks of the past 30 years</a>. And if you're a fan of Carpenter's The Thing, but you're concerned that this movie will be a blasphemous injustice to a classic, you'd be depriving yourself of what is a very cool upfront to one of our favorite movies.",1331596800,,2368,4.942211055276382
4850735,3,B005NYMXIU,As this was a prequel that came out 20 yrs after the original it was an interesting take. Not as dynamic as the Kurt Russell version though,1331596800,,139,4.185185185185185
4850736,3,B005NYMXIU,"Based on a story ""Who Goes There"" by John W. Campbell Jr., this is the third effort to convert an excellent Sci-fi story into movie form.

Original story: We find that thousands of years ago a rocket crashed and was buried in the Polar Regions.  It was found due to a magnetic disturbance. On extraction there is an accident.  We find a being from another world and another time.  The being has powers of deception and shape shifting.  Yet the story is not really of supernatural beings as it is of the people and their relationship to each other. As with many great mysteries it is always the last person you suspect. That is one of the strong points of Sci-Fi, not the technology as it will come about soon enough; what it is really about is how we deal with our fellow humans under duress.

The first film effort was in the fifties with the movie ""The Thing from another World."" Naturally it complied with the monster movies of the time and starred James Arness in a veggie suit. It was lots of fun, spooky and had some of the original electrical devices from the book. If you like fifties sci-fi, do not miss this one.

This effort was made as a prequel to the1982 Carpenter version when the monster moved from veggie suits to cheap graphics. The graphic tradition is kept on this presentation. There was a need for the story to be fleshed out and Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. did better at portraying people as people than Carpenter did.

Still the story was fluffed out with Carpenter esque story telling and misses the point of the book and the film spends too much time with blood and guts to focus on the people interaction. Sure there is some interaction or we would not have a movie at all.

The thing in the book was psychic and could read and manipulate minds which the film overlooks.

 In this movie e have an organic way to determine who intruder is that is different from the Carpenter movie's detection methods.  We end with the beginning of the 1982 version.

Just a note: they supply subtitles for the parts that are not in English.",1331510400,,2060,4.475935828877005
4850737,5,B005NYMXIU,"John carpenters cult classic ""The Thing"" is considered a horror masterpiece, and it is for good reason. Its dark, atmospheric, creepy, scary, and suspense that grabs you by the scruff of your neck and refuses to let go. I guess you could say the Thing gets ahold of you, and you never forget it. Supported by great acting and superb directing, it's easily, if not the best horror film ever made. Period.

The 2011 prequel is set several weeks/months before the John carpenter classic begins. It revolves around the Norwegian camp that MacReady and the doctor visit in the beginning of the carpenter film. Where we see the ""Split-Face"", the man who slit his throat, and the ice block where the ""Thing"" broke out, as well as the camp being burned out and disheveled. The film for the most part, is a great prequel and one of the best I've ever seen. Certainly gives the star wars prequels a run for their money.

It has a mix of CGI and practical special effects. On Blu Ray the movie looks great, and way better looking than in theaters. The special effects look more polished and realistic, and the use of practical effects and realistic models blend well with the Carpenter classic.

Much like the carpenter film, this movie does a great job of setting up an Eire of mystery around who really had the ""thing"" inside them, and who's really human? It's handled fairly well, and does keep things intense and within the tone of the film. However there some continuity issues going into the carpenter film, and some within the 2011 film itself, but they really don't effect the overall film, and can be explained by the ""Thing"". But fairly minor overall.

The acting is handled very well, and pretty believable. Everyone did a great job, and it never got bogged down into bland uninterested characters, it kept the characters within the situation and seriousness of the subject matter. So overall I was thoroughly surprised by its quality and attention to detail from the Carpenter film, as well as telling its own story. I really suggest giving this movie a try, and if you have John Carpenters ""The Thing"" on Blu Ray, this really is a great complement.",1331337600,,2150,4.6798941798941796
4850738,5,B005NYMXIU,"I watched the original The Thing and now this one and I really enjoyed both equally.  I will agree as with everyone else the CGI was used a bit to much.  If they had made some gore scenes without CGI showing the alien it would of added some additional fear factor.  I still at times got freaked out but there is just something about CGI which the mind can tell is fake and it detracts from the shock part of it.

The movie over all was worth watching still and descently well done.  Now days they are bringing out so many bad movies that watching this was refreshing to finally be gripping my seat once again in suspense.

Over all I would recommend this movie provided your not anal about every detail in a movie.",1331337600,,714,4.2518518518518515
4850739,4,B005NYMXIU,"This movie got panned by the critics, but I found it to be a decent horror movie, at least as good as Carpenter's. The only problem is that it's not the ""original"", it pays homage to it, and so there are many similarities. But if taken on its own, it's as good, except if judged by ""freshness"" or ""originality."" Then it falls when compared to Star Trek's or James Bond's reboots. The way to enjoy this, then, is to forget you saw Carpenter's version. Until the ending credits, that is.

But it's actually fun to see them recreate what happened at that smoldering outpost that Kurt Russell's team finds later. Kind of like the other other reboots mentioned, seeing things click into place.

You know the plot. Our heroine, Kate, is invited to be on the team for a mysterious discovery by famous, cold-scientist type Sanders. His chilliness is part of the horror, in small ways. The Americans in the team of Norwegians add a note of xenophobia later. The story is the same, with the addition of a fresh, new way to ""out"" the Thing. The ""testing"" scene is full of tension as each person gives off a suitable aura of menace. Most of the characters are likeable, even for the short time you get to know the poor schmucks.

The requisite gore is there, although not as icky as reviews led me to expect. Well, your opinion may be different. I suppose it's the type of violence that matters. There are impalements, but no (human) dismemberments, as I recall, so that's ""toned down"" in my book. There are still some disturbing moments, such as the terrible intimacy of one absorption during a long, panicky scene (when the flamethrower chokes, of course - but not before recreating an iconic image from its ""sequel""). There are some surprises and new creatures, although after a while the larger ones look similar due to their toothed, gaping maws.

Generally, the shock value is diminished if you've seen JC's version, but they manage to pull off a couple of good scares.

The ending wasn't as neat as I'd have liked, and didn't quite tie in as well to the ""series"", but it still provided a clever twist.

I liked it. That's all that matters, right?",1331337600,,2141,4.591623036649215

Another reviewer here said this new remake was TOO faithful to the original so I said to myself ""With 21st Century Technology, this should be freakin' AWESOME!"".
Well to my surprise, in many ways, it started out as being pretty darn close to the original, then it got to the point where they brought the creature in the block of ice into the installation and what happened afterwards when I realized that the person who reviewed this must've turned the movie off in disappointment because this movie then turned away from the original Thing and takes on the remake of Carpenter's.....Just bumped up a bit I imagine since I never really saw Carpenter's in it's entirety because I am guilty of turning off the movie in disgust early on but I now have Carpenter's version on my DVR and will be revisiting it soon enough.
This Newer version is pretty darned Gory and makes for some interesting viewing. It does, however, what the Original ""THING"" never did and that's replicate anything human it touches, but I know that's what Carpenter's version did but in the Original version, it did need blood to multiply via seed pods, which is basically the only variation on how the Thing ""procreates"" in the remakes.

John Carpenters 80's The Thing was his Sistine Chapel (I'm still not the same after seeing it and that was 20 years ago). He based his version off of the original book (if you don't know it look at my first sentence) not to be confused with the 50's popcorn sci-fi flick The Thing From Another World. Carpenter also played off of the cold war paranoia going on in the 80's. It was pure raw genius. This Thing based its premise off of every other pointless sci-fi horror flick. Hot female lead Check, Lots of violence Check and a monster check. Too bad that whole plot Thing missed them.
If you're going to re-make (actually a prequel) a movie then be bold and fresh about it. The Thing is neither of these which begs to question, who goes there?

Maybe I'm off base because after all they did get a quality script writer in Eric Heisserer (A Nightmare on Elms Street 2008 & Final Destination 5). Opps my bad I guess they didn't. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. direction was a white out void of emotion. His biggest fail was not creating that feeling that the walls were closing in on our cast.
The only reason to bring the Thing to the screen again would've been to give the audience another portion of what they loved about the original. This flick failed to flesh out the everyman for himself paranoia. There were no moments that were so revolting that you simply couldn't look away. It was more jack in a box scares than a total freak show that messed with your mind. The only thing messed up about The Thing prequel was how bad they messed it up.

Acting (Ambivalent): The acting wasn't horrid. It's just none of characters were really engrossing. This was mostly due to a rushed script that gave no depth to rich characters. They traded depth of a few characters for plenty of back ground characters. Most of whom lacked a pulse. Once the killing starts it turns into, oh that guy died who was he again? Plus most emotional scenes lacked a proper response from the surrounding characters. E.g. tons of serious drama is going down around me but I'll just follow orders as if it all hasn't quite registered yet. Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) the lead scientist was poorly fleshed out and came across stale. Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) played the now overdone heroine (ever since Aliens every sci-fi horror movie does this, sorry Ripley was a one of kind). Her character was forced but she gave it a go and she's eh. Carter (Joel Edgerton; terrific actor in good movies) plays the American helicopter pilot hero (R.J. MacReady wannabe; if you didn't get that then shame on you) and he's also eh.

Script (Yak): Pitch, lets remake a cult classic. We'll steal the title (I would have gone with ""Who Goes There?"" But hey that's me) and recycle what we shouldn't from the original (you know flame throwers, blizzards and tough helicopter pilots). Oh yeah and were going to have badder fast moving monsters and a few inconceivable plot twists. Sigh... the problem with this pitch is that along the way they forgot what really mattered. What made the 80's Thing great was that feeling that the walls were closing in on you. That gut check moment of if we don't stop it here the whole world is done.
Also Things move way too fast (this is true no matter how you take it).

The best parts to the script were the very very very end and very very very beginning. Their method for testing if someone was the Thing was well thought out but that's really about it. Overall it's mostly just another sci-fi slasher without the gratuitous nudity (I'm not pro nudity but B slasher flicks at least know what they are and aren't). This Thing doesn't know what it is.

My other grip is when a movie is a prequel/sequel for a universe but they totally don't fit in that universe (most notorious offender is George Lucas). The whole premise that an American team went to the Norwegian camp was lame. We didn't need an American female lead but most importantly we didn't need any Americans. Plus the Thing at times doesn't pounce on potential victims when it could. This made no sense other than to create that big plot twist moment.

Special Effects (Nothing Special about Digital): Special effects in the 80's looked real (Empire, Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner, The Thing, Aliens & Terminator). I appreciate what digital effects can do but they can't do quite a lot. The Thing uses them often which really mucks up the moment by taking us out it. When a monster looks fake you stop living the scene and start to analyze how silly it looks. This NEVER happened in the original. The effects fell short because they lacked the brutal nature of actual monster props, gallons of blood and puss plus the realness of hand crafted latex creepers (When they burn they look real unlike their digital cousins).

Music (where are you): Bum bump bum bump flat line. The heart beat music wasn't here until the last scene (I think the start also but it was brief). That's the best part of the music and it wasn't even used. Wow bad call in a movie full of bad calls.

I wasn't sure what happened to the female at the end, she didn't look like the suicide, and how Lars made it to the end for the tie-in I'm not sure, either.  But their logic and ideas were better than the Russell gang, even that fingernails on the chalkboard blood/heat test.
I love the 59 Hawks' version the best, though they are not really the same films due to the alterations from the story in the the first version.  Still, the dialogue and repartee are so good it's funny and hilarious.  The 80s film with Russell was too dour, and the shirt tearing thing was stupid, as if that meant anything.

I can't even begin to guess how many times I have watched that one.

Mild spoiler alert:  I liked the largely Norwegian cast.  I liked the alien special effects.  I liked the spaceship scenes.

I missed Russell and Brimley (they definitely ""made"" the earlier version for me). I think that it was a very smart idea in this movie to have a female protagonist - one that wouldn't ""compete"" with Russell.

4850765,4,B005NYMXIU,"After watching the movie and reading some of the reviews, I felt obliged to write a review for a pretty faithful adaptation, though billed as a prequel.  Obviously, there are some folks who loved John Carpenter's version and have slammed this version. The problem is that some of the descriptions of the flaws in this film were often even more so in the 82 version.  I have never cared for the characters that Carpenter creates.  They are terribly cliche'.  also, when I watch Kurt Russell in the The Thing, I feel I am watching 'Snake' Plissken re-vamped in the Antarctic.  for this film, I think they did a pretty good job connecting this version to the 82 story line. In addition, I think they even paid homage to the 1951 version (how they found the ship--- as well as having a scientist who cares about science more than welfare of crew).  That said, John Carpenter was much better in creating suspense and tension by slowing things down to where the silence is deafening.  Also, the soundtrack this time was devoid of suspense--and music adds quite a bit--could you imagine the original Halloween without the score?  That said, I think they did a pretty faithful adaptation and there was not as much gimmiks with the gore IMO (remember Docs hands in the 82 version? c'mon! how silly).  It is tough to get close to many of the characters in this film I must admit. I would have also liked more time spent with the scientists examining the ship(was the alien the commander of ship, or a specimen picked up along the way..as suggested by those involved. Let's also remember that the 82 film was severly panned by critics and film-goers and subsequently was his biggest flop up to that point. It seems time made his film a cult.

4850766,1,B005NYMXIU,"When they say `this is not a remake', it! is! a remake of Carpenter's film minus everything that made that film decades ahead of its time. The 2011 film and the 1982 film are companion pieces?  Why watch the same film twice with different actors? The only difference is the dog chase is at the end of one and the beginning of the other. The 2011 THING is a film that gleefully throws the intelligence of its viewers into a snowpit to soon be charred by its flamethrower.
It's a prequel but changes events from Carpenter's film defeating the purpose of being a companion piece. The Thing `11 has the alien burst out of the ice block to avoid showing what it looks like. The bizarre alien transformation scenes from Carpenter's film are in this new film less gradual and spectacular and decidedly more instantaneous, inauthentic and a blur of motion.
The director cut out Colin's death scene and we're left thinking, `Why isn't this in the film?'
The expectations for a horrifying ride where we witness the Norwegian camp turned into the war zone Copper and Mac eventually visit sink like a Snocat plunging into an ice cave. The Norwegians aren't underdeveloped characters, they are spectators in what was supposed to be their story. The focus is placed on American characters. Yes, American characters. The alien in an ice block isn't the only unexpected visitor arriving to the Norwegian camp. Norwegians travel halfway across the world for a novice paleontologist, as an excuse to import American characters back to their camp.
This film cheapens the `82 version because it shows the alien lacking cunning or intelligence. It is not the same deadly adversary portrayed in the '82 film. It is not a worthy adversary when defeated by its own ineptitude.",1329696000,23,1752,4.820598006644518

Is this third version as good as the other two, no.  Did I see it as a prequel, no.  To me it just seemed like another botched attempt at a very good story.  All three left out the best part of the novella, the human angle, and a really terrific ending.  But, you have to take things as they are, not as you'd wish them to be.  In this case, I wish this movie had taken more time developing characters and not just a high body count that was impossible to count.  I wish they had introduced the discovery of the space ship in a better light; no wow moment there because you can't see what it is.

The Thing is not a bad film, bringing many of the effective elements from John Carpenter's version and adding a few of its own scares to keep the audience on its feet. The casting works, the pacing is brisk and generally it makes for an entertaining horror flick.

Where it goes horribly, horribly downhill is during Act 3 (after the camp is destroyed) and we get into a ludicrous ""2 Americans on an alien ship"" routine. The showdown makes Will Smith uploading a computer virus in Independence Day look like the conclusion of The Usual Suspects.

4850773,2,B005NYMXIU,"The best I can say about this movie is that I liked it better than the 1951 ""Thing"". It strikes me as not so much a bad film as one that tries to be two things at once- in this case a sequel and a remake- and does neither well.  I see the following as particular problems:

1.  The final scenes supposed to tie this film to the 1982 original simply don't make sense, either in relation to the earlier film or the events of this one.  I personally would need another viewing just to sort out who was even still alive.  This is the most obvious indication that the filmmakers would have been better off to drop the prequel pretense and just let it be a ""remake"" that could stand on its own.

2.  The sequel v. remake conundrum shows even more in the conception of the creature.  As other reviewers have been pointing out very consistently, the Thing here doesn't act at all like the 1982 Thing.  In the earlier film, the Thing is a model of caution and stealth.  Here, it seems hellbent on eliminating or assimilating everyone as quickly as possible.  As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with this revisionist take on Thing behavior.  The problem for me is, it just isn't done well.  The speed of the Thing's onslaught doesn't leave much room for tension, never mind character development.  There isn't a sense of the Thing progressively revealing itself, as the first transformation of human to thing is little different from the ones that follow, and we see the ""original"" form (by far the most weakly conceived!) at the start.  And, ultimately, this Thing just doesn't seem like an effective fighter.  Like the 1951 creature, it can't seem to come up with a better strategy than rushing straight at a human.

3.  I was disappointed in the use of Mary Winstead. Her character has the potential for a symbol of changing gender roles (the most promising subtext of the 1951 film), and one can at least give this film credit for letting a woman's competence and character speak for itself instead of pushing her into a romance subplot or a heavy-handed feminist manifesto.  But, ultimately, she isn't given that much to do, and at times the story comes perilously close to pushing her into the ""passive victim"" stereotype.  I must also say, Winstead herself doesn't convey the same energy or charm that made her stand out in ""Scott Pilgrim"".

4.  Finally, I think the helicopter landings in the storyline are significant deviations from the ""set-up"".  If anything unifies the original story and the first two films based on it, it is a sense of isolation and claustrophobia.  This film clearly tries to have the same quality, but having helicopters repeatedly coming out of the sky goes a long way toward defeating it.",1329264000,5,2726,4.643006263048017

4850775,2,B005NYMXIU,"*Warning* This review is spoiler-tastic

If you completely ignore the existance of John Carpenter's The Thing than this movie would probably be seen in a better light, but alas it's in the shadow of it's 80's predecessar. Since around 2004 a few writers considered another film to add to the Thing's series, ultimately settling on a prequel. They took a long time to write the script, and gave it to the Strike company who produced Dawn of the Dead, so things (LOL PUN!) looked pretty bright huh? Then the director said while there was a woman as the star, there would be no ham-fisted love story and the effects will be practical, and the cast will be largely Norwegian, staying true to the original. Wow! Hopes were high for this, well lets take all of these promising features and apply them to the finished product.

-Prequel: it made sense to make it a prequel, there was some room for a sequel to the Thing but it could've gone horribly wrong since everyone in the original is presumed dead. Could've been really really stupid so they played it safe, and although the end is predictable the journey there can be entertaining.

-Strike Company: this is where the problems come in, while the prequel seemed like it was getting loving care and detail to polish it up Strike decided to rush the production, meaning all the effects turned into CGI, which was lazy and stupid. The story itself is also rushed, aside from Kate, the white American pilot and the jerk boss Sanders we don't know anything about any of the other characters, and they're all hard to distinguish from each other which is a real shame because they all look like good actors.

-Norwegians: The original script called for an all Norwegian cast, as it was a Norwegian camp, makes sense right? But the production company wanted more 'MURICANS so the stupid xenophobic audience can relate, so the half of the cast that matters are Americans, while all the Norwegians are treated like death fodder, being largely inconsequential to the plot. Oh and the one single Norwegian that doesn't know English happens to be the one that confronts the Americans in Carpenter's version. Veeeeery coincedential.

-Starring a Female!: Sigorney Weaver has shown that a woman can kick ass in these kinds of films, but there shouldn't be some corny Grrl Power message thrown in. There was in here. Throughout the film you see that Sanders and Kate have a slowly building rivalry, and at some point in the film he talks with the other Norwegian superior literally saying ""looks like the woman is in charge now"". Do we really need this in sci-fi horror movie the Thing? We're not watching Sex & the City here, and of course at the end Kate has a dumb showdown with the monster who happens to have Sander's face still intact, in case the dumb audience couldn't put it together that this guy is mean to women and should die, even though, he already did... stupid decision.

Weird Unnecessary Set Up Scenes: So apparently there was a dog in the camp somewhere, you see like one second where it's trying to bite open the cage. Ok? It's just out of the camera until the very end, who knows what it was doing the whole time, who got to it, why they wanted the dog, whatever. It pops up at the end anyways which brings me to another scene. Kate and the one Norwegian that doesn't speak English (Lars) go to a grenade cache in a fairly suspenseful scene, but then he just opens it up and stares at her and grunts ""granada"". If I were Kate I would be like ""Ok. What about the grenades? Any plan with them? Are you going to start chucking grenades at whoever turns into the next thing in these tight confined rooms? Couldn't grenades destroy most of the building, messing up the whole warm shelter situation we have going for us? Why grenades? Aren't flamethrowers doing the job already? What? Who? Why?"" Grenades serve no practical purpose for them until the very ending, he just shows it to her and might as well wink at the audience, saying ""we know this a prequel, see?"".

-The Trailer: The trailer gave away everyone who was the Thing in one way or another, and even if you didn't see the trailer the film itself makes it painfully clear who's the Thing. One of the great things about the original is that whenever someone turned out to be the Thing it was completely unexpected, they were completely off the list of red herrings and the film doesn't exactly show when they were assimilated. In the prequel however one guy leaves the group when the Thing escapes, guess what happened to him? Later we see that guy just stare at someone as THEY leave the group, guess what happens to that person! Edvard genuinely suprised me though, but that brings me to my next point.

-The Thing itself: despite it being crappy CGI effects the Thing itself acted stupidly, I guess you could say it was getting used to people so it was more prone to mistakes, but that sounds like a sloppy excuse considering this Thing likely wiped out planets in order to get all those grotesque shapes. In this prequel however when the Thing attacks people it's very loud and makes a huge commotion, like when the French chick turned into the Thing it started throwing bookcases over and roaring really loudly, also breaking the door open to chase Kate down a hallway. Can you imagine if it happened to catch her and assimilate her, both of them later explaining that to the others? ""Uhh we were kind of play fighting and one of us hit the door so hard it broke off, yeah that's it, keep looking at that broken door with your back turned as we roar into giant things and make even more commotion"". Also the Thing in Carpenter's wasn't a good brawler, it's strength was stealth, it attacked one person at a time and when it was confronted by multiple people it wasn't very effective, it tried hiding and running away. In this new one when Edvard changes he kills like 6 people under a minute, the worst addition being that lame spear tentacle that stabs a few people. Wow, really interesting death scene, *yawn* oh is it over already?

Third act: After the camp is decimated and the two attractive American's are chasing the evil sexist foreigner the film reaches what could be the dumbest scene of all time, the space ship scene. Basically it's an excuse for Kate to get stuck in narrow spaces and for loud CGI jump scares, until we get to the famous gender showdown at the end, where she blows it up similar to the ending to Carpenter's the Thing. Here's an alternate idea for that whole third act, the spaceship crashed, the alien LEFT the spaceship so it's obviously NOT working, instead of going back it makes a break for another camp and the tractor runs out of gas so it starts going on foot. The American's catch up but are low on flamethrower gas, so they have to sacrifice the gas to get them back in order to destroy the Thing once and for all. This would lead to an ambigious ending, instead of Kate going to some Russian camp after burning the stupidest Thing ever that didn't kill her when it had the chance.

But it had some good aspects too, the cinematography was beautiful, and I thought the cold climate was shown effectively. The Thing designs were still grisly and memorable, also some of the deaths were pretty nasty (like the hand-thing glued to that guys face, F THAT). Despite the predictability of who was who there was still some tension in the 2nd act between all of the characters, and they played off each other really well. And of course the ending was a perfect bridge between Carpenter's version and the prequel. Overall I found it disappointing though because it was obviously rushed out and dumbed down for mass appeal.
When the Thing came out in the 80's someone summed up it's production process perfectly, saying ""it was a movie that could only come out in the 80's"", meaning the studios were more lax about what was going on, the deadlines weren't rushed, they had time to make some really good practical effects, and so on and so forth. It was a product of it's time, similar to the first couple of Star Wars, the prequel to the Thing however is also a product of the current time, the Thing's now owned by Universal and they made it as appealing as they could, sacrificing geniune surpises, fleshed out characters, and a really solid script for a quick appealing film. If Carpenter's film released in 2011 it would probably be like this, CGI fest with a rushed script. I would however recommend this to anyone interested, especially if they haven't seen the 80's version. It's still a pretty interesting story, but if you've seen the Carpenter version and how tight that script was this one comes off as weak and disappointing.",1329091200,,8683,4.585318737926594

Almost all of them are a little over the top and they almost always say the exact same thing if you just swap whatever product or service it is they're going to try to sell us.

I'm not sure if motion picture Director's have to sell their idea in a written treatment, but I wondered aloud if Vinken Von Duchsmieldt (or whatever his name is) had to write one to direct 'The Thing'.  If so, and if someone could score me a copy, I'll pay $5 for it.

I paid $4 to watch 'The Thing' and I'm sure that whatever his vision was to get the job was hilarious.

It's not that 'The Thing' is hilarious, but when you sit for a moment in your living room chair, alone because the wife and kids are gone to visit the in-laws, and think about what you just witnessed...you wonder how such a wonderful idea could be butchered so badly.

I refuse to watch remakes of terrific movies and John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is FIVE STARS.  It's unparalleled in it's genre and still, to date, one of my five favorite movies.  When I read that this was meant to be a prequel to the 1982 film, I figured no harm-no foul.

You have your mixture of Norwegians, Swedes, Latinos, Africans, and Americans all working as scientists in Antarctica.  There are a ton of camps up there for some reason, apparently...as we know there is the Pro-American Camp not too far away and find out there might even be a Russian Camp not too far away, either.  Who cares, really.

We find out that the United Nations of scientists stumble upon the alien craft that spawns 'The Thing' and, of course, they fiddle-fart around with appendages and all hell breaks loose.  Now it's up to Casper Den Kompnenstov to make this a fun-filled-thrill ride for the motion picture thrill seeker.

What you, your neighbors and I get is a confused mess that makes little to no sense.  It's 1982 and there are futuristic helicopters flying all over the joint.  Aircrafts crash 20 miles away from camps in subzero mountainous/rugged terrain and survivors appear at the door in three hours.  One guy leaves a room and then you don't see him until the end in a random control room (oh yeah, THAT guy...I wondered what happened to him), one guy leaves and gets violently attacked and then magically appears late A-OK (did The Thing not like him?), dogs disappear, the dogs owner reappears and randomly says, ""That's no dog!"" when the dog reappears.  There are more holes in this film than in a box of Honeycomb cereal.  It's truly astonishing.

One thing that could save it some dignity is that we're currently residing in the 21st Century and we could really get some great features on The Thing.  A contemporary feel, so to speak.  Well, much like Lucas's prequels to the Star Wars Trilogy, you'll look back at Carpenter's version and realize that they just don't make 'em like they used to.  BORING, unrealistic garbage is what we get for the most part, here.  The first autopsy/examination we see offered hope, but it just turns into some sort of venus flytrap-Leviathon-upside down corpse concoction the rest of the way.  ZERO imagination, here.  I could have helped.  They had 30 years to think about it, for crying out loud.

I will say that whoever the girl is who plays the lead did a good job.  She's got nothing to work with here but she's a good actress and I was happy she didn't get killed....or did she?

Oh my GOD...The Thing really has me thinking now.  What am I going to do?

As for this movie the CGI just goes way too far and even though it may look kinda scary or gruesome, your eyes can easily tell what is real and isn't in this movie.

4850782,4,B005NYMXIU,"First,kudos to Amazon for offering this movie as a ppv download!..I have a Netflix account,and The Thing wasn't going to be available until Feb. 28. That wasn't going to do for a big fan of the originals,1951 and 1982. So for $3.99 I could watch it now,no excuses.

I didn't know until yesterday that Amazon even offered this service,pay per view online for current releases when they're available everywhere else,except for Netflix. Don't get me wrong,the Netflix service is a great deal if you have some patience for must see new releases,which I usually have,but not this time!

As for the movie,my expectations were very high or at least very hopeful,and I wasn't disappointed...For the most part...I wish they hadn't rushed things like they did at times. I prefer slower reveals,more suspense,but overall,they did a great job. The other problem throughout the whole movie was a very dark picture making it hard to see anything. This did nothing to add fear or suspense,it was more frustrating. Maybe when watching it on dvd at home the picture will be a little brighter.

This would be a great idea for the next 'Thing' or for a similar movie,there should be some thought provoking dialogue between the alien and the humans. A moment when everyone knows who is what,and there's a pause in the mayhem to find out what is motivating the alien imposter,the why,what and how behind its actions...It would have been very interesting to find out if the alien was just a homicidal maniac or since it's very intelligent there might be a method to the madness,a plan,a vision.

And even bolder idea then would be to let the alien bad guy win to see what that agenda is after reaching full fruition!..If the ""thing"" took over the world and won complete victory,how would the world change and how would the world be different...As humanoid things how would we be the same and how would we be different.

Such a movie would be extremely entertaining and thought provoking as well!..I suspect that eventually humanoid aliens would become just like we are today,only made out of different stuff,maybe better.

But I don't think movie makers have the guts to make such a movie where the aliens win,and we get to see what develops long term...Most movie makers don't have much original thought...Trust me Hollywood,let the aliens win sometimes,all the way,please.

I want to see a faithful sequel to the 1979 version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"",and see how the world and humanoids would change and remain the same,and then I want to how as humanoids we would evolve or devolve...My guess is over time we end up going full circle. After all humans are largely just the sum of their/our memories,and this alien creature not only absorbs and assimilates our bodies but also our brains and memories to not only pass for human but as the specific individual it's using as its host...

4850788,1,B005NYMXIU,"I am all for adding to a mythos but that doesn't mean it is always a good thing (no pun intended).

How can one rate this film without looking at the John Carpenter version? Since it is meant as a direct prequel, I would argue that you can't. So, from an the point of view of one of the members of the expedition (which was John Carpenter's intent)let's give an overview of that version:

An antarctic research crew encounters a being which can mimic anyone or anything it absorbs (and summarily duplicates). It turns out that this being is extraterrestrial in origin and is both cunning and pretty successful as an ambush predator, not to mention very intelligent. It is the ultimate ninja (not the video game kind) as it patiently waits, bides its time and methodically begins taking over whomever it can. It acts with intelligence and foresight by absorbing/assuming individuals as it can and only ONLY acting in direct opposition when cornered, exposed or weak. But even then it has a back-up plan. When it ambushed Bennings and was discovered part way through, it (as the Thing was also at least Palmer and Norris by this time) acted against itself to protect the greater whole. Now none of this is to say the Thing didn't make some mistakes. It did attack the dogs under the assumption that it would be able to successfully absorb all of them. The noise worked against it in that case. The point being is the Thing acted with intelligence as a thinking being would do and was under the same (or very similar) physical limitations as terrestrial creatures. Even the finale blatantly suggested that freezing was now its plan as a rescue team would likely show up eventually taking it to more civilized areas.

Now here comes The Thing (2011), the prequel the the 1982 John Carpenter version which deals with the Norwegian Camp's experiences. Did not have any problem with any of the actors. Felt Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great for her part. The film itself? Hmm, let's see, early in the film they find the block of ice containing the Thing. It then breaks out of the ice? Really? So it freezes because it can't do anything else but then breaks out of the ice because, what, it didn't really need to allow itself to freeze in the first place. I am confused at this point. As the film progresses, one of the Things is now in a helicopter being taken away from the Norwegian camp which would eventually lead to more civilized areas (**Edit: I stand corrected, the helicopter was called back to the base before the Thing attacked. I still feel the attack in the air goes against how the Thing normally acted as both patient hunter and intelligent creature). So instead of biding its time it attacks the helicopter crew and allowing itself to crash and be trapped back at the Norwegian camp? Really? I guess the whole intelligent being idea was totally scrapped. I did like the idea that it can't replicate artificial parts (i.e. fillings and knees replacements) but then it decides to ambush our Hero Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the most profoundly clumsy and noisy way possible? Really? Which of course does not succeed and puts everyone that wasn't already on edge, in total Red Alert mode. I'm sorry, the film came off the rails pretty quick in Act II. What followed was just a loud, noisy action film with plenty of monster hi-jinx and scene match-ups with the 1982 version of The Thing when they travel to the Norwegian camp.

Ultimately a failure in my opinion, due to the plot, writing or whatever mechanism completely stripped our villain (i.e. The Thing) of any true intellect and cunning. Again, while the performances were all solid it ended up being a pretty heartless outing overall and not worthy of its title. My only hope is that people will look to (re)connect with the far superior John Carpenter version. I would love to see more in this universe/sub-genre/whatever but if they are going to throw out the truly interesting and unique aspects, why bother? Judging by the reviews I can only assume the vast majority enjoy loud, CGI pseudo-gore action/sci-fi/horror films and it is a pity.",1328659200,12,4107,4.707927677329624

Other than the lead character we never got to know them and never cared if they lived or died.  In JC's version you knew who was who even with the limited time each character had.

The CGI also wasn't the greatest but the 1982 version puppets doesn't hold up well today so CGI is where we are at.  Unfortunately this movie didn't have a Lord Of The Rings type of budget to make that CGI look real.

Now . . . in 1951 we lacked the GCI tchnology to have TheThing marph shapes as in Campbell's original story.  So we had James Arness + the USAF and a love story.  Today we have the gci effects and it is possible, tho no one has had the guts to do it, to make the film an honest adaptation of the Campbell story.  While the original film had the spaceship be both a recent arrival and a flying saucer in shape [which of course reflected  the flying saucer reports of that era] at least the ship was destroyed accidentally . . . as Campbell wrote it.  BUT, the Campbell spaceship was not saucer shaped but an obvious space ship design. It's destruction was  also accidental as was the discovery of The Thing some distance away apparently having be sent on a solo reconnaisance before whatever happened to bury both that individual and ship/crew in ice.  Moreover it had been in the Arctic ice  for apparent eons AND the dicoverers and scientits who had to fight it out with The Thing had to improvise -- no flamethrowers, helicopters, assault rifles etc -- both the human/non human tests and ways to kill the morphing monster: blowtorch and a jury-rigged electrocution gadget.  [Campbell's heroes were always earth humans, of mostly anglo-saxon descent and instoppably ingenious in a pinch.]

Now that could be one helluva movie.  Too bad no one has the guts and/or brains to do it.  Go read the original Campbell story and then let your imagination truly soar!

What they had alot of was special effects, which became boring quickly. And finally, the ending, which is the beginning of Carpenter's version. Too bad. Sometimes prequels work. This one stands alone as a real muck up.

Again this version of ""The Thing"" is ""NO-THING.""",1328313600,4,852,4.697986577181208
4850809,3,B005NYMXIU,"Some spoilers ahead.

I am a fan of John Carpenter's The Thing, and I had read all the conflicting messages about whether this was a sequel, remake, prequel, re-imagining, redux, etc.  Essentially, this movie provides the backstory of what happened at the abandoned Norwegian base camp that is explored by characters during Carpenter's film.  A 0.5 to Carpenter's 1.0?  Anyway, no matter how you slice it, it is a valiant effort with passable acting and an attempt to marry the CGI of today with the practical effects of Carpenter's effort.

Unfortunately, fans are so strongly supportive of Carpenter's movie, that this movie received a lot of flack and felt unnecessary.  The strongest acting is crafted by the Norwegian cast and Joel Edgerton who balances out Winstead's heroine.  The CGI lacks the depth of the practical effects burned into our consciousness by the 80's film.  And you can't help to feel that this movie lacks SOMETHING!  It successfully leads right into Carpenter's story, even borrowing the theme from that film for the end credits.  But it misses the mark somehow.  Again, another argument for the reviews and message boards.  If this was an attempt to mine a franchise out of The Thing, it should be left dead and burning in the snow.",1328313600,,1259,4.914691943127962

This overly produced, bang-for-your-buck scare tactic movie should not have ""The Thing"" name associated with it in anyway, shape, or form (no pun intended).  It's mind numbingly predictable, and retarded.  The only reason I got lured into watching this finally was because of the name association.  I am going to act like I didn't ever see this, and keep the Norwegian story up to your own imagination, like Carpenter intended.  There was no heart in this remake prequel, whatever.  The only thing that they had going for them was the fact that they were able to show the minimal events that were showed in the original, about what happened at the Norwegian camp site.  That's it.  All the rest is predictable, mind numbing filler until we see:  The thing break out of the block of ice.. The ""split-face"" thing take shape, and be burned, and the ending sequence where the dog escapes from camp.  That's it.  God.

Throw in a female as an updated protagonist, add some CGI, and you have a new remake.  It was produced by Norwegians, so I figured that accounted for the Norwegian -heavy cast. I had no idea until the credits started running, , and they started chasing the dog, that this was a PREQUEL to the 1982 film!  It sent chills down my spine when the realization hit me!

No PASSION, no daring,no character development,way too many milling Norwegian scientists, not enough creature scenes for cryin' out loud !!! BORING, yes, boring, the unforgivable sin in a horror flick, one would think.
Everytime some bozo picked up a flamethrower, I flashed to ""Burn it, Giles!"", & the great interplay between that hard-ass McCready & that equally hard-assed Giles. And that last Thing appearance in the space ship, here's a grim, sneering all-too-human human FACE slapped on the front of it like an afterthought, sorry, folks, it was just too funny, but what a colossal waste of anyones  moviegoing time & dollars.

4850816,5,B005NYMXIU,"It's the winter of 1982 and the Norwegian team in Antarctica picks up a strange signal near their base of operations. They track down the location and the vehicle they are in crashes through the ice into a deep crevice. At the bottom is a flying saucer.

Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is hired from Columbia University to look at a secret find in the Antarctic and as a premier Paleontologist she has to see what the find is. She is shocked to find out that the Norwegians have found an extraterrestrial spacecraft and about 300 yards away is an alien body frozen in the glacier's ice. They believe it has been there for over 100,000 years. She coaches the team on how to safely remove the creature from the ice without damaging it.

Kate's words when they get back to base says it all, ""I'll never look at the stars the same again!"" The creature comes alive and Kate's mission is to now make everyone understand that they cannot let the creature escape and take over the world. Its life form is based on a super virus that replicates whatever animal it touches.

What follows is a prequel movie to John Carpenter's classic movie ""The Thing"". This movie in my opinion is every bit as good as the original. The acting is well done, the story line is tight and the special effects are every bit as good. The director and script writer keep finding clever ways to creep you out and they work!

This movie is well done and is a great prequel and I enjoyed every minute of it.

My only question and this goes for both movies, ""Why do you need flame throwers in the Antarctic?""

This is a must see movie if you like Sci-Fi and you liked the original movie!",1328227200,,1657,4.398692810457517
4850817,3,B005NYMXIU,"This isn't a bad prequel at all. Though I'm still a big fan of the John Carpenter version I will also get this one.
My biggest issue, and I think its a MASSIVE issue, is that this movie does not end in a way that syncs it with the Carpenter version. You should be able to watch this prequel first and then pop in the 1985 version as part 2. However the storyline of this 2011 movie doesn't allow the most obvious needed transition between the two. What were they thinking?",1328140800,,472,4.197802197802198
4850818,3,B005NYMXIU,"Well, I was psyched about this movie coming out -I didn't get to see it in theaters but got it on blu-ray and put it in to watch it and... well -hmmm. My love for Carpenter's film is great: it isn't perfect but the tension can be cut with a knife. The all male cast was perfect for what the film required. I was a bit disappointed they had chicks in this flick (girls are great but the tension was gone). As much as the producers and directors said they were fans of the first film, they made mistakes that should not have been made.

First, in the '82 movie, when Mac and Doc are visiting the camp, they come up steps to the bloody axe -the '11 movie has a dead end as Kate torches the little hand things on a wall where the steps would be for the '82 visit.

Next when Mac finds the ice casing the Thing was frozen in, I don't really see the roof as being demolished, though the '82 film doesn't offer a great view, admittedly.

Mac and Copper go outside and find the corpses with kerosene cans around them. The only time I remember seeing kerosene in the '11 movie was when they burned the Thing after it kills Henrick and then when it attacks the doctor trying to get to Kate. They didn't use kerosene to burn the ""two-head"" monster -Kate torched it, it jumped thru a wall, then she kept torching it.

When Mac and Copper get back to camp, the video of the Norwegian expedition shows them using thermite charges to blow up the ice around the ship or the creature -yet in the '11 movie the ship is still buried until the very end when the engines melt the ice and the Thing was supposedly cut free from the ice, still encased in a block of it.

Get the picture here? Though admirable, the producers of the '11 prequel did not pay that close attention. Unless I missed something but these are important things. The dog at the end that runs off looks nothing like the dog in the '82 version -this is a direct connection for the films. (Remember the scene in the rec room, before the Thing gets free and Lars is petting his dog?) -that is supposed to be the ""Thing"" dog at the end since the Thing killed the dog after it's escape.

Again, Carpenter's film isn't perfect but it's a masterpiece in horror and paranoia -the new film, should have had everyone on the edge of their seats with palatable tension but (except for not knowing what to expect) this movie didn't have the tension. The new film should have set the tone and taken it a step further -real adrenaline rushed paranoia.

Another flub is when Kate (barely) escapes the other chick ""Thing"" and it attacks the poor doctor -suddenly, outta nowhere Lars comes running up with the flamethrower -? How did he know to bring it? In the '82 film, Childs was told to bring the flamethrower. The '11 movie assumes too much.

I respect that they used many practical elements but some of the CGI actually looked like, well, CGI. The scene where Adam is attacked and the Thing is merging its face with his, its seemed to me they didn't finish that CGI very well, watch it a few times. I only rated it as high as I did outta respect for Carpenter's movie.

The characters, though well played, looked too clean. The grit and dirt of the '82 film was lost (admittedly there is 29 years separating the two movies) but all the characters didn't look weather beaten or even cold. The girls looked too nice, the guys too sharp and clean. Not enough facial hair, unkempt or ill trimmed. It was too slick. The Thing attacks were too ""one after the other"" -no suspense. How did half the people (including the guy on the helicopter and the other chick) become Things? In the '82 movie, you can kind of get a timeline of when most everyone got attacked -not all mind you but most.

In the end, if you're a fan of the '82 Carpenter film, stay that way -you may be disappointed in this prequel. I was. Again, I rated it three stars out of respect for what Carpenter did in 1982. He unleashed the Thing.",1328140800,,3939,4.3108108108108105

Rule of thumb: if you're going to invoke the name of a beloved classic and slap it on your film, it better be a damn good film, because comparisons to the original are inevitable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the ostensible lead here, as a paleontologist who is brought to an Antarctic research station where a spacecraft has been discovered beneath the ice, complete with an extraterrestrial survivor. When the alien promptly escapes its icy prison and begins taking the form of the various researchers, jump scares and gore ensue.

The cast is good, especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead's reluctant heroine, Joel Edgerton as the American pilot and Eric Christian Olsen's doleful lab assistant.

4850823,5,B005NYMXIU,"Last night my wife and I watched the prequel to John Carpernter's The Thing and really enjoyed it. We originally saw it in the theaters and then bought it last night on Blu-Ray.

There's been a lot of talk about Carpenter's film not being ""the original."" We are all aware of the 1951 film. However, the 1951 version has almost nothing to do with the novel with which it is supposedly based on (Who Goes There?)whereas the '82 version stays overall faithful to the book.

So, in the context of this film being a prequel to Carpenter's film and NOT the '51 film, it does indeed make Carpenter's ""the original.""

When Kurt Russell discovers the base in the '82 version, it is in shambles and deformed, burnt bodies are found. (As well as one human body) The creator's job of the new film is to paint the picture of what actally happened at that base before Kurt arrived.

One can see that they took extreme care to try and recreate the scene to be as close as it could be to the '82 version. From the room ""The Thing"" was stored in to the axe in the door to the obvious ending, everything was explained at least to my satisfaction.

Was it perfect? No. A little too much CGI? Maybe. Did they do a great job? Yes. Any normal fan of the '82 version should enjoy this as well.",1328054400,9,1270,4.297071129707113

So without telling too much here is my review.
Monster effects: love the CGI...what you wanted more in the original, this movie
  will give you a lot of good effects.
Music: When they start playing that earie Bass line, you are brought back to the
  first movie, where the music took hold off you and finally spat you out
  by the movie 's end.
  But the problem, the bass line is at the beginning and at the end, so for
  most of the film, the music they use is ok...but nothing to grab you like
  the original...  The music score could have been even better here.
Acting: Bunch of guys  and 2 females.. the Original was all guys...and everyone
  was quite good and had character...In this movie, there is not enough time
  to know all of them like the first movie..could have been more scenes to
  see what these guys are all about without slowing down the movie..
  By having a female lead instead of Kurt Russell, everytime you have her
  in a scene, all cameras are on her,,and less on the others. ..So she has
  to kinda carry the whole movie...in which it doesn't work as good as when
  Kurt Russell did it.
Scenes:  Great Antartica scene will blow you away...really feel wintery and cold.

end Note:  Like i said..its not a bad movie...could have been better in some areas
  and longer...they had the site, the people...but not the script..

March 2012 update:  Tried to view it again... and eventually shut the movie
  off and i went for the original.
  The original is a classic...good every time you watch it...
  Cant say the same for this one...it just doesn't have
  qualities to make you want to watch it again and again.!!!",1328054400,,1775,4.398753894080997

4850826,4,B005NYMXIU,"Taking the James Cameron approach to a sequel (in Cameron's case, it was ""Aliens"" to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"")to ""The Thing"" prequel, director Director Matthijs van Heijningen's prequel to Carpenter's classic film redesigns the lead in the film for a Ripley type heroine and plays with our expectations based on the first film. Interestingly, the 2011 version of ""The Thing"" seems like more of a remake of Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby's ""The Thing from Another World"" (adapted from the same novella as Carpenter's film).

What's forgotten is that the 2011 ""The Thing"" was a box office and critical flop when it first appeared in 1982 for a variety of reasons (chief among them is that it pushed the edge when it came to on screen gore and creepy looking creatures). The reputation of ""The Thing"" came about due to multiple showings on cable TV and home video so it seemed like an unlikely candidate for a prequel. Many fans suspected that the 2011 film was nothing more than an excuse to remake the 1982 classic.

Director Matthijs van Heijningen and writer Eric Heisserer make every effort to avoid repeating scenes from the first film but, instead, plays a clever variation on the scenes we KNOW from the first film. That works to the advantage of the film as the plot unfolds in a very different fashion from Carpenter's film.

The 2011 prequel is a well made film and has a number of very suspenseful moments but it also has its flaws; if you have seen Carpenter's film you know what to expect it's a matter of WHEN to expect it. Luckily the writer and director do a good job of bypassing this issue most of the time by creating scenes that compliment Carpenter's film rather than duplicate them. For example the writer and director create a Thing that is much less subtle and sneaky clearly suggesting that the creature learned from the encounter here but it also allows the creature to behave slightly differently than Carpenter's version keeping this film interesting.

Also the CGI although serviceable doesn't look quite as convincing as the physical effects from the original movie (the director originally shot the film using physical effects BUT was forced to replace them with the CGI in the film).

Casting Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the role of what amounts to Mac's role (played brilliantly by Kurt Russell in the 1982 film)turns the film on its head; the members of the Norweign team aren't accustomed to taking orders from a woman much less an American who isn't even a member of their team. She's an outsider although the writer and director miss the opportunity to milk this tension filled relationship, they do get good milage out of it by putting her into direct conflict with Dr. Halvorson.

The Blu-ray for ""The Thing"" good but keep in mind this is as dark and grainy as the 1982 film that Carpenter made. Detail is pretty solid throughout. Colors are muted although skin tones look quite nice but are a bit on the cool side (which isn't a surprise). The color scheme is (not surprisingly)very much like Carpenter's film.

Audio is robust and powerful with a beautiful sounding 5.1 lossless presentation. When havoc breaks out the audio does a nice job of supporting the film making sure we are dropped right in the middle of the action.

The special features are quite good including ""The Thing Evolves"" a solid featurette on the production of the movie and ""Fire and Ice"".

We also get a commentary track from the director and producer Eric Newman. The BD is also D-Box Motion enabled.

We also get deleted/extended scenes which hint at the different film that the director might have had in mind. It's clear that there was some post-production studio interference in the structure of the film. We also get a DVD copy of the film as well as the dreaded Ultraviolet copy as well as ""Pocket Blu Applications"" and BD Live (although I didn't access this)capability.

Although it isn't quite up to the level of Carpenter's classic film, the 2011 version of ""The Thing"" is still pretty scary and entertaining.

SYNOPSIS: (SPOILERS)Dr. Kate Lloyd (mary Elizabeth Winstead) flies out to the remote Anarctic Norweign station by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) to do an analysis of the remains of a creature pulled from the ice. Recommended by Halvorson's assistant Adam (Eric Christian Olsen), Kate finds out that the Norweign team has discovered an alien spacecraft and its former occupant. While taking tissue samples for typing Halvorson awakens the creature from its cold slumber and the group quickly discover that the Thing is unlike anything else they've ever encountered; it can ""become"" any member of the team. It's clear that the creature wants to escape so it's up to Kate and Sam (Joel Edgerton)an American pilot to protect the team and destroy the creature.

On the other hand, make it all too familiar and you'll invite comparisons to what people will inevitably think is a superior original.

That being said, this prequel, called simply The Thing, is actually a pretty good film if taken on its own merits. The director is obviously a huge fan of the John Carpenter version, and takes great pains trying to keep this film as close in tone and detail to the Carpenter film. Even the  CGI effects, while doing stuff that was never possible with the original film's mostly practical effects, looks close enough to the original's effects that the comparison isn't too jarring.

I admit I'm possibly one of the biggest fans of John Carpenter's The Thing there is -- I own the film on every format, from VHS to HDVD and Blu-ray-- and I came into the prequel with negative expectations but came away pleasantly surprised. The film is much better than most critics say it is and in fact i was thoroughly entertained throughout. It also successfully treads the thin line between being a rehash and a film that offers something extra for fans of the original.

Remember, the Carpenter version didn't do all that well either when it was released theatrically and even critically, it was often cited as an inferior version of the Howard Hawkes version. It was only in video that Carpenter's The Thing has slowly gained the acclaim that it so deserves, and I feel this is the case with this new prequel to The Thing.",1327968000,2,1652,4.589830508474576

4850832,1,B005NYMXIU,"John Carpenter's The Thing is, and will forever remain, an undisputed masterpiece in the horror genre. Now the thing to do is ask yourself what made it such a monumental film. It was an ultra suspenseful who-dunnit on par with Hitchcock for starters set in a claustrophobic research station house in Antarctica. To make matters worse an alien life form is discovered that absorbs and imitates all life forms on a cellular level in order to hide and spread. The trust factor is unbearably low and the stress level is unbearably high! The writing, directing, acting, cinematography were superior to most films since and mad props go out to Rob Bottin whose practical creature FX were both innovative and unique... and terrifying! Bottin's FX work was and remains light years ahead of its time even back in 1982. Digital FX are still trumped by what was accomplished in this film.

The first time I heard there was going to be a prequel I immediately asked, ""why?"" How in the world does some no-name first time director get a project like this to begin with and secondly making a prequel to a film that masterful is just a bad idea. Carpenter's film gave a very startling and unsettling glimpse into the aftermath of an outbreak of this... thing at the Norwegian encampment at the beginning of his film. It was ambiguous and downright disturbing and it should have been left at that. However, you know Hollywood can't resist a quick buck despite how flimsy the effort at earning it may be.

So here's the deal - I walked into this film with literally NO expectations and I got what I paid for. The director seems to have made a film if for no other reason than to explain why there was an axe in the door at the Norwegian encampment and why there was a man with his wrists and throat slit frozen in his chair. Answers that were far more satisfactory with each individual viewer providing for themselves based on what ensues in that original film. And do you know what the best part about this sequel is despite the director's attempt to provide continuity between the films? He failed to do so and it still leaves me shaking my head.

Right off the bat the film loses momentum because we already could guess what happened at the Norwegian encampment from Carpenter's film. From the start it was like watching Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader... there was really no point to it. Secondly, the acting in this film is as Hollywood and cookie cutter as it gets. The characters are one dimensional and the film races past any and all substance simply to show the monsters. Now the monsters in this film don't hold a candle to what Bottin accomplished in the original. Now what I mean by this is that the thing can be anything it needs to be to defend itself and escape when threatened or attacked. That made the moments of the original film, when you did see the creatures, so shocking and violent. The creatures in this film simply show themselves for the sake of showing themselves and aren't necessarily threatened at all when the seamless CGI morphing begins. In the originals bodies would convulse and erupt into grandiose sculptures of the macabre. Don't look for that in this film because you're not going to get it. So there's another factor of a good, suspenseful and frightening film removed.

Don't get me wrong, the first alien attack in this film was pretty cool despite that it broke the concept of the being needing to be alone and in close proximity with its host in order to digest and re-form. But that's all I can give it. This film, at best, is just another creature feature... but what could we really expect? And the film's finale was truly... painful to sit through because it's just so silly. I wasn't surprised when I saw the film, not in the least. The best thing about this film is that it made me want to go home and watch the Carpenter film which is far more satisfying!",1327881600,29,3894,4.582496413199426

This film is pretty much just back story to the '82 movie, and it's got a lot of flaws in it that simply don't align well with the '82 version.  It's literally like the writers and director decided that they wanted to show exactly how some things seen in the '82 movie occured...and some other things that were seen, they said, ""forget that, I gotta cooler idea!""  For example, the bloody axe at the Norwegian camp, they show exactly how that got there; The use of thermite to uncover the alien ship?  Nope, the ships' own engines, turned upward, to melt the ice.  It's a real WTF? moment.  It's not a bad movie, just kinda boring.  Some scenes are actually quite good.  And others made me think to myself, ""now that's just stupid"".

THE THING shows up on the american camp as a dog from the norweigen outpost, during the course of the movie we get to learn and see some facts at the norge outpost and also see the ship and ice where THE THING has escaped from,So for a long time i have always wondered for years what really happened at the norweigen outpost,THE THING 2011 using the same title is a prequel and shows and answers many questions of what happened before the creature invaded the american outpost. I have just seen a few months ago THE THING 2011 and  loved it, throughout the movie we get to see what MACREADY (kurt russell) and the doc saw when they visited norge campsite. The Thing 2011 is intriguing and truly a suspenful science fiction. Even tough most of the creature is cgi effects it still blends in well keeping up with the traditional monster of the 1982 film. The 1982 version special effects to me is superior with its practical effects but the 2011 still maintains its creature effects with a tastful style never over doing the 1982 version so we get to see two sides of the creature in the prequel, we see the monster moslty and in the 1982 it quietly lurks in the shadows and no one knows who is who. We finally get a chance to see the inside of the spaceship as well as getting a glimpse of what the thing originally looked like. THE THING 2011 is a great addition to the 1982 version and in time will be a classic and of course The 1951 HOWARD HAWKS THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD is also a masterpiece even though its the hollywood version and based loosly on campbells book,over all, all three movies are great examples of pure alien terror that rips apart humans and the battle begins is what science fiction is all about,the will to survive under difficult situations.

I can't complain about the CGI... we've all gotten so used to seeing grand vistas, battles stretching beyond the horizon and brutal violence in full-view... most films use some kind of CGI.  The Griggs-monster (in the chopper), was very cool, but the tentacles-and-toothsome-gaping-maw was getting pretty old toward the end.  I didn't care for the art direction for the inside of the flying saucer:  I know it's an alien culture and saucer is ergonomically designed to accommodate an alien creature, but the problem was the outside of the saucer doesn't resemble the inside.  The inside looked like that organically-inspired, curved walled interior of the Jupiter 2 in the ""Lost in Space"" remake.  All in all, though, I found the movie exciting.  The fight in the rec room served as the ""bomb-in-the-closet"" in Stephen King's ""The Stand"", eliminating a lot of characters in short order.  The art direction for the camp and costumes is excellent!  I like the way the director got around rehashing the primitive computer graphics of the 1982 version during the investigation of the cellular activity by going full CGI, showing the cells as viewed through a microscope.

4850841,3,B005NYMXIU,"This is copy and pased from a online newspaper site I send movie reveiws to:

A group of Norwegian scientists find a frozen space ship along with an alien that supposedly died 100,000 years ago. The scientists hire a paleontologist to help deliver the frozen alien safely back to the Norwegian base and conduct experiments on the corpse to understand what it is. This is their chance to boast to the world that they have made a huge discovery. What they don't know, is they are in for a deadly night, with help from thousands of miles away.

I entered the theater with a positive attitude, despite having a history of hating sequels and remakes. I actually had high hopes for this film. The commercial seemed to promise the audience that despite being a prequel to the John Carpeter movie, it was going back to the basics of horror movies, and was not going to fool us with over blown special effects and bad acting. However, after the end credits, my friends and I agreed that it was only an ok film.

My first problem with the movie is the title itself. Why on earth is the movie called The Thing when the John Carpenter remake shares the same title? I noticed many viewers were confused by the title, and that this movie's plot would differ from the eighties' version. Unless a person had done some research online before seeing this movie, they wouldn't get that this is a prequel. I personally would have called it, ""The Thing: The Norwegian Base."" It may not be the best title for the movie, but at least people would know it's not a remake.

My second biggest complaint is the Thing itself. In the eighties' version, the Thing is never truly seen in full form until the end of the movie. That version followed the standard set by Jaws, where the Thing is barely seen and slowly consumes its victims one by one, giving time for the viewer to wonder who the bad guy is and how the heroes are going to save themselves. In this prequel however, right off the bat, you see the Thing in its full form and its other versions as well. I dreaded the Thing, because every time it was on screen, it made the loudest screams. I wished I had a mute button. And of course, the alien is full CGI, which is not surprising, but I was hoping that they would stick to the original puppetry like the eighties' movie did.

My third and final complaint is the continuity errors in the film. You wouldn't notice them unless you watched the John Carpenter movie. But the errors are so bad they stick out like a sore thumb, if you have watched the other one. The biggest error is how they delivered the ending that is supposed to connect to the beginning of the 1980's movie. I felt the director screwed up, and at the last second0 shot the credits scene as a way to make sure the movie somehow tied to the predecessor.

On a good note however, I will admit I liked the characters in this movie because they were much smarter than most characters portrayed in slasher films today. The characters knew they were in a dangerous situation, and despite being under constant attack, they tried their best to keep calm and use their heads instead of doing dumb things that would make the situation worse. Also, despite borrowing moments from the eighties' movie, they did something new and interesting that actually was quite clever.

The movie may have its flaws and weaknesses, but I commend it for trying to go back to its roots and not follow horror-film standards of extreme gore and overused sex scenes. It's a good movie, but it would have benefited if the director or crew from the eighties' movie supervised the filming.

4850846,1,B005NYMXIU,"Is it a prequel?  Is it sequel? Is it good story telling?  The answer to all these questions is no!  All this movie is is a forgettable pile of poo.....  Spend your money on something else; don't reward Hollywood by giving them your hard earned money -- because they certainly did not work hard on this generic mess.

John Carpenter's The Thing--his 1982 Antarctic update of a 1951 B movie about an alien organism on a rampage at a remote Arctic outpost--was one of the best horror movies ever made. It was a seamless work of dread-inducing art that boasted a brooding score by Ennio Morricone, dazzlingly gruesome special makeup-FX by Rob Bottin, and star Kurt Russell, who was still basking in the year-old glow of his spot-on portrayal of antihero Snake Plissken in Carpenter's equally awesome Escape From New York.

In short, The Thing was the type of rare Hollywood release that made you proud to be a horror freak.

Unlike this lousy Thing.

A prequel to Carpenter's cult classic by Dutch commercial director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.--don't worry, there's no point memorizing the spelling--it opens with a trio of Norwegian researchers in the Antarctic discovering a spaceship buried in the ice, the frozen corpse of an alien being nearby. Realizing the colossal import of their find, they haul the body back to the outpost in a huge ice cube and use a drill to awkwardly extract a tissue sample. Forgetting that ice melts, they then go party. While they're dancing the Norwegian jig, their prize springs to life, resembling a gooey, spider-crab thingie with flailing octopus arms. After 100,000 years of slumber, it's understandably cranky.

The alien is able to replicate human DNA and mimic bodies, so the rest of the film sees it repeatedly bursting from the flesh of folks, making screechy noises while morphing into variations of the gooey spider-crab thingie and getting toasted with flamethrowers, which causes more screeching.

And that's basically it. Since Heijningen already had dibs on The Thing's hallowed name, he didn't even bother trying to conjure any of its slow-burning suspense or claustrophobic vibe, instead just blowing his creative wad on gross-out CGI effects, like the one where a vagina with teeth attacks.

Of course an American audience wouldn't be trusted to maintain interest in a Norwegian-camp prequel composed entirely of Norwegians speaking subtitled Norwegian. So we have four Americans, an Englishman, a French woman, and a bunch of indistinct Norwegians, most of whom obligingly speak fluent English. One of the Americans is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a paleonthologist recruited to have a look at the Thing discovered buried in the ice. Winstead isn't a bad actress (she was a delight in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World), and at 26 she could plausibly be a college graduate and practicing scientist herself, but the problem is she doesn't look it. Like many another actress these days, she looks far younger than her years. She doesn't get to do much science-y stuff anyway, though she does figure out that the Thing can't replicate inorganic material, so anyone without fillings in his teeth is suspect. (I'm guessing she means it can't imitate anything bioinorganic, but the producers may have feared such a word would confuse the same stupes who were assumed to need Americans in a Norwegian story.) So we get several scenes with characters yelling at each other to open their mouths.

Look at the 1982 Thing again and you see a perfect thunderstorm of paranoia and suspense, brewed up by the clash of the cold front of director John Carpenter's cool-cucumber style (the camera almost never moves, and it stares objectively at the characters much as a Thing would) and the warm front of Rob Bottin's excitable-boy, sugar-fueled metamorphosis sequences, where chaos reigns. Director Matthijs van Heijningen, a fan of the Carpenter film, gets the externals but can't duplicate the authentic chill and isolation of the original. (In some scenes, too, the steam wafting out of characters' mouths in the cold air seems real, while in others it seems digitally pasted in. It's distracting.) He isn't free to bring anything of his own, either; he's got prequel-cuffs around his wrists, locked into the look of the '82 film, and its denouement, too. We know this film has to end with a Norwegian attempting to kill the Thing before it reaches another camp, and we assume everyone else will die.

The only THING here is the pile of poo left behind by Matthijs van Heijningen.",1324598400,11,4514,4.986702127659575
4850847,3,B005NYMXIU,"While the movie itself is enjoyable, it suffers from a few problems.

Continuity: The fact that the ship is not unearthed and that Kate and the snowcats exist so close to the ship is a major continuity problem. They have also retconned the character ""Jans Bolon"" into ""Lars"". However, most of the rest of the movie does a nice job of setting up the continuity for Carpenter's The Thing. They worked in the key aspects of Carpenter's movie into the credits. Including Lars chasing Jed in the copter, which leads directly into Carpenter's film.

CGI: This movie suffers some serious problems with CGI monsters. They look too cartoony to really be taken seriously. They were, in fact, used to replace practical effects that would have worked a lot better.

Characters: Kate is a very weak hero. Her response to finding the bathroom painted with blood? Pull the other woman aside and casually mention it to her, but not tell anyone else. And her idea for a test? Check people's fillings, because it's unthinkable that someone could have good oral hygiene. They did, however do a rather good job with Lars, who takes on a roll more like MacReady. He wants nothing more than to exterminate the Things.",1324252800,2,1195,4.763285024154589
4850848,2,B005NYMXIU,"I'm going to immediately get this out of the way and make it clear that Matthijs van Heijningen has a preposterously difficult name to type, let alone pronounce, and will hereafter refer to him simply as ""the director"". That aside, his name may very well be the most intriguing element of an otherwise pedestrian prequel to John Carpenter's masterful '82 horror film. And yet, quite ironically, Carpenter's work itself truly does its successor no favors in allowing a unique be newly developed.

The end result is something that is bound by too many predeterminations and, therefore, a disappointing ability to tap into ambition. Look, it's a prequel, through and through. Not that the marketing team necessarily cared for that to slip but, as a prequel, it inaverdently does the one thing any director can admit to fearing: Limiting one's creativity. Sloppy detours intermittently show themselves throughout the film, things that would perplex a viewer without a knowledge of where the movie's foundations lie. Largely pointless questions are clumsily answered that, even for a diehard fan of the original such as myself, were hardly burning to be answered in the first place.

 Horror thrives on these uncertainties, and to seek closure for any film pertaining to the genre is almost contradictory to the essence. With that said, was I not eagerly anticipating this film as a proponent of Carpenter's original? Of course I was. As a work of cinema, The Thing is blessed with key factors in its setting and premise that trigger immediate intrigue with the audience. The ""thing"" itself is a masterclass in monster making, igniting both spectrums of our fear and paranoia by freely transitioning between the unknown and the absolutely vile. Terror can be at its best when it's right before our eyes and, yet, somehow invisible.

Carpenter took these themes and used it to conduct the closed experiment that took place within the confines of the arctic research facility in which the original took place, drawing a bead on the dozen or so men who slowly turned against each other until fragile authorities were built. It's the same story here with Kate, played by the ever lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as she struggles to retain order among the norweigan founders of the thing. Despite being only 5 minutes shorter than the original, the prequel somehow feels infinitely more anxious and frantic as pacts are made and broken in about as much time as it would take to get up and grab a soda refill. The remarkable tension that grew to a fever pitch in Carpenter's work is a fleeting visitor here. When it's present, it works just as well, but the intervals in which it's not have nothing to offer us.

Again, there's a persistent lack of vision that handicaps the director's half-hearted attempts to bring new things to the table. The effort's glaringly present, nonetheless, and one particular scene that shares no ties to the predecessor is a nail biter as Kate desperately attempts to discern between those who are infected and those who are not. And, to be ""infected"", is to witness the film's (predictably) strongest asset, and you can almost hear the director's sighs of relief when any scene involving the thing's many incarnations make themselves known; at last, an opportunity to flex the imagination.

Lacking the shocking nature of the original, who's practical special effects were critically lauded for being remarkably gory and absurd, those seen her still retain a gleeful creativity that put most other monsters to shame in this era. Bones and flesh distort and people are assaulted in shamelessly gruesome ways. It's the one thing in the film that achieves parity in greatness between itself and its superior predecessor, with actor Ulrich Thomsen's variation (yeah, he dies - people die in horror movies) almost singlehandedly redeeming an otherwise stupendously dull third act. Almost. Indeed, things do quickly fall apart when the expendable bodies start thinning out.

It's a testament to Carpenter's prowess in methodical, efficient filmmaking that the original's rising action towards its grim climax never lost any of its suspensful drive. For Heijninenblahblah, he's an unfortunate slave to whatever the original film alluded to, all the way to the rolling credits.",1324166400,10,4290,5.093883357041252
4850849,3,B005NYMXIU,"As a fan of all ""Things"" I find this prequel to the 1982 version generally of the same caliber if not quite its equal.  In fact, I think they could make a compelling double feature.  It is in fact 1982 and a Norwegian group of scientists in Antarctica discover an anomaly located deep below the ice.  An American helicopter crew shuttle the lead scientist (Ulrich Thomsen) who was summoned from Norway to check out what's what.  Along for the ride to help out is Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) an expert on extracting animal carcasses.  They believe they have found an alien pilot frozen in the ice outside a space vehicle that crashed a hundred thousand years earlier.

Winstead is an interesting choice to play what becomes the heroine of the story.  She is shy, attractive but plain and somewhat dorky.  Here she is with a group of a dozen or so Norwegian men and one woman.  Remind you of anyone?  Try Sigourney Weaver of the ""Alien"" franchise.  After ""The Thing"" escapes its now melting block of ice, it is Kate who discovers that it has the ability to replicate human cells and take over their bodies.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers were anxious to show off the creature in various stages of being, much too early in the movie.  Most great horror films hold back on showing the creature in order to build more suspense and anticipation.  Still, there are plenty of scenes to jump start the heart if that's what you're after.

""The Thing"" really doesn't give us anything we haven't already learned from the '82 version and to a lesser extent the 1951 original.  The special effects are a modest boost based on current technology.  Most interesting is the homage paid to those earlier films, especially John Carpenter's.  There are brief interludes of Carpenter's quick musical drumbeats and the ending sequence leads perfectly to the opening of Carpenter's terrific film.

4850853,3,B005NYMXIU,"The reviews were very interesting and there are some good points.
I'll start by saying I was only 12 when I saw ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" in the theater. Obviously it made a huge impression (through slightly closed fingers). I was at that point already a HUGE horror/sci-fi movie fan and even at 12 LOVED the original 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". I still love the old B/W movies and it's too bad more people don't appreciate that. With that said movies need to advance...Lord of the Rings, Jurrasic Park...great CGI.

Now if you are a true Fan of JC's version of ""The Thing"", you will know two main thngs:
1.) This is a pretty faithful version of the short story ALL of them are based on, John W. Campbell, Jr. ""Who Goes There?"" The original 1951 (although awesome) was not. Keep in mind, JC did a wonderful job giving a nod to the 1951 movie. Not to mention featuring it as the movie the kids are watching in ""Halloween"".
2.) You will have seen the extensive behind the scenes featrues on the Collector's Version DVD and know it was like the stars aligned and the circumstances worked very well to create an almost once in a lifetime movie. Now with that said, the cast, acting, direction, mood of the movie, etc was still executed at a truly phenominal level.

I am 41 now and was interested to hear about the prequel. That is the intension of this movie. Although as many pointed out, there are a great number of parallel comparisons to how the characters are and how the storyline is. I was always interested to see what SPECIFICALLY happened at the Norweigan camp and the general backstory. Was it ""necessary"" - no. But it's still fun to see. So here is a quick rundown of why I think this movie is a little better than OK.

Positive
1.) The detail to reverse engineer from JC's The Thing is pretty impressive and is fun to match up. If nothing else it is worth seeing for this.
2.) It provides a fun story and the acting is good. I did feel the tension at times.
3.) I never expected this to be better than either the 1951 or 1982 versions so my expectations were low.

Negative
1.) They should have used more tension and carefully selected when and how to show ""The Thing"". Things (no pun inteneded) did come together pretty quick so I did feel they rushed the story more than they should have. It is basically a quick add on to tell a little more on a great story.
2.) It's too bad they did overdo it at times on CGI. This is a case where a mix could have gone a long way. There IS a mix with physical FX and some of the scenes (two-head) really needed CGI.
3.) I wanted to see ""The Thing"" in a few more original, case-by-case forms, but they kinda stuck with a general ""buggy/mouthy"" idea.

It's still kinda fun. Especially the ""credit's scenes"". I have to say I was a little giggy when I saw that part.

Now given the general story line, I suppose ""The Thing"" would look and act differently the first shot out of the ice compared to having already battled a group of humans and how it learned to be more careful. I have watched the DVD (saw it in the theater on opening day), and in listening to the featrues and watching it a few times with ""fresh eyes"" I do like it better as, I suppose, I am a bit more forgiving. I still think the general idea was ""make alien go fast""! They did really want to pay homage to JC's classic (in watching the features) so kudos to them.

The Thing From Another World is a genuine classic.
John Carpenter's The Thing is a masterpiece.
The Thing 2011 is fun and they do pay their respect in their own way. They just didn't (or ""couldn't"")go ALL the way.

If nothing else, the newest version will definetly make people want to watch the John Carpenter version (hopefully) and if they haven't seen it, they're in for a real treat.

I suppose that's all you need to know.",1323648000,299,3820,4.3314685314685315
4850854,4,B005NYMXIU,"1982 was a bad year for John Carpenter. His movie, a remake of an already classic sci-fi movie ""The thing from another world (1951)"" got trounced at the box office by another Universal studio's sci-fi alien. In years to come, The Thing would become one of the most reveared sci-fi horror films ever. it took almost 30 years for someone to grow some, and give the Thing another go... A remake-prequel. And it totally WORKS!
Let me say this right of the bat. The Thing(2011) is not a remake per-say. It's definatly a prequel. Consider the producers choosing not to call it anything other than ""The Thing"". Reason: The Thing (2011) and The Thing (1982) are one film.
Evidence:
The sets are so meticulosly replicated from the 1982 production that it's scary. Even down to the iconic scene
In the first film, when Mcready is walking through the Norwegian base, all burnt out and destroyed, he comes across an axe in a wall. This is the axe that Joel Edgertons character uses to dispatch one of the hands crwaling along the wall before Mary's character burns it. She tells Joel to leave it there, to be found by Kurt in 1982.
The room that the block of ice was kept is also replicated perfectly, right down to the hole in the roof caused by the Thing as it bursts out of the ice in 2011. Kurt sees bright light beaming down onto the block of ice in 1982 that was only just brought back to the ice station only 24 hours before, through the gaping hole the roof, explaining the reason why the hole exists in the first place.
The grenades shown to Mary by Lars, the Norwegian who speaks not english, all plays out in the 1982 film.
The remains of a Thing discovered in 1982 by Kurt and later brought back to the U.S. station and examined revealing the famous Rob Bottin creature with the two merged heads is featured in 2011, showing who was the poor unfortunate who ended up being said creature.

4850855,5,B005NYMXIU,"This is how remakes are supposed to be done!  It sticks VERY closely to the original, adds substantial input without straying too far outside the original concept's box, refreshes the FX and filming for a modern audience, and throws in a final loop to make it all worthwhile.  Technically, the film is not a remake; it's a prequel, but there is enough content that nearly the entire film feels like an homage.  Very pleasing to someone wanting things to be similar to the original.  And keeping the title the same adds some John Carpenter shape-shifting mystique to the entire film.  Bravo!

For those unaware of the original, the plot is simple but insidious: An alien life-form has been found in the remote wintery wilderness of an Antarctica research site cut off from the rest of the world.  The human inhabitants must kill the alien before it reaches the rest of humanity.  The problem, the creature thrives in extreme colds, and can mimic any lifeform's appearance to perfection.

It's clear going in that none of the stars of the show have any chance of exuding the gravitas a cast of Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Keith David, and Donald Moffat, the 2011 version does a very fine, professional job of conveying the fear and paranoia of their situation.  I particularly enjoyed Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's performance.  Where the cast lacks, however, is their inability to carry, in relation to the original, the intensity.  Making up for that minor void is a substantial upgrade in action (read: more flamethrowers).  John Carpenter's version: Suspense.  2011 version: Action/Suspense.

Where this film scores the most is the story.  A plausible connection to the first film justifies the ample screen time the Thing receives, as well as some truly gruesome assimilations with the unfortunate cast-members.  The assimilations are explained with a bit of pseudo-science, but the exponential cell-to-cell siege is certainly an upgrade to the John Carpenter's version.  As with the first film's ""blood test"" reveal, the screen-writers for this film were able to insert an equally ingenious method of determining just which people were actually human.  And for those who don't realize this is a prequel, the end of this film flows so absolutely brilliantly into the original that I wanted the film to keep rolling for another 2 hours.  In true Carpenter fashion, the ending of this film is both ambiguous and fulfilling; it's not a finale in which the viewer wishes for much more.

Overall, brilliant remake.  Now that Hollywood finally got one right they can quit trying to ruin the best movies of my child-hood (Looking at you, Will Smith's son and Adam Sandler).",1323302400,6,2684,5.038548752834467

4850860,3,B005NYMXIU,"This is a solid movie worth at least one viewing. The Thing reminds me of the mindless action movies you see during the summer, you go in with the expectations that there will be flaws, but as long as things blow up your happy. The character development is almost nonexistent and the people seem more like alien fodder than one's you should care about. Which is to bad because there are some characters you want to get to know more about, something you like that makes them standout and you root for them. But the movie just speeds right along and before you know it it's over. The nice thing is there are some fun moments and good eye candy effects to keep a person entertained. I will say that a few of the CGI shots are weak, but overall the effects are a good mix of practical and computer. This movie is best watched with friends and popcorn.

I'm looking forward to listening to the commentaries, I have watched some interviews with the director and he is very articulate. I'm sure he will reveal some goodies about filming, much like Kurt and John did. Also the deleted scenes are supposed to be worthwhile, especially the one with the character Colin in it.

Cheers

ps This is a three star movie as far as overall quality compared to all movie genres. However, when it comes to sci-fi horror I give it a 4 star. Despite its flaws this movie is better than most in this category.",1322956800,,1387,4.41015625
4850861,3,B005NYMXIU,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan off the thing. I've been in love with it since I first accidentally rented at the age of 8. It's one of those movies that never gets tiring.

When I first heard about this prequel I was taken aback. Prequel? Why?
Norwegian Camp?
Wasn't it obvious what happened there? Exactly what happened to the Americans, except they lost. Suffice it to say I didn't see the need for one. But I kept my hopes up. I was actually going to see The Thing on the big screen.

Well...a Thing, anyways.

Then I heard news after news of bad things.
Newbie director?
Americans?
A chick?

But I was still resolved to hold judgment and not give into my inner hatred for these things.
And it payed off.

It was the Aliens to Carpenter's Alien. I mean that in the best way.

The movie was surprisingly good....almost above that even.
The direction was the weakest part off the bat, but even that isn't saying much. I see a bright future for MVH, even if he did cut his teeth on this prequel....(bastard)
The acting was good as well, they may not have felt like the fleshed out characters of Carpenter's, but they all felt like people. Especially Peder, Lars, and Colin.
The leads were good. They got the job done. I feel foolish for having doubted their ability.

The story was great. It was fun to go in and see how it all went to hell. Any fan, not a retentive one perhaps, would enjoy it. Hell, I think a non-fan would have a ball.
The effects, cgi this time around, were good as well. Except for two minor and horrifyingly bad instances, but they were brief enough for me not to care.

As a prequel it works phenomenally well. MVH wasn't lying about being a fanboy I'll tell you that. Except for one minor error it melds fantastically well into the Carpenter film. The ending will leave you in chills. I made sure people stayed at my viewing.

God was i disappionted when finally got to see it on opening night. It was the biggest piece of crap i have ever seen. There was no tension or atmosphere, the actors you didn't care if they died or not and the worst thing was the creature effects were nearly all CGI and most of the creatures looked very similar, not one good really creative creature in the whole film infact some of them just looked ridiculous especially the arm and hands running around. A serious missed oportunity and to be honest i can't see why these other reviewers liked the film all i can think is that they are all younger people who have grown up with crappy CGI effects and no idea's, as far as i can see anyone who is a true fan of the original film will absolutly hate this piece of crap.",1322956800,23,1039,4.148514851485149

Fortunately, the effects are solid, and the atmosphere of ""Who can I trust, who's infected?"" is still very prevalent. Although the creature looks less of a random deformation, and more like the necromorphs from Dead Space, they still cause panic and fear effectively. This movie is, however, nearly an exact replica of the first one, which caused critics to latch on to the movie like piranhas. That isn't a bad thing, though, as the John Carpenter version was a masterpiece. It is an updated version of John Carpenter's, and is still an excellent movie.",1322956800,13,796,4.817518248175182

As it turns out, it is just another alien spacecraft and there is a frozen alien in the ice. Oh yes, there is also the proverbial storm on the way. The movie reminded me a bit of ""Alien Hunter"" which in turn reminded me of an earlier version of ""The Thing.""

The alien appears early in the movie and quickly gets filled with lead. If you have seen any of these films you know the rest of the story.

The ""scientific"" aspect was better than the previous films. I still didn't buy them performing the world's first alien autopsy and no one films it. The cells as viewed under a microscope was very primitive special effects, apparently they had blown their $8 million budget when it came time to create that scene and resorted to drawing pictures on cards and flipping them real fast. The rest of the special ""Re-animator"" type effects were fairly decent. Good one to see.

4850865,5,B005NYMXIU,"I was taken kicking and screaming to the 2011 remake of the 1982 classic that I stumbled upon while being dragged to a mall by the wife years upon years ago. I hadnt heard or seen anything about the Carpenter film until I walked by the theater and saw the poster....with Mr. Carpenters name....and Russels..that intrigued me enough and I paid for admission for my then 6 year old son and I. We were both amazed and made another venture to again watch it on the big screen......got first a Betamax copy then a VHS copy then a DVD copy....fans doesnt quite describe us. On the big screen and small it was probably the most memorable movie for us during that entire decade...but most of that decade was spent watching very early Van Damme and Segal testosterone oozing films...anything with high body counts and cordite haze.
News of the ""prequel"" were heard and the grown son again accompanied me to the screening. The small town Wisconsin theater screwed up the final reel.....so I am literally being forced into purchasing the blu ray/DVD/Ulta-Violet (whatever the hell that is) copy on pre-order....I hope it is as the director wished it to be shown. I feared an ""uber-chick"" PC slant to this ""prequel"" and was happy to see that not being the case. Whenever the discs arrive I will be seeing the full movie for the first time.....the good news is that I now have a television the size of an efficiency apartment.
The majority of the movie seemed to be done very well...but the theater ruined the ending (ever tried asking for a refund? Doesnt work). So, I am going to put in my preorder so that I can finally watch all of the remake of Mr Carpenters work by a Director whose name immediately eludes one.

We now look back on it however as one of the absolute classic alien horror films.

The 1982 version has gone on to gain a cult following. So the 2011 remake had some pretty big shoes to fill and this is visible in it's reception. Lots of cult fans of the 1982 version call the original `a masterpiece' and moan how the 2011 version can't compare. This is not fair and not true. The quality of the two isn't even that far apart. I liked the hand-shot (unsteady) scenes, the Norwegian language (although Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) speaks Danish), the beautiful arctic scenery and the perfect lineup with the original at the end. If you are young and have never seen the original than this movie will do for you about the same as the original did to me as a kid. I at least thoroughly enjoyed the 2011 version and not many horror movies these days do even that. Most of all I liked the `who is who/what' paranoia all over again.

No film before or since has scared me as much as that film (granted I was 13 when I saw it). When I heard of a film at first remaking, and then covering the events prior to this film, I was to put it mildly very skeptical to outright hostile about this film. My view was that it was a stupid idea since you know what happens if they stay true to the original film. Then slowly but surely I had heard things (pun intended) about the film. I liked the cast and not just for Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I finally decided to go and see it and I was not dissapointed. The film faithfully stays true to the era (no PCs or cell phones) and to the film(it ends as the JC film begins with a helicopter chasing a Thing dog). What happens in-between was a treat to watch. The Thing really lends itself to CGI making the creatures far more lethal then their animatronic versions in 1982. The acting is first rate as is the science of discovering who is or isn't the Thing. The tension and suspicion of the first film is with you until the final reel and they do leave the camp in the same condition so Kurt Russell can find it in 1982. The fun is how they get there and what happens to everyone. If you are a fan of JC's The Thing this is a great supplemental film that adds it's own stamp to the story while setting you up for the first film.",1321833600,3,1451,4.076923076923077

Well done, of its kind, it differs from most other flicks of this sort in that the polar temperatures mean everyone stays pretty well bundled up, so we never get the usual ""vulnerability"" scene of Our Heroine in her Haynes. Also, we never get clear explanation of why this peaceful little science outpost comes so well supplied with the military goodies used against The Thing. I'm not complaining, though.

4850876,3,B005NYMXIU,"It's hard to criticize a movie like The Thing - the 2011 film by first-time director Matthijs van Heijningen - as it is in fact a good movie and very well done. And had John Carpenter never made his 1982 version of The Thing (which itself was a remake of the 1951 scifi/horror classic The Thing From Another World), then this would have been a great movie. But Carpenter did make his film and therein lies the problem.

The problem is that, while this new film is written as a prequel to the 1982 film (and why couldn't they have come up with some slightly different name, btw?) and slavishly dedicates itself to that purpose, it does not for the most part add anything to the story. Certainly not enough to warrant an entire film being made. If you've seen the earlier film, then nothing in this prequel comes as a surprise. And if somehow you never saw the earlier film, then there's no real point to seeing it after the prequel as nothing in it will come as a surprise either. The bottom line is, this was a completely unnecessary film. The basic plot and events are exactly the same, just occurring a few days earlier in a Norwegian Antarctic base instead of an American Antarctic base. Which you would already know if you've seen the first film. Both the Carpenter film and this film are good movies and both are very well done - but we only need one of them.

The plot, of course, is set in 1982, the year of the original film. At a research base in Antarctica, a team of Norwegian scientists, headed by Dr. Sander Halversen (Ulrich Thomsen), make an astounding discovery, buried deep beneath the glacial ice. Or two discoveries, actually. The first is an extraterrestrial spacecraft that apparently crashed on Earth over a hundred thousand years ago. And the second a body of what may have been one of the aliens from the ship, completely encased in - and preserved by - the ice. Determined to keep the discovery a secret but needing special expertise to research the body, Halversen recruits an American paleontologist, Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to join the project. The alien, whose outlines are just vaguely discernable through the surrounding ice, is transported back to the base where the scientists begin their research by drilling a hole in the ice to secure a small tissue sample. This decision has unfortunate consequences as shortly afterwards, while most of the scientists are celebrating their discovery, the creature bursts out of its icy confinement, incredibly somehow alive in spite of having been frozen for the last hundred thousand years. Alive, and as the scientists quickly discover, more dangerous than any of them could ever have imagined. The `thing' as they call it, not only attacks everything it encounters, its cells have the ability to mimic living tissue: it can become whatever it kills or infects. And suddenly the scientists are trapped in a paranoid nightmare: which of them are still human, and which of them have been replaced by the thing? Which is pretty much the dilemma of the first film, and so nothing that happens will surprise anyone who's seen the original.

To its credit, The Thing does deliver the goods where the creature is concerned. The skin-crawling creepiness of its various manifestations and forms and the sheer grisliness of its attacks are on a par with what Carpenter's original provided in spades. And Winstead's Lloyd does come up with a clever way of distinguishing who's human and who's one of the things that is completely different from the blood test that was used in the original film. But only fans of the first film will be able to appreciate what the director and writer managed to accomplish in making this a true prequel. When I say that this version of The Thing was slavishly devoted to making itself a prequel, I mean it. Enormous care was taken both in the writing of the script and in the filming of the shots to reproduce in exacting detail the images of what the American team found when they went to the Norwegian base in the early part of the original. And the very end of the film - you'll have to sit through the ending credits to catch it - dovetails perfectly with the beginning scene of Carpenter's film.

Without giving away any spoilers, I will note that the new film's makers did allow themselves a possible basis for another sequel (technically the Carpenter film counts as a sequel now, at least in terms of story) to this film. Whether or not it's made will probably depend on how well The Thing does at the box office.

One final note - I would have to rate the Carpenter film as better than this one in two areas. The Carpenter film had a better musical score, done by the immortal Ennio Morricone. The new score by Marco Beltrami is not bad, but Morricone's bass-thrumming score lent an edgier tenseness to the earlier film. The Carpenter film also had better dialogue, and more humor, as exemplified in the classic line ""I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is."" On the other hand, van Heijningen's film does have one very funny dirty joke, related in Norwegian with English subtitles, that's so obscene I can't relate it here but is pretty damned funny nonetheless.

And one final question - why is it that Antarctic research stations in these movies all seem to be abundantly supplied with flame-throwers? It's not the sort of thing you'd thing would be standard equipment for that environment, unless the alien threat in Antarctica is a lot greater than the new media would have us believe.

If you've already seen Carpenter's The Thing, then I can recommend this film as a kind of filler-in for people who want to know exactly what happened in the events prior to the Carpenter film and don't expect much else. But if by chance you haven't seen the Carpenter film, then I would highly recommend you see at least at least one of these two films; it's just that there's no pressing need to see them both.

But all that said, both films will still scare the living daylights out of you and probably show up in your nightmares.",1321747200,7,6081,4.660764212488351
4850877,4,B005NYMXIU,"When I first heard that they were coming out with another The Thing, I got incredibly upset because I thought it was just another remake. Well, it turned out it is a prequel to a remake, the 1982 version. I still was skeptical about a prequel of a movie from almost 30 years ago. Surprisingly I was blow away by the little things that were thrown into the 2011 prequel which linked to the 1982 version. Little things like the ax in the wall that Kurt Russell sees when he first visits the Norwegian base, the burnt Thing outside the base as well as so many other little similarities which perfectly link the two movies. It was very well done and completely took me off guard as I expected this to be a quick slasher remake just to make cash for Universal.

They did a great job of respecting the original work and perfectly blending the end of this film into the beginning of the 1982 version of The Thing with Kurt Russell. Make sure you stay for the credits as little clips connect to the start of the 1982 version.

Yes, The Thing alien was pretty much all CGI, however they did a really good job of it and some things actually surprised me how well they did it and how far they took it. The cast and acting was perfect and felt right throughout the film. Yes, it lacked some character development, however they used fear and the casts' reactions as a solid character introduction.

Nothing will ever top the 1982 version of The Thing, however this 2011 version of The Thing is a perfect Prequel to that and I could not have asked for a better horror flick. One recommendation I have is that if you see the 2011 The Thing in theaters or watch it at home on Blu, make sure to clear your schedule and watch the 2011 version and the 1982 version back to back. You will be quite surprised by the similarities and the amazing level of detail to each and every scene. The makers of the 2011 The Thing must be huge fans of the 1982 version as they made a perfect prequel to such an amazing film.

4850878,5,B005NYMXIU,"Thats one of the early lines in the film from Kate, it could also be asked about making a prequel to the much loved '82 classic. Just like in the movie, my answer is ""yes I do"". Making a film this many years after a classic and trying to make the story before that movie is challenging.  When watching The Thing from '82 you had to wonder about the Norwegians and the back story, thats why this film is interesting. I went into the film with an open mind. It surprised me in the amount of detail. They really tried to match this up with the prior film as best they could. With the age gap between the films, I think they did a great job.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate a paleontologist, brought to Antartica to help in bringing a frozen ""thing"" out of the ice. She starts out observing and asking questions while Dr. Halvorson conducts his analysis of the specimen. As the story unfolds however, its Kate that uses her head and leads the group. The question throughout the film is- who is human? Nobody is who they seem all the way til the end. And some people you think aren't human, turn out to be only to be different later. The effects and cgi are executed very well here. The examination of a consumed human within a thing is creepy. They even have to cut through a casing around the human- sick stuff. The star of the movie is definately Winstead, although the cast is collectively good. The casting was very good for a film that mixes characters from different countries. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the group gathers for a test to see who is human. This is where Winstead is at her best. Great work here. And the best weapon against these things is THE FLAMETHROWER! Great action throughout the movie- you won't be disappointed. Theres even some time spent in the craft these visitors came to Antartica in. And you'll get that feeling of isolation and fear that the '82 movie was effective at. Not to mention not everyone speaks English which adds another dimension. What could be worse than being in the freezing cold, thousands of miles from civilization and not knowing if the person next to you is human? The movie doesn't end with the credits. Most the people at the theater left at this time. But there is a bridging of this film straight into the '82 film. The dog being chased by the helicopter is here. ""Thats no dog!""

Some production notes that I thought were interesting. There was a million screen captures of the '82 film on a lap top. That was used to create as close as possible, the Norwegian camp. The film used practical effects as much as possible over CGI. The movie was shot in Toronto. The lead character of Kate was inspired by the Aliens films, which you feel a little watching the film. John Carpenter wanted to make an appearance in the film, but this didn't happen because of scheduling.

4850880,3,B005NYMXIU,"In this day and age of remakes, prequels and reboots, and other endless franchise padding, it only seemed inevitable that John Carpenter's The Thing, which forever became known as a cult classic after it tanked hardcore in cinemas, would get the honour. Or is it a dishonour? That certainly seems inevitable, as the reaction to the fact it is getting a prequel of sorts got a mixed reception when announced some time ago.

A fan of the original film, I tend to take a disliking to prequels in general. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I find prequels tend to ruin what you liked about a piece of work in the first place. Remember Lucas' three-part turd he dropped on us some time ago? Yeah. Let's not go there. But, if done right, a prequel can be entertaining. This year, two prequels got released that entertained me lots; X-Men First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And then, this got released.

The film is essentially a prequel, or so it says, to the 1982 remake of the '55 film. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World) is a brilliant, young and beautiful scientist, studying in Antartcica. The Norewigans have discovered a mysteriously unknown apparatus in the ice, and invite Mary and her team to investigate. They stumble upon a gigantic ice block with a seemingly mysterious creature inside it. Thiking they have discovered something incredible, they transport it back to base, and celebrate.

However, on the night of the celebration they discover the ice is melting faster than usual, and in a rather effective jump scare, the thing escapes. Now their doom has been sealed, and death, chaos and destruction is about to happen. The terror is heightened when they realize that there is no true specimen. It has a way of letting its cells get into the people and imitating them, thus turning into the thing itself.

Now, I will say that there's a lot to love about this movie, but unfortunately there's a lot to hate about it too, and it gets to the point where you're not sure if you should think it's a good movie or a bad movie.

However, I could very well be blowing steam up this film's ass, but I would consider it to not be a bad movie at all. First off, the movie is well shot, and has a nice atmosphere, though it doesn't have a scratch on the first movie in terms of the two. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic, and manages to make her character in the film totally believable due to her performance. The score is excellent too, it mixes in a higher budget film sound with the creepiness of Morricone's score.

In addition, the special effects are nice. Of course nothing can touch the original's practical effects that make me cringe and gag lots yet still scare the hell out of me all these years later, but the digital special effects manage to impress. Problem is, that the magic of the effects are gone in this film, I couldn't be grossed out by it at all. Instead it's just... Digital.

However, there is a fair deal to hate about this film too, like I mentioned. For one, the most obvious being that this just seems too much the same as the first. There's even the obligatory ""we must have a test of some sort to see who's real"" scene that was done incredibly much better in the 1982 film. And the only reassurance that it's a prequel is the scene during the credits at the end, which, while the best part of the movie, all so simultaneously feels like an excuse for the film to say ""just in case you forgot, I'm a prequel!"". It just feels... there.

Another thing about the film is that it almost completely missed the point of the original, as another reviewer on IMDb correctly put it. The thing has to be alone in the room with you for it to get ahold of your cells. This is completely urinated all over in the film, as if the writers haven't seen the original film. And this isn't helped by a big lipped alligator moment near the end, which in addition to being in a last act that tries to explain The Thing, features a scene where Kate jumps on top of the spaceship and a bizarre video/hologram thingy starts. A total nuke the fridge moment.

In short, I don't know what to think about this film at all. It isn't bad, and I would watch it before the latest Michael Bay movie, indeed, but unfortunately, it seems all too obvious that this won't be one I can recommend. Not even to fans of the original, mainly because it's as if it were designed for people with low attention spans. That said, strangely enough, I would say it's worth watching at least once- that's just how polarizing the film is.

OVERALL: 5/10

THE GOOD: The Thing is a nicely atmospheric and shot prequel to the first movie, which features nice creepy tension and a good amount of scares.

THE BAD: In addition to being a rehash, it seems like it's rather just the first movie designed for people with A.D.D. and methadone for The Thing addicts.",1320451200,,4880,4.476940382452193
4850881,2,B005NYMXIU,"(Spoilers may follow)

If you have seen the 1982 Carpenter film, there aren't too many things that are new here. Very few things.

If you called this a ""remake"" instead of a ""prequel"", you wouldn't be wrong.

The studios obviously didn't want hardcore fans who loved the original to go into this thinking they would be getting the same ""thing"" (pun intended) over again and not bother with this movie. Instead labeling this movie as a ""prequel"" would be a better marketing move to attract new fans who have never seen the cult classic and thus would not have to fear disappointment for shelling out movie for this movie (if they disliked it).

The movie feels  more like a remake than a prequel. The same events that happen in 82 remake happen in 2011 remake.

I am not calling this a prequel since there is very little in the way of actual background to the origins of the thing. Where does ""The Thing"" come from? Nope writers never bothered to explain that.

What kind of species is it? Nope let's not explain that either. Where does it gain it's power? Nope.

I think this hurt the film significantly (since it has bombed in the box office since its opening). It would have been great to get some insight into how exactly the Thing came to earth. It would have shown me some initiative here to differentiate itself from Carpenter classic.

Everything that happens in the movie is pretty much lifted or inspired from the Carpenter film.

Plot: An alien craft lands in Antarctica (check), the expedition finds the craft and are threatened by the alien who came out of it (check). They slowly become prey for the creature who also begins to imitate the crew until all of them are wiped out (check).

Only differences between this and 82 classic is changing the script with the characters and circumstances in which the characters meet their ghastly end.  As you recall in the 82 film the American crew are the victims of the ""Thing"". In this one the Norwegians are the victims of the thing creature.

To avoid the obvious comparisons of the 82 movie, director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and writers
decide to introduce a female hero(contrasting with Kurt Russell's MacReady).

There is as well definitely a lot more gore in this movie than the 82 movie.

The special effects were ok in some areas, and average in others. Some effects didn't even look like they were finished.

Don't know what else to add. It's pretty much a coin toss to see this movie.

I didn't think it was anything special. I've seen all this before. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.",1319846400,,2569,4.6233480176211454
4850882,3,B005NYMXIU,"It's hard to criticize a movie like The Thing - the 2011 film by first-time director Matthijs van Heijningen - as it is in fact a good movie and very well done. And had John Carpenter never made his 1982 version of The Thing (which itself was a remake of the 1951 scifi/horror classic The Thing From Another World), then this would have been a great movie. But Carpenter did make his film and therein lies the problem.

The problem is that, while this new film is written as a prequel to the 1982 film (and why couldn't they have come up with some slightly different name, btw?) and slavishly dedicates itself to that purpose, it does not for the most part add anything to the story. Certainly not enough to warrant an entire film being made. If you've seen the earlier film, then nothing in this prequel comes as a surprise. And if somehow you never saw the earlier film, then there's no real point to seeing it after the prequel as nothing in it will come as a surprise either.

4850883,3,B005NYMXIU,"John Carpenter's version of The Thing is a horror classic that has not only stood the test of time, but is considered by many to be one of the best horror movies ever. The desire to return to the 1982 film to attempt and capture a similar atmosphere in a modern motion picture is understandable, but the journey is likely to not only tarnish its reputation but weaken the impact it once had. Despite being held in such high regard, it's not like The Thing is a huge money maker. The 1982 film didn't even break $20 million at the domestic box office and didn't really become a success until it was released on VHS. Fast forward nearly thirty years and a new version of The Thing has covertly made its way into theaters or at least that's what it would like to lead you to believe.

The Thing has a pretty decent opening. What's a modern day R-rated horror movie without a really terrible raunchy joke to break the ice (pun intended) minutes before everything hits the fan? The scenery is kind of breathtaking, as well. The roaming shot that opens the film where we see many of the snow caps in ""Antarctica"" along with most of the scenic shots are fairly beautiful. There's something about vast, snowy landscapes and icy structures that's mesmerizing.

The special effects are probably the main reason to see The Thing. Many horror fans that have seen the prequel are upset that the film relied so much on CG, but I found them rather extraordinary. There's a mix of both practical effects and computer generation for a result that is both gnarly and out of this world. It's not so much that CG is so relevant in films nowadays that turns me off of it it's the amount of cheap-looking CG that constantly gets used. In regards to living up to Carpenter's film, The Thing came closest with how the creature looked. That along with how everything happening seemed to explain events in the 1982 version are a drawing factor. The Thing feels like a remake, but the events that unfold explain what happened leading up to the opening shot in Carpenter's film. The sound effects also at least make the film worth a viewing in the theater. The creature's sounds alone are pretty intense. The score wasn't necessarily memorable, but was just subtle enough and just enough to put you on the edge to add a little bit to the film. Lastly, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the most decent part of the cast. She's no R.J. MacReady, but she has the most developed personality.

Unfortunately The Thing pretty much has everyTHING working against it despite showing quite a bit of potential. It has the blandest dialogue. Everything is so boring and monotone. All of the characters feel one-dimensional, as well; paper thin. Character development is mostly nonexistent. The jump scares feel cheap and it's so dead set on staying close to Carpenter's vision that it isn't able to establish an identity of its own. The ""test"" in the prequel is beyond weak and the film's constant absence of logic becomes groan-worthy.

In the 1982 film, Childs (Keith David) says at one point ""If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know it was really me?"" This version of The Thing aspires to be a perfect imitation of Carpenter's version and it crashes and burns. It barely passes as an imperfect imitation. The way it relies on Carpenter's film as a crutch hurts it more than anything. However the special effects at least make it worth seeing in the theater. Although disappointing, The Thing is somewhat decent, better than what most review sites are giving it credit for, and moderately entertaining.",1319500800,,3581,4.67936507936508

Little things like the ax in the wall that Kurt Russell sees when he first visits the Norwegian base, the burnt thing outside the base as well as so many other little similarities which perfectly link the two movies. It was very well done and completely took me off guard as I expected this to be a quick slasher remake just to make cash for Universal.

They did a great job of respecting the original work and perfectly blending the end of this film into the beginning of the 1982 version of The Thing with Kurt Russell. Make sure you stay for the credits as little clips connect to the start of the 1982 version.

Yes, The Thing alien was pretty much all CGI, however they did a really good job of it and some things actually surprised me how well they did it and how far they took it. The cast and acting was perfect and felt right throughout the film. Yes, it lacked some character development, however they used fear and the casts reactions as a solid character introduction.

Nothing will ever top the 1982 version of The Thing, however this 2011 version of The Thing is a perfect Prequel to that and I could not have asked for a better horror flick. One recommendation I have is that if you see the 2011 The Thing in theaters or watch it at home on Blu, make sure to clear your schedule and watch the 2011 version and the 1982 version back to back. You will be quite surprised by the similarities and the amazing level of detail to each and every scene. The makers of the 2011 The Thing must be huge fans of the 1982 version as they made a perfect prequel to such an amazing film.",1318982400,,2139,4.635883905013193
4850887,3,B005NYMXIU,"When it comes to remakes, sequels, or prequels, doing anything involving classic films is a very risky business, even more so when dealing with one of the most beloved films of horror cinema.  Any filmmaker involved in the process can only do their best, and hope that fans won't tear them apart upon releasing a companion piece to their treasured masterpiece.  The best they can probably hope for is to at least make an entertaining movie that can at least compliment what has come before, and in that aspect, ""The Thing"" manages to succeed.

Taking place three days before the beginning of John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name, ""The Thing,"" follows a group of Norwegian explorers and scientists in Antarctica, who have found a spaceship buried under the ice, as well as what appears to be an alien life-form.  But their joy and excitement quickly turn to fear when the alien escapes, and is revealed not only to be incredibly bloodthirsty, but also capable of copying and mimicking any life-form it comes across...including people.

From the very beginning, ""The Thing"" has the unenviable task of standing in Carpenter's shadow, and despite it's best efforts, it comes off as something imitating the original while trying to be it's own thing: with a breakneck pace (thus having very little time for character development), heavier emphasis on deaths and gruesome body transformations, ""The Thing"" feels like an action film, rather then a horror film, and isn't particularly scary.  The fact that it relies very heavily on obvious CGI to bring it's monster to life, rather then practical effects, also hurts as well, because after seeing the astonishing puppet and make-up effects in the original, having pixels running about on the screen doesn't have the same impact.

Yet, despite the differences in tone, the use of CGI over practical effects, and the lack of scares, amazingly, ""The Thing"" really isn't that bad.  It's fast pace means there's no time to be bored with what's going on, the action is constant and interesting to watch, and even though almost all of it is CGI, the sheer amount of body parts, teeth, claws, and tentacles waving about on screen is compelling enough to follow, and the ending, while having some continuity problems in terms of character appearances, does tie into the original very well.

Overall, ""The Thing"" has the unique distinction of being an unnecessary addition to the ""Thing"" franchise, yet is entertaining in it's own right.  Unlike other series where some installments can cheapen or spoil an entire franchise, ""The Thing"" is a brisk entry that, while not as grand as the original, is still a fun watch.",1318809600,3,2657,4.950561797752809
4850888,5,B005NYMXIU,"We saw this in the theater last night. Incredible action, excellent special effects. Anyone who is a fan of the Kurt Russell version will not be disappointed. The director and writer did an excellent job of utilizing familiar parts of the previous movie while still putting original touches of their own on this one. Go see it. Great night out and worth the price of seeing it on the big screen, even though we have a big screen TV.",1318723200,,432,4.481012658227848
4850889,4,B005NYMXIU,"There always seemed more to the story of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". The new 2011 isn't a sequel to Carpenter's classic film which was closer to John W. Campbell's original novella than the 1951 film. In fact, this film plays more like a remake of the 1951 Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks with the way the story is set up and the characters. This 2011 prequel manages to throw in a couple of surprises for fans of the 1982 film while also staying faithful to what we know from the 1982 film. The director and writer bring in a few unique twists and it is surprisingly well cast.

SPOILERS:

While tracking a strange signal a group of Norweigans discover an ancient buried spaceship when the ice they are traveling over collapses. Calling in an American Dr. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to help Dr. Sandor Halvorson determine what type of creature they've discovered trapped in the ice. When Halvorson insists on drilling into the cake of ice the creature is trapped in for a tissue sample against Lloyd's advice, they unleash a creature that immitates humans perfectly and is designed to survive something that the Norweigans are NOT prepared to face.

END OF SPOILERS:

Writer Eric Heisserer does an expert job of reverse engineering the screenplay from what we saw in Carpenter's film about the remains of the creature and the Noreweigan base. While that by itself wouldn't be enough to recommend the film writer Heisserer and director Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr. do an expert job of creating a sense of suspense (although not the feeling of impending doom and dread that Carpenter so expertly puts on display in the 1982 film)even though we know what is coming playing on the fact that the audience may have knowledge while the characters are completely in the dark.

There are a couple of minor flaws in the film. One we can't help--it's the fact that we know the outcome (somewhat although the writer and director throw a few surprises into the film at the conclusion)and dramatically that Dr. Lloyd makes a huge leap of logic as to what the creature can do based on a cursorary examination of the cells and the remains of one of the attacked members of the team. While it might work for those who might have seen the 1982 film more casual fans or those who haven't seen the 1982 film will be a bit puzzled by it. Still, that's the worst of the film's sins. The other flaw is that while the casting is quite good for most of the main characters they aren't quite as memorable as those created for the 1982 film and the casting director doesn't have the opportunity to rely on the strong group of American character actors that populate the 1982 film. Still, the the producers and directors do work wonders with the cast that they have particularly Winstead who does a fine job recalling the character of Ripley from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" as she takes charge of the group.

The director creates a creature that while it recalls what it is in the 1982 film is more brazen and reckless (as something inexperienced with humans might be)when it comes to attacks on members of the crew. We also get explanations as to why certain things occur in the 1982 film that are never fully explained (although they probably didn't need to be).

The score by Marto Beltrani adds to the suspense of the film and, at the conclusion, uses Ennio Moricone's classic score from the 1982 film. The CGI and physical effects work very well and visually the creature appears quite unique at times but still recalling what we know of it from the 1982 film.

There are certainly those who are going to be disappointed by the prequel but the writers and directors do an exceptional job with what they have to work with and, in some respects, the tone of the film recalls the relationship that exists between the films ""Alien"" and ""Aliens""; each film shared a central premise but each also goes its own way (although the director here has much less wiggle room with the story).

As a straight forward horror filck the 2011 prequel ""The Thing"" is quite good and stays remarkably true to what we see in Carpenter's classic film.

Recommended.",1318723200,4,4125,4.6772413793103444
4850890,5,B005NYMXIU,"I just saw this movie on the big screen last night and I loved it!!!!  I also loved the old one with Kurt Russell.  The special effects are excellent!  The story line is close enough so you know you are watching what you came to watch, a remake of The Thing, yet there are some differences at the same time, plus a clever ending, which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't seen the movie!  The clever ending is revealed while the credits are rolling.

Though I have seen and loved Kurt Russell's version of The Thing and I knew what was going to happen, the movie was still terrifying and kept me on the edge of my seat! I loved this movie and plan to buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out!",1318723200,2,696,4.0144927536231885

The special effects are improved on the original but, again, stay true to the original.  There were also some great suspensful tension that had me jumping up and down in my kitchen while saying, ""Oh no, oh no, oh NO!""  Also it has a younger Tourmand which is awesome because I have been missing Game of Thrones.  Seriously check it out.",1529366400,,485,4.465909090909091

8480828,4,B005NYMXIU,"The Thing (2011) is a nice prequel to the The Thing (1982) which itself was a remake of a film from a few decades before that.  In fact the end scenes of this film are the opening scenes of John Carpenter's film.  This film is more like a remake though, although it's probably more authentic that the Norwegian base would have the same sort of equipment (flamethrowers and so forth) that the American one had so they would cope with the same threat the same way.  But you can't help but think when seeing characters do the same thing, that gee it would have been nice to come up with something new.  But saying that this is still enjoyable.  The creature in this one seemed to be a bit more intelligent or smoothly able to pretend it's one of the crew than it could at the American base.  I wondered in this one why no one tries having a conversation with it, reasoning with it to spare them and they'll help it with its needs.  Where as the 1982 version it was simply a wounded creature trying to survive, masking it's predators so it could wipe out this threat to itself.  The CGI is heavily used in the prequel, which I think takes away some of what made the original the cult classic it is. They should have invested in robotic puppets.

You can see why this prequel wasn't more successful.  It called itself the exact same title, confusing many that it was a remake and we all know how some people automatically pan remakes, not giving them a chance, even though they've never seen them because it's somehow going to ruin the original, even though that makes absolutely no sense.  It doesn't have A-list actors as a draw card.  The ones do a perfectly adequate job.  But if you're a fan of the 1982 film, you should definitely check it out.  If you haven't seen that, you should watch these back to back.",1527724800,,1809,4.377245508982036
