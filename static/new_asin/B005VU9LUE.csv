8487656,1,B005VU9LUE,"Three painful films (to sit through)! I usually trust Criterion to choose worthwhile films, but I have been burned a few times by the films they release in their lower-budget cult sets under the Eclipse subsidiary. These three films are the worst set that I have purchased so far. The director utilizes amateur-looking title and comment crawls across the screen in two of the films that lower the level of the work to that of a cheesy Power Point presentation. I made it through all three... But I certainly regret buying this set.",1452556800,,531,4.720430107526882
8487657,5,B005VU9LUE,"for the movie ""My Crasy Life"" to come out on VHS/DVD. Ever since about 95-96 when I heard the Cabaret Voltaire song ""Lo Cool"" on their album ""Plasticity"". That song samples a section of this movie and sets it against a stark electronic background. After waiting so long I was afraid of being disappointed, but that fear was unfounded. This is a great docudrama about the life of the Sons of Samoa street gang. I haven't yet viewed the other two films in this set and I might not ever because I really only wanted ""My Crasy Life"".",1329696000,3,529,4.408163265306122
