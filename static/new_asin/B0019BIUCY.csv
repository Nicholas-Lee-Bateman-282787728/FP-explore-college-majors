8273335,5,B0019BIUCY,"I grew up with a parent that mocked the Rocky movies. We'd laugh that when I had children, they'd see Rocky 50. I started by watching the movie ""Creed"" in theaters last fall. That led me to back up and watch the full series. I first purchased Rocky I and II. They showed me that the main character was a decent human being and also a true gentleman. I really wasn't expecting to see that. I ended up renting then buying the rest of the series. I am now a HUGE fan of both the Rocky movies as well as Sylvester Stallone. These movies aren't just for folks who enjoy boxing. They are for anyone who appreciates decent human beings and seeing their real life. I'll avoid spoilers by posting any further. Enjoy! =)",1461456000,,710,4.3059701492537314
