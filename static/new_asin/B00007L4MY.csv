7977754,1,B00007L4MY,"I banked on this documentary being something I could use for a research project. I sent for it and got it just in time to do the project only to find out there's NOTHING OF EDUCATIONAL VALUE IN HERE. There are no concrete facts, and nothing with historical basis.
You can't make a DVD pretending to be about Hip Hop when all it is is hip hop artists telling their tale of success, (what success? I've never heard of you!)
Don't let the gimicky promotional stuff fool you, if you're genuinely interested in the progression and roots of latino hip hop, you can't find it here.",1272326400,,574,4.4245283018867925
7977755,5,B00007L4MY,"This is one of the best Latin hip hop documentaries out there. It was one of the first to document the struggle of brown hip hop artists in the music industry, and it was the first to showcase the new generation of artists who are currently making noise (La Sinfonia, Los Tumbados, Conejo...). With this in mind, it is not difficult to realize that those behind this documentary knew the importance of this story/project. I won't say much about the story, but you have to see it for your self. The extra features such as the Kinto Sol & Los Tumbados music videos are a nice bonus. There is a ton of education and material in this DVD. Definetly worth its price. Get yourself a copy!",1127260800,5,682,4.420634920634921
7977756,5,B00007L4MY,"I was skeptical at first but a Chicano Studies Professor at Arizona State University recommended it to me a while back. Finally, I viewed the film for myself and WOW, the best documentary I seen in some time.  This is Xicano/Latin Hip Hop at it's finest.  The music is dope, the interviews are mind blowing, tons of entertaining learning materials for musicians.  The DVD is packed with extras gallore:  More interviews, Kinto Sol and Los Tumbados Music Videos, Very dope Graffiti Poem called ""Passion of Existence"", Lowriders, Freestyles, and more. WOW!!!  Can't wait for the UMD so I can take the film everywhere I go!  I agree with the last reviewer, ""This film is a Xicano Classic Film!""  I recommend you BUY IT, no matter what race you are!",1122508800,5,745,4.728682170542636
7977757,5,B00007L4MY,"What more can anyone say?  I seen this movie at the Arclight Theatre in Hollywood, CA, and it blew my mind.  As an aspiring MC, I learned tons about the biz, especially from Psycho Realm, Delinquent Habits, and ODM.  From contracts to marketing, and much more!  The movie also has interviews and freestyles from the now school of hip hop: Ill Fame, now known as La Sinfonia, Conejo, and Los Tumbados.  Buy this film people, because we need more films from the likes of Safada Y Sano Production!  The creditals for PASS THE MIC! speak for themselves:  Voted #1 in Vibe, honored by American Film Institute, tons of reviews and screenings around the world y todo. Does anyone know if it will be released on UMD?  Now that would be dope!",1121644800,6,733,4.541984732824427
