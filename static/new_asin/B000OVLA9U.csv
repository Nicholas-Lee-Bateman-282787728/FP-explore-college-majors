In my freshman year in high school, I was in Mathletes.  A year later, when other Black students saw me in the Mathletes photo they cracked up.  I was giggling myself because I too admit that it's odd or funny to see the bruthaboy up in some Mathletes.  (I stopped doing it as I was third-string anyway.)  In college, I met a Black man who went to Andover and he was very proud of having participated on the school's water polo team.  To him, he was breaking barriers when it comes to what Blacks, especially males, will or won't do.  This work had that same vibe.  Even one interviewee said, ""People compare Black motorcyclists to Black hockey players.""
This work was vastly different from documentaries on majority bikers.  The majority likes supporting the idea that they are dangerous.  These Black bikers stated that many members are veterans or police officers.  They go to great lengths to distance themselves from ""gangs.""
I have some problems with this work.  It focused more on other Blacks' deeming the activity ""inauthentic"" than it did on racism from non-Black bikers.  There is a pronounced history of keeping Blacks out of bikers's clubs and this work just briefly touches upon that.  Though the work was diverse in terms of age, gender, and region, I thought the work was lesbophobic.  Several interviewees used an epithet for lesbians and thought nothing of it.  What about Black lesbian bikers?!  They had one in the film ""Biker Boyz.""
Finally, this got boring quick.  Listening to anyone speak about his hobby is not something I need to do for a whole hour.  So you like biking?  Okay, onto the next topic!",1243728000,,1720,4.75
