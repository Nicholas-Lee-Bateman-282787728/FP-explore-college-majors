4215151,3,B003X3BY7O,"This set says it's a fan favorite collection but it's really just the first five volumes collected together,so it's not nothing new. Fourtunely,I did not own the first five vols. so I suppose its alright.",1315008000,4,204,4.857142857142857
4215152,4,B003X3BY7O,"My two main problems with this collection is that there are only 19 episodes included, and that a few of my favorites are not included.  Other than that, I think it is a fantastic set, and particularly giftable, what with coming in a nice tin.  Plus I have to say that it does take time to get through all of the episodes, as one rather does have to parcel them out.  Either you don't want to overload on weird and creepy, or you want to savor the excellence.  And these are excellent episodes, all of them either thought-provoking or sleep-disturbing.  Even the ones with the most corny special effects at least wonder how terrifying they would be with really convincing effects.

One of the most striking qualities of these Twilight Zone Favorites is the way in which they have retained their relevancy.  They are obviously set in the time they were filmed, of course, and have accumulated a charming air of nostalgia, but the fears they deal with are still very relevant, for the most part.  For example, modern society has come up with quite a few more options for causing the feared apocalypse than cold-war era worries about nuclear annihilation.  However, this hardly detracts from the collection's appeal.  The special features, however, are not so special, being simple text with a particularly annoying and repetitive sound track.  They were informative, but went through pages automatically, rather than at my choice, and at a pace almost too fast to read more than half before it would switch.

Aside from this annoying feature, I would recommend this collection to anyone who is not such a huge fan of the Twilight Zone that they are searching for something more along the lines of the complete series or full seasons.  It makes a fairly good introduction to the show, especially as a gift from a fan to a potential fan.  Just remember, in the end, we all spend time in the Twilight Zone, if only in our darker dreams.",1300665600,12,1931,4.708333333333333
4215153,3,B003X3BY7O,"It's both amazing and disappointing that this 2010 release is identical to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Zone-40th-Anniversary-Gift-Pack/dp/6305556806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Zone: 40th Anniversary Gift Pack</a>&nbsp;from roughly 10 years ago, with the exception of the special features. Of the 19 episodes, less than half are truly classic. If you check out the reviews of the 40th anniversary set, you'll see how many fan favorites are missing. Personally, I would have voted for these additions:
* To Serve Man
* Midnight Sun
* The Eye of the Beholder
* The Hitchhiker
* The Living Doll
* It's a Good Life

Hard to believe that in the past 10 years they couldn't put together a better collection.",1295395200,23,773,6.027272727272727
4215154,5,B003X3BY7O,"This ""Twilight Zone"" tin box set certainly is missing some key episodes, but not a legitimate reason to rate this product one or two stars. The transfers are remastered and brilliant, there's nineteen good solid episodes in this five disc set, each disc is placed securely in a thin plastic cover with a Twilight Zone designed tin box. In all actuality what you're getting here is the first five volumes that were previously released in 2001, these episodes were not specially chosen as favorites, they're already classics. One problem is that most of you may probably own all five seasons, for those of you not wanting to spend the dollars for the high priced full collection, this set is perfect for a small glance of entering another dimension, even though it is missing ""To Serve Man"" a.k.a. ""The Menu"", ""Eye Of The Beholder"", - can be found on volumes 8 & 43 for three dollars plus shipping from an Amazon seller, including other episodes for each vol... maybe not all the fans favorites here, but you gotta love ""The Invaders"", Agnes Moorehead gives a stunningly, intense acting performance without saying one single word.  (five stars to raise the rating up for this quality product) edit update 5/23/11: the price for this set recently sky rocketed here at Amazon, why? probably for the collectable tin box version, the newer cardboard packaging of the same title is now available at the reasonable original price.",1289260800,37,1422,4.87603305785124
4215155,3,B003X3BY7O,"This collection has some good choices like Terror at 20,000 feet, Time Enough At Last, and The Invaders. But  there are some real dud episodes here too. And it is incomprehensible how they could put together a ""Fan Favorite"" collection and leave out the classic episode ""To Serve Man"". How about ""Eye of the Beholder""? How about ""Living Doll""? Five stars for The Twilight Zone as a series, but only three stars for this collection of some fan favorites and some obvious lesser episodes they are using to pad the collection out. I predict they are planning on bringing out soon another ""Fan Favorite"" collection with the rest of the real fan favorites and more lesser episodes so they can gouge more money from the fans. Disappointing.",1286841600,14,734,4.7795275590551185
4215156,2,B003X3BY7O,"I get the idea of a cash grab Image, especially in regards to one of, if not
the most imaginative and inspiring television series of all time.

But why is ""Probe 7 - Over and Out"" included?...just a terrible episode.

If anything the episode ""Two"" (Elizabeth Montgomery/Charles Bronson)
tells a very similar story, told it first (2nd Season), and tells it much better.

Hope there are some extras here otherwise just no point in another dip.

If you have yet to bring any Twilight Zone's home, go for the FULL seasons instead.

You won't be disappointed.",1282608000,15,554,4.729166666666667

4215212,3,B003X3BY7O,"For the life of me, I can't understand why they picked three-quarters of the episodes that they included in this ""FAN FAVORITES"".

I mean they missed the bulls-eye on this one.  There are a handful of great (famous) episodes on this blu-ray, but the majority are ho-hum episodes (yes there were some)... and they decided to include them in this disc.  My question is WHY????  How could you have a ""FAN FAVORITES"" and not include the episode with Lloyd Bochner (To Serve Man) with a young Richard Keil as one of the TALL aliens.(Cannibus)

Boy was I disappointed. The cover blurb led me to believe there were some special features on this little set too, but what they have stinks. There are a few paragraphs of text on screens you have to tediously page through, that's it. No audio commentary, no little video profile of Rod Serling, no nothing. I even found the menu scheme annoying. I was constantly making the wrong selection even though there are only THREE options! That's how badly they named the options.

So if you just want a DVD of a few semi-random (certainly not the best) TZ episodes, go ahead and shell out your $20. Just be aware that that's all there is.",1339977600,9,977,5.7379310344827585
4215215,3,B003X3BY7O,"This is actually a decent idea, to put a bluray together with some of the best TZ episodes in one set.  Problem is, they did a bad job in picking out titles...  I will break it down, episode by episode.

Night of the Meek- Solid episode, but it can only be truly enjoyed during the holiday season. And while it is good, it's not one of the very best, in my opinion.

The Invaders-No argument here.  It belongs, although it's not a personal favorite of mine.

Nothing in the Dark-Great episode with a young Robert Redford. It belongs.

Time Enough at Last-Easily top 5 episode of the entire run. It's the episode to show newbies to get them interested. Good that it was included.

Nightmare at 20,000 Feet-Another classic that clearly belongs.  Shatner was phenomenal in this.

The Monsters are Due on Maple Street-Solid episode, but not a favorite for me. Still, an argument can be made that it belongs.

The Odyssey of Flight 33-Good episode, but I wouldn't want it in this set...

Steel-recently popularized by the new movie..  I'm a huge boxing fan, so I like this episode and The Big Tall Wish. Neither belongs in a best of the best edition of TZ though.

A Game of Pool-A masterpiece by both Klugman and Winters. Clearly belongs.

Walking Distance-As a kid I didn't think much of it... As a middle aged guy, I totally get it...  A classic. It belongs and sits near the head of the class.

Kick the Can- As a kid I didn't think much of it... And as an adult I don't think much of it. It bores me. It shouldn't be in this volume, plain and simple. There are better episodes that could have taken its place.

Mr. Dingle the Strong- This episode is actually kind of funny.. I like it, but critically it wasn't well received. Shouldn't have made the cut, even with the great Burgess Meredith at the helm.

Two-Meh. Was OK, but another episode that isn't one of the episodes that people talk about when they talk great TZ episodes.

A Passage for Trumpet-Compassionate and thoughtful episode...  It belongs, and Klugman shines.

The Four of Us are Dying-Good episode. The case for it's inclusion can be argued.

Long Distance Call-A solid Billy Mumy episode, although I think his ""It's a Good Life"" would have been a better fit for this collection, as the episode was more memorable, and the film would have transferred better to bluray than the video footage of LD Call.

I Sing the Body Electric- Nothing wrong with the episode really, but it wouldn't be on my list. Not the greatest story by Bradbury, in my opinion.

The Lonely-Solid episode... I have no qualms with its inclusion here.

Probe 7 - Over and Out- Have no idea why it's on this list... Yea, no idea at all.  Very forgettable.

So there you have it.  Out of the nineteen episodes, I count nine that belong in a best of TZ collection... There were many episodes that should have been here that are far more beloved than some of the episodes that I highlighted.  Case in point, just a sampling of the excellent episodes they left out...  To Serve Man, Death's Head Revisited, Perchance to Dream, Stop at Willoughby, After Hours, Obsolete Man, Living Doll, Nick of Time, The Hitchhiker, Long Live Walter Jameson, and so many more. I could go on and on... The collection as is is ok, but if you're going to make a best of compilation, every title should be an absolute hit.

Just my two cents.  As it stands, the compilation gets a 3/5 for content.",1339113600,30,3410,4.519607843137255
