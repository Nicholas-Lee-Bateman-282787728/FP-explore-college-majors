5036769,3,B006XEH7EO,"My wife and I were fortunate enough to have seen this new restoration of one of the landmarks of film, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s' A TRIP TO THE MOON, at its third presentation last year. That was on September 6, 2011 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. And, believe it or not, EVERY SEAT (over 1000!) was taken and there were hundreds of people outside hoping for ""no-show"" seats (I understand there were none!) And this for a 1902 film!

This film had not been seen in a color version in over 100 years. For anyone not familiar with it, it is one of the seminal motion pictures and it was, at the time it was produced, one of the longest films yet made (about 15 minutes) and it was certainly one of the most elaborate.

Most people have seen the iconic image of the moon being struck in the 'eye' by the rocket and many people have seen the entire film - but never like this!

In addition to the color, much more of the left side of the image is now visible and there are two additional scenes which appear in no other edition and have not been seen since the first release of the film.

How did they get color in 1902? Each color release print was hand-painted frame by frame!

I had the opportunity, after the Academy showing to speak personally with Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films (who restored this film) as well as Tom Burton of Technicolor Restoration Services who handled the 'nitty-gritty' work in preparing the film for exhibition. Their enthusiasm was VERY apparent and VERY contagious. I can tell you that the entire audience was thrilled and amazed.

(Tom Burton and his Technicolor team were the people involved with the amazing and wonderful restoration of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wings-Blu-ray/dp/B0067MLCEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wings [Blu-ray</a>] [also available as the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wings/dp/B0067MLCD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wings</a>] which I also recommend to all.)

The A TRIP TO THE MOON film was shown twice that evening along with other newly restored early [c. 1900] films, some, believe it or not, in 3D and color!!! What an evening that was! These films all had to be seen to be believed!

One of the remarkable things about the restoration of A TRIP TO THE MOON is the decision to leave the print exactly as it was originally. This particular print, the only color one which survived, was made for a distributor in Spain. Hence, after the projectile is pushed into the 'gun' by the ladies, you will see a flag - and it is NOT the French Tricolor; rather it is the red-yellow-red Spanish flag, which was painted that way for the Spanish audiences. (Serge Bromberg told me that it could have been changed to the Tricolor but, in the interest of the authenticity and integrity of this particular print, the restorers decided to leave it just as it was. I APPLAUD that decision!)

So you will see this particular print almost exactly as it was seen in 1902.

That evening at the Academy, the film was shown twice, the first time with accompaniment by the music group AIR (the 'official' music for this release), the second time with something much more appropriate: Serge Bromberg reading Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s' own script.

My wife and I were not keen on AIR's music; neither were most of the people to whom we spoke afterwards.

Even with AIR's music though, the evening was one of those rare magical events people attend only a few times in their lives. We'll never forget it.

Of course, NONE of this would mean anything at all if the film A TRIP TO THE MOON itself were not good. But it is - as its thousands of prints and showings over the years attest. Frankly, not only is the movie a breakthrough in cinema history, it is a great deal of fun. (I wonder if those participating in its creation could have envisioned that people 110 years later would still be watching it and enjoying it?)

Do you remember what the Internet was like in its early days? Primitive, sometimes frustrating, but new and exciting and with such promise of what was to come ...

That is exactly what this film was to cinema.

Thus it is with profound regret that I have to tell you why I am giving this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Trip-to-the-Moon-Restored-Limited-Edition-Steelbook-Blu-ray/dp/B006XEH7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Trip to the Moon Restored (Limited Edition, Steelbook)  [Blu-ray</a>] only three stars (and why I feel that I'm being generous).

AIR's music is even more dreadful than I had remembered it from the Academy showing of September 6, 2011. I'm sure that some (who knows, maybe even most) people will like it but this is MY opinion: it's AWFUL and COMPLETELY inappropriate for this film!

AIR's track is the ONLY audio option you have when watching the restored color version. This is unconscionable, again in my opinion.

I do not know why ANYONE would have commissioned such a group to write music for this film. I can only assume that someone hoped to attract a 'younger' and 'hip' audience for this film. Perhaps AIR or their recording company helped with the funding of the restoration. But I believe that the thinking behind commissioning and writing this score were severely flawed - such music CANNOT add to the enjoyment of a film such as this one (and the 'hip' kids aren't even going to WATCH this film, much less buy it) - and I believe the fact that this score is the ONLY one available accompanying the restored color version is a disgrace, not at all keeping with the tone of the film.

Within the Bonus section, the black-and-white version of the film is presented. There are three audio choices available for that version, any one of which would have been better for accompanying the color version. But we have no choice in that regard.

We SHOULD have been given similar audio choices for the color version (including AIR's music for those who want it). Period.

What a shame - after all the magnificent, difficult, expensive, and time-consuming restoration work done by Serge Bromberg, Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage - to have released a travesty like this (and I'm referring only to this particular Blu-ray/DVD set).

I myself will be watching the color version 'mute,' that is, with the sound turned off or I may record one of the tracks from the B&W version and play that in conjunction with the color version.

That's the only way I'll ever watch this again.

I must tell you that this set does not, in my opinion, represent good value for money. We get the color version of the film (about 15 minutes), a documentary (quite fascinating, about an hour in length - but I cannot imagine anyone watching it more than two or three times), an interview with AIR, the B&W version mentioned (another 15 minutes), and two other Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s shorts (both of which were previously released on Flicker Alley's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Georges-Melies-First-Wizard-of-Cinema-1896-1913/dp/B0013K8J90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Georges Melies: First Wizard of Cinema 1896-1913</a>&nbsp;set; together they run about 12 minutes).

That's it!

The DVD has exactly the same program as the Blu-ray. I cannot understand Flicker Alley's rationale for selling this set in this way.

I shouldn't tell you this but, if you want to see the color restoration of A TRIP TO THE MOON, it is easily found, albeit illegally I'm sure, all over the web. And though I certainly do NOT recommend this, you can download it for free if you wish. I normally would not even mention such a thing except for the fact that I am so utterly disappointed with this Blu-ray/DVD set.

Please take into consideration that my negative comments apply ONLY to this Blu-ray/DVD release, NOT - repeat NOT - to the magnificent color restoration effected by the people involved. The colors in the restoration are positively breathtaking and seeing this movie in color radically transforms it (at least for me).

(Please note that the audio error in the original Blu-ray disc has been corrected, the requested replacement discs have been mailed, and all sets purchased from now on will contain the remastered disc.)

Flicker Alley contacted me and said that, if I wished to return the set, they would refund my money (that was very fair of them). I shall not do this (I'll keep my set), mostly out of sympathy with Flicker Alley, a small, very dedicated, company which desires to make significant films of the past available on video for the enjoyment of all.

But this is the last time I'll ever pre-order any video release; I shall wait to see other peoples' reviews first!

Other reviewers here on Amazon are very positive about this release but obviously I myself cannot and will not recommend that you buy this set - and I am truly, truly sorry to have to write that.",1331683200,153,9049,5.014676450967311

Why only two stars then? It's the soundtrack. The disc includes several black & white versions, with the major difference between then being the audio; you get a narrated version, based on a script written by Melies, another with voice acting, based on a 1903 performance accompanied by piano - and lastly, you get the usual silent treatment with piano music only.

The color version, which is supposed to be the highlight of this set, is not so lucky. In fact, it's downright shafted; rather than any kind of sensible audio option, you get a contemporary avant-garde soundtrack by the French band Air - and this is the only audio option available for the color version. Personally, I did not enjoy the soundtrack for the color version at all, and with what I consider to be the superior audio options restricted to the black & white version, I really do feel let down by this release, regardless of all the other features.",1408233600,8,1130,4.616915422885572

I enjoyed his film shorts immensely. Special Features were outstanding as well .Back then the films were short due to lack of technology and resources but were remarkable and groundbreaking at the time. There was nothing to compare it to. The USA certainly wasn't doing this in 1898. This is one of my most prized DVD's and I am very grateful and honored that I had a chance to get it. Years ago I saw the moon face on a music video and never knew what it was about but I was always curious. Putting A Trip to the Moon in a steelbook plus Blu-Ray was an added bonus.

This film set contains both a short film and a documentary. The short film (A trip to the Moon) is of historical importance in itself, but the documentary that accompanies this film is what made the purchase worth it for me. It is amazing how many films were completely lost over the course of the last century, but a very few noteworthy ones managed to survive anyway because of the hard work of certain individuals.. I found the admission price for me a little high for a film that I will not watch often, but I am glad I bought it anyway.

If you are considering purchasing this product, take the previous reviewer's advice (actually, the advice they didn't offer) and check it out on the net first.

5036784,5,B006XEH7EO,"The old: George Melies's ""Trip to the Moon."" It's one of the true classics of silent film, lovingly restored to near pristine condition. This truly comes from another era - so many of the visual idioms are so far from contemporary experience that it's meaningless to discuss them in modern terms. (I'm thinking of the chorus line of curvy dancers loading the projectile for launch.) Instead, it has to be taken for what it is, leaving the modern viewer to wonder what it was to its original audiences.

The new: Effort spanning decades in applying the most modern technology to its restoration, a work of art in itself. A hand-colored print of the movie was found nearly 20 years ago, in precarious condition and decaying fast. The conservators managed get the images, despite the crumbling film, with chemical decay gluing the reel into a solid mass. It came apart in fingernail-sized pieces, each of which was carefully photographed and saved for the day when technology could stitch the images back together. Years later, that technology existed in afforable form. The documentary shows how the team of masters combined cels from multiple prints, then colored according to the clues in the 90s discovery. Although I enjoyed the silent feature, I was truly awed by the care and attention to detail involved in recreating the classic from the damaged originals.

5036785,5,B006XEH7EO,"Georges Melies' A Trip to the Moon is without question one of the most imaginative and ahead-of-its-time films ever made. It also stands out as being an incredibly fun film. This is no museum piece.

I was not expecting how revelatory the color restoration would be. This might just be the most incredible restoration job I've ever seen.

The soundtrack is also incredible. Air's new score is unorthodox, sure, but I think perfectly fits the color version. You could almost consider the color and B&W versions to be different films.

Flicker Alley has provided a few terrific extras. Two other Melies films are included in B&W, as well as the B&W version of A Trip to the Moon. The Extraordinary Voyage is an excellent documentary chronicling the life of Georges Melies and the restoration of the film.

Major props to Flicker Alley for providing us with the definitive edition of the crown jewel of early cinema.",1345593600,4,913,4.833333333333333

5036787,5,B006XEH7EO,"Thanks to Martin Scorsese and his movie HUGO, most of the world now knows who Georges Melies is and where that iconic shot of the Man in the Moon with a projectile stuck in his eye came from. Up until now A TRIP TO THE MOON has been available in several different editions of varying quality from pretty good to downright awful. I think it is safe to say that this version from Flicker Alley should be the last word on the subject for where is there left to go? Not only do we get to see the film in a restoration of its hand colored version but there is the best looking black & white version that I have ever seen and I've seen plenty. Although it's nice to have the hand colored version for viewing, I prefer the B&W one which resembles the 19th century illustrations of Gustave Dore'.

In addition to the two 15 minute versions there is a wonderful documentary, THE EXTRAORDINARY VOYAGE that traces the history of the film from its origins in 1902 to the discovery of the hand colored fragment in the 1990s that resulted in this restoration. As with previous Flicker Alley editions, there are numerous extras including two other Melies shorts with an astronomical theme THE ECLIPSE (1904) & THE ASTRONOMER'S DREAM (1898), a choice of musical backgrounds, and a booklet which gives background on Melies and how he made his films. Georges Melies thought A TRIP TO THE MOON to be one of his lesser works but acknowledged its popularity. I'm sure this deluxe set would have surprised and delighted him and he would have found the concept of DVDs not to mention Blu-Ray fascinating.",1340841600,9,1581,4.5473684210526315

That being said, other than the packaging, there is no difference between the two. It still comes with the Blu-ray, DVD, and a 24 page booklet, all packaged within (what many know as) a Criterion Blu-ray case.

Now, about the film itself: absolutely magnificent. After watching both the colour version, and the black-and-white version, I watched the hour long documentary included on the disc. The wealth of information within this feature is overwhelming. You learn about silent films, The history of George Melies, the fall of silent cinema, and the finding and restoration of A Trip to The Moon (my favourite part!), all of it being very informative. Also included are two other shorts by Melies with moon-related stories, an interview with French music duo Air, and three audio options for the black-and-white version of the film.

A Trip to The Moon is one of the best Blu-ray packages you can spend your money on, it's worthy of a spot in any film-lovers collection.",1339977600,40,1587,5.545454545454546

The soundtrack by AIR was not as bad as I had feared after reading some of the reviews and previewing the soundtrack cd. (Thankfully, much of the most dreadful music on the cd is not in the film.) However, I agree wholeheartedly that it was a terrible mistake to make the AIR soundtrack the only option. I consider this to be a very important release, and feel its integrity has been seriously damaged by this baffling decision on the part of Flicker Alley. I also do not like the Blu-ray/DVD combo format. I think that most people, like me, will only watch the Blu-ray disc, unless they have no Blu-ray player, in which case they will only watch the DVD. This makes the extra disc useful as a drinks coaster or mini frisbee, but little else. They could easily have made the second disc a 'Best Of Melies In Color' compilation or perhaps a sampling of contemporary films to provide a historical perspective. But these issues aside, I am very happy with my purchase and it definately will go on my shelf with other discs which will never go on ebay, even if I am reduced to living on rice and beans.

P.S.
 If you cannot afford the 30 to 40 dollars price, you can get a dvd version as a bonus disc to the AIR soundtrack cd for around 15 dollars. Then you can use the dreadful cd for your drinks coaster.",1335139200,5,1407,4.407692307692308

There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.

For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search ""melies flicker alley"" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too.

5036793,5,B006XEH7EO,"I just got back from a screening at the American Film Institute of the restored ""Trip to the Moon"" plus "" The Extraordinary Voyage"" documentary and after reading the reviews on Amazon I thought I'd put my 2 cents in. There seems to be a lot of griping about the Air score. First let me say that I am a fan of Air's music, but I am an even bigger fan of Mlis films. I do agree that the entire score, which I heard one month ago on CD, is some of Air's lesser music. However I still enjoyed it especially when taking into account that the album-length score was designed to be trimmed down to fit the 14 minute movie. And after seeing how the music was utilized for the film I can say that, for me, it did work and made me appreciate the soundtrack CD even more. The music (not ""rock-n-roll"" but Electronica, as was already corrected by someone else here) does give the movie a dreamlike and more modern feel. And in fact Air was probably chosen to score the film to attract a younger audience. Having said all of that, I can also understand why some might prefer a more traditional orchestra or piano score. And while I do agree that having the option to choose between a different soundtrack on the restored color version would indeed have been the best thing even for an Air fan such as myself, I find it hard to believe that not having that option would knock a rating of this restored release down even 1 star. After watching the documentary, which was screened tonight before the movie itself, it was absolutely incredible to me to see exactly how much work was put into rescuing this version of ""Trip to the Moon""! Words like ""miraculous"" and ""mind-blowing"" are appropriate here that this Blu-Ray even exists! Not to mention how lucky we are in these times that teams of people would and did go through so much trouble to rescue what was essentially a chunk of solid plastic (as the discovered reel of film had solidified) and restore it into this historical work of art. And so, while I respect that everyone has their opinions and critiques, and while I even understand why some might be put-off by the new music, I myself can't help but feel amazed that some folks are complaining about this release to the degree that they are and not recognizing the magnificence of it to the degree that it is. Perhaps some people are spoiled by the digital technology of our times or maybe seek to exaggerate so-called ""flaws"" just to have something to whine about. I have no idea, but in this case it seems unnecessary to blow things out of proportion the way a few folks are doing. In short: You guys should just chill out on the Air thing! Hell, turn the sound off if you have to! It is a ""silent"" movie after all! I mean... it's ""Trip to the Moon""! It's restored and longer then it's probably been since 1902! And IT'S IN COLOR!!

5036794,5,B006XEH7EO,"As have many of you, I've seen photos of the man in the moon with the projectile in his eye for years. I had not really thought about this movie until I recently saw Hugo which I found to be an entrancing film about a young boy and his life in a train station. The character Georges Melies is introduced as the proprietor of a toy shop in the train station; a situation which parallels the real life of Melies. Flashbacks show him as he started out on his film making career and generated an interest in learning more about this man. The production of Hugo involved the recreation of Melies' studio in Montreuil's Garden and gives the viewer some helpful insights into the world and life of Melies.

As a dedicated science fiction fan it was easy for me to relate to his enthusiasm for a trip to the moon; as a young boy I too read Jules Verne's' 1865 novel, ""From the Earth to the Moon"" which served in part as Melies' inspiration for making the movie. I am not a film buff and I don't specialize in old films or have a strong enthusiasm for their restoration; I am, however, grateful that there are some people who care and are taking extraordinary steps to preserve the older films.

There is an interesting and rather lengthy documentary about the original circumstances surrounding the production of the original movie and the much later steps required to restore it. This was definitely a labor of love and movie fans owe a debt of gratitude to the dedication and determination of all those involved in this effort. At the time the restoration was begun the technology did not yet exist to complete the process as required; the digital files had to wait several years before technology finally provided the needed tools.

Included in this version is a very informative 23 page booklet, all in English, that provides additional pictures and information regarding the man and his movie.

I am really thankful that I saw Hugo first; it prepared me for this excellent rendition of ""A Trip to the Moon"" and in a way helped me understand and appreciate Melies' vision. I recommend this movie to all who have an interest in science fiction and those who have an interest in the efforts of the early pioneers in movie making.",1334275200,8,2223,4.577889447236181
5036795,5,B006XEH7EO,"Movies owe what they are to Georges Melies. There were other early movie pioneers to be sure, but they lacked the extent of Melies' theatrical sense and uncanny technical expertise. He was the one who tapped into this new art form's potential to realize anything imaginable.

The film that still stands as a metaphor for movie making magic is A TRIP TO THE MOON, produced by Melies in 1902. Available for decades only in black and white, a hand colored orginal print of this iconic film was found in 1993 in Spain, and an unprecedented restoration project was proposed. The badly damaged nitrate fragments had to wait many years to repair, since work only progressed as new software became available. The results of this remarkable reconstruction can now be seen in a beautiful, Blu-ray/DVD limited edition steelbook case from Flicker Alley. After 110 years, the unique whimsicality of A TRIP TO THE MOON is renewed in an array of vibrant colors.

The original music score by the French band, AIR, actually adds to the surrealism of Melies' film. The very nature of silent films leaves them open to various musical interpretations. That said, AIR's composition doesn't detract from TRIP, but simply evokes its essence via a contemporary sound, thus proving what a timeless film it truly is. The b&w version, at 12 minutes, has 3 optional audio tracks; the color version is about 3 minutes longer and doesn't offer this feature.

A fascinating documentary, THE EXTRAORDINARY VOYAGE, covers Melies' career and A TRIP TO THE MOON's miraculous rebirth to new, colorful life. Included also are two moon-related Melies films, THE ECLIPSE (1904) and THE ASTRONOMER'S DREAM (1898).

It's amazing that this work from cinema's dawn retains all of its ability to enchant us despite the cascade of sci-fi and fantasy films it spawned. Definitely most highly recommended.",1333843200,,1858,5.042345276872964

**** = discs

FIRST LET ME SAY THIS INCLUDES BOTH A BLU-RAY DISC AND A DVD. You do not need a Blu-ray player to buy this. The packaging makes it hard to get the DVD out without scratching it, it is tucked behind the Blu-ray disc.

What more could be said about this great classic fantasy film? The praises are many. Now we can finally see it in color, just as it was hand-colored by the artists at the Melies Studio.

However the disc presentation falls a little short.  I hated paying so much for a 15 minute film, yes you do get an hour long documentary about Georges Melies as well as a B&W version of the film and two other Melies shorts bringing the program over the 90 minute mark. I just wish this had been combined with Flicker Alley's Melies Encore DVD release.

Another issue is that the multiple audio options including a reading of narration written by Georges Melies (currently missing on the Blu-ray disc) is available ONLY on the B&W version. The color version gives you no audio options, you HAVE to listen to a new composition that sounds something like what the 1970's experimental rock group Pink Floyd would do.  Now if I want to see this as Georges Melies intended, in color, I would also like to hear the words he wrote!  I don't dislike the new composition, i just want to hear Georges' words.

The restoration still shows the age of the film and is far from perfect, but it is over 100 years old and we are lucky to have it. However, a little work with image stabilization programs and flicker reduction would have improved the film without taking anything away from the original artwork.

Flicker Alley is offering replacement Blu-ray discs if you visit their website. These will correct the missing narration on the B&W version of the movie. These new discs have not yet been manufactured as of 4/5/12 but they will put you on a waiting list for the corrected Blu-ray disc.  There is a comment section on the form where I requested they make all audio options available for the color version.

5036797,5,B006XEH7EO,"I love art and film, especially French films, and my first experience with a Flicker Alley title was ""Henri-Georges Clouzot's Inferno,"" which I highly recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henri-Georges-Clouzot-s-Inferno-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B004NAZ7QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henri-Georges Clouzot's Inferno (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>

I haven't had much experience with silent films, but then I saw ""Hugo"" (3 times) this past winter and it really piqued my interest.  I had never seen any version of ""A Trip to the Moon"" until now, and I'm very glad I bought this collection.

Steel Case Package:  This is a really nice touch and totally appropriate for a film of this nature.  It's the exact same size as a regular plastic BluRay DVD package but like a Steampunk version.  There's an info card taped to the back of it that I peeled off and slipped inside the front cover where you'll find a booklet with an abridged essay on the history of ""A Trip to the Moon.""

The Color Version:  WOW!  Just WOW!  I can't believe this was made 110 years ago and we're seeing it today in this condition.  I love the saturated colors of the tints, the sets, the costumes, and marvel at the foresight and imagination of Melies.  Music is NOT my forte, but I found the AIR soundtrack to be a fresh and modern interpretation.  It's ethereal and a bit haunting in some segments and whimsical in others.  It really worked for me.

The B&W Version:  I watched this with the Robert Israel soundtrack and it's stereotypically what I would expect to accompany a silent film (read: dull and old-fashioned).  What I liked about the B&W is that it lets you appreciate the finer details of the images without the distractions of the colors.  Imagine watching an animated ink engraving and you get the idea.

The Extraordinary Voyage Documentary:  The same people that made the Inferno documentary I referenced above made this one and it's FASCINATING!  It's over an hour long and covers the early history of cinema around Melies' time, includes many additional clips, and describes how that painstaking hand tinting was done.  The last half covers the restoration of the color print.  Geek heaven!

Like I said, I'm a newbie to silents and film restoration, so this might be old hat to a lot of people, but it was totally informative and entertaining for me.  I'm really happy to own this piece of history.",1333065600,6,2446,5.131645569620253
5036798,5,B006XEH7EO,"The silent film community owes Flicker Alley a standing ovation for giving this wonderful restoration the Four-Star release it deserves.  What an incredibly rich set of extras!  I pre-ordered and received one of the first copies shipped and just finished making my way through the second disc.  Amazing!  Well, actually, I despise the Air soundtrack, but aside from that, I repeat, the Blu-Ray transfer is AMAZING.  ...and the good news that there are so many alternate tracks that Air is easily avoided.

As has been noted in a couple of reviews, there was a technical glitch in the first batch that was shipped, but Flicker Alley is on the job and today they proactively emailed and provided instructions for requesting a corrected replacement disc.  If you also happen to have an early copy, check the Flicker Alley web site for info on replacement.

Thanks Flicker Alley.  You've done it again!",1332979200,7,898,4.933333333333334
5036799,3,B006XEH7EO,"GREAT:
Blu-ray is EXACTLY what these ancient films need!  Particularly due to Melies' continuous use of extreme long-shots, where detail is easily lost, it is awe-inspiring to FINALLY see how good Mlis' filmstock really was, offering crisp, clear, sharp images.  For example, in the Loading The Gun scene on the rooftops, you can actually see the cheeks and cute smile of the little French girl farthest in the back at the top left.  And when Micromegas (the one who falls in the tub of nitric acid) flashes one of his frequent smiles, you can see his TEETH!  Curiously, first-generation prints of Mlis movies are not as clear as prints made later from existing negatives.  Apparently in the first ten or twenty years of cinema, they didn't yet know how to make good prints.  However, part of this restoration is a colorizing of a later black-and-white print, so while some of this movie, being from the original first-generation print, is way out of focus (like the astronomers preparing to sleep), other parts (that come from a restored B&W print?), like the rooftop scene, are as sharp and detailed as anything shot today in 35mm.  A pleasure to see!

The restored color movie is self-recommending.  If you have ANY interest in Melies, ""A Trip to the Moon"", movie restoration, or early cinema, then you MUST see this film. Just getting this film alone is worth the cost of the steelcase blu-ray/dvd set. AND you get the documentary about how this all came about. (By the way, it is an EXCELLENT and entertaining documentary on George Melies; it's the best I've seen, and for those interested in cinema history, this steelcase set is probably worth getting just for the documentary.)

Other reviewers can fill you in on the details about this particular film and its controversial sound track; which I actually like, by the way, in spite of a few annoying miscalculations on the part of the composers. (However, see  my last paragraph.) So, rather than belabor all that, I will now go on to the ""bonus"" features:

GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS:
Each soundtrack to every film is enjoyable, although I agree that an alternative should have been provided for the color version.  The black-and-white version of ""Trip..."" has three soundtrack options, and they are all good.  The voice-overs by the improv group are very funny, and a couple of times made me laugh out loud; but they seem to run out of ideas frequently, and there are long stretches without any voices at all.  I actually wish they had kept up a patter all the way through.

Even better, the Robert Israel music-with-narration to the B&W version of ""Trip to the Moon"" is brilliant.

This is perfect on the recently-corrected blu-ray.  However, on the DVD version with the narration, the sound IS A GOOD SECOND-AND-A-HALF AHEAD OF THE PICTURE.  I find this incredibly annoying, as it creates an odd effect when the gun is fired and when the moon gets hit in the face.  On BOTH blu-ray and dvd versions, the sound is late to the image on the movie ""The Astronomer's Dream"".  This is a shame because the music is expertly composed to fit the action; you probably won't notice it being off, but I re-synced it and I found that when the music exactly matches the picture, many effects come across strikingly, but are way diminished with the sound being a tad late.  For instance, the sudden appearance of The Devil almost makes you jump when the music is spot-on.  Without being in sync it just looks ... eh...

Even worse, you can see ALL of Melies's junkie construction-paper backgroungs in the ""Eclipse"" movie. You can see exactly how he is sliding around his characters ""in space"", COMPLETELY destroying all magical illusion, which Melies would have hated.  Just a little tweaking with the darks and the contrast fixes this, and should have been done before distributing it.  As it is, before showing this to anyone, you will have to go through the movie and make adjustments to your monitor so your friends don't find the film tacky and stupid-looking.  Also, the two short films are not offered from high-definition scans.  They have been taken from a low-definition digital reproduction and are simply presented on blu-ray.  So now you can more clearly see the edges of the pixels...

Now wouldn't you think that given this very, very, very special, heralded and limited edition that Flicker Alley would have SOMEONE doing ""quality assurance""?  I mean don't they have someone who watches the film on the b-r/dvd before they make thousands of copies and sell them?  Inconceivably, apparently not...

The B&W version of ""Trip"" comes ""from a fine-grain master derived from a nitrate print made available by the Mlis family.""  This is sharp and clear, but not clean: it has had little restoration and is full of speckles, flash-frames and splices.  It is also beset with jitter and weave, making it a very difficult viewing experience.  They could have stabilized the image without any reduction in detail, and this is proved by watching the documentary.  In the documentary there is a section from ""Moon..."" and it is rock solid, yet with crystal sharp details.  The image of this movie on the ""Georges Melies: First Wizard of Cinema"" dvd collection is cleaner and has little noticeable jitter.  However the focus is not as detailed.  (Just as a matter of interest: for the best ever reproduction of the film in black-and-white, EXTREMELY well-restored actually, with NO noticeable jitter-and-weave, go to Amazon.fr and search that site for """"A la conquete du cinematographe"".  This will give you a 3-DVD set of Melies films (mostly of poorer quality than the Wizard set but with a few exceptions, and with some films not on any other set), with a book of beautiful photos (all the text is in French, however) by ""STUDIOCANAL"".  Unfortunately, it also uses a musical accompaniment for ""Trip to the Moon"" that is a just-barely acceptable piano score.)

So, one star for Flicker Alley's poor quality assurance and inadequate  presentation of the black-and-white films and for not giving us true high-definition with the shorts.  Four-and-a-half stars for their presentation of the color version.  Out of 5 stars, I give Melies 10 stars for the movie itself, and Technicolor 99 stars for putting together the fragmented pieces of the color print. (I took away 1 star because there is still a about two weeks' worth of easy if time-consuming digital work that could have been done to improve the film in its current ""final"" version, mostly to stabilize the images.)

A FINAL THOUGHT:
This restoration has been ecstatically acclaimed by many; however, I find some of it very difficult to watch, especially the first two and penultimate scenes, because of the extreme jitter, and brutal changes in lighting, color, contrast and overall quality from frame-to-frame.  I am very interested to hear from those of you who actually buy this product and watch this film: when you watch it do you, as I do, find yourself ""white-knuckling"" the arms of your chair, unconsciously preparing for when the film will break?  Or do you just find this restoration beautiful and miraculous?  Or...???  I know we all owe the teams who restored this film a tremendous round of applause for bringing this movie back to life...  AND considering the money and effort put into this project, and how few people are interested in such things, I think $30+ is completely reasonable.  I would have paid twice that amount.  But I remain under the impression that the best compromise would have been to dump the worst sections of the color print they were trying to restore (that is, long sections of it), and instead replace it with restored and colorized versions of the best available black-and-white prints.  As a matter of fact, this is exactly what the Technicolor people did do in short segments when the color print was just too severely damaged to repair, and their work is gorgeous.  But what are your thoughts?  And what about the other films on the dvd?  Does it actually NOT bother you when sound is out of sync with the movie?  Do you not care that the prints are so poorly presented that you see all those background seams and wrinkles, platforms, ramps, wheels and wires?  Or am I the only one so insanely passionate about early cinema that I hope beyond hope that someone (Scorsese?) will bring together a team to truly restore Melies' films back to their original and, to whatever extent possible, pristine glory (as he did for snippets in ""Hugo""), and remain unsatisfied until someone does?",1332806400,35,8528,4.848756906077348
5036800,4,B006XEH7EO,"I was very excited to find this in my mail box when I got home today, and in minutes was watching it. The color and shading sometimes vary a lot from frame to frame, but it didn't detract from the impact the film has. Also, the image is well stabilized.

It was amazing to watch this. I had seen black an white clips from it before, and got a glimpse of this restoration when I saw ""Hugo.""

I took a star away because one of the three soundtrack options for the black and white version is not as listed. The first option is listed on the menu as an orchestral score with the original English narration written by Melies. However, I did not hear a word of narration in 3 viewings, just the orchestral score. This shortcoming may not be of concern to some, but in this Special Edition, I feel it should be there. The black and white version does not appear to have undergone much restoration as the image is not stabilized and scratches and such are readily apparent.

The information card on the back of the case stated there were two soundtrack options for the black and white presentation, one being with narration. Also the card was attached to the back of the case with double-sided tape instead of the usual much easier to remove clear gummy plastic. I haven't yet removed this tape from the attractive steel case to avoid scratching it.

Today we watched the restored, colorized version of A Trip to the Moon from 1902 (but the restored, colorized version from 2011 with music by AIR!). One of the first feature films ever made with a storyline and an extensive cast, it tells the story (a story!) of a trip to the moon, with conflict! intrigue! suspense! action! comedy! Everything a film needs. A revolution at fourteen minutes, Schneiders book suggests that this is the first chance a film had to present a purely cinematic fictional fantasy constructed for pure entertainment, opening a door to the future of film as a grand escapist platform.

Jennifer

This film instantly reminded me of the Smashing Pumpkins album  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (and the Tonight Tonight video.  Go ahead, watch it again.  I just did).  A Trip to the Moon is filmed more like a play with several acts, with each scene unfolding with the familiar directions and staging of a something from the theater.  The colors are almost garish or obscene in their brightness and boldness- but this just adds to the appeal.  I was struck most by what a delightful and imaginative story this is, from the sets, to the costumes, to the magical powers of umbrella.  I would love to know what someone watching over a hundred years ago was thinking after a first view.

Garrett

I thought this was a charming little film  mainly for its connections to the Tonight Tonight video that Jennifer mentioned. We couldn't stop talking about it, along with the documentary we watched about Wayne White called Beauty is Embarassing, an incredible film where White discussed his work with puppetry, MTV/Smashing Pumpkins, Pee Wees Playhouse, and other great art projects.

This film is pretty revolutionary in a lot of ways. As I watched I couldn't escape what I think of when I think early filmall of which don't have a plot, and are just short snippets of something happening. Like The Horse and The Kiss. I also thought of the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret which romanticizes the fictional genesis of this film along with the Paris film industry. Interestingly, I also saw the movie which was somethingdifferent.

This was a gorgeous film in its use of stop-film tricks, weird theatrical cardboard sets that at times were two dimensional and at times three dimensional, beautiful and complex costumes and makeup, and some really impressive special effects. A pleasure to watch in its new colorized incantation that added a somewhat extra level of magic to the film. Furthermore, having been scored by one of my favorite bands, AIR, it was a joy to experience. Audiences at the time must have been astonished!",1456012800,2,2697,4.832608695652174
