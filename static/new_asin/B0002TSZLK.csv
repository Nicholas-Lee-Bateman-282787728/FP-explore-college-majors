8031732,5,B0002TSZLK,My grandson loves sea creatures and has watched this several times.,1411603200,,67,5.181818181818182
8031733,5,B0002TSZLK,My 5 year old loves nature and wanted to learn about sea animals. She loves this video and will watch it all day if you let her.,1361750400,,128,3.7777777777777777
8031734,4,B0002TSZLK,"My kids love these, and they are younger than the target audience. My biggest complaint about this one stems from the cover being a picture of a shark, yet the DVD itself has very little actual video of sharks at all. My 3 year old kept saying ""I want to watch the shark one"", yet there was no real ""Shark"" selection to choose. But generally such a better option for children who want to see actual footage of real things, as opposed to cartoon. The children who host are also friendly.",1205020800,5,486,4.351648351648351
8031735,5,B0002TSZLK,"This video is a great educational program for kids. Our 4 year old loves this series - the ocean one in particular.  Ths short segments are good for younger kids, but the overall show teaches a lot about any given subject. I'd guess this was good for kids up to about 9 or so.  The behind the scenes look at aquariums are very interesting. Overall, a wonderful addition to a video library!",1176595200,7,389,4.388888888888889
8031736,4,B0002TSZLK,"This is a good show for kids, it's very informative and the young presenters do a good job making this show interesting and fun. There are many interesting topics which are explored but I do have one complaint which is that each episode is a bit short. Great if you have kids who are younger but the older ones may find this less informative as the topics covered are not explored in much detail. But on the whole, it's still a fun way to learn about stuff!",1128556800,9,457,4.264367816091954
