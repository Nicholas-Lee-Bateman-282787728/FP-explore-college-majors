7240088,5,B00YSBFPSY,"Am a follower of the TV series on CW, so the DVD lets me watch it again whenever I want. Really like the series - I enjoy historical pieces, the romance and intrigue, and the costumes for Reign are excellent.",1444262400,4,208,4.225
7240089,4,B00YSBFPSY,"Reign: The Complete Second Season begins with Mary and Francis on the throne of a nation in crisis. France is rocked by the after-effects of the Black Plague, a disease that has crept inside the castle walls, taking thousands upon thousands of lives across the land, ravaging the stability of a country. From the ashes, powerful lords rise to carry out personal, religious, and political vendettas, taking lives and tearing at Mary and Francis commitment to each other and their people. Friendships are tested, loved ones murdered and betrayed. Meanwhile, a mysterious and deadly threat snatches victims from village streets and castle corridors, leaving evidence of savagery that looks like the work of monsters  mythical creatures who are the subject of nightmares but who walk among us doing the Devils bidding.

Reign is not afraid of launching several subplots in its first episode of the season, The Plague. Production values are still a major appeal of this medieval soap opera. Taking a cue from Game of Thrones, the writers have incorporated many characters, all with their own self-serving motives and capable of doing whatever it takes to achieve them. Mary has learned from past events and now knows she wants to reign with fairness and respect. She also wants to earn the respect of the nobility. When this doesnt work out, she knows how to take matters into her own hands.

Bonus extras on the 5-disc DVD set include deleted scenes and the behind-the-scenes making-of featurette, Playing By Her Rules: A Day on Set With a Queen and Her Court.",1443916800,,1556,4.976923076923077
7240090,3,B00YSBFPSY,"This season takes a rather unfortunate creative dip.

Historical inaccuracies aside, the show suffered from subplots that dragged through multiple episodes (this is in reference to the infamous episode many boycotted after being aired) with uninspired dialogue. The new love triangle the writers made use of in the later episodes of the season started interesting enough, but became an annoyance as time went on. The writers did to Mary what THE VAMPIRE DIARIES did to Elena: they made their leading lady almost insufferable and also one of the least interesting.

While the season started slow, picked up, dragged, had some fun upticks...and then made a very quick fast forward in its final 2 episodes, the finale definitely seemed to get things back on track. The focus seems to be on their role as rulers  agin...and not basic love affairs. The final few episodes brought me back on board for season 3.

A step down from season 1, but not enough to drop the show without another thought.",1442620800,5,990,4.910179640718563
7240091,5,B00YSBFPSY,"Reign season 1,2 were the best of the series. Season 3 still beautiful and unique series, but yes part was when Toby was written off. The other part it just turned into a whole different series.
When it shows the stars of the series Adelaide Kane, Megan and puts supporting cast Toby Regbo and Torrance coombs etc.. It should said Toby Regbo, Adelaide Kane, Torrance and Megan.",1439769600,2,377,4.641791044776119
7240092,5,B00YSBFPSY,I absolutely love this series. I think season two was even better than one. i definitely recommend it. So much better than all the trash on TV these days.,1438473600,11,154,4.344827586206897
7240093,5,B00YSBFPSY,"This was a bold season.  They took a lot of chances that paid off.  Mary fell off her pedestal and proved to be as human after all.  Kenna reverted to gold-digging type and faced the consequences.  Greer lost everything but found her independence.  Francis stumbled as king but proved his love for Mary.  And finally -- finally -- we meet Elizabeth, setting up what could be an amazing season 3.",1438214400,12,395,4.571428571428571
7240094,5,B00YSBFPSY,"I love this show. It has definitely surpassed my expectations. The first season was beautiful, and the second, was just as grand. Of course, I was excited, nervous, happy, teary-eyed, disappointed, entranced, laughed, and etc. but isn't that what a good show does? It consumes you. It allows you to feel as though you are in the show itself. The second season isn't largely like the first, and why would it be? The first season had its drama; it fizzled out, and resolved itself, and now onto another issue, and another season filled with different and just as wonderful drama. It's an awesome show - you certainly won't be disappointed; but obviously you need to begin with the first season. I hope there are more after the third, and more even after that. It's that wonderful. Some might not see it as great, but maybe it's just because the season/show hasn't turned out like they think/hoped it would. It's a show. It won't make you happy/excited 100% of the time.",1436832000,13,967,4.694117647058824
7240095,1,B00YSBFPSY,"This season was horrible. It took everything that was amazing about the first season and ripped it to shreds. The beginning of this season started out very well. Even the obstacles that were presented were solid. As the series progressed however, it became one big mess. Did it create drama and screaming, crying fangirls? Sure. But when we watch we expect more than drama, we expect good writing. The drama has to be resolved at some point, and that is expected to be written well. This wasn't. It was rushed and it didn't make sense. There were alot of unnecessaries in this season, both on the large and small scale. It had its moments but it took a turn for the worst after the mid-season finale and never improved from then on. While there was some intrigue and satisfaction to the season finale, it could only be appreciated if you ignored the whole second half of the season and created your own show in your head. Reign was a FANTASTIC show in its first season. I don't know how the third season will go, but I hope it's the last. From what I've heard, it will be just as awful as this one. The ONLY reason you should invest any time in the second season would be for idle curiosity or because you want a teen, royal soap opera. And for the pretty actors. They really are very good, despite the awful scripts they've been given. I can't wait for the show to end and for them to pursue other projects, because I hate not wanting to watch them because the show has gone so sour. For those who embark on this season, maybe it works for you, maybe it doesn't, but with my opinion in hand...you have been warned. This season may royally fall short of even the lowest expectations.",1435622400,22,1683,4.414790996784566

7240132,5,B00YSBFPSY,Best series Ever! From season 1 to 3 every episode is incredible. Why this show has not won every award available is mind boggling. I have watched every episode over and over.,1501200000,,175,4.5
7240133,4,B00YSBFPSY,"This is a period drama about Mary, Queen of Scots with little sense of time, place, or history, as it is all pretty much wildly inaccurate. It is like watching a modern day teen drama set in a medieval time. The dialogue is peppered with modern day phrases, the social mores of today seem to permeate, and the costumes, though quite beautiful, bear little resemblance to what was actually worn by ladies at court back then, and the jewelry worn looks like something purchased at Chico's.

Still, if one disregards all this, there is something compelling about this drama. There is loads of intrigue and plot machinations. The cast is attractive and reasonably talented. If season one resembled a medieval Beverly Hills 90210, season two is more reminiscent of a medieval Dynasty. I found myself binge watching season 2 and looking forward to season three.",1499212800,,855,4.896551724137931

7240259,3,B00YSBFPSY,Takes a lot of liberties with  history.  More for the younger set than those who like historically accurate films.  but it hold attention.  Best acting is done by the King and his mother.  Queen Mary and her ladies in waiting suck.  The costuming is awful.

7240499,2,B00YSBFPSY,"I am enjoying this series immensely, but it is ridiculously fantastical.  The overwrought histrionics make for good soap-operatic entertainment -- but truly, Mary, Queen of Scots was married to Francis for such a brief time, the intrigues, plots, and deceptions that carry this series (especially Season 2) are just largely fiction.  Sebastian (""Bash""), Henry's illegitimate son and Francis's half-brother, is completely fabricated.  The names of Queen Mary's ladies-in-waiting -- Kenna?  GREER?!  ***LOLA*** (!!!!!) -- are so poorly chosen for the time period -- all of the Scots queen's handmaids were named Mary as well, so I appreciate the series assigning new monikers, but please -- no Scotswoman of that era would have ever sported such names as these.

I am particularly happy seeing Megan Follows playing the domineering, manipulative French  queen mother  -- she is a delight to observe in the role.  If anything, I would like to see a series based on the Valois ruling family -- Queen Catherine de Medicis and her daughter, Margaret (yet unseen in ""Reign""), had a historically volatile and highly impactful relationship that would translate beautifully into a drama series.  Preferably accurate to history, of course.",1448236800,13,1228,5.348958333333333

It's definitely a chick series, but I think the acting is quite good and some of the costumes are gorgeous (although most are again not accurate historically).  The sets are superb, especially the castle scenes (a 14th century Irish castle is used for the outside and some inside scenes).

7240553,2,B00YSBFPSY,"Season 2.. I had hoped that the issues of stretching the historical record would be resolved.  Yet the writing for the younger main cast seems to be off.  Secret meetings in during a dance, conversations between key characters so open, there are no chances to see everything, but Mary's almost impetuous temperament during every show.  She is outraged during the plague, she outraged that there is intolerance between Catholic and Protestant, she is outraged at every situation.  The fictional King, Francis - because you look in history, the boy never grew to this age - seems to have to bounce around from character to character and situation from situation.

So where did we see a glimmer.  First of all, as always, Craig Parker in the show as Narcisse.  Its refreshing and he brings life to it.  Secondly, Megan Follows as Catherine de Medici.  She seems to dominate every scene she is in.  Her sparring and backhanded comments change this mundane romp from a post-teenage Tudor wanna be show to something enjoyable to watch.  Match Catherine with Narcisse together and you get electricity.

Some points of interest - the costumes are lavish and present a good aspect to the show.  The scenery is rich and does successfully transport the viewer to somewhere else.  The soundtrack - outside of the pop songs OK.  The pop songs are ludicrous - and even more insulting in a later part of the show the dance in the background seems to be a minuet to Chandelier.  Come on.  Mary and her wanting to be some force for the 21st century seems to forget this is just a bit historical.  Maybe she was naive about the effect of religious conflicts in France, but by the time she was in Scotland that went away.  One note, a lot of issues between Mary and Elizabeth resolved around religious strife.

So the show - is it worth a season 3?  Maybe, but I fear that Elizabeth may be portrayed as a menacing ""evil queen"".  I have hope - though not much.  The other factor - this is now been listed as a Historical Fantasy - that label is more appropriate.",1445212800,5,2042,4.611111111111111
7240554,1,B00YSBFPSY,"Reign continues to be a ridiculous, ahistorical, angst-ridden soap opera. In addition to the costumes straight off the beauty-pageant stage, the use of random, possibly mystical elements in this show makes no sense. If you're going to have a world in which prophecy, magic, and weird cults are real, then everyone should know about it, not just the occasional ""pagan.""",1444867200,,368,5.15

Reign (2013-2017) is a silly, talky, dumb version of a castle and royalty show. The scenery, locations, and costumes are beautiful, but the characters, dialog, and situations are stupid. Reign joins the ranks of other inferior castle and royalty shows such as Camelot (2011), The White Queen (2013), and World Without End (2012). If you want to read some of the many things I didn't like about Reign skip down a few paragraphs past my recommendations of better shows to watch instead of wasting your time with Reign.

If you want to see a good castle and royalty show watch Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The Last Kingdom (2015- ), Merlin (2008-2012), Pillars of the Earth (2010), The 10th Kingdom (2000), The Tudors (2007-2010), or the Vikings (2013- ).

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), and Taken (2002), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

Reign began as a show about Mary, Queen of Scots. By the last season it had morphed into a show mostly not about Mary, into a show about the French Court and Queen Elizabeth of England. Meanwhile Mary was forgotten in Scotland. The last scene in the final episode of this mess is a mashup of parts of scenes from earlier seasons in the show, as if to remind viewers, Hey, remember when this was a show about Mary?

Reign started off with an obnoxious drumbeat, which constantly thumped in the first episode, which thankfully was toned down in the second episode and eventually went away, otherwise I wouldnt have been able to watch the whole series. The series started as a sort of a silly fashion show/music video thing, then turned into a somber show with numerous scenes of Mary crying and making silly pronouncements, during the scenes that were actually about Mary. Like some other four season series such as Farscape (1999-2003) and Enterprise (2001-2005) the first two seasons of Reign were better than the last two seasons.

I liked the character Megan Follows played in Anne of Green Gables (1985), but I didn't like the despicable character she played in Reign. When Mary isn't throwing the scheming, treacherous character Follows plays into the dungeon they're hugging. Its ridiculous.

One of the many things about Reign that annoyed me was the formulaic, repetitive scene structure. The scenes were so predictable the show became boring. Heres an example of a typical scene: Two characters talk. Background music begins playing. One of the characters talks faster as the music swells into a crescendo and then the character delivers a declarative statement in a loud voice as the music reaches a climax, then flash cut to black. There are literally dozens of these repetitive scene structures in a single episode, which means there can be hundreds of them in a single season. The scenes were so predictable they put me to sleep. Slight variations of these repetitious scenes have one of the characters suddenly kiss the other character or start ripping their clothes off as the music swells to a climax, then flash cut to black.

Its hard to like moronic characters. In the first episode Mary sees a girl die after eating food meant to assassinate her, Mary, Queen of Scots. Later Mary survives another attempt to poison her at the castle. Then Mary is raped. Does Mary learn? No. She constantly courts danger by forever wandering around the castle alone, into the estates, and the woods by herself, and goes sailing all by her lonesome, without guards or a single servant as an escort, so that assassins and rapists have constant access to her. She doesnt learn. She doesnt change. Shes a moron.

Mary, Queen of Scots, is the character viewers are supposed to care about, at least at the beginning of the series. I don't know what character the viewer was supposed to care about in the fourth and final season. After Bash (Sebastian) disappeared in the beginning of the final season I didn't care about any of the remaining characters, including Mary.",1522627200,3,5221,5.087616822429907
