443004,3,6302247829,"Pin (short for Pinocchio) is an anatomical instruction dummy.  Dad Terry O'Quinn uses the dummy to explain difficult questions to children Leon and Ursula.  When Dad dies suddenly, Leon projects a personality to Pin to replace him.  Ursula tries to begin a normal life, but Leon says Pin won't allow her to ruin her life by running off with boys.  That plus a bunch of creepy set pieces is the story of Pin.
Leon's attempts to make Pin human are pretty creepy.  The crux of the story is just how far Leon will go in order to make Pin a human.  It's not wishing on a star, I can tell you that.  This may all sound like a Chucky movie or a bad Tales From the Crypt episode, but Pin is eons ahead of them in terms of atmosphere.  There are sometimes long, slow shots of the dummy where you swear you could see him move.  Pretty eerie.
The DVD has an audio commentary by the director.  The movie is now available in widescreen format for the first time so that is a plus.

443005,2,6302247829,"This movie was nothing like I expected.  I don't know exactly what I was expecting.... but whatever it was ... it wasn't what I got.  The cover of the movie is quite deceptive.  On the back of the movie when they say that pin is a harmless deaf mute ... I still kind of thought he was alive or something, but he is just a dummy.  I felt bad for the 2 children in the movie ... anyone living under the conditions in their parents house would probably end up going insane or atleast having some severe emotional or psychological issues.  So throughout the movie it was hard for me to not feel sorry for Leon (I love David Hewlett - CUBE is soooo much better though).  It isn't Leon's fault that his mom was an obsessive compulsive cleaning freak and his dad was a weird and strict, uncaring person.  So what if that leads him to believe that his fathers medical dummy is his friend?  Pin was much nicer than his parents.  So I can't really blame him.  A child who has to live under those conditions is bound to have some kind of way to cope with all that is going on.  Pin was there to help him.  Perhaps there could have been better ways to help Leon than to convince him to kill people (although I cannot place the blame on poor Pin... he is just an innocent by-stander ... especially in the scene where the nurse does bad things to him!!  Naughty naughty!) but the idea of Pin being real was all in Leon's head... I really wish someone had gotten him help... especially his sister who seemed very oblivious to what was going on and when she finally did figure out that Leon was mental ... she just went on with her little life and didn't bother to get him some treatment.  All in all, I've seen better movies, of course.  But I've also seen much worse.",1009152000,,1753,4.2379518072289155
443006,3,6302247829,"I love psychologically scary movies, and had read so many great things about this movie.  It's definately not something I plan on watching again any time soon.  It starts off very well, showing a family ruled by anti-germ freaks mom and pap, as well as their smart and well-mannered son and daughter.  The son starts to believe that his dad's teaching aid dummy is alive, and spirals into an obsession with this doll after his mom and dad are killed in a car wreck.  The storyline sounds great, and the acting is very good, but something just doesn't seem to work.  I've never seen this movie to rent, so you might have to buy it in order to watch it.  If you're looking for a good Psycho - rip off, rent/buy Santa Sangre or Dressed to Kill instead of this unenjoyable flick.",995500800,8,775,4.422535211267606

It is NOT the run of the mill horror flick like ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". ""Pin"" keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering where each vital scene is going to lead you next! It has a ""Hitchcock"" subtleness about it.  If you are a horror fan of the ""TRUE"" sense, and not out for ""blood and guts"" this is YOUR kind of movie!

443065,5,6302247829,"Probably one of the best psychological horror films I have ever seen! I know I am going to seem like I am exaggerating, but this is up there with Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'! The film was superbly directed and the score was superb. Fine acting by Hewlett and Preston.

This is the type of film that gets under your skin, and frightens you more than any ""horror porn"" that gets spit out by Hollywood on massive levels, because this film is real. It's villain is just human being which makes it so much more terrifying and tragic because we watch this so called villain grow up and understand why he is the way he is, and then we realize his eventual fate.

A brilliant film, I recommend this to all. But I'm sad to see that the manufacturer discontinued this release.  It's a must for any horror fan.  If 'Flowers in the Attic' can get a recent re-release then this should as well, hopefully on Blu Ray for both, with new transfers, etc.!",1261872000,,937,4.430232558139535

443067,4,6302247829,"Dr. and Mrs. Linden (Terry O'Quinn and Bronwen Mantel) are raising two perfect children. Leon (David Hewlett) and Ursula (Cyndy Preston) are neat, polite and good natured. They are also overprotected, and Leon is painfully nave.

Dr. Linden is a stern yet loving father who often uses a bit of amateur ventriloquism with an anatomical dummy to explain complex or possibly embarrassing medical facts to his young patients. Mrs. Linden is house-proud and high strung. In other words, these are fairly typical, affluent parents doing all they can to bring up their children with decent values.

Sound familiar? Good. Because one of the things that makes this portrait of a nut case interesting is the absence of clichs about how such people are made. If you're like me, you're sick of hearing how badly little Norman/Hannibal/Michael was treated as a child. It makes perfect sense that a vulnerable, odd kid exposed to brutality could turn out to be a monster. But how many films (aside from Serial Mom and Parents) set out to examine the crazy-making aspects of good old American suburbia?

On the surface, Leon is what most parents want their kids to be. He works hard and makes decent grades. He behaves nicely in public. He even dresses well (in suits and cardigans) and keeps his room clean. Oh, and he talks to his father's anatomical dummy, named Pin (short for Pinocchio). Leon asks Pin for advice, and feels they have a very close relationship.

Uh-huh.

This 1988 film contains a few fashion and styling horrors (shoulder pads galore). Otherwise, it is surprisingly good. The camera work is expert. The acting is understated and effective.

The script doesn't rely on a lot of exposition to set up what is--after all--largely inexplicable. How can parents prevent their children from becoming crazies, when so many predilections come from experiences that can't be anticipated? It is the strange combination of Leon's innocence and the way in which key moments in his life involve a seemingly harmless object, that creates his aberrant point of view. Leon merely endows Pin with the wisdom of his father and a tolerance or kindness that both his parents lack.

Leon's sister Ursula tries to understand. But the more time she spends in the real world outside their house, the more she comes to realize that Leon's behavior is bizarre. The tragic consequences of Leon's creepy obsession are unavoidable, but they make sense in a way that horror story arcs seldom do.

443068,5,6302247829,"Leon (David Hewlett) lives with his beautiful sister Ursula (Cynthia Preston) in a house after their mother and father died in an accident. He feels a bit over-protective about his sister as his only friend is a anatomy medical mannequin named Pin (a.k.a. Pinocchio for short) that his father used to teach kids about the human body, Leon thinks Pin is alive as he uses it as a voice sometimes to chat. But when unwanted visitors come like a certain aunt of theirs and of course Ursula's new boyfriend, he wants Pin to take action with his rage and insanity.

A fantastic underrated Canadian psychological horror thriller from writer-director Sandor Stern who wrote the original ""Amityville Horror"". The film co-stars Terry O'Quinn from ""The Stepfather"" as this movie brings viewers into the mind of an insane person in the ""Psycho"" tradition with great direction and excellen acting as it's a disturbing movie with moody atmosphere and of course thrills till the bizarre ending that has to be seen to believed, it's a must see.

This DVD offers great picture and sound with only two extras like trailer and audio commentary.

443070,3,6302247829,"Don't let the cool cover and misleading reviews fool you. This movie is quite bad.

Plot-  An upper-middle class family, all of them, mom & dad, brother and sister are VERY strange. The whole situation is weird- The way they act with eachother. The movie starts off with the kids, ''Leon the brother and Ursula the sister'' when they were little. The father uses an anatomical dummy named ''Pin'' to teach the children about life and sex. He pretends Pin is talking when its just him using ventriloquism but the children actually believe Pin's talking to them. Let me remind you , this dummy isn't scary at all but everyone in the neighborhood and everyone who meets ''Pin'' is scared of it.

One night Leon's parents get into an accident and the sister and brother are now alone with eachother. Leon is now in his late teens and has started talking to Pin and pretending hes a real human. He took over Daddys place. Obviously, it seems schizophrenia runs in the family. Leon talks to Pin nightly, has conversations with him, brings him to the dinner table, etc. The sister sits there and takes Leons crazy actions and strange behavior with Pin and never asserts herself hardly. She seems scared of Leon, which is a joke because the guy is a wimp. I guess his ''mental illness'' scares her. But at the end you wonder why would she be? it turns out she obviously has some demons of her own.

Leon is very over protective of Ursula and theres definitely some incestuous undertones going on in that house. He gets jealous when she starts dating a guy and when the guy comes over he starts reading his ''poetry''. I cant say whats its about on this site, but you can only guess. Hint- its about his sister and some deviant fantasy.

Everyone that comes over or comes in contact with 'Pin' seems terrified of it. Not of Leon, i can see them being a little weirded out by Leon, but not Pin. For example, Leon gives his Aunt a heart attack just by her seeing Pin. When Pin appears she has a heart attack. Give me a break, if you were to see this dummy in real life it would never scare you. It looks like a regular manican from a doctors office.

You can guess what happens at the end, its not that hard to predict. Leon gets so jealous of the girlfriends new boyfriend, what do you think happens?

This really could have been a good movie. The whole story if done well it could have succeeded.. but.. The acting, the plot holes, the very NOT scary dummy, it just didn't work. This movie isn't scary its more of a look at some kind of mental illness but it just didn't convince me. I couldn't take this movie seriously. Was it the mediocre/bad acting? Was it the unscary manican named 'Pin'' or just not a good movie, maybe a mixture.

This movie played out like a soap opera. It was soap opera acting, it didn't even cut it as TV movie of the week material. It had promise but it was done in the wrong way.

I wonder about the reviewers who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars, haven't they ever seen a good movie before? This is 3 at best, just for the concept. Factor in the acting and everything else , 2 and a half stars.

If you're looking for a horror movie, this isn't it. If you're looking for a weird pyschological drama, this is it, but its not a good one. You decide if you want to purchase this after reading this honest review.",1152144000,2,3327,4.342995169082125
443071,5,6302247829,"Anchor Bay did justice to this gem. The DVD is an excellent reproduction. I like ""well done"" horror movies, yet I wouldn't necessarily call this a horror film. The movie delves more into human relationships and feelings, with a psychological twist.

443072,4,6302247829,"Most all of the so-called horror movies made today are just simple, formulatic nonsense that offer only jolts but nothing withstanding. Whatever happened to the genuinely scary like Psycho or The Exorcist? What we're most afraid of is not monsters or faceless madmen, but elements of our own psyche. This film is one not perfect, but it does succeed in striking a chord with those who desire a REAL reason to stay up at night.

David Hewlitt is fantastic as Leon, a schizophrenic boy with an unnatural obsession with medical dummy Pin. The movie doesn't go soft or stereotypical and deserves more attention than the likes of pointless trash like Urban Legends or Valentine. If you wish to be truly mind-...... by a good psychological thriller, you owe it to yourself to see this flick.",1127692800,17,785,4.814814814814815

But the actors do a good job of throwing themselves into it, and Terry O'Quinn (as the father) does a great job (as usual).",1120003200,3,405,4.597222222222222
443114,5,6302247829,"Pin is an anatomically correct, see-through mannequin. His interests include tutoring, chocolates and terrorizing young ladies. Pin speaks with a slow, thin, whispery voice. His educational expertise includes math and sex. He also enjoys listening to incestuous poetry and creeping quietly in the dark. Pin's story is destined to become a cult classic. The strength of this movie lies not in direction, nor necessarily in acting, but in story. Pin is one of the strangest movies you'll watch. Scenes include a skinless mannequin giving a private sex lecture to a young brother and sister, a man giving his daughter an abortion, and a nurse who uses Pin as a sex doll when she thinks no one else is watching. I also highly recommend the movie The Reflecting Skin, which reminds me of Pin in some ways.",1111881600,7,800,4.889705882352941
443115,5,6302247829,"Back in the 80's my brother and I rented every horror video we could. I took a chance on this one because the box looked cool. Well,the video box had some misleading info on it making this look like a ripping horror thriller. It wasn't that,it is instead a well-done psychological thriller about a dysfunctional family,schizophrenia,and a lifeless(or is it?)medical doll and it all leads to madness and murder. We were very impressed and watched it again and again. Many years later I found the Andrew Neiderman novel in a used bookstore and immediately remembered this great movie and was blown away by the much darker tone of the book,but I longed to see the movie again. Well,years later and I have a dvd player and I happily discovered this great movie on dvd! Anchor Bay did a fantastic job with a nice widescreen print,a trailer,and an interesting commentary track by the screen-writer/director and a journalist.

I won't bore you with the movies details, because it seems all the other reviews have already done that.  But I was studying Psychology at the time and we needed to pick a movie and do a term paper on it.  We were in groups of 5 or 6 and while all the other groups were picking mainstream movies, I talked our group into picking Pin.  We were the only group that got an ""A"" because our teacher said that the movie was so bizarre.  I hesitate recommending this movie now, because a lot has happened in the movies over the past 15 years that were equally or more wacky.  So it may not be as strange now, as it was then.

It tries to examine the process by which someone could go completely insane, and succeeds.

At first a source of amusement and comfort, Pin demonically evolves into the object of Leon's mad fixation. Soon, Leon and Pin quietly but thoroughly eliminate anyone who intrudes into their private world. One reason I loved The Ring is that is was scary and it went back to the intelligent horror films that actually scared it's audience. Pin does the same. While not as scary as The Ring it does pack atmosphere and suspense. It's a bit long but it's still good.

7823052,4,6302247829,"PIN

PIN is one of those psychological horror thrillers that rely heavily on suspense and peculiarities to create a mood of discomfort and interest.  It's the total opposite of your typical gore-fest film of the 80s, and fans of the genre that are expecting lots of blood and murder probably won't like it much.  Yet, you'll find the movie provides a somewhat discomforting feeling through other means, and this amplifies the effectiveness because it seems so much more real.

The focus of the film is on a small family, the image of perfection.  The father is a doctor.  Mother is a fastidious housekeeper.  They have an extroverted, outgoing daughter, and a shy, introspective son.  PIN is the 5th member of the family, an anatomically accurate dummy that dad uses in a bizarre ventriloquism act to both make his young patience at ease, and to explain difficult subjects to them.  And so, PIN develops his own persona with the children, but it is the son, Leon, who really starts to see PIN as a living, thinking being, an actual member of the family.

It becomes clear that Leon's mental health is not all that great, and that the perfect family life shows some seriously repressive behavior.  Life for Leon is particularly lonely, and he soon begins to rely more on more on PIN to help him through his struggles.  PIN becomes Leon's only friend.

The film goes on to examine the family structure, and with the demise of the parents, the relationship between Leon and his sister Ursula.  As Leon's mind degenerates, PIN becomes an increasingly important part of Leon's ego, to the point that Leon actually becomes more PIN than himself.  These scenes with PIN are somewhat amusing as Leon increasing treats him as a living member of the family, dressing him up, reserving a spot at the dinner table, even going so far as to enacting a sexual encounter for the dummy.  Trust me, you don't want to miss that scene.

In a lot of ways, the story resembles Psycho.  Both protagonists are timid, intelligent, lonely figures.  Both had dominating mothers, and both have extremely repressed sexual urges that begin to manifest themselves in strange ways.  Like Norman Bates used his dead mother, Leon uses PIN in times of anxiety as a stress reliever, a conduit in which to act out things he never could as Leon.  But unlike Norman Bates, Leon seems to draw out our sympathies.  We both fear and fear for him, at times despising him, and at other times relating to him.

It's a complex movie, and the creepy factor might turn a lot of people off of it.  It is very deliberate in it's buildup, and it's lack of action or violence might further alienate some viewers, but it's a really well thought out movie, perfectly acted, and definitely worth seeing.",1317513600,,2748,4.712788259958072
