7957362,5,B00005YWK0,I bought this book for my teenage niece and she loved it.  I gives wonderful guidance for anyone just learning to play a guitar.  Highly recommended!,1376179200,,149,4.6923076923076925
7957363,1,B00005YWK0,"I ordered this video thinking it would be a video dvd, but it was a audio dvd. I could hear the words but no picture. Kind of hard to learn guitar with no pictures...",1265932800,5,166,3.911764705882353
7957364,1,B00005YWK0,"I ordered this CD in hopes of experiencing a good intro to beginning acoustic guitar. What I received, however, was a CD that directed me to a website where, try as I may, I could NOT locate any video instruction as advertised. Perhaps I received a VERY different CD and it was packaged as ""Acoustic Guitar Basics"" but for my expectations, it was completely useless. I looked for hidden menu choices, but there were none. I only had two choices once the CD opened...proceed to website and exit. If anyone can enlighten me, feel free.",1120003200,9,533,4.621052631578947
7957365,4,B00005YWK0,"This DVD is much better than the video that came with my Yamaha guitar and it contains all the information a beginner needs to know to get started playing:  parts of the guitar, tuning, basic guitar maintenance, how to interpret tablature, popular chords, strumming, fingerpicking, and more advanced stuff like hammer-ons and pull-offs.  You'll be playing basic chords in a matter of minutes, and after learning a few you'll follow along while a progression is played on-screen.  This part is difficult and will take a bit of practice.  In the end you'll have a good foundation for continuing with more advanced instruction.",1045094400,99,624,5.088235294117647
