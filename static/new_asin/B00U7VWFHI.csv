I tried to watch the video but with its credibility ruined, I couldn't get interested in the slow-paced narrative.  The videography was nice, but it dwelt on the many museums' pieces which slowed down the already languorous tempo.  I was hoping to use it as a teaching tool, but even without the egregious historical errors it was just too boring to hold even my interest, who loves D.C. and American History.  You might see if your local library has this and preview it before purchasing.  I hate to give a terrible rating to this visually pleasant film, but I can't see giving it much more than a 1.  Guess I'll give it a 2.",1435017600,,818,4.606896551724138
