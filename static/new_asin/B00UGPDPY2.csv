8705612,5,B00UGPDPY2,Awesome. Special Edition brings a new experience to your LOTR viewing. Fills in gaps from the theatrical version to adhere more closely to the book. Brings a side of Aragorn out which makes the character even more enduring if that's at all possible. Special feature discs are worth every minute of viewing as well. I now have all of the trilogy in Special Edition. A must for any trilogy fan.,1486080000,,392,4.614285714285714
