4436689,5,B004O0CKAK,"As a addendum to the only other review, it seems Acorn did release season 2002 11 days later. Yesterday this DVD was $55 as I had listed my used copy at $44.44, the lowest price. Today Amazon is offering this collection at $40.49 with free shipping. Go new, Go Amazon, buy this collection! The Ranger Gord Cartoons in near HD quality with a 1080p TV and an HDMI cord are priceless!  I am removing my collection for sale. Watch the price go back up to $55",1312848000,,454,4.27906976744186
4436690,5,B004O0CKAK,"Without even getting into what episodes are on these seasons (Which are all fantastic by the way), in order to get season 2002, you have to buy this box set because acorn media did not release it as an individual season. That is true though for season 2000 and 2001 which are available as single seasons. I do not care for this type of packaging of the seasons so for that matter I only give it 3 stars but the episodes get 5+ stars. I am purchasing this box set because the quality of the episodes in this show in unbeatable! Any season of this show is highly recommended.",1305849600,,573,4.26605504587156

8436913,5,B004O0CKAK,"On the first set (the 2000 season) the labels of disk one and disk two have been swapped. The episodes are all present, just make sure you double check when you put your first disk in to make sure that it's indeed the first episode of the season. Normally this would not be a big deal since each one is essentially a stand-alone, but the 2000 season is when Harold returns and watching that first episode somewhere in the middle would lessen the impact and lead to some continuity issues. ;-)",1328745600,,492,4.417582417582418
