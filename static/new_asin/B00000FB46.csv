7908065,4,B00000FB46,"This story is essentially a retelling of Robin Hood, although like many European films, it does not have a happy ending, and indeed, the hero, Charuga, is blinded by his own ambition to gain more wealth. Like most people in his position, of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, he starts to succumb to his own greed. Unfortunately this leads to his own demise. Excellent film, well worth the time.",980899200,,404,4.5479452054794525
