661011,5,6303451446,"This is a watershed performance for Richard Pryor. This was filmed shortly after the infamous freebasing fire nearly killed him in the early 1980s. Here, he talks frankly about that incident (the joke with the match is an amazing example of how he could find humor inhis darkest moments) and his need to quit drinking and dope. The tour de force here is the Africa routine. The cologne and body odor gag falls back on some un-PC stereotyping of Africans(of course, PC types aren't gonna watch this anyway), but his announced decision in this piece to never use the N-word again in comedy got a standing-o from me then and still makes me proud of him today. Sadly, this was his last truly great comedic work. From here on in, it would be unbearably bad movies and lackluster comedy like ""Here and Now"" before he succumbed to MS. So this is truly important as the last great work of Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor. Enjoy.",1107820800,13,925,4.612121212121212
661012,5,6303451446,"Richard Pryor is the king, no question. He inspired most top comics today, and this stand up shows why. Alot of people forget that most comedy is recycled, and mostly from this man here. It's definitely worth buying, and you'll want his other stand-ups before you know it!",1085011200,5,272,4.6875
661013,2,6303451446,"The producers of this film, evidently thinking people weren't going to recognize what was funny in a Richard Pryor stand-up act, all but butchered a good performance by *overdubbing* conspicuous applause and crowd noises at odd moments and frequently cutting to shots of the audience, obviously shot at different times, and inserted at random. When listening to an amazing stand-up comedian as Pryor, the last thing you want is for the camera to stray off the stage...",1082246400,12,468,5.090909090909091
661014,5,6303451446,"This is definitely one of the funniest stand up performances I have ever seen. Richard Pryor is one of the greatest comedians of all time. It is so sad that he can't talk anymore. He was definitely the most talented storyteller I have ever seen. His stories are SOO funny. He is also a great imitator. His imitations only make his act funnier. A lot of today's comedians can't compare to Richard. He was one of a kind. His routine about Africa is hilarious. Jamie Foxx's terrible routine about Africa can't compare to Richard's. This is definitely the most vulgar stand up routine I have ever seen. So if you have young children,DO NOT let them come CLOSE to ANY of Richard's movies. Otherwise,sit back and enjoy one of the greatst stand up performances ever recorded!",1065657600,12,768,4.654411764705882
661015,3,6303451446,"This to me at least can't compare to Richard Pryor live. It's funny...Richard Pryor is a comic genius...but, the jokes didn't keep me rolling as much as Live in Concert.",1053907200,8,169,4.666666666666667
661016,4,6303451446,"I first saw this film with a friend and we were both laughing so hard we constantly had to stop the film just to recover.  Richard Pryor is absolutely one of the funniest and most honest human beings who ever lived. As far as I'm concerned the only comedian who has even come close is Bernie Mac. But Bernie is tame compared to the full throttle antics of Pryor.
Pryor approaches the show knowing the audience has read a lot about his troubled personal life so he comes out and point blank explains everything. From how he ran down the block after setting himself on fire accidentally, to his troubled marriage, to his trip to Africa and how it changed him.
There's a lot of F-bombs (surprise) so you probably don't want to watch this movie in mixed company. If you're sensitive to ""white people are so funny"" routines then you should probably get a life. But if you wanna hear about how even the African hares intimidated Pryor (""I ain't never seen a rabbit look at me like that before"") or how the lions wanted to eat him and his camera, then this is a movie that will have you laughing so hysterically you'll probably pee in your pants.",1033516800,28,1139,4.423809523809524
661017,4,6303451446,"this stand up comedy is the one of all stand ups...this is where eddie murhpy gets a good sense of his jokes as well...anything about richard pryor is a hit...richard never been in any movie, t.v. show that was not popular. even bill cosby gets some words from richard pryor...richard pryor is the god of comedy.",1015113600,2,312,4.589285714285714
661018,4,6303451446,"One could easily predict that Richard Pryor was going to end up a very sad, embittered figure in his older age, if he was even still alive, after seeing this stand-up performance when it first came out.  That is when I first saw it. Which is not to say that this is not a howlingly funny stand-up act most of the time.  It is that too.  Like most comics though, Pryor was not fueled by much good that had happened in his life, but rather by the things which had enraged him or enabled him to see the world with an all too cynical eye.  I liked him much better as this stand-up comedy performer than I ever did as an actor though.

He made so many lame comic films with Gene Wilder that I lost count of them.  If that is the only way you have seen him perform, in movies with Wilder, you really missed seeing his true talent. I think Pryor would have served himself better as a performer had he stayed in this  medium instead of becoming an actor. Some people may find Pryor offensive in stand-up but I think that is generally true of most stand-up comedy acts.  Stand-up tends to use a lot of profanity and vulgarity because they are time proven audience pleasers.

661019,3,6303451446,"Actually, I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. But it was a little funnier when it came out almost 20 years ago. Some of his stand-up reaches for the F word for laughs, and in that it comes up short. But there are some extremely  funny segments, particularly his telling of how he tried to force some  mobsters at gunpoint to pay him what they owed him. That and some of his  story of his trip to Africa show some sides of Pryor that made him famous.  He even dips into a little ""Mudbone"" - a character he created in  the seventies that was an old man from Tupelo Mississippi. It's a good  watch if only to see where so many of today's comics, particularly today's  black comics, have evolved from. But some of the content, the references he  makes, may seem dated. Gen Xers might not get the joke, for example (so  what's new?). But it's a quality watch nevertheless. Rent this and Eddie  Murphy's first live show he did and it will be a study in great black  comedians.",957312000,10,961,4.283333333333333

If you are easily offended, too uptight, or 'born again', this is not the concert movie for you! Nobody gets away from being made fun of, especially white people!  It is truly amazing to watch Pryor slip in and out of his countless characters. His genious plays out with ease and he improvs alot of the show. Seamless bits go by and you're so busy laughing, you may miss the next one. Pryor even brings out his famous friend 'Mudbone' for a full 15 minutes. All of the younger comics working today owe one to Pryor. Eddie Murphy looked up to him as an idol and even used the same song for his end credits in 'Raw'.

I would have to agree with an earlier reviewer that its not as funny as Live in Concert, but make no mistake, the momentum is definitely there. He handles his freebasing incident in a very humorous but in a redeemed manner.

The consistency of jokes in this performance is extremely good and unlike Here and Now (in which the audience members are rude and boorish), this is a nice crowd and a very receptive audience, (known faces include a very young Jesse Jackson in the audience).

He does Mudbone and his jokes about his trip to Africa and the epiphany he has there and his decision never to use the N word again, truly shows how much he has evolved as a performer and as a human being. He truly shows you his real self when he performs and that for me rates Richard Pryor as an honest comedian, with a big heart.",1231718400,2,1252,4.364806866952789

661577,5,6303451446,"Peoria,Illinois-born Richard Pryor delivers another hilarious comedy routine filled with profanity of course. Unbelievably,one of the audience members was Rev. Jesse Jackson. Does Pryor mention the N-word? Of course,he does. Pryor,who followed in the footsteps back in the 1960's of another comedian three years his senior,Bill Cosby,influenced another trashmouthed comedian years later,Eddie Murphy. Both Pryor and Murphy influenced other trashmouthed black comedians such as Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle. Cosby himself,has always detested the use of profanity. Instead of the so-called profane words rhyming with ""luck"" and ""spit"",Cosby would instead say ""filth,foul,filth"". It may have happened to Pryor,Rock and Chapelle,but Cosby did once chastise Murphy on the phone for Murphy's obscene humor. I believe Cosby believes that profanity use is totally unnecessary. That's why Cosby's humor,as opposed to those of the others,is suitable for young children. In this concert,Pryor displays sexually-oriented humor as usual with the commonly spoken slang.

Pryor acquiesced. ""Okay. This is the last time."" It wasn't funny. (The audience was in stitches.) It wasn't funny to me. So, I don't get it. Boomer drug culture? I'll bet I'm not the only person who doesn't find this funny.",1195603200,,678,4.658333333333333

To be honest, just get the Bourbon Street video. THIS is all you need
to get the real Richard Pryor, I know this is short and not so sweet, but you will learn.

661613,4,6303451446,"Richard Pryor is in good form on the Sunset Strip.  He seems to be a bit uneasy at the beginning, but as talented as he is, he manages to deliver a great show regardless.  The laughter ceases during certain periods - such as when Pryor discusses his freebasing accident, his drug addiction, and his abandonment of the use of the N word - but there are still plenty of laughs here.  Live on the Sunset Strip is not quite as good as Live in Concert, but still to be highly recommended.",1186790400,,483,4.285714285714286

661615,5,6303451446,"Richard Pryor was beyond funny and this show proves it. The quickness of his mind, the incomparable quality of his voice and his ability to mimic, his timing, his honesty...funny is just the beginning of appreciating Richard Pryor. Here is a guy famous for dropping N-bombs throughout his career, publicly declaring to never use the word again. And this was in 1982...25 years ago! Think of the latest news involving Don Imus, of Michael Richards' onstage comedy rant using the N-word...Pryor was a quarter-century ahead of all the gangsta rappers in moving past negative racial epithets. He seems to have no defenses whatsoever about himself or his behavior in this filmed concert. His imitation of a Mafia clubowner is about as good as comedy gets. Pryor to my mind set the bar so high maybe only Eddie Murphy can attempt the heights of comedy Pryor reached in his lifetime.",1176768000,,876,4.885906040268456
661616,5,6303451446,"I first saw this in a campus film festival.  This has got to be one of the FUNNIEST routines I have ever watched!  I laughed so hard I thought I'd break my ribs from laughing.  Richard Pryor was a gifted comedian and a hell of a story teller!  His Africa routine and the one about the wino was just too funny for words.  I was actually gasping for breath between laughs on this one.

Although Pryor used rude language, that still does not take anything away from the sheer humor of his stories and wickedly funny brand of story telling.  He even jokes about his own then precarious health as well as the dissolution of his marriage and how his perspectives in general changed when he went to Africa.  He could take the most serious topics and convert them into sheer hilarity.  To this day I can't watch him for 5 minutes without keeling over laughing.

Don't drink anything before you watch this movie.  If you fear you might spontaneously urinate while laughing, then you might want to wait a few hours after you've had any liquids.",1164153600,2,1034,4.475935828877005
661617,5,6303451446,"I must first preface my comments by saying that I think Larry the Cable Guy is funny guy, but he is no Richard Pryor.  I am a white anglo-saxon who thinks that Richard Pryor was one of the most funny people who ever lived, and if you asked Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, or Ron White who was the better comedian I think they would all pick Richard Pryor because Rich could find humor in the most unlikeliest sources, whereas Larry is rather obvious in his basis for humor.  Good though, but not as profound as Richard Pryor.  This along with the other two Richard Pryor stand up films should be the proof of what a comedian is all about.  Yes, Rich used rough language, but listen to words between the cuss words, he was a very smart comic who had all the ablities needed to be the legend he was.",1158624000,,795,4.28
661618,5,6303451446,"omgosh, I can't believe some one said the cable guy is funnier than Richard Pryor.. this country is definately going to hell in a handbasket! LOL!!!!!

661619,5,6303451446,"I bought this as part of a two-pack with Dave Chappelle. Unfortunately, I watched Pryor first. It was so funny with almost constant laughter, that it ruined the Chappelle DVD for me. Chappelle (who is great on his TV show), just fell flat after watching the Pryor DVD. If you buy the two-pack, watch Chappellle as the ""opening act,"" maybe it'll seem funny that way. But definitely save Pryor as the ""headline"" act & watch it last, he just can't be beat. Pryor was a real innovator, funny, insightful, honest, & what a great job he did here!",1144454400,3,540,4.520408163265306
661620,3,6303451446,"I purchased this DVD off the used rack after the man passed away.  I feel bad about his death, not that I had anything to do with it or anything, but it's always sad to see a genius of the comic variety go, but I must say I was quite disappointed in this routine.  You see, I'd only recently caught Git-R-Done, the musings of one ""Larry the Cable Guy.""  Once you watch Larry, you will simply find that you will never again laugh so hard.  And when I watched this, I didn't.

Had Richard lived on, perhaps he too could have learned a thing or two about comedic timing and topical humor from Larry the Cable Guy.  I anxiously await this funny brut's new movie.  I'm quite sure hilarity will ensue.",1144195200,,695,4.259541984732825
661621,1,6303451446,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. He may have been the funniest comedian ever up through his generation, but he certainly is not any more. I can't remember laughing outloud once during this DVD. Again, I'm sure age difference plays a part. People dropping F-bombs and being raunchy in comedy isn't new or outrageous to me, it's in everything I watch. I don't want to take anything away from Richard Pryor, he paved the way and inspired alot of the people that I ""DO"" enjoy. But I didn't find this funny. If you want something truely hilarious, check out Dave Chapelle's ""For What It's Worth"".",1138320000,,599,4.555555555555555
661622,5,6303451446,"Richard Pryor has influenced scores and scores of comedians and theres a good reason why....because hes one of the greats!!!  This show which was filmed in Vegas is truly his finest hour.  Taped after his infamous freebasing incident,  he touches on his cocaine addiction....and as brutal as it was he makes it funny.  Also,  he talks about gangsters he used to work with and them telling murder stories!!  No comedian would dare touch on things like this,  and to make these things funny takes TALENT.  Of which Pryor has an abundance of.

  So if you want a revealing,  awe inspiring,  provacative and funny comedy show,  this is it.  Pryors finest hour,  the show of himself.",1113436800,16,678,4.765217391304348
