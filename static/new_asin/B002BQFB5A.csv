8361839,5,B002BQFB5A,"Nice video about shooting with a single light source. Mark Daughn does a good job of explaining what he's doing and why. Considering the cost of attending a workshop, being able to replay the video, and seeing it actually done versus reading about it, I'd say this is worth it. Though I've done quite a bit of shooting like this already, there were still a number of tricks here that were new to me. Definitely something I'd recommend to a buddy who was serious about this type of photography.",1322352000,,493,4.550561797752809
8361840,1,B002BQFB5A,"Spending about 50.00 for a training DVD, I suspect it to arrive new and unused. I got the package from amazon with the DVD flopping around in the unsealed case. The DVD looked like it has been in the trunk of someone vehicle. Very disappointed, first impressions are ever lasting. I WILL NOT order another from this series.
