7038541,5,B00UGPEWFI,the first 2 movies of burt reynolds are great the 3 one is jerry reed trying  something funny but it's great. the brian bloom 4 set movie's are great to. rumor has it that the brian bloom movie's is like the next generation or son of the bandit to make it more clearer.,1302220800,,269,4.0754716981132075
7038542,5,B00UGPEWFI,THEY INFORMED ME OF THE SHIPMENT AND IT WAS FAST. MY PRODUCT CAME IN THE CONDITION THEY SAID. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE. I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE. AND I WOULD USE THEM AGAIN.,1299542400,,186,4.194444444444445
7038543,4,B00UGPEWFI,"I do NOT own this item.. and.. it doesn't seem, now anyway, that you can order it. And.. granted.. The later ""Bandit"" movies just aren't the same as the Burt movies.. but then again.. was Smokey and the Bandit 3 all that great?

Umm.. no. Granted.. the newer ones were late night tv affairs.. but I actually became a fan of Brian Bloom from it, he's actually started showing up again in movies.. and I remember them all having kind of ""fun"" stories.. with Mel Tillis popping up, in the old series, as well as the new.. you had John C. Reilley if I remember right as well as Tracy Lords, Kathy Ireland and Elizabeth Berkley.. and the original helmer back for most, if not all of the new films.. I wish they HAD invested a bit more money.. thrown a bit more polish.. and got Burt to cameo.. a nice little passing of the torch.. or.. heck.. have the old Bandit and Snowman still in the mix.. would have been a great touch.. but seeing the latter FOUR have been IMPOSSIBLE to find.. I can only say this is a GREAT collection.. any of the hard to find stuff, and ANYTHING that gets them release is a great thing.",1298073600,,1107,4.271428571428571
7038544,5,B00UGPEWFI,Tina is the only one on track I have all of these movies it took me a long time to find the bandit movies with bloom. This is for all you na sayers who wrote reviews here if you don't like something fine but don't bash them I have and always will love all the bandit shows all great for there time even blooms his was a breath of fresh air for that time you can not go wrong by buying this,1291507200,4,389,3.7560975609756095
7038545,2,B00UGPEWFI,"The Brian Bloom movies weren't even on par with todays made for DVD level garbage, They were part of an experiment back in the 90s called ""Universal Television's Action Pack"". It was a group of made for TV movies acting as a half season of back door pilots that were lumped all together and rotated so every Tueday night there was a new one and the same series would be on in that slot once a month. It included 4 of the William Shatner Tekwar books, 5 for the Kevin Sorbo version of Hercules. 3 based on the Deniro movie Midnight Run with Christopher Mcdonald ruining the Deniro part, 4 of Vanishing Son and the Bandit fiascos.

Of the entire roster the only ones that never made it past the pilots were Midnight Run and the Bandit. Hercules went on for what seemed like forever and even spawned the Xena series. Tekwar fizzled out after one season as did Vanishing son. But history remembers Vansishing Son as the series that broke thru and made it possible for an actual Asian to be considered as the lead for an American TV series.",1287878400,2,1035,4.4188481675392675
7038546,4,B00UGPEWFI,"I happen to like the newer Bandit movies.  No, they aren't the same as Burt Reynolds, but that's okay, too.  They aren't trying to duplicate them, its just a good ole boy, gettin' into trouble, and tryin' to get out of it.  They aren't re-makes to the older versions, just similar in theory.

I don't believe I've seen them all, - I remember only three of them, but they were enjoyable.  Brian Bloom looked good in a cowboy hat & tight jeans, i think.  It wasn't a Trans-Am, but I did have a love of the Dodge Stealth afterward! And how can you resist those PIERCING blue eyes?

They also have great cameo appearances, too.  Mel Tillis, Kathy Ireland, Henry Cho, & John Schneider.  Give them a chance.",1283904000,26,701,4.4140625

7038601,3,B00UGPEWFI,"The blu ray edition isn't any better. The sounds of everything are different: cars, the semi, police sirens, etc. It's not the same as the original. Plus, there's a scene missing. I've seen this movie so many times I remember the dialog of what's missing.

What I mean is: Right after they stop to feed Fred and before pulling into the 76 Station.. This scene is gone. Bandit spots a police car going the other way and says, ""Son, pull the hammer back. Smokey is coming at you in a plain white wrapper."" Carrie, ""That's your police unit in your basic white car."" ""Very good."" ""Son are you out there? I'm talking to ya son."" Snowman finally replied, ""Alright bring it on, what is it?"" Bandit, ""When you get that damn dog in the truck, you can put the hammer down cuz by that time the smokey will have gone by you."" Snowman looks out and says, ""How'd he know that.""

It's not much of a scene but definitely missing. I found that scene while they still aired it on the version on the Sleuth channel a few years ago. Now, you can't find it on any of the cable channels or media releases unless you have an old, maybe VHS, copy.",1483315200,,1123,4.2924528301886795

I have LOVED this movie for years and years, and even my daughter, who did become a truck driver, fell in love with it too!  The comedy of Burt Reynolds, and Jackie Gleason, and of course Jerry Reed is just too priceless.  I remember the first time my Dad saw this movie.  He laughed so hard and long, he cried!  I recommend it to anyone needing a good laugh.  But you must know that it's kind of a dry humor type.  I think.",1470873600,6,560,3.981981981981982

7038878,5,B00UGPEWFI,"Okay, here is what you need to keep in mind going in....

YOU NEED TO RELAX.

 These are light-hearted, fun 'summer' movies, and not intended to be taken seriously in any way, shape or form.

Fomer Stuntman and all-around great guy Hal Needham* crafted the original 'Smokey And The Bandit' concept, and it is a top-notch classic comedy...
The follow-up sequels go downhill in entertainment value...Personally, I have always felt that #2 began with a poor premise by NOT taking place immediately following the events of the original (Needham should have sent Bandit, Frog & Snowman after that clam chowder!)
The 'Bandit' tv movies with Brian Bloom are on par with the average 'Dukes Of Hazzard' episode; basic feel-good-fun-on-the-run light plots...I like to think of them as 'Bandit-Legend-in-the-making' prequels to the original movie (even though the vehicles clearly put them later in time than the `77 movie ) The 'Bandit' tv movies were part of the rotating 'Action Pack' series of made-for-tv movies (which also featured similar tv movies taking off on the bounty hunter comedy 'Midnight Run')

 My advice; sit back, open a brew (or a few) and just relax for 90 minutes with these !

* Read Needham`s book; 'Stuntman!: My Car-Crashing, Plane-Jumping, Bone-Breaking, Death-Defying Hollywood Life'
...It`s a great read !",1372118400,,1324,5.158878504672897
7038879,4,B00UGPEWFI,"The first two movies, of course, are classics. THey are great!

Not so enthused with the third, the snowman does not make a good bandit.

The newer ones with the stealth are good movies in the late '80's fasion, but trust me you won't confuse them with the originals. More of a ""Knight Rider/Macguiver/A-Team"" feel to them. Having grown up in the late 80's and early 90's, I do like them. The Stealth was definately ""the affordable supercar"" of the time, and still can sort of be considered ""American"".",1369958400,2,502,4.629213483146067

7038898,2,B00UGPEWFI,"The original Smokey and the Bandit is one of the greatest action/comedies ever made, but the franchise quickly goes downhill from there.  Part 2 gets kind of silly with Dom DeLuise and an elephant, and Reynolds' Bandit isn't very likeable in this one, but it's still Smokey and the Bandit.  Part 3 is a silly, convoluted mess.  Jackie Gleason is brilliant, as usual.  Big Enis and Little Enis, funny as hell in their small parts in the previous two films, are way overexposed here.....too much of a good thing.  Jerry Reed comes across as childish and ridiculous in his hero worship and subsequent Bandit impersonation...""I get to be the Bandit!  I get to be the Bandit!""  You almost expect him to throw an ""Oh golly gee willikers"" in there for good measure.  The best thing about the actress playing Reed's tagalong is the shot of her backside as she changes clothes in the car.  Other than that, she's horrible.  No chemistry with Reed whatsoever and she has no personality.  Now...for the four made-for-TV Bandit movies included.  I had never seen or even heard of these movies before.  Once I got past my initial ""What the hell is this crap?"" reaction, they weren't really bad movies.  Unfortunately, they weren't really good, either.  Brian Bloom is just too much of a pretty boy to be taken seriously and he just comes across as someone who would look much more at home playing some guy named Blayde in a daytime soap opera.  Basically, the new movies are just standard made-for-TV fare.  Better than watching paint dry, but not by much.",1332115200,4,1543,4.719101123595506

7038904,4,B00UGPEWFI,"Smokey and the Bandit has been in just about every mans collection of movie greats since it was made back int he late 70's. Bandit, Carrie and Snowman come together to attempt to bootleg beer across state lines due to a bet from a couple of rich guys. Everyone already knows the plot to the first movie, so I won't bother reviewing it more then what I have said already.

The second movie seems to go 50/50 between fans of S&TB, some like it, some absolutely hate it. Again, I've reviewed that one before, so I won't review it again, then of coarse comes the 3rd movie that was originally to star Jackie Gleason as both the Bandit and Smokey, but something went astray there and Jerry Reed was brought back in to play the Bandit, leaving fans wondering why Burt Reynolds didn't play Bandit, especially since he was there in there in the end for a cameo... but again, I've already reviewed the first 3 movies, and by now, if you don't know the first 3 are already available on DVD together, then you are not who I am aiming this review at. If you do own the Pursuit Pack, and are not one of the ""Smokey 1 was the only decent movie"", and are interested to know what the next 4 mini series versions are like, then put your ears on son.

Bandit Goes Country - At first I was put off by the fact that this main actor is named Bandit, but looks much younger then Burt Reynolds... I was wondering if maybe these where prequels? Then I heard the names being used, and it confirmed this is not a prequel, it is set in 1994. It never was explained if this younger guy was supposed to be the same character Burt originally portrayed, but then I found out these where made for TV as pilots for a season of TV shows, but it never got past the pilot season, so what they are to me now, looking at them current day, I thought maybe it would be believable if I thought of this as Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Frogs (Sally Field) son... even tho the maths doesn't work out with the age of this new Bandit, it is only a movie. Another thing that put me off was the choice of car, at first I really hated it, then I discovered it actually IS a trans-am, it was just the latest model... I would have preferred one between the years of 1977 and 85 somewhere, but I guess Hal Needham stuck to what he did last time and used the latest models.

Anyway, the first movie see's Bandit and his best friend (Whoever that guy who played Leo in Charmed is) rescue a plane that is about to crash in a pretty unbelievable way, and then the members of the small flight tag along for the rest of the movie, expecting Bandit to take them to the airport, but instead Bandit heads home to his home town to do some really dumb things he is asked to do, and then try and patch up with an ex girlfriend. The first movie here I thought was pretty bad, but yet, it was watchable from start to finish. It wasn't exactly destroying the previous S&TB universe, and it was nice to see two familiar faces from previous Hal Needham films, both being in previous Cannonball Run movies, and one in Smokey II (The Stuttering guy and Don-Don (I think he was famous once, but before my time) - I guess Hal Needham was a big fan of ""Blue Lagoon"" and ""Return to Blue Lagoon"" because he cast both male leads of those movies in this one. Overall, I'd only give the first one 2.5 stars.

Bandit Bandit - at first I got goose bumps seeing John Schneider's name come up in the opening credits... John played Bo Duke, and the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" was based on the original Smokey and The Bandit movie, so it was nice to see them coming together... but then John started his terrible acting of trying to portray a hard-butt cop, and I rolled my eyes at how pathetic it sounded. The plot to this one is Bandit has an impostor who steals a pickup of a car of the future (yeah it sounds lame enough already) that is supposed to be unveiled by the governor, so Bandit and his friend have to go out looking for the stolen car that is in their stolen truck. Overall, there was some pretty bad acting and scenes in this one, still, I got to the end of it un-bored, so again, 2.5 stars.

Beauty and the Bandit - Being a fan of National Lampoons Loaded Weapon, I liked seeing the lead chick from that in this one, but to everyone else, you probably think ""who cares?"" but this one here I don't think was based on me perving her out, this one actually wasn't too bad a movie. Bandit is supposed to be Grand Marshall at Daytona for a Nascar race, but doesn't make it due to his car being hijacked by the chick I mentioned. When he catches up with her, he ends up helping her out as she is involved in something that Bandit wants to help her out with. There is some decent humor in this one, and a bit of a touching ending. Overall - This one wasn't bad, I give it 3.5 stars.

Silver Angel - Bandit's uncle dies and leaves him a carnival... however someone is harassing the carnival and trying to put it out of business for a takeover. Of coarse Bandit finds Angel (Traci Lords) a potential Bond girl, so he does what he can to help out the carnival and put a stop to who is behind the sabotage and crookedness going on. Overall - wasn't a great episode either, 2.5 stars.

Overallsm Overall of the 1994 Bandit series... as I said, go into them thinking this new guy is the real Bandits son, and they aren't all that bad. They're not must see shows, but there is worse things out there. If you are interested in them, it's only a couple of bucks more then the pursuit pack, and you're pretty much only paying for the first 3 movies, and getting 4 extras for free, so it's not a bad deal. If you only liked the first one or two, then buy those on their own or the pursuit pack or whatever, but if you didn't like 2 and 3, you definitely are not going to enjoy the 1994 series.

DVD contents. There are no bonus features, the first movie is NOT the special edition, part 1 is on a single disc. Parts 2 and 3 are on the same disc (not flip sided) and the four 1994 series are two movies to two separate discs and are not flip sided either.... oh, and no subtitles.",1316908800,35,6083,4.188727583262169
