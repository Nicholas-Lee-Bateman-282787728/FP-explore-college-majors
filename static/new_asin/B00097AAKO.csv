2269686,3,B00097AAKO,"but not as useful for practicing as I had hoped.  It's fun to watch - especially if you're just learning like I am but I really would like to practice between classes and this, in my opinion, is not the DVD for that.",1356480000,2,216,4.023255813953488
2269687,5,B00097AAKO,"If you are an ATS dancer, this DVD is a must own! Mimi has put together some really nice combo's using FCBD moves as well as adding her own twist to some. This is geared towards an intermediate dancer with basic FCBD vocabulary. Mimi breaks down each move facing forward, with another dancer facing away, so you can follow along with no trouble. Each combo is demonstrated for a solo, duet and trio, with a short song drill afterwards. Some of the music is alittle repetitious, but her clear, easy to follow instruction and wonderful technique make it totally worthwhile. This DVD is lots of fun and I felt like I got quite alot out of it. I would love to see her come out with another volume!",1351209600,,693,4.421875
2269688,5,B00097AAKO,This DVD is the perfect thing to spruce up your ATS. The combos are great and the instruction is very streight forward. The solo suggestions are wonderful too. You won't be disapointed.,1331769600,,185,4.8125
2269689,5,B00097AAKO,"No hassles or complicated movements. Simple, easy and well done, I am a beginner in ATS and was very easy to follow Mimi instructions in all combinations. Beautifully presented as well, I really enjoying this DVD.",1320624000,,213,4.944444444444445
2269690,5,B00097AAKO,"For a beginner in ATS style of tribal, this is a GREAT breakdown of the basics!!  And for someone who has been doing Tribal for a while, its a great practice companion!  It slows things down and makes amazing muscle memory!! Its a wonderful resource for anyone who is curious about ATS!",1319500800,,286,4.480769230769231
2269691,4,B00097AAKO,"Tribal Revival consists of variations in footwork and combinations for already established students or those with background in ATS, mostly level 2 and up. If you are new to ATS perhaps you may venture into FCBD for the basics,zil patterns and work up to a comfortable level beyond basics.

After a very brief posture check and technique review, there are seven combinations to learn in several variations.

 The terminology for combinations is in a personal signature of the instructor. These combinations are designed to work for solo to duets, trio and even quartets. With background in ATS I felt the practice runs are generous, adequately broken down, as they are a necessary element in obtaining fluidity and synchronization especially with turns and keeping formation tight. This section requires precise footwork especially during the barrel turns with several dancers.

 With practice,Tribal Revival will bring new awareness to technique, improve footwork and perhaps keep the movement from appearing predictable and repetitious. It is fun to dance alone, or to learn with fellow dancers.
 The production values are strong in this dvd which  brings  the performance section to impressive vividness,  enhancing the colorful costumes.",1309046400,11,1241,5.455497382198953
2269692,5,B00097AAKO,"My whole review really could be summed up by my title:

""Up at 2am and dancing in my PJ's because of this DVD? Why yes, yes I am!""

Which was one of the first things I Tweeted about it back when I first got it. Was I really up at 2am, dancing in my PJ's, just because of this DVD?

Why yes indeed I was.

I am a proud Sister Studio to FCBD -- and damn proud to be madly passionate about ATS. And, I have always been enamored with Mimi's and Manhattan Tribal's dancing. I have emailed Mimi and picked her brain about many a dance related thing, and she has always been refreshingly helpful. So, I could not wait to get my hands on this DVD.

Thank you Mimi, for exciting me to the point of my being up dancing when I should be sleeping. Thank you for creating a DVD that is pure class -- I have not ONE complaint. The videography is great, the teaching is top notch -- clean, neat, easy to follow, easy to understand, and not intimidating (which I think is very important when it comes to instructional bellydance DVDs). And the ""new"" stuff ... is fierce, girlfriend.

I appreciate the chances you take to create and ""grow the dance"", and the respect you give as you do.

You're an asset to the ATS community, and now your DVD is as well.

Thank you for ""keepin' it real"" and keeping it so damn inspiring.

-Leslie",1307318400,4,1313,4.178571428571429
2269693,4,B00097AAKO,"Fun, slightly different variations on the ""usual"" ATS combos.  Mimi explains the movements clearly and I find her body movement easy to follow.  Bright, colorful and well put together.",1305244800,4,184,5.310344827586207
2269694,5,B00097AAKO,"Mimi Fontana's Tribal Revival is a marvelous way to learn her American Tribal Style techniques, and be inspired by her incredible fluid grace and exquisite arm movements. You don't need to know much about belly dancing in the Level 1 portions of this instruction DVD; you'll learn as you go, into the Level 2 and 3 portions as the choreographed pieces become incrementally harder, and with Mimi's clear teaching methods, they are easy to assimilate.

After a warm-up and demonstration of the essential postures and movements, there are 7 choreographed pieces to learn and practice. I love the 2nd dancer mirroring the dance from the back angle as Mimi demonstrates during the teaching portion. The 1st dance, Hey Taxi! Is also shown as a duet, while the 2nd, 3rd and 4th are shown as duet and trio. The final pieces are able to be performed as a solo, duet, trio or quartet.

The performance section is worth the price of admission. The costumes alone delight the eye, and Mimi's 1st solo, with her shimmering golden voluminous pants, and using cymbals, is my favorite piece on the entire DVD.  In the other 3 dances Mimi is with Manhattan Tribal, a lovely group that deserves mention:
Heather Bondra, Debbie Lakis, Rachel Ehrlich, Micol Hiatt, Kate Reid, Maria Naja Richardson, and Stephanie Rubino-Ginsburg. The terrific music includes Solace, Turku, Knossos, Zikrayat, and the Upper Egypt Ensemble.

Belly dancing is the most inclusive of art forms. Short/tall, thin/zaftig, untutored or expert, it welcomes all into its delights (I know a retired gentleman who is having the time of his life learning to belly dance). And Mimi Fontana's Tribal Revival is one of the best places to start.",1304812800,11,1691,4.964664310954063
2269695,5,B00097AAKO,"this is an excellent instructional dvd for the american tribal style (ATS) belly dance. the contents of this dvd is for intermediate level but mimi does a great job breaking down the steps. with practice, you will learn it very quickly and enjoy dancing with one another.

i am also a student of the ATS belly dance and what i really like about this dvd is the way the instructions are presented- during the step by step, i like how there is another dancer facing the back and performing the moves. it is very helpful to watch how the leader moves (from the back) because ATS is based off of improvised cues. essentially, you learn to how read the cues and follow the leader. i also like how at the end of each technique, there is a solo, duet and trio practices.  you can always practice with a friend(s) and have a great time. and at the end of all the techniques, the performances by mimi and manhattan tribal are just beautiful.

in all, i highly recommend this dvd.",1302998400,21,970,4.407821229050279
8058140,5,B00097AAKO,"I love this DVD, but it is not for absolute beginners, as another reviewer has noted. It *is* a great review of American Tribal Style bellydance moves and techniques. I would recommend watching the Fat Chance Belly Dance ""Tribal Basics"" video first - it's much more accessible to beginners, and will give you a pretty solid grounding in not just the steps and movements, but also the muscles you must engage to execute the movement correctly.

This DVD begins with only a very quick review of basic ATS moves, so if you used to take Tribal Style bellydance lessons long ago, but have been away from it for a while (as I have), then this is an excellent reintroduction. You'll soon find your muscle memory kicking in as the old familiar movements come back to you.

Bellydance is a very low-impact, full-range-of-motion workout. I started taking bellydance lessons in my early 30s after an ACL injury and several (expensive!) physical therapy sessions my insurance didn't cover completely. I found a cheap class (at the time, probably $8 per hour!) in a local new age wellness center. It was bellydance or nothing - I didn't have a ""partner"" for other styles of dance, so I had to choose something I could learn to do without a partner. Bellydance was the most obvious choice at the time. I ended up taking bellydance lessons for about 7 or 8 years, and making new friends along the way. I found one road trip buddy who would drive up to Ohio with me to attend seminars and workshops. I got to meet some really well-known dancers, including Mahmoud Reda - which was such an honor and privilege. It enhanced my life in so many ways. I highly encourage anyone even slightly interested in belly dance to start with an easy basics video, such as Fat Chance Belly Dance Tribal Basics. Or, if you want something more authentic to the Middle East, try any of the Veena and Neena Bellytwins dvds - they actually trained in Egypt and danced with the Reda Troupe, so their style is very simple, but very Mahmoud Reda at the same time.

This DVD will get you back up to speed if, like me, you stepped away from dance classes for a few years (in mycase, to save money for graduate school!).

Enjoy!",1488326400,,2185,4.566326530612245

8058145,5,B00097AAKO,"I live in an area where there are very few bellydance studios and definitely NOT any ATS ones, (only the cheezy ""sexy bellydancing"" type!).

There used to be one almost an hour away from me, (so I did have an introduction to ATS prior.)  That being said, I really think this DVD can help you make more sense of the relationship between movements and string them together into flowing combos whether you are dancing solo or in a group.  It's well-shot and produced, and the dancers are beautiful with a wide variety of body types - I truly believe ATS looks great on every woman :)

This DVD really is a FULL ATS class - lots of material and ideas for beginner and intermediate. I would recommend this for someone who at least has had Level 1 ATS training OR has learned all the vocabulary from the ATS Tribal Basics FCBD DVD. I will be going back to this one again and again!",1378771200,,875,4.3496932515337425
8058146,3,B00097AAKO,"This DVD expects that you already know a certain amount of the basic movement vocabulary. She reviews the Takseem, Hand Floreo, Camel Step and Camel Walk, Torso Twist, and Propeller Turn, but then uses a lot more moves in this DVD without further reviewing those first. I don't see the point of reviewing a few moves when she uses quite a lot more throughout the DVD.

Mimi is at times facing the camera, which I usually dislike a lot, when watching instructional DVDs, but then she also has another dancer facing to the back, as if she were a mirror image. However, this is not consistent throughout the DVD. I took two stars off of my review for that, since I think a consistent format is important when teaching. The instructions are interspersed with demos of the moves just taught, which I do like.

The background keeps changing from light to dark. I don't think it is a good choice to put dancers in black clothing in front of a dark background.

This could have been a great advanced DVD, it all the moves would have been demonstrated consistently with one dancer facing the camera and one facing away. However, during the demos the group interaction is well demonstrated.

This DVD offers just a few combos called - Hey Taxi, Tribeca, Double Lotus & Tiki Turn, Thunder 4 Corners, Time Square Shuffle, Whonder Wheel, and Rosha-shemka. I am not aware of these being part of ATS (I could be wrong there). Therefore, I think this is really an ITS (Improvisational Tribal Style) DVD, not ATS (American Tribal Style), as the DVD says. And that is fine, if you are not hung up on learning pure ATS and your troupe isn't either, and you just want to add to your repertoire.",1378080000,4,1674,4.57
8058147,4,B00097AAKO,"I am an intermediate Ats dancer and a soloist and find this dvd to be a good resource for you in-between class home practice. Mimi is very clear with her instructions and her variations add a spice to your dance. Where I found this DVD to be the most useful is with her suggestions on how to use the ats styling for solo work. This DVD saved my bottom when I was asked to come up with a solo. For that, this is gold.

Highly recommended and as others have said, you need to be at least an intermediate dancer because her review portion is way to brief for a beginner.",1376352000,,567,4.108108108108108
8058148,3,B00097AAKO,"I didn't think the instructions were that great, not good for a beginner. I found a better deal for $6.99.",1375315200,,106,4.35
8058149,2,B00097AAKO,"This DVD is frustrating because when Mimi does the combinations to music she is facing the audience, which is really difficult to follow.  When she breaks the combinations down there is someone with her back to the audience so I could follow this portion fairly easily, but the majority of it is with Mimi facing the audience and it's nice to watch but for me it was not easy to follow.",1357603200,2,386,4.436619718309859
