8408513,5,B003XTUAIM,"Is Felipe Martinez Amador the Columbian version of our home-grown Coen brothers? This black comedy contains numerous laugh-out-loud moments and hits all its marks! I can't wait for the Coens to make an American version of this 2007 Comedy/Thriller, although these English captions are right on the mark.

A young man catches his girlfriend having sex with his boss. The boss fires him to get him out of the way and marries the girl. A year later, our young hero photographs that former boss having a fling with a new girlfriend. Intent on blackmail, he is floored when, instead of being blackmailed, that former boss offers him a significant amount of money to kill his current wife (that former girlfriend)! Got that straight?

Watch these folks:
  * Federico Lorusso is Nicols, our frantic hero. Nothing goes right for this poor bungling bozo and he shares his misery with us as he routinely drops the fourth wall and talks directly to us.
  * Victor Mallarino is Pablo Mallarino, that cagey boss. He isn't exactly mean, but he is self-serving.
  * Catalina Aristizbal is a disenchanted Margarita, our hero's former girlfriend and the boss's soon-to-be former wife.
  * Carolina Gomez is a frustrated Alexandra, the boss's latest girlfriend; she's leaving for Peru.
  * Vernica Orozco is Rosemary, our hero's landlady; she seems to have a little side business, too...
  * Luis Eduardo Arango is the puzzled Walter Montes, a married police captain who has been having a fling with that landlady.
  * Felipe Botero is the much put-upon Perez, a better-than-average cop but he's handicapped by his boss, who has something to hide.

There is something so engaging when we watch an amateur try to commit a crime when his only preparation is that he has watched ""CSI"" on TV. Just remember, every single person involved has his or her own agenda!

Ignore the Amazon description of this DVD; these are the right names.",1375488000,,1912,4.885093167701863
8408514,5,B003XTUAIM,"The names of the actors are wrong, but the description is what it says on the back of the DVD box, word for word.  The Columbian version stars Luis Eduardo Arango, Catalina Aristizbal and Blanca Lucero Bello, and is listed as Bluff (I) 2007 under imdb.com ([...]).
We thought this was a fabulous movie, hilarious, with an unusual story line.  Unfortunately, there have been many movies made called ""Bluff"", and it's confusing to find reviews.  But my husband and I thought this was great, and I'm hoping this will help someone!",1288483200,5,527,4.769230769230769
