8304455,5,B001G8MGTS,"I find I keep going back to this DVD to study and appreciate John Blackwell's drumming talent in greater depth. Respectfully said, he may not be as articulate as some folks might want, but he does have a remarkable drumming message for us ... so listen up. The guy's played with an amazing array of musician's and deserves our taking time to hear his 'gift' of drumming clearly. You'll be a better drummer for it!",1408147200,,413,4.52

8304457,2,B001G8MGTS,"Hudson Music had a special offer happening: 50 % off all digital downloads. So I decided to purchase this title. (According to Hudson, the download contains exactly the same material as the physical DVD package.)

First thing I noticed: the editing is outrageously sloppy in places. Near the end of one of the early segments, e.g., John Blackwell is cut off in mid-sentence!

This DVD was shot in front of a live audience. People had a chance to ask questions. I felt that Mister Blackwell did a rather poor job in answering many - if not most - of the questions.

What also stood out was just how often he makes a point, adds one or two short sentences, and then makes exactly the same point again. This became very boring very quickly.

My personal highlight was the guest appearance of Marcus Williams. He gave some great and useful advice. It is only thanks to him that I do not feel ripped off having spent $ 13 on this title. However, had I paid full price, I would see things differently.

It is rather weird: Hudson Music has over the years released some outstanding DVDs. Jojo Mayer's, e.g., is worth every penny. In fact, it is a bargain. This here title pales terribly when compared to ""Secret Weapons ..."". My impression is that Hudson Music is trying to cash in as much as anyhow possible, while drummers are still willing to buy lots and lots of new DVDs. Eventually they'll be fed up & avoid substandard releases, like this one. And Hudson will ruin their reputation along the way.

Another thing that bugged me (and this is nothing but personal taste): every single musician in Blackwell's band is absolutely fantastic on his instrument. How come that they play nothing but horrible muzak-style compositions? I must admit that I did not manage to watch even one complete song on this DVD. Horses for courses, they say. Unfortunately, I wasn't ""strong"" enough to take the muzak.",1356566400,2,1893,4.652694610778443
8304458,5,B001G8MGTS,"Blackwell truly explains and demonstrates how to become a great musician. He demonstrates technique, showmanship, and most importantly, how to play in a group. How to create that groove and not overplay. In fact, he even does just that. He shows what it means to be in the pocket, and what it means to be out-of-pocket. Blackwell also describes his history, how he came around to play with Prince, Justin Timberlake, etc. It's not about showing off, it's about keeping the groove and allowing the band to become more musical. A MUST GET FOR ALL DRUMMERS!!",1278547200,,555,4.791666666666667
8304459,4,B001G8MGTS,"If this is your first masters DVD it isn't really an instruction video in the traditional sence.  The master class DVD's are more centered around performance of the insturment in a band setting.  Loads of info on how to play with people, some licks but mostly how to be a good musician.
This one is a little more performanced based than the Gadd or Sanchez DVD's.  Very good none the less.",1233792000,2,389,4.450704225352113
8304460,5,B001G8MGTS,"This DVD is one of the best drum DVD's out there today. What I love the most about this DVD is John made it clear that this DVD was about getting drummers to playing in the grove/pocket and how important it is for drummers to do that. I also love his stories about his lessions in the industry when he got into trouble for not playing what the song called for. Not only will you enjoy the songs, but you will also enjoy Johns stories and lessions. This is a must have DVD for your connection and you will find yourself watching this DVD many times. I strongly suggest this DVD for every drummer, especially if you're having a hard time with drummers who likes to play all over the place and not in the pocket.",1231718400,5,709,4.220588235294118
