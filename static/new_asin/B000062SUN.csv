 As President of the Mercer County Historical Society, I have just completed the book, ""Passport  to Mercer County, Ohio History; Granville Township, Saint Henry.""  This is an annotated bibliography of publications about history of Saint Henry, in Granville Township, Mercer County.  Publications about Saint Henry's professional athletes are included in this book.  Jim Lachey is one of these athletes.

I have known Jim Lachey and his family because I also live in Saint Henry School District.  Jim Lachey is an honorable and respected person, and I would recommend Jim Lachey's publications to everyone.",1172102400,,865,5.428571428571429
