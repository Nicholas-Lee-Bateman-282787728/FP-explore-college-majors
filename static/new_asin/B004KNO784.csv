4397242,5,B004KNO784,"One of the first things I noticed is the frequent change in the genre of music. First it is gangsta rap, then punk rock, then heavy blues, then finally your metal track. It was not your classic grindhouse soundtrack as the Butcher Brothers sought to do things their own way. There is a 50th birthday party for the Mom of the biker gang ""The Crew."" They get her a couple of female strippers, very thoughtful. Cody's ex-girlfriend Michelle is there with her new bf which she kisses on in front of Cody, a real ""B"" word. She leaves and returns covered in blood. While laying in bed, passed out, one of the bikers decides to ""get her while she is still warm."" Michelle awakens while getting felt up and wants more. She turns into a demon/zombie and bites off a hunk of flesh. The screams attract the rest of the gang. One guy pulls Michelle off the biker and holds her down on the bed, then Michelle's sister Megan comes in and attempts to pull the guy off the monster Michelle.

The events are confusing and the movie waits too long explain what is happening.

Pluses: The bad guy had his own music as he whistled in an off key ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" although it wasn't used again.
The zombie/demon Michelle possessed (pun intended) that certain ""Evil Dead"" quality.
Dead people have a sense of humor.
Home invaders are from the ""1950's.""

Negatives: Not a movie for those who take their films seriously.

Sex, nudity, F-bomb.",1305417600,,1422,4.521400778210117
4397243,4,B004KNO784,"How far will you go for what you want?  After a party a girl named Michelle shows up bloody and dying, after being cared for strange things begin to happen.  When a group shows up for something she has things get worse.  This is a very strange movie that I found myself really liking.  Not much to this movie but sex, beating people up, and a lot of blood.  There are a lot of similar scenes to a variety of different movies in this, too many to name but you will recognize most of them when you watch.  This is not a movie for people who are against violence (but from the title it weeds most of them out), but it is actually a very entertaining movie that kept me interested the entire time.  This is not the kind of movie I usually like, but this was an exception.  Very gory and shocking in some parts, but overall not a bad rental.  I surprisingly give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I might, but not really a definate re-watcher.",1304985600,3,936,4.121546961325967

4397245,1,B004KNO784,"The only Sundance 2010 film I walked out of. A terrible attempt at a grindhouse film that intentionally rips off ""Blue Velvet"" and other films. The guy who introduced the film basically admitted the only reason it was accepted was the directors used to volunteer for the festival. A complete waste of time.",1304899200,6,306,4.7924528301886795
4397246,5,B004KNO784,"I don't think the person that gave this movie 1 star actually understood what he was watching. Ghosts, there were no ghosts in this movie as he claimed and it wasn't a slasher flick or any of the other things that he thought. Ghosts usually walk through walls I thought, at least from my viewing experience they do and are not made up of any kind of solid materials nor do they burst apart when shot and bleed so I'm confused by his criticism. This little gem I will watch many times over. Horror is my genre. This is only the second time that I have really been shocked by a very well thought out and played out story. The first was,'Lars Van Triers, 'Antichrist'. One must learn to watch and read a  movie just like they learn to read a book or they will miss out on some of the greatest book adaptations and complicated screenplays out there. The gentleman that gave it one star doesn't understand this. I believe he would have been much happier spending his night with something like, 'Nightmare on Elm Street'  and what seems like a couple hundred sequels that they made and I believe that he would have given Freddy 5 Stars. There is a huge difference in actuality having to concentrate and read what you are watching and having it spelled out for you. The latter removes all the thrill, especially from being tricked so expertly. I enjoyed this movie almost from the very beginning. The thrill of this ride is that I absolutely believed 1000 percent that I was watching a very certain storyline,THEN BAMB,it punched me right in the nose,took a quick left and I realized that I had been watching something else the entire time. The final scene is both unfathomable and shocking and very scary for those people with broad minds.",1412121600,,1733,4.533546325878595

4397248,3,B004KNO784,"I gotta say I actually ended up liking this movie a little. Firstly because it was not at all what I was expecting. Secondly because it was fairly well acted. Thirdly because it was one wierd movie with some moments of actual originality. I liked the horror/ sci-fi / thriller/ posession/ mind bending mixture of the film. It goes from gory horror to satanic possession to science fiction, then takes a wild left turn and dives into total David Lynch territory. By no means is this a great film or even one you'd be wrong to skip, but if you decide to watch it and don't expect too much it might actually suprise you and be better than your expecting. I enjoyed it for what it was, and might even watch it again, but it's nothing ground breaking.",1367625600,2,746,4.413043478260869
4397249,2,B004KNO784,"This movie had been on my must watch list for ages, I highliy anticipated watching it but I'm sad to say I didn't really go on it and am so glad I hired this instead of buying it outright when it was first released. Seriously, WTF was this movie meant to be about? Part biker, part night of the living dead, part exorcist, part grindhouse, part ET - I could go on!! It had potential for sure, but didn't cut it in the end. On a positive note, I quite liked the people who played Cody, Megan & Shade, it's a shame they had to be in this mix up of a movie to get noticed. If they had left it as a fun grindhouse splatter movie it would have got more stars from me.",1353369600,,662,3.911111111111111
4397250,3,B004KNO784,"What's most irritating about the Violent Kind is the 25 minutes in the beginning that accomplishes nothing of interest.  Just a bunch of young people partying, goofing off, making out, having conversations about nothing important, etc.  We've seen this kind of generic storytelling for years so it's nothing new.  Another annoying aspect is how the enemy just APPEARS with no dramatic or enticing build-up of any sort.

The only really entertaining moment comes when the one woman is covered in blood and acting fishy, so her friends tie her up in the bedroom.  Well one of the perverted guys decides to attempt to take advantage of her while she's in a blood-soaked, oddly peaceful state of mind.  To HIS surprise, she actually likes being touched between the legs.  That's because she's now possessed and ready to rip him a new one!  Shortly after when the other friends are aware what's going on, they slowly walk into the bedroom and approach the demon woman with extreme caution.  Where did she hide?  Not under the bed, not in the closet but... on the ceiling!  Excellent segment.

However it's impossible to overlook the poor acting and storytelling.  The actual demonic figures that appear later are more like badly designed costumes with less than spectacular line deliveries making it feel like you're watching a high school play, and the computer effects that emphasize the demonic presence near the end is totally laughable.  Overall, it has its moments but is mostly a flawed affair.",1337904000,,1496,4.955823293172691
4397251,1,B004KNO784,"Here we have an example of a movie that wasn't quite sure what it wanted to be. Biker flick? Party film? Horror movie? It jumps all over the place and never quite lands on one category or another but tickles each.

A group of bikers are getting together at a secluded farm far out in the country. They party hard and tensions rise when one of the members, Cody, sees his ex Michelle with a new boyfriend. She's a tease and knows it, doing all she can to incite him to violence. Hey maybe that's because he's ""the violent kind"". Hmmm.

So the party drags on for a while and her little sister Megan back from college is there as well. This is the good girl who, for the life of me, I can't figure out why she's at the party. You would think she would be well aware of the type of things that happen at these parties but apparently she is more innocent than can be believed. She has a thing for this Cody and has since she was a teen. Ah young love.

Things turn crazy when Michelle tries to leave later than most guests. Cody, his best friend and his girlfriend and Megan are all that's left but going down the road they come across Michelle and her new beau's car. Michelle has been hurt and the guy is dead. Oh but things get better.

Once back at the house, Michelle becomes possessed by some sort of demon. Trapped in the house with no idea who is the cause of this, the threesome decides to try and escape. The only problem is that it is a group of ghosts from the fifties who have taken over the house and intend to kill each of them.

This group is made up of all sorts of cool cats. Greaser, stylish mod, you name it, the different groups are represented here. And they intend to wreak havoc.  Who will stop them? Who cares! I'm telling you by this point I was so bored and tired of the bad acting, bad photography, bad direction, bad script...nearly bad everything...that I didn't care and didn't want to know. I just wanted it to be over.

The fortunate characters in this film were the ones killed early on in it. Not because they didn't have to be eviscerated or suffer broken limbs but because they didn't have to suffer through the boring rubbish that is called THE VIOLENT KIND.

No heroes, all villains, poor possession, biker wannabes and fifties doo whop do not combine to make a good movie. This film is the proof of that.",1332806400,2,2339,4.264108352144469
4397252,5,B004KNO784,"Okay first off, this is a B movie. It isn't ""Grand Illusion"" or ""Sophies Choice"". But if you are reading this you aren't looking for that, I hope. This movie has your typical gore and violence of any typical 21st century ""splatter"" movie. You have elements here of everything that is synonymous with ""Grindhouse"". Bikers, broads, Rock& Roll, sex, drugs, and a very Cthulluish threat that is pure evil, or is it? There is the twist, truth is good and evil, better keep score. Joe Egender has some of the greatest dialogue in any B move and his delivery, well if this wasn't a Butcher Bros. movie you would have heard more about him. Watch close and you will see, his character is far more than what appears to be.
I walk a fine line here not to spoil this but i will say this, one man's rapture is another's damnation and it all hinges on perspective. This is a great film disguised as a horror flick and a real bargain.",1328313600,6,919,4.380116959064328
4397253,4,B004KNO784,"You cannot dictate to something its nature. Or, as some people say, 'it is what it is.' This does not aspire to some lofty post. It's a biker meets zombie-ish movie. But it's way cool.

Here's the scoop. Bikers Cody, Elroy and Q are headed up to Northern California, and some remote house, to celebrate biker mom's 50th birthday. Both the earlier and newer members of this club are partying hard. But as things thin out weird stuff begins to happen. The sky develops a weird aurora, cell phones go nutso, cars won't start, and Cody's ex-gal turns into some carnivorous thingoid. Next thing you know they are set upon by some retro 50s guys and gals intent on releasing whatever alien thing is residing inside Cody's ex-gal.

I had a really good time watching this movie. I don't know squat about the butcher brothers and had no expectations going in so I was pleasantly surprised. This is not an expensive movie but I felt the money was well spent. I liked the direction. The shots were set up well and the special effects were good enough to get the point across. The writing was decent as well. They didn't just set up the situation and hack their way to the end. The main characters have histories so there's some gravity to the proceedings. The music was pretty good, particularly the 50s rock-a-billy type tunes. The performances were generally decent with the exception of the Vernon. Joe Egender, as Vernon, was outstanding. He reminded me of a thin-faced Giovanni Rabisi. Things ramped up a few notches when he and his friends hit the screen.

There are some hints as to why this is all happening. Vernon and his pals went missing in 1955 and there are some references to Jonas Saulk, the relevance of which I didn't understand. But, again, this isn't just a gory romp. And the ending was as cool as I've ever seen in a movie. Some might say it's nothing more than an open door to a sequel. It is certainly part that but it struck me with much greater impact.

This won't set the world on fire or change your life but, for my time and money, it's a solid entry to the genre.",1324598400,5,2082,4.485488126649076
4397254,1,B004KNO784,"If you like horror movies like me you'd wanna rent this,but its a complete let down and kinda boring and story is awfully dumb. Who ever the butcher brothers are they sure lived up to their name by butchering up this plot to pure crap. The bad guys from the 50's where not scary at all and quite frankly stupid and embarrassing to the decade. The entire flim made no sense and the title screen gives most of the end away. I hope musician les Claypool did NT write the 'lights in the sky'(title screen/ending credits song) for is horrible horror movie. Don't let the Sundance film entry fool you its not even close to living up to those credentials. Do yourself a favor and just pop evil dead or something in the DVD/vhs player instead of wasting time on crap like this.",1309824000,3,769,4.384615384615385

8433160,5,B004KNO784,"Personally i thought this was gonna be a sick & twisted film just based upon the fact that i like films with bikers,parties,drugs & fights. The film is really weird it reminds me of Undead,in the sense of the plot twists. This review has spoilers.
The film starts off with a gang of bikers,a gang leader named Q & his underling Cody(who is brought in thru family ties) and his cousin Shade. They go to Codys mothers house in the middle of nowhere to party with Codys mom for her 50th birthday,loaded with a house full of bikers & partying. The film takes a turn when Codys ex(Tiffany Shepis) is with a rival gang member at the party,and Cody also meets his ex's sister(who worked on writing Cody letters when he was in jail,instead of his gf(Tiffany Shepis) he went to jail for) and as the party dies down things get strange. The girl(Tiffany Shepis) goes to leave the party with her new bf in a ride along the desolate area. Next thing you know the girl shows up covered in blood with no memory of what happened. They take her up to the bedroom to clean her up,1 of the guests takes it upon himself to take advantage of her....bad move on his part,because she wakes up posessed & tears his throat out. The remaining group of people start to fear for their lives & paranoia sets in and questions start to fly. Electrical issues happen and the strange occurances get weirder as the sky turns green & music plays outta nowhere. The girl posessed starts crawling the ceiling & the next thing you know the dead body in the car & the guy who got his throat ripped out wake up in pieces with no memory of anything. Now in the beginning of the film the movie starts with a guy shooting himself in the head(he does not want to help the aliens take over earth) so back to the party,the gang are now barracaded inside the house. A group of ""aliens"" show up in the skin of several people who disappeared,or were abducted in the 50s. They are literally crazy,starting to play sadistic games with Q,Cody,Shade & Tiffany Shepis younger sister. The murders start to unravel and the plot unflods as we find out the aliens are here to incubate their alien in the host body(Tiffany Shepis) because she happened to be in the right place at the wrong time. So they get violent & explain the plans to overthrow the world,they need that alien to grow. So Cody & Shepis younger sis escape,the aliens track em down & pretty much say ""good luck...you're gonna need it"" as the world is now infested with aliens hell bent on destroying the world...because that's all we know is violence.
The movie is rather strange & takes unexpected turns but man is it good,loaded with action(fights,sadistic games,torture) and a pretty unique story. If you like action & violence blended with gore & a strange plot twist then i suggest you get this film. It was very cool & i'm glad i found it. Highly recommended.",1455408000,,2874,4.476190476190476
