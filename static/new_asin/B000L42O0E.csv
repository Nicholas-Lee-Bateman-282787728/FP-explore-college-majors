8160127,5,B000L42O0E,"I used this round table discussion as a discussion anchor on the role of neuroscience in our technological future as well as its role in the context of general psychology. It was effective. This show manages to bring in truly prominent voices on whatever topic is being presented regularly. As well, my students were able to gain some exposure as to how a career in neuroscience research may appear. This was particularly valuable. This DVD was really well done.",1193011200,,462,4.860759493670886
8160128,4,B000L42O0E,"Nobel- Prize Winner Eric Kandel joins Charlie Rose and his co- host another Nobel Prize Winner Paul Nurse in this discussion on the current state of research on the Human Brain. The general feeling which pervaded the discussion is that we are on the verge of major breakthroughs. Kandel said that the most difficult challenge facing Science in the twenty- first century will be understanding the biological basis of the brain's, (and as I take it by implication, the 'mind's) operation. ""Mind is Brain and Brain is Mind"" it seemed to me was the shared assumption of all the panelists. They did not however wax philosophical at all, and were far from any Mind, Brain, Soul discussion. It was all about the research being done in the field.
One of the panelists subject is 'face recognition' and she reported that this seems to be a very specific skill connected to a very specific area in the brain. She told of a patient whose brain was damaged in this one particular area and was alright in every other mental activity, but simply could not recognize faces. Another researcher spoke about the area of the brain involved when human beings are trying to understand what the other person is thinking and feeling.  A third researcher spoke of the
areas of the brain involved in drug addiction.",1192924800,2,1290,4.758928571428571
