The voices are the most annoying I've ever heard (and i was never bothered by watching Barney a million times). Bad acting storyline and I am overall very disappointed in this DVD.",1484611200,,341,4.104477611940299

8390591,5,B0037FMTB8,"This DVD is a great purchase if your kids want to learn about sites of Iran. In the story, the kids travel to many fun places all around Iran. If you are an Iran lover (child or adult) or you are an educational place like a library or a school, this is a great video. Also, I am a huge fan of Maz Jobrani and the music group Abjeez from Iran - so they are both on the DVD and for that reason alone, it's a great purchase. Songs are zippy and Maz does a lot of voices which are hilarious! Also of course good for learning Farsi for those parents who are maybe not Persian but want to learn. You can watch in English and then in Persian and then switch again. It's a great way to learn simple every day words and because Babak is in a home environment, you also learn a lot about Persian Culture. Well done to the producers of this DVD. I was a fan of Babak & Friends and this new Mixed Nutz TV series is a great one for our family!",1344211200,,930,3.925925925925926
