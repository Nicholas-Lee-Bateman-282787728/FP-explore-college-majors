2752395,5,B000FXVFH4,"I can not believe it has been 28 years!!!!! I was maybe 13 years old when my friends and I bootlegged this movie when one could still record off the main movie tracks!!!! I fell in love with this ""Alien"" knock-off movie for two simple reasons:

1. It kept me wanting to see what happened next.
and
2. The shower scene...need I say more???!!!

This movie was ahead of it's time with its play on the bio-engineering scenario. I loved the erotic intensity of the characters and spent many of long evenings with fantasies of the shower scene, the voyeur scene and the sauna scene. I loved the build-up of the creature roaming about making it a hunt for more then just a blood thirsty, brainless monster. It was a powerful play on men and women playing ""God"" with this creation that turns out to be a bit more then they thought it would be. I loved the B-movie play on it because it had more bite then many of these so called A-movies out today. It did not have CGI, it did not have your casual stand-ins for hard to do scenes, and it did not fall into the jittery home-made movie feel. It stood alone on a small budget, a cult following, and some of the most intense erotic sci-fi interactions between both humans and the creation. I am definitely pre-ordering this so it will be on my doorstep for me to expose my own children to something I could never put into words here but left me with lasting impressions for many years. As a writer of paranormal fiction this movie was one of the few to influence my build up on erotic vs. horror intensity. Give it a try, I can saw for the most part it will leave you panting for more, in more ways then one!!",1279065600,57,1647,4.2756410256410255
2752396,4,B000FXVFH4,"Wow, I love this movie from the android made from stormtrooper armor to the real big creature hanging out at Vasquez Rock. If you like Galaxy Of Terror you'll love this bit. To me it was not so much of a B-rate but an A minus rate.",1270598400,16,231,3.9361702127659575
2752397,5,B000FXVFH4,"FORBIDDEN WORLD, 1982, Color, 82 Minutes long.
Starring :  Jessie Vint, Fox Harris, Dawn Dunlap, June Chadwick, 4 more.
Produced by Roger Corman
Directed by Jim Wynorski
FORBIDDEN WORLD Is Also Known As MUTANT, but do not confuse it with the movie MUTANT (1984) starring Wings Hauser and Marc Clement.

FORBIDDEN WORLD is a very rare Sci-Fi movie not available on DVD(in region 1) and hard to find on VHS. (It does exist on DVD in region 2 under the title MUTANT.) It has a great cast of little known but very competent actors. It is a typical Roger Corman/Jim Wynorski film - low budget but very well done. And naturally there are several scenes of nudity.

On planet Xarbia, an elite group of researchers is threatened by ""Subject 20"", a man-eating organism which they accidentily created. Space Marshall Mike Colby (Jessie Vint), the best trouble shooter in the Galaxy, is called in to investigate. During his investigation, he manages to get in a steam bath with naked teenager (19) Dawn Dunlap. Later, Dawn and June Chadwick have a shower scene together. After this, the monster (Subject 20)has gotten so big and ferocious that it starts feeding on the researchers. Time for Mike and his robot sidekick to earn their keep.

Not as slickly made as ALIEN, but if you like Roger Corman movies, this is one of his best. Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a B movie,but it's one of the best. (Fox Harris is a hoot !)
I've seen movies that cost a jillion dollars to make that weren't
nearly as good as this one is.",1184284800,5,1523,4.608856088560886
2752398,3,B000FXVFH4,I love 80's movies and I love Roger Corman. This is a good Corman film. Not great. The flash frame editing in various parts totally detracts from the film. I'm not really sure why they did it but they did. The picture quality is fantastic. The audio is clear. A little hissy on the S's but hey it's a low budget film what do you expect. Random nudity of hot 80's girls is always a plus. The monster is great. The set's are low budget sweetness. The walls are lined with painted styrofoam take out containers and egg cartons. The soundtrack is surprisingly good as well. it's just that editing which makes it a good film and not great. Final thoughts: It's a fun film to watch and I will definitely watch it again.,1483833600,,713,4.3283582089552235
2752399,5,B000FXVFH4,Exactly what I expected from Corman.  He can make a decent low budget movie with D-list actors and cardboard sets that rivals any high budget B movie for quality. The nudity helps. Packaging and delivery time were OK,1482537600,,216,4.684210526315789

2752401,4,B000FXVFH4,"Difficult movie to review.  Plot: Scientists on a far off spaceship create a monster by mistake that gets loose and attacks people.

 Some of the scenes are terrible, very gross & disgusting, and the alien monster is a rip off copy of the alien flick but over all other scenes do work enough to be enjoyable.  We do have some sci fi elements in the film that teens and adults alike might find enjoyable, even if they are very dated and not even close to what modern effects can produce, while the rest of the film ultimately falls into a monster flick.

  Take some elements from ""Star Wars"", and mix them with ""Alien"" and you get a product similar to this one.  Horror scenes mixed with sci fi ""Buck Rogers"" adventure make the film lean toward the range of R to PG-13.  Probably for ages 11 and up, but some scenes are violent and gory when the ugly phony looking creature attacks.  B-/C+",1474156800,,889,4.398773006134969

2752413,4,B000FXVFH4,"I'm fan of some of Roger corman's films, only some
mainly cause his films are extremely low budget which means average storylines/Directing & average acting of course
but the only corman films i like are tolerable to the point where the story is watchable
even thou some of the scenes are very ridiculous mainly cause of the acting
one of these films is Forbidden world which was released as MUTANT in the Theaters 1982
which makes no sense to me, the title change makes no sense to me
when i watch the film i could tell some of the scenes in the film especially the Alien creature which is obviously a rip off
from ridley scott's ALIEN, infact the storyline in Forbidden world is similar to ALIEN
set centuries in the future
A group of scientists/medical officers Discover some type of Alien Lifeform which mutates into an ALIEN being
and then the ALIEN kills the medical officers one by one which is basically the plot
Corman's version is very different from Ridley scott's ALIEN even thou the plot/storyline is similar
there's some Nudity, extreme full frontal nudity of one of female Medical officers
plus a extreme sex scene (soft core porn) between another female medical officer & a male officer
plus blood & Gore aswell when the Alien attacks the officers
i bought this blu-ray out of curiosity really cause i was fan of other corman's films like
PIRANHA, HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, DEATH RACE 2000

anyway when i bought the blu-ray i found out there's 2 versions of the film that shout factory have released
the Theatrical version 77mins which does show the title FORBIDDEN WORLD on the screen
and the Unrated directors cut which shows MUTANT
the Unrated cut has never been officially released goes for about 82mins which is about 4-5mins longer
which shows more Nudity, shows more Graphic sex scene & of course more blood & Gore
the Theatrical cut is obviously tamed a bit for wider audience
i've seen both versions there's a big difference in the sex & blood & Gore in the film that's for certain
it's a matter of opinion really either you like the Unrated version or the Theatrical version or you like both

the Theatrical version is of course 1:85:1 widescreen with a new HD transfer which does look excellent
much clearer & sharper than dvd
however the Unrated cut was not given the same treatment tragically
the Unrated version has only a Digital remaster transfer in 1:33:1 full screen which still looks Good/watchable
on my 2:35:1 widescreen TV the 1:33:1 ratio fills up my screen actually there's no black bars which is usually the case with
playing 1:33:1 ratio film on a 1:85:1-2:35:1 size TV
if the Unrated cut was given a new High definition transfer the picture quality would be alot clearer & sharper
for sure no Doubt about it, tragically the picture quality is only Digital remaster which looks tolerable
pathetic really for some reason shout factory did not give the Unrated cut a High definition transfer, maybe they were lazy
the sound quality is average for both films, only master audio stereo mix has been given which sounds Good but not excellent
shout factory should have given the Theatrical version a 5.1 master audio mix at least
but obviously they didn't make the effort, they spent most of the effort cleaning up the picture quality

there's all new special features aswell
a new retrospective featurette with mainly the production crew and only some of the actors
Producer Roger corman, Director Allan Holtzman, music composer Susan Justin
Actor Jesse vint and some others are also interviewed
there's also a featurette on the Alien creature effects of Forbidden world
special effects artist John Buechler and others are interviewed
there's also poster & stills Gallery, Theatrical trailer
all on 1 blu-ray Disc

time to upgrade and get this new blu-ray version, the picture quality & sound quality is much much better than dvd for sure
4 stars for this new blu-ray version, about 2-3 stars for the film it's self meaning it's an okay ripoff
it's a roger corman production, and sorry to say but not all of his films are Great quality watching.",1428451200,,4081,4.784397163120567
2752414,4,B000FXVFH4,"If you're a sci-fi nut like I am you have a wealth of options when picking a film to watch. You have intellectual sci-fi, mainstream sci-fi, monster movies, space operas... and you have b-movie schlock like Forbidden World. I'm not knocking it! Movies like this are entertaining, funny and enjoyable for sometimes all the wrong reasons, but enjoyable they are. When poorly constructed robots chatter like kids and large garbage bag monsters kill someone with urine you know you're in for a good time on the couch.

Forbidden World is, unashamedly, a rip-off of Alien with that Corman style feel. It's probably the height of Corman's boobs and babes era when it comes to science-fiction films, and the snarky male protagonist hams it up like Ron Jermy too. The ploy starts silly and gets even sillier. The way they finally win is just... well, you have to see it to believe it. All the while you get the cheaply but passionately made effects and sets you know and love and sexy, cheesy and gross moments you crave.

More films should embrace our baser desires and entertain us like this. It's a shame blockbusters like Transformers aren't afraid to be stupid, but are afraid to be raunchy.

The blu ray edition of Forbidden World is rather excellent, if you keep in mind what it is. It's not, for example, 2001 A Space Odyssey. Nor is it Star Wars. It's a fun and trash b-movie from 30+ years ago and it looks it. That said the HD master here is remarkably detailed and clean looking, and Shout Factory have included numerous supplements to entertain you. A great making-of is the highlight, as well as the uncut version on a DVD with director commentary (he's dry but entertaining, lots of stories).

If you like cheesy old sci-fi with a raunchy twist you can't go wrong with Forbidden World. If you collect sci-fi like I do it's a very worthwhile disc as well. Recommended for fans.",1426291200,5,1883,4.662650602409639

2752460,5,B000FXVFH4,"The result of combining Alien, The Thing, a lot of boobage and report card of straight Ds.  But for bad horror entertainment value I give this an A+!  ALTERNATE TITLE:  Mutant, which sounds like a much less appropriate title for the Roger Corman Galaxy of Terror follow-up, but is more appropriate given the actual nature of the movie.

This review is of the unrated Director's Cut, which has a running time of 82 minutes (5 minutes longer than the 77 min for the theatrical version).  I'm guessing that whatever people saw in theaters, this will just be more of that.  As it turns out, in this case, all 5 of those extra unrated minutes are apparently of nudity.

Our story begins with Commander Colby and his robot crewman on a spaceship under attack from some other random spaceship.  With lame effects and nothing at stake; it's no Star Wars Tie-fighter dogfight, that's for sure.  After surviving this brief mess, his robot dishes out the bad news that mission directives are sending him to some planet instead of home.  So they set a course for Xarbia.  Is it me, or do a shocking number of sci-fi movie planets seem to have a ""z"" sound?

Colby travels to an isolated research facility where risky work with genetic engineering is conducted to create a productive new food source for mankind.  Colby meets Dr. Hauser, Dr. Barbara Glaser, Tracy, and a few other people who are hardly introduced--probably because they're going to be the first to die...spoiler alert.  The female researchers are both inordinately hot, dress in sexy pajamas unbefitting of a space station, they both make passes at Colby and, not surprisingly, we see them both naked.  What is surprising is that they made a pass at Colby!  I mean, sure, he has the title Commander and a uniform.  But he's pretty homely-looking as far as space cadets go...

The researchers introduce Colby to one of their experiments: ""Subject 20"", a metamorphic mutant that continuously changes its genetic structure as it develops.  Hauser and his team of scientists are excited about it and think it's wicked awesome, but the no-nonsense Colby just thinks it should be destroyed.  No surprise here, but it turns out Colby was right!

The engineered mutant cocoons itself into a pulsating mess (which actually looks like someone hung a dead facehugger like a Halloween decoration) to transform to its next state--that of a black jellyfish thing--which leaps on some dude's face (again like a facehugger) eats his brain and infects his body with its saliva which keeps the guy alive but brain dead.

The plot plays out a bit like Alien/Aliens (1979/1986) meets The Thing (1981), with members of the crew dying in analogous ways (e.g., the robot, like Bishop, has its torso separated from its lower body).  The monster grows rapidly from a football-sized jellyfish to a toothy-mawed abomination and infected human bodies slowly transform into foamy carrion sludgy undying masses as the creature virally exploits and re-appropriates each cell's function.  When we finally see a full grown monster, it looks like a hybrid of a giant rubber black widow and an Alien xenomorph.

What separates this Roger Corman cult classic from most others is that it actually has a clever plot element.  Whereas the researchers where trying to genetically engineer a productive new food source, Subject 20 (created with the same research) uses its likewise-engineered saliva to synthesize human bodies into protein-farming masses of flesh.  But don't take that to mean that this is at all sophisticated or to be taken seriously.  I mean, two women taking a completely gratuitous shower together discuss communicating with the monster, which they decide to go do bath robes.  This doesn't work out well.  The monster uses its Alien xenomorph-like tail to impale Barbara in typical Corman schlocky form.

The special effects are charming.  The gore is deliciously overdone and super-abundant, the spaceships look abundantly fake, the monsters are cheap but entertaining, and then there's even more gore.  What major sci-fi releases focus on-for example, character development, logical plots driven by character actions, and elaborately staged set pieces-Forbidden World throws right out of the window to give viewers a briskly paced 80-minute grindhouse experience.

That, and when the hero is introduced to the beauty with the 'brains', who happens to know more than anyone else alive about genetic engineering, why he would ask what they do in the labs. Duh. No security (with weapons) in a place that creates things that are ""totally unpredictable"". And as a food source, no less. The acting wasn't as terrible as the script was. That being said, this was also the funniest damned space horror flick I ever saw, that was never actually in space. Totally cheesy porn music queueing in the sex scenes (awesome) and a scene where the black man is apparently playing some kind of instrument that not only just happens to be part of the cheesy porn music, but also really, really looks like he is smoking a bong. Not subtly stereotyping at all. Then there's the continual flash back and forth between gratuitous sex and violent death. Premonition of later in the film? Oh, and fish tanks filled with fish. Wait, here's a thought, why don't we solve the food shortage by eating fish? Nah, too easy, and would be too intelligent a decision to be made by the brightest minds in the galaxy. Instead, let's create a food source that looks like and has the same temperament as Audrey from Little Shop of Horrors. What could go wrong, right? This movie kept me rolling. The hero telling the genetic engineer who created the monster in the first place to find out everything there is to know about it and what makes it tick. Bwahahaha!

On the planet Xarbia, an experimental life-form known as ""Subject 20"" has been created by an elite group of scientists in hopes of preventing a major galactic food crisis. However, instead of prolonging life, Subject 20 is destroying it, and the man-eating organism poses a double threat because it constantly changes its genetic structure. Bounty hunter Mike Colby is called in to investigate but soon suspects that the scientists are keeping something from him, and he discovers why...Subject 20 is half-human!

If that doesn't sound like pure B-Movie fun then I would suggest looking to other films for entertainment and ignore this review completely.

It seems most films these days are out to be as emotionally dramatic as possible all whilst seeking out those lovely Oscars; now films like that are perfectly fine but in a world today full of questionable times and events, turning to a film like this really hits the spot. I saw a trailer for this film online and I had little to no hesitation on shelling out the 18 dollars to have the pleasure of seeing Forbidden World. The movie is basically Roger Corman and company ripping off other films; two obvious franchises that were ""inspiration"" were Alien and Star Wars. What the bigger brother films focus on (Deep character development, logical plot/character actions, and elaborately staged action set pieces etc.) Forbidden World throws right out of the window and gives viewers a rather briskly paced 70-something minute Grindhouse/exploitation film experience.

For a relatively low budget flick the special effects aren't half bad. The intro has a space battle between two ships and is quite impressive for being made way cheaper than the original Star Wars films; though a bigger budget, production and effects team does yield better results. Things are gooey and detailed when need to be; you can't really get much better than practical effects. The set pieces, though not of the highest quality and from what I have read they are recycled from another Roger Corman production ""Galaxy of Terror"", do have charm to them. The acting is what you would expect from a picture like this; it's bad for the most part but you can tell the cast is having fun and as a result it comes back to you the viewer. My personal favorite character is Dr. Cal Timbergen. He hams up the overly passionate scientist image and always has coughing fits yet lights up a cigarette after doing so. I surely laughed more than once at his performance. The hero in this picture, Mike Colby, comes across as a mix between Han Solo and every character Kurt Russell has played. This being an exploitation type movie there is plenty of ""doesn't benefit the narrative of the film at all"" nudity and sex to be had and while it comes across as a soft core porno once or twice it does add to the overall experience. The lead women are honestly quite beautiful (even when fully clothed) and unlike most Hollywood royalty today they look all natural from head to toe, a rarity I know...

 I could go on about the film but I think it's time to what I thought about the overall Blu-Ray package and let you be on your merry.

Like I said I paid roughly $18 (normally costs more) for this Blu-ray combo pack and while you may think spending so much on an old movie is bad here is my rule of thumb on that subject. These movies usually have a cult following, that means they are only appreciated by a select group of folks. There are smaller-independent companies out there that are taking the time and effort restoring these hard to find gems and for their passion and dedication to fans I have no issues spending 20+ dollars to own these types of films if they are handled with love.

Shout Factory is one of those studios that try to give fans as much as possible in terms of content and solid Blu-ray specs and I highly recommend looking them up for more products.

When popping the disk into my player I knew I was going to get a respectable video transfer from the folks at Shout Factory and after watching the movie I was happy with the quality. Forbidden World is presented in 1080p 16x9 aspect ratio and housed on a 25GB Blu-ray disk; any more would have been overkill in my opinion. The movie is never going to look like a brand new production but this transfer is the best it will ever look I feel. I give the video 3.5 out of 5.

The Audio is a hit and miss however. It does what it needs to do to get you through the movie but has a couple issues to boot. The audio is encoded under a DTS-HD MA 2.0 lossless soundtrack which means it won't rock your 5.1 set-up. During one scene in the movie when Dr. Cal Timbergen is talking the audio gets slightly distorted and crackles a little bit as if the master recording was damaged beyond restoration; when this happens some things, for me at least, were hard to make out.  It wasn't a deal breaker and was easy to look (or listen) past. If you can go into this Blu-ray knowing the movie was made on a slim budget and didn't have the best equipment around, you will be satisfied. Audio is 3 out of 5.

I haven't had much time to view the special features but they are there and the couple that I did see were interesting. My favorite is, of course, the brief Interview With Roger Corman. Aside from the special features housed on the Blu-ray the set also comes with a DVD copy of Mutant (another name for Forbidden World) and to make the deal sweeter it is the Directors Cut running at roughly 82 minutes in length. I did pop this in for a few minutes to see what it was like and I must warn you to set your quality expectations to low. Mutant didn't get any restoration and is locked into a 4:3 aspect ratio. To make matters worse (depending on how you look at it) Mutant is a simple port from VHS to DVD, which means you don't even get DVD quality picture. This could sound horrible but it's also fun in some ways because it looks and feels like a true B-movie film instead of being cleaned up and restored for the modern age. From the bonus features that I have seen I give it a 3.5 out of 5.

Also if you own this or look to own it, Shout Factory was nice enough to give the slip cover two sides. The factory shipped side is Forbidden World and if you flip it around it is Mutant. Always cool to have.

I could go on and on about the film, the specs, the quality, and things of the like but I hope this has given you enough information to possibly give Forbidden World a try. This movie could also make for a very interesting experience if you watched it with a group of friends. Don't take the movie serious at all, enjoy it's stupidity, glaring flaws, beautiful women, slimy creatures, poor acting and hopefully you have as much fun as I did watching it.",1375488000,,6782,4.472109943411479
2752466,5,B000FXVFH4,"No, not better than most movies, read on;

This is a 'B' popcorn movie--not Casablanca.  Despite most SF type movies having an over abundance of sluts and cussing and swearing nowadays this one is different.  I didn't realize what it was unit I saw the original directors' version.  I watched the 'remastered' version under this title earlier today.  I have to get up early and wound up staying up all night.  So I put in the other version by the title of Mutant.

It's the writing.  Yep, that's it...it's the writing.  Out of all the crap gollywood produces today and yesteryear Corman actually managed to snag a script written by someone having a clue on how to write dialogue.

When you get this movie I want you to pay close attention to what is said as well as done.  THEN I want you to apply this same 'small' standard to the rest of the SF movies you watch now and yesteryear.  I think you'll understand by the end of the movie why Oldtechno says  ""Most of the movies today are written by HACKS!""

This writer had a clue (albeit a small clue) on how to write dialogue.

So what's that to you? (you might ask yourself)...well, you pay the same price for a movie written by Robert A Heinlein as you do for some nameless HACK.----Isn't it better to at least have a writer with a clue on 'how to write' creative fiction?

2752468,5,B000FXVFH4,"It all started with that one word.... Alien, and now it has come down to its best rip off, two words, Forbidden World! I dug the living hell out of this movie, IMO it was much more entertaining and gruesome that Galaxy of Terror ever was, it also fits more as a rip-off than Galaxy of Terror could've ever wanted to be!

Plot: An easygoing and uncaring man has a new mission on his agenda that involves him going to a scientific lab on a planet to take care of a minor problem, but when he arrives there, that minor problem gradually turns bigger as the time goes on, soon there is a vicious parasite wiping out the entire scientific crew and soon, that easygoing/uncaring man will have to give a damn!

Review: I can't even describe how much fun I had with this movie, with all of its crazy flashy edits, the that annoying screaming girl who has a quite-type voice until she nearly pisses her pants while screaming every time she is in fear (which is a lot), and it's awesome monster, It alone gave way to many more movies like it involving genetic mutations and scientific experiments gone wrong! The special effects were not the only thing awesome in this movie, it was ridiculously cheesy but it also had something I didn't expect.... it had heart, the heart wasn't really put into the special effects but more towards how the characters felt about each other, they were obviously cautious o new faces (somewhat like said in the film), it obviously took very little time for our main hero to adapt but when he did, he managed to fit in making out with one of the chicks and almost making it to second base with the other, the dude's a rabbit I know but he was still fun to watch... not the sexy stuff but I meant his character... oh never mind. I especially found it funny that one of the girl's boyfriends just died and she's off to seducing our hero, ah this movie was gloriously cheesy!

Acting: I had a fun time with these characters, more so than in galaxy of terror. They acted like they were so scarred after one of them was killed but then, at most ten minutes later they act like they never existed. The acting wasn't that great but the characters were totally awesome!

Gore: an immense amount of gory, gruesome and bloody dead bodies, an impalement resulting in massive blood spray from the exit wound which we unfortunately never get to see, lots of blood splatter, a graphic tumor removal scene and plenty more!

Bottom Line: One of the best ""Alien"" rip-offs I've ever scene, it is better than Galaxy of Terror and The Terror Within (which is basically a serious ""Alien"" rip-off) It has everything I was hoping for, to tell you the truth I always thought Galaxy of Terror looked more fun, but now I definitely look more towards putting ""Forbidden World"" on that pedestal.

But in spite of civilization's technical advances, it was still bedeviled by a shortage of decent food for its Galactic citizens.  The Federation was desperate for a solution and believed it may have found one on a remote planet. . . .

Planet Xarbia has a benign orbit around a pair of tranquil stars; it's a harsh planet, but some lifeforms manage to survive on its forbidding surface; one indigenous specimen is prolific with a prodigious rate of growth.  Fortunately, this protozoan is similar to Earth life; perhaps it can be genetically combined with food stocks to create a new, abundant food supply.  A new research facility was commissioned.  The Xarbia research facility was staffed with doctors Hauser, Glaser, and Tinbergen; along with Techs: Brian, Tracy, Jimmy, Earl, and Annie; eight personnel in all.

The first nineteen animal experiments were encouraging, but the twentieth experiment had nothing to do with creating food; its result: mayhem in the biohazard-lab.  Upon receiving the report of the accident, the Federation sent their top troubleshooter.  When Commander Colby arrives to investigate the accident, there were only seven personnel;  whatever happened to Annie? . . .

2752472,4,B000FXVFH4,"A long time ago in a galaxy not very far away, I first saw this movie, Forbidden World. Has it been 30 years already? Back in the year 1982 I used to visit this little movie theater near where I worked every friday evening without fail. They used to run two features back to back for the price of one, and I saw a lot of great movies in those days. Just to name a few that you might have heard about; Escape From New York, The Howling, Mother's Day, Motel Hell, Battle Beyond the Stars, Ice Pirates, John Carpenter's The Thing, Tron...Ah, those were fun times, and that was the place and year that I first saw Forbidden World.

This here strange little movie was Roger Corman's answer to the very popular film ""Alien"", and what a piece of work it is! I don't know why I like this movie so much, but I do? I mean, it's so cheap that it reuses old spaceship battle footage from Corman's Battle Beyond the Stars movie, has spray-painted egg cartons and styrofoam fast food restaurant containers glued to the set walls; it features a lumbering and slow bulky mutant creature that couldn't possibly outrun the Mummy or Frankenstein if it's life depended on it; the mad scientist of the film never wears a protective face mask or rubber gloves when doing bloody genetic experiments; and in one scene, one of the actresses are actually using a glow stick to push buttons on a keypad console! I guess they did that to make it seem more futuristic? But now it's just plain laughable.

And let's not forget the scene where the wall is dressed up with painted packaging bubble wrap! But still, for some odd reason, I just still really enjoy this movie. In fact, all the bad things that I have just described about it, and believe me, there is much more than this to poke fun at in this movie, make it all the more enjoyable to me. It is one of those ""so bad it's good"" kind of films that I find myself watching a lot lately.

Despite all of its shortcomings and low budget zaniness, the movie still manages to convey a pretty good sense of dread, fear, and eeriness in certain spots, particularly due to its synthesized electronic musical score, which really helps to creep you out at just the right spots and maximizes the thrills. Watch it in the dark while alone late at night for maximum effect to see just what I mean.

Forbidden World is a great 80's low budget exploitation film that is loaded with many unintentional laughs and cheap thrills galore. I would have given it a 5 star rating but the movie is just way too short. It really needs to have a good 15 or 20 more minutes of footage added to it.

Like ""Star Crash,"" it is a cheaper version of other films with the same basic premise of an alien creature run amok in a remote space station. The sets are common place, the acting is mediocre, the musical score is average, the special effects are not at all special, and the obligatory nudity scenes are shot through colored filters typical of the era.

As I said in my Galaxy of Terror I bought it with Forbidden World and liked Galaxy a bit more. The problem with Forbidden World was that it looked too much like a low-budget movie which it was (F.Y.I. most of the sets were previously used in Galaxy of Terror and Battle Beyond the Stars and were made from McDonalds hamburger boxes) but other than that I liked it. One thing I did like that before I didn't was the odd electronic themed music. Some highlights of the film include a scene in which the monster (in small blob form fresh out of the cocoon) attacks lab tech Jimmy, a slime-covered Gorden grabbing Tracy's robe with Tracy tugging at her robe until finally yanking it away with the his hand (pulled from his socket) still holding on, a shower scene with Tracy and Dr. Barbara, and the end which I will not spoil for all those who have not seen this film. Special Features include the Director's Cut, which isn't that different from the theatrical version, a commentary with director Alan Holzman on the Director's Cut, a booklet, and a making of... documentary. Completing the DVD is reversible cover art featuring the Forbidden World poster with a giant monster that has nothing to do with the actual film hovering over a scantly clad woman and the Mutant poster with just a photo of the monster with painted McDonalds burger boxes in the backround. 4 stars.",1303516800,,1461,4.644787644787645

But since it's a New World film you know that it'll be done in low budget cost saving way. The fine folks at Shout Factory have done an awesome job restoring the film and adding a 2nd disc with the original uncut version of the film. The wide screen cut of Forbidden World is pristine and the 2nd disc Mutant cut is not as high quality but is 5 minutes longer .All the bases are covered here studly hero(Jesse Vint)check ,mad scientist (Fox Harris) check,sexy female assistants (June Chadwick and Dawn Dunlap) check,Greedy head of research (Linden Childs) check.robot sidekick SAM-104(Don Olivera) check and lastly Mutant space monster aka Subject 20 check. Vint who by the way was great in Macon County Line clearly enjoys himself here. The women are super duper hot and show us the goods so to speak. Dunlap also is an awesome screamer and she has to scream a lot in the film. The Mutant is much better looking than the minute budget should have allowed for. The special effects team lead by John Carl Buechler did and awesome job with no money to play with. First time director Allan Holzman kept the film going and the editing and music are top notch as well. Any fan of low budget cinema like myself will eat up Forbidden World much like Subject 20 was eating up the crew. The ending while utterly stupid is at least cleverly so. If you have 20 day's to shoot and have to recycle sets from other New World films like Galaxy of Terror and use fast food boxes for set pieces I guess we can allow for a silly ending?

I was looking for something campy and old school sci-fi, attributes communicated by the cheesy illustration on this DVD's cover. So I grabbed it....

Man, did this title deliver. It felt like I was watching a movie that couldn't really decide whether it wanted to be a soft-core porn flick or a simple sci-fi exploitation flick. Either way, it never asks to be taken seriously, which oddly enough, is what makes it immensely enjoyable. Everything is just that much over-the-top, but never so far as to ruin the the fun. Gore, nudity, dialogue, it's all gratuitous and often silly. The plot rips pages from sci-fi films left and right, most notably ""Alien"". Then there's that robot that looks just like a stormtrooper and doesn't really play much of an important role....generous nod to star wars or another blatant knock off? Does it really matter?

The rating is for the level of entertainment rather than quality. This is a exercise in silliness done on a shoe string budget, and it makes no bones about it.

Is really unbelievable the team that make the movie could achieve an amazing world without a big studio budget. The sets, wardrobe, effects, props, creatures, makeup and acting are really believable and extremely well achieved.

Then why only 4 stars?
The first DVD is the money worth for, the theatrical version in pristine condition, great image and sound, awesome transfer. Some extras for the fans, mostly interviews to the tech crew (i love it, but some people don't), an interview to the leading actor, director and Roger Corman himself. Pics and art gallery and some trailers for other Corman's movies.
The problem was the lack of behind the camera footage someone would spect (like in Galaxy of Terror DVD) and the awful quality of the second DVD. Ok, is the Director's Cut, 5 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, but without any remastering process. The sound was just ok, but the image was better in a VHS copy in EP speed. If there's a second DVD in a remastered version of a movie I would spect that both copies were new transfers of same quality, specially if we're talking about a Director's Cut, sometimes is no big deal, but the difference is abysmal.

Make yourself a favor and watch the Theatrical version first even if it's 5 minutes shorter, but you're gonna be glad to see this movie at it's best, then if you love it watch the Director's cut. The biggest difference between them is the voice of Sam (the robot), in the theatrical cut with a voice of a woman and the director's cut with a more sci-fi/robotized voice (sometimes without getting a thing of what Sam was saying).

2752486,4,B000FXVFH4,"An intergalactic mercenary is brought to a remote desert world to aid researchers in capturing a an escaped specimen with a constantly-evolving form -- a metamorph. Roger Corman churns out another gruesome Sci-Fi monster movie in the wake of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic ALIEN. FORBIDDEN WORLD makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is a hurried rip-off -- though ALIEN, itself, is an amalgamation of both QUEEN OF BLOOD and PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES. The working-class characters and imitative plot mechanisms are constant reminders of this, but it is the cheap bastardization of H.R. Giger's creature design that is the most obvious. Where the film does begin to differentiate itself is in its sexually-charged characters and gratuitous gore, two traits that would also be exploited in other similarly sleazy ALIEN clones like William Malone's CREATURE or the British INSEMINOID. Despite its penniless production, Corman's crew comes through with more impressive set work, special effect, and miniatures that give the film an incredible scale and a believable futuristic environment. Allan Holzman has accomplished what he set out to achieve by ramping up the bloody carnage and creating a fun and exciting creature feature for 80's Sci-Fi fans to enjoy!

Excellent and well made Sci-fi horror rollercoaster from Roger Corman and New World Pictures! This is a worthy follow-up to the enjoyable B-movie romp Galaxy of Terror. I'd say this surpasses GOT in every way of being more fun but not half as gory despite having some gory moments in this movie. There's also hot nude ladies for the guys out there fully nude from head to toe, a couple of sex scenes, graphic violence, involving story and typical b-movie acting.

2752492,4,B000FXVFH4,"Corman's Galaxy of Terror is usually referred to as a rip-off/cash-in on Alien, but that film has very few similarities with Alien.  Corman's low budget schlocker, Forbidden World definitely fits the Alien rip-off bill much more accurately..
The film involves an intergalactic buttkicker named Colby(Jesse Vint) who's summoned to a science lab on a distant planet to check out an experiment that ""got loose"".  And I'm assuming, to kick it's butt.  Colby arrives at the station to find that ""Subject 20"" as it's called, has escaped, killed all the lab animals and locked itself away in the incubator for a little R&R before it goes on a killing spree.  Colby spends a good amount of his time giving the two, horny and attractive scientist chicks something to study in the after hours.  Meanwhile, Subject 20 finally makes up his mind to leave the incubator on account of some flunky who decides to open the incubator door to get a better look at it when he noticed it started moving.  Now it more or less becomes Alien-Roger Corman's Alien, that is!  That is to say, shameless and cheesy(it ought to be with a character named Colby), with a bunch-O gore and T&A.
Once again, Corman really stretches his dollar.  This film had a smaller budget than Galaxy of Terror, though in some parts it actually looks a bit more slick than Galaxy.  The Making Of.. documentary on the disc provides some interesting insight on how the film was made.  The second disc is the director's cut titled Mutant(a much better title considering the title ""Forbidden World"" doesn't make a lot of sense in the context of the movie).  It's worth a look, though the film didn't get the same slick remastering as the first disc, so it's a bit rough.
All in all, another great Corman disc from Shout Factory.  Makes a good double feature with Galaxy of Terror(especially at about 3 AM).",1281484800,55,1855,4.726708074534161

2752495,4,B000FXVFH4,"Roger Corman has been, without a doubt, the McDonald's of the film world. Like the famous fast food chain, Corman has been the butt of a lot of unkind jokes, but keeps on keeping on, satisfying millions. While the burger giant with the clown has practiced 'fast, cheap and easy', for Corman and crew, it's been 'fast, cheap and sleazy'. A indirect rip-off of 'Alien', the premise is not any more far-fetched, just not as professionally done.

Jesse Vint is an intergallactic bounty hunter-slash-space cowboy who, on his way home, gets ordered to planet Xarbia, where a lab experiment has gone horribly wrong. Subject 20 as its known, has mutated and gone on a rampage.> A side note, something I learned from the 'special features' interview with cast and crew, the dead animals shown in the damaged lab, including cats and dogs, were real. The crew had purchased them (already euthanized and frozen) from a local animal shelter. Creepy!>

The creature continues to grow and mutate, ala cocoon style metamorphosis, each time getting bigger and nastier. The head of the research facility Hauser (Linden Childs) is mysteriously protective of the creature, for a reason that is revealed later. Vint seems almost an afterthought in this, not really much of an action hero. Basically running around spouting tough-sounding lines. But as the body count begins to rise, it's ultimately the sickly, quirky doctor (played wonderfully by Fox Harris) who comes to the rescue with a plan to defeat the monster, but at a terrible price.

Eye candy is amply provided by luscious blonde June Chadwick, who went on to star in the TV series 'V', and Dawn Dunlap, a delectable girl-next-door type, fresh from her role in the French softcore classic 'Laura'. She went on to do another Corman classic, 'Barbarian Queen'. There is one memorable shower scene involving both ladies, with frontal nudity, in which they decide they should try to communicate with the monster. Needless to say, that didn't work out too well.

Special effects are fair, and might even be considered pretty good, taking into account the limited resources and funding that was available (the budget for the entire film was about $1 million). Not a flick for the kids due to the excessive gore and nudity, but certainly a fine 'guilty pleasure' for grown-ups. While I'm still partial to other Corman treats like 'Death Race 2000' and 'Galaxy of Terror', this would be in my top 5 of favorite Roger Corman flicks. This guy could teach a lot to current Hollywood directors on how to make a decent film for far less than what they do. It's ironic that one of Corman's understudies, James Cameron, went on to direct some of the most expensive movies in history (Titanic, The Abyss, Avatar).",1280016000,8,2738,4.894396551724138

An experimental life form kills a bunch of lab animals and is contained in the lab where it spins a cocoon, and begins a transformation.

I don't want to go into the story too much and spoil things for those who haven't seen this gem, so I'll mainly focus on the Blu-Ray quality / extras.

Long out of print on video, and previously available on a crappy (and ridiculously expensive)import DVD, Forbidden World finally gets the re-release it deserves on Blu-Ray!
A perfect mix of horror, sci-fi, gratuitous nudity, monsters and gore -Pure entertainment!

I have wanted to see this movie again for years, and had almost resigned myself to forking out the cash for the import DVD. When I saw that this was finally getting an American Blu-Ray release, I pre-ordered it immediately.

I was shocked at how good this blu ray transfer looked for a film this old! Extremely sharp pictures and vivid colors - I haven't seen this movie for over 25 years, but I don't remember it looking this good. A couple of the darker scenes are a little grainy, but overall a very impressive transfer.

Disc 2 DVD : 'Unrated Director's Cut' (full frame) with commentary by the director.

Picture on the DVD is still pretty great, and it was interesting to see how the additional footage changed the tone of the movie - The restored footage doesn't appear to be more graphic, it mostly adds a bit of comedy to the film.

Shout Factory did a great job on this one - they seem to have put a lot of time and effort into what is arguably an obscure title. With the recent glut of barely upscaled DVD prints being shoveled onto Blu Ray, it's nice to know that some studios are trying to give the fans a worthwhile product - Thanks for giving us something we thought we'd never see.

It is a B movie, but this one is a good one.  Not excellent or satisfactorily erotic in the softcore part of the film, but good enough to watch.  A little bit of T & A to merit the R rating, but the blood and violence more than likely were a higher consideration to make it an R rated film.

You need to like softcore, horror, Sci-Fi, bloody violence, and cheesy cheaply made classic films.  Those two women are very good looking, and they make you wish for a hardcore version.  Not quite enough camera time without artistic special effects getting in the way (dim lighting, double overlay of camera clips, kaleidoscope multi-facet views, and colorizing - all extra distraction and unnecessary) for June Chadwick & Dawn Dunlap nudity scenes.  Typical however for even modern horror films that try to add a little bit of T & A.

The ending of this film made me want to smoke a cigar.  Not because of the softcore scenes, because of the solution the scientist and the troubleshooter came up with.
