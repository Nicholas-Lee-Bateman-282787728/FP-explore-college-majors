8640988,5,B00ID6WWOA,"A fun little movie about a Catholic girl who calls St. Ann a ""Snitcher"" and the St's efforts to make it right. Cute. Grandpa's secret and the neighbor's encroachment. Definitely worth reissue!",1526947200,,192,5.03125

8640990,5,B00ID6WWOA,Great movie for adults as well as young teens. You cannot beat these older movie classics for their story lines and acting.,1417910400,3,123,4.636363636363637
8640991,5,B00ID6WWOA,I remembered the movie from when I was much younger. I have been looking for it for some time. Since I went all through Catholic School it brought back memories of how things used to be. It also showed me how much things have changed and not for the better. The quality isn't all that great but  I am not sure if that's because it's old or a knockoff. It didn't spoil my enjoyment.,1399420800,6,381,4.148648648648648
8640992,5,B00ID6WWOA,"I've been looking for this movie for years, I seen it on TCM late night, I never laughed so hard. It's such a good movie, I wish they would make more like this one, what faith she had, and as she got older others in their community also had faith in her too. Great movie.",1397520000,4,271,3.9454545454545453
