3101469,3,B001320860,"There is something slighty disturbing about watching an extremely attractive young woman with a good voice singing schlager (German/Euro pop) to an audience that looks like they have been paroled for the evening from the local maximum security twilight home for the elderly.  Especially when Helene, in one of her more bizarre costumes, encourages the ageing audience to join in when she sings the Queen anthem ""We will rock you"" !

This is the sort of material that has a very high squirm factor.

Filmed live in Chemnitz, in eastern Germany, in 2008, the stage looks like they spent about $100 on the set, and the band look about as old as the audience.  As for Helene, she obviously has a very successful career in German speaking countries, and for good reason.  As I mentioned before, she has a very good voice and is a real performer - totally relaxed on stage and entering into banter with the audience.

I guess it is a matter of how much cheese you can take, and this DVD provides more that its fair share.  With a running time of 140 minutes (!), sets are broken by animated stars (a man star and a woman star) chatting about Helene (ugh)and some stunningly awful costume changes.  If you think the 'Jetson's' outfit on the DVD cover is dubious, just wait - at one point, a la ABBA, the bottom portion of her gown is ripped away to reveal, yes !, hotpants !

Personally I think she is very attractive and has a great voice - I just wish I was her A & R Manager so I could get her to sing something other than schlager.  I'd also want to sack her wardrobe manager and stage manager.  During one song, the dreadful film clip of the same song was projected onto a large screen stage left - I cringed it was that awful. I haven't seen anything quite as bad for a long time.  Add to this, she not only sings, she dances !  In what one can only think of as an Olympic-style floor routine, Helene spins and flounces around the stage. At this point I had to look away, as I was in fits of laughter.

For those interested, and have the stamina, the songs performed are:

1. Mut zum gefuhl
2. Fantasie hat flugel
3. So nah wie du
4. Das karussell in meinem bauch
5. Von hier bis unendlich
6. Im reigen der gefuhle
7. Mitten im paradies
8. Du hast mein herz beruhrt
9. Ich glaub dir hundert lugen
10. Ich wolle nie erwachsen sein
11. Mi canto de amor (sung by Matthias Sagorski)
12. No tengo dinero (sung by Matthias Sagorski)
13. Einfach reden oder so (duet)
14. Im kartenhaus der traume
15. Wein nicht um mich, argentinien
16. Und ich vermiss dich auch
17. Feuer am horizont
18. Es gibt keinen morgen danach
19. Manchmal kommt die liebe einfach so
20. Ich bin in sibirien geboren
21. Hinter den tranen
22. Power of love
23. Am ende sind wir stark genug
24. Solang dein herz noch fur mich schlagt
25. We will rock you
26. Wo das leben tanzt
27. Du fangst mich auf und lasst mich fliegen
28. Und morgen fruh kuss ich dich wach
29. Ave maria

If you are a fan, this DVD is for you - at 140 minutes of singing, dancing and animated stars, plus an 18 minute documentary, I guess this represents very good value. For me, though, two songs would have been enough. In summary, this concert makes Eurovision look like High Opera !

8248847,5,B001320860,"This concert was performed in 2008 when Helene Fischer was only 23 years old, and was her first major DVD release.  The program consists mostly of German popular and Schlager music.  She also sings several well known songs including;  ""Wein Nicht um Mich Argentinien""( German version of ""Don't Cry for Me Argentinia"" ), ""Power of Love""( sung in English ), ""We Will Rock You""( sung in English ) and ""Ave Maria""( rendered in German ).  Her rendition of ""Ave Maria"" is angelic and illustrates her beautiful voice.  Helene Fischer is an attractive and vivacious performer, and she interacts with the audience several times during the performance.  The instrumental accompaniment is lively and has that ""catchy"" Schlager beat.  Schlager seems to be very popular in Germany, and Helene has become so good at it, that she has become known as the ""Queen of Schlager"".  Helene Fischer's performance in this concert undoubtedly was a significant factor in catapulting her to superstardom in Germany.  Besides her extensive concert tours, she now has her own TV show.  A few more of her live performances have been released on DVD.  'Mut zum Gefuhl' is still my favorite, however.  Some of the instrumental music in her later concerts is a little ""overpowering"" for my tastes.  I should point out that ""Mut zum Gefuhl' is in the European PAL, region 0 configuration.  Most DVD players currently sold in the U.S. are configured for NTSC, region one and will play PAL DVD's very poorly - if at all.  Interestingly, some of the older U.S. DVD players can handle PAL DVD's very well.  There are video converters available which can convert PAL to NTSC.",1391126400,5,1637,4.898181818181818
