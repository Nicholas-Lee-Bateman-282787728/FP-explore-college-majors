This was the best show HBO has ever had and they are nuts for cancelling it. Bring it back HBO i will be a subscriber again.",1149292800,8,263,4.076923076923077
2571748,5,B000FL7C82,"The wildest, wackiest, most inventive series in TV:  stranger than TWIN PEAKS, CARNIVALE has a feel all its own, unlike anything you've seen. It makes a sort of dream-sense, although it would be difficult to try to explain to the uninitiated what it's all about.  I love this young actor, Nick Stahl, who plays Ben Hawkins.  He looks like he walked out of a 1930s postcard, as does Jonesy, Sampson, Sophie and the rest of the carnies (although Adrienne Barbeau looks out of place:  too much plastic surgery perhaps? or not enough?).  That HBO cancelled this series after its second season finale is lamentable.",1148947200,72,610,4.826923076923077

i would not re-subscribe with HBO unless the show was to return; but i will
buy the dvd[s].

please goto [>] savecarnivale.org

isn't it sick that the life gets sucked out of things that should exist by the
quality of the produktion and not the quantity of the viewers.  another
ugly fact ov life in the early 21st century.  anyone responsible for cancelling
this show should be ashamed of themselves.  god forbid anything remains
available on television that doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator.

2571750,5,B000FL7C82,"I first heard of Carnivale from my sister about two years ago.  For her birthday last year I bought her the first season  on DVD, and I was blown away...I literally couldn't tare myself away from the DVD player.  As soon as I finished the twelth episode, I went to the store to find the 'complete second season' only to find out there was none.  I ended up buying homemade DVD's made off of a TIVo player, and was absolutely spellbound by the unwinding of the story.  After watching it two times over, and finding out HBO let the show go for good, I became a Carny Junkie.  The chess pieces are all set in place but I'll never see the execution of what should have been at least 3 more seasons.  I will Buy the DVD's because they are as precious as good books...you may know the story but you'll want to revisit from time to time.",1148169600,10,830,4.215189873417722
2571751,5,B000FL7C82,"If you are tired of empty-headed-no-brainer-fluff television, then welcome!  Carnivale is completely addictive and equally enthralling --you'll soon find yourself watching each episode over and over again so that you can discover some little tidbit or twist that you didn't see before, and can plug into the puzzle.  The symbolism is fascinating, and it is amazing how the story lines are all entwined.  The characters, sets, costumes and plot twists give the series the feeling of being both real and surreal at the same time.  Any series that can gather such an enormous following and keep the fan's passion alive after being cut off at it's cliff-hanger (shame on you HBO)is worth every penny that you'll spend on it.  One bit of advice tho-don't try and pick this one up beginning at Season 2.  You'll need to watch Season 1 to get familiar with everybody.",1147824000,11,860,4.896551724137931
2571752,5,B000FL7C82,"The ending of this second season opened up so many doors: hello! Sofie the ultimate evil carrying the ultimate good's baby, perhaps!  It had all the mystery and excitement of a moody X-Files, but HBO did not want to pursue this show to its end, just leave us wanting for more.

If I could wave a magic wand and bring this show back into existence, I would.

I loved this show, I addicted so many of my friends to this show to where they subscribed to HBO, but after aforesaid network decided to give it the axe (how long was that horrible Arl$ss on the air?) we cancelled our subscriptions to HBO and have not returned to watch any of their new shows.",1147737600,14,651,4.276422764227642
2571753,5,B000FL7C82,"Season two of this amazing series saw a shift in gears as far as the direction of the show. Season one, while a masterpiece, suffered critical hits for taking too long to develop, and thus, perhaps lost some viewership. The not-so-well-kept secret is that time it took to craft the characters is exactly what true fans of the series enjoyed.

Some of the deep mystery and magic is gone from the second season, in favor of moving the plot along, but series creator Dan Knauf was so adept at his craft that he never allowed the series to become ho-hum and typical like other network series that delve into fantasy and science fiction.

What ultimately killed this series was two-fold. 1. It lost viewers who didn't want to be bothered with trying to figure the mystery out instead of having it handed to them on a platter and 2. executives who lost their vision as to what the show stood for and didn't recognize the art for what it was.

This show has created a cult following matched by few others in it's genre. True fans who cry out for more while keeping the vision alive in our minds. Hopefully one day our wishes will be fulfilled, but until then we have memories and two excellant seasons to enjoy.",1147737600,215,1204,4.488584474885845
2571754,5,B000FL7C82,"I really enjoyed this show and unfortunately they kind of left it at a cliffhanger. I will buy this 2nd season as I have the first season to complete it. DVD Box sets have given rise to at least a movie to complete some series. so I hope if HBO does decent with the sales, they decide to do something, but I won't hold my breath on that account.",1147737600,11,345,4.0144927536231885
2571755,5,B000FL7C82,It's about time this came out to dvd and it's sad that such an incredible show got cut off so that over-rated pieces of garbage like Deadwood and the Sopranos could keep going. This is definitely a first day buy.,1147478400,15,212,4.325
2571826,5,B000FL7C82,This really is a very good series. I watched part of it when it initially aired and glad I finally had the chance to binge watch the whole thing. Classic good vs evil with a twist. It is a dark series so be prepared for that. It's a shame they did not continue beyond 2 seasons. I would disregard the one star ratings and give it a chance.,1517443200,,339,4.0
2571827,5,B000FL7C82,really surprised at how good this was.  i wouldn't recommend watching it though.  I was already hooked when I realized it was canceled after season 2.  Still a good show if you can put up with a meh ending,1516492800,,205,4.205128205128205
2571828,5,B000FL7C82,"How did i not know this show existed? Awesome story line, acting, characters, everything! It reminded me of The Leftovers, but it aired 13 years ago! Maybe it was created before its time. loved it!",1515628800,,197,4.6571428571428575
2571829,2,B000FL7C82,"When a show is based on a ridiculous premise, the writers can only do so much with it.  From the beginning in season one, it was clear that Carnivale was based upon some bizarre twisting of Christianity.  Season one was saved from the worst of the cheezy plot line by decent character development and a fascinating view into the 'carney' lifestyle.  There were real moments of brilliance between certain characters that I wish the writers would have allowed to develop more fully- for example, between Sophie and Ben, between Rita Sue and her husband and between Libby and Samson.  I loved how Michael Anderson's role as Samson had nothing to do with him being a small person.  I am so glad to see how he and Peter Drinklage are getting roles in which they play regular people.  Their conditions aren't ignored, but they aren't intrinsic to the role.  What really sinks Carnivale is the stupidity of the underlying story.  Eventually, it had to come out- and in the middle of Season two, it did, thus ruining the show.  Basically, the idea is that Jesus and Satan are no more than special humans, fighting a basic good & evil fight since the dawn of man.  Jesus isn't God's Son.  They are both unique humans with powers- oh, and they have 'blue blood'. (analogy anyone?)  They are locked in a cyclical fight that seems to be passed on through their genetics.  They don't die completely because they are reincarnated into their progeny somehow.  But their progeny doesn't realize it until the parent is about to die.  That's about when they get an inkling, through visions and signs about who they are and what their jobs are- ie, to spread good or evil- and to try to kill the other.  Why the carnival?  Who knows?  The entire show is a mockery of Christ and Christianity.  At one point toward the end, Samson, the carnival boss, actually says that Christ's death is meaningless and that he should have come off the cross when he was taunted to come down and protect himself.  He says that this would have been a better use of his time and that people like Jesus and Ben (note that both of them are of the same 'blood' in this numbingly stupid tale) just didn't know how to do the 'harder thing of living'.  And of course, Satan is the Pastor in this show.  This show also makes a mockery of Americans and American History.  It shows Americans to be highly ignorant, ugly, and woefully dirty at all times, even in church.  If you watch this series, it will sicken you to see so many unwashed bodies in one place.  Ben wears the same dirty clothes the entire show- never taking a bath, apparently.  I hate to tell the writers, but Americans were the hardest working people in the world and yes, we sweated a lot, but we always bathed and dressed in our nicest clothes when we went out after work.  Especially when we went to church.  And we haven't been stupid masses that simply followed whatever preacher that spouted evil from his mouth, no matter how far it strayed from true Bible teachings.  This show started out with some small interest, but came to a slow crawl in the first third of Season One.  It began to meander very quickly with nowhere to go. That's about when it began the T&A shows (even including a gratuitous crotch shot of a teenager).  Throw in a little lesbianism, horrible mocking of Christians and Americana and they thought it would be a hit.  Luckily for all of us, no one bothered to watch it, despite the high reviews some people gave it here.  It was cut off for Season three as I knew it would be.  Useless, boring show.",1515110400,,3550,4.512539184952978
2571830,4,B000FL7C82,"Interesting show, well developed characters, etc.  Probably a bit dark for some.  Finale fell short for me.  Reminds me of a soap where someone dies but the writers hope to be able to recycle the character by writing them back into the show years later.  I feel it would have been better with a ""hard finish"" & a new agonist/antagonist relationship if the series were picked up again later (which would make sense in the context of cycles and generations).",1514073600,,456,4.6625

If I'd known that after 2 seasons we'd end up right where we started I wouldn't have bothered. What the hell is the point- that the struggle between good and evil is never-ending? Maybe so, but I like PLOTS to have an ending. And I'm sick and tired of protagonists becoming antagonists!",1512259200,,375,4.529411764705882
2571834,3,B000FL7C82,"I usually don't comment on things...especially programming i watch. But I simply had to with this one. This show is really good. The twists and turns , and long episodes (time frame and season length) make it binge worthy. But he's the flipside.. .Do not watch if u had shows that don't end. This one does not, and I hate that. The writes knew this was coming to an end and still didn't make a conclusion that provides enough closure. I'll probably never watch this again, simply for that; I'm spending hours of  my life watching, for what?  To be caught in a loop?! Perhaps they did this hoping in the future if would be picked back up. Wishful thinking. Write for now, in the future anything can be dug up and renewed scripted...now more 10 years later  ...nothing. This should have been titled, never ending story: carnivale",1512172800,,827,4.574324324324325

2571857,5,B000FL7C82,"Absolutely amazing series.  A totally different kind of pace and look than anything I've ever seen -- something like Flannery O'Connor meets Stephen King meets Isabel Allende (magic realism, that is).  It's dark, deep, and not always easy to watch -- they're lives are so hard, there're a lot of truly frightening images, and there's an awful lot of misery going on, but it's all so expertly done, and never gratuitous. I've never seen a modern piece do this period as perfectly - music, costumes, language, lighting, acting, everything.  I've seen a lot of complaints here about the story not ending well, not really being a series finale... I suppose that's true, in its way - who knows what went on behind the scenes, when they knew they were cancelled, how they thought the best way to wrap it up might be, etc., we'll never really know.  But if it is the finale, well - evil lives on, good lives on, and the implication is the battle between the two rages on forever.  It's poetic and haunting and well worth the watch.",1511049600,3,1024,4.604395604395604
2571858,4,B000FL7C82,"A rich tapestry of bizarre, offbeat characters from The Professor to Lila and Samson, people just trying to survive during the Great Depression.  Very well acted by some no-name actors.  Do not understand why many of them did not go on to more successful careers; especially Cynthia Ettinger, Clea Duvall, Carla Gallo, and Tim DeKay.

Season 1 was great but it slowed a bit during early to mid Season 2.  However, Season 2 episodes 10 and 11 set the finale up perfectly, building suspense of a multifaceted climactic battle to come.

The finale was very disappointing and was not credible to me...  The climatic battle between good and evil was poorly written,  poorly shot and poorly directed!

Reminds me of a bit of Penny Dreadful, an extraordinarily well done series, where the series was cancelled beforehand and the un-motivated writers had to truncate the plot.

But the series is worth watching, nonetheless!",1510444800,2,916,4.973684210526316

2571876,3,B000FL7C82,"I wish I hadn't started watching it, even tho I liked it.  The season 2 finale isn't really a series finale; there were more seasons planned, and they de-resolved the main thing that they had resolved and opened up something new.  So, this ride doesn't quite wrap up or have a real story arc, it's just moving through this universe. Acting and cinematography were great, pacing was mostly great, characters were interesting but the ones who were meaningful to moving things forward ended up pointlessly wasted.  So, very interesting and engrossing show and characters that don't wrap up -- it just quits.",1506729600,,604,4.901960784313726

Their histories unfold through the episodes very much like in a Stephen King novel. The acting was great with several top names. Clancy Brown played is so good at being bad just like in the first ""Highlander"" movie. When one episode was done, I just couldn't stop watching because I wanted to know what was coming next. Just like a good book, the suspense and unfolding story kept me in suspense. So entertaining. I hope there is a Season 3.

The characters are so well developed you couldn't help but invest your emotions in  them.  I just hated the rushed storyline and open ending of the 2nd season.  The rush of the 2nd season I knew later was due to the series  being canceled.  When I watched the series when HBO first aired it I loved the series and was crushed when it was canceled.  After watching the series again I felt the exact same way. I really did enjoy this series it is probably the best series that HBO ever aired.  Since HBO canceled the season 2yrs in,  I have yet to continually watch a HBO series untill it runs in full.  I don't care to watch many series but when I find one I like to invest time in I am hesitant.  Now I just wait till the series comes out on a streaming service.",1483747200,4,900,4.229411764705882

The first season started strong, but they must have been told early on that the show wouldn't  last. Meatloaf's daughter was cut after just a couple of episodes. Second season, once the mysterious ""management"" is revealed, you know it can only go downhill. I think that it could have lasted several more seasons where they encounter more serious aberrations in different strange towns. Maybe people couldn't deal with the true nature of ""Brother Justin"" and the possibly incestuous relationship with his sister.

Season Two was just good enough to keep me going just so I can see how it ends. Knowing that there is no more, is the only reason I'm finishing out the series. Season two was confusing because of the constant change of background characters and too many plot threads that either were never followed up on or just randomly inserted with little explanation. The acting was generally good but counter to most HBO shows, there weren't nearly as many b00bs in season two. Some may love it but I was mostly ""Meh"".",1476576000,,629,4.478260869565218

Clancy Brown , one of the most underrated actors in the business, once again shows us that he can hold his own,even surpass, Hollywood's top performers. The same can be said for Amy Madigan. All in all a fine, fine series that was over much to soon!!",1476230400,2,382,4.2465753424657535

2572352,3,B000FL7C82,"Season 2 felt more rushed into production to finish up the series by focusing almost too much on the reverend's dark gift & preaching to the riffraff. I liked how the movie gave some background stories for ben Hawkins, Justin Crowe and Henry scudder but fell flat at the ending when Ben kills Justin but when softie discovers who and what she can do by bringing Justin back to life it leaves the viewer to wonder what happens next and the story between good and evil just gets dropped",1475193600,,484,4.449438202247191

2572378,5,B000FL7C82,My only disappointment with this show is that HBO canceled it and didn't have Season 13. I really think this show was better than the Carnival in American Horror Story and can't figure why more people didn't get into this show. My guess is when it came out it was a little before the times. I really think they should do a Season 13. The writers are very creative and well written. It's a tragedy to see a good show go to waste!,1474502400,,428,4.168674698795181

This is definitely a show to watch if you like to get an idea of carny life  and see the different talents and ways they found them..more focused on the unknown mystical and weird than a documentary..so if you want a documentary..this is not it but if you just love watching strange and weird..this is a great show!!

2572413,5,B000FL7C82,Loved this  dark drama when it came out in 2004. Was sorry there was only two seasons. Was glad to see it on Prime so I could watch it again. Mystifying and a bit disturbing at times but leaves you wanting to binge watch to see what happens next. Really depicts how things were coming out of the dust bowl and during the depression.

2572483,5,B000FL7C82,I really liked it and that's saying something considering mondern tv shows have no substance and lack imagination. I just wish they  would have kept to the time a little better there were a few things that didn't fit in the 30's but they did a pretty good job anyway. I like the whole carnivale twist on god and evil and the anti christ...sure wish someone would pick this seris back up.,1471564800,,387,4.375

2572636,5,B000FL7C82,"I never watched this series when it first aired, but just found it on the On Demand for FiOS. There were a few episodes missing from Season 1 and the last 4 missing from Season 2 when Frontier took over and they still don't have their On Demand right.  Sooo...that's why I got the DVD. It is too bad they didn't continue this series because it was the most unusual series ever made. There's nothing like it. Watching the DVD ""extras"" explains a lot more than the writers assume you understand from watching it. Excellent series. I wish it would come back to continue where they left us hanging!

2572663,5,B000FL7C82,"It is very rare that I see a tv program or movie more than once, but I've watched Carnivale at least three times now. There is enough complexity and variety in the story line to feel fresh after five years have passed and you've forgotten all of the details. I also found it to be visually stunning, from rich sets to interesting costumes to beautiful landscapes. It is fantasy, but is firmly planted in a reality that is both compelling and convincing. Yes, some of the acting performances are a little flat. But there are others that are so good that you can overlook those that are weak.",1465862400,,590,4.472222222222222

I'm so upset that shows like this and Joss Whedon's, Firefly, that have drama, good acting, depth to the characters, plot development, and so much more to offer an audience, are always gone within a season or two.  I so desperately want to know what happens to Sophie, and Ben.  Was she pregnant from them having sex, was she able to heal Brother Justin.  Does Ben make it back and have to kill them both, and what about Jonesy, I was really starting to fall in love with his character.  I mean he married a prostitute and does right by her, treats her like a real lady, and he was so happy after Ben healed him. So many questions and no damn answers!",1463529600,3,780,4.243243243243243

I loved the characters and their struggles.  You would also see their life as it unfolded, not just in their story, but in their clothing and how they were all sweating and often dirty .. I know that sounds weird, but plenty of shows clean up their actors and this show just left everything raw and destitute.

My jaw dropped when a beloved character was killed in the last episode, but I suppose there will always be good and evil in the world .. as portrayed in this series.",1462406400,2,633,4.384615384615385

He made it possible to feel the character's emotions throughout the series.  I almost didn't bother investing the time to watch only two seasons knowing it was canceled but it was worth it.  I wish HBO would have given the series a chance to finish its intended six seasons or at least end the story in a way to satisfy its followers. It would have been incredible!

Gives a sense of what the depression was like, and makes me realize how far we have come from the days when people who were physically different were often resigned to making  a living by being in freak shows to be gawked at.

2573281,4,B000FL7C82,"The Carnivale Series intrigued me. The story is definitely about the balance between good vs evil and there is a gray zone, where the viewer tries to make up his mind what he/she is dealing with. You will find demons, seers and ghostly encounters. There is quite a bit of nudity, sex and bad language, too. I found quite a bit of humor woven into the script. I don't want to spoil anything for new viewers but answering some former reviews: If you don't get the movie, you don't understand it, or you haven't been paying attention! The explanation about what is happening is given in mostly small clues spread out during the length of the series. It is up to the viewer to piece the puzzle together along the way; then the ending will also make sense. - One odd thing though, it seems as if the series were filmed exclusively in SoCal, and that the set always moved around in the same area.",1453593600,3,890,4.4

My only wish is HBO's greed didn't run so deep they won't even sell the book rights back to Knauf to finish the story. They have enjoyed steady DVD sales though for 12 years, making a "" expensive show "" into a nice financial gain. If only Netflix were around back then.

Lousy end to what was overall a decent show.  They should have wrapped it up if they knew they were on the fence for a 3rd season.

2573486,5,B000FL7C82,Carnivale is a deep multi-layered story reminiscent of Lost but with much more purpose. It is a slow burn that takes time to build so patience is necessary.

The second season really lags out of the gate and then picks up more and more towards the disappointing end.

The problem with great storytelling is that it takes time to develop, and HBO (and the viewers) didn't give it the time.  Seasons 3+ would have been great.  It's definitely worth watching, though.  Don't be afraid to start a show with only two seasons - fearing it will leave you unfulfilled.

Amazon, you should pick up the series before Netflix does!  Season two was faster paced and way more full of action than season one. Many more plot twists.

Season 2 BLEW MY MIND! It went where I wanted it to go and then some. It took the story to a dark and twisted place that all falls together over the course of the second season. You truly get to see the fruition of the investment you made in these characters, in season one, come to life in season 2.  A gratifying experience. Very well done. High praise for this series.

2574272,5,B000FL7C82,"I loved this series so much, I added it to my highly elite personal collection! I have since watched both season one and two of ""Carnivale"" atleast three or four times each! This story is so engrossing, you will never forget it and never want it to end!
  The writing is so rich and vivid, every character so multi-layered ~ like a good book you can't put down and stay up all night reading just to see what happens next! From the very first scene in season one's first episode to the very last scene in season two's final episode, this series grips you with mystery, history, and the bizarre, as well as an exceptionally well drawn collage of characters with their own secrets to tell. I especially enjoy the spiritual side of this intriguing story that keeps you guessing what these seemingly ordinary people are truly capable of, and just who is truly good and truly evil.
  ""Carnivale"" deserved multiple awards for writing and acting. The ENTIRE CAST gave exceptional performances, which is so rare!
If you haven't watched it, you are missing out!!! I only wish they brought this series back!!!",1433462400,,1098,4.6735751295336785
2574273,5,B000FL7C82,"If you saw my review on the first season, let me say that the only thing that could top it was this, the second season.  We get deeper into the characters, and add in a few more.  The plot advances at a very nice pace, and thickens better and better the deeper into the season you go.  As with the first season, the sets, scripts, acting, editing, and music are all fantastic.  Though one difference with this season is that it was not certain actors that attracted me but having watched the first season that did.  Without providing any spoilers, I will just say that the stories of Ben and Justin come together in this season, as expected, but with some rather unexpected twists.  My only complaint about the second season is that it was the last...I liked this show so much I wish it could have continued on...but it had a great ending and wrap up.  So, again, this is just as highly recommended as the first season...which, if you have not watched you really need to before watching the second season for context.  Enjoy!",1433030400,,1025,4.473118279569892

It didn't have the tension the first season did, but it had more visual effects and more gore--neither which impress me in watching a tale. The themes of good versus evil and blurring lines between life and death were actually getting tiresome by the end of the season. And these are universal and compelling themes!

The effects range from good to amateur and the story would be interesting if there was a reasonable end to it. Can I fault a show for not getting a third season? Yeah I think I can especially if they can't tie up anything. Too many questions left at the end and most of them were in the last five minutes.,1427328000,3,380,4.148648648648648

The acting continued to be amazing, but the storyline went off into the weeds somewhere. It was depressing, sad, and in my opinion, unnecessary. I was shocked and very disheartened by the end. It still haunts me. Maybe that's what the writers/directors were hoping - at least their project will stay in my mind for a very long time. It's definitely not one of those watch-it-and-forget-it films.",1427328000,,526,4.791208791208791

2574611,5,B000FL7C82,"This is a fusion of gritty (pun not intended) realism during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression with a fantasy mythology in the background. The mythology/fantasy is a dark, desperate one closer to the original Brothers Grimm than children's fairy tales. That mythology governs and guides the story arc and the destiny of the characters, but it's not explained up front, only slipped to you in tantalizing bits and pieces. That frequent 'not knowing what's going on' helps you identify with the characters, who have even less of an idea of who they are and what their destiny is. Most of the characters are struggling to deal with normal human challenges, especially relationships and protecting those whom one cares for, while other characters are dealing with 'bigger picture' issues and conflict coming from afar. It's a storytelling that you have to pay attention all of the time.

The production values are equal to a feature movie",1427241600,,935,4.993589743589744

Also loved the cinematography (while bleak, really supports the ambiance,) music and costumes. It has elements of the fantastical and period drama, which are intertwined very effectively.

The period costumes are amazing as are the vehicles, the buildings, etc. The story line is slow in places, but for me that's all the more time to absorb the stunning visuals and period sets. It's not as slow as Twin Peaks was, indeed Twin Peaks was at a standstill for many episodes and left me bored. Although slow, Carnivale does have a pace and movement that indicates a resolution to various issues is coming.

Yes, it is a little slow in places and I am sure I will disappointed when I come to the end of season II, about 2.5 episodes away. It will have still have been worth the watch and this series will stick with me for a long time.

It made you feel like you were back in the 30's.  The suspense builds so beautifully, that you  can't wait to see the next episode.  The only downfall is that it should have been continued as many other viewers have commented on.  The ending leaves you hanging in mid air and wondering.

I love a show that takes chances and while this one only got 2 seasons all 24 episodes were out of this world.

2574843,5,B000FL7C82,"This is by far one of the best shows I have ever seen. I would love to see more like this. I highly recommend this show to anyone wanting to immerse themselves in a fantastical story.

Like others have previously said, the actors are incredible and I also wish it had not been cancelled. I only recognized a few actors; Michael J. Anderson, whom I loved in Twin Peaks, Clancy Brown who i had no idea had been in so many of my favorite shows, from American Dad, Gargoyles, The Clone Wars, Avatar, Legend of Korra, Spongebob to some of my favorite films like Buckaroo Banzai and Highlander! I also recognized Carla Gallo from another show I enjoy, Bones.

I cannot express how much I like this incredible story. Others have commented that this type of story has been done before, but I have never seen or read anything like this. I am glad that I got a chance to see something this interesting, even if it was not the entire story. Both seasons were intense and had me on the edge of my seat.

2574856,5,B000FL7C82,"There is ample evidence that we are presently inhabiting a golden age of television production. I have just completed episode 12, season 2 of Carnivle. Clearly, the series is only establishing itself at this point. The primary quality metrics I employ are (1) how much do I think about the program when I'm not watching it? (2) How high has it moved up on my list of free-time priorities? and (3) How much do I care about the characters and how events develop? On these three metrics, Carnivle ranks as (1) a constant daily companion in my thoughts; (2) the most important thing I do in my free time; and (3) introducing me to characters I am only starting to know, want to stay with much longer, and get to know much, much better. May I add that something magical must have happened at this programs auditions? Every character/actor match was inspired. I know that the characterization unique has frequently been applied to this series, and it is an appropriate choice. I can think of no other program that has (1) captured and developed the era of the dustbowl; (2) delved into the world of an itinerant, socially marginal subculture and brought it to life; (3) developed a unique (allegorical) mythology that says something authentic about our actual nature as humans; (4) left me thinking long afterwards about the themes explored by each episode; (5) so gloriously revelled in the magic and mystery of human differences and uniqueness; and, perhaps above all, (6) inspired me with regards to the importance and possibly lasting significance of the moral and spiritual struggles of daily life. If I were to fall into a small fortune tomorrow, I would consider using it to develop Carnivles seasons 3-6, as had originally been planned for this series. Bring it back? Carnivle still lives. Somewhere out there, it is real, even now. Id sure like to bring it back to the screen.",1420848000,15,1879,4.7846153846153845

I could see this show being done in the same format as a season of ""Dexter"" where there is a major antagonist (in this case, Brother Justin) who is, eventually, brought down and another one emerges the following season.

Some scenes were actually repulsive to me but, the whole thing was kind of like watching Joe Cocker (may he R.I.P.) perform; his movements were weird and spastic and he did not have the best voice in the world but he was just fascinating to watch.  This is a series that I could have binged watched.  If you liked season one, season will not let you down--it was tantalizing.",1419897600,,696,4.5

It's dark, eerie, delves into the supernatural, and is just a little disturbing.  Not sure how I feel about the series finale.

I found a great Wikipedia for the show that totally cleared up my questions. And then the next episode I watched pretty much explained it all anyway. It absolutely left me wanting more. I can't believe that they didn't continue into a third season. Some parts moved kinda slow but by the end of this second season it really had some momentum.,1416182400,,502,4.467391304347826

2575229,5,B000FL7C82,"The Director or producer or who knows started taking short cuts in the second season, making a rich story less rich and a bit jumpy, relying more on cultural icons to fill in the gaps than letting the story tell itself, yet it is no where near as flat as most American television shows tend to be directed.  The acting is incomparable, the story and plot engrossing, and there is nothing like it anywhere in popular television OR movies that ties the traditional struggle between good and evil to actual cultural events.  Most storywriters and  media presenters only deal with that subject hands-off, keeping it in pure fantasy so as not to rise making any social commentary or creating a theme of any relevancy beyond entertainment.  There are exceptions.  Carnivale is one of them.  Yet, we see the meddling of media pushers squeezing the life blood out of a good thing, and Season 2 is witness to this.  Watch it because it is still superb despite the director and producers.  Watch it for the actors.  Watch it for the story that will be dropped as too unsettling as it nears connecting the lines in the backdrop of Depression era poverty, the rise of evangelicalism, political party influence, an emerging social conscience in America, and a permanent working class struggle.  Both the preacher, the politicians, and the Carnivale use truth and deception to manipulate people from their money and personal power, but in Season 2, we begin to see a family bond between the carnival staff that goes beyond self centeredness to include others, and it is this that allows them to experience and survive the Depression very differently than the others.  That, itself, is worth watching.  Place this in the context of twist and turns of relationships with oneself and the discovery of many hidden secrets from such self, and we have Carnivale.  It is a perfect story.  Exceptionally well written, acted, i do say produced in its authenticity which they did leave in, and still mesmerizing to watch.",1414972800,,1997,4.852507374631268

2575294,5,B000FL7C82,"What an absolute Jewel of a mini- series I stumbled upon. The music score, casting, directing, editing, screen play , script, movie sets, actors ect.  all meld into a masterpiece, that I haven't seen in a many a decade. I'm not sure what my review can add to this ,there are other reviews that are maybe more eloquent and detailed than mine. I'll agree with others that the character/plot  building in the first season, that maybe first appeared long and tedious, but I implore you to stick with it to the end of season 2. I think to truly enjoy this series ,that you have to DE-PROGRAM yourself from the modern movie making of today's shock value of CG animation special effects, gratuitous perverted sex, explosions, car chases, wholesale gore and violence being carried out by a self- anointed, over paid superstar, who can't act. I suggest, maybe not binge watching , but watch it every 4-5 days apart to truly absorb what's going on. The portrayal of all the actors, camera angle and panning, music, simplistic sets, collectively come together and draw you in, before you know it, to complement each other ,in true story telling. This series definitely leaves you craving for more, answers just enough for it to be thought provoking and to be missed. I would put this in the class of Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Sterling and other story tellers, that lure you in with mystery, true acting, emotion, and music , before you know it.",1413849600,,1429,4.712

Nick Stahl, however, gives an absolutely flawless performance every time. He's really grown into his talent.

2575387,5,B000FL7C82,"What a cast of characters! A brilliant age old idea of good vs. evil. I had not seen this work of series until recently and was entertained to say the least. A brutal vision of the depression era, carnival folk scraping by, the belittled oakies, chooch girls working on their feet and backs. Using the premise of the ""wolf in shepherds clothing"" was a superb touch. Too bad it had such a short run",1412553600,,397,4.378378378378378

2575405,5,B000FL7C82,"I loved this show when it first came out. It's bittersweet that it's free on Amazon Prime now for the simple fact that it is cool to watch this season, but it becomes a let down because HBO canceled the next 4 seasons after Season 2. The 2nd Season is when everything started escalating and starts to really grab the attention. Unfortunately, there is no season 3 and there is no closure at all in season 2. The writing, acting and story-line are great till the end though. Great Show!",1412294400,,485,4.4

If it just cuts it off I'm gonna be mad cause seems every good show is getting canceled and not finished! I really like this show! It is set back in older days and the characters seem very real. Like everyday real people not perfect.  Of course you have a few unusual ones as well that's what's expected. It is entertaining and mysterious, makes you follow two stories that seem to not relate at all at first but as the show progresses to season 2 it shows more how the stories will cross. It is a show that is great to keep your mind on strange mystery rather then reality of my life for an hour! Always a plus",1412121600,,720,4.027972027972028

 The lack of four letter words alone is worth 4 stars. I am a retired person and I cannot understand why the good shows get one or two seasons and some of the worst usually silliness mixed with stupid content go on forever.
 HBO has put out some of the best. Why do they cut off their very best. Carnival is just one that this has happen too. When I select a series to watch I look for the amount of season it ran, I know if it's only one or two I will most likely enjoy it.",1411171200,,726,4.253623188405797

The story lines eventually became riddled with twists and turns that lead to disappointing conclusions. Apocalyptic  revelations with convoluted under currents became disappointing dead ends. The series is worth watching for certain. I was left with the sense that much was left on the table here. The haunting nature of the plot and the stark locations and sets are the winner here. Your imagination will be stirred and agitated. You will not be bored. I could not connect with any of the characters. Just when you start to connect to a character, he/she will do something to disappoint or anger you to point of dislike. The series entertained me, but left me pondering...

If you want to know what is going on at all times, this one is not for you. I think it is well done--a work of art, really. The imagery is stunning, the characters are compelling.

2575676,2,B000FL7C82,"Sadly disappointing end to a convoluted but promising effort.  The story and plot had enough loose ends to weave a living room rug.

Naturally there are those who enjoy flights of fancy, but this one never really gets off the ground.  The writers equip the chief protagonists with doomsday powers, but the final battle of ""good"" and ""'evil"" winds up with a poorly scripted knife fight after a desultory slog through a wet cornfield.  Seriously?!  I mean... this was the Lord of Darkness and the White Prince in combat for control of the world.

And somewhere along the way everybody starts having visions at will that portend who-knows-what because their significance is never fleshed out.

Technically the period scenes are beautifully done, but even a casual observer will notice that the caravan of Carnivale vehicles usually consists of one or two trucks, a couple of trailers for living quarters and a few additional vehicles.  Yet somehow in Season 2 when you view the carnival midway, it's large enough to do credit to a state fair.

In any case, it's obvious that the writers either planned--or hoped for--at least one additional season to gracefully weave the story back together. But HBO chopped the series with all the finesse of a meat cleaver, ultimately  leaving the story in shambles.

The struggle between good and evil itself isn't new; what's new here is the original and thought-provoking ways I was forced to see the battle between the elements of light and dark.

The scenery, cloths, and the settings from the 30's were all in such great detail.  Enjoyed the plot twists and the different characters.  It is the most enjoyable program I have seen in a long time, right up there with ""Rome"".  Why did they stop after only two seasons??.  All those unanswered questions.  We are so in love with Ben who remains pure of spirit while fighting the forces of evil.  So what happens to him and Sofie???? I am watching it now for the 3rd time.

Because of a couple of sudden switches in character arcs done more in the service of plot than character, in m opinion, this doesn't reach the same heights as the top dramas (Sopranos, Wire, Shield, etc.).

2575764,4,B000FL7C82,"I enjoyed this series immensely . Brilliant acting, especially from Michael J. Anderson as Sampson was unfortunately undercut by a  patchy plot and a weak protagonist (Nick Stahl as Ben Hawkins) whose character became as stale as the dirty shirt he wore for the whole shebang. He goes through a fantastic series of mishaps including being buried alive, but seems to be the same emotionally stunted fellow at the end as when we first meet him( I guess I wanted to see him change a bit). Sets,sound,and costumes were brilliant . Much attention was paid to historical accuracy. I can see why it missed the mark for the third season, though. If the momentum and character development of the first few episodes were sustained,we would still be watching it........",1407628800,,758,4.875968992248062

2575795,3,B000FL7C82,"Season 2 was better than season 1 - reduced cast for one and less sex/skin, more plot development.  The general idea behind the show, of good vs evil, was alright but seemed they were more interested in making a porn flick.  Overall if they had left out 99% of the sex/skin shows and put more emphasis on developing the main story we probably would have had more than 2 seasons.",1407024000,,378,4.385714285714286
2575796,5,B000FL7C82,"As I said on the season 1 review, this is a very dark, creepy series. If that's what you're looking for, you have found it. It worked its way into my dreams and I lived a sort of nether life watching it. On the brightest summer day, I was still thinking of the previous night's episodes.

The characters are rich, complex and engaging. There are many surprises throughout. You can feel the heat of the Dust Bowl and there's grit in your mouth from the almost constant winds blowing dirt and sand. You may be spooked by the dark, too.

It's a damned shame they didn't get a season 3, and most likely they found out too late to really wrap up the various characters' story arcs, so I made up my own ending. This isn't the first time.

Here is how I ended The Wizard of Oz in my mind: Dorothy awakens in Kansas, in her bed, and it's back to B&W. Her bummer Aunt Em and everyone else insist she never went anywhere, that they were by her bedside the whole time she thinks she was in Oz.

She keeps saying, ""But it was so real!"" but she's weak and confused. Then they decide to take her out to sit on the porch and get some fresh air. As they pull away her blankets, the entire room turns a brilliant ruby red, and on her feet?
The ruby slippers, of course.",1406937600,,1252,4.139917695473251

Production value and cinematography are hauntingly atmospheric, leaving the viewer with a lasting impression of a magically dusty world of carny mysteries, destructive religious hypocrisy, and the sustaining power of divine intervention.

My one complaint is that Amazon does not have working subtitles for this season.  The rich Jeff Beal music is mixed dynamically, like a feature film.  That leaves some of the quieter dialogue scenes to cause a scramble for the remote volume control.  If the subtitles would work, the show would be more enjoyable.",1406246400,,499,4.811764705882353

A carnivale context provides abundant opportunity for interesting character development, and the supporting cast, overall, is excellent, especially ""Samson,"" the Carnivale leader.  The plot, however, is unnecessarily recondite, and the lead actors, especially Ben, simply cannot convey nuances expected of these characters.  Season One is better than Season Two, which drags, particularly toward the end.  Overall, I would relegate this to the ""If nothing else is on, then this series is not a complete waste of time"" category.  It has its moments, but then it has many ""nonmoments"" as well.",1405382400,,613,5.619565217391305

Imagine our complete shock to find the package empty!!  We were stunned as this has never happened before....to either one of us.  Episodes 7-9 and 10-12 are present & accounted for but alas, the package was totally empty for Disc 2, episodes 4, 5 & 6.

The mythology however is deeply enthralling, expanding on the hints dropped in Season 1 and really making this show worth the investment.  Some say things get a bit slow (even boring) at times if you're not able to just enjoy the character interactions as the show highlights the everyday monotony and difficulty of Carnies in the dustbowl.  Daniel Knauf does this job specatularly, bringing to life the tense and awkward moments between a family of necessity with jarringly different personalities, with tremendous acting from Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown in the primary roles squaring off throughout the series.",1404172800,2,849,5.086330935251799

I  seldom, almost never, watch anything a second time.  This series was an exception, and for good reason. The writing is very original and deep in symbolism. It does move forward at a leisurely pace, but always entertaining with the gritty reality of the time & lifestyle.  You'll feel like you are living among the folks at the carnivale.  Characters are well developed with many mythological archtypes.  I have mulled over this series in my head many times since it's first airing.

2576040,3,B000FL7C82,"I just finished watching both seasons of Carnival and I'm happy to report it was worth the time as this slow moving road trip finally reaches its destination.
It was refreshing to see a show based in part on the depression and on a traveling stranger than strange carnival troupe made up of some odd characters. Some of the characters are likeable while others you could do without.
The story is based on good Vs evil with the preacher Brother Justin Crowe ( Clancy Brown) being a servant of the evil and the stray cat picked up by the carnival Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) as the servant of ???. The story does have many religious referances throughout, but it's done in a way as to not be off putting to those who don't enjoy religion themed stories.
The vehicle (pun intended) for the story is a traveling carnival that has a mysterious manager running the operation that both the viewer and the members of the carnival know little about  and most have never seen.
The carnivals supervisor is Samson (Michael J. Anderson) who passes orders from ""management"" to the carnies along with the professor Ernst Lodz (Patrick Bauchau) are the only two members of the troupe that have contact with the management. This exclusive relationship with the two men along with the strange orders is a constant irritant to many in the troupe and plays a major role in the story.
The show has many...many layers to it with all of the cast playing into the story/plot and sub plot and might leave some a little lost at time, but on the plus side the characters are very well developed.
For me it moves a little to slow and I would lose my attention and focus or I would nod off.
I don't know if the show was originally going to last only two seasons or not, but the way it ends made me believe that two seasons wasn't enough for the way the story playes out with Sofie (Clea DuVail)?
Good story overall, but a bit slow and could be confusing to some with all the sub plots/characters. The story has a fair amount of semi graphic violence and contains many...many nude scenes (dancing, stripping and or sex scenes) and lets not forget the foul language including the f...word. There is a lot of religious references throughout the story for those who may be turned off, but again it wasn't in an off putting manner. 3+ stars.",1401753600,,2304,4.511961722488039
2576041,5,B000FL7C82,"How can this many years pass without a single cable channel ordering a third season of this show?

One of the major complaints, frankly the only one, that you hear about this show is that it moves too slow.  I don't even accept that as a valid premise for a complaint.  I think, collectively, we television consumers have proven that we are willing and able to invest the time and mental energy necessary for experiencing great storytelling.  I'm not even going to bother naming the myriad television successes that proves this.

The writers of this show created a unique wonderment of a world for us to explore with them.  A world filled with interesting characters that we were only beginning to know.  The acting was simply superb.  Nick Stahl and Clea Duvall in particular brought a ""realness"" to Ben and Sophie.  The kind of ""realness"" that would cause someone, upon seeing Nick or Clea, to immediately think,""Hey, there's Ben. I know him.  Hey, there's Sophie.  I know that gypsy woman.""

I simply don't understand why AMC or A&E or Fx  isn't knocking down doors to try to resurrect this series, or even HBO admitting they made a terrible mistake in light of a more informed expectation of success.  If they're going to cancel everything that doesn't pull Soprano numbers then there isn't going to be anything but snow to watch on HBO.  They must understand that by this time.

Do yourself a favor and enjoy the two seasons of this wonderful story that we were allowed access to.  You won't be disappointed.",1401753600,,1513,4.713740458015267

We just finished watching Season 2 and were so sorry that the series had no closure for its audience.  You can google the 2013 article which is an interview with the show's creator titled ""Daniel Knauf Tells Us Of His Plan for The End of Carnivale.""

2576056,4,B000FL7C82,"<<<<SPOILERS AHEAD>>>>>>

I loved the first season. The first episode of the second season made me sick. How do two people in a raging fire walk out unscathed? I thought they died now - POOF! - here they are again. It went downhill from there for me so I didn't think I would even finish watching it. The changes in relationships and characters just didn't make sense to me. The weirdness just got a bit too weird. I hung in there and at the end, I am glad I did. I got it.

The last 3 episodes of the season cruise swiftly to a peak of suspense and end gloriously. I wish the last moments were different (deleted) but it feels finished. There were twists, turns, and surprises. It always remained interesting.

I didn't give it 5 stars because of the slow, weird start and because there are problems with the plot. It doesn't make sense that Ben would suddenly be able to drain health and life from Justin when he wasn't able to know for sure where the energy/life would come from before. It doesn't make sense that Sofie, a neophyte, would be able to bring Justin back to life using the corn when Justin couldn't do that for Ruthie. It doesn't make sense that Jonesy would suddenly fall in love with Libby- lust, yes. Love, no. How does a guy who had a stroke shoot a gun when he doesn't have control enough to feed himself? It's all good. Whatever. It doesn't ruin it, just makes it less than perfect.",1393027200,,1404,4.351145038167939

They do tie the story line up fairly well at the end. I just wish there were a season three. There was more this show could have explored. All in all, I recommend it.",1392076800,,305,3.935483870967742
2576058,4,B000FL7C82,"This product arrived quickly and undamaged.  This was the second one we received.  The first one arrived damaged, but Amazon shipped out its replacement immediately and it arrived within 2 business days.  We were very happy with Amazon's willingness and speed at resolving this problem.

Basically, the following review is the same review we presented for the first season via it holds true on every level with the first season.

As for the series itself.  It is a vey good series that makes you feel for the characters.  Furthermore, you can relate to many of these characters and the way they act just on the bases of time period the story alone.  There is strong religious aspects that are significantly twisted and thus anyone who might be offended by such should avoid this series.  In addition, there is ""a lot"" of nudity, sexually content/terminology, and occasional swearing which is unfortunatebut again, a bit realistic for the time and situations the characters exist in.  We understand why nudity was added, but feel it could have been cleaned up a bit, thus the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  Those aspects were most likely dirtied up just for HBO's purposes.  However, the story is interesting and enjoyable to watch.  Especially without commercials on this DVD set. It is a shame HBO cancelled the series.  However, it is easy to goggle this topic and you can find Daniel Knauf's (series creator) vision of how he wanted to end the series and discover what characters should have developed into.  We are not sure if the website we are listing will ever change, but as of now the website presenting this concluding information is: [...]

As mentioned, this series does have nudity, sexually content/terminology, and swearing, so we do not recommend it to anyone that can be offended by such.  However, if you can look past all of that, the story does present an interesting chain of events that dwells into the historically accurate struggle of humanity during the times of the dust bowl and mythical aspects of how there is always a battle between good (the light) and evil (the dark).

We hope this review helped.  We tried to keep it vague to not ruin the story for anyone wishing to experience it for the first time.",1391040000,3,2242,4.776623376623377

2576071,5,B000FL7C82,"Still after watching it many years later for the second time still the most original and amazing show.

Viewers didn't like the show because it required thought and everything wasn't handed to them on a platter saying ""Hey!  This is what this means!""  Because of that the viewers did not watch it and complained that it was ""too slow.""  It was originally planned for six seasons so the creator guided the plot or story for that duration of time.  When the second season came around (from what I have read) the writer/creator knew there would not be a third season and was forced to cram everything and anything he could into the second season.  This is why the first season is considered to be too slow by some and the second season seems to zip by.  But the viewers are mainly to blame because if the numbers were up then HBO would not have cancelled it.

It's such a shame the way thought and creativity and just getting destroyed every day.  We the people are to blame.  We basically decide what's good and bad by the numbers.

Take a look at all of the popular shows that are on TV now and it pretty much gives you the answer as to how much thought or originality is involved.  Even as much as I loved ""Lost"" it just dragged on and on forever.  And because I'm an idiot I kept watching it until the end (I felt like I was half way in the forest)  Some shows don't know when to stop.

Of course this show isn't for everyone and if you don't like it that is totally fine.  We all don't like everything.  But it just really bothers me when people say they didn't like it because of reasons that show their lack of intelligence.",1374883200,,1628,4.285245901639344

2576102,4,B000FL7C82,"Carnivale was a fantastic show which had been intended for 6 seasons but was cut down to just 2. With this in mind, I can forgive the rushed pace of the second half of the second season. The creators managed to muscle through a really involved story in just a handful of episodes, and kudos to them. However, I knocked a star off of an otherwise perfect rating because of how forcibly anticlimactic some of these episodes were. The forgivable rush to bring the story to an end made certain scenes far less satisfying than viewers had spent all of season 1 expecting.

Season 2 takes a band of characters you think you know pretty well, and continues to feed you new personality traits that only make sense once season 1 is under your belt. Their behavior is believable and usually forgivable. You watch the characters drift apart, and tie right back together again. You watch broken human relationships find new ground, while other prospects are left behind. You watch parts of the background come full circle, and the moment of realization is chilling. At last Ben Hawkins has a personality behind his wary (and weary), open-mouthed stare. At last, Jonesy gets a break. At last, Sophie gets a wake-up call. At last, the strange wickedness of Brother Justin's church is constantly out in the open. Everything comes crashing down, and while Michael J. Anderson's sub-par acting continues to dampen a few great moments, it remains one of the best shows I've ever seen on television. I was sad to finish Season 2.",1355011200,2,1510,4.741444866920152

Fortunately, the second season marked the end of the first 'book' of the series (the initial plan being that there would be six seasons divided into three 'books') and as such there is a definite payoff for viewers who have invested their time in watching the show. The overall storyline running through the first two seasons concludes and there's a sense of closure by the time it ends. It's definitely not an ending to the series proper (it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger) but you won't feel ripped off either. You will, however, want to curse the executives at HBO.

The second season finds Ben and Brother Justin embracing their respective destinies in the battle between good and evil. Both men are told that they must find Ben's elusive father Henry Scudder; Justin must slay him to gain the full measures of his powers, whereas Ben has to find him to discover the identity of his nemesis and thus avert the coming apocalypse. It's only a matter of time before both sides come to a head. Meanwhile Sofie struggles to find her place in the world after tragedy strikes, the Dreifuss family run into a series of problems and Iris finds her past actions coming back to bite her. Needless to say, there's a lot going on here.

I gave the first season five stars, but I gave the second one four. I wasn't sure what rating to give it. In some ways, this season is stronger. For starters, the second season is considerably more faster-paced and streamlined than the first season. A lot happens in the second season, probably more than anyone expected. There are a number of revelations and events here that if you were to ask me before the season started that, given the pacing of the first season, I would have guessed would have occurred a couple years down the line. Just imagine if in Lost, Jacob and the Man in Black were introduced in the second season and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about. There's a much greater sense of how deep the mythology to the show is; if this much is covered in the first two seasons, imagine what could have happened in the next four? Additionally, the supporting characters are given more to do this time around. In particular Sofie has a much bigger role than she did in the first season and Clea DuVall really gets a chance to shine. As expected, pretty much everyone involved gives a great performance and the quality of the show's production is always top notch.

Unfortunately, the season is weaker in some fundamental areas as well. Most of these come from HBO's executive meddling but the show is still impacted either way. The biggest issue is Justin's characterization. In the first season, he was easily the most compelling and tragic character on the show as he was fundamentally a good man struggling with his inner nature. While the first season ended with him effectively realizing that he was destined to be evil, it was clear he was still conflicted. From the start of the second season, he's essentially a full-blown villain.  This is largely HBO's fault as they were uncomfortable with the ambiguity present in the first season. Clancy Brown still give a great performance (one of the season's best scenes comes from him) but he was far more interesting in the first season. In some other areas, I found the latter episodes to be a bit rushed as they moved towards its conclusion. In particular, one significant plotline that was built up since the first season is given a rather anticlimactic send-off.

Despite HBO treating the series like a redheaded stepchild, they still managed to give the series a quality DVD presentation. The series looks and sounds as good as the format will allow (this would look great in high definition). The extras are also improved from last season's set. We once again get three commentaries, but this time Knauf and co. are joined by one of three actors for each one; Nick Stahl, Clea DuVall and Clancy Brown. Their inclusion adds a lot and they make for some interesting and lively discussions. In terms of featurettes, whereas the last season had your standard EPK fluff, the second season has about an hour's worth of footage to peruse. First up is some footage from Museum of Television & Radio's William S. Paley Television Festival in which the cast and crew answer questions. There's a bit of sad irony here as Knauf and co. are under the impression that HBO is dedicated to sticking with the show to the ""bitter end"". Of special note is ""Magic and Myth"", a half-hour documentary on the show's mythology. There's some interesting information here, some of which viewers may have missed from the show.

Despite some caveats, the second season of Carnivale is still a must-see. It's sad that we'll never get to see the series get its proper conclusion but at least we had two great seasons.",1328572800,3,5010,4.69283276450512

NO ONE else could have done his role in Carnivale not at all!
The first season was the best and the second season did gave so much answers to the questions but they knew they were cancelling and so it all was just rushed. Its a shame that it ended it was a great story/plot/whatever but than again it makes sense that they didn't let it continue cuz of other producers and writers tastes and blah blah but if you think about it, how can this kind of story about good and bad really end?? there is no ending and will never will be and I think thats what they were getting at with the ending as well.

2576122,5,B000FL7C82,"This is the best series I've ever seen.  Well, actually it is on a par with another HBO product, ""Rome"".  Both of these are extremely rich visually and focus on ""under-pinning"" levels of society, rather than the upper echelons that usually comprise the subject of most histories.

I have few illusions that, had I lived during either of those time periods, I would be in any school textbooks today.  So, I found it very engrossing to see the spectacle of Carnivale play out.  I found it odd that HBO decided to cancel this show rather than pursuing the renewal of those aspects that made the first season so successful.

All in all, this is well worth the watch.  The final episode doesn't tie all the loose strings together; however, the story line is left at an interesting point that doesn't make you feel you have been deprived of the ending the authors intended.",1303344000,4,867,4.627450980392157

A mysterious show about a Carnivale wandering through the South and Western US during the Dust Bowl Depression era is perfect setting for a confrontation between good and evil, Christ and Devil.  Nick Stahl plays the young Christ-like figure who can heal people for a price and Clea Duvall turns out to be closer to the Devil part of the family.  If some have complained that they don't know what is going on, well no one is quite sure and that was part of the fun.  Like a Hall of Mirrors, it is confusing and mysterious and what you think might turn out to be false in the end.  A great cast with amazing direction and production values, HBO allowed this show two seasons and there could have been many more.

The language is appropriate and the feeling of the 30s is very real, the story line holds well together. If there is a drawback, then that is that it suffers from the same problem as that of Deadwood, they both end leaving you with a void of wondering what next? - There is no next!

2576133,3,B000FL7C82,"I've watched the entire first season of this and most of the second (last) season.  And I still don't have a clue as to what is happening, what has happened, or where this is going.

There are two venues:  the carnival and the preacher.  So far they have nothing to do with each other.  Let's take these separately.

The carnival is about the sleaziest mud show on record.  The wagons have paint peeling.  The vehicles are rattletraps.  The ferris wheel and merry-go-round appear to lack minimum maintenance and are thus dangerous.  The denizens of this traveling show look as if they haven't had baths in months.  Their clothes are sweat stained and filthy, for the most part.  There are cooch dancers, a sword swallower, a lizard skinned man, a tarot card reader, a little person who may or may not be the boss, etc.  It is 1934, in the middle of the Great Depression and in the middle of America's dust bowl.

The story is vague and mysterious.  A young man, who has just buried his mother, is virtually shanghaied by the carnival.  It appears that he has escaped from jail (he has on handcuffs).  It also seems that he has the power to heal broken bones, etc. immediately and that he is seeking his father (I don't see why).

The preacher and his sister also travel around and there are plans to have a large ministry, perhaps even to become a radio preacher.
Sometimes he is crazy and at times you might even think he is evil incarnate.  His escapades take up about 30% of the show, I would estimate.

The acting is fine.  The atmosphere is fine.  The writing is fine.  I just don't get it.  A plot shouldn't take this long to unfold, and I can see why this collapsed.  Apparently the writers just didn't know where to go next.  Something has to happen in fiction.  There has to be movement in the plot.  This appears to be just a slice or two slices of life, and that's not good enough.

LATER  OK, I've now seen every episode of Carnivale, and it still is vague and not worth the effort.  I don't like paranormal explanations for seemingly realistic events, and I don't like the vague references to Avatars or Knights Templar or other esoterica.

I realize that this series was never finished, but it's obvious why:  people quit watching because the story wasn't going anywhere.  I patiently expected some great revelation, but it never came.

The cinematography was excellent.  So were the sets.  The acting was fine in every respect.  It's the plot that caused the problems.  I am aware that there are those who understood it or pretended to understand it and were disdainful of those of us who were willing to point out that ""the emperor had no clothes.""",1274313600,6,2664,4.540084388185654

Though there are only 2 seasons of Carnivale (originally there were supposed to be 5 or 6 seasons), what exists is top notch with regard to just about every aspect of the show.  The writing is phennomenal - almost too good, which may explain why the HBO series only lasted 2 seasons and was cancelled just when things were getting interesting.  Considering a lot of the drivel currently being aired, I wonder if Carnivale simply went over the heads of many viewers.  Another possibility is that Carnivale doesn't adhere to the typical social morals and so other viewers may have found it too critical of certain religious or societal taboos.

Set in the great depression in the dustbowl of middle America, the story involves the classic struggle between good and evil, though nothing and no one are what they seem.  We are introduced to the characters of Carnivale - a traveling carnival replete with freak show, cooch show and whores with hearts of gold - and as the series unfolds over the existing 2 seasons, the viewer may be called upon to examine his/her own beliefs about the roles of good and evil, light and dark, and all the places in between.  How much of what we believe is really true, and how much is simply what we have been taught to believe?

The sets and locations for Carnivale are unparalleled and create a mood of desperation, mystery and the human instinct for survival even under the worst conditions.  There's a lot of mysticism and good character development throughout.  The only flaw with Carnivale is that it ends without conclusion due to the cancellation by HBO.  There was a brief campaign by fans to revive the series, but to my knowledge, it ended without results.  Unfortunate, since the show is intelligent, thought-provoking, and haunting in a way that leaves the viewer contemplating the world of Carnivale long after the DVD has been put back in its little plastic case.

2576153,5,B000FL7C82,"It's a shame that this great epic was dropped by HBO after they promised ""see it to the end"". If the CBS network would think about it, this would be a great show to follow ""The Ghost Whisperer"". You could even overlap the plots. ""The Ghost Whisperer"" could find some antique tarot cards that once belonged to Appolonia The Fortune teller.  Appy's ghost could visit Melinda, ""The Ghost Whisperer"" and ask her to save her daughter.  Melinda could then do the research and discover how Appy died and search for Sophia via a spooky time travel episode. This would set up the ""Carnivale"" for a Season Three finale. All the fans of this show want to know: (1) Did Jonesy die after Sophia shot him? (2) Did Ben get another shot at killing The Preacher?(3) Is Sophia pregnant with Ben's child? If so, does this make the child half devil and half angel? (4) If Sophia healed The Preacher how does this make her the Omega/Usher? (5) Does Iris get to stab Brother Justin like her vision showed? (6) And what happens to Samson and the rest of the Carnies?
If CBS doesn't bite I suggest that The CW could use ""Carnivale"" as a show to follow ""Supernatural"". Same type of viewer for both shows. Or maybe the SciFi Channel or Showtime. Heck even AMC would be great. This would be a good addition to the original programming they have already, i.e. ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Mad Men"".

Set in the dirty thirties with a travelling carnivale reminiscent of Barnum and Bailey but creepier. You get the feel for the times with the poverty in the dustbowl, I almost felt dusty after watching. The person who did the casting for this was great! The character of Ben is strange yet compelling, the parallels to prophets in many religions would ne more apparent to someone who knows the stories better than I (being interested in religious mythology be not enough to study the bible). Brother Justin is well crafted and seems conflicted as to whether he is good or evil, I think evil is winning with a push from his seemingly more evil sister (she may turn out to not be so evil if they make another season). My favorite character, Sophie, is horribly changed in the end of season two, Why is there no season three!!????? The battle needs to continue. It is hard to review giving details without ruining the show for any interested viewers. Any one interested in less than mainstream programming with a well crafted story that sucks you in and makes you feel like you are there, this is for you.

However, the second season left me quite disappointed. Not only did it become increasingly, gratuitiously gory, but the plot thinned considerably. And the final episode? How was Ben suddenly able to choose who he wanted to take life from? One of the biggest problems he faced throughout Season 1 and Season 2 was that he had trouble directing the siponing of energy to one specific person. Remember how he made Libby leave when he was taking energy from the vultures to save Jonsey? If he had the power to choose the vultures over Libby, then why did he make her leave?

Also, I felt like the writters decision to make Sofie evil at the end was a weak attempt at giving the final epoisode a clever twist. If she was at risk for becoming evil because her father was evil, then why wasn't Ben faced with the same challenge since his father was the ""usher""? I resent having spent so many hours watching a show that destroys the most well-developed and likable characters at the end in an disjointed battle between good and evil where evil essentially prevails.",1213315200,9,1184,4.775609756097561

Finally I shall say rent the first few episodes and if you hate them don't continue.

2576168,5,B000FL7C82,"I finished Deadwood, The Wire (well, still need to see season 5), and 6 Feet Under.  All great shows and all HBO.  Deadwood left me hanging, big time, but left an ounze of hope there will be a movie to complete the series.  6 Feet under was quite an amazing journey and actually did complete the series with the very last episode, which to me was a brilliant ending that brought all 5 seasons to a close.  Now, onto Carnivale...  The first season was a little slow, but I understood, character development and it was only 12 shows long.  The second season really picked up and I enjoyed them both immensley.  However, when you get near the end of season 2, you start thinking, ok a lot of stuff better start unfolding otherwise they are going to pull a Deadwood.  Well, you get to the last episode and blam, Deadwood!  Or if you watched Carnivale first, you probably said the same thing aboud Deadwood.  Eitherway, WTH HBO?  Jeeze...  if you are going to sell these freakin DVDs for 60+ dollars a pop/cable subscription for over $100 a year, at least give the people who pay for your cable subscription and DVDs some closure!
Anyway, I do highly recommend this show if you like suspense, mystery, and at times some serious creepiness to borderline horror.  It's a journey that is ended abruptly at Season 2 and I hope, like Deadwood, the more people that see how good this show is, the more will push to get them to finish it or reattack.

*As I read back through some of these posts, I came to a realization, that yes, in a sense, they did give you a small dose of closure, but it really feels forced, as in, there's no choice, we have to end this, but lets leave a something open in case we get to continue in the future*  Either way, I don't believe it was the best wrap up if they knew they were not going to make any further episodes.",1204243200,,1839,4.33625730994152

2576171,5,B000FL7C82,"Unlike most series, this one doesn't start out slow and boring, it catches your attention beginning with the very first episode. I had to do a project for a college class where we watched a show without the sound on, to try and figure out what was occurring via the nonverbal communication used. Then we were to view it again, but with the sound, to see how well we caught on to what was happening. I wanted to use something I had never seen before, and had been meaning to watch the series for over a year. I can't believe I put it off for as long as I did... Of course, I used episode one of season one for the project, and after watching it, I had to finish season one off within the week, then immediately moved on to season two. If I wasn't working full time, going to school, and watching my kids on my days off, I would have just plunked myself down in front of the tv right then and there, and watched them all straight through without budging for anything. Now that says a lot for me. I have a very large genre spread for what I like viewing, but the only other series I have ever liked enough to sit down and watch back to back are Firefly and Wonderfalls. Unfortunately, HBO cut Carnivale off before it was truly finished. They answered many questions with what they did in the two seasons that were produced, but there is still enough to go on that they could make an awesome movie to wrap up all the loose ends and not end up beating a dead horse like so many series go on to doing. I totally understand the fact that they wanted to end on a high note and not run the series into the ground by dragging it out when they have run out of new content ideas, so lets hope they decide to hit the big screen with the final moments of Clayton Jones, Sofie, Ben Hawkins, and all the other unique souls that make up the Carnivale.

It was like watching something vintage, dust puffs literally flying in the air, like the viewer is in the scene.  I, like most, can't believe HBO would cancel such a gem, but then again, they did it also with the wonderful series of ""Rome"". I will not be able to trust HBO to carry through with their commitments, and will never ever have HBO again.

CGI on an epic scale? HBO must have seen a steady flow of dollars blowing out of its accounts. And the viewership simply wasn't there during the course of the show's run.

It didn't make the non-renewal any less bittersweet for those of us who love this show. An extraordinary cast coupled to extraordinary scripts - it was as amazing as it was different. It wasn't television - it was HBO.

Ultimately, it wasn't even HBO - it was DOA

2576183,5,B000FL7C82,"As an ardent fan of this show, I am highly recommending the Second Season of Carnivale.  I so missed my favorite characters when I learned it had been cancelled.  The story line was meant to be over many years and it was left hanging by the PTB (powers that be) for reasons not totally understood.  I definitely agree with other posters as to character development, story, cinematography, music, sets, et al, so much so that I was literally hanging in for the long run.  My Sundays will never be the same!

It bears watching many times to catch all the nuances and meanings as there was so much written or said that one could miss the first time around.  The characters were not fully developed by the end of the second season and one was left wondering about so many aspects, that I find it hard to believe that PTB thought that it was nicely 'tied up' - they must have had rocks for brains.

You won't be disappointed with the second season - so much is happening that boredom is never an option.  Like Twin Peaks, The X Files and other shows that have been cancelled it was innovative, addicting, intelligent, different and ultimately, a milestone for television.  There is so much fluff on network television that I turn to cable for quality and shows that don't insult my ability to think and reason for myself.

Here's hoping that somewhere down the road we will find out what happens to Ben, Sofie, Libby, Samson, Justin, Stumpy, Jonesy and the rest!",1183939200,,1457,4.547892720306513
2576184,5,B000FL7C82,"I was very happy to get season two of Carnivale since I cancelled my HBO right after season one ended, turns out it was the only show I was watching at the time on there, so I just decided to save up some money to buy the DVD's every year, I was hoping to get one every year, but apparently the show has ended after sesaon two? I'm not a very big fan of the Sopranos, Deadwood doesn't look too bad, I've never seen it, but who knows perhaps I'll check it out on DVD eventually.

This is right up there as one of my all time favorite shows, my bag is the X-Files, Twin Peaks, Northern Exposure type stuff and I remember seeing the first ep on HBO many years ago, and I knew from the get-go that this was gonna be a classic series, too bad it appears to be ending after season two.

Nick Stahl and Clea Duvall are a great pair to watch, I forget some of the actors names but I love Stumpy, Jonesy, and of course Samson (who I just saw again in the last eps of Season Two of Twin Peaks last week).  The thing I like about these type of shows is how you can't wait to see what is around the corner, and it can be such a surprise, I think I watched two eps a day when I first got it, then it was 3 eps a day...doesn't take long to get through the entire season, but you can get lost in these characters and the times, as rough as it seemed back then, it sure looked like at times they were just throwing caution to the wind and just having a good time. It's a world where anything seems possible, it's a world where nothing is what it seems, always something to learn. Of course in the second season, it becomes a mission for Ben to follow his path, and at times can be a disturbing journey, it's a dangerous world now, and all the innocence seems to have been shed...but of course it is necessary in order for the show to grow and for the full story to be told, by the middle of season two you care so much about these characters, I felt so bad for Jonesy and Stumpy at times, and Ben just has so much stuff thrown at him all at once it seems.

The dialogue is superb I think, how accurate it is to the times might be fuzzy sometimes and the commentatary sometimes explains, they sometimes just winged it, but for Carny speak of the 30's, they probably were not far off. The dialogue along with great actors and actresses makes this show worth checking out. It's great to watch Ben finally give in to his gift and start to learn and go with it instead of pushing everyone away keeping it to himself, in the first season he was very distant and at times downright hostile towards any type of inquiry or even friendship, but in season two we finally see him start to grow up and face his destiny....and it's a heckuva ride.",1178668800,3,2717,4.0919324577861165
2576185,5,B000FL7C82,"It is a colossal disappointment that HBO decided not to renew ""Carnivale"" for another season.  This is one of the most sumptuous, vivid, intelligent and original series ever spun on TV.  That is surely what sounded its death knell - ""Carnivale"" must have been incredibly expensive to make, even though it cast very few recognizable actors.  Every artist must have its patron, and TV producers are no exception.

Season One ended with a brilliant cliff-hanger, and Season Two does not flag one iota.  Brother Justin (Clancy Brown, never better) continues to grow into his satanic persona . . . it is hard to remember what a sympathetic man he was at the outset of the first season.  Ben (Nick Stahl) continues to struggle with his identity, but he has more purpose in this season, and he becomes an active seeker for his own destiny.  The series builds to a climactic showdown between these two.

But as in Season One, the well-rounded cast of supporting characters continues to evolve in all their glorious, profane splendour.  Look for romance, heartbreak, major decisions, and, perhaps most importantly, for Sofie to learn the secret of her parentage.  To say that there are unexpected twists in the plot is an understatement, and I got dizzy trying to keep track of them all.

""Carnivale"" is not for the squeamish.  For all its intelligent writing, ""Carnivale"" offers plenty of guilty pleasures for the viewer.  Season Two delivers plenty of skin, plenty of sex, plenty of blood, and great heaping piles of dark religious imagery.  Shun all spoilers!  The climactic episode of Season Two ends with a surprising and enigmatic twist.  It's clear that there is still plenty of story to be told, and let's hope that somebody finds the financing to pick up this series for another installment . . . or, perhaps, a major cinematic effort like ""Serenity"" was for the ill-fated series, ""Firefly.""

Carnivale is definately worth getting even thought there's only two seasons.

Basically it's about a travelling carnival during the 30's depression.  But it is so much more!!  It is about love and hate, good and evil. The supernatural and the surreal are all here.  You have to like the unusual to like Carnival.  The second season answers alot more questions that the first season brought up.  My only disappointment is that it's over.  HBO was to continue it for 6 seasons.

This is one of the few chances in life to see true genius in writing, directing and acting.  If I ran HBO, or had the money to do it myself, I would bring all the cast & crew together to do several more seasons.  At the very least, I would create a feature film to try to finish the story.  Yes, the fight between light and dark can never be ""finished"", but it was a travesty that HBO ended this series when it did instead of allowing one more season to bring things to some sort of conclusion.  I would imagine that everyone connected to the creation of this show is richer for having been involved with it, as are the viewers who devoured every episode.

The theme was good vs evil.  This is nothing new, but the way it is presented here is what makes this such a special show.  Each episode was layed with scenery, characters and dialogue that do not grow stale with repeated viewings.  If you want to compare to a more conventional show think of LOST.

2576214,4,B000FL7C82,"Carnivale was a great show that I hope will live on in literature somehow. HBO is praised for creating these diamonds in the rough, but have no sense of closure. If you want a DVD Boxed set to really sell, here's an idea, FINISH THE SERIES.

Let's see, they cut off Carnivale after two seasons before it could be satisfactorily ended. Sure it had fans, just not enough. So to hell with those of us who loved Carnivale.

They cut off ""Deadwood"" after three seasons when David Milch was expecting to end it in four. Deadwood has fans too, but alas not enough, so they'll screw those of us who love ""Deadwood"" also.

""Rome"" may never get a second season, and will therefore also be cut short, and who cares what we think? Certianly not HBO.

Why make these series? Why put the money and time and publicity into something and not follow through with it? Why must HBO constantly leave their subscribers hanging? The bottom line is that most of these original series is the best reason to subscribe. Everything else HBO offers is movies we've already seen, or rented.

If they can't commit to a series and decide at one point or another where they will end it BEFORE committing to it, then they are all in the wrong business. FOX is starting to put out some risky stuff, so are other networks-- networks that don't cost anything to watch. Smarten up HBO.",1155859200,29,1348,4.485714285714286
2576215,4,B000FL7C82,"The second, and sadly final, season of Carnivale, is a prime example of a show that could have been something truly great, but thanks to poor ratings and soaring production costs, came to a sad end.  Both seasons of the show weren't anything incrdibly special, but the potential was there as it appeared to be one of those shows that has a grander scheme of things that take place over the course of several seasons (much like the X-Files).  As the second season begins, Ben (Nick Stahl) is accused of murder, and Justin (Clancy Brown) establishes his own town and temple in California.  As it happens, the carnival is coming his way, with an inevitable collision course between Ben and Justin on the horizon.  All this and more depends on a man named Harry Scudder (John Savage) who is linked to both Ben and Justin, and he will help decide the outcome in the final battle between good and evil.  Even though things never do completely get wrapped up, there is a bit of closure as the season, and series, comes to a close, but one can't help but wonder what might have been had HBO decided to at least re-new the series for at least one more season.  Maybe, hopefully, somehow things can get wrapped up completely in some other medium; I mean hey, it worked for Joss Whedon's Firefly with the Serenity movie, and Carnivale would be just as deserving as well.",1155427200,7,1359,4.549180327868853
2576216,5,B000FL7C82,"There has never been a show that has had such an impact on me like HBO's ""Carnivale.""  You can only imagine the heartbreak I went through when I found out that the show would not be renewed for another season.  In a world where there is so much pointless garbage on TV with no substance, no emotion and no thinking behind it (again, this is not always a bad thing), it was refreshing to see something that challenged us to the core like ""Carnivale"" did.  At long last, the second season has found its home on DVD.

It's hard to describe such a show without giving too much away, but I will do my best.  The first season left off with Ben Hawkins (an unlikely savior and healer) and Brother Justin (a man who once served religion has now found his place along darkness and an ultimate evil)finally realizing their path in life and knowing who they really are.  Ben is scared and instructed by the mysterious Management on what he has to do in order to prevent the end of the world as we know it, but Ben is not so sure who is using him and who he can trust.  Yet, he knows that the key to the final battle between good and evil is his father, Henry Scudder.  The problem is that Brother Justin is also looking for Scudder, as he has some terrible, awful plans of his own for the world.  These two are states away, but finally they will meet and the fate of the world ultimately depends on who ends up coming up on top.  And that's only a part of the overwhelming and forceful epic that is known as ""Carnivale.""

The second season is much more darker and unsettling than the first, and it never slows down.  As good as the first season was, the pace was very slow--but it had to be in order to set the pieces into place.  A lot of things that didn't make sense in the first season will come to light in this one.  The scenery, the look and feel of it all really cements this as a memorable and solid series that was quite possibly ahead of its time.  Not only does this show rely on great and hypnotic writing, but also the actors who give it their all and bring their characters to life.  With a show as complex as this, you have to have the writing and the characters, and this show has no problem delivering the goods on that front.  The DVD contains all 12 episodes and some very cool ""behind the scenes"" features that are worth seeing, along with commentaries on selected episodes.

""Carnivale"" is not a show for everybody.  It's extremely dark, brutal and the themes can get pretty disturbing and unsettling, especially since it deals with the religous and spiritual world.  If you are a fan of the first season, then this is a must-see, even if we may never get another season ever again.  Sure, not everything will be answered, the last episode does leave us hanging, but all in all this season is very satisfying and is even more exciting and thrilling than the first.  If you're looking for something you've never seen before, check it out.  I'm just happy the second season has finally found a home.  I just wished that such a great show had more of a chance.  I don't think I'll ever see anything that will ever surpass this, and I believe I will think that way until my last breath.  -Michael Crane",1154304000,86,3209,4.315525876460768
2576217,2,B000FL7C82,"""Carnivale"" was one of my favorite shows to watch.  It was well written and very well acted.  The art direction was genius -- every conceiveable detail of 1930's America seemed to breathe with life on the screen.

""Carnivale"" was also haunting.  There were elements of the story so freaky I had to watch it with the lights on.  And yet it was so captivating I kept coming back for more.

So, if it was so brilliant, why only two stars?

Because HBO cut this show so short of its potential it was shameful.  The show wasn't getting the ratings that the other HBO original shows were, so just when the story was really starting to get interesting, it was cut short.  I felt completely hoodwinked as a viewer and fan.  This DVD set just confirms it.  HBO, with their deep pockets, could have at least given it one more season, to tie up the story arcs more neatly, as a courtesy to the many hardcore fans of this show.  Instead they truncated it -- and yet they're still selling it!  What jerks.",1154131200,21,992,4.384615384615385
2576218,5,B000FL7C82,"I own both season Dvds of this show, so I may compare them a little. I personally like season 2 better, it may seem like it moves a little fast, but it could be that maybe the creators of the show knew it wasn't gonna be picked up for any future seasons.

The fast pace of the second season however, is something I particularly liked better than the first. The first season has more setup, especially with the characters, but the second season delivers. There's more action, more suspense, more everything.

I'm fighting an urge to spoil anything for those who haven't seen season 2 of Carnivale. For those who liked season 1, you're in for a real treat, since season 2 is better and really fills in some blanks left from the first season.

For those who have never seen an episode of Carnivale, I must recommend checking it out. Whether you rent it or buy it, it's a must view. For fans of mystery, suspense, horror, plus, in-depth characters, top-notch writing, and a story that leaves you wanting more, this show is for you.

I do watch most all Hbo's original programming, and between Oz, Carnivale, The Wire, it's a toss-up which of their original shows I think is best (though Dream On will always have a soft spot).

Without giving too much away, let's just say that the avatars of dark and light finally meet this season and everything leading up to this moment and the final showdown is breathtaking.  Shame on HBO for not renewing this brilliant series.  With Six Feet Under over, and Sopranos and Deadwood ending, it appears that the network has lost its way.  The cancellation of Carnivale is truly its most grave mistake because while those other series were/are able to come to a closure in some way, Carnivale was left haning.  Nevertheless, please give Carnivale a try.  You won't be disappointed.  It's truly stunning.  There are no words better to describe it other than: mesmerizing.",1153699200,7,905,4.947019867549669

I never subscribed to HBO for their movies that have already been shown in theaters and are available on DVD. Rather, I subscribed for their original programming.

Now that Six Feet Under and Carnavale are gone, and Deadwood and Sopranos are coming to an end, so is my subscription to HBO. Once the remaining shows I enjoy are no longer in new production, I really have no reason to continue subscribing.

After watching HBO shows that end abruptly without closure, I simply refuse to invest my time in any of their new programming. The fact that they are more than willing to cancel a show midstream makes it not worth trying any of their new programs.

It is unfortunate HBO has gone down this path. They were once known for their willingness to produce groundbreaking programming.

The second season was a much different and disappointing viewing experience.

The story was dumbed down and the pace was sped up.  Locating Scudder was completely anti-cilmactic as he too-willingly returned to the carnival to confront Management.  Elements of the story were cringe-inducingly embarassing (""The Shroud of Management""). Plotlines (such as the building of Justin's temple) were inexplicably abandoned.  Logic was likewise abandoned: Justin's enforcer, a prison escapee who killed a guard and moved about the country wreaking death and destruction was never pursued by law enforcement; Sophie got to California in an incredibly short period of time and coincidentally got a job working for Brother Justin; in the finale (where a cornfield sprung up out of nowhere) many people were killed and again the police apparently took no interest as they never showed up to investigate.

This is the one product on Amazon.com that i'd bet my house on; I challenge those reading this message to watch both seasons of Carnivale and then deem HBO's ultimate cancellation as warranted.

There is no guarentee that they will ever run an HBO origional series through to a definate and proper ending. Why bother getting into any more of their stories if they aren't going to finish them?

  If you have seen the series, this is worth the buy. It has total re-watchability. (sorry if that isn't a word) If you are new to Carnivale, watch it anyway. Everything about it was wonderfull.

2576226,5,B000FL7C82,"This is by far what I consider to be the BEST series HBO has ever produced. While some say the first season moved too slow, the second season took off and your feet would never touch the ground again. By now everyone knows the plot. The great depression, battle of good versus evil in a supernatural battle for world domination, all set around a traveling group of rag-tag carnies going from city to city just to exist. Each member with a secret and each fitting into a perfect 3D puzzle. Thrust into this, the great satan of Brother Justin and the reluctant Ben Hawkins who does not want to face up to his destiny. Even the final battle was not the end. Season three would have been just as mind blowing if not for the rocket scientists who run HBO.

Despite the huge campaign, those same people have ignored the great hue and cry to resurrect the series. Much in the same mind frame as NBC executives in 1968 when Star Trek was cancelled. Personally, I cancelled my subscription to HBO and have never looked back. For anyone into Stephen King, see this and realize just how inadequate the ""master"" is when compared to a really great gothic horror series.

2576229,5,B000FL7C82,"Carnivale is such an amazing show.  I ran out immediately and bought the $100 season one as soon as it became available and watched the entire season in one sitting on a Sunday morning prior to the premier of season two.  Delving into the first season like this opened up some mysteries to me, and unlocked some clues that I had the luxury of being validated in the first episode of season two.

Season Two answered a lot of these burning questions, it raised the stakes of the looming confrontation, it threw in some intriguing twists, and finally gave us an amazing pay-off at the end.  The problem is, is that there is still so much more of the story that needs to be told and this fascinating saga is no where near completed.

One of the biggest mistakes HBO has ever made was to cancel this series in the heart of its story-telling.  Since they've done that, I have done everything in my power to distance myself from their programming.  How can the company expect a decent amount in DVD sales when the price they decide to charge is obscene?  Most consumers immediately realize that they can take their $100 and turn around and buy a 24 episode season of some hit show, and at LEAST three full length feature movies for the same price.  Especially in this world of pirated and downloadable media; it appears that HBO is rather naive and making some bad business decisions on bogus data.

Regardless of HBO, I will definitely be purchasing this long awaited Season Two of Carnivale on 7/18/2006 and preparing myself for another marathon of watching the enthralling saga play out one final time.",1149811200,52,1599,4.598591549295775
2576230,5,B000FL7C82,"Aaahh, finally the second season is here. Carnivale is one of those shows that grabs you right from the start. Season 2 is a continuation of where Season 1 left off. So, if you've missed the first season, you'll be pretty much lost here.

As the story unfolds, you get more and more excited. This is how I felt watching each show. Ben Hawkins is coming to grips with his power, at the same time the priest is rising to power. The clash between good and evil is about to come, and we're left guessing what's going to happen throughout the way. The story takes a turn towards the dark side. Hope seems to be a luxury few can afford, the Carnival itself is not doing well. What will happen in the end? Who is Management? Is it all forseen or can Ben pave the steps to his own future? These are some of the questions going through my mind as I watched the episodes and I am sure looking forward to watching this show again because I am sure there were things I missed the first time round.

Enough can't be said about the story. Bold, intelligent and creative would be some of the words I would use to describe it. The story never ceases to amaze me. It is so well crafted, episode after episode. Where Season 1 to me, was pretty slow to take off the ground...here it's full steam ahead. I was completely glued to the screen at all times. So cautious was I to NOT miss anything. I was really disappointed with the finale only because I heard this was the last season but it didn't have closure. I then found out that it was written for something like 4 seasons and HBO ended it for budget reasons. This was such a shame as I think the story would've developed to something really great, which is pretty rare in TV nowadays. The acting was superb across the board, no surprise there. And the music from Jeff Beal continues to dazzle me. I can safely say, quarter of this show's success can be attributed to the music. Ominous, calm, eerie...the music contributes real emotion to Carnivale.

In short, if you've watched the 1st season and loved it, I don't know why you're even reading this review. Buy it already! If you have not, buy Season 1 and 2. If you're looking for an unconventional, original story that unravels slowly and surely to become a masterpiece...look no further, you've found it.",1149379200,23,2293,4.403301886792453

I admire artists that bring us as an audience a step further,but as we all know art was never a popular thing. Hopefully ,they (the producers and HBO),will come around on their decision and have the courage ,to not only be commercial and in the not so distant future bring more of that wonderful surreal world that CARNIVALE was all about. Buy it and ENJOY IT!!!",1149379200,16,662,4.765217391304348
2576232,5,B000FL7C82,"I've been waiting for this show to be released, I've even called the HBO store several times to try to get a relase date.  I love this show, the first season is a masterpiece now because of the second season.  You can see how everything is set up so well, all the story lines become fulfilled in the second season.  I was constantly waiting for each show to be released, waiting for the next week to come around just so I could see what happens.  It sucks that they cancelled it in the middle of the story, but oh well, at least I'll soon have both seasons one and two on DVD.  A curse on any executive that had a part in its demise.",1149292800,17,633,4.07258064516129
8124552,5,B000FL7C82,Carnivale is one of my favorite TV series. It feeds my odd personality I guess. I wish they would have kept going with it. I have watched it at least twice since getting it.  It was shipped to me really fast and was packaged very well.,1526774400,,235,4.108695652173913

8124557,5,B000FL7C82,"I really liked the series, spent a few days watching all two seasons. Not happy with the ending but understandable since it was supposed to last more seasons. So why did HBO end it? I'm sure they had many explanations. BUT seeing how close to our own era this was, I have my own ideas. That was set in the Great Depression but with some changes it could be during this New Great Depression. Many humans are as deprived, as some of these character; many people living in terrible poverty (which the power that be try to hide, not very successfully); people having to go to extremes just to survive and on and on. We don't have the travelling carnivals anymore, and you don't see people as filthy (asides from some of the homeless living in the streets) or the land so dead (asides from some areas of the nation) but all in all, as the expression goes, ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"". The end leaves me with little hope, but not all is lost. (Same as in our current real life.) We can pretend things are much better, but it doesn't make it true. I found a book a few years ago called ""The Depression Years: As photographed by Arthur Rothstein"" were you can see just how well made was this series, when it comes to presenting how it was for some people. (It has a photo of a dancing woman, in a carnival, although she is more covered than the ones here.)",1520553600,,1374,4.308880308880309
8124558,2,B000FL7C82,"Awkward, magic driven plot and characters that are just not much likable or attractive. Clea Duvall cannot act and should avoid hetero female lead roles. Photography and art is excellent, and the dialog is snappy. The writer admitted he was going for gritty realistic unattractive actors -- and surprise, cancelled after two of six seasons. People don't go to movies to see plain and ordinary.",1520121600,,393,5.061538461538461
8124559,5,B000FL7C82,"Wow just spent 3 days binge watching this show. I could not wait until my day was over working, so I could watch more episodes. I then google to see how many seasons it ran and found out the horrible news! Only 2- what are you crazy? it was/is a great show! Well I just finished the final episode of the 2nd and last season and I must say -I will miss the characters and the Carnivale! Bring it back darn it! :-)",1519344000,,412,3.9759036144578315
