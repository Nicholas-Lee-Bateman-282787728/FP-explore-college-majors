8756562,5,B01DOQ1AN2,"From 1965 to 1981 Frank Sinatra recorded seven hour long TV specials (covering all three major networks). The original tapes are owned by the Sinatra Family and Estate and  over the years  have been released on home video  the most recent (until now)  was a collection by Shout Family in 2012. Now, as the Sinatra 100 celebration is winding down, Eagle Rock has repackaged them with 2-3 shows per DVD in three separate volumes and priced them at the amazingly low SRP of $9.98 per volume. They have also released  for the first time in the US  the 90 minute Concert for the Americas on a fourth volume. If you own all the others, you probably don't need the first three (but may want the CFTA one. If you don't own these, and are a Sinatra fan, the purchase is a no-brainer, in my opinion. Not at under $3.00 per show to own and reply.

Be aware that Sinatra had guests on many of these shows. Some  like the one with Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie are classic performances. But the Francis Albert Sinatra Does His Own Thing will have you skipping thru (or cringing) as Frank (in full 1968 hippie attire) tries to sing with the 5th Dimension on Laura Nyros Sweet Blindness! (Yes, its truly cringe-worthy.). (Thanks for DVD track indexing.
The quality is high and the sound too, (or at least the best you can hope for) since these are the originals that Sinatra and his family preserved.

Also note that the shows were recorded in 4:3 aspect ratio and so you will see black bars on both sides on your flat screen TV
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
