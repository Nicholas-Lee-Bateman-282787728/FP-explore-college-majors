8265644,5,B0017CW5Q2,"It was very true to life of an Italian woman of the era and Sofia Loren is the most beautiful and talented actress of her time.  She is timeless and a true beauty.  Anthony Quinn's performance also was great, however she took over the story.",1382832000,,241,4.333333333333333
8265645,5,B0017CW5Q2,"I bought this twofer to get Breath of a Scandal, because I'm on a Ferenc Moln&aacute;r kick, and have enjoyed the films I've seen of his plays so far. This might have been the best. It's funny and _clever_. No banana peels, no car chases, just clever dialog by intelligent (and beautiful) people. The very epitome of entertainment.

Black Orchid is a serious film, done--I think--not long after Sophia got into US films. She was a fine, fine actress right from the beginning, and this film shows us that in spades.",1375228800,,514,4.648351648351649
