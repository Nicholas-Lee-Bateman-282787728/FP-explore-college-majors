8382285,1,B002VLBG04,"The DVD does not work. DaaVeeDee said that if I had read the fine print, I would have seen that the DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada.  DaaVeeDee offers an 80% refund; if I return the DVD (at my expense) and pay a 20% restocking fee, they will refund the balance. That means that I would be penalized $$ for not scouring the fine print. I should not have to read the fine print to ensure that a DVD purchased in the USA will play on standard American machines. In future, should I read the fine print to ensure that a CD will play on standard devices sold in the USA? I have ordered, through Amazon, CD's made in Britain that work on my devices. I will not do business with this company again.",1380240000,,722,4.084507042253521
8382286,1,B002VLBG04,"I ordered this DVD, believing that non-USA format meant, perhaps, different credits, interviews, etc. I did not know that US customers would not be permitted to watch it at all. I was chagrined, as I paid shipping and the cost for a DVD that was, essentially, worthless for us. The seller did give me a full credit, which I appreciate, but what I would appreciate even more is the opportunity to buy this hilarious movie in a DVD format that all us Americans can enjoy.",1328659200,3,469,4.529411764705882
