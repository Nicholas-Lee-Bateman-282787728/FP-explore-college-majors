4464454,2,B004STBFL2,"Blue gender doesn't have any real energy that the other Anime series give you. To much attempt at Drama with no comedy for the entire series. Plot isn't explained thoroughly. And the action scenes, when they happen are recut, rerun snippets over & over again. Snore Fest.",1320019200,,271,4.787234042553192
4464455,5,B004STBFL2,"Let me begin by saying that Blue Gender is a creative, well-done, edge-of-your-seat anime series geared towards a mature audience; Blue Gender is certainly one of the more unique apocalyptic, military sci-fi animes in my opinion. That said, if you want a synopsis of the show, you can easily find those elsewhere. Here is the breakdown of the actual DVD set:

Overall Breakdown:
-Total Running Time:  750 minutes
-Languages:  English & Japanese
-Subtitles:  English
-Region:  1, 2, & 4 NTSC
-Format Ratio:  4:3
-Sound:  English 5.1 Surround, Japanese 5.1 Surround, Dolby Digital

Disc 1:
-Episodes 1 through 7
-Episode 1 Commentary with commentary from Laura Bailey, Eric Vale (Eric Johnson), and Christopher Sabat (voice director and voice of Keith)

Disc 2:
-Episodes 8 through 14

Disc 3:
-Episodes 15 through 20

Disc 4:
-Episodes 21 through 26

Disc 5:
-""Blue Gender: The Warrior"" movie
-Original Trailer (US trailer)
-Rough Sketch Collection: collection of pre-production sketches
-Blue File 1: profiles of the various types of blue
-Blue File 2: more profiles of the various types of blue
-""Break Free"" Extended Version music video (the English opening theme song)
-""Love Taught Me"" Extended Version music video (the English closing theme song)
-""Tokihanate"" Remix music video (the Japanese opening theme song)
-Armor Shrike File: profile of the various types of armored shrikes
-Original Japanese Media Commercials
-Textless Songs
-Trailers (basically just previews for other Funimation shows).

Note that almost all of the special features with the exception of the commentary are on Disc 5.

One of the nice things about this set is that not only has Funimation condensed the entire series into a sleek, 5-disc set, but Funimation has avoided using the much dreaded double sided DVD's (thankfully all of the DVD's are single-sided, in case you were wondering). The special features are an added bonus for any true fan of Blue Gender. Another positive for this boxed set is the big improvement over both the Complete Collection and the Viridian versions. The sound is smooth, and in 5.1 the sound comes across clear, loud, and concise. The original Japanese dialogue is maintained, but it should be noted that the subtitles are off from the English dialogue, meaning that the English subtitles are direct translations from the Japanese. Perhaps the only thing I dislike is the fact that discs 2 through 4 automatically begin playing previews when loading the discs. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this box set for any true fans looking to own the complete Blue Gender series. Lastly, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to post them and I will try my best to address them.",1318291200,33,2714,5.110859728506787

4464457,5,B004STBFL2,"This is my favorite anime series. It's hard to explain why, but I'll try.

The series itself is nothing special, Giant robots ( 1-2 stories tall ), giant bugs ( height varies, lol ), giant battles, and a giant and involved plot with amazing characters.
The show itself is a strong 3-4 but the characters in this show feel very real, and are well developed within the story. By the end you really feel for the characters and you really remember them. When I first saw this show I was 13-14, and I still recalled nearly all of what the characters were like when I bought this only a few weeks ago, if I can still recall a character and his emotions after 5+ years I think that's saying something for the shows character development.
The plot itself is a new flavor of a post-apocolyptic world, The blue ( giant insects ) have taken over the earth and humanity fights to reclaim their world, and that's about it. The show revolves around this plot, which alone would be entertaining, but with the strong and interesting characters it's amazing.
The main character, Yuji, wakes up from a stasis ( long sleep ) and is thrust into this decayed world, it is through his eyes most of the story is told, and it is through him that the show hits its stride. Yuji, is an incredibly complex and interesting character.
I will not explain anymore, because I don't wish to spoil anything, but I will say this, I am not an anime fan but this was amazing on many levels and I would suggest it to anyone that likes science fiction or action.

It is truly a 5 star series, buy it and you won't regret it! :]",1310688000,9,1588,4.361486486486487
4464458,3,B004STBFL2,"In the future, civilization has collapsed, because the earth is infested by big, big bugs.

It sounds like the stuff of utter mind blowing disaster, but thankfully ""Blue Gender"" succeeds in being a fairly intelligent, intricate sci-fi anime. Lots of horror, giant bugs and a fish-out-of-water hero who manages to be fairly interesting as he becomes a seasoned warrior, but the characters develop by leaps and bounds -- and the ending is completely out of left field, apparently in an attempt to be bleak and ""deep.""

Yuji Kaido was an ordinary teenager in the not-too-distant future, until he came down with a strange disease. The only hope for a cure is to be put into cryogenic sleep.

A few decades later, he awakes to a whole new Earth -- sparsely populated, civilization overturned, and with every continent overrun by hideous enormous insects called the Blue. Then two enormous mecha piloted by humans appear, and after many dangers Yuji is taken by a chilly soldier named Marlene to Second Earth, a space station where humanity is organizing a fight against the Blue.

But Yuji soon learns that life is dangerous -- not just because of the Blue, but because of the militarized humans on Second Earth, who see him just as a sample to be used. After Yuji vanishes, Marlene begins a desperate quest to find him, even if it gets her in hot water. And when she does find him, they both discover the secret of Yuji and the Sleepers, and why they may be the key to destroying the Blue once and for all. Except of course things aren't that simple.

""Blue Gender"" has a pretty generic sci-fi concept behind it, the sort of thing you'd probably see on a Sci Fi original movie. Fortunately the actual series is much better than you'd think -- a vivid cocktail of action, conspiracy-laden suspense and science fiction in equal measure, but with the occasional pauses injected between the action and suspense sequences, where the writers can focus on the characters and what they feel.

Along the way, there's lots of grotesque, vaguely Freudian megabugs that have swarmed all over the globe, and whose origins are explored even as they eat people and overturn large machines. Lots of splattered gore, enormous insects that almost look real, and big industrial-looking mecha. But as the series winds on, there's an increasing emphasis on what the humans are doing as well, and their desperation to defeat the Blue -- and there are some surprising plot twists thrown into the mix.

The biggest weak point? The ending is a disaster that throws out most of what comes before it, in the name of a bizarre pseudo-environmental message that just explodes out of the, ahem, Blue. It feels like the writers couldn't come up with a suitably epic ending, so they went for the most bleak and ""deep"" finale they could.

Yuji is a bit of a pain at first, since he does nothing but scream and panic over the first few episodes. But after a little while, he decides to become master of his own fate, and his story arc shows him turn from a nice ordinary guy to a hardened soldier. On the flipside, Marlene starts as an ice princess, but we see her gradually
thawing under Yuji's influence until she has become more like he once was, and vice versa. Most of the secondary characters die off or vanish pretty quickly, but they're well-drawn as well.

This box set also contains ""The Warrior,"" which basically takes the whole movie and whittles it down to movie length. It's sort of ""Blue Gender: The Cliff's Notes,"" and it's a severely mixed bag.

""Blue Gender Box Set"" is a solid sci-fi/action anime with plenty of giant bugs and military attacks, but the ending entirely spins out of control.",1304294400,13,3671,4.712948517940718

The movie is a condensed version of the TV show and if you don't have time to watch the whole thing, the movie will basically tell you what happens from the beginning to the end. I prefer the episode that I can watch on a daily basis. I have always wanted a copy of this on DVD, and I was glad that I was able to buy it inexpensively here.

A young man who had an incurable disease was put to sleep in the hope that a cure may be found in the future. When he woke up by accident, the entire planet was already well invaded by aliens. Having to quickly adjust to what was happening around him, he was saved by a few fighters who were stationed on a satellite above the earth.

4464472,5,B004STBFL2,"The Blue Gender series is an anomaly. I love anime art and style, and I love many of the cyberpunk animes of the eighties, but almost all modern anime is so inane and derivative as to render it unwatchable. In most anime stories, the main characters are one dimensional and do not evolve, the plots are outrageous, the philosophical and moral themes are superficial and trite if present, and the story arcs fall apart well before the conclusionif there is one. Blue Gender is an anomaly because it is the opposite of all of that. It is a poignant story about humanity finding a reason to (and perhaps proving its right to) survive in a terrifying post-apocalyptic world of a kind I have never seen before or since. The themes are hope, courage, friendship, comradery, right and wrong, man versus nature, and love. You see the journey of a character that has a logical beginning, middle, and end that amounts to a beautiful story of self-discovery. I call it the Battlestar Galactica (re-imagined) of anime. This series fills me with joy and sorrow, not only because of its poignant story, but because its what anime could be. This is no typical anime. This is one of the best, most chilling end-of-days yarns you will ever be on the edge of your seat for. This is a sci-fi, cyberpunk war epic worthy of the bygone era of animation. This is the finest anime Ive ever seen. This is Blue Gender.",1396224000,4,1392,4.594377510040161

The action is so realistic.  They are very human characters with human deficiencies and nuances. . .No character is gifted with charisma or charm, but slowly you see the role reversals of the main characters.  The struggles, the ideals and morals, each has to swallow like a bad medicine, becomes a struggle.  For life and death and love. . .

4464483,4,B004STBFL2,"'Blue Gender' is a nice little series I first discovered some years ago on Toonami late one night.  The story is pretty simple, mankind fighting giant bug-like creatures.  Think 'Starship Troopers' and you are on the right track.  The animation quality varies from decent to great.  The episode length is apx 20 minutes per episode.

***Pros***

Entire series and movie come in a space saving release hardly bigger than a standard DVD case.  Great for those of us running low on real estate for movies.

Good transfer of media to DVD.

No dreaded double-sided DVD's.  All disc's are singled side media with silk screened tops.

Episode/Disc guide printed right inside the case for easy reference.

Great selling price
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Cons***

Movie the ""Warrior"" is nothing more than the series re-cut into a film with a different ending.

Case is cheap.  The O-Sleeve rips easily and is nothing special.  You like me will probably discard it.  Be careful with the spindles the discs sit in, they can snap if too much pressure is applied to them.  The ""pages"" the inner discs sit in can come loose if your not careful.  Mine is in tack, but this design can break easily.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Final Thoughts***

Overall a great release of this series.  The case may be cheap, but don't let this deter you from buying.  Handle it with care and you should be okay.  Series is quite enjoyable to watch and you can knock it out pretty quickly.  I have just about finished it myself and definitely will be done before I go back to work.

Well that's my thoughts on this product.  It's great to see good Anime series getting affordable releases.  Here's hoping the 'Bleach: Hell...' movie is good.  I am looking forward to that one.",1350950400,,2485,5.686813186813187
4464484,4,B004STBFL2,"This anime has a very played out story line. It reminded me of the Robotech New Generation saga. The plot centers around Yuji. Yuji is awakened into a world devastated by giant bugs called the Blue. Yuji supposedly has Blue cells inside of him that make him a perfect candidate to fight against them. The elite members of humanity live in a space station called 2nd Earth. Yuji meets Marlene. She's a soldier with a crappy personality and mad skills. She eventually opens up to Yuji and makes a major turn around. They fight to protect each other and their friends from the Blue.

This anime has a very average story line, but the character development is what saves it. There are some pretty cool characters in this anime. The action and drama gets pretty intense especially toward the end. I don't really dig on the animation either. I remember when this anime came out. Even then it seemed like the animation was a little less than the standard. Overall This series gets a 4. Even though there are some very low budget things about it, the characters save it from being a drag. It's worth a look see.
