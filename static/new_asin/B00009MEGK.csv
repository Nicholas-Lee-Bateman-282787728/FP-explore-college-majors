I was so excited when I found this for my daughter. She loves it too! She is only 14 months old right now and unable to sing along yet, but she dances to the music and LOVES the monkeys and birds! This is great family fun. I highly recommend it.",1356566400,,377,3.725

1885267,5,B00009MEGK,"Joe Scruggs has my eternal admiration.  His music is never condescending or childish, but rather appeals to the child in all of us.  I appreciate his calm, tender voice that is never forced or falsely excited.  The songs, puppets, animation, photography, and pace of the DVD kept our toddler twins and 2 year old grandson either giggling or at rapt attention for forty five minutes.  Well done, Joe!",1207353600,,399,4.823529411764706

1885269,4,B00009MEGK,"A remarkable adventure for old and young. Joe has a way of taking the least likely phrase or event and turning it into laughter and excitement. We still chuckle over the ""In the Bahamas"" song. My wife gave this to me as a present and I still thank her for it. Take an hour and be a kid again. This DVD will take you there.",1107475200,6,322,3.9692307692307693
