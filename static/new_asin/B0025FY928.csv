3848124,5,B0025FY928,"[KURONEKO aka BLACK CAT - (1968) - Directed by Kaneto Shindo - Widescreen Presentation]  From the director of 'Onibaba' and 'The Island', this genuinely creepy, atmospheric (and somewhat obscure) classic finally gets a stateside release; even more blessed are we that it's getting the Criterion treatment. Riding the critical wave after 'Onibaba' was released, Kaneto Shindo, along with Kiyomi Kuroda, whose award-winning cinematography sets the tone for this film, brilliantly delivers the chills with an underlying tragic story of lost love and revenge, and its Chiaroscuro/Noir visuals are nothing short of breathtaking.

In feudal Japan, a warring group of marauding Samurai seeking food emerge from the dense forest when they come across a house that should have what they require. Upon entering the house, they find it indeed has what they want and a whole lot more...it has women as well. The inhabitants, an elderly woman and her young daughter-in-law are both subjected to continuous sexual assault as each Samurai takes his turn while others plunder the women's food stocks. After the Samurai have satiated their appetites, they leave the women, now unconscious, for dead and set fire to their home as they flee. When the fire eventually burns out, all we see are the burned and battered bodies of the women amid the ruins and their vulnerable black kitten as it licks their charred bodies, a dark and grisly moment captured purrrfectly.

Later on, one night a Samurai approaches on horseback and is met by the spectral vision of a woman, who tells him she is too frightened to make her journey home because she has to pass the Bamboo Grove, which is a known haven for bandits and highwaymen. The Samurai agrees to accompany her to her home, where he is plied with sake. The woman then proceeds to seduce the Samurai before brutally attacking him, devouring his throat and sucking his blood...for we then learn that the two women are in fact Bakeneko, newly embodied catlike vampire spirits of the dead women murdered by the Samurai, who have made a pact with the evil spirits, granting them restored life on the condition that they murder all Samurai who pass their way. These nightmarish acts continue until a young man victorious in war is hired to hunt down the vampires, but he soon realizes to his horror that these creatures are the vengeful souls of his mother and wife who died while he was off at war. He is now torn between his lord, who orders him to rid the forest of ghosts or else he will be killed, and his mother and wife's ethereal forms whom he loves and couldn't possibly fathom killing.

Though it may not sound like it, this film is rife with indelible, grotesque imagery that will stay with you forever, yet maintains a Kabuki play arthouse quality right through to the tense final moments. The swamp location is a perfect setting for the film to take place and director Shindo takes full advantage of it, especially during the scenes where the younger of the two women is leading the stray, egotistical  Samurai to their inevitable deaths. If you enjoyed 'Onibaba', 'Kwaidan', or even the more recent 'Kaidan' (a modern retelling of this type of flick), you're certain to appreciate this one. Let this 'Black Cat' cross your path and your luck's bound to be good...",1313625600,153,3299,4.862989323843417
3848125,5,B0025FY928,"This is a film I have only seen on a crappy foreign bootleg copy --the picture was washed out and even muddy in patches and the sound was boxy, but the shortcomings of the poor transfer (from who knows what sources) were soon forgotten as I was immersed in the masterful storytelling and lovely atmospheric world of the filmmakers.  This is a classic, old-school, Japanese ghost story, told at a measured pace and more creepy than shocking (which means it may not hold the attention of restless viewers who demand a rock'em-sock'em, CGI rollercoaster ride, and OMG --it's in black & white!), but it's just my cup of tea.  I look forward to seeing this film decently presented, and you can always count on Criterion to get the job done.",1313452800,69,735,4.6461538461538465
3848126,4,B0025FY928,"Japanese cinema in the 1960's was marked by a wave of ghost stories.""Onibaba"" by the director Kaneto Shinda was a big hit in 1964 ,not just in Japan but in overseas markets. Perhaps suprisingly in light of this success it took the director  some time to return to the genre and it was not until 1968 that he came out with ""Kuroneko"",another slab of moody monochrome ghostliness.

The movie begins with a shot of a hut near a bamboo forest; several samurai emerge and enter the hut where they rape and  murder the two female residents, the mother (Nobuko Otowa) and her daughter (Kiwako Taichi),before burning the place down and leaving. A black cat emerges and licks the b;ood from their faces ,this serving to restore the dead to life as vampiric ghosts. They vow to exact revenge for their deaths by killing any samurai coming within their path.

Ginotki (Kichremon Nakamura) is a peasant boy ,elevated to the ranks of the samurai by virtue of his wartime heroics and he is despatched by his arrogant master to destroy the ghosts ,only to discover they are his own wife and mother. The theme of love in conflict with duty then takes over as the ""motif""of the second part of the picture  as Ginotki must confront his loved ones demonic apparitions .
Ginotki is introduced in a conventionally heroic way ,riding on horseback across dangerous terrain to the sound of stirring martial music ,but it is clear he is not wholly comfortable in his new ,elevated social position. He is of peasant stock and is patronised by his preening elitist master Raiko (Kei Sato) .Thus ,social class forms an important subtect to the ghostly goings on.

The love scenes between Ginotki and his wife are erotic without being explicit and indeed convey a tinge of melancholy as love becomes a source of conflict rather than a resolution of it

This is a meditative and elegaic movie that will reward those whose taste is for the subtler forms of screen horror but is perhaps best avoided by devotees of slasher movies and torture porn like ""Saw""",1285200000,2,2025,4.703389830508475
3848127,5,B0025FY928,"This is a wonderful Japanese film classic, by the same director of ONIBABA & in my opinion is better than that more famous film. This is wonderfully eerie, atmospheric & magicly surreal with stunning cinematography & editing. It's spooky, erotic & tragic at the same time. I agree with Frank Gorshin's comments but would like to know: HOW do you hack a DVD player for PAL, non-USA format? This film is an overlooked classic (like Saragossa Manuscript) & SHOULD be available in the US for screening & video viewing.

Soldiers rape and murder a mother and daughter who come back as bloodsucking cat ghosts.  But it's also a love story, because the daughter's husband was forced to fight, and he returns after years of absence....  No cheesy effects: it's all in the artful use of shadow and light.  Plus, the use of sound (pulsing drums, sparse screeching noises) is just amazing.  Kubrick definitely studied this film.",1275523200,,523,4.831460674157303
3848129,4,B0025FY928,"Kuroneko aka Black Cat (1968) is a spiritual successor to 1964's Onibaba. Both of them deal with peasant women characters (woman and daughter-in-law) and their murderous interactions with Samurai. Unlike in the films of Kurosawa or Kobayashi, the Samurai of Shindo's film have no glow of honor or nobility. They are rapacious bastards who exploit the peasantry and are in turn murdered by them. While the motive for murder in Onibaba was survival (the women trade the armor and weapons they get from murdering wounded samurai), here it is revenge (they are the vengeful spirits of peasants raped and killed by soldiers, now sworn to kill and drink the blood of passing samurai). The twist comes when a Samurai sent to tackle the murders of his comrades turns out to be the son/husband of the pair that had been forcibly conscripted and then made his name as a warrior. Whether the spirits of the women will still carry out their vow of vengeance against Samurai, or whether the warrior is able to overcome them forms the rest of the film's narrative.
Kuroneko is brilliantly framed. The scenes set in the house of the spirit women have a deliberate theatricality in terms of the set design, use of props and effects, the erotic ballet like movements of the characters - it is a reflection of the illusion created by the spirits to trap their Samurai victims. The lighting and camera movements are top-notch generating a solid atmosphere. But compared to Onibaba, the narrative feels less visceral and affecting, the repetitive depiction of the seduction and/or killing of Samurai although it helps to establish a pattern, begins to get tiresome after a while. Really this feels like a short movie stretched out in its running time. It is most badly affected in the last act which falls into the ""Character in horror film does incredibly stupid things"" trap. It's definitely worth watching once, but not more than that for me.
In presentation, Criterion's blu-ray is superb, with HD visuals that nicely complement Eureka/MoC's fabulous blu-ray of Onibaba. The image has terrific contrast and lovely texture. The mono sound effective conveys dialog and the moody score. Extras are few but significant - there's a 30-min video essay on Kuroneko by critic Tadao Sato and there's a really nice hour-long interview with Kaneto Shindo (shot in 1998) in which he goes over his entire film-making career till that point.",1446163200,,2411,4.955555555555556

Filmed in black and white, it has an atmospheric quality  of mist and darkness, that combines with ghostly Japan and elements of Noh drama that make this a visual feast of the macabre.
  The plot is of two peasant women who are robbed, raped, and murdered by a band of rogue samurai.  Shortly thereafter dead samurai with their throats ripped out  are being found by the rajomon gate in kyoto.  The samurai lord is ordered by the emperor to stop the killings (kill the demon).  He has a new vassal who is distinguished in war, and gives him the task.  The vassal samurai finds to his horror that the demon(s) are his dead wife and mother (murdered by the rogue samurai) taking vengeance by drinking the blood of samurai.  The ensuing conflicts of love, oaths, and duty, make this a great story, which packs some palpable chills.

3848147,5,B0025FY928,"Yabu No Naka No Kuroneko (The Black Cat from the Grove, shortened to just Kuroneko) is a masterpiece of Gothic horror directed by Kaneto Shindo and released in 1968.  As with many Japanese ghost stories, Kuroneko is brooding and atmospheric.  The cinematography skillfully blends and light and darkness to give the story an eerie feel.

*spoilers* The film tells the story of a mother and daughter-in-law who are savagely raped and murdered by a band of marauding samurai.  They made a bargain with the god of evil, represented by a black cat, to avenge themselves on the samurai by exterminating them one by one.  The local warlord wants the ""monster"" to be exterminated and calls upon one of the heroes of the war to do kill the beast.  However, the chosen samurai finds it impossible to fulfill the warlords demand because he knows the ghosts. *end spoilers*

I agree with Carlos Romero that the story has a strong anti-war message as the cruel effects of a long war (famine, pestilence and cruelty) are at the heart of this story of revenge. One has sympathy for the ghosts and little for their victims.  I was not bothered by the length of the film and found myself paying close attention, wondering how the story would conclude. I would watch this film again for the sheer beauty of the images and the superb performances this film.

these films are obviously made with loving care - with striking photography - either in B&W - as is this film - or in color

the stories often flow in slow ritualized kabuki style - with very stylized acting by most

like the horror - the sexual situations are very tame by today's standards

the transfer to Criterion DVD looks terrific - if the original film is better - it must be absolutely stunning

there is no film commentary on the Criterion DVD - but there are a couple interviews - one with the writer/director Shindo Kaneto himself - and a highly informative one with film critic Sato Tadao

3848152,4,B0025FY928,"Japanese film director Kaneto Shindo's 1968 black and white horror film, Kuroneko (Yabu No Naka No Kuroneko or The Black Cat From The Groves), is a film both in step with its era- especially with the horror films coming out of Italy, and those from England's Hammer studios, yet it is also a much deeper and cinematic film. It got worldwide acclaim, upon its release, but didn't get good stateside distribution due to the cancellation of the 1968 Cannes Film Festival where it was considered one of the strongest entries. In a sense, it shares much with another horror film released the same year, from Sweden's Ingmar Bergman, Hour Of The Wolf, wherein the dead return to prey on the living. Yet it also owes a debt to Jacques Tourneur's classic 1942 horror masterpiece Cat People.

  Yet, unlike that masterful film from two decades earlier, the characters in Kuroneko are never really more than archetypes in this film; but it works because this is not a realistic film, but an allegory on evil, vengeance and choosing one's enemies well, on both ends of the dilemma presented. The characters are merely instruments to affect and communicate an idea to the audience. However, despite their non-realistic overall personae, the characters often speak realistically, in terms of their emotive reactions, and this juxtaposition of the expected with the not so expected adds a psychological tension to the drama, in its schisms, that its actual narrative does not necessarily bear. And it's in these moments that Kuroneko occasionally laps at greatness, even if it never fully lashes its tongue about the quality. But, sometimes a good lick is all one needs.",1340236800,,1656,4.971119133574007
3848153,4,B0025FY928,"""Kuroneko"" AKA ""Yabu No Naka No Kuroneko"" (""The Black Cat from the Grove""), was from 1968 and directed by Kaneto Shindo. A film that was brooding in style and atmosphere (the cinematography and light and shadow effects were masterfully done), that concluded in an Orphic mystery-tale (the Japanese have similar allegories to explain our connection with the spirits of Nature). Now, what I've noticed with most reviews on this excellent and timeless work (that's why I had to add mine) they missed the story had a fundamentally strong anti-war message. Just like Kurosawa, Kaneto Shindo was taking the Japanese martial tradition to task (and for that matter, all martial societies) with a universal message on the evils of war, disguised as a ghost story. Now that's genius! And the Orpheus allegory served as a way to convey the principle of Love and the cycles of nature that supersede humankind's banal existence. As one of the reviewers already pointed out, I agree the film could have been slightly shorter, to make the best of its pace. Nevertheless, a superb film! The Criterion restoration was excellent.

It is beautiful to look at, but after about one hour, I found myself yawning.  The poor samurai has a problem: his mother and his wife have become ghosts with a sacred mission: to kill every samurai in the world, and drink their blood.  He suffers a lot (he even cries), but it never occurs to him that there are two obvious solutions to his problem:

The heroic solution:  find the black cat and kill it (that might harm the women's ghosts, though).

The common-sense solution: find another job (that would mean getting poor again, and wearing rags instead of nice clothes; but the women's ghosts would not be harmed).

Usually, when thoughts like that come to the viewer's mind, it means that the film is getting boring; it does.  The plot was good enough for a one-hour movie; 99 minutes is too much.",1338249600,7,849,4.5394736842105265

Back from war, our young man -- now a hero -- is recruited to hunt down these women who are themselves hunting down our young man's fellow samurai.

From such meager offerings Director Kaneto Shindo creates this 1968 movie.

We can't outrun our misdeeds. This lesson is apparent not only impaled by the women but also our young hero himself. Is he not numbered among the guilty for what happened to his mother and wife? It is this film's answer to that question that in my humble opinion more than the movie's eerie graphics contributes to its powerful sense of mood and enduring appeal.

3848157,5,B0025FY928,"Kuroneko (Black Cat)  should be revered in the same way that the early Universal monster pictures are.  Written and directed by Kaneto Shindo, it's a far better film than any of those but it was also made much later.  It's a gothic melodrama of the highest order that's cut from the same cloth.  For years, it's languished as a hard-to-find bootleg but now it's finally gotten the royal treatment from Criterion.  It's worth checking out if you're a fan of gothic horror.

The story is relatively simple.  Gintoki, played to perfection by Kichiemon Nakamura, has been conscripted into the military of a local warlord, leaving his wife and mother alone to tend their farm.  A gang of wandering ""samurai"" come upon the house and, for no reason except for their own savage desires, attack the two women.  They steal their food, rape them, and burn the house to the ground.  The only survivor is the family's small black cat.

This brutality sets the stage for the ghosts of the two women to seek vengeance, and they do so with great gusto.  Some of the samurai they dispatch were clearly among the men who did them in, but many were not.  The ghostly pair is the feudal Japanese equivalent of Jason Voorhees, drinking the blood of all samurai who cross their paths.

The young conscript, Gintoki, eventually returns from success on the battlefield and is made samurai and retainer of the local warlord.  He goes home to find the remains of his house but no other news about the whereabouts of his mother and wife.  Then he's given orders to find and destroy the ghosts responsible for the demise of so many samurai and thereby encounters his family once again.

The core of the film is the dilemma shared by Gintoki and his wife and mother.  Each has vowed to destroy the other and yet they want to be together again.  This makes for a positively Shakespearean tragedy, and one with many shades of meaning in a society that's well known for its rigid class structure and its respect for those who stay in line and do as they are told.  The pacing is slow and deliberate, but there's a lot here to love.

The film was shot in black and white by Kiyomi Kuroda, but the visuals are hardly boring.  There is a theatrical quality to the ghosts and their world that is rarely seen in films, even today.  The lighting is impeccable and serves to illustrate the differences between the world of the living and the world of the dead.  These are truly sumptuous visuals  and they really help propel the story in a lucid way.  The only downside is the abundant day-for-night photography present here, but there probably wasn't any other way to shoot large, outdoor scenes at the time.

The music, though sparsely used, is also pitch perfect for the story.  Hiraku Hayashi's score is so compelling that I wish there were more of it to hear.  He bridges the gap between Japanese classical and orchestral score in such a way that you never notice the shifts between the two.

If you like ghost stories, whether they be the stringy-haired variety of modern Japan or the classics from Universal and Hammer, you owe it to yourself to check out Kuroneko.  Very highly recommended.",1331942400,5,3159,4.627697841726619

3848159,5,B0025FY928,"Previous reviewers have justly praised this film at length, and I'm glad to add my praise to theirs. Simply put, this Japanese tale puts modern attempts at horror to shame. Filmed in gorgeous black & white, utilizing the most basic of special effects, and suffused with a powerful erotic & psychological current that strikes to the heart of the viewer, it draws you in deeper & deeper until the eerily still & silent end.

What makes it so memorable?

First of all, it offers strong characters with powerful, contradictory emotional drives. Torn between family, honor, religious & social demands, they recognize the trap they're in, one determined by outside forces they've internalized. Yet they're unable to resolve those contradictions & save themselves. This sense of the inexorable only grows stronger as the story progresses.

So our young farmer-turned-samurai is faced with the bloodthirsty ghosts of his wife & mother, who have vowed to destroy all samurai, but retain enough of their memories & humanity to want to spare him. For his part, he relishes his rise in social status, yet desperately wants to be reunited with his wife & mother, partly out of guilt for not being there to save them.

Then there's the cinematography & the bold direction of Kaneto Shindo, making superb use of dense masses of shadow & sudden pools of unearthly light. There's a minimum of gore & gratuitous shock; instead, the emphasis is on atmosphere & tension, brought to a slow & almost unbearable boil. It has a dreamlike quality, one that can turn from haunted beauty to outright nightmare in an instant. In a way, I'm reminded of Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- there's the same sense of some ancient folk tale retold in strangely intimate terms -- but where Cocteau properly brings his film to a deserved fairy tale conclusion, Shindo ventures into darker & more ambiguous territory.

As with his previous ""Onibaba"" (which is the perfect companion to ""Kuroneko""), Shindo's sympathies are with the women. For all their visual beauty, his films don't glamorize the samurai, or men in general. His concern is more with those who have to suffer the consequences of living in a world shaped by masculine hungers; thus even his historical films speak eloquently to the present.

Most highly recommended!",1326585600,20,2296,4.981723237597911
3848160,5,B0025FY928,"A mother and daughter-in-law are in their hut, eating, when the Samurai come.  These Samurai are not the clean minded, clean shaven, warriors on horse back, with polished swords and banners attached to their backs.  No, this are grunts.  Mud covered, half-naked, front line troops that want water, food, and women.  They swarm into the hut, taking what they want.  They leave, setting fire to the hut, a hut empty of food or life.
And so the ghost story begins with rape, murder and the family's black cat mewling next to two bodies.
The story is simple, tragic, lovely.  A wonderful piece of art that I bought from Amazon.com on a whim.  And I am so happy I did.  In some ways it reminds me a tad of Rashomon, as it suggests more than one view point or story is going on at the same time.  Or maybe it is because I can't help but feel sorry for the ghosts.  Or are they cat demons?
A Samurai is asked to kill the ghosts.  How will he handle it?  How do you kill ghosts?  And what happens if he decides the ghosts were once his own family...?

The bamboo forests are dark and foreboding places indeed, as two wronged women pick off unsuspecting samurai one by one. Kuroneko is one of the best of its kind. Criterion has done a fantastic job with this film. The video is clear and crisp- the audio is very good- extras are minimal but well worth it. Highly recommended Japanese horror.",1325462400,5,439,4.5
3848162,5,B0025FY928,"Also another important lesson: don't become a Samurai, or bloodthirsty spirits will KILL YOU!

Update: I purchased the Blu-Ray version when the price dropped to $19.99.  Worth every penny!

But perhaps the most important lesson here is:  watch this film!  Enjoy it for the amazing thrill ride that it is.  Kaneto Shindo directs this amazing piece of Japanese cinematic gold.  He is like the Japanese Tarantino, he never had any official training, just a love for films.  He actually read one of these 44 (or so) volume modern stage collections that took him over a year to finish.  Amazingly, he is one of very few people to actually have completed each and every volume in such short time.  But that is a testament to his style and character.  He learned for years under Mizoguchi, and looked up to the old master quite a bit.  Though he admits in documentaries and interviews (including one in this collection) that he and Mizoguchi disagreed about a lot of things, the old master was a major influence in Shindo's film life.  To sum it up: Mizoguchi said 'a flower cannot act' but Shindo says a flower can actually act, if one takes the time to notice.

The film is set in feudal Japan.  Enter starving deserters.  Starving deserters see a house.  House has food and women.  Deserters take what they want and burn the house and the women.  Enter black cat.  Begin creepy ghost story.

Without delving too much into the film and giving anything away, the two deceased women are possessed by a vengeful cat spirit.  They seem to retain some of their memories from when they were alive, but they form a pact with the evil underworld gods to kill and drink the blood of any samurai that cross the Rajomon gate.

First of all, the film is gorgeous.  Simply jaw dropping beautiful.  It has some to do with the amazing transfer and restoration of Criterion (though most late 60s films need less restoration than those pre 1960s.  But what really shines is the use of set and amazing lighting effects by Shindo and his amazingly talented crew.  Every detail is raked over with a fine tooth comb.  There is nothing extra or flabby about this film.  Every set, every scene, every line is important.  Shindo once spoke of Ozu and his respect for his films, and this kind of nitpicking directing shows.  Though perhaps he was not quite as neurotic as Orson Wells!

The film is a haunting ghost story, based on Noh and Kabuki theater; but at it's core it is a love story and a tale of loyalty and also of revenge.  The acting is pretty amazing.  Raiko's mustache could have a career all it's own as a porn star!  But we really see some terrific acting once Kichiemon Nakamura (Gintoki) enters the film.

It's a creepy yet not scary film that has a lot of depth and complexity.  It teaches us those important life lessons: never trust vengeful spirits, never escort 'lost' young ladies home in the middle of the night, don't go into creepy and remote villas with said 'lost' girls... or just don't become a samurai and it'll be all good.  But the old saying, ""never cross paths with a black cat"" doesn't apply here.  This is one black cat that deserves a part of any film fan's collection.

PS.  If you actually do have a black cat as a pet (I do), please be aware that said cat might take pleasure in suddenly appearing sitting on the arm of the couch next to you and startle the #*@^ out of you.",1324944000,2,3386,4.521452145214521
3848163,5,B0025FY928,"It has been a long, long time since I have seen a film and became so enthralled with it that I chose to watch the same movie the very next day.

The film begins with a view of a forest as white fog glides through the trees.  A kodo drum beats furiously...this changes to the sound of a cats' claw on a brick wall, then  the sound becomes an eerie rattle.  A quiet cottage by the edge of a bamboo glade is a scene of peace. Very silently, we see twenty poor samurai who emerge from the bamboo, drink like beasts from a spring, then discover the cottage, Inside the home are two peasant woman who farm for a living.  After stealing their food, gang raping and leaving the females for dead, the warriors maliciously burn the cottage to the ground.  Only a  black cat remains, licking at the womens' bodies.

These two women, a mother and her daughter-in-law, become cat spirits who can shape shift into their former selves, albeit with strange cat eyebrows.  In the next world, they pleaded with the god of evil to let them live as vampires so that they could wreak vengeance and bring death to all the samurai. Their aim is to lure the warriors into their forest home, seduce them, then tear out their throats. When victim and victim pile up, the cat spirits discover that the newest samurai they have targeted turns out to be the older woman's treasured son and the younger woman's dear husband.  Alas, alas, he has been given the difficult instruction by his lord to rid the land of the cat ghosts. How can he do this?

The black and white photography is moody, sensual, abstract, expressionistic...and absolutely sensational.  The contrast between pitch black and silver light creates a sense of the otherworld -  a technique perfectly suited to a ghost story.  But this film is really NOT a horror film - it is closer to a Kabuki theater piece or perhaps a morality play.  The difference between good and evil is ambiguous.

Consider just one scene - the ghosts' first victim is a samurai who had earlier been one of the men who raped and murdered them.  As he enters their magical home, the trees surrounding the house move as if on a round carousel.  The breeze creates ripples of sound - rustling leaves and whispers.  The director recreates a Grimm's Fairy Tale translated to Feudal Japan.

This one is a keeper...a film I wish to study for its magnificent effects. (Given the choice, DO select the Blu-Ray version).",1322179200,12,2422,4.549653579676674
3848164,5,B0025FY928,"This classic ghost story is a must for every true fan of cinema. I first got a chance to see it at the Fantasia film festival in Montreal and it stayed with me long after I left the theatre. Beautifully shot in black and white,the creative use of lighting, surprisingly effective special effects and haunting sound effects give the tragic love story a poetic presentation that litterally takes your breath away. As with most Criterion releases, the quality of the transfer is outstanding and the bonus features about the director are very interesting. Legends about Cat spirits haunting the world of the living are quite common in Japan, (The Grudge immediatly comes to mind), and I believe this is one of the earlier of this type put to film. If you like your fantastic cinema to be thoughtful and emotional this film is for you. Be warned however, this is not an action film. It is slow paced and reflective.",1322092800,3,910,4.69375
3848165,5,B0025FY928,"Edgar Allan Poe's famous story has the titular character getting its revenge at the end of the story. KURONEKO (black cat in Japanese), the second of director Kaneto Shindo's two great stylized horror films (after ONIBABA), has not one but two characters getting revenge not once but many times. A mother and her daughter-in-law are raped and murdered by a roaming band of samurai and then their house is burned to the ground. A black cat, who survives the fire, becomes the instrument of their revenge by being transformed into spirit likenesses of the dead women. Having sworn vengeance on all samurai, they then lure any who cross their path to a secluded grove where they seduce and then savagely murder them. The core of the story arises when an acclaimed samurai warrior, sent to destroy the evil spirits, turns out to be the son to one and husband to the other.

As he did in ONIBABA, director-screenwriter Shindo incorporates pungent social observation into Japanese myth especially on how women are treated and on the glorification of samurai culture. The helpless, victimized women of the opening are transformed into powerful, avenging agents of destruction while the samurai are depicted as proud, lustful, and stupid with the exception of the son who has issues of his own. Will he destroy the spirits of his mother and wife? Can they bring themselves to destroy him as they have sworn to do? These questions and others make KUROKENO food for thought as you watch one of the most beautifully stylized films that Japan has to offer. The black and white photography is crisp and vivid, the soundtrack is atmospheric and captivating, and the performances by the three principals are outstanding. If you enjoy Japanese cinema, then KUROKENO is a must see.",1321747200,2,1764,4.919463087248322

Its a haunting story that is tragic and romantic. Its also very sexy in its own way.

SO this movie seemed similar in style, and yes after finishing watching it it does have a a typically stylish ""charming"" tasteful feeling throughout the film. The concept is simple, the acting is decent and the visuals are stunning and dynamic for a black and white film. At times there seems to be a weird out of focus look to some of the shots, but I'm assuming that is just the way it was captured via whatever cameras they used. This is one of my new favorite films, I wouldn't call it scary, but there are a couple of gruesome moments, but very tame compared to many other horror films. It's almost Halloween and i bought this thinking it would put me in the fall mood, it worked and this movie is perfect for getting lost in an otherworldly ghost frame of mind.",1319241600,5,949,4.307262569832402

1969

Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration/preservation = five (5) stars; cinematography = four (4) stars; costume design = four (4) stars; stunts = solid three (3) stars; set design = barely three (3) stars; special effects = barely three (3) stars.  Director Kaneto Shindo (who is also credited as the writer) presents his take on an ancient supernatural folktale (circa post Heian) involving the rape and murder of two rural women (a wife and her mother in-law) by wandering samurai with the former promoted to ghost status to kill wandering (and any other) samurai.  Their pet black cat is nebulously mixed up in this process.  The plot thickens when the husband/son returns as a freshly minted samurai who begins wandering about searching for his missing relatives--and, of course, eventually finds their unreasonable facsimiles.  Shindo's photo-play does not telegraph (in advance) how plot points will turn out (unusual for filmed folklore), but the ending is not a happy one (which is the usual result for movies of this genre).  The Director's product might have made an excellent short.  Instead the film is overly long by a factor of at least three, and stretch marks and fillers can be seen just about everywhere: endless repetition of scenes; performances reduced to ""ghostly"" slow-motion acting; loads of horse-back riding to nowhere; etc.  Shindo seems unsure if he is making a motion picture or filming a stage play complete with spot-lite actresses.  As with most/all ghost tales invented by Buddhist monks way back when, this one smacks of sexism and the ""inherent evil"" of women.  (Apparently, deceitful, vengeful, dangerous, and murderous male ghosts were in short supply during ancient times!)  Restoration and cinematography (2.35 : 1, black and white) are excellent.  There are many fine tracking shots.  Costumes are minimal quantitatively but outstanding qualitatively.  Set design is pretty good especially sound-stage ""exteriors.""  Ghost effects are fairly primative (even by contemporary standards) and uneven; they mainly derive from in-camera, film processing, and editing techniques (multiple exposures often look phony, but the invisible foot cart that seems to have been used to enable actresses to travel unaided in front of trotting horses is a fine touch).  Stunt actors provide eye-opening flips and pirouettes.  Subtitles are close enough and signs usually translated.  Always keep a caffeinated beverage nearby with this one!

8351023,4,B0025FY928,"Pretty decent samurai ghost story, it's a tragic love story that has a rather unusual ending, and to be honest it might have been a better and more challenging film with a different ending.  Still, it's fairly decent for what it is.  If this had been made in the 80s or 90s with practical SFX, then this film would have really shined.  Fortunately it was made before the big CGI revolution in SFX technology, so although we see some primitive effects we still get some first class film making.

I don't know what it is about the Japanese and the Samurai genre, as I've yet to see a bad one (save maybe a few of the Lone Wolf and Cub films).  And this one is no different, but, like I say, the story could have taken a better turn and made this film a five star affair instead of the pretty good film that it already is.

Give it a shot.  It's got some mild black and white violence, but should be okay for most audiences.",1505952000,,921,4.198863636363637
