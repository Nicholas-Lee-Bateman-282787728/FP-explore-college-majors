5333831,4,B009GUSWDM,"I love Lucille Ball. I have seen all of her series except for ""Life with Lucy,"" and have been a fan for most of my life. I enjoyed most of the episodes in this set. Lucy was clearly repeating herself after 21 years on the air. The most bizarre episode is the one where Lucy Carter meets Lucille Ball. As Lucie Arnaz points out in the intro to episode that it was all basically a promo for Lucy's then upcoming movie, ""Mame."" (Lucy could not sing, yet she landed the starring role the musical, ""Mame""?) Mary Jane Croft is such an underrated supporting actress as Lucy's friend. She was a delight. This is a great dvd set for a family as there is nothing objectionable for youngsters.",1357171200,2,682,4.377952755905512
5333832,5,B009GUSWDM,"I can't believe that the final season of this Lucy classic is finally coming to dvd, and just before Christmas no less. Out of all the Lucy shows this one is my favorite I don't care what no one says. Lucy fans make sure you go out and get this so you can complete your collection, I know will.",1348876800,6,294,4.0
5333833,5,B009GUSWDM,"Season Six marked the final year of Lucille Ball in a regular television series and it was truly an end of an era.  Lucille Ball was the last performer from television's Golden Years to have a series in 1973-74.  However, Lucy's ending is bittersweet; Lucy wanted to end her show at the end of season five (during season five Lucy's show was still a Top 15 show and Lucy was still was number one in her timeslot) but CBS' Fred Silverman convinced her to come back for another season.  Lucy doing a sixth season was done more out of sentiment than desire.  She was still at the height of her career and was getting ready to film Mame.  Television comedy was changing with shows like All in the Family, MASH, Sanford & Son, Maude and Good Times and Lucy knew it.  She always knew when to get off.  The sixth season of ""Here's Lucy"" has many excellent episodes, i.e. ""Lucy Gives Eddie Albert The Old Song and Dance,"" ""Lucy & Joan Rivers Do Jury Duty,"" ""Lucy and Chuck Connors,"" ""Lucy Plays Cops & Robbers,"" ""Lucy is N.G. As R.N.,"" ""Lucy & Phil Harris,"" ""Lucy and Mary Jane's Boy Friend,"" ""Where Is My Wandering Mother,"" ""Lucy Carter Meets Lucille Ball,"" and ""Lucy Fights The System.""  However, season six was the weakest Lucy season and it was the first time that Lucy had fallen out of the Top 15 Shows.  She finished the 1973-74 season in 29th place with a 20.0 rating and 31% of audience.  During the first half of the 73-74 season Lucy was losing out to ABC's Monday Night Football, but during the second half of the season ""Here's Lucy"" did rebound in the ratings and was the number one show in its' timeslot at 9:00 pm.  Since Lucy really didn't want to do a sixth season and because comedy was changing on television, Lucy and CBS agreed to discontinue the series in the Spring of 1974.  It is rumored that CBS actually cancelled ""Here's Lucy"" but It was really a mutual agreement to end the show.  After 23 years on TV Monday night has never been and never will be the same.  Lucy is indeed the First Lady of Television and Queen of Comedy.  It's funny because comedy was changing in the 70's but today Lucy's comedy still endures and it proves it by the latest poll that voted ""I Love Lucy"" the Best TV Comedy and Best TV Show of all-time.  Lucy's second series ""The Lucy Show"" (the sixth and final season) will be released on October 9, 2012 and with the last season of Here's Lucy being released on December 18th 2012 we will have all of Lucy's shows on DVD.  I have to give CBS Home Entertainment and MPI Home Video thanks for all the love they have put into the DVD releases for all of Lucy's fans to enjoy.  Note:  Don't be surprised if you see a release of ""Life With Lucy"" (Lucy's short-lived 1986 ABC Comedy) released sometime during 2013.  ""Life With Lucy"" might have flopped but I think it would be great to have all of Lucy's series available to the public.",1348790400,20,2874,4.386792452830188
5333834,5,B009GUSWDM,"This is probably the one of the best seasons of ""Here's Lucy"" along with season four. Lucy in this season has become more mature than the ditzy redhead we saw in the first season. Her voice is lower, her dry since of humor is hilarious, and Harrison Carter(Gale Gordon) is amazing as usual!! Kim has grown up into a beautiful woman and has become Lucy's sidekick, much like in last two seasons. This season is must have!!",1348790400,5,421,4.48051948051948
5333835,5,B009GUSWDM,"Well, we can thank the good Lord and MPI for putting all seasons of Lucille Ball's last official series on DVD. On December, 18, 2012 (just in time for Christmas) ""Here's Lucy-The Offical 6th and Final Season"" arrives on DVD format making all of Lucy's CBS sitcoms available for home viewing (Lucy's ill-fated 1986 ABC sitcom probably will never see the light of day as it was poorly produced and killed by that network and is not in demand by Lucy fans).

 The final year of ""Here's Lucy"" (1973-1974) was a poor year for Lucille Ball as this marked the very first time one of her shows fell completely out of the Top 20 on the Nielsen charts. Fans chose ""Monday Night Football"" over Lucy making the series come in at a disappointing #29 on the year-end ratings. At the time it was announced by Lucy herself that she was quitting network television to pursue other projects, but the reality is CBS cancelled ""Here's Lucy"" due to bad ratings and attempt to attract a more urban audience with shows like ""All in The Family"" and ""M*A*S*H"". CBS went to Lucy (out of respect) and told her what they were going to do to her show and suggested that she publicly state she was retiring.

 The final year, like prevous seasons, had a huge array of guest-stars including Andy Griffith, Milton Berle, Arte Johnson, Joan Rivers and Chuck Connors.

5333836,5,B009GUSWDM,"At the end of Season 5 of Here's Lucy, Lucy made the decision to end the series when for the first time ever one of her shows fell out of the top ten ratings. At the last minute, CBS' President Fred Silverman convinced Lucy to change her mind and return for a 6th Season in 1973, as he felt being #15 was not too far out of the top ten. Lucy agreed, even though she also made a prior commitment to do the musical Mame that year. To get in shape for the musical Mame, after her fractured leg kept her from doing her famous physical comedy last season 5, Lucy worked out with a trainer daily. Lucy kept up with such a grueling schedule on getting her leg back in dancing shape, filming Mame and doing yet another Season 6 of Here's Lucy, that all this could not be believed from a woman 62 years old. Even though a young person couldn't keep up with Lucy's non stop schedule, Lucy's age and everyone else's age around her was beginning to show.

By the time Season 6 started filming, Lucy was in incredible shape from her workouts with her trainer. In Episode 5, The Bow Wow Boutique, Lucy's physical comedy is on top of her game again. In the next episode with Eddie Albert, she dances and sings Makin' Whoopie with Eddie, as if she is a girl in her twenties. Lucy also sings and dances with Phil Harris near the end of the season. How a 62 year old can film a musical and a television show at the same time after breaking her leg in 4 places just a year earlier, is beyond me. That is the true Lucy- a woman who could and did do anything with such a never ending abundance of energy. Sadly as you watch Lucy, you see an aging woman in her 60's who physically just doesn't know it.

As always, Here's Lucy Season 6 had loads of great guest stars. In the first show, Danny Thomas plays a painter Danny Galupe, who Lucy talks into playing dead, so his paintings will bring top dollar- the most expensive one being a painting of Lucy in the buff! A note on Danny Thomas- he was the only big star to attend Desi's funeral in 1986 and at the end of this first episode when he says to Lucy- I REALLY Like You - you can feel it's for real. Danny was a grateful friend to the end. You'll also see O.J. Simpson, Steve Lawrence and Edie Gourmet, Ed McMahon, Bob Williams' Dog Act, Eddie Albert, Reta Shaw, Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester), Andy Griffith, Joan Rivers, Foster Brooks, Frankie Avalon who does a Sonny and Cher imitation with Lucie Arnaz that is really great!, Chuck Connors, Dick Sargent, Al Lewis, Arte Johnson, Don Porter (Gidget's dad), Milton Berle, Phil Harris, Mary Winters and more. Of course, Lucy's wonderful sidekicks Gale Gordon and Mary Jane Croft are in almost every episode, along with appearances from daughter Lucie Arnaz, Mary Wickes, Gary Morton, Carole Cook and Doris Singleton. A note on Doris Singleton, who most of you remember as Carolyn Appleby on I Love Lucy. Who can't forget Lucy's friend Carolyn who constantly compared her perfect son Stevie to the inferior Little Ricky! Doris was one of only two women who Lucy trusted completely, because Desi never hit on her due to his respect for her husband. The other woman who Desi never bothered was Mary Jane Croft, also due to his respect for her husband. Lucy trusted and kept these 2 women in her shows for her entire life. Doris Singleton recently passed away on June 28th, 2012 at the age of 92. May she receive as much happiness in the after life as she gave to us here on earth.

Lucy also used this Season 6 to promote her movie Mame. Near the end in episode 22, Lucy Carter Meets Lucille Ball, the real Lucille Ball's perfume sponsor Mais Oui, holds a look alike contest. Kim tells mother Lucy she is a dead ringer for Miss Ball and should enter, which she does. The funniest scene is when real life hubby Gary Morton kisses Lucy Carter, thinking she is Lucille! There is lots of fun this season, with the Mame promotion and great talented guest stars that you won't want to miss. Sadly, with everyone aging now into their 60's, it will be the last Season of Here's Lucy, which Lucy already saw coming last season 5, when CBS convinced her to try just one more season. When CBS saw the ratings plummet down to #29, they knew the series was over, and chose not to renew Lucy's contract for a seventh year.

Here's Lucy's last 1973-74 season ended Lucy's being on television for almost a straight 23 years. The truth being, that everyone on Lucy's shows were from television's age of innocence of a past that was a much simpler time. They had aged and could not compete with the number one more realistic shows of All In The Family, Mary Tyler Moore, Mash and others. The funniest thing is that now in 2012, the GREATEST TELEVISION SHOW OF ALL TIME is I LOVE LUCY. Since television's first shows began after WWII, to entertain the new families in the privacy of their own homes, with the thousands and thousands of shows we've watched over 6 decades, Lucy is our favorite, most trusted entertainer, who we just can never get enough of.  Lucy's spirit had a hard time aging, because maybe she knew that she would entertain us forever and remain forever young with us in the privacy of our own homes. Even after 6 decades of television, Lucy remains our favorite of all time, which shows that what remains close to our hearts are the innocent, much simpler times of the past- which Lucy always brought to us for almost 23 years straight.

The era of innocent television in 1974 was over, but thanks to MPI Home Video under license from Desilu,Too and Lucille Ball Productions, we can enjoy the simple wonderful television of Here's Lucy whenever we want on dvd! So for that I cannot express my gratitude enough to MPI and Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr.- YOU ALL ARE JUST THE GREATEST to complete our Lucy shows for us diehard fans! I wish you all the happiness in the world, as you've given so much happiness to all of us with your tireless work on getting these dvd's made and with so much bonus material too! The bonus material is not to be missed on this last season, it is that fantastic! Lucy is on Dinah Shore's Show, where she thinks she will be promoting Mame, but instead the show turns into a This Is Your Life type format- with Lucy's Mom, Daughter, Vivian Vance and more! The love between Vivian and Lucy can be felt and you can see why these two were so perfect together for so many years! Lucie and brother Desi Jr. tell great stories- Lucie tells she wants to do her own book very soon- you know this will be fabulous! There are home movies and so much more- a perfect ending to a perfect series! THANK YOU ALL A MILLION!

5333881,4,B009GUSWDM,"This one is a little bittersweet for me. We all know that it was the final of 18 seasons of successive and successful Lucille Ball television seasons. By this time, Desi, Jr., had left the show, and Lucille was forced to slow down a bit due to a skiing accident that left her with a broken leg, leaving Lucie to carry much of the show. Nothing wrong with that, as Lucie Arnaz inherited an incredible amount of talent from both of her parents. Still, you can tell, this was the end of an era. But, it's Lucy, and nothing tops that, and for the most part I prefer Here's Lucy to The Lucy Show. I was allowed to stay up late Monday nights to watch Here's Lucy, because my mother trusted her to entertain me with wholesome material. And, the curtains in the background of the cover shot seem to shout ""1974"" more loudly than a CBS screenshot of the phrase, ""The President Resigns"".",1399334400,,877,4.353658536585366

After 5 seasons, for the first time, Lucy completely dropped out of the Top 20. She was so depressed, that she wanted to cancel the show after 5 seasons.

  But, a friend informed her that the ratings weren't that bad, and convinced her to try with another season. After Season 6 aired, the ratings dropped even more, so Lucy decided to end the show. Even though this season wasn't as good as others, I am glad to have it, and glad she decided to make another season. I Love Lucy, and everything she has done. She is a remarkable person, and at peace in Heaven. RIP Lucy! We love you!",1364515200,4,789,4.3175675675675675

5333918,5,B009GUSWDM,"If you love Lucy, you'll love the last season of her final CBS show.  Desi Arnaz, Jr had long checked out by this time and Lucie Arnaz only appears in a few episodes herself.  While a little too reliant on guest stars, its still an enjoyable watch.  I don't know how exactly many cigarettes Ms. Ball inhaled, but you can almost hear her voice getting raspier with each episode!",1360022400,2,377,4.434782608695652
5333919,5,B009GUSWDM,I've always been a Lucy fan and own all of the Lucy Show and Here's Lucy dvds. MPI did a great job with the transfers on season 6 as they have also done with the previous seasons. There's also quite a nice list of bonus features on the set. If you're a fan of the Here's Lucy series I don't think you'll find anything on this last season set to complain about.,1359936000,6,360,4.013888888888889
5333920,5,B009GUSWDM,"Here it is, the last full season of ""Here's Lucy.""  With this beautifully remastered collection, we now have every episode of all three classic Lucille Ball shows: ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Lucy Show,"" and ""Here's Lucy"" on DVD.

Is ""Here's Lucy"" as good as ""I Love Lucy?"" Not really, but that would be almost impossible, as ""I Love Lucy"" is one of the best sitcoms of all time (if not the absolute best).  ""The Lucy Show"" also has many enjoyable moments (especially seasons 1-3), but ""Here's Lucy"" has never really received much love critically, which seems unfair.

It must be mentioned that ""Here's Lucy"" got better with each year that it was on the air. In fact, Seasons 4-6 are arguably funnier than the first few seasons, especially because two of the original ""I Love Lucy"" writers came back to do many of the scripts. Plus, we have an incredible assortment of guest stars.  Lucy looks somewhat older in Season Six (and her voice is quite low), but her timing was still perfect. Some of the scenarios are priceless, and her daughter Lucie Arnaz offers especially strong support in Season Six.

Some of my favorite episodes in this set are: ""Lucy's Tenant,"" ""Lucy and Joan Rivers Do Jury Duty,"" ""Lucy Plays Cops and Robbers,"" and ""Lucy is N.G. as an R.N.""  But it's the last three shows: ""Lucy Carter meets Lucille Ball,"" ""Where is my Wondering Mother Tonight?,"" and ""Lucy Fights the System"" that are among the most solid of the entire series!  Since they were so well done, it's almost a shame they didn't come back for another season.

Watch this set, and enjoy a true piece of television history.  So many of the Lucy shows still hold up well today, and it's a little bittersweet to get to the end here. After 23 years as the Queen of Comedy, Lucy demonstrates yet again with Season Six that there will never be another star like her.",1358985600,6,1836,4.587155963302752
5333921,5,B009GUSWDM,"While I am thrilled that this completes my collection of all of Lucy's TV shows, it's also a reminder that, just like it did in 1974 when it went off the air, Lucy's incredible reign had reached it's end. But with so much wonderful material put out during an astonishingly long 23-year run, we'll have these DVD's to watch so many classic moments over and over again...",1358640000,4,369,4.522388059701493

8541345,3,B009GUSWDM,"The last season of ""Here's Lucy"" and the last season of any Lucy series ever...(I refuse to even acknowledge Zombie Lucy on Life with Lucy.) The show actually gets better in its later years...as Lucy is clearly sick of it all and just says her Lucy Carter lines as if she is what she probably was, a cranky old broad who is annoyed she had to put down her brown drink and her cigarette to come on stage and do the same old same old. The show is less cartoony then the earlier years and Lucy gets back to being smarter...(which is probably why as a little kid I liked the show less as time went on. They soften the Gale Gordon characters so he is not always yelling but the show is the same as every Lucy show post ILL...everyone standing around yelling their lines at the top of their lungs and the jokes are all duds. Lucie Arnaz is cute and is much better in the later years and she makes the best Lucy partner in crime since Viv.  Unfortunately Mary Jane Croft is still on the show whining her every line..(I am convinced Mary Jane last as long as she did as he knew how to duck when Lucy was throwing things off stage.)  Still, a sad capstone to her TV series. CBS was just glad to get rid of her as they didn't even do an hour long finale..its some dumb episode that doesnt even have Lucy on that much! If they had any respect they would have had someone buy Harry's business (for about the 50th time) and the last scene Lucy meets her new boss...and it Desi..coming out of the door cursing at her in Spanish like the good old days!",1517443200,,1537,4.171717171717172
