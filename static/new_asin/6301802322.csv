While 80s movies tend to feel very dated today, some cross the threshold. This one is just attrocious. The most sexist movie of them all. Terrible acting. Lazy writing.

It was not exactly what you would expect in regards to shrink wrap as with a movie you would purchase at a store: slightly lesser quality job of shrinkwrap, no tamperproof stickers, etc. Opened the case and very carefully removed the disc so that I could inspect. Observed numerous faint distinct scratches on the back of the disc, no less than 7 individual scratches in total. Attempted to photograph the scratches but they did not photograph well enough to post an image due to glare and reflection.",1513814400,,605,4.9411764705882355

371282,5,6301802322,"This movie came out over thirty years ago but is still a funny and endearing story, of a boy who loses girl, tries repeatedly to end it all and fails comically, meets another girl who fixes his car, encourages him, and helps him accomplish what once seemed impossible. But don't watch it for that. Watch it for all the supporting characters: his best friend Charles DeMar, his little brother Badger, Johnny the paper boy, his arch nemesis Roy Stalin, his neighbor Ricky, the Chinese twins who haunt every stoplight, and others. Oh yeah, and the music! Sure, it screams 1980s from the top of the K-12, but it's good stuff! Elizabeth Daly was a pretty popular singer and actress back then (Valley Girl, Pee Wee's Big Adventure), and she makes a guest appearance at their high school prom and sings a couple songs.

The Blu-Ray brings the original film to your home with excellent color and clarity. The first time I watched this was in 1986, on VHS, and this looks so much better than I ever remembered it. The animated scenes pop with vivid color, and the original 35mm print seems to have been given the white glove treatment during the digital transfer to yield a high-quality 1080p rendering. It isn't a big-budget sci-fi film, so don't expect something to just blow your socks off visually, but the picture has held up very well over the years.",1512000000,2,1347,4.659663865546219

371326,5,6301802322,"Lane Meyer (Cusack) has the entire standard (only if they are yours not so standard) problems and people to put up with. He has a car (if he puts it together.) He has a mother that makes boiled bacon and many other delicacies. The standard mix of schoolmates and a love problem. Naturally everything is going down hill until the neighbors bring in a female French exchange student. Will she be able to get him out of his slump or cause more anguish so that he would be ""Better Off Dead""?
It is all the little things that you can relate to and the fantasy scenes that make the movie. They are to numerous to mention here but many people after watching this movie have a tendency to look at each other and say,

Easily one of the most refreshing teen comedies ever committed to film, Better Off Dead features John Cusack as Lane Myer, a jilted, angst-ridden high schooler whose multiple suicide attempts fail miserably, to great comic effect. This decidedly black angle, in the cheery years of Ronald Reagan's second term (1985), gave this conventionally plotted flick a patina of post-punk nihilism and may have scared some ticket buyers away. But those who have come to love it from repeated TV and video airings know that this film, writer-director ""Savage"" Steve Holland's first, is sweet and genuine despite its darker trappings. Cusack, an awkward 18-year-old when this was filmed, embodies the Everyteen -- surrounded by idiots, unable to catch a break, and utterly devastated when his girlfriend, Beth (Amand Wyss), dumps him in favor of the far more handsome and popular ski team captain, Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier). When she explains her decision to hook up with Stalin without mincing words (oh, and she says his car's nicer, too), you're ready to follow poor Lane right over the brink. Holland surrounds Lane with hilarious caricatures while punctuating the action with dream/fantasy sequences that underscore his hapless lot, but he affords a glimmer of hope in the cute French exchange student living across the street from Lane. Yes, Better Off Dead slips back into teen-movie conventions with the inevitable Stalin-Myer downhill ski race in the last reel, but for 85 or so minutes it's a breakneck run that you'll want to try again.",1453939200,,1716,4.989510489510489
372507,5,6301802322,Still as funny as I remember. It is certainly dated but it doesn't detract from the story itself. It was an over-the-top movie with plainly exaggerated scenes so a little bit of dating isn't bad. So many quotable lines!,1453593600,,219,4.641025641025641

372510,5,6301802322,"A young John Cusack headlines this romantic teen comedy.

While I enjoy Cusack as an adult actor, I absolutely loved his work during is early years.

""Savage"" Steve Holland makes his mark on the 1980s as he crafts a film from the point of view of high school students.  Cusack is jilted by his HS girlfriend and the world takes on a very strange perspective...Cusack is obsessed with his now ex-girlfriend and he's willing to pretty much anything to regain her attention and win her back.  In the meantime a French foreign exchange student moves in with a family who lives across the street.

We are introduced to the HS world as Cusack ponders different ways to reestablish his prominence with his exgirlfriend.  Meet the jocks, the nerds, cheerleaders, etc.

This is an absolutely hilarious romp.

Boy meets girl. Boy looses girl to better skier. Boy becomes better skier. Boy races Asian who sounds Howard Cosell. Boy meets new (French) girl. Girl helps boy rebuild his '68 Camaro. Boy doesn't want old girl that started the whole story.

This is about a guy struggling with work, his parents, his brother, and the paperboy.

It is hysterical and is the film that put Cusack on the map. There's Van Halen in the soundtrack, to boot!

373144,1,6301802322,"Better off Dead
classic 80's comedy with very young John cusack
still very funny today 30 years on
the original DVD release had no extras anyway except for Theatrical trailer

well Paramount pictures have reissued this film again on blu-ray now
and Paramount has given no respect to film at all, no new special features either on this new blu-ray version
this film deserves a new retrospective featurette at least
with new interviews with Director Steve Holland, John cusack, Curtis Armstrong,
Actress,Diane franklin, actress Amanda wyss, Kim Darby
but of course Paramount did not bother getting new special features for this new blu-ray
which i think is a very big insult to the film and the films fans

but i can say the picture quality is more sharper & clearer than the old dvd release from 2003
and a new 5.1 master audio mix had been added
so if you just want to upgrade the picture quality from your old DVD copy than waste your money on this blu-ray
apart from that there's zero special features so i think it's pointless buying it
1 star i gave it cause of no new extras at all same as the old DVD release",1423180800,,1114,4.537313432835821

Of course, like so many American comedies, there is a slight need to check your brain when you hit play.  The jokes often rely on outlandish and way over-the-top leaps of illogic, but that is part of the fun.

I won't talk too much about the plot mostly because knowing doesn't help much.  John Cusack shines as Lane Myer, the high school senior who loses his girlfriend at the start of the school year and suffered a multitude of increasingly implausible indignities and flights of fantasy while wondering why he is alive.

The supporting cast does very well in their roles, supporting the insanity on the screen while never quite breaking up into hysterical laughter.

Lots of interesting folks here-- Kim Darby (remember her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRUE-GRIT/dp/B000O179FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRUE GRIT</a>, from 1969?) as John's eccentric mom, whose cooking fetish manifests in bizarre meals; his kid brother (Scooter Stevens)-- the expert in mail-order mayhem; his dad (David Ogden Stiers), truly a man on a mission: to keep the garage door windows from breaking!

Beyond the family circle we have Lane's best pal, oddball Charles De Mar (Curtis Armstrong) and his top hat-- Charles likes to carry a pig fetus in a formaldehyde jar and snort real snow off a mountainside.

More weirdos: loudmouth next door neighbor Mrs. Smith (Laura Waterbury) and her porcine geekoid son Ricky (Dan Schneider). Mama keeps forcing Ricky on their foreign exchange student visitor from France, Monique Junot (Diane Franklin), who pretends to not know English to avoid having to speak to the Smiths. Monique is the ultimate key to Lane's rise from the ashes of Dumped Boyfriendville.

As if he didn't have enough worries, Lane's steps are dogged by a pair of Japanese brothers (one sounds like Howard Cosell) who seem to pop up at every red light to challenge Lane to a drag race. They're played by Yuji Okumoto and Brian Imada. Then there's Johnny Gasparini (Demien Slade), the newspaperboy from hell-- Lane doesn't have the two bucks his family owes for 20 papers and he can't shake this annoyance, not even when Johnny and bike fall off a snow-covered cliff.

Lane's ex, Beth Truss (Amanda Wysss) is now dating school jock Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier) and everyone from a math teacher (Vincent Schiavelli) to the mailman (Taylor Negron) to Barney Rubble (Rich Little) ask Lane's permission to have a shot at Beth. These importunings drive him from sadness to despair, and in a moment of macho insanity Lane dares Roy to ski race him down killer slope K12.

374039,4,6301802322,"Starring an in-his-element John Cusack, there's no question why this one's still remembered so fondly today: it's a great embodiment of everything one could expect to see from a zany '80s teen-geared comedy. Although Cusack plays his role with a typically dark slant (and many of the jokes are similarly themed), the film's general outlook is upbeat and silly, which makes for a tasty pairing. Occasionally it ventures too far into the realm of the absurd, such as the scene where Cusack's character daydreams a romancing pair of claymation cheeseburgers (which, naturally, pantomime to Van Halen), but it's also those dalliances into surrealism that provide many of its best moments. Funny as both a dated glimpse at life in the mid-eighties and a timeless relation to teenaged heartbreak, it's enriched by a sweet romantic subplot and a vast array of colorful supporting characters.",1372204800,,884,5.188811188811189

because John Cusak is very good in everything he does, and the Leonard Maltin book
gives it a fair rating.  It's funny now and then, and some of the visual gags are very funny, but
the writer/director just isn't clever enough when it comes to humor, I'd say. A better writer could have
made this a much better film.  But it's interesting to see
John Cusak in this early film, when he was a teenager.  So I'm glad that I bought it - but I'm not adding

374381,5,6301802322,"An `80s cult classic has reached Blu-Ray at last: Savage Steve Holland's high school comedy BETTER OFF DEAD, which I recall being released not once but twice locally in my home state of Rhode Island during 1985.

The first time was a late August trial run before its eventual October nationwide roll-out, which boasted a different ad campaign (this happened again for no apparent reason years later with ""The Lawnmower Man,"" which opened three weeks ahead of time in the Ocean State than it did around the rest of the nation. For what it's worth, we were also the only market that received a theatrical run of Larry Cohen's ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" too).

John Cusack netted his first lead role here as Lane Meyer, a typical high schooler who loses the girl of his dreams to an obnoxious jock -- and spends the rest of his life trying to summon the will to go on. Naturally, he does, winning the affection of a beautiful French exchange student trapped with an insane family next door, and attempting to beat the pretty boy ski team captain at his own game.

The plot may sound familiar but Holland -- who wrote and directed the film -- throws in absurdist humor, stop-motion animation, and knowingly satirizes high school in one memorable scene after another. My favorite sequence comes when Cusack is called upon to answer a geometry question in Vincent Schiavelli's class, filled with suck-up geeks who laugh at the teacher's every move (it definitely wasn't hard for me to identify with the young protagonist in this scene -- it's something you've had to have lived through to understand!). Curtis Armstrong is hysterical as Cusack's wacky best friend, Diane Franklin is ideal as the cute French girl, while David Ogden Stiers is great as Cusack's befuddled dad -- the sequences with Cusack and Stiers reacting to mom Kim Darby's Christmas presents is yet another gem in a film filled with smart observations and big laughs.

CBS' Blu-Ray of ""Better Off Dead"" looks terrific. There's a bit of dirt and noise here and there but the image itself is freed from any heavy use of DNR. The movie's 5.1 DTS MA track seems to have been remixed from a mono source as a lot of it sounds flat, but it's fine overall, and the original trailer is included. Hopefully Warner will get to a Blu-Ray edition of ""One Crazy Summer,"" this film's semi-sequel, sooner than later!",1337817600,2,2362,4.711864406779661

(btw both staring John Cusack) I've searched and searched for this movie for a long time since my old vhs tape finaly died 4 or 5 years ago... lo and behold I find it here on Amazon! So buy this dvd and you will enjoy it possibly reliving your childhood as I did every time I watched it.

374416,5,6301802322,"Okay so maybe this film has already achieved cult status. Not only does it star John Cusak in one of his early leading roles, the director (Savage Steve Holland) disappeared from feature films after this and ONE CRAZY SUMMER only to delve into TV directing. Fans miss him and I include myself in that mix. So what's the movie like? Completely off the wall and hilarious.

Cusak stars as Lane Myer, a teen obsessed with his girlfriend Beth (Amanda Wyss). Proof of that is shown early on when we see his closet filled with clothes hung on hangers that each feature a picture of Beth as well as walls covered with her picture. Problems start early on when Lane fails to make the ski team due to the underhanded doings of Roy, the stereotypical jock jerk found in so many movies. To make matters worse, Beth dumps Lane to become Roy's new girlfriend since she decides she needs to step up the social ladder.

Despondent, Lane can't figure out a way to get Beth back and so decides to kill himself. Not since HAROLD AND MAUDE have we witnessed the dark humor of attempted suicide. No, that's not a funny topic but when you see Cusak with a rope around his neck deciding not to go through with it only to have his mother (Kim Darby) open the garage door while sweeping knocking him off his stool to struggle...well you get the picture I hope.

Lane finally decides that the best way for him to win back Beth is to take on the ultimate challenge, the one hill only the best skiers go down. That's because most end up hospitalized. Lane doesn't quite go there but he doesn't conquer the slope either.

As this story is unfolding Lane also gets to see his next door neighbor, the nerdy overweight Ricky (Dan Schneider) doing well. In an attempt to get him a girl Ricky's mother has taken on a foreign exchange student, Monique (Diane Franklin). The problem is Monique has no interests whatsoever in Ricky. And one night she and Lane become friends.

The film ends with a final duel between Lane and Roy. Will Lane get Beth back? Will Roy stop being a jerk finally? And what about Lane's best friend Charles (Curtis Armstrong)? Will he finally find something interesting to do or the recreational drugs he seeks in this town?

The movie relies on the most absurd things happening for laughs and each and every one of them works. To tell you most would ruin your enjoyment of this film but I'll give you a couple without wrecking them. Remember to always pay your paperboy even if you only owe him two dollars. Never put flammable materials on a dining room table. And if a Cosell sound alike oriental pulls up in a car beside you be ready to race.

This movie was pretty much what many teen films in the 80's were all about. Teen angst taken to extreme. But rather than follow the John Hughes pattern of taking these teens seriously, Holland decided in his first feature film directing to make them over the top. And it works hilariously.

The film is just now hitting stores in blu-ray format. Does it help it any? Sadly no. The film continues to have a grainy look to it but that's the look it had when it was originally released. We can't expect every film from the past to look pristine in all forms. But for fans of the film having it in blu-ray will be something they'll want to add to their collection. Sadly the extras are non-existent. There is nothing new here. It would have been nice to bring Cusak back to talk about his early years making this film before he became the star he is today. In any event, this is one movie that should be on every collector's shelf. It is a film that you'll find yourself quoting and on occasion popping out to watch over and over again.",1332201600,,3671,4.436201780415431

374423,4,6301802322,"I don't know what people were expecting to see or hear with Better Off Dead on blu-ray. High definition does not translate to a miraculous transformation. It simply allows you to experience more closely what the source elements have to offer. In the case of Better Off Dead, it had a very low budget and was made very quickly. The filmmakers weren't concerned with how great the shots could be artistically, since it's a screwball comedy for teenagers. The low quality 80's film stock that was used wasn't great with detail, depth, or color, and was quite unstable. The film's soundtrack, which was originally in mono, was created with basic sound effects and design, because that's all the budget allowed for. The film will never look amazing no matter how much restoration is done to it and it'll never sound amazing unless an entirely new sound mix with new sound effects is created. It is a product of its low budget source limitations and unless you accept that fact, you will be greatly disappointed.

On the positive side, the print is clean and full of natural film grain. It's the best I've ever seen it look. The sound is exactly as it has always been, thin, lifeless and limited in range, though dialogue is always intelligible. The downside of this release is there are no special features. No retrospective, or appreciation, or commentary. I'm not surprised considering how limited the fan base is for the film.

This is the best presentation of Better Off Dead to date and I'm sure it could never be much better than it is on blu-ray. Adjust your expectations accordingly.",1312675200,79,1586,4.763636363636364

Now for the Blu-Ray. I am very disappointed in this Blu-Ray. The sound is awful! I'm no audiophile and I'm not sure how to describe it in words. The dialog just doesn't sound realistic. The best way for me to say it is that they always sound like they are talking in a warehouse (even when they are in a small room like a kitchen or outdoors).

374457,5,6301802322,"""Better Off Dead"" is the debut of ""Savage"" Steve Holland, a story loosely based on Savage's own life as a youth dealing with frustration, depression, and unrequited love. These are dark, somber themes, but for some reason, they can collude into a very funny film, one for the ages.

""Better Off..."" starts off with, after a brief animated sequence by Holland, the early morning hours of the Myer household; Lane (John Cusak) arising from his bed amid literally hundreds of pictures of the girl of his dreams, Beth (Amanda Weiss). His father (David Ogden Stiers) is stirring out of bed in a bit of a rush to get outside and open the garage door before the newspaper is delivered, as the carrier has a history of breaking the windows on the garage door by carelessly throwing the rolled-up paper at the house, invariably smashing the all garage door's windows. Like several scenes in the film, the pacing, camera angles, and soundtrack are very good parodies of old Hitchcock-type horror films. The comic effect is priceless.

Lane's mother, portrayed by Kim Darby, is a very nice, easy-going lady who is completely incompetent when it comes to preparing meals, and her creations, comprised of inedible messes, appear several times throughout, such as this disgusting greenish blue glop she says is bacon she boiled to avoid creating grease. Nasty, but hilarious. She's a sweetheart, but has no business in the kitchen.

David Schneider is Ricky Smith, the freak of nature living next door, the only child of a chain-smoking caricature of the prototypical overbearing mother. Friendly, but obnoxious and completely inconsiderate, she smothers her precious misfit son with affection and has sheltered him from the world, and when they celebrate Christmas, Ricky's gift to the foreign exchange student living there is quite funny, yet pathetic. The French foreign exchange student, Monique (Diane Franklin) is a sympathetic character, trapped in the Smith home and forced to pretend she doesn't speak a word of English to avoid interacting with these people. She's pretty, she's resourceful, and she has developed an interest in her new neighbor Lane, but Lane is heartbroken over Beth dumping him for ski captain Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier). Stalin is a real jerk; he's boorish and self-centered, and woefully, all too typical. So there is a double love-triangle here, as Lane wants to get back with Beth, who is now with Roy. Ricky desires Monique, who wants to be with Lane, who, as I said, wants to get back with Beth.

Every nuance of this film is perfectly placed, the songs in the soundtrack, the lives of the characters, the references to other film genres, and the type-casting of many of the characters, main, and incidental. For instance one will remember the owner of the hamburger stand as Porky, from the ""Porky's"" films of the era, and Curtis Armstrong, from ""Revenge Of The Nerds."" And ""Beth's"" biggest claim to fame is the distinction of being the first of Freddy Kruger's victims in the ""Elm Street"" series. This film is literally everything from the middle 1980s, a golden time for movie fans, especially the comedies and horror films of that time. I didn't realize it until much later, but this was a special time for this, as so many of today's remakes prove.

This is seriously one of the funniest, most uplifting films I have ever seen.",1311033600,,3353,4.9379432624113475

His mom cooks sea creatures and other weird creatures for dinner. He gets a job at the burger-joint but his boss doesn't like him that much. He goes to the school dance and finds the beautiful french girl there who finds him very attractive and appreciates his well-being. So Lane should be a lucky guy to have her. So he should get over with Beth and just focus on someone who is more loyal to him than she.
Oh and don't forget the lovely Elizabeth Daily who sung at the school dance with a lovely voice. She's one heck of a singer that I totally admire for her talent. How could anyone forget her?! Well, she should never be forgotten cause she's my idol!

Beyond the family circle we have Lane's best pal, oddball Charles De Mar (Curtis Armstrong) and his top hat-- Charles likes to carry a pig fetus in a formaldehyde jar and snort real snow off a mountainside.

More weirdos: loudmouth next door neighbor Mrs. Smith (Laura Waterbury) and her porcine geekoid son Ricky (Dan Schneider). Mama keeps forcing Ricky on their foreign exchange student visitor from France, Monique Junot (Diane Franklin), who pretends to not know English to avoid having to speak to the Smiths. Monique is the ultimate key to Lane's rise from the ashes of Dumped Boyfriendville.

As if he didn't have enough worries, Lane's steps are dogged by a pair of Japanese brothers (one sounds like Howard Cosell) who seem to pop up at every red light to challenge Lane to a drag race. They're played by Yuji Okumoto and Brian Imada. Then there's Johnny Gasparini (Demien Slade), the newspaperboy from hell-- Lane doesn't have the two bucks his family owes for 20 papers and he can't shake this annoyance, not even when Johnny and bike fall off a snow-covered cliff.

Lane's ex, Beth Truss (Amanda Wysss) is now dating school jock Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier) and everyone from a math teacher (Vincent Schiavelli) to the mailman (Taylor Negron) to Barney Rubble (Rich Little) ask Lane's permission to have a shot at Beth.

374602,4,6301802322,"John Cusack has had a marvelous career and continues to improve his talent, more in dramatic roles like ""1408"" these days. As a young man he played in a number of comedies and this is certainly a good one. When his girlfriend breaks up with him he thinks it's the end of the world. The fact that just about everything in his room has her picture on it let's us in on the fact he may be slightly over the edge. To say he was slightly obsessed with her is putting it mildly. Eventually he meets a foreign exchange student and she helps him through his crisis. Her reason for seeking out John is twofold. She thinks he's funny and the family she is living with is mental. The mother wants her to be her sons girlfriend and he still plays with dolls and would give Porky Pig a run for his money at the food trough. When it looks like John will get his old girlfriend back we see the age old question of the two ""H's"", hormones or honesty. Fun movie especially for fans of 80's movies. Good quality DVD, but no extras. Good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Say Anything"" and ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"".

On the day of try-outs, Lane is unjustly excluded from his school's ski team and dumped by Beth for the obnoxious jock who was responsible. Lane half-heartedly contemplates suicide while being harassed by the neighborhood paper boy, freaked out by his well-meaning parents, and humiliated at every turn. He's so caught up in winning Beth back that he doesn't at first notice Monique (Diane Franklin), a French exchange student staying next door with some trying domestic problems of her own.

This 1980s teen comedy unfortunately doesn't live up to the darkly comic promise of its title. Lane's flirtation with suicide is fleeting and accidental. His experiences are presented subjectively, not literally. We see what Lane imagines as well as what might actually be there. This sounds like a good set-up for absurdist humor, and Lane is an appealing character. But all other characters are one-dimensional caricatures whose roles in the story seem unlikely. They fall flat. Lane's rival Roy (Aaron Dozier) does nothing more than call him names. Granted, ""Better Off Dead"" is from Lane's point of view. But the humor is watered down and lacks the punch necessary to make good on its premise.

374688,4,6301802322,"I think John Cusack is great.  I love his comic timing and his deadpan stares.  Cusack plays Lane Meyer, an average guy who craves the limelight but is afraid to take a chance.  Dumped by the girlfriend Beth (Amanda Wyss) about whom he is obsessed (reference the view of his closet where every hanger displays a picture of Beth) after being cheated out of a spot on the school ski team by Ski Team Captain, Roy Stalin, (who also steals Beth), Lane sets about on a course of alternately trying to win her back and self destruction.  Along the way, he becomes acquainted with the French foreign exchange student, Monique, who is living with his creepy neighbor and pretending not to be able to speak English.  Monique helps Lane to believe in himself and in the end, Lane defeats Stalin in a ski race and wins the right girl, Monique.

What makes this film so humorous are the side characters.  His father, superbly played by David Ogden Stiers (Charles Emerson Winchester III from ""MASH"" among many other great performances) who is trying to understand his son and relate to him by being hip, Lane's stoner friend, Charles De Mar, well played by Charles Armstrong, the psychotic paperboy, ""I want my two dollars!,"" the Japanese drag racers who either speak no English or speak like Howard Cosell, Ricky the creepy neighbor, and Badger (Lane's brother) who never speaks but sends away for guides like ""How to Meet Trashy Women"" and ""How to Build a Space Shuttle out of Household Items"" and somehow makes them work.  These are only a few of the side characters

I enjoy this film and find it to be humorous, although with an 80's feel.  Elizabeth Daily is hilarious (while not intentionally) as the singer at the dance trying to do the rocker strut.  My two favorite scenes are when Lane imagines himself making a Frankenburger to the tune of Van Halen's ""Everybody Wants Some,"" and when Lane, after deciding not to jump of a bridge, is knocked off by De Mar.  Lane lands in a garbage truck where two city workers trimming trees observe, ""Man, now thats a real shame when folks be throwing away a perfectly good white boy like that.""

374694,4,6301802322,"It *may* be that the time for this film has passed.

I don't know.

I saw this movie for the first time the other day (honestly, I'd never even heard of it before that) and wondered how not even the cult-circles I travel in had picked up on it. So, I came here to read the reviews and write one of my own, as I invariably do, when I read another review complaining that this film isn't ""edgy,"" ""surreal,"" or ""cerebral"" enough. And, it occured to me--""you're not from the 80s, are you?""

That review was written by someone who grew up in the 90s. I just know it. The 80s teen comedy is... its own thing. It is a unique genre, and it saw life for only a few years. The 80s teen comedy didn't need to be particularly edgy, etc. Its strengths are that it is satiric without being cruel, whimsical without being fluffy and, almost above all else, sincere. And, I'm just not sure that the youth of today (""Generation Y"" *cough*) are in a position to appreciate it. I think that this might be one of the early signs that culture has moved on....

That said, let me actually review this film! :)

Better Off Dead is an archetypal 80s teen comedy. It has the pointlessly mean, girlfriend-stealing jock. The well-meaning, loser central character. The odd, but loyal, best friend (Revenge of the Nerds' Booger, no less!). The comic parents who just never understand. And, of course, it ends in the ""big challenge"" between the loser-hero and the jock (a ski race) with the stakes being the girl they've contended for.

Beyond that, it has an interestingly eccentric kind of comedy (like the Japanese street racers, who continually challenge our hero in the voice of Howard Cosell). It features sequences in animation, and some rudimentary special effects and, despite what our 90s born reviewer might think, is actually pretty advanced for its time.

Not all of the elements always work, but enough do to make this an interesting and charming comedy. It is also, certainly, a bit of an 80s time-capsule. I'm not certain that this movie can quite play the same way to the audiences of today; I think it possible that the tastes of today's youth are different, in the same way that the Baby Boomers do not seem to ""get"" Kevin Smith. However, for the children of the 80s, this is a cult-comedy that, if you manage to hear about it, is well worth watching.",1154908800,3,2340,4.530805687203792
374713,4,6301802322,"Better Off Dead is an unabashedly wacky, sometimes dark teen comedy which contains loony animated passages and other similarly implausible scenes. But thru all the juvenile sight gags and goofy plot contrivances, there is a standard romantic storyline cleaving to the film. Lane Myer (John Cusack) is a teenage loser who regularly undergoes excruciatingly embarrasing moments in high school. Losing his lovely girl Beth (Amanda Wyss) to Roy, the popular but arrogant school ski captain, seems par for the course. Everyone wants to go out with Beth, from the local mailman, to Lane's teacher, to even one of Lane's cartoon creations. Lane decides to kill himself in a series of hilarious not-to-be-taken-serious segments. Things kind of turn around for him when Monique, a sexy French exchange student, comes to stay with his weird neighbors. Lane, with Monique's help, tries to win Beth back by ski racing Roy down the daunting slopes of the K-12.

John Cusack is SO the man! There's just something about him. Two of my favorite teen movies of the '80s star Cusack (The Sure Thing and Say Anything). And, somehow, his charm and sympathetic average guy sensibilities hold this zany picture together. Diane Franklin (who?) is very winsome as the foreign exchange student Monique Junot. The movie's antagonists -  Roy Stalin and Ricky Smith - are despicable and annoying enough that the viewer feels a justified sense of euphoria when they, at last, meet their comeuppance.

This film has an energetic, almost manic, pulse. Some of the zany gags are realized thru Lane's wild imagination and daydreams. The rest, however, is warped director Savage Steve Holland asking us to take the lunacy in stride, and because of the good humor inherent in the film, we do. My preferred scenes of dippiness are the flashbacks of when Lane and Beth were together, all the moments with the beautiful and daring Monique, and whenever that murderous newspaper boy is persecuting Lane, all for the sake of ""two dollars.""

The film's outrageous tone is abetted by the cast of oddball characters. Lane's best friend Charles (Curtis Armstrong, aka Booger from the Revenge of the Nerds films), who snorts everything in sight, has been attending the same high school for 7 and a half years (but, hey, he's no dummy). Naturally, the grim, relentlessly single-minded newspaper boy who stalks Lane throughout the film is a full out riot. Then there's Lane's precocious younger brother, who likes to party with older women and tinker with science fiction gadgetry (seems like an innocent hobby til the kid zooms away in his own space shuttle). Other notables are the two Japanese teens who street race with Lane, one of whom doesn't speak a syllable of English, the other who perfectly mimics Howard Cosell.

I've seen Better Off Dead quite a few times, and I like and enjoy it now as much as I ever did. Yes, it's zany and maybe a tad surreal and very much over the top. But, largely because of John Cusack, it's got massive heart and charisma. Recommended for the young at heart.",1154736000,,3051,4.928015564202335

374721,5,6301802322,"Better Off Dead is one of my favorite 80's movies involving John Cusack. He plays Lane, who is obsessed with his girlfriend, Beth, and becoming part of the very esteemed ski team. But Lane's world is turned upside down during ski tryouts when the ski team captain steals his girl away and denies him a spot on the team. Lane keeps devising ways to kill himself that fortunately (and very comedically) never work out. Meanwhile, the dorky neighbor kid, Ricky & his overbearing mom take in a French foreign exchange student, Monique, and the mom uses this as an opportunity to try to bud a romance between the two. But Monique is anything but attracted to the hideous Ricky who won't keep his ""tentacles"" to himself. The only thing that saves Lane and Monique from the unpleasantness in their lives in the friendship the two soon form and the incredibly amusing moments that ensue in the midst of it.

This movie is filled with some very hilarious moments...the Japanese guys who always try to race Lane on the streets (one of them learned to speak English by imitating Howard Cosell, sorry if I spelled that incorrectly), Lane's mom's cooking, Pig Burger and the unforgettable claymation burger singing Van Halen's ""Everybody Wants Some,"" and the dinner scene with Lane's family and Ricky's family are just a few of them.

374741,4,6301802322,"Better Off Dead has been described as a black comedy, because of the main character's attempts to committ suicide.  But the movie is just a comedy, and a great one at that.

The story is about high school student Laine, whose girlfriend Beth is his entire life.  When she dumps him for Roy Stalin, the Ken doll handsome captain of the ski team, he decides he would like to end it all.  But his periodic attempts are thwarted in funny ways.  Attempting to move on, his misery sometimes takes a surreal twist, such as when his drawings become animated and speak to him, and when he creates Frankenburger and bride of Frankenburger at his new fast food job.  His crazy friend Charles (who looks old enough to be in college) tries to motivate him to challenge Roy to the infamous ski course called K-12.

When this movie came out, I loved it, and when I saw it again after ten years or so, I hated it, recognizing too many of the jokes as too broad and silly. But, after this viewing, I can say that I've made my peace with this film. It's not the amazing end-of-all comedies that I remembered from my youth, but it is both clever and evocative, and didn't deserve the mental drubbing I've been giving it for the last two years or so.

  The movie does a terrific job of melding the surreal experience without compromising the feeling of reality that permeates Lane's life. Almost everything is ridiculously over the top, from a dinner that slides itself off the plate to a couple of asian drag racers, one of whom learned English from watching ESPN and therefore talks like Howard Cosell. Nevertheless, we sympathize with Lane, and really feel his pain when he is the target of derision from his ex-girlfriend, and the high school bullies who make his life miserable.

There was nothing shocking or vulgar about films like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Better Off Dead"". There is such an innocence to the films that is sorely lacking in today's brand of teen comedies. ""Better Off Dead"" is one of the funniest movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching as a teenager. John Cusack plays Lane Myer who ends up getting dumped by his highschool sweetheart Beth for the captain of the ski team. After getting dumped, Lane becomes suicidal and attempts to off himself but every time he tries to he fails. His family is totally oblivious to Lane's attempts at suicide. The mother is the funniest member of Lane's family as she cooks up such horrible food. His father is totally oblivious. And Lane's brother is too busy building rockets. If she wasn't hilarious enough, there is Lane's best friend who will just about snort up anything from jello to snow through a straw. Eventually Lane meets the French foreign exchange student who is living with this fat nerd and his obsessive mother. With her help, Lane comes out of his deep funk. One of my personal favorite moments in the film is when Lane daydreams at his job that the fast food he cooks comes to life. I also loved it when Lane sticks q-tips in every orifice on his face. And who can forget about the psychotic paper boy who chases after Lane throughout the entire movie? The characters in this film are all hysterically funny and unforgettable.

It's about beating some Korean kids off the line (one who speaks Howard Cosel while the other speaks no English at all) without having you dental plan activated. I make no attempt to try and convince you that this is a great movie. It is what it is. I will however give you this bit of advice, look for the little things.

See Charles mouthing to his fetal pig (or whatever it is) in the jar to ""WAKE UP!"" as the camera pans by. Sure it has great lines. Sure it has funny moments.

No matter how many times I watch it, this movie just won't stop being funny.  It's a dead-on examination of high-school alienation and suburban depression, with a twisted sense of humor that separated it from overrated (in my opinion) '80's movies like ""Risky Business"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""
In the role he was seemingly born to play, John Cusack performs the lead role of Lane Myer, a high school student driven to the brink of suicide after the girlfriend he's obsessed with dumps him for the more popular ski team captain.  Lane is essentially a human punching bag, with little indignities and embarassments piling up on him until his life becomes intolerable.  He has a weird passive-aggressive quality about him, suffering mainly in silence even as his frustrations mount and he tries to figure out a way to improve his lot.  To some viewers, Lane might seem like a baby who exaggerates his problems, but anyone with fresh memories of suffering through high school knows better.  Lane is such a relatable and enduring character precisely because during your teen years everything often seems like a matter of life and death.
What really makes the movie, though, is the collection of screwball characters and director Savage Steve Holland's keen eye for inspired details.  ""Better Off Dead"" is filled with little bizarre elements that may not have much of anything to do with the plot, but they'll make you laugh.  Lane's little brother builds elaborate futuristic contraptions and studies (with great success) the art of picking up trashy women.  Lane's math class sits in rapt attention as their teacher explains a geometry problem.  An evil paperboy torments Lane for two dollars.  A cheerleader dates the entire basketball team.  Lane's weirdo mother serves a variety of ""French"" foods for a visiting French exchange student.  Every few minutes the film digresses for one of Lane's fantasy sequences, giving the plot a stream-of-consciousness quality that was way ahead of its time in mainstream cinema.
Eventually Lane finds love and takes on his skiing rival in the movie's hilarious finale, but that's not really important.  What matters is what happens getting there.  I've seen few movies as creative or intelligent as this one, regardless of what decade they came out of.  If you haven't seen it yet, what's wrong with you?",1056153600,3,2496,4.990338164251208

Plot: various social misfits vie for respect with the cool kids, finding self-respect, and love, on the way. (Never seen THAT flick before, huh?)
My two cents: I've gotta give writer/director Holland credit for inventiveness and guts: he puts it all out there. But... he puts it ALL out there, and for every bit that really works, there's one that really doesn't. David Odgen Stiers as the concerned dad is appealing; Kim Darby as the over-the-top mom is appalling. The foreign-exchange student routine works well enough; the drug-challenged best friend doesn't.

This is a movie with a story we've seen millions of times, but spiced up with plenty of creative sketches that, while they never add anything to the story, they sure make it a lot of fun! Cusack plays Lane, a teenager whose girlfriend has just broken up with him and he feels suicide is the only way out. Meanwhile, across the street a new foreign exchange student has moved in and is being pestered by the nerdy boy of the house. She soon takes an affection to Lane, even though she's never met him. Already, you can make assumptions on how they meet, how much English she really speaks, whether or not Lane will choose her over his ex, Beth, whether Lane will finally defeat the jock whom Beth has hooked up with. It all sounds so predictable. And for the most part it is. But there are so many other factors that make this movie great. Lane's best friend tries to get high on snow and jello; Lane's geography teacher is incredibly boring, but the students are strangely energized in the class; Lane gets a job at a local fast food place and creates a clay-animated living cheeseburger! There's tons more added to the mayhem. The movie may be easy to predict, but it sure has a lot of weird and funny stuff going on. I'd recommend it to those high-schoolers who think life just can't get any worse. In all likelihood, this will cheer you up.",1052524800,2,1480,4.464944649446495

Savage Steve Holland's direction is fantastic, as was his direction in another Cusack film, ""One Crazy Summer"" (equally worthy of your hard-earned...or not so hard-earned...money).  But Cusack...there's a reason Cusack is one of my absolutely favorite actors, and this is one of them.
Who has not been in this situation?  Who has not pined for someone who wants absolutely nothing to do with you and is only after aesthetics?  This film DEFINES the high-school experience, certainly as it existed when I was in high-school (i.e., around the time of this movie).  It is filled with humor, sorrow, the total absurd (i.e., Cusack's mother and her creative ""meals""), etc.  It definitely belongs in the same class as the John Hughes films (Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles...which has another Cusack cameo, Breakfast Club, etc.) as well as the much-loved Cameron Crowe written ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""
Definitely get this film and laugh and cry all over again.  It will give you the warm fuzzies as you recall the times of the era of the film, but also make you wonder how the heck you survived such times.

I finally purchased my DVD and was a little dissappointed in the lack of special features! Um, let me correct that--there are no special features. Not even a trailer.

  This movie is simply wonderful:  hilarious, poignant, sardonic, and romantic, it features what defined 80s adolescent flicks -- John Cusack.  Who could play the everyman better than he?  Who was more skilled at identifying with a teenage audience than Mr. Cusack?  As a 17-year-old, I can say that the film has not lost any of its charm:  this is a cult flick at my school, and it still resonates.
  If you're a girl, you want to be with Lane Meyer (Cusack's character).  If you're a guy, you simply want to BE him.  'Nuff said.
  The film relies not on gross-out humour (thank God), but on subtle touches of wit, elements of fantasy (Lane's crawling meal), and absolutely hilarious comic vignettes (""How To Pick Up Trashy Women"")
  In short:  it's worth buying, and has not dated in the least.  Much like Say Anything..., it was another critical triumph for Cusack, but a bomb at the box office.  Why are such good films appreciated AFTER they've played out in theaters!!?  There's no justice...

He teaches us the very important, if overly stressed message in movies of this genre (enter The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles), that love can be found in the most unexpected places, and only when you're not actively seeking it out.

374929,5,6301802322,"As the years go by, I find myself growing more and more convinced that the '80s were the last true golden age for that often-maligned genre, the teen sex comedy.  Whereas now Hollywood shells out a small fortune to finance a Britney Spears soundtrack for films starring young men who make Frankie Avalon look complex (and featuring actresses who seem to have copied Annette Funnicello's bust but none of her own admitedly simple charm), the '80s were usually made with low budgets, up-and-coming young actors who at least seemed to be having fun, scripts that were too joyfully crude to ever be considered truly offensive, and directors who seem to have vanished at the decade's in.  My own personal favorite amongst these directors was ""Savage"" Steve Holland (Is that a perfect '80s name or what?) who defined the entire decade with just two films -- One Crazy Summer and especially Better Off Dead.  Both of these films display Holland's crazed, gloriously strange wit, his penchant for casting Curtis Armstrong as a high school students (despite the fact that Armstrong appeared to be in his 30s at the time), his fondness for the random nonsensical cartoon, and especially his early foresight to make John Cusack his favored star.
In Better Off Dead, Cusack plays a likeable but nerdy high school schlub.  Of course, all teen films claim to be about likeable schlubs but Cusack was one of the few actors who was actually believable as being both likeable and socially unpopular.  He's dumped by his girlfriend, decides to beat her new boyfriend in a ski competition, attempts suicide a few times -- in a bit that everyone seems to hold as their personal favorite -- has to deal with a homicidal paper boy who wants his two dollars.  Its a crazed plot and Holland doesn't waste much time trying to make it all coherent.  Instead, he uses the plot as an excuse to pile on more and more strange sight gags and bizarre characters.  In short, rather than pretending his story is some sort of grand artistic statement (like the current crop of youth films), Holland creates his own demented world -- a world where high school students are sent into almost religious ecstacy when their math teacer assigns them 200 pages of homework (their sincerely joyful reaction is my own personal favorite of the film's many out-there moments) and even a cartoon comes to life and asks permission to date Cusack's ex.  Its a world where one of my favorite, unjustly unknown actresses of that era -- the sweetly pretty Diana Franklin -- shows up as a French exchange student who offers Cusack a chance at true romance if only he can survive a ""fencing"" match with an even more nerdy suitor.  Its a world where a Japanese exchange student does a perfect imitation of Howard Cosell.  In short, its a world that could only have been created in the freedom-loving days of the 1980s and John Cusack becomes the perfect everyman to lead us through that world.  There are so many hilarious lines in Better off Dead and it seems everyone has their own personal favorite (""Its a shame people be throwing out a perfectly good white boy like that"" comes up a lot though Armstrong shouting ""Can you imagine the street value of this"" as he snorts up a line of white snow is my own choice).  What is truly amazing is that for a film that was dismissed when it originally opened, Better off Dead seems to have become the personal ""cult"" film of just about everyone who went to high school during the 1980s.
Cusack is one of the best actors working today but, for many of his long-time fans, his recent work has been a bit disappointing.  Since renouncing the whole teen film thing, some of Cusack's performances have -- on occasion -- seemed to be a case of an actor taking himself too seriously.  Even if the films did little for his career, Cusack seemed to, at least, be having fun in films like Better off Dead -- a quality that sometimes appears to missing from his ""mature"" work.  Of course, everyone in Better Off Dead seems to be having fun.  Its a fun, genuinely goon natured film and this is why -- despite being dismissed by snobs over the years -- it retains such a strong following.  Whenever I see a commercial for yet another film featuring Freddie Prinze, Jr. doing his ""soulful"" thing while the Backstreet Boys parade in the background, I think of Better Off Dead and its missing director.  Come back, Savage Steve and -- whatever you have to do -- bring John Cusack with you.  We all deserve to have a little fun again.",1009152000,147,4506,4.644025157232704

And, compared to Cusack's other work, I was a little disappointed. His Everyman charm didn't quite shine the way I'm used to. That being said, there were scenes in this movie that were truly classic. I particularly enjoyed the bits of animation and the scene in Geometry class. The boy who portrayed Cusack's little brother was also a gem (he's an 8 year old genius who routinely orders books like ""How to pick up easy women"" and ""How to make a space shuttle"" and then actually does them).

There are several great characters: the paperboy, the neighbor, Little Ricky, Monique, the paperboy, the teacher, the owner of ""Pig Burgers"", the Japanese race-car drivers, Roy, and finally: the paperboy. This is the only movie that I've ever seen that was so good and so funny, I actually re-wound it at the end and watched it a second time the first time I rented it. There are several great running gags like Lane's brother building a spaceship (out of household appliances) and the ways Lane keeps trying to commit suicide. Ricky and his Mother steal the show though. This is what a great comedy is supposed to be. Kudos to all involved. It doesn't get any better than this.

And those are just some of the odd situations populating this movie.
""High Fidelity"" (and Cusack's Golden Globe nomination for it) helped John Cusack keep his hammerlock on the title ""King of The Break-Up Film"" (awarded during an unofficial poll at the Internet Movie Database back in 1999), but this film helped him earn the title in the first place.
Written and directed by animator Savage Steve Holland, it's one of the more insane-yet-enjoyable teen angst films of the '80s.  Think of it like something John Hughes would have made if he'd spent a *lot* more time partying in college.",982108800,,998,4.724137931034483

Also it's a very 80's movie (which is not a compliment).  And I found about 90% of the characters annoying and unreal.  Okay I'm being harsh.  Afterall it can't be that horrible if I've seen it several times and I have given it 3 whole stars.

It  about a teen, played by John Cusack who loses his girlfriend to a skier. He  trys to win her back by becoming a skier but it all falls through.
I  forget the guys name, but the guy who played ""Booger"" in the  ""Nerd"" series, was in this film and he was just as funny...One  word Snow!
One of the flaws I saw in this movie was between John Cusack  and the Forign Exange Student's romance together. There was no build up to  it. However they did make up for lost time.
This is probably one of  Cusacks best films. I personaly liked it better than ""Being John  Malkovich"", being that it had a good plot, then it went down. But  these are completly different films so I guess I should not really say  anything.
So if this flim ever comes out on DVD, I will most definatly  get it. An over-all good choice. Those paper-boy scenes were great!

(Sorry, exhausting long  sentence!) But this movie truly has memorable line after memorable line  that seem to keep recycling themselves at offices around the country by  Generation X-ers who loved John Cusack in his early years.
This movie  tickles the viewer as it takes you through Lane's up-and-down last year of  high school and transforms him from a can't-do loser into a capable winner.

Strangeness abounds, and is presented as reality, from the manic paperboy  to the sleezbo mailman to the spudboy next door to the aardvark costumes  (!) -- this is where we had to stop the tape until we felt we could sober  up and take it without confusion -- to the psychotic little brother from  another planet. Just a wonderful fulfillment of the creator's twisted  vision of teen romance and high school hijinks (no movie  made by a  standard Hollywood committee of moneymen ever had so many deft personal  touches).  Dense, rich, full of wonderful lines (""You know times are  bad when someone be throwing away a perfectly good white boy.""),  Better Off Dead stays funny and won't collect dust on your shelf.",967507200,,1121,4.8052631578947365
374982,3,6301802322,"John Cusack has always played the underdog in his teenager days. He also had to work the hardest for the girls to look at him and not pass him over  for the buff blonde jock dude.
Whether it was One Crazy Summer, Say  Anything or Better Off Dead. Even in movies where he has the girl, like Hot  Pursuit, he doesn't have it easy.
Better Off Dead represent's Lane  ""Oscar"" Meyer's nightmare.  He has just lost his girlfriend,  doesn't make it on the Ski Team, has the boss from hell and even his 9 year  old brother is picking up trashy women, while he can't get any.  Oh yeah,  there's a psychotic paperboy after him for $2. The movie is about him  trying to win back the love of his woman, while not seeing the love that is  shown right in front of his face in the form of a perky French Exchange  Student.
Of course, this isn't a ""real"" High School Movie, but  an allegory of what High School Students feel they go through.  It's like a  yearbook that has come to life.  On that level, it works very well.  I  always crack up when I see those wacky scenes like Lane being constantly  challenged by the Japanese version of Howard Cosell, or finding interesting  new ways to commit suicide.  It hits a little closer to home because when  the movie came out in 1985, I was in the throws of HS society and it had  more of an impact that it would to younger kids today (who may see Clueless  as a more relevant film).
Cusack (like all his other movies) plays the  straight (if  slightly bewildered) male lead and we feel sorry for what he  goes through.  Whether it is dueling Ricky Smith for the love of the  exchange student or being creamed by the ENTIRE senior basketball Team, we  all tend to feel for him because he always seems to get the short end of  the stick.  His sidekick, Charles (Curtis Armstrong playing the same way he  did with his character Booger from Revenge of the Nerds), fills in the  moments when Lane becomes a little too serious.
However, the movie is so  unserious that it is hard to really get any deeper feeling off the movie.  It is sort of like that guy (or gal) in high school that knew and was  social with everyone, but no one remembers 10 years later because he/she  never tried anything other than surface social friendship with  anyone.
Better Off Dead is not a smart comedy like Real Genius, or one  with a message, but it is fun to watch John Cusack for 2 hours play a  person like we used to be, get the girl and become the hero of his little  world.....Rating: C+",966384000,,2501,4.278969957081545
374983,4,6301802322,"Better Off Dead almost perfectly captures the futility (and humor) of high  school life.  The plot revolves around Lane, a kid who tries very hard to  fit in at school in order to impress his ex-girlfriend Beth.  This movie  has a hilairious cast of characters ranging from Lane's mom who cooks  things that literally crawl off the plate, to the geeky, crocheting,  nasal-spray snorting Ricky.  The problems that Lane has are funny, and  being a high school student myself, I can say that this movie has a lot of  truth to it.  However entertaining this movie is, there are several scenes  which I felt could have easily been cut from the movie without disrupting  the plot. They almost seemed to be the writer or director's in-jokes. The  soundtrack is almost unbearable; it sounds like it was recorded on a  child's toy keyboard. However, the innumerable funny scenes, and  unforgettable characters compensate for all of that.",965952000,,928,4.890322580645162

374985,4,6301802322,"Director ""Savage"" Steve Holland does a masterful job of showing how HS aged teens perceive the world around them.  And a young John Cusack does a great job as the inwardly tortured teen with the twisted view of  reality (funny, but twisted).  It is, after all, our perception of reality  that is, for us, reality.
John Cusack plays a HS teen obsessed (and I  mean OBSESSED!) with his girlfriend.  When she dumps him for the captain of  the HS ski team it's amazing what happens to and around him.
This movie  includes laugh out loud scenes.  You'll love his nemesis on the street  racing scene, his neighbor ""Ricky,"" and the French foreign  exchange student who sees Cusack when he can't see anything else.
Watch  for lines that will live forever, like... ""Oh, please, don't let it be  a bugger."" ""Gee Ricky, I'm sorry your mom blew up.""  ""Language lessons."" ""You know...friend."" and ""I  want my two dollars!""
There are, however, students at the HS dance  who cannot possibly still be of HS age -- but that's typical for the  movies...people want to remember themselves as being older, more mature  than any HS students are anywhere -- talk about twisted views of reality!
Anyway, this is a grand movie with lots of wonderful lines, a fun story  line, some interesting side trips into Cusack's daydreams, and an ongoing  feud between Cusack's dad and the paperboy.
Check it out, it's a 4 star  movie with 5 star hilarity.

John Cusack,  as we all know, rocks.  He rocks on in this movie, like in all his other  ones I've ever seen.  For me, I think the thing that worked best about this  movie is the sheer concatenation of random, bizarre subplots.  The  homicidal newspaper boy who wants his 2 dollars; the Japanese brothers who  learned to speak English by watching Howard Cosell; Lane's mutant pal,  played by the actor who played ""Booger"" in ""Revenge of the  Nerds""; Lane's effortlessly brilliant little brother, who gets  everything he wants while Lane's life goes to hell; Lane's monumentally  un-hip father, who wants to be cool; and the disgusting fat kid who has the  hots for his french exchange student;  sue me, but it all works.
It is  also a movie that doesn't really take itself too seriously.  The basic  story of identifying true love is a good one, but basically, it's all just  constantly hilarious.  Oh, the trials and tribulations of suburbia.  Definitely a must-see.",961459200,20,1242,4.705607476635514
374988,5,6301802322,"John Cusack once again shows the struggle for peer acceptance in this funny 80s comedy. Cusack gives a great performance at what he knows best, being a teenager. For Lane Myer, being a teenager is the most surreal and  diverse experience one can go through. His life is full of things that you  wouldn't normally find: a ditsy mother who likes to experiment with all  types of food (from boiling bacon to cooking something that looks like an  octopus), a father who reads 70s slang manuals to try to relate to Lane,  and a younger brother who has a better time scoring chicks than Lane. Even  school is surreal for him. I mean, who is actually happy to be at school?  The movie also brings in some interesting twists, like drawings that talk  back to Lane, and fun sequence featuring an Eddie Van Halen hamburger  playing guitar. The film comes up with one of my favorite lines of all  time: When Lane is pushed off a bridge and into a garbage truck, he passes  two black tree trimmers and one of them says ""Now that's a shame when  folks throw away a perfectly good white boy like that"". What I'm  trying to get at is, Lane looks at adolesence as we all did at one time or  another, as a very twilight zone-ish experience. We all tried to win  admiration and respect from peers, and then when we struck out, we would  see things as Lane did.
