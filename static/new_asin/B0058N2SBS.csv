4600069,5,B0058N2SBS,"For those who didn't think it was exciting enough, leave the ""evil general"" clich edge-of-the-seat excitement to the other superficial movies - I'm glad Contagion was above that.

The intelligent unfolding of the realities of human nature in what would really happen if a deadly epidemic spread through the population was scary and thought provoking enough.  There wasn't one scene in the movie that I couldn't imagine happening if this were real.

It was interesting, well written, great cast and acting, and perfectly told the story.",1315699200,62,535,5.1976744186046515
4600070,5,B0058N2SBS,"Excellent movie! Makes you really think about how one thing can lead to something horrible! One touch, one cough, one bump, one hand shake, one movement....Watch out! Good movie though....Gwen Paltrow acts her tail off too! Lmao DON'T LET ANYONE TOUCH YOU ANYMORE....AND WATCH OUT FOR PORK! OINK OINK....",1315612800,,304,5.224489795918367
4600071,1,B0058N2SBS,"I saw this movie tonight, and at first it seemed okay but then it got real boring, it is badly written and poorly acted out, there was no excitement or suspense in this movie, it is just pure bland...I'm not going to say anymore then that, but there are better older movies out there like The Cassandra Crossing.  This is just my opinion, you on the other hand might like contagion, to me it was a total waste of 2 hours. This movie is more suited towards a made for television kind of film, thank you!",1315526400,4,502,4.229166666666667

Which version is it?

4600080,5,B0058N2SBS,This was so well-written...that I thought it came from a book. I actually searched for the book for a while before I discovered that it was an original screenplay.  I had seen this for free on my cable...but rented it because I wanted to see the uncut version. ... & to watch it all the way through rather than in snippets. well worth the expense of renting.  highly entertaining.,1522886400,,380,4.492753623188406

4600087,3,B0058N2SBS,"almost a four-star, not quite. It's really a good enuff movie despite the predictability of this type of plot/genre. The stars did great acting.
Except for that Jude Law character.
I did not appreciate the heavy U.N. aspect. But that's what you have to expect out of Hollywierd Left-Coasties: globalization and ""U.N.-is-the-Hero shtick. Other than that international flair to it, was a good enuff flick.",1519430400,,403,5.2153846153846155
4600088,5,B0058N2SBS,"The filmmaker actually met with people from the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization and asked them, ""What is your biggest fear?"" This movie is a portrayal of what they are preparing for, but dreading. WAY smarter than any other disease movie you've seen. The filmmaker really gets into all the different players and all the different issues  how to handle Internet charlatans? What would it be like to be quarantined with your family for a year? What are the challenges of disseminating a vaccine once it is discovered  who gets to live, first? But here's the thing, it's also fascinating to watch. So many small stories that tell you something about humans. Spoiler alert: although the movie has nothing to do with politics, the movie can't help but show how our civil servants do important stuff, and that we should give them adequate funding, and that many of them risk their lives to keep our society humming along. We should give them a little respect.",1519344000,8,983,4.810650887573964

4600096,5,B0058N2SBS,"What kind of throws you off is how UNdramatic it is compared to the Zombie movies, But the realistic chill seeps in when you see just how easy it is to spread the disease. None of the actors over acted which really contributed to the horror of just how bad a contagion could be. I love Matt Damon as a father! What really got to me was the end. (and I won't be a spoiler!)",1509494400,2,372,3.973333333333333
4600097,3,B0058N2SBS,"Mild drama wrapped in racism & patriotism.  If ""World almost destroyed because Chinese people are filthy and their government is corrupt, but America saves the day somehow"" doesn't sound appealing, probably not for you.  Maybe the intent was to send a message to encourage people to wash their hands?  Aside from that, it's decent as far as a drama film goes...  The intro was compelling.  A little unclear on the science behind how bat saliva mixed with pig saliva creates a bat-pig virus that annihilates mankind, but ok.",1508630400,2,523,4.8977272727272725
4600098,4,B0058N2SBS,Definitely gives me the heebie-jeebies. Interesting look at how society would respond to a large scale viral threat.,1506902400,3,116,5.5

4600103,2,B0058N2SBS,"Most movies get 3 stars from me even if they aren't that good, because there is usuallly some element of it that I can appreciate for entertainment value. Sadly, this is not one of those for me. For a ""virus"" type of movie, ""Outbreak"" is a much better choice. I've seen this movie about 3 times now, and it's only because I forget that I've seen it until it's too late, so I've given it chances. It's full of great actors who do great jobs for the most part. However, it doesn't matter to me when the movie is boring, and this one is. Others might like this drama, but for me there was no suspense and no feeling of peril to it. I can't recommend this for anyone unless you like slow movies. Guide=some strong language, no nudity and a few gross scenes of sick people.",1504396800,,768,4.2312925170068025
4600104,4,B0058N2SBS,"I saw this movie back in 2012 and have been itching to see it for the last couple of weeks for some dramatic insight on the whole Ebola issue going on in Africa that has recently poked it's way into the United States. Overall, It was a pretty good movie and a great choice of cast. Although at times it seemed like everyone was chillin' and not freaking about about this deadly disease but rather sitting in meeting being rude to one another, Weird but Good.",1504224000,,458,4.337209302325581

4600108,5,B0058N2SBS,"The film is simply put, as many have said: terrifyingly realistic. Yes, the film makes you a bit paranoid afterwards, but I'll talk more about the filmmaking. Soderbergh's desire to make a truly gripping yet realistic film about how a pandemic could spread is what makes this film great. It's an example how other films should be made as well. There is no drama better than pure reality, and the truth is often stranger than fiction. Soderbergh truly is a master of drama and he tied it all in so well on both a global and personal level. I think it would've been interesting if the film addressed how other nations (probably) were also developing vaccines for the virus, but that's only a side note and doesn't really affect the movie as a whole.",1501372800,3,747,4.582089552238806
4600109,5,B0058N2SBS,"This movie was recommended to me by several scientists and it has changed how I think about disease outbreak.  ""Nothing spreads faster than fear"" is the sub-title and very true.  Highly recommended.",1501200000,,198,5.15625

4600112,5,B0058N2SBS,"I really enjoyed this movie. All the actors were great, Matt Damon was a bit lack luster considering the parts he normally plays but it worked. I would've liked a more intense character the way Brad Pitt was in World War Z or Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds. He was just too blah. But in any case, I love these kinds of movies about viruses that can kill off the world. This wasn't as good as Virus which is a must-see (Dustin Hoffman). I did feel that this movie kept up the excitement and intensity through-out. I definitely think it's worth seeing. A good cast and well-paced.",1500336000,,579,4.321100917431193

4600204,4,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion
 This is a movie worth our time.  It stimulates our interest in a number of ways, first among them being the ensemble cast and episodic nature of the narrative.  From the title, you have guessed that the subject is a new and horrible plague.  The story is told as the horror impacts particular people, hence the episodic telling of the tale.
 We could not ask for a finer cast of players.  Matt Damon plays the husband to Gwyneth Paltrow, the central hub of infection.  An interesting part of the story is just how medical scientists track an outbreak to its origin.  This is part of the effort to isolate, identify and combat the fast moving contagion.  Laurence Fishburne has the role of senior scientist in charge of the investigation.  Kate Winslet is the brave field investigator.  Jude Law slowly reveals the character of an investigative journalist who sells out humanity (and his own humanity) by peddling nostrums to a desperate public.  It struck me as believable and horrifying at the same time.  Elliott Gould has a small but important role.  Most of the principal characters display varying sorts of character flaws, or at least imperfections, which, with these actors, makes the movie that much more enjoyable.
 The pacing of the film for me occupies the place of most importance.  The contagion begins slowly, first only a few patients are found.  The plague is relentless and unstoppable, growing in strength and speed of spread with chilling certainty.  It is, in its way, a very scary movie.
 Director/Producer Steven Soderbergh has given us a score of films over the years, including the major blockbusters Erin Brockovich, the terrific Traffic (also done in small episodes and also very fine) and the three films Oceans Eleven, Oceans Twelve and Oceans Thirteen.  If Contagion does not quite measure up to the brilliance of Traffic it is still a gripping and entertaining film.  It is better paced and better acted, in the whole, than the similar Outbreak of a few years back.  The three and a half saw blade film is rated a tame PG-13 and that only for the theme of mass death.
 Some might find fault with the unlikely (or scientifically impossible if you like) resolution of the mystery of the origin of the plague, but not I.  In a film that is part Sci-Fi, part disaster film and part medical mystery you expect a stretch here and there.
 The producers made the film on a $60 million budget.  They may have trouble getting their money back.  The take over the first three day made a substantial but not remarkable pile of money amounting to $23 million.  I think the fine acting and thrilling pace of the film will bring in the audience.",1470268800,,2671,4.747826086956522

4600207,4,B0058N2SBS,"I admit I skipped this movie when it was in theaters. Don't really have a good reason, but it just didn't catch my attention. Probably preoccupied with Captain America, Sherlock Holmes and Rango. Not sorry that I didn't pay full price for it, but it is a pretty good movie.

So for less than $5 used on Amazon I was willing to give it a shot. It's really very good. I was a big fan of the movie Outbreak in 1995 and this one does a credible job as a techno-thriller. It's kind of a Crichton novel type of movie with lots of believable characters, good dialogue and realistic science. Mostly realistic science. Probably the weakest point (and I hate to say this) is Mark Wahlberg's character. Not bad but just comes across like a cow in a twister movie. I love his other work so it's not him, just the way the character was written.

Overall I like it and have watched it 3 or 4 times. I can see pulling this one down every year or so to watch again. Well worth my money.",1468886400,,970,4.209677419354839

The actors are truly believable, as is the story.  It is entirely possible for a virus to spread and to spread with the quickness depicted.  My favorite part of the movie is seeing how each of the smallest actions serve as a viral transmission and how unaware people are of the actions they take.
I appreciate the view of the government agencies and how much more difficult it is to deal with situations than any of us could ever know.  I also appreciate the view of the media.  It is interesting how easily people will believe what they read on a blog or see on TV.

Perhaps the best depiction is that of the population - the people.  The reactions of the multitudes is very real and very scary.  People fight over food and medications.  There is a lack of unity and a general fear for your own safety.  I could feel the tenseness as the people waited in line for a food ration.  It is madness the ideas of what people, ordinary people, can and most likely will become if this sort of thing ever happens.  Truly, I believe that at some point it will.

The event in this film are all plausible -- which makes it scarier than almost any horror movie.  How many horror movies have over 27 Million dead?

And it's important to realize that the virus presented in this film is not as bad as the actual Flu virus of 1918.

I had my kids watch this instead of watching a documentary on the Influenza of 1918 with great success.  Because it depicts an outbreak now, it connects with a modern audience better than history.

But as always, the scene-stealer is Jude Law. Almost every movie he's in, even the bad ones, it feels like he's operating on a level of acting many notches above his co-stars. Or maybe it's just his riveting screen presence. Now that he's older and has downgraded from dazzlingly beautiful to just drop-dead handsome--his looks no longer get in the way of his acting chops. Here he is with a huge A-list ensemble cast of the best movie actors around, and he is the most memorable character in the film. Every time he is on screen as the opportunistic blogger--the movie seems to wake up a little. Not that it's a sleepy movie, exactly, but when you have lots of people sick and dying everywhere, his cynical, darkly funny performance is a bracing tonic. Best scene in the movie: Jude on a TV talk show going head to head with Laurence Fishburne's CDC guy. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Most ""virus"" films don't feel that realistic to me. But this one--showing how a virus spreads through the most mundane, everyday contact--really scary. Matt Damon sleepwalks through this film--he is just such a bland actor.

Is there any need to tell what it's about?

We all know the importance of cleanliness but this film demonstrates the tenacity of a virus. I felt the urgency and frustration of the doctors and the fear and quick death of the infected. But as usual, there had to be a happy part...I didn't care for Damon's role as he lost his wife and stepson and then goes into protective mode with his daughter.

4600386,1,B0058N2SBS,"Of course, it came from primates. This is easy to believe because that is supposedly where HIV spawned from. Just two big, ugly problems with that theory: 1) the original polio vaccine was known to be laced with multiple monkey viruses before it was released to an uninformed public (read ""Dr. Mary's Monkey"" by Edward Haslam) and 2) African hunters had been killing and harvesting green monkeys for CENTURIES. But all of a sudden monkey viruses jumping to humans became oh-so-believable with crap films like Contagion and Outbreak.

This film out-did Outbreak on the Hollywood Fear-porn Scale by a good margin. However, when an audience is expected to care about a Matt Damon's daughter dating some teen, or Gwyneth Paltrow whoring-it-up in Asia and spreading the dreaded disease that we're all supposed to be soooo afraid of, my reaction was, ""Really?"" These were unlikable, cardboard-thin characters despite the children they were protecting or the job they were doing. Now on to the big-time CDC doctor numero uno, played by a bloated, miserable looking Larry Fishburne. His character expected a CDC janitor to keep a lid on the outbreak intel he overheard, was a complete d-bag to poor guy, but in the end, when Larry administers his antidote to janitor's kid, we're supposed to feel all warm and tingly. Or maybe we weren't, because it was directed and scripted about as blandly as Gwyneth's death scene, which was about as jarring to the viewer as an on-screen belch.

Hollywood will have to try harder or pull different rabbits out of new hats before I am genuinely drawn in by the next big fear-mongering disease outbreak flick, which they seem overly fond of releasing every couple years for the vaccination vendors.",1428883200,,1726,4.968858131487889
4600387,3,B0058N2SBS,"A film about the extinction of the human race due to a world wide pandemic. A story that will probably come true some day but here it's a little short on tension and suspense as the Director tries to get as many of his big stars in scenes. It ends up coming out as a big star movie about the end of the world that ends up being a little boring. No real suspense as the big stars slowly end up dying from the  Pandemic, along with the rest of the world. With the budget they must have had, this could have been a big box office money maker. Instead, it becomes just the opposite.  Lawrence Fishburne is the main character here and he does his best as a doctor trying to save mankind. Unfortionately, we all know ahead of time that he will fail and mankind will simply cease to exist. Great cinematography and a big star cast remind me of an Irwin Allen disaster film. Which isn't all bad, but it just doesn't have the ""Poseidon Adventure"" action, but more ""When The World Ended"". Buy it reasonably cheap and you'll probably like it.",1428883200,,1031,4.282051282051282

You aren't going to find high speed chases, or massive explosions in Contagion. What you are going to find is a masterfully told and highly realistic story about the spread of a disease. Personally, I was fascinated -- all the actors did a phenomenal job pulling us into their own individual stories. I loved the ending! Not only did it make sense, it was a great way to leave the audience with a sense of closure.

4600395,1,B0058N2SBS,"I usually do not watch movies that focus on outbreaks of disease - but I have seen my fair share of them and feel confident about being able to discern a good one from a bad.  First, there were some good things about the film I would like to mention.  The sound was well mixed and mastered, and the music, although uninspiring, had a catchy hook that helped to keep the film interesting because it seemed to indicated a level of tension that one would expect to eventually build into a significant plot development.  Instead, however, the film plodded through with flu-like malaise that you are glad is gone after having run its course.  The acting from Damon and Paltrow was good, but their characters were only given limited opportunities to perform, which made for an understated tone throughout.  Sadly, the plot never develops - it just runs its course, as a kind of metaphor for how diseases behave, but beyond this metaphor there was little entertainment value to speak of.  There was not really anything very significant or memorable about this movie at all, and there was some preposterous CGI at the end - if you watch closely - that just further unravels any attempt this film made toward realism.  I'm sorry, but you should probably steer clear of this one.",1427587200,3,1269,4.6891891891891895

Contagion is a fascinating, slow-paced film that explores, as you might expect, the spread of a lethal virus from its nascent stages of incubation all the way through global pandemic, and the efforts to detect and defeat the disease. What I think is interesting about this film is that it doesnt take a cartoonish ""World War Z"" approach (of course, we're talking two different genres) but rather offers a dramatic, personal, real-world storyline with a bit of adventure thrown in.

The acting is top notch (Cotillard, Damon, etc.), the story compelling, and, if you are OK with a slow-paced film covering a subject that is most often approached with an action hero or other dynamic response, then I think you'll find this one worth a rental.",1424995200,2,758,4.9140625

I love smart suspense/thrillers, and I feel like this was right up my alley. One of my favorite books is called ""The Hot Zone"" (it's about an ebola-like virus epidemic) and wanted to find a movie that discussed similar infectious disease topics. Contagion isn't a fast-paced/car chase-filled/explosions everywhere kind of movie, but the acting is solid and the story is very engaging.",1424908800,,516,4.808988764044944

4600435,4,B0058N2SBS,"Given the very mixed reviews on Amazon and in the media, I had low expectations of this film but one of the advantages of having family visit is that they bring DVD's that we wouldn't necessarily buy. In the case of Contagion, I'm glad they did. My preconceptions were of an unnecessary re-working of the excellent `Outbreak' with a modern big-name cast (although you can't get much bigger than Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo & Morgan Freeman) to pull in the crowds.

Inasmuch as both films were about the pandemic spread of an infectious disease my prejudice was well founded but Contagion is a very different film. It is almost a documentary describing the mechanism of disease progression and while that sounds rather dull, the film is far from dull. Admittedly, there are no car chases, people getting shot or stuff going bang but the plot and little conspiracy sub-plot roll along at a consistently well managed pace, the cast & script are generally superb and the science is plausible. The only let-down is Jude Law's laughable caricature London accent (which is odd considering that he is a South London lad - it could easily have been Dick Van-Dyke it was that bad); it grated to the point of interrupting the narrative.

All-in-all, though, a thoroughly watch-able and intelligent film which stands up well to comparison with Outbreak.",1421280000,,1340,4.898678414096916

Contagion could have been just another disaster movie, but to my delight is much more than that.  Its science appears to be accurate (and very informative), its heroes real human beings. And the tragedy -- one mankind could very well face -- is handled with sobriety.  But do not from these expressions get the idea that this is a boring film. Far from it! It instead goes between quietly thrilling and truly frightening.

4600454,4,B0058N2SBS,"I watched this movie around the time the Ebola outbreak was happening in Dallas. Probably not the best idea with fear running rampant, but I think it helped heighten my anticipation in this movie. It's about a virus that works fast and kills the person even faster. Gwyneth Paltrow's character brings it back to the US after a trip to Asia, and it spreads like wildfire, killing everyone who was in her mere presence.

There were some unbelievable parts in the movie, but it also makes you think about how we'd handle an outbreak of this caliber. Does such virus exist that could wipe out mankind in a matter of months? Are we prepared? With all of the mishaps with the CDC lately, it's hard not to get too freaked out about it.

If you're a germafobe, this movie might send you into a padded room - but it is definitely a thriller.",1419638400,,832,4.431372549019608

4600494,4,B0058N2SBS,"""Contagion"" proved itself  interesting enough though my first viewing was only  piecemeal, ""Contagion"" has been viewed by me some four times and purchased as well. It may be overstated but watching the film a fifth time is not out of the question. It is interesting to note that this is a film that a calculation seems to pay off. The scenes are not extended nor do they produce something over bloated. The scenes seemingly get to the point and continue to move. The film,to its credit brings the audience to nearing fear when we are able to as it were watch the calculations of the now Pandemic take hold. It is very useful to suggest that CDC protocols,WHO World Health Organization and other member communities  all appear to be involved. The is a dangerous viral disease which Elliot Goulds character one Dr. Sussman was something of a Hero as he,that is Dr. Sussman was the first to decode the Virus with a working  model made available to the Communities mentioned. The result of Dr. Sussmans contribution allowed trials to commence  in finding a vaccine..I might add this was a critical development and one which I had praise for science. This film is successful because it has all appearences of being scientific. The onset of the effects of this Pandemic requires full participation of Law Enforcement, National Guard,and Armed Forces. It is most certainly an interesting film worthy of another viewing. The film has many who are linked as to the success or failure of the effort made to as it were  develop a vaccine. The Women Doctor who places her life at risk almost is to much to bear. That was a true gamble,one that had the risk if the vaccine had not provided the host with the antibodies needed to protect itself the host  would of died. In a manner of speaking that is enough drama for one long day. Like I said this is a interesting film worth watching and in this particular mention worth watching again.",1417219200,,1925,4.660766961651918

The characters seemed one dimensional with little development.  I'm a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow. She's listed as a leading character. However, her screen time was barely more than a cameo.

That is because the point of the movie is not the characters but the virus, which is the true ""star"" of this movie.  It is a suspenseful and enlightening film with an ending that packs a punch.

How quickly can such a virus spread?  What can be done about it ... truly?  There's no way to have preventative measures in place, since there are so many viruses out there, many of which replicate more rapidly and become more virulent as they spread.  And even when taking all the precautions determined necessary, the virus can still win.

The element of suspense centers around not just who will get the virus or how will the CDC handle this world-wide pandemic, but just how the virus was contracted in the first place.  This is where the ending really hits home.  How the virus was transmitted to human beings in the first place.  One individual ignoring a standard hygiene practice and then engaging in a simple act, which many of us would think nothing of doing, creates a world-wide pandemic.

In reality, especially with all the inter-continental travel engaged in nowadays, this could easily happen.",1410220800,2,1244,4.73953488372093
4600626,4,B0058N2SBS,Movie is a great tool for teaching your children about potential viral epidemics such as Ebola. Also recommend Outbreak,1410220800,,119,5.315789473684211
4600627,5,B0058N2SBS,"CONTAGION was filmed in 2010 and released in 2011 as a conscious, intentional effort to portray as factually as possible exactly how a true worldwide pandemic would spread and what its actual effects would be.

That's why it is presented as a documentary format. Although the characters are fictional, the premise and its progression are depicted as accurately as possible. One of the consultants was journalist Laurie Garret, who was present at Ebola outbreaks in Africa and won a Pultzer for her Ebola pandemic reporting.

This film differs from 'Outbreak' in that 'Outbreak' is more of a fictional entertainment, with Dustin Hoffman as an impossibly heroic crusading CDC epidemiologist, and of course there's a Hollywood happy ending.
CONTAGION however wants to be taken seriously, and it wants to be a 'wake up call' that the 'next big pandemic' is inevitable, and that it's coming, and that the First World needs to be getting ready.

This makes it especially timely 3 years later, now that Ebola is raging out of control in West Africa.
Whatever happens with Ebola, everyone should see this film.
I recommend it as a point of reference, and as a vivid portrayal of a number of all too possible scenarios.

I welcome Comments below. I hope this review has been helpful.",1410048000,2,1274,4.9392523364485985

4600643,4,B0058N2SBS,"Well done movie with good acting and realism.  The CDC has been warning that one day a horrible contagion will strike, and this movie gives a good background of a fictional outbreak.  It showed the flip side of the coin with a lot of truth.  Immunizations made available in time of panic without going through the rigorous drug trials that are necessary for the protection of the public.  In real life Aspartame was one drug that was not thoroughly tested before it was released to the public and there are side effects associated with its consumption for sensitive people.  The movie celebrated the success of the world health organizations in their fight against communicable disease (which they deserve), but it was also brought up the influence of pharmaceutical companies and the profits they stand to make.

The latest Ebola outbreak is one to ponder.  CDC brought the patient back to the U.S. instead of sending a mobile lab with all the latest equipment to the country of origin.

4600671,2,B0058N2SBS,"Imagine the following ideas for a movie:

1. A top health official who is aware of a killer disease spreading, who struggles with how to deal with the issue not only professionally, but personally.

3. A health agent who investigates the spreading outbreak in Clarice Starling-esque fashion, while dealing with the danger of exposure.

4. A father who loses his wife to the disease, and his struggle to survive and protect his daughter in a rioting, quarantined city that has turned into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

5. A blogger who is convinced of the *conspiracy* of big pharma purposefully endangering the public in order to increase profits, while leading an irrational anti-science crusade in favor of non-functional homeopathic treatments.

6. An Amaerican health agent who gets kidnapped by a Chinese official in the hopes of getting a small village of innocents first in line for treatment, where the captive comes to sympathize with her captor's plight.

Now, take each of these ideas and mash them all up into one narrative. Choose an all-star cast for your movie, but give them nothing to do but grimly trudge through each of their own (mostly) independent storylines. Don't include much, if any, character development. And after 2 hours of this, stop filming and call that an ending. Voila! You've made ""Contagion"".

I thought this movie started out interesting enough, but it quickly bogged down into technical details and medical jargon. After a while, I came to realize that the creator of this movie was more interested in showing off all the research he did rather than craft a compelling story. The result is a mish-mash of storylines that ultimately go nowhere.

Everyone is so darn grim in this movie that they no longer seem human. The only one I could relate to at all was Sasha Baren Cohen as the lab tech who makes an extremely inappropriate joke. At least he still knows how to be somewhat human.

You get to see Heisenberg in a military uniform, so I guess that's something if you're a big Bryan Cranston fan. ""Say my name!""

You also get to see Gwyneth Paltrow laughing and smiling in a bar, as she laughs and smiles with people who she would never laugh and smile with in real life. She does this A LOT. And what the heck is she so happy about here anyway? It's just a plane layover. Nothing to get so excited about, lady! (I'm sorry, I just find Gwyneth Paltrow's acting to be vapid and annoying.)

So there you have it. Enjoy the movie's ""realism"", but I'd think you'd be better off just watching an actual documentary about epidemics. I know I would have enjoyed that more.

Still, the movie does have Bryan Cranston and ends with a nice U2 song, so +1 star for that. Enjoy :)",1405814400,,2710,4.718220338983051

We see in the very last scene the writer and film maker show, in this situation that disrupting a forrest ecosystem (by logging) can
touch off disastrous consequences. Whether you choose to believe this is possible or not it is a viable example of how such things could begin. If you want to know for certain then do you own research. Start by reading about the World Wide Flu Epidemic of 1918.

As someone who is currently working on their Ph. D. in the microbiology of infectious diseases, I also liked how scientifically accurate this film was. There are a few fudges in the movie, but I definitely appreciated the film's portrayal of the importance of scientific research to human health.

4600720,5,B0058N2SBS,"I don't understand all the negativity about this movie. Must every film be judged by the same
standard? The central character here is the virus which kills indescriminantly and the film does
a good job showing how helpless humanity would be if we were confronted by such a pitiless force. Oftentimes,
civilization hangs by a thread, and the director successfully showed us just how quickly that
thread can unravel. This film held my attention from start to stop. While it may not be the traditional
tearjerker type disaster movie, to which viewers are accustomed, the emotional detachment
on the part of the viewer isn't always a bad thing. In this case, it helps with understanding the scope and scale
of a global pandemic. Granted, this movie is done differently, but it's still a very good movie. Especially well done
was the use of music at the film's beginning to create tension and the use of the day counter to aid in
understanding the scale was a good choice.",1393977600,,967,4.761904761904762

4600724,2,B0058N2SBS,"The disparate plot lines, while led by big-name stars, never develop with any interest or coalesce into a riveting whole. Contagion is all surface, and government-pharmaceutical conspiracy theories or other potential subplots are never developed, making Jude Law's reporter character pointless. In fact, all the characters are shallow with poor dialogue, so their deaths are met with audience shrugs. Was this a book first? There are hints of a better story that the filmmaker wasn't adept enough to capture.

Read Margaret Atwood's dystopian triology ""Oryx and Crake"" if you really want a scary, plague-based tale of the potential end of the human race. Or watch Stephen King's ""The Stand.""

Obviously from a big studio.  The most evil character in the movie is a blogger, so they have to vilify independent news sources (in this case, great he's the bad guy) but they go out of their way to call bloggers ""Not real writers"" and refer to blogs as not being real news sources.

Kinda Agenda 21ish .... Make sure you line up to get your shot, the military will be watching you so don't skip ahead in line.

4600745,5,B0058N2SBS,Simply the best movie made on the subject of a viral outbreak... period. Of course I appreciate the clinical way it presents the subject. It never allows for any large displays of emotion. Love it for that. And as far as I've read- that really has been the only criticism- it's 'unemotional' demeanor. See it as a pro or con... that was the what the director wanted.,1386806400,,366,4.477611940298507
4600746,3,B0058N2SBS,"I think this movie tries to do too much. It tries to show the large scale effects of policy decisions, but it tries to be a deeply personal movie as well. The ensemble cast/multiple storyline style has been done well to accomplish this kind of effect, but here it feels stretched too thin. I never really connected with any one of the story-lines enough to care all that much.

As a thriller, it lacks great suspense, as a drama it lacks well rounded characters, as a polemic it lacks a clear target or message. Overall, I enjoyed it, but not over much, and I wouldn't watch it again. I would, however, buy the soundtrack, which was quite good.",1386460800,,644,4.4576271186440675

So there is nothing fake or a joke about a deadly virus that can easily be spread from country to country, and all it takes is that one person in the best example how something could spread worldwide is just like how AIDS started and there really is no cure for that.

But it's pretty accurate and also entertaining.  And for those looking for a kid or family friendly movie, while you see some events (a mother crashing and dying before her young son, an implied affair), there is no sex, no nudity, no graphic deaths by gunshot or dismemberment, no excessive violence.

4600768,5,B0058N2SBS,"Perhaps because epidemiology has always fascinated me, I have a penchant for biological mass disaster movies.
Rather than focusing on shock factors or unnecessary gore, ""Contagion"" portrayed a pandemic that could very easily happen tomorrow. It focused intently on the manner in which our globalized society advances the spread of disease. I was very impressed with all the different angles portrayed- local clinic & hospital response/confusion in the beginning, CDC & WHO participation & coordination - but also the political pressures that come along with dealing with such an outbreak. The way our Western so called ""civilized"" society begins to crumble in the face of an epidemic, the terrifying personal ramifications of a modern day quarantine (such as states closing their borders), and how ""snake oil"" salesmen are still very much a part of our culture.

This is the antithesis of a Hollywood movie: no high-octane action, no super-heroes, just realistic characters dealing with an epidemic in their own desperate way.  It follows a low-drama, documentary style approach that bounces between the governmental efforts to combat the virus and several human events stories that run through the movie. It has a similar feel to Traffic, which Soderbergh directed. The Matt Damon thread deals with the plight of the average family, the Jude Law thread deals with the financial profiteering aspect, and the Laurence Fishburne / Kate Winslet thread deals with the government response to the virus.

All the threads of this movie are very human, showing everyone's warts as they wrestle with the social ramifications of the virus.

The performances are all outstanding as you would expect. For some reason though, Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet's performances stand out to me. Very strong, very believable, very human.

While the Nipah virus incident was controlled before global pandemic (according to Wki), it was extremely contagious and deadly, killing most victims as well as physicians and other care providers.

4600818,4,B0058N2SBS,"I hope we humans never have to find out, but the movie CONTAGION is so convincing of what this country--and the world--would look like in the deadly wake of an airborne pathogen epidemic, that it sends shudders down the old backbone.  We see researchers and CDC officials (Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne) frantically race against time to find a vaccine; a CDC doctor (Kate Winslet) who actually goes out into the field to fight the disease; a sensationalist journalist (Jude Law) who claims the vaccine already exists, but Big Pharma is suppressing this info because it wants to make trillions in profits; an international medical researcher (Marion Cotillard) actually kidnapped in Asia and held hostage so a village can receive the vaccine; and a husband (Matt Damon) who meets the contagion head on when his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) returns from a business trip (monkey business, it turns out) in Asia, and becomes one of the first victims of the new disease.

And along the way, society as we know it goes to Hades in a hand basket.  Time to lock 'n load.

This is a gripping, taut, and (again) highly believable depiction of a mega-outbreak of a deadly disease, a disease killing millions.  The cast gives terrific performances, but (*spoiler!*) don't get too comfortable with several of them, for they aren't around long.  One star off because CONTAGION has too many subplots and story lines to keep track of; the film often gets in its own way.  Having said that, CONTAGION is still one grand dramatic thriller.  Finally, here's a little hint:  When in Asia, don't order the pork.

4600819,5,B0058N2SBS,"I read an amazing book awhile back entitled ""The Hot Zone,"" which I believe is mostly a non-fiction account of how a new strain of Ebola spread from Africa to the east coast of the United States.  The virus was contained, but just barely.  The potential consequences, laid out very nicely by the author of that work, were quite dire.  And so far for me, this film is the closest disaster-type film that demonstrates this same idea, albeit in pictures instead of words.

I hate to flog a dead horse -- OK, so I lied -- but I wrote a review of the film ""The Impossible"" awhile back.  After I wrote that review, I was skewered by ad hominems and appeals to emotion by other viewers, obviously logical fallacies to the logicians out there.  But anyways, I juxtaposed that film in a review of ""Aftershock"" later, where I argued that the survivors in the former were impossibly kind, while the survivors in the latter were impossibly cruel.  I also wrote that I enjoyed ""Aftershock"" more because at least it showed human behavior more correctly in a time of crisis.  But this film is probably right in-between the two, and I believe that the looting and crime that they show here are spot-on in believability.

And even Matt Damon, who usually plays the nice guy in most of his roles -- minus of course his role in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (a film that I also really liked) -- actually does a little Bad-Will-Hunting here himself.  Even he breaks at one point as his family needs food and supplies, and so the film shows him breaking into a neighbor's house and rummaging through that neighbor's refrigerator.  Ah, I say that, given enough pressure, you could even break Mother Teresa (assuming she were still alive), and I even have some proof of that:  she endured an exorcism herself before she passed away.  Perhaps the Devil was able to break her.  ""So there!"" and ""take that!"" I say to you disbelievers out there of bad human behavior!

Most disaster films just plain get it wrong.  ""Contagion"" just plain gets it right.  At least mostly so.  They show how the government tries to use disinformation to avoid a panic, and I also found this believable.  As a matter of fact, while watching, I was thinking about the whole asteroid thing that happened recently.  Supposedly, an earth-killer flew by at about a million miles away.  Luckily, it didn't hit us.  And the government was nice enough to tell us about it in advance, just as it was about to fly by at a very-safe-but-near-miss distance.  But I also thought the following:  what if the government knew that it WOULD have hit us?  Would they have given us that information?

I believe they would have tried to hide it.  Americans are often biased to think that the government will divulge the information, but only since they have told us about the negative cases in the past.  Those are easy.  And after all, it took a contractor recently to spill the beans that the government is listening in on our phone conversations.  (I'm not much into conspiracy theories myself, but it's also wise to not completely discredit them out of hand.  Sometimes the government does bad things, such as save all of our emails, as an example.)

Well, I say, ""Contagion is Contagious!""  Maybe not as good as ""The Hot Zone,"" and perhaps more of a 4.5.  But I'm rounding up to a 5, since so many disaster movies are just so, well, disastrous, while this one is just so good.",1371686400,,3410,4.591059602649007

4600823,5,B0058N2SBS,"""Contagion"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: ""Contagion"" follows the rapid progress of a lethal airborne virus that kills within days. As the fast-moving epidemic grows, the worldwide medical community races to find a cure and control the panic that spreads faster than the virus itself. At the same time, ordinary people struggle to survive in a society coming apart.

The cast led by Marion Cotillard (as Dr. Leonora Orantes), Matt Damon (as Mitch Emhoff), Laurence Fishburne (as Dr. Ellis Cheever), Jude Law (as Alan Krumwiede), Gwyneth Paltrow (as Beth Emhoff) & Kate Winslet (as Dr. Erin Mears) is excellent. The directing & cinematography by Steven Soderbergh (also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Scott Z. Burns is excellent.

The music by Cliff Martinez is excellent. The film editing by Stephen Mirrione is excellent. The casting by Carmen Cuba is excellent. The production design by Howard Cummings is excellent. The art direction by Abdellah Baadil, Simon Dobbin & David Lazan is excellent. The set decoration by Cindy Carr is excellent. The costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent.

This is an excellent film that is not only well-made and well-executed, but also entertaining, interesting and gripping, as well. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, your heart racing and your mind thinking at the same time. This is another excellent teaming of Matt Damon & Steven Soderbergh.

Most people thought that the CDC overreacted to the SARS outbreak but they clearly state that they would rather be guilty of overreacting than not treating any outbreak as seriously as it warrants.

4600840,3,B0058N2SBS,"It's like those ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New Year's Day"" movies...only a lot less happy.

I don't think director Steven Soderbergh ever met a large cast that he didn't like.  This movie reads like a ""who's who"" of the actor's world.  It has Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, that woman from ""Titanic"", Laurence Fishburne, Bryan Cranston (dude's in everything these days), Ross and Monica's father from friends, Sanaa Lathan, Jude Law...and more!

But you can have a cast of very good actors and that still doesn't mean the movie is going to work.  So does ""Contagion"" work?  Yes, it does.  As a slow boil drama.  But it deals with a weighty subject, a the issue of a worldwide catastrophy as a highly communicable fast killing virus breaks out.  The filmgoer should feel the weight of such an horrific event but this largely escapes us as Soderbergh goes about this project in an almost workmanlike procedural fashion.  Where is the hysteria and the sheer horror and sense of displacement that would occur as the virus spreads and becomes known?  ""Outbreak"", which was shot more as an action thriller, managed to give us at least a sense of this.  ""Contagion"" does not as it follows our characters, a few who are early afflicted with the disease and a lot of scientists who are out trying to trace its roots (***spoiler alert*** wash your hands and avoid the swine) and come up with a cure, to the barely triumphant conclusion.  And it seems to be trying to tell us something about ourselves, or share some moral.

I freely admit, though, that whatever the moral of the movie is I missed it.  It may be that mankind survives or dies at the whims of a disinterested bioligical world.  Or it could be that our salvation lies within our very biological beings and that SCIENCE (our modern god) is what is capable of saving us so long as we continue to worship and obey (study and act upon its laws) at its feet.  This has all been done before, quite frequently, especially in science fiction (both good and bad, mind you).  Here the movie feels like a hollow event, like there is or should be something more, but all we're left with is what is on the screen...and whatever cold chill might run up and down our spine the next time we see someone leave a restroom without washing their hands or have a flying commuter sneeze or cough near us.",1360540800,,2348,4.603365384615385

4600844,4,B0058N2SBS,"Waiting for her flight in an airport lounge, the adulterous Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow) is feeling a bit under the weather.  But she isn't the only one.  In Hong Kong, a young man wanders back to his apartment, stricken with a delirious fever.  Then there's the Ukrainian model in London, and the Japanese businessman in Tokyo.  All are crashing hard; and so begins director Steven Soderbergh's most recent film, Contagion.  Modeled, in many ways, after his four-time Oscar winning masterpiece, Traffic, this new film is an evocative journey into germaphobe's worst nightmare.

What makes this work so well is the casual intersection of stories that veer in and out of focus as the epidemic makes its way around the globe.  Where a lesser director might have succumbed to the desire to voyeuristically pump up the nightmarish body count, Soderbergh wisely shows a few intimate and unexpected deaths before driving the film to more elevated heights where we witness the medical community's valiant attempts to combat a global pandemic.  By avoiding the morbid horror-movie stereotypes, Soderbergh creates something that is far more terrifying: casual, incidental contact.

I highly recommend this film as one of the best I've seen in 2011.

4600850,4,B0058N2SBS,"Two things compelled me to see ""Contagion"".  The first reason is I am a huge fan of director Steven Soderbergh's Academy Award winning film ""Traffic"".  Second, I have heard a lot of positive buzz about ""Contagion"" and decided to check it out.  While it's not 100% perfect, I was certainly not disappointed with my decision to see it and was very entertained.

One of the reasons why ""Contagion"" works so well is its top notch cast.  From Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Marion Cotillard and Kate Winslet to veterans Matt Damon, Jude Law and Elliot Gould the parts are very well cast and the actors do very well in their respective roles.  I am not a huge fan of Matt Damon but I believe he gives one of the best performances of his carrer in ""Contagion"".  His character seems to represent the every day person.  He is fortunate enough to be genetically immune to the deadly virus at the center of the film, but one thing he is not immune to, is its deadly consequences.  His wife Beth (Paltrow) and his stepson Clark (Paltrow's ten year-old son from a previous marriage.) die within hours of each other.  He and his teenage daughter from his previous marriage must remain in indefinite isolation, Mitch learns that not only was his wife unfaithful, she was the person who indavertently started the epidemic by a very sad case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Rioting and looting is happening all around him.  While he was not directly effected by the virus it has had devestating impact on him in many ways.

Every movie, even a medical thriller such as this, needs to have a villain and Jude Law excels here as anti-government conspiracy theorist Allan Krumwaide.  He is terrific as a man convinced that the virus, named Meningoencpehilitis Virus-1 (MEV-1) was in fact manufactured by the US government and released intentionally in order for pharmeceutical companies could earn billions marketing the cure.  What made me like ""Contagion"" even more is that Allan is soon revealed to be nothing more than a money grabbing opportunist and a liar.  As Matt Damon represents the every day person, Law represents the many conspiracy theorists who emerge whenever any type of diaster emerges.  They all claim to be heroes but they are actually (I know the next part of this statement is not going to make me too many friends.) nothing more than liars and frauds.  I'm glad the movie shows that.

Despite the fact that he is only in two scenes Elliot Gould is excellent as Dr. Ian Sussman.  The doctor who defies orders and makes the necessary breakthroughs needed to help develop a vaccine to MEV-1.  His scene where he confronts (and ultimeately slam dunks) Jude Law's character is the best scene in the entire movie.  Gould has the best line in the movie when he tells Law ""Blogging is not writing.  It's graffiti with punctuation.""  Enough said there!

I think it was a very smart move on the part of writer Scott Burns and director Soderberg to have the final sequence of just how the epidemic started at the end of the movie.  That sequence is very well done and even a little frightening.  It makes you stop and think how a simple thing as cutting down two trees can have such an impact on people and things.  I always enjoy watching that sequence.

I can't wrap up my review without, in all fairness, stating that there is a flaw in the movie.  I had a little trouble buying how quickly MEV-1 spread and how quickly it killed its victims.  I know there is some basis in fact for this.  The Spanish Influenza outbreak in the early twentieth century (Shortly before the end of World War I.) spread rapidly and killed millions of people.  Still, there were survivors of that epidemic.  In ""Contagion"" it appears everybody who was infected died within a day or two.  I found that a little hard to believe.

With that said, I believe ""Contagion"" is a well made thriller that's is worth renting or (in my case) owning.  I recommend you take some time to see it.  Just don't eat anything that happens to fall out of a bats' mouth and wash your hands!",1357344000,,4067,4.612813370473537

4600871,4,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion(released Sept/11)is a chilling look at what could happen when an unknown virus breaks out and the CDC and their worldwide counterparts do everything they can to stop it. The film stars Matt Damon as Mitch Emhoff,Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Ellis Cheever,Jude Law as Alan Krumwiede,Gwyneth Paltrow as Elizabeth ""Beth"" Emhoff,Kate Winslet as Dr. Erin Mears,Elliott Gould as Dr. Ian Sussman and many others.
The story starts with the players who contract a nasty virus of unknown origin,which spreads slowly throughout the world. As is always the case,third world countries get hit the hardest and quickest. We start our focus on Paltrow who is an American businesswoman on a trip to Hong Kong. She arrives home sick and she spreads it to her son. They both end up dying. The CDC gets involved and Fishburne,who is put in charge there,tries in vain,at the start,to put a lid on the quickly spreading disease. Gould,a doctor in San Fran,comes up with a promising cure route. In the meantime Law who is an internet blogger with many followers,is turning up his own heat on the entire scenario. He does not believe any of the explanations official are coming out with. In fact he himself comes down with the virus and through the use of a homeopathic remedy,cures himself,which goes largely unnoticed by the CDC.This inflames public opinion even more. He also is interviewed on national TV and accuses Fishburne of notifying his own family over the general populace. Fishburne then faces a hearing down the line into his conduct.
The CDC in the meantime is trying to trace ground zero of the virus. A WHO rep in Hong Kong is kidnapped and is held in a remote village. She is eventually exchanged in lieu of a batch of developed antibiotics later in the film. It turns out the batch is just placebos,useless. As the developed vaccine gets distributed,life starts to get back to normal for the world(until the next outbreak).As the film ends we see in flashback where the virus originated from. A bulldozer from Paltrows company knocked down a tree in which a bat was nesting. It bit into a piece of banana,which it in turn flew with and rested with on a beam in a farm shed,over top of some pigs. The banana dropped and the pigs digested it. The pigs in turn are shipped into the cities and one infected one arrives in the very restaurant Paltrow was in,in Hong Kong.
The film studies in detail how an organization such as the CDC operates,what protocols they use and how they become viral detectives,in search of an answer and a cure. They work in a logical and progressive manner,which to many would appear far too slow. As with many medical cures there are medical heroes,as there are here. The film doesn't just stop there,but shows the other side of the coin in the form of Law. He is an internet guru who many folks listen to and who slams the CDC and big pharma in general for being in cahoots. He cures himself and it is just left there. The director is giving as much latitude to the ""official"" side,as it is to the unofficial/internet. It also shows how our very own social and business structures slowly but surely break down as nurses and a myriad of union members stop working. This brings goods and material supplies to a halt,which in turn triggers hoarding and line ups. And of course this triggers small riots as people get less and less tolerant of others. It is certainly a riveting film which leaves one uncomfortable afterwards,as we see just how easy a virus can spread. But that was the goal of the director and writers,and they certainly achieved it here.
The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a couple of minute cartoon-ish PSA announcement.
All in all a disturbing ""realistic"" look at the outbreak of an unknown virus and  how the CDC and their world wide counterparts deal with such things. Throughout we are given a disturbing peak at ourselves and the straws we grasp for in times of turmoil. It isn't pretty,but it engages the viewer. Recommended.",1353628800,2,4019,4.692634560906516

The suspense was there, but what I experienced is not a beginning and an ending of a movie, rather explosion and disappearance of a movie with much prospect. In other word, to me, the movie started as a solid piece, then got diluted. Pass, you won't miss much.",1352419200,2,592,4.390909090909091
4600875,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion is a decent movie, but not a great one. The plot of the movie is simple:  A mysterious new infectious disease breaks out, it spreads rapidly across the world, and altruistic medical scientists labor to bring it under control.  The idea for this film was reportedly inspired by the 2003 SARS outbreak. This is not virgin territory.  This same theme was the basis for the 1995 movie, Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo, and it was covered even better in Richard Preston's best-selling book, The Hot Zone.

Contagion does benefit from a stable of A-list actors and director, Steven Soderbergh.  Befitting a big-budget, Hollywood film, the cinematography, international film sets (Hong Kong, London, Geneva), and technical production aspects of the film are excellent.  The plot is fast-paced, but it harbors no surprises and is predictable.

The actors give good performances, but the characters are one-dimensional and almost stereotypical.  Matt Damon, as a harried father, scrambles about, frenetically protecting his daughter from the virus, after the death of his cheating wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) and son.  Playing a character that doesn't quite fit into the plot, Jude Law portrays a sleazy blogger that attacks the Centers for Disease Control, while secretly profiting from a homeopathic, Forsythia extract cure.  Laurence Fishburne plays the role of a heart-of-gold CDC researcher that is more of a caricature than a character.  First, he is threatened with disciplinary action for warning his fiance to leave Chicago, one of the disease epicenters.  (This warning presumably precipitates an immediate mass exodus from Chicago.)  Then he gives his dose of the precious nasal vaccine to the janitor's son, rather than immunize himself.  This is the stuff of sainthood.  The actors do a god job with the material they are given, but there was little opportunity for nuance or complexity in their characters.

In short, the movie is well-acted, well-crafted, technically competent, and scientifically accurate.  But it has a thin plot and shallow, one-dimensional characters.  Contagion can provide an evening's entertainment, but it will leave no lasting memories.",1351728000,,2190,5.410029498525073
4600876,4,B0058N2SBS,"Its def worth watching @ least once, but I think I was expecting too much from it.  Although the ending did make up for other parts of the movie!  Its not for kids, there is a disturbing scene or 2.",1350086400,,198,3.925
4600877,4,B0058N2SBS,"You know that sign that's in public bathrooms demanding all employees must was their hands?  ""Contagion"" is like the movie version, only the lesson learned will stick with you at a lot longer.

""Contagion"" begins on Day 2 as Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong speaks affectionately over the phone to a man who is not her husband, her wedding ring clearly visible in the shot.  That indiscretion will embroil her family in a worldwide pandemic when she brings a plague home with her.  It spreads from her to her son and from there to the world.  Matt Damon plays her long-suffering husband Mitch, trying to protect his daughter as the world falls apart.

That human story tries to anchor the global events as the virus spirals out of control.  Governments are at first too slow to recognize the threat and then too slow to respond as the contagion outpaces laws, politics, and civility.  It's not long before looting, murder, and mass outages wrack all the major population centers.

Throughout the film we follow the stories of individual scientists doing their level best to stem the insidious tide.  Some will rise to the occasion, others selfishly protect their loved ones, and still others simply die trying. Paralleling the plague of the body is the plague of the mind, embodied by Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) as a popular countercultural blogger proposing fictional cures , and his actions prove that disinformation can be more deadly than the virus itself.

Despite the personal stories of the scientists and Emhoff, ""Contagion"" is oddly bloodless.  The interspersed newscasts never quite bring home the visceral horror of a world gone mad.  There's so much time hopping between geographies that we never stay anchored with one story long enough to really care about the characters.

Still, ""Contagion"" makes up for its lack of narrative with Steven Soderbergh's excellent cinematography. The bare, haunting score accentuates the camera's lingering moments on hands and surfaces where the invisible virus lurks.  Every sniffle, every handshake, takes on a new grim significance.  By the end of the film we get to see what happened in Day 1, but by then we already know what's coming.

""Contagion"" is as much as a public service announcement as it is an entertaining film.  The fact that it manages to be both is still an achievement.  And remember kids, always sneeze into your elbow, always wash your hands, and never sleep with strangers.",1349308800,5,2453,4.9681372549019605

4600880,5,B0058N2SBS,"First, it's a great catastrophe movie. Star-power doesn't guarantee a good flick, Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburn, Jude Law, and a flock others do their best to raise this movie a level, and their efforts pay off. The script gives them a chance to do their best - a believable outbreak, as contagious as SARS and as deadly as Ebola starts in a remote corner of the world. It propagates at the speed of jet travel to every major population center, and then the fatalities start to come in. It doesn't reach ""Mad Max"" levels of post-apocalyptic collapse, but does show how social structure sould shudder under the blows. And, in a thoroughly modern touch, the rationality of the CDC is offset by a wingnut internet conspiracy theorist who believes that the government is suppressing life-saving floral extracts.

Among all disaster flicks, this stands out for one reason: it gets the science right. Ian Lipkin, M.D. and director of the Northeast Biodefense Center, consulted heavily. The movie virus, although fictional, followed the same path to people via bats and pigs as the real-world Nipah virus did. The movie virus fictionally attacks a genuine human receptor, but the imagined protein actually bonds to a genuine receptor site in biochemical simulations. Lipkin had Winslet pipetting and running gels, and showed Elliot Gould how to handle liquid nitrogen without freezing his hand off (as reported in Science magazine, 2 Sep 2011). Lipkin also suggested the bogus cures spreading across the internet, as actually happened in the SARS outbreak.

That said, they didn't do so well on some of the CDC procedures, but hey. They got a big one right, and set the standard for future plague movies. What they did right, they did beautifully right - in addition to making some good entertainment.

4600881,4,B0058N2SBS,"I watched Contagion with my wife and we both agreed that Steven Soderbergh has an eye for pretty women.  Four of them star in the movie in question, but we watched in dismay as two of them wound up grotesquely disfigured and abused.  One of them winds up with the skin pulled right off her face a la a memorable horror scene in the 1991 Michele Soavi import La Setta, produced by Dario Argento.  I don't want to spoil any surprises so I won't tell you who's who, but another beautiful woman winds up kidnapped and forced to teach Chinese schoolchildren in a remote province of China, and yet she manages to stay as drop dead gorgeous and coiffed as if she had Anouk Aimee's hairdresser combing her up after every class.  I never did figure that one out, but the implication, my wife said, is that she didn't really mind being taken hostage at all; we thought maybe she had fallen for her principal captor, or at any rate she believed him when he said he wanted only health for his village and would seize it by any means necessary.  She had beautiful sweaters and pearls, for a schoolteacher but that made sense, because she was actually not a teacher at all but a--u oh, mustn't say, that would be a giveaway about which of Soderbergh's four stars it was.

Now they look considerably past their prime, but wouldn't you, if one of you was a blogger with a fierce conviction that the common forsythia, like the bush my grandma used to have in her side yard, could cure the outbreak, stop it cold, only the Center for Disease in Control in Atlanta wasn't letting the truth be known, and the other of you was this glum mournful widower who has to put on his own prom for his teenage daughter because of the quarantine?  I won't say which is which, but let me tell you, there were many creepy scenes but none sop creepy as our widower trying to turn his living room into Prom Night with yards and yards of white stain ribbon and a weird prom gown delivered in a plastic bag.  My wife and I were surprised to find that he wasn't supposed to be unnaturally involved with his daughter, it was just supposed to be a cute thing he was doing to make her feel better about the disease ravaging Minneapolis.  I have to say that the movie was filled with surprises and I felt that the blog thing was right up to the minute two years ago or whenever this movie came out.",1347494400,,2550,4.311715481171548
4600882,1,B0058N2SBS,"The premise of this movie was fairly straightforward. A virulent virus, much like the Spanish flu of 1918 that killed somewhere between 40 and 80 million people, is spreading rapidly, endangering the life of Kate Winslet and all of humanity. Normally, I would hunker down with a bowl of popcorn and a quart of ginger ale to watch a movie like this. But I found myself getting very bored after only a few minutes.

The first problem with this movie is that it was horribly written. There are whole sections in which the characters say nothing, but just move their mouths to the accompaniment of tense music. Those were the good parts. The actual dialogue was so devoid of emotion that silence was preferable. And the characters were so bland and undeveloped that it was impossible to care whether they lived or died.

The second major problem was the premise. Supposedly, an infected bat bites a banana which a pig in Hong Kong then eats, and when the pig is slaughtered, the cook who prepares it for consumption doesn't wash his hands, and then shakes hands with Gwyneth Paltrow, who touches her face and then gets sick and dies. What kind of virus is this? It can be transmitted via saliva like a herpesvirus, survive going through a pig's GI tract like an enterovirus, end up in the blood somehow like blood-borne encephalitis-causing viruses, then get transmitted again via an object (hands), and then enter the body through the mucous membranes (mouth and/or nose), somehow end up in the lungs, and then migrate to the nervous system. It was as if the writers wanted to have it all - a virus which could be transmitted equally by saliva, feces, and blood, and which could survive both interferon-containing saliva and the depredations of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, as well as live outside the host on various objects - and which can kill you in a few days.

If, in fact, a virulent neurotropic virus could be transmitted in this casual a manner we would all be dead. (Spanish flu, by the way, only killed people who had previously caught a different flu. When the two viruses combined in their hosts they formed a fatal new virus.) We are surrounded by viruses - of all types - and the reason they haven't killed us all is because viruses mutate rather quickly into less lethal forms so as not to destroy their hosts. We may not need them, but they need us. What neither of us need is this movie.",1347062400,12,2407,4.619158878504673
4600883,3,B0058N2SBS,"An American woman returns from a business trip in Honk Kong feeling sick and within a few days she has a seizure and eventually dies at the hospital. In Honk Kong, London and other parts of the world other people are dying from the same unknown illness. The Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization begin studying the disease as more and more people become infected while others, like the original woman's husband, are immune. The disease is eventually discovered to have originated in Hong Kong and has characteristics of both a bat and a pig. Armed with this information doctors try to create a treatment while outside, society is breaking down. Food is scarce, crime is rampant and the flames of discontent are being fanned by a disingenuous internet blogger claiming there is a cure that the American government is keeping secret.

Contagion is a well made movie with excellent performances by all involved. It does a credible job of showing how easily a disease like this can spread and how vulnerable we all are. It is also scary how quickly society can decay in the face of an emergency no one clearly understands. Lies and rumors spread almost faster than the disease. People will believe almost anything in order to keep hope alive. The characters were very realistic, with both noble and ignoble tendencies whether they were in power or part of the citizenry.

My only quibble is whether this movie was necessary. Other movies about this same basic scenario have come before Contagion, so did we really need another one, no matter how well made?",1346976000,,1575,4.82962962962963

Focusing on various characters, the film takes a realistic look at what might happen if there ever was a viral outbreak in the world and the various viewpoints gives the film a real human undertone running throughout; the worried father, the focused investigators, the scientists trying to find a cure, the independent blogger. It made the movie very believable and almost documentary-like. I mean with millions of people dying and society descending into anarchy, will there be people or corporations who look to profit from it? You betcha.

Director Steven Soderbergh keeps the pace brisk, so it never feels lagging, and things get tenser as the days whither on, emotions begin to run high and people become on edge. It's not his best film, but it is enjoyable and engaging and worth a watch, the cast of big names, including the ones not mentioned on the cover, were all brilliant.

It shows the fits and starts and the messiness of doing public health and in-vitro research.  The human dimension of misinformation (some selfishly deliberate), confusion, desperation, and the family and peer bonds that hold us together is excellently developed.  For once, the human dimension of the scientific endeavor is well portrayed and I am thankful for the story of the good that those of us who have done basic research have endeavored to do.

While some scientific shortcuts are taken to progress the story line they are reasonable enough to suspend credulity.  This is a scary and realistic movie and makes me wonder what a filovirus with the epidemiology of influenza could do to the human population.  Lots of food for thought here.

This is science fiction at its very best.  It is so much better than those special effects movies that ignore basic physics so blatantly.  I'd put it on par with some of the best science fiction like 2001, Contact, Gattaca.",1345161600,,1206,4.99

She contracts a deadly virus that spreads like wild fire and is contagious by touch and body fluids (sneezing and coughing). Death comes within a few days and those who catch this flu have a 25 % to 30% chance to die.

Governments are paralyzed in trying to find the source of the disease and a possible cure. Even if a cure is found how can you quickly immunize billions of people worldwide? Normal people are rioting and stealing from each other......

This movie is a possible scenario of another Spanish Flu type epidemic where 50 to 100 million people died from 1918 to 1920 and 500 million were infected. Based on today's population the figure would be over 3.5 times worse. This movie is based on an actual potential disaster and it clearly shows how mankind is totally unprepared for such an event.

The movie was pretty good and characters of Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) were played pretty well. Where the movie fell down is that there is just too much data thrown at the audience and it may be difficult for some people to get their arms around the storyline.

The microbiologist reviewer feels 95% of us don't understand this movie.  No: that's why the plot unfolds as it did--so we would.  But I did not know what the CDC and scientists would have to face with political machinations and Big Pharma greed...I should have.  This is a cautionary tale in my eyes.  Instead of using evolution as a political knee jerker or religious boogeyman, can we not study and learn from it, and try to be prepared?

4600892,4,B0058N2SBS,"The only reason I'm not giving Contagion a 5-star rating is because I'm not particularly fond of the way the movie ends.  Yes you will see in fine detail the much needed explanation for a deadly virus that attacks millions of people around the world (especially Hong Kong, England and America) but I feel the film ends too abruptly.  Small complaint I suppose, but I didn't see it coming and I would have liked more.

Anyway, as you can probably guess by the title of the film, Contagion is about a deadly virus that attacks millions of people around the world... exactly what I mention in the previous paragraph, lol.  There's really not much more to the storyline than that, however what Contagion does remarkably well is contain a perfect balance of drama and suspense.  In fact, while quite often the first half of the film ventures dangerously close to boredom territory by dragging its feet with predictable writing that hardly goes the extra mile to stand out from other deadly virus movies, what it makes up for is keeping the surprise factor intact.  Who will be the next person to come into contact with the virus?  I really enjoyed the mysteries and surprises.

Unless I missed something, I can't recall there being an explanation for whatever happened to the woman who traveled overseas and came down with the virus symptoms while staying in her hotel room.  I must have missed a vital segment because it seems unlikely such an important character (at the time, at least) would just be writen off like that.  Then again she *did* sort of resemble Matt Damon's wife so maybe I just got the two faces mixed up.

Speaking of Matt Damon, I'm used to seeing Matt run around city blocks and save either himself, or somebody else in dramatic fashion (usually before a bomb explodes!)  In Contagion, he's significantly more relaxed and easy going.  It's because he plays the role of a father, and after losing his wife and son -despite not showing much emotion which is definitely atypical for *any* human being after such a traumatic experience- he's still going around searching for answers pertaining to the virus but perhaps not *quite* as much as you'd expect.  The storyline definitely switches between several different characters, and does so quite often.

Near the end, the suspense seems to disappear and a return to one drama segment after another comes around again.  Not really a problem however.  Perhaps the highlight for me is when Matt throws a prom dance for his daughter and even decorates the living room to make it as realistic as possible (since the schools across the country have been closed down).

Anyway my favorite actor is probably the British guy who was able to cleverly expose peoples lies, however that came around to bite him in the behind as you'll discover later on.

Although every character's story revolves around the deadly outbreak--from the unfortunate Patient Zero (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the compassionate WHO doctor (Marion Cotillard) to the earnest CDC investigator (a disturbingly stiff Kate Winslet) to the muckraking blogger (Jude Law) who sees a conspiracy at work --the film tells the story of the virus: its insinuation into the world population, the havoc it wrecks on humanity, the race to find a vaccine, and the ultimate resolution. Steven Soderbergh creates an appropriate sense of chaotic detachment, mirroring what in all likelihood would actually happen in the event of such an outbreak, and he quite realistically depicts the almost bureaucratic way in which such a pandemic would be ""managed,"" leaving us with a sense that a global viral outbreak would prove to be more than ""just"" a health crisis.

It does a great job of progressing from what appears to be a hopeless situation for some characters and the world in general to the progression to a better (???) outcome.

Wars, concentration camps, etc. This flick is about the exact opposite thing: Government workers (the CDC mainly) are saving people from a malevolent virus-based plague. This has, of course, never happened, but who knows? This virus behaves as no other virus in history does, insofar as it can be caught any number of ways.  Viruses specialize as regards how they are transmitted to a host.  But not in this movie.

There is no real plot here except 1) there is a virus-based plague; and 2) the Government swings into action to find a cure. Then society starts to break down (which has never happened in modern times in response to a plague, but who knows?)...

There are some big named stars in this flick, but mostly the film is an infomercial about how lucky we are to have Government researchers standing around at taxpayer expense to cure Bird Flu or some other plague that might happen some day but never has. Not much room left for acting or drama.

I've jumped frequently and been tense at one moment or another, but the most vicious ghoul or hideous monster has ever struck lasting fear because deep down, everything being thrown on the screen is pure make-believe. It wasn't until the smallest attacker presented itself that the paranoia stayed with me as I left the theater.

From Steven Sonderbergh, the Oscar-winning director of Traffic, Contagion is a frightful drama in a tangible way that is much too easy to relate to. Instead of relying on frightening characters and using extravagant effects, the doomsday film involves the audience, allowing it to surpass that which is typical of its drama.

The concept of a supervirus with no known cure is not altogether unfamiliar. Everyone remembers the recent H1N1 scare that prompted widespread fear and a consequent rushed vaccination. Contagion asks the question, ""What if an infection were as severe and widespread as feared?""

Rather than give a concrete answer, the empty shell of characters go through the life of the new disease, starting on day two. The steps that are taken do not necessarily show what would happen or even what might happen, but the story does cast a light on the political, social, economic and logistic problems that come with a virus epidemic.

Just as Traffic was a look into the drug trade and the stories of people involved, either directly or indirectly, Contagion is a glance at humanity and the assumptions and interactions that surround public health.

While watching, I found myself angry at those who doubted the severity of the situation. I scoffed at the many who disregarded the correct procedures to limit exposure. Yet, during the H1N1 scare I found myself sick in bed for two days after ignoring the suggestion of vaccination.

The movie can be slow at times but is driven well by an outstanding score by Cliff Martinez. While still sticking to his trademark of strong guitar riffs and heavy percussion, Martinez takes a note from 2010's Oscar winning score for The Social Network and fills the movie with electronic melodies and fast moving overlays that add another layer of tension to already stressful situations.

Where the lead characters played by Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law were primarily flat and empty, the plot was dense and filled with interest. Several different layers existed within each aspect of the virus' progression. Even now, I'm just beginning to realize the huge significance of some of the smallest scenes or pieces of dialogue.

During the movie, I found myself fully conscious of every time I went to scratch my nose or rub my eyes and found myself wondering who had sat in this seat before me. Suddenly, the world of germs wasn't just something to be feared.

After an ending that makes the on-screen situation all too possible, the next big scare won't be so easy to dismiss.

The ups are the performances - for the most part, the high-profile actors take a sober, realistic approach to their subject matter and carry the film beautifully;  also the script, which counterpoints the personal aspects of the illness and its impact on families, at the same time as a team of scientists race against the clock to understand the virus - as it mutates its way out of their grasp at every point.

The downside, I'm sorry to say, was a ridiculous caricature of a conspiracy theorist blogger, played with an almost camp sense of overkill (and a bewilderingly bad and inexplicable Australian accent) by Jude Law.  In reality, the media aspect of this story is a fascinating one - how should the media act in a pandemic?  How do they convey the genuine seriousness of the situation without creating mass panic?  But it's barely touched upon here, instead allowing Law's ridiculous Tintin-esque cub scout to chase senior doctors around, bleating tructulantly in a silly accent.

On the flipside, special mention should be given to Jennifer Ehle, who has a shamefully peripheral part as Ally Hextall, the key research viriologist coolly obsessed with isolating, and eventually immunising against, the virus.  Ehle brings a thrilling calm to the role; a scientists' quiet awe at the extraordinary sophistication of the virus she's tackling, and an equally understated confidence when discussing the virus with colleagues or in press conferences.  It's a beautiful handling of a small, but key, role and since so few others have mentioned her in amongst the higher profile actors, I think she warrants a very special commendation.

There are no zombies, no shocks and horrors, so it will not appeal to the torture-porn crowd, or the horror movie afficionado.  Instead its a credible tackling of a potentially devastating issue - and all the more frightening because of it.",1336089600,,2119,4.9914772727272725

4600909,4,B0058N2SBS,"The opening of the movie reminds me of ""12 Monkeys"" were a world wide epidemic is started by a person in an airplane. I really enjoyed the ""geek"" aspect of the movie as those who look at the virus infection do so from a logical, mathematical, scientific aspect as one might expect. We also have the personal aspect of people dying from the infection and their stories and of course the reporter/blogger who gets no respect. (My title is a line from the movie and is not to be considered my personal opinion.)

As you can imagine, the virus structure is unique, it travels rapidly, and the body doesn't know how to handle it. Fortunately it has a short incubation period and acts like typical viruses, i.e. not spreading in colder environments. The movie centers on isolating infected people and trying to figure out the origin of the disease. It also deals with the more mundane aspects such as the specifics of burials, quarantines, irrational thinking, and big pharmaceutical companies. In doing so it jumps around a lot, with numerous subplots and no real central character. I believe this is done to give the audience ""the feel"" of the mobility of the virus, and world panic and not because the film director and editor are idiots.

A virus is borne not because God wants it, not because there is someone who devised it and sent it other people in the mail, but because a few simple accidents in nature occur.  What ensues is a gruelling and very human battle against this disease, as Soderberg follows the head of the CDC (Lawrence Fishburne), a simple man (Matt Damon) who loses his wife in the opening scene (you get to see Gwyneth Paltrow get sick and die, and unlike in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000050FEN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;you get to see the details).

Kate Winslet plays Dr. Ben Mears, a self sacrificing woman who travels the world to research the disease on behalf of the CDC and pays a great price.  Jude Law plays the truly chilling Alan Krumwiede, a wannabe writer/popular blogger who takes advantage of the situation for money and prestige, almost a Hitleresque figure.

4600927,4,B0058N2SBS,"--SPOILER ALERT--

""Contagion"" is the coherent and compelling story of a major pandemic set into America's present-day stupidities of insufficient preparation, anti-intellectual societal climate, and the hundred years of social engineering by corporate greed and political corruption for the sake of the superrich.

The storyline provides good emphasis on the reaction, competencies, courage, and human failings of frontline scientists.  Matt Damon's character, Mitch Emhoff, is Mister Ordinary Citizen standing up to the deaths of his wife and stepson at the pandemic's beginning--and protecting his temporarily safe teen-age daughter--with quiet heroism.  Elliot Gould's excellently-played character, Dr. Ian Sussman, ignores and illegally sidesteps an official order to close down his lab, knowing that he has resources that will speed curtailing the pandemic.  He does that and then hands over his results to the proper authorities without any suggestion of profiteering.

And there are other breath-taking heroes, along with some dispicable villans.

However, the American stupidities are glossed over as if the filmmakers were afraid to talk about the elephants in the living room.  They are glossed over as if these conditions have righteous reasons to exist--as if the American people have done the very best that can be done against a govt that has been rampantly illegitimate since at least 1913.

The US govt has been a principal in the manufacturing of corporate greed and political corruption since before the end of WWI, when the monied elites lobbied for the shut-down of the people's direct democracy overhauls of state govts.  It was our ""Reform Era"", and it threatened to end superrich domination of the American cash cow.

From 1898 to 1918, organized citizens forced direct democracy features into their constitutions to allow the people to deal with govt illegitimacies.  Today, there are 18 states in which the sovereign people have direct control of their now-thoroughly illegitimate govts.  Those direct democracy features are now unused--when they are desperately needed--because of the public's socially-engineered conviction that they would do more harm than good.  So speaketh the superrich.  Corporate greed and political corruption win every day.  The public's mass fascism goes hand-in-glove with govt's mass fascism.  We've been socially engineered into conforming with whatever is best for the superrich and their progeny.  And now we're voting ourselves to death against corruption-aided computers that rob us of fair elections.  (Stop voting, dummies, until justice is done against the illegitimacies.)

Our social engineering--directing us away from any rational preparation so that we continue to spend into the already established coffers of the superrich--bit us on the butt badly when Katrina struck New Orleans.  It will bite us badly again when the contagion of the next pandemic hits us (the birds are taking care of weaponizing  bird flu, as a scientist quips in the film, ""Contagion"").  And it will bite us badly again when the supervolcano at Yellowstone erupts to fry and and bury a half to three-quarters of the US landmass.  Superrich caretakers Bush and Obama have given us a curtain of controlled media and junk-scientists to pooh-pooh away the now red-zoned, super-sized caldera at Yellowstone.

All of the factors to red-zone that supervolcano, to indicate that this one can erupt any day, have demonstrated that they're in place.  But the junk scientists continue to crow that it may be thousands of years before any serious erruption happens.  No worries.  No need for any prepartion whatsoever.

If it weren't for the Yellowstone supervolcano's implications of world-wide volcanic winter for 5-10 years--and the major destruction that a volcanic winter can bring to the global food supply--we simply would not have science news from anywhere about what we face when Yellowstone blows up.  As it is, we have Internet web sites that give us access to the science being done in other countries.  And that is in spite of major pooh-poohing of Internet resources being done by global elites and their political dogs.

If Yellowstone produces a middling supereruption of middling explosiveness, it's blast-kill zone is projected to be a 600-mile radius.  About 20 million Americans live inside that radius.  Who do we see about their lack of preparation?

Our ignorance is bliss for the superrich and their parasitic puppet politicians.  However, as the film, ""Contagion"", effectively shows for those with eyes to see, what we don't know can kill us.

Did the film show us the fastest way to a pandemic vaccine?  Or did it show us a very slow way along which the superrich can maximize their obscene profits?  Again.

If it showed us the way that the superrich get to maximize their obscene profits, then it is just another classical sophistry for the superrich.  Lies bundled in plausible falsehoods so that we don't object too much when they actually drag us through it.

There've been a lot of classical sophistries wrapped into popular films lately for the benefit of the superrich.  The ones that jump to mind are ""Syriana"" (George Clooney--2005--CYA sophistry for the corporate greed and political corruption corporatism of our nazified govt and big oil); ""The Dark Knight"" (Heath Ledger--2008--CYA sophistry for murderous politicians who are the heroes that war-by-deception neocons need); and ""From Paris With Love"" (John Travolta--2010--CYA sophistry for CIA evils from kidnapping and rendition to torture and murder because one cowboy kills anybody associated with terrorists who everyone wants dead.  Hip-hip-hooray for the CIA.  Airheads and morons, UNITE.)

Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans think that 'sophistry' means what the superrich-controlled, whitewashed dictionaries say it means.  Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans aren't educated enough to know the details of the ""1st Sophistic"" and the ""2nd Sophistic"", the eras of sophistry centering on the lives of Aristotle and Cicero, respectively.

Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans can be persuaded by pooh-poohs and plausible falsehoods to love anything--e.g.,the shredding of the Constitution, the evaporation of the Declaration of Independence, and the vaporizing of every right and liberty fought, bled, and died for by fighting Americans since 1776.  WW2, Korea, Vietnam, and Gulf veterans?  Go play in traffic.

In the next pandemic, the superrich's obscene profits won't just cost us the trillions of dollars they ripped out of us in the 2008 financial meltdown.  (Anyone prosecuted for those frauds yet?  In your dreams.)  The next pandemic can easily cost us many tens of millions of human lives.  1918's Spanish flu cost us 50 to 100 million lives globally.  And that was with no jet planes and a global population accustomed to staying at home.

The superrich's social engineering is more serious than most imagine.  ""Contagion"" shows little bitty reflections of just how seriously we're mired into the stupidities of superrich designs.  And it gives us no discussion of the fastest, most prepared way to develop and administer effective vaccine.

We should just openly trust a film, the making of which required tens of millions of dollars?  Where did those millions of dollars come from? Ordinary Americans who are well-informed of vaccine technologies?  In your dreams.

4600942,3,B0058N2SBS,"The film ""Contagion"" plays on our media-fed fears of what might transpire during a global pandemic. The film traces the development of a mutant flu, its transmission, the response from the scientific and medical community, and possible societal consequences.

The notion of zoonotic transmission of mutant flu strain lingers lack a nagging nightmare, and global interconnectedness and rapid transit via jets (think of them as disease incubators) across sets up the perfect storm. Couple that with the almost nonexistent screening for disease at airports, docks, and border crossings, and it is clear that an infectious disease outbreak in one part of the world can rapidly spread pretty much anywhere. ""Contagion"" taps into that fear and as the film shows in some of its strongest and well-crafted sections, in just a matter of days and weeks, a global pandemic could occur.

Its initial depiction of the public health response to such an event seem realistic as epidemiologists plot the rate and route of transmission and infection, field staff try to cope with organizing a response as the health system is soon overwhelmed, and researchers beak out their microscopes and centrifuges.

But this section is also the weakest part of the film. Public health researchers would actually be swarming the labs and facilities, not working in lonely pairs. The CDC director would not be calling his from a dark, empty room like the film's staged setting. The amount of activity would make a beehive in midsummer seem relaxed, and the film flubs this portrayal.

The social and economic fabric would likely ravel to some degree, possibly as shown in the film. Desperate people would hoard food and drugs, other desperate people would loot, kill, and kidnap, and the healthy would in large measure shun the sick. Misinformation would proliferate via the Internet (e.g., the forsythia cure), and schools and workplaces would shut down. (Did anyone else keep waiting for the power to go off and wonder what Matt Damon and his daughter were finding to eat?)

In real life, military-enforced quarantines and curfews might help curtail this breakdown---or perhaps fuel it---in some areas.

I understand that movies cannot operate at the same pace as real-life, so the lack of temporal realism did not bother me that much---unlike the often pounding, jarring soundtrack that required keeping my remote available at all times.

""Contagion"" falls squarely in the middle of the pack, interesting enough, packed full of potential, but never quite good enough to trigger my ""willing suspension of disbelief.""",1331078400,,2588,5.206730769230769

There is a magic intermingling between the actors, the cinamatography, and definately the music score that leaves a deep sense of dread in the human psyche. An almost baited mixed breath of bone deep fear, shocking conclusions, and sudden need to take stock in case of the worse case scenarios as the movie unfolds, and we become aware of individuals and the huge populations of the areas where they are located. We know that what we seeing is not only possible, but by all accounts from the WHO, CDC & Prevention and most Intelligent Sectors and Concerened Goverments, this is a time bomb simply waiting to happen. As one character responds to a question concerning whether someone could weaponize the Avian Flu his answer is succinct and terrible at the same time: ""no one has to, the birds are doing it all by themselves."" We see signs of profittering, lies and misdirections by both private person,sectors and some health care monitors, and finally given some hard, cold facts concerning the science, the testing, the production and storage of a treatment protocol. A treatment protocal that will no doubt shock Educated American audiences who assume from their yearly flu shots, and the seemingly empty scares of the last swine flu outbreaks that western goverments and Health Organizations, including our own, can supply the demands for treatments in a quick and timely manner. As the movie progresses the truths of a global pandemic of any unique viral strain becomes all to depressingly shocking and terrifying.

4600945,4,B0058N2SBS,"Was it mean that I took my hypochondriac buddy to this film and now he won't leave his house? With CONTAGION, director Steven Soderbergh presents an alarmingly believable account of how a global pandemic might fall out. It's frightening how vulnerable and exposed we all are to catching a virus. The slightest contact... listen, I'm no germaphobe but I'm calling a moratorium on chest bumps with my homies.

I've always been fascinated with bio-thriller films, from 1971's The Andromeda Strain to 1995's Outbreak (Keep Case Packaging). I eat up that aspect of the science procedural. Soderbergh lifts his TRAFFIC formula and applies it to CONTAGION. We track an ensemble cast composed of A-list stars as they travel down their respective (and interconnected) story arcs. Not that the virus gives a what that these are some of Hollywood's most recognizable names. It kills all its victims impersonally. And I think that was Soderbergh's point. No one is immune (except, as it turns out, for one person).

Hong Kong has given us a wealth of classic kung fu movies. It's provided the backdrop to THE WORLD OF SUSIE WONG. Some of the tallest, most scintillating skyscrapers can be found in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is also where this supremely malevolent viral strain originates. From Hong Kong, CONTAGION follows a traveling American businesswoman (Gwyneth Paltrow) - who later the medical community would designate as ""Patient Zero"" - for as long as she's around (she's not around long), as well as the people with whom she comes into contact (they're not around for long, either). From these carriers, the disease multiplies and mutates and infects and infects and infects. In the U.S. alone, the casualties soon number in the millions.

The World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control soon deploy their brightest scientific minds (Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle, and Marion Cotillard) to backtrack the virus to its source, limit its impact, and arrive at a successful treatment protocol. Except that these doctors find themselves running into further obstacles. As with other disaster films, man's innate asshatness comes into play. Mass panic, riots, lootings, violence, politics... these are all our favorite pastimes when facing apocalypse. Soderbergh, almost with a dispassionate eye, weaves several plot threads in concert, these different perspectives coalescing into a clinical blanket study on how one uncontrollable pathogen can generate a global collapse.

It's really interesting viewing. Only, I wish it impacted the viewer on a more emotional level (and I don't mean the primal fear that this movie immediately invokes). Soderbergh keeps his characters low-key. You'd expect that from the cast of doctors and scientists, all of whom are trained to maintain a detached and analytic mindset. I will say that one of the most heartbreaking moments in this film is what happens to one dedicated epidemiologist when she catches the bug. Soderbergh is again driving home a point here. The epidemiologist's corpse is disposed of in a massive grave filled with other infected corpses. The stark anonymity of this is sobering and so sad.

Even Matt Damon's character - who as the husband of ""Patient Zero"" represents the Everyman - for the most part adheres to repressed behavior. I did like those moments in which Damon's character lets his emotions out. I wish he'd done it more. I wish that Soderbergh had done more with Damon, had played more with that one aspect which makes Damon's character unique. The most spirited (and unlikable) role goes to Jude Law who adopts a snaggletooth and plays a slimy blogging journalist. I couldn't wait for him to start coughing and sneezing...

CONTAGION is a haunting and frightening cautionary tale. It's intelligent but sterile, harrowing but on an impersonal level. I did find myself connecting to some of the characters (Damon's Mitch, Winslet's Erin Mears, Fishburne's Cheever), but only up to a point. Perhaps the images that'll stay with me are those lingering camera shots of everyday objects such as doorknobs and drinking glasses and those standup poles on the bus... How do you refrain from touching those? My buddy still won't leave his house.

4600947,4,B0058N2SBS,"As someone who studies infectious diseases like flu for a living, this movie was a long time coming. As good as Hollywood is likely to get as far as a 'realistic' portrayal of a pandemic. Certainly much more realistic than 'Outbreak'. I have minor quibbles with the rate of spread of the disease as well as the relative ease and speed with which a vaccine is developed, manufactured and used. But it's nothing like the liters and liters of antisera that Dustin Hoffman gets out of one little tiny monkey in a matter of minutes in 'Outbreak'.

Was it a possible candidate for Best Picture? No. As others have noted, the film has a decided lack of focus which makes it more difficult to care about the characters as much as you might like. In trying to portray all aspects of the pandemic, it reaches for more than it should. It might have been better served to focus on one story (ala Legend or Walking Dead) and leave the rest alone. And I don't think it would have mattered which one - Matt Damon's story was certainly foremost but the others were potentially interesting. Esp. Marion Cotillard tracking down the spread of the disease from Hong Kong and being taken hostage. As previously mentioned, the spread is too fast and the vaccine developed too fast to be entirely realistic. The speed with which time passes is also difficult to grasp and at times weeks or months appear to have passed but to the viewer it feels like hours or maybe days. And it's obvious the producers realized this and that's why they added the handy time scale in text at times although it still doesn't help with the disorientation.

Not that there aren't aspects to like. Jude Law's unscrupulous blogger hits all to close to home with today's 'blogosphere' which seems to have an 'anything goes' mentality.

Is it any good?

It's the end of the world...AGAIN! Yeah, these films have been pretty much done to death these days, but there's something about this one, which makes it feel fresh. The story follows only a few characters throughout the film, which allows us to fully understand each of their plights. Whether it's Matt Damon's character attempting to protect her daughter, or Laurence Fishburne searching for a cure, the intertwining stories are well done. The cinematography is fantastic and the lighting and composition of frames are exquisite, the work of an excellent director. The film has no action per se, the pacing kind of maintains a flat line (i.e. there's no scenes of a large virus cloud chasing Matt Damon ), but for the subject matter, it works perfectly to build suspense and draw you in.

4600962,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion is about a group of people who must deal with the spread and containment of a highly contagious disease. Based on that statement you could probably guess what might happen. Sick people, a search for the cure, and widespread panic. Contagion is exactly what you think it is. Not to say that's bad, but I was not surprised by anything I saw.

The disease starts in Hong Kong, from there it is carried by Gwyneth Paltrow back to the states where she and her son die within a day or so. Her husband Matt Damon, immune to the disease, is left to take care of himself and his daughter.

Meanwhile Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, and a few other major players are notified of numerous deaths happening around the world. The disease is spreading quickly, and the Center for Disease Control must find a vaccination and keep the public calm.

Jude Law a conspiracy blogger/journalist broke the story first. He questions if the CDC is really trying to help. He finds a medicine that he believes cures the disease, and spreads the word. As millions become affected chaos breaks out, road blocks are set up, and the people go nuts.

Soderbergh directed an all star cast. Scott Burns wrote a fairly smart script. The movie was well put together and entertaining enough, but nothing more than you'd expect. I wish Soderbergh would have gotten a little more experimental, maybe tinted the movie red or something like he did with Traffic. It seems like disease outbreak movies can go in one of two directions. An epidemic occurs and everyone turns into flesh eating zombies Aka 28 days later & I am Legend. Or an epidemic probably stemming from an animal becomes widespread, and the government works to contain the disease and the world seemingly goes insane Aka Outbreak.

I honestly felt like Contagion was too predictable and brought in tons of characters the movie couldn't devote enough time to explore. John Hawkes who I loved in Winter's Bone, plays a Janitor who shows up only once in each act of the movie, his character seemed compelling, but was pretty much wasted. The movie somewhat explored the idea that the government and CDC took care of their own before the average person. Hawkes character could have been used to show the struggles and desperation of a lower income individual taking care of his family during this epidemic.

Winslet and Cotillard were intriguing as well, but are never really explored. They came and went without us really knowing anything about them. I completely forgot about Cotillard until they mildly tie up her story near the end. I think this movie could have benefited from chopping off some of the extra meat. There were probably 7 or 8 main characters introduced, and only 2 or 3 were given the proper time to develop. Contagion tried to be this massive story about all these different people, but it just couldn't be done in 100 minutes.

For this movie to work, they were really gonna have to get us involved with these characters. So when they cry, we cry. When they are angry, we get angry, and so on. They basically just dumped on Matt Damon's character the whole movie, and by the end, sure I felt bad for him, but I wasn't really upset. His wife was cheating on him, he couldn't give his family a proper funeral, and he was stuck inside with no food protecting his daughter for months. I was more like, ""jesus christ"" cut this guy a break. You waited for some kind of reprieve, but what they gave him was pretty unsatisfying.

On the positive side, I always say if I can finish a movie in one sitting it was pretty good. And like I said the cast was impressive. Matt Damon is a great actor and he did what he could with the wiggle room he was given. He had two key emotional scenes, hearing his wife has died and dealing with it at the end, both were good. Jude Law probably had the best overall part. They flipped him around so rapidly, you're never really sure of his motives. He was probably my favorite character.

I really did like contagion, it just didn't add anything to the genre. If you're going to make a movie on a topic that's already been explored, you have to find a unique way to tell the story. This movie just rang repetition in my ears, and it'll quickly be forgotten.",1329868800,,4255,4.588157894736842
4600963,5,B0058N2SBS,"This is an excellent film and the story it relates about infectious diseases is very frightening.  The film takes us into the lives of people sick and dying from an unidentified infectious disease, the public health officials who are trying to track down the paths of contagion to find the source of the infection, the government officials trying to manage information and the responses of the public, the scientists who are trying to identify the agent and develop a vaccine, and the paranoid conspiracy crowd that muddles the picture, often for their own gain. The story begins with a bang as we see Gwyneth Paltrow travel from a business trip in Hong Kong to Minneapolis via a 5 hour overlay in Chicago and then dies a horrible death from the unknown cause. Her husband Matt Damon is then left to pick up the pieces and struggle through months of national turmoil. Parallel to all the confusion and panic, CDC scientists first try to track the source of the disease and calculate infection rates and Kate Winslet is great as a dedicated Epidemiological Investigation Service agent sent out by the CDC to find the cause of the pandemic and calculate mortality and morbidity of this unknown terror. We also see Marion Cotillard as a World Health Organization epidemiologist trying to find the vectors that transmitted the disease from some animal or plant source to humans. We also see Jennifer Ehle, a superb and often overlooked actress, who plays a CDC scientist who maps the molecular structure of the agent and begins the laborious work of developing a vaccine, including the age old technique of researchers in the last century, testing the vaccine on themselves once the crisis has reached unbearable proportions. Jennifer Ehle has many great scenes throughout the film. In once such scene she is describing the genetic structure of the unknown agent to a CDC administrator, Laurence Fishburne, and as she identifies the bat and pig virus sections in the new agent, we hear her amazement and mastery combined with her terror and apprehension. Scenes of civil breakdown with looted pharmacies, empty grocery stores, lack of any government services and protection, are all grim reminders of what could happen in such an emergency. The emergency rooms and hospitals become so filled up that the dying are laid out in gymnasiums. The morgues and funeral homes cease to function and the dead are buried in mass graves and covered by dirt by bulldozers. This is a very intelligent film that never talks down to the viewer and for the most part sticks to the facts and protocols that would be followed in such a disaster. The film is not a science fiction film in that it follows what could happen should such an agent be let loose on the human population. The acting is superb with a top cast. The script never talks down to the viewer and expects to be understood. The film is light on in-depth character development but we see folks reacting to a unique crisis.

The movie was pretty good and characters of Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) were played pretty well.

The biological sciences were accurately represented. They even tossed in a bit of alternative medicine to satisfy that audience. And, the social sciences were well represented in showing likely human responses to a sudden rapidly spreading infectious agent. Acting was superb as well as settings and props.

A serious subject that needs to be in the public forum for discussion.

4600971,2,B0058N2SBS,"The movie starts off with disease 'contagion' already in process, quickly transitioning from location to location, person to person.  The continuous thread is the CDC's effort to understand and manage. Typically, I enjoy this type of movie.  As I watched it, I couldn't put my finger on why I was not fully engaged and drawn in to the dynamics of the movie progression and the story.

I compared my memory of watching ""outbreak"", and I remembered the movie started with showing the audience the innocent mistake that caused the illness, introduced us to the source victim, and the 'realness' of the CDC workers. This caused opened three pathways for the audience experience:

1)the worry for the health of the CDC workers
2)obtain an emotional attachment to the source victim in a way that that same hope/concern could be applied to all outbreak victims, and
3)the astonishment of how a serious of innocuous events could multiply into an astounding impact.

Contagion completed this in a different order. In one way that made it very unpredictable because of the lack of foreshadowing. In another way, the same technique made it hard to follow.

There was also another plot line which dealt with the pharmaceutical beneficiary component of medicine as well as the insidiousness of opportunistic individuals during a time when humanity should be prevailing.  Though I think this is a topic worth exploring, since this was a continuous thread through a movie that I had no other true connection to good characters (because they were all introduced in pieces) to connect to their story-line, it made for a bitter taste during a confusing review.

At the end of the movie all of the pieces come together and you understand. Though the way it is done, you could almost miss the critical revelation which connects all the pieces. I watched the movie again (since I had it for a few days), it made much more sense on the second pass, you could see all the victims and how they passed it, you there was a lot more dynamic energy to it though there was still an emptiness as the only characters you could empathize with was the head of CDC and the husband who lost his wife. For me that just wasn't enough of a redeeming inspiring connection.

In the end, though I loved a lot of the lead characters, I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you are in the mood for this kind of movie, dust off OUTBREAK.",1329436800,,2390,4.725961538461538

Paltrow brings an ugly virus back to her home after spending some time in Asia. This virus has an extremely high mortality rate and has no vaccine.

With the fears surrounding Bird Flu and Swine Flu, this movie strikes a sensitive nerve. The first two-thirds of this film are fantastic. Kate Winslet is the point person in order to set up the response to the pandemic. However, once her character story leaves the film, the movie goes into a comatose-like state.

Jude Law is a blogger, with twelve million followers, who thinks the government is keeping the cure from us and pushes a homeopathic treatment.

Damon is Paltrow's husband who, someone, is immune.

4600977,4,B0058N2SBS,"I recently bought Contagion on blu-ray. Finally after getting the chance to watch it a day later, I decided to write this review while still fresh in my mind.

Contagion very vaguely reminds me of the 1996 medical thriller Outbreak. However, Contagion managed to do something Outbreak never did for me--giving me a nice feeling of suspenseful ""what's going to happen next"" dread kind of feeling. I will admit though not really a ""scary"" movie, the way everything was portrayed I found more frightening.

Comparisons aside, Contagion is a medical thriller ensemble movie starring Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Late Winslet, Matt Damon and featuring the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow. As such, the movie lacks a true central character or storyline. Instead it focuses on three: Laurence Fisburne plays Dr. Leonora Orantes, a CDC worker, Matt Damon as Mitch Ernoff, the husband of Gwynteth Paltrow's character (who is ""patient zero""), and Jude Law as a conspiracy-minded self-serving blogger.

Of the three, I enjoyed the storyline following Matt Damon's character and his daughter the most followed by Laurence Fishburne's. Truthfully I didn't care much for Jude Law's storyline. It wasn't really that it was bad or anything, I just felt it more slowed the movie down than anything. I rather would have had more focus on the medical teams trying to come up with a vaccine, Mitch and his daughter surviving as social order began breaking down around them, or even what Kate Winslet's character did while virtually held hostage in the Chinese village.

The movie follows the respective characters as they continue trying to live and work as everything begins breaking down and panic, rioting, and looting begins to break out across the United States. I thought Contagion did a great job showing the fear among the public and giving off a sense of dread.

The acting was well done and the quality on my HDTV was great so no complaints there. One of the only real complaints I had with the movie was ""Mitch's"" reaction to his wife's and six year old son's deaths. One would expect that having two loved ones die so closely with each other, much less one of which is your child, to have a huge impact on you. Instead, other than a scene or two of anger and crying (not even hard crying) he seemed to take their deaths....rather exceedingly well, actually. Just something I noticed.

I think one thing that makes this movie as creepy as it is (if such a word can be used here) is that this is the kind of movie that can actually happen exactly as shown. You don't expect to look out the window one morning to see zombies marching towards your home or a masked serial killer chasing you. But a global pandemic killing millions not only CAN happen but HAS and could very well happen AGAIN.

4600978,2,B0058N2SBS,"This movie starts interestingly enough cutting between several characters with a cool techno soundtrack. By the end it is like a big wastebasket full of virus ridden snotrags. The story goes nowhere because there is really nowhere for it to go. What suspense there is lies in seeing what characters we might mildly care about will croak from the virus. Sorry did I say ""characters,"" that's giving the movie way too much credit. This is the type of movie where the ""characterization"" consists of plugging in Hollywood stars and giving them maybe one identifying trait. Concerned dad, conflicted bureaucrat, idealistic scientist, etc. We know Jude Law is up to no good because he has crooked teeth! His character, a blogger who opportunistically profits off the disease, is the closest thing to a villain the movie has. Any criticism of the government characters comes from him and is therefore obviously not to be trusted. Why didn't they give him a hunchback while they were at it? Aside from the insinuations of the sleazy blogger we are supposed to believe the CDC is full of virtuous selfless souls who just want to sacrifice themselves to save others, and soldiers on the streets are a good thing! So when you hear about some nasty new virus don't hesitate to report to your friendly neighborhood FEMA camp for your injection like a good little piggie, er, I mean citizen!

4600982,4,B0058N2SBS,"This movie is done well. The story and plot are feasible and perhaps the realness of it makes it somewhat scary. The breakdown of society and scrapping/fighting for food and survival. The Day 1 reveal at the end was good. I was expecting something more along the lines of a remake of ""Outbreak"" with the nice little fantasy of finding the host and the cure and all ends well before it gets too awful. Obviously that is not what Contagion is all about. An outbreak in today's world and the reality of how it will hit and hit hard. That is Contagion. Even though it was not what i expected, it was still a good movie. I don't normally like ""reality"" stuff...have enough of that in my own life and don't care to watch it in movies or television...but this movie was done well and was, if not enjoyable (because of the subject matter), then mind-turning at least.",1328832000,,859,4.443037974683544
4600983,2,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion has an often used but still interesting premise, the spread of a previously unknown and deadly virus across the globe at an alarmingly rapid rate.  It also has a big name cast, including Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet, good actors who are sometimes capable of carrying a script with serious weaknesses that otherwise would be hopelessly dull or implausible.

While not heavy-laden with special effects, the ones used, especially the global graphics that display the prevalence and frighteningly likely patterns of spread of the disease, are really quite scary, and the chemical models of the virus are fascinating to behold.  It looks as if the whole world is in for tough tests of the reliability of prevailing patterns of social organization under conditions of extreme threat and the ability of modern science to quickly come up with a cure or preventive.

Predictably, rumors spread that an effective medication has been found, but that it is being hoarded by elites.  Sensationalist bloggers make the riot-provoking claim that a cure is well known and easily manufactured, but is being withheld by Big Pharma in a conspiritorial profit-couging scheme.  For a time, social chaos ensues and survivalism becomes a prevailing ethos.

None of this is new or novel, but while it lasts, it's exciting.  As the virus evolves into more lethal forms, it looks as if planet earth may have met its epidemological match.

And then everyting just sort of fizzles out.  Kind of like a guy running the 400 meters in the Olympics, burning up the track for the first 200, and then, exhausted, he just jogs the rest of the way.  Great beginning and then a good deal of disappointment.  Contagion leaves the viewer wondering, ""what's the upshot?""

I had high hopes for this movie, but ended thinking ""Huh?  That's it?""  I can't imagine what the writers were thinking.  Even actors as good as Damon, Fishburne, Law, and Winslet can't make this one satisfying.  And why was such a big deal made of Fishburne's efforts to rescue his too-young-by-half fiancee'?  To demonstrate that in-the-know-elites really were making unfair use of their advantages ... ?",1328745600,9,2176,5.0307262569832405

Very realistic worldwide response to a pandemic (very light on the sci-fi)
Very frightening (The response of people to the fear of the virus)
If you don't like Gwyneth Paltrow or Jude Law, this movie is for you
Excellent performances all around:  Matt Damon, Laurence Fishbourne, & Kate Winslet
Excellent documentary style with multi-threading stories following the outbreak of the virus
The nastiest virus I've seen on screen since ""Captain Trips"" from The Stand
Outstanding Ending!

CONs:
Not a lot of detail on any one particular character during the pandemic (the story is spread a bit thin, one star taken away)

This movie is NOT Outbreak or The Stand.  If you're wanting a character-driven drama, you probably won't like this movie.  I loved it and will put it on my yearly to see list simply because it is VERY plausable and scared the hell out of me.

[SPOILER ALERT]  There is one scene when two coroners are opening up the skull of a virus victim.  It is not extremely gory, but it's what they don't show is what haunts me.

""Contagion"" lacks any sort of a clear story line and becomes more of a playbook for the government if a virus were to spread across the country.  Every major plot point occurs extremely abruptly and when the movie is suddenly over, you'll be left with more questions than answers.

There are a lot of famous and infamous actors in this presentation for the most part we're rooting that they will make it to the end of the film. However there is the occasional character that you just waiting for him/or her to catch it.

Lots of books and lots of movies focus on the standard contagious disaster. In this one we were spared the evil done guy that doesn't listen to people or in general the defrocked scientist who turns out to be the only one that knows the true answer. Yeah there might've been a fraud tried to make a few million in the self-sacrificing individual to try to cut corners; but they are shadows of the exaggerated personalities most disaster movies.

A friend of mine mentioned it on Facebook with no comment about its value and I thought ""hm - I think I saw a link to that one on Amazon Instant Video"".

It makes a single interesting analogy between the communicability of a pathogen and that of a piece of information. This analogy fizzles to nothing, however, with nary a satisfying comment on how information can be both liberating and destructive. Further, Soderbergh's episode-like narrative ""cells"" serve only to make a boring film seem somehow longer than its 1.75 hours. That is to say that the pacing on a story like this is troublesome enough without slicing it into clips spanning a too-wide range of characters, locales; plot structures.

This is the microbe movie I have been craving all these years.  It was different from the standard Hollywood fare.  You don't have to go ""over the top"" to elicit terror - the truth is enough with this subject.

The movie is actually scientifically literate.  I watched and thought, yes, I can see that really happening - the man going into the store to find the shelves empty because no one will deliver, the people getting mad and storming MRE trucks because supplies are out, the people who simply lock their doors and disappear.  The casual amoral entrepreneur making a buck off of a marketing deception.  A kidnapping of an aid worker, which is much more common than we like to think.  There is plenty to make such subject matter interesting without stretching the truth - not even one of those improbably strange romances that often sneak into supposedly accurate movies.  Thank God.

What was interesting to me was the effort of good people to find a cure.  The loss of the innocent, those who make small mistakes, the casual transmission of the illness to people just traversing their daily chores - this is quite exciting enough, without lurid overexcesses.

I read the premise for this film, and saw that it had an all-star cast, incuding Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon. Had to be good, right?

Wrong. I don't know how this film managed to be a cliched, boring drag when the subject matter is a 1918 Spanish-flu-like virus spreading around the world. But it seems to be lacking in anything stimulating or exciting. The characters were wooden and shallow, making it difficult to care about any of them.

And the plot dragged on and on, showing scene after scene of people panicking. There was the usual conspiracy theories produced by a cliched internet blogger, the government of the United States was ineffectual and bumbling, and the government of other countries either didn't care or had no clue as to what they should do, so they did nothing.

Avoid this turkey and if you want a thrilling virus movie, find Stephen King's The Stand, which is absolutely true to his book.

4600996,5,B0058N2SBS,"`Contagion' is one of those films that continues to grow in my eyes as one of the best (in the very least, one of the most underrated) films of 2011.  Ever since first seeing it upon its release, it has only grown in esteem to me; a film that is truly inspired and original in its dissection of a global horror story.  From the film's claustrophobic cinematography to its sharply spliced editing to the perfectly timed performances that soak in the realism of every scene; `Contagion' feels like a documentary embellished with a director's visual approach.

In `Contagion', a young woman named Beth contracts what she assumes is a cold, but that cold then spreads rapidly, killing many as it overtakes the globe.  From the vantage point of the doctors striving to find a cure, `Contagion' bypasses the clich&eacute;d approach taken by most viral films (that is, merely focusing on riots in the street and social and moral decline) but giving us a fresh and intriguing look at what happens `behind the scenes'.  Soderbergh and company develop a story that screams realism, from those working for the greater good as well as those focused on stardom and or financial benefits; and it never shies away from presenting the film's `heroes' as imperfect men.

With an impressive cast (who nearly all deliver noteworthy performances), Soderbergh's `Contagion' is a magnificent thriller that sends the chills without every sacrificing the intelligence needed to make this film memorable.",1328140800,2,1479,5.040983606557377

Not the dialog, which is typical Soderberghian dead pan delivered by actors we don't care about.

And not the plot, which seems to be trying to grope his way out of darkened room without ever reaching a door.

My favorite scene is when Winslet rises during a meeting, marker in hand, to wow us with her cliched, brilliant and chilling scientific sitrep. What a joke!

The snooty, self proclaimed high IQ'd reviewers who loved this film were absolutely right. It is realistic, and just as fascinating as sitting through the typical lecture at a mediocre college classroom.

With the dense population centers around the world and transportation to all corners of the globe, if an unknown virus, as depicted in this movie, develops, it will only be by the grace of God if ANY of us survive.

""Contagion"" showed horrific scenes but it was mainly a movie about how a virus like this could suddenly appear, how easily it could spread, about how people and healthcare providers and governments would handle not only the disease but the ongoing disaster of too few caregivers, no vaccines, starvation, rioting, and fear and panic.

After the cure is found, this dull, plodding, confused-and-searching-for-meaning movie refuses to die, and continues useless scene after USELESS scene, as one imagines Soderburg and the screenwriter sitting around saying, ""what should we add now?""
With MILLIONS dead, there's some confusing issue about states that are about to refuse to let people in or out (regardless of where they are living?)- so Lawrence Fishburne (who mails it in, never changing his expression the entire movie) 'breaks the rules' - and tells his fiancee to leave Chicago before this starts. This ridiculous bit of Jaywalking-as-crime is put up as some kind of 'terrible thing.' Were the writers drugged?

What was seriously overlooked (or worse: tolerated) was the anti-semitism involved with this arab financing (Production financing money from Abu Dhabi): While Abu Dhabbi and Cairo are mentioned (laughably) for their 'scientific input,' the entire country of Israel is not shown on any maps, nor is it mentioned. What's up with that, Mr. Soderburgh? Did ya get a push for that Jew-hatred from your friends in the White House?

Another piece of ignorance was a brief scene where a janitor asks Fishburne about treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder for his son. Instead of actually USING HIS POSITION as filmaker to raise public awareness about the DANGERS of Big Pharma pushing these dangerous drugs, this is given a pass by these cowardly stooges for the worst in our culture.

An interesting plot turn that could have actually brought some drama to the movie was Paltrow's adultery - which is so ignored u wonder why it was brought up in the first place, and the kidnapped doctor who runs back to the village after finding out about the 'medicine'. Instead, there are scenes created to carry the picture forward - especially after the cure; and you wonder - towards what end???

I had high hopes, but somewhere, either in the writing or directing, someone failed to sufficiently develop the plot line. The viewer is left feeling like they missed a good hour of the movie (it's very short).",1327276800,,318,4.5
4601018,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion is a movie about the spread of a disease and how easy it is to contract it.

Gywneth Paltrow is the instigator. From there it just spreads and spreads...and spreads. I always knew Gwyneth Paltrow would be the death of this world.

In all honesty though, this film is terrifying but it just moves too fast. You don't really get what's going on until the disease has already claimed lives. That's not to say that the film doesn't have some solid story telling. It does. Contagion follows the lives of five different people. Matt Damon knows about the disease more than most because it claimed the life of not only his wife (Paltrow), but his son as well. From there we see him coping with that, and trying to protect his daughter from falling victim as well. Kate Winslet is the person put in charge of containing and combating the virus, even trying to find the source. Her boss, Laurence Fishburne, is the head of the CDC, so not only is he having to explain to the populace about what's happening, but he's also doing what he can to keep his lover safe. Jude Law is the arrogant blogger hellbent on outing CDC for all the wrong they've done in reaction to dealing with this disease. And finally, the beautiful Marion Cotillard is sent to find find the origin. Once she does, she is subjected to a kidnapping of sorts.

So, the director has a lot of story to tell in a slim 106 minutes. He does a respectible job, but some characters don't feel very fleshed out. Well...scratch that, none feel very real. I understand the primary story is about how the world dealt with the quick spread of this very dangerous disease. Yet, the story of the disease centers around the reaction of these five characters. Matt Damon, for instance, lost his wife and son, and on top of that found out she was rearranging her schedule to meet up with another man and cheat on him. Yet, we never see him truly deal with those facts.

Don't get me wrong, Contagion is a frightening, unnerving movie dealing with a very real threat. But, the resolution just kind of happens and then it ends. That's where my problem is. The acting is superb, but there's no real script to speak of. Recommended viewing? Yes. Essential viewing?

Hucksters, promoting miracle cures take advantage of the situation to hawk miracle cures with zero effectiveness. The story follows different characters as they follow different paths to the end goal- finding an antidote.

While I did find the story enjoyable, I did think they could've handled certain elements better. For instance, I suspect that the doctor who 'notified' his wife prior to the outbreak, would've had his wife already in a protected area. Scientists can't really be expected to work effectively if their loved ones are running around inside known areas about to be quarantined. Second, I am not sure how it really helped to paint patient zero as an adulterous white woman having an illicit affair when she contracts the illness. It just gives the contagion a judgemental quality which I didn't like. Would she never have gotten the disease had she not insisted on having a photo taken with the chef who didn't wash his hands after chopping pig parts? Is this the fate of all evil cheating women?

Overall, I did like the film. I like disaster films as a whole, and this one was handled well, and was full of characters I could relate to.",1326931200,2,1455,4.792828685258964

4601027,3,B0058N2SBS,"With the immediate subject matter of a global pandemic Steven Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" shows us how the world as we know it slowly disintegrates into chaos, and the people struggling to cope with and survive the situation. The script (penned by Scott Z. Burns, Soderbergh's ""Informant"") is obviously written with the recent SARS epidemic in mind, and the film offers a more frightening look at the crisis caused by a lethal virus than ""Outbreak"" does, but its intriguing premise is bogged down by some weak writing that could have been remedied.

The medical thriller has an impressive ensemble cast including Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Jennifer Ehle, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet. While doctors and researchers of the world (represented by characters by Cotillard, Ehle, Fishburne and Winslet) attempt to identify the cause of the widespread disease and search for the cure, Jude Law's blogger claims his own theory that attracts many online. Meanwhile, the story of Mitch and Beth Emhoff (Damon and Paltrow), married couple with two children, follows the panic among the ordinary people seen from an ordinary family.

While the director's detached approach to the characters helps create the film's grim and realistic touch, the familiar faces of the stars keep reminding us that we are watching a movie. ""Contagion"" gives us chilling scenario of the society struck by the deadly virus, and how fear throws people headlong into confusion, but the realism is often undermined by the melodramatic storyline (Cotillard's character in particular) and some turn of events that seem too good to be true.

Thus, like in his ""Informant,"" Soderbergh employs styles that are curiously at odds with the contents. For all its excellent acting from the entire cast and some credible moments of the global pandemic, ""Contagion"" lacks power that would make us really worried about the future.",1326931200,,1916,5.254901960784314

The Stand was basically a story of the aftermath of a deadly virus outbreak that wipes out most of civilization, and how the survivors...well...survive. Contagion is not that.

Looking for a movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;that's basically a story of the aftermath of a deadly virus outbreak that wipes out most of civilization AND turns its victims into zombie-like madmen? Contagion is not that either.

Looking for CSI: Virus Outbreak? Contagion is that. Contagion is packed with stars who play very relatively small parts and take a back seat to Laurence Fishburne who essentially takes his old CSI: Las Vegas character and applies it to this movie. And the movie is mostly about finding out where the disease came from and finding a vaccination/cure. The acting is all done well, and Director Steven Soderbergh creates some realistic and genuinely unsettling moments in the movie. Man, if you weren't a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purell/dp/B002XIXJOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purell</a>&nbsp;user prior to seeing this you will be after!

So what's scarier and more enjoyable to watch?...The realistic depiction of a virus mutating and potentially dooming civilization as we know it or the notion of, I don't know, say some unknown outbreak causing people to mutate dooming civilization as we know it?

Perhaps his disenchantment with the performance of his political Demi-God, Obama has warped his ability to choose decent roles to participate with. Who knows?

They are never realistic, and usually have long shot, unbelievable characters who survive against all odds, or get sick and are cured in the nick of time, or who have heroes who are never effect and main characters who never get sick. Not this movie. I found the scenario realistic, the characters believable, no one was perfect, even the good guys. There are several big name actors, and not all of them are safe, or squeaky clean.

I watched this movie because it came highly recommended by some medical professional family members. I was skeptical because of all the negative reviews saying it was boring and unrealistic and depressing. I found this movie was absolutely none of these things. I will say if you require a movie to be shoot-em-up robots or man eating aliens every five seconds to be enjoyable, this is not your movie.

However, the movie did a decent job of portraying the desperation that would naturally accompany this kind of epidemic.  The characters were very real and the situations were very authentic.  It is easy to understand how people would behave given the threat of a disease like this. From leaking information to loved ones but withholding that information from the general public to testing a vaccine on yourself without approval.

I was hesitant due to the mixed reviews, however I was astounded by the perfectly flawless video and audio quality of the Blu-ray, and the well crafted story which quite quick and raw unfolds in Contagion. There is not a huge amount of character development as the movie jumps right into the horror of a virus which starts dropping people like flies in a very short amount of time.

The movie is very entertaining and brings up a lot of personal questions. What would you do? How would you act? Would you have done this or that? I love movies like this which are not only meant to entertain, but also to educate and possibly prepare you for a similar situation. I never really doubted the film. I think a lot of people didn't believe it, especially how the government would react. I for one must state that this is how the people and how the government would react to such a threat to America as well as the rest of the world. It is very interesting how it spreads and don't worry, throughout the film you will pick up more bits of information regarding how this all started. You must watch this until the very end. Don't get bored and turn it off as you are greatly missing the message and story of this scary tale.

I actually liked this movie despite the fact that it didn't deal with a personal core story as much as fit was a story about how rapidly really bad diseases spread. It reminded me of one of my kids early books called Gossip. The moral in that book is that a little bird tells a larger member of the animal chain something and the information passed from animal to animal gets larger and changes until it is off the charts.
What the viewer sees here is akin to the process of something getting spread around. The disease starts out as a sneaky and inexplicable malady that kills and when it picks up momentum, it becomes a race to identify its source and come up with an antidote and manage its spread.
Without much more than the slightest thread that links people to one another and make the viewer feel an emotional investment, it still manages to get the viewer squirming. I'm dealing with a cold right now and I felt myself feeling sicker as I watched this on a cushy couch in the family room. Talk about the power of suggestion or am I a closet hypochondriac? Watching the people from the CDC added to the suspense as well as my anxiety.
The acting was good as was the script. Though not a weeper, this movie was effective and good. I enjoyed it, it presented me with things to consider given the current political climate, and I did feel better once things got under control in no small part due to the unrelenting efforts by the CDC.

Within a few days the mystery virus has struck down tens of thousands more and the world is looking at a rerun of the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, only much worse. There is no known cure. Social order starts to break down and looters rip through stores, looking for food, water and a homeopathic medicine they think might save them. This is where we are half an hour into Contagion and the director hasn't missed a beat. We're gripped. What could go wrong next? What calamities await? Unfortunately, the film starts spinning out of control at this point, and by the end has turned into a shapeless mess which we don't care about. One reason is a sure-footed script that stumbles badly, another is a cast of characters we don't care about (they keep dying off), while another is the irritating fact that the director is trying to cram too much in. He wants to show us what happens, as well as what might happen, plus the personal conflict the (two-dimensional) characters are experiencing, plus what the long-term implications are, and let's not forget the protesters who are furious at what they see as official inaction and incompetence, and we have to find space for the so-called independent journalist-cum-blogger who casts doubt on the authorities' attempts to find a cure while peddling the homeopathic cure and hang on, is he independent, or is he shilling for a firm and making big bucks out of it? Let's also not forget the lone father trying to keep his teen daughter away from her possibly infected boyfriend.

4601047,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich, The Limey) and written by Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!), is something of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a highly interesting film about the outbreak of a global pandemic and how various organizations and individuals respond to it. It has an all-star cast of highly talented actors, it's well researched and intelligently written, and the director manages to follow all of the interweaving sub-stories fairly smoothly. But all of that said, I found that in the end, except for the odd bit here and there, I was never emotionally engaged by it. Which, when you remember that you're witnessing the deaths of about half of the characters you see on the screen, is a strong indication that something important is missing.

The best part of the film is in the two opening sequences. In the first sequence, with no real dialogue to speak of, we see a stream of images, of people touching things, of other people then touching those things, then touching themselves, then touching other people, the camera following contact to contact as the viewer is wordlessly shown just how fast and how wide a virus or bacterium could potentially spread. Then, in the second sequence, the story actually begins on Day Two of the outbreak, and we are shown three individuals - a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) on a plane coming back to Minnesota from a trip, a young Chinese man (Tien You Chui) in Hong Kong going home from work, and a Japanese businessman (Yoshiaki Kobayashi) on a commuter train in Tokyo - all of whom are all coming down with something. And from these three people, the pandemic proceeds to spread. The real thing that makes the viewer stay to the end is the final revelation of the mystery: just where did the virus come from and how were these disparate individuals linked together. Soderbergh accomplishes this in a clever way which, looking back, should have been obvious from the beginning. He starts the story at Day Two, but only at the end does he take us back to Day One where all of the clues we are shown along the way are finally tied together.

On a technical level, Contagion is praiseworthy for grounding its medical and biological aspects firmly in actual science and in portraying the various government and international health organizations realistically in terms of how they actually respond to infectious outbreaks. And Contagion is also commendable for showing that not everything goes smoothly, that even in the face of a lethal epidemic, overlapping agencies can be fractious over matters of administrative turf and budget, that commercial considerations can delay critically-needed actions, and that some individuals will take advantage of privilege and power to protect themselves at the expense of others.

But for all of its technical accuracy and the clarity of its presentation, Contagion never seems to really connect emotionally. Part of the reason for this failure to connect on an emotional level is that there really are no surprises. Almost every clich that tends to pop up in this genre shows up here. The doctor who uses herself as a guinea pig to test the vaccine. The health official who violates ethics by calling to warn his wife to get out of the city before a quarantine is ordered, who in turn ends up telling other people. The scientist who goes against orders and comes up with a vitally needed discovery. The riots that ensue when a pharmacy runs out of a medication. Social order breaking down. About every other character dying at some point. And finally, a cure is found and the world is saved. The end.

The other part of why Contagion fails to connect is that, in attempting for a global scope, it spreads itself too thin where its characters are concerned. The ensemble cast is impressive. Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff, the first victim we see succumb to the virus. Matt Damon as Mitch, her husband, does a creditable job as a man who struggles to cope with the fact that his wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well. Other myriad roles are filled by high caliber actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, Chin Han and others. There's also a cameo with TV's ubiquitous health authority Dr. Sanjay Gupta as himself. But all of that acting power ends up largely being wasted because the individual characters are limited in their screen time and character development often ends up being sacrificed to the needs of the plot. Damon, with Anna Jacoby-Heron as his teen-aged daughter, Jory, gets more screen time than most as the film tries to show what ordinary people would be experiencing in this situation, but again the lack of surprises and the been-there-seen-that feel of their scenes works against him.

Two particular performances however are worth pointing out. Elliot Gould does a low key but perfect turn as Dr. Ian Sussman, a research scientist who decides to follow his instincts and goes against orders to destroy his samples, resulting in a key breakthrough. In a brief but touching scene, Gould conveys Sussman's weighing the difficulty of his decision just through his facial expression and body language, a masterful performance by a highly underrated actor. And Jude Law's less than scrupulous freelance blog-journalist Alan Krumwiede (a perfect name for his low-life character) fills the role of the film's only real human villain. A brief scene between the two gives the film its best single line: ""Blogging isn't writing,"" an exasperated Gould vents at Law, who's been pestering him for information. ""It's graffiti with punctuation!"" And in another scene with a pharmaceutical rep, Law gets in the film's other memorable line: ""It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.""

All in all, Contagion isn't a bad film. It is interesting if you want a believable and fairly accurate portrayal of just how this scenario would likely unfold. But the human element is largely lost in the mix, which robs the film of the emotional impact you instinctively feel a film of this sort should have. Recommended, but adjust your expectations accordingly.",1326585600,5,6267,4.8964218455743875

  Beth Emhoff (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) returns home from a business trip to Hong Kong with symptoms of what appears to be a minor illness until her husband Mitch (played by Matt Damon) finds her on the kitchen floor having a seizure. The doctors are dumbfounded as the disease manages to spread not only in the Emhoffs' hometown of Minneapolis but also in other communities across the U.S. and the globe. The resulting fears are then stoked by a conspiracy-minded blogger named Alan Krunweide (played by Jude Law) who sees the disease as an attempt to further trim the civil liberties of ordinary citizens while drug companies and medical professionals rake in untold profits. All while actual medical professionals (played by Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard and others) continue to work tirelessly and gain little, if any, advantage in the fight.

  As already mentioned, this is a very impressive cast. The individual stories tug at the sympathies of every viewer while the overall narrative is chilling to both germaphobes and those with anti-government leanings.

4601058,4,B0058N2SBS,"I really do not think that this is movie for everyone. It is slow building, not very action packed, and sometimes very predictable.  The suspense I felt while watching this movie was less about the suspense in the movie and more concerning the possibility and reality that something like this could actually happen and has happened in the past.  However, despite these short-comings, I did find the movie enjoyable.  The social discord that occurred as a result of the outbreak is always interesting to see.  In the end, it is a thought provoking movie, which I tend to enjoy.
Some complaints about the movie is that it seems to be pandering to the pharmaceutical companies. However, I didn't really see this because at the end of the day while inoculations are important not everything can be cured by drugs.  The message I got from the movie was more concerning personal hygiene.  A lot of illness can easily spread from the practice of poor hygiene (i.e. not washing your hands, coughing/sneezing into your hands, or constant touching of your face).  I left the movie counting how many times I touched my face before I got home instead of wanting to get an inoculation.

It felt to me like there was a lot of filler time. Maybe it is the director trying to build suspense by staying on a scene for so long but it was a fail in my mind. I guess my medical background had something to do with me and my girlfriend finding this movie less than remarkable, intense, or chilling. My biggest hope from this movie, as it shows how easy something can get passed between people was that, after seeing it, people would be more hygienic. However, people are as gross as always. I work security and watch people all day long sneeze or cough in their hands (or even pick their nose) then proceed to touch everything they can. People are so gross and inconsiderate!

Unfortunately, the personal storylines aren't fully developed enough to warrant involvement.  Many questions are left unanswered and two of the movie's name stars die rather quickly, although Gwyneth Paltrow's demise is fully explained by the film's finale.  Most of the performances are effective---Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jude Law---but I felt Marion Cotillard gave little to her role.

I think I only felt somewhat sympathetic towards Laurence Fishburne's character. I also didn't even really feel much about the outbreak itself. Yes, its a big deal when millions die, but this was a movie, and in the movie it felt like I kept waiting for a climax only to find the movie suddenly at an end. You really felt like this was all leading to something truly horrific, or that humanity would nearly wipe itself out, and then it was over.

4601072,2,B0058N2SBS,"If sex sells, the only thing that sells more is impending disaster. Global epidemics are certainly not new in movies, but this is Soderbergh's take on it, and if that's not enough, the ensemble cast assembled in Contagion is the Hollywood equivalent to the Miami Heat and Philadelphia Eagles stacking their respective rosters. If you're into global panic, virus dissemination, or just simply looking for justification for your purchase of a 64oz twin pack of Purell from Costco, then this movie is worth checking out. For everyone else, Contagion is a mosaic of somewhat compelling stories but none of which are fully realized.

The film follows a myriad of individuals who are husbands, doctors, researchers, Internet bloggers, and government officials spanning continents around the world dealing with a deadly transmitted virus that kills those who contract it within days. Through different perspectives and story arcs, the film spans nearly half a year as the origins of the virus are discovered and the subsequent scramble to produce an antidote.

Contagion is not a bad film, it is quite compelling and, compared to other films about global peril, believable. The cast includes a number of academy award winners and nominees including Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Marion Cotillard. The problem is, none of these characters are offered enough screen time to fully flesh out their unique story. It is a bold and ambitious undertaking, as each story line is vastly distinct from one another but by the time you finish whispering ""I didn't know he/she was in this movie!"" to your neighbor, the perspective changes and that person disappears. The pacing is necessarily brisk, and the story telling is potent, but because of the constant roulette of scenarios, there is a certain detachment from the story. We hop from one continent to another, spanning the United States, China, and Switzerland, but not once do you feel like the setting is anything more than a backdrop. They all become a blur and out of focus reminiscent of a view from a moving carousel.

The performances range from adequate to great, though you're never really sure which since most characters bounce from one scene onto another then suddenly into oblivion before their role ever takes off. By the time things wrap up, so many questions remain that you forget to ask because you simply can't keep track of all the characters. The film would have benefited from trimming down all the branches and focusing on a select few. Some notable examples are the husband who is immune, an Internet blogger uncovering or creating a conspiracy, and a researcher desperate for a cure.

Soderbergh voraciously pieces together a story that is larger than the collective whole. The film becomes a haunting study about the desperation of a population in the face of forthcoming doom. While the rotating perspectives helps to keep you engaged throughout the film, it also serves to strip away any tension and attachment you might otherwise have for any of the characters. It is a shame because a few of the intertwining stories could have been a film unto itself.

4601081,1,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion is boring at best, and confusing if you can keep your eyes open long enough to search for the storyline.  My guess is that Soderbergh, Damon and Paltrow where betting on a really nasty flu season and planned to ride the wave of people's anxiety and discomfort to sell tickets.  With millions of good stories available, the only reason (aside from money) the Hollywood-Left makes a movie like this is to advance their fantasy that mere humans cannot exist without governments.  And, if you are a real far-Left One-World zealot, a single global government; NGOs as heroes is the top of their hot list.

The United States has some wonderful people fighting and living heroic lives in Afghanistan, at the border with Mexico, and even inside America cities saving lives and property.  Is Soderbergh interested it their story -- nooooo.  Why?  Because people like Soderbergh hate real heroes, both past and present; and, they will be damned if there are any more American heroes in the future.

In any case, Contagion stinks.  It is not interesting or entertainment and as a result the real nightmare scenario of viral epidemics will go without discussion.  I suggest Michael Crichton's ""Andromeda Strain"" (the movie is good, the book is excellent) or if you are into film noir, the 1950 film ""Panic in the Streets"" (and if you think I simply dislike left-leaning people, note that the director is Elia Kazan).",1325980800,2,1414,4.9033613445378155
4601082,5,B0058N2SBS,"Honestly, I feel like Director Soderberg borrowed quite a bit from the 1971 version of 'The Andromeda Strain'.

But that's not a knock. He took the best elements and creatively expanded on every level and every aspect. From the synth/electro soundtrack to the medically accurate plot, from the documentary-esque cinematography to the governmental reaction - he developed a vastly updated story for our times. I suspect Michael Crichton would be so proud.

It doesn't take fear mongering to recognize Truth. And humans, who are forever cursed with a single lifetime of memory, are not prepared for a true global pandemic. The truth is - we never will be.

I'll give you a real-life situation. As I write this it's January 5, 2012. One of the big local stories here is the closing of two hospitals. One of which serves a large portion of our island community. Its sister operation was the only certified transplant center for the state - currently, there isn't any place to do transplants of any kind short of flying six or seven hours to the continental US.

However, that's not the 'big' news. It's this: Already the emergency rooms of every single hospital on this island is overwhelmed. There are now seventeen stories that has made national news which detail the problem. There are too many emergencies for the the entire ER system to accommodate. All because two hospitals closed down. Keep in mind, there's nothing ""happening"" now. What the system is experiencing is simple overload, nothing more, nothing less. Just the day-to-day general crises one faces for a population of 900,000 people.

So, the question is: What would happen during a biological crisis as was depicted in the film when up to 30% of the population could be incapacitated and the rest ruthlessly desperate for medical help? Can you imagine it? What would the medical community do?

I can guarantee several things the film accurately depicts. Here's one: The nurses union would strike. I'm certain they'll find some coldly logical and totally legal reason, but fear is what will be driving their desire to not go to work. It happened before - during the initial days of the AIDS Crisis. No doubt there'll be heroes who step up, but the majority will quietly (and readily) accept their union position. What is a nurses strike going to do the medical system? Can you imagine?

And the problems are just starting. I won't even get into how little food is actually in the pipeline for large metropolitan cities. Especially large cities that are entirely dependent on a majority of food being imported to its populace.

Given the way our lives are now completely interconnected, and in so many ways dependent, on one another - from food to commerce - the concept of a ""plan of action"" is quite honestly a self-delusion at best and at worst - a lie. A lie that is told to us because we need that semblance of control. When the next sickness comes, anyone not living completely off the grid with absolutely no other human contact, will be negatively affected - one way or another.

'Contagion' delivers a true picture of a disease and its life as it interdicts with our own. Terrifyingly scary - yes. But I'm grateful to Director Soderberg for spreading, no pun intended, the message. Sadly, entertainment seems to be the only proven methodology for this kind of knowledge to reach the masses. Can it help? Don't know. But it can't hurt.

And I hope that mocking people as ""germaphobes"" - another form of self-delusion - ends with this film. Get a clue, shut up, and repeatedly wash your hands. Cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing - and then wash your hands. Don't rub your eyes with your fingers - and wash your hands again. Stay home if you're sick. And wash your hands again.

Outstanding film. Watch it - remember - and learn.

Personal Note: I broke my own rule and started to read other reviews before posting my own. There's a reviewer who goes by 'Rachel' - who succinctly describes the type of human who lives within his/her own lifetime of memory. Pathetic conspiracy nut, and honestly, kinda scary.

Ironically, the slimy narcissist played by Jude Law, the so-called blogging ""journalist"", is her representation in the film.

Again, The Truth.

It had a lot of big name actors, but all of them played very realistic characters that weren't completely 'clean.' Stellar performance by everyone involved.

This movie describes the rapid global spread of a new virus which ends up killing 26 million people.  The CDC, WHO, and other government agencies are actively trying to find a cure, or more specifically a vaccine to combat the aggressive new virus.  This movie has an all-star ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Lawrence Fishburne, Jude Law, Elliot Gould and others.  (NOTE:  Damon and Paltrow had smaller roles that I thought they would.)  The immediate breakdown of society due to panic over the virus and subsequent limited vaccine supply was disturbing.  It was a reminder how quickly we can lose our humanity in times of desperation.  I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys conspiracy theory (Jude Law story line) and thought-provoking plots.",1325808000,5,968,5.075949367088608
4601089,4,B0058N2SBS,"It's very difficult to create an effective, engaging and good drama about a disease. ""Outbreak"" is an example of what can go wrong with these type of films. Steven Soderbergh does a really good job of introducing a wide variety of characters (casting well known actors helps us to keep track of who's who)into a story that takes place on a global scale but still impacts humanity on a small, local level.

The script by Scott Burns nicely sketches in even minor characters and casting the roles with well known actors helps to bring additional depth to the characters in a largely incident driven script.

""Contagion"" provides us with a much more realistic presentation on how medicine and science do battle with a deadly virus that suddenly comes to the forefront. A team of scientists (Kate Winslet, Marion Cottlard, Elliot Gould, Jennifer Ehle)try and crack the genetic code for this virus in a dramatic effort to save lives as pressure is applied to the head of the CDC (Lawrence Fishburne)to come up with a workable vaccine as it becomes clear how deadly the disease becomes. The introduction of the subplot involving a blogger (nicely played by Jude Law)
advocating the use of a natural herb and his belief that the government and big Pharma are suppressing the information adds suspense to the story and provides a nice contrast to the main story.

The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good with a sharp presentation with nice skin tones. Black levels and contrast are quite nice. This is an exceptionally nice looking high definition transfer.

Audio moves from little to high activity within one scene to the next depending on if the scene is more dialogue or action driven.

The special features are quite good as well if a bit on the meager side. We get an 11 minute featurette on the reality of ""Contagion"" where prominent scientists discuss the reality of what we see. ""The Contagion Detectives"" runs a brief 5 minutes focusing on those who decode the DNA of these often lethal virus and help figure out a plan of attack for developing a vaccine or disabling the virus. We get a 2 minute PSA and a DVD edition (for the 2 disc edition)of the movie and the dreaded Ultraviolet streaming option as well.

Although the film would probably have worked better as a mini-series allowing us to see more detailed, developed characters, ""Contagion"" still manages to be a suspensful ride that shows how a virus can decimate humanity with relative ease in our globe trotting world and how myth/rumor can easily spread like a virus on the internet (and lethal in its own way)that can impact our decisions.

It addresses the etiology of contagious diseases, how they begin, how they are introduced in to the world population, how they can be viewed as instances of germ warfare, how they are examined by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, how they are disseminated, the processes required for creating a vaccine, how the treatments are managed, how individuals are affected both directly and indirectly, who decides the priorities of treating large number of people around the globe, and how in the face of a world crisis certain evil people can take advantage of the fear and make millions off unsuspecting terrified people.

Interestingly the film begins with the marker 'Day 2' and the significance of that move is held until the film's satisfying end. Beth Emhoff (Gweneth Paltrow) is returning home form a business trip in Hong Kong, has a layover in Chicago where she calls her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) informing him of the delay. She arrives home ill and son is dead form a seizure disorder brought on by encephalitis - and infection of unknown type that has spread to her brain.

The World Heath Organization represented by Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) becomes involved as the point of origin of the disease seems to be Hong Kong: her attempt to help the Chinese is at first assisted by young Sun Feng (Chin Han) until the Chinese forces decide to hold her hostage until the vaccine can be sent to save a province in China. As the contagious disease is studied, identified, and a vaccine becomes available some smarmy people such as 'journalist' Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) goes on the internet blogging the use of forsythia as the cure, bilking millions of dollars around the world for his fake cure. The story is both catastrophic and immediate as Soderbergh intentionally develops personal stories to demonstrate how a severe contagious disease can impact both throngs of peoples and individuals as well.

The supporting cast is filled with fine actors and the momentum of the story is almost intolerable fast.

I am pretty sure that what I viewed about the politics within the world's governments and the health departments was right on target.

4601096,4,B0058N2SBS,"The movie opens in an airport lounge where an obviously ill Beth Emhoff, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is on the phone with her husband Mitch, played by Matt Damon.  Somewhere in the world the wrong pig met the wrong bat and a new, highly contagious strain of deadly virus was born.  Unknowingly, Beth is its first victim, infected while on a business trip.  Within hours of her arrival home in Minneapolis, people who came into contact with her are either dead or dying and thousands of others around the world have become infected.  Samples have been collected and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization whose job it is to figure out what in the world is happening.

The world is unprepared for this lethal virus.  By day 18, the severity of the outbreak is clear and the social structure starts to deteriorate.  Cities are quarantined, curfews imposed, the dead are buried in mass graves, food is in short supply, and riots erupt.  With no vaccine and no protection and a 25% mortality rate, the scenario is definitely worst case.  Laurence Fishburne plays Dr. Ellis Cheever, the presiding CDC official everyone turns to for reassurance and answers.

We've seen similar scenarios many times on film but not quite in this way.  In ""Contagion,"" the science takes center stage.  The science is spot on, it's as real as it gets, and the scientists and researchers are portrayed as the heroes they really are.  The movie accurately portrays how they do their jobs, how passionate they are, how they personally react to a scary situation and how extraordinarily tough and dangerous the work is.  The pressure is intense.  The truth is scary.  From all the experts, it's all a matter of when, not if.

How do the people involved in disease investigations mitigate the damage as quickly as possible?  How do they communicate the threat without causing fear and panic?  How much information is the public entitled to know?  How do they handle misconceptions and disinformation which can spread like a disease on the web? As Dr. Sanjay Gupta puts it in the bonus section, ""information itself is a transmissible disease.  It can cause a lot of damage.  It spreads very, very quickly and in some cases people can die from it.""

With a short incubation period, the highly contagious strain raises the CDC's concern readily ensued by the panic of the masses. The medical community scrambles in a losing race against time as the numbers of infected and dead patients grow at a staggering pace. Controversy, capitalism, distrust...all are likely products of slowly-solved epidemics.

The cast flawlessly conveys the very best and worst of human qualities responding to a deteriorating society and economy.

4601106,4,B0058N2SBS,"Steven Soderbergh has amassed an interesting body of films, from sheer popcorn entertainment (the first OCEAN'S 11 movie), to the art-house fare (CHE), to the offbeat (THE INFORMANT!), to the Oscar-worthy (TRAFFIC), to the crappy (the second and third OCEAN'S films).  I broke this down as much as I did to get across a specific point: Steven Soderbergh knows how to make a movie, and not only that, he knows how to make movies HIS way.

CONTAGION is proof.  It's a solidly-crafted film revolving based on a Scott Z. Burns (THE INFORMANT!, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM) script.  The film follows various individuals amidst a pandemic: a grieving father/husband; a group of research scientists; an investigator; a conspiracy blogger; and the virus itself, as it passes from person-to-person.  Soderbergh again collects an impressive cast: Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, John Hawkes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Elliot Gould, Dmetri Martin, Sanaa Lathan, and others.  Standouts include Matt Damon, as the afore-mentioned father; Winslet as a field-researcher; Fishburne and Ehle as her colleagues; and Gould in a criminally-small role as another researcher.  Other actors are wasted in thankless, meaningless roles and subplots (Cotillard, Law).

This latter flaw is what really holds the film back.  As with all massive ensemble films, it's easy to get things tangled, to add to much fuel to the fire.  Soderbergh, usually capable of juggling his casts, seems to lose track; certain story lines are left unfinished (and not in the good, ambiguous sort of way), and other story lines are utterly unnecessary.  If the film had focused more on its heart (Damon) and science (Winslet and Fishburne), or even its politics (Cranston), it would have been much more stable.  As is, it's riddled with holes.  This won't stop your enjoyment of the film (note the four stars), but it does make us wonder what this film could have truly been, were its script honed a little finer, and it's director not quite as ambitious.",1325548800,3,2064,5.180722891566265
4601107,4,B0058N2SBS,"An alarming portrayal of a viral outbreak and its fallout Contagion is essentially a real life horror story - one that very well could prompt concern of a scenario that is unfortunately not far fetched. A fast spreading disease appears out of no where making its way through the population and the movie follows a handful of characters and their different perspectives and circumstances.

Expertly orchestrated by director Steven Soderbergh Contagion feels a lot like like an independent film - from the tone to its pacing, imagery, and score. It has those qualities but is littered by a number of recognizable and respected stars in the cast. Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Lawrence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, and Bryan Cranston share the primary screen time. Their characters are all tied together through the world event but are fractured into their own angles.

One man has lost loved ones and hangs on to only person he has left (his daughter), the CDC is working on tracking down the origin of the virus and finding a solution, an investigative blogger is seeking out a scoop and championing a conspiracy theory, and a doctor is sent to Hong Kong to try and locate the original source of the virus. This is all happening as the public reacts and the situation escalates. While the factions don't completely merge framing them in this manner establishes the necessary scope of the ordeal.

The audience at the packed screening seemed to struggle with processing what was taking place. At times there were audible gasps and on several occasions nervous laughter. As the credits rolled there was a smattering of applause and also heavy chatter. It's a movie that challenges the viewer and is striking in its effectiveness. There is also some very graphic imagery and some disturbing happenings that take place which are unexpected in how they are presented - some of it even caught me off guard to an extent. You'd be hard pressed to find a single up-beat moment in the entire movie.

That is likely to result in mixed viewer response. The immediate feeling I have is there will be those who think the movie is excellent and others who find it boring due to a lack of action and its calculated though consistent pace. It is suspenseful in its overwhelming sense of dread and that won't be considered enjoyable for everyone.

The conclusion to the film is where it lost me somewhat as it felt rushed and a bit convenient - which was out of place considering everything that had taken place before it.

Instead it took the opportunity to answer a lingering question which didn't feel as though it was ultimately necessary.

4601110,4,B0058N2SBS,"""Contagion""  is a stark, realistic look at what happens when a new killer virus is discovered and the worldwide health and medical community rush to combat the disease before it takes an incomprehensible toll on human life.  Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) has just welcomed his wife, Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow), back from a business trip to Hong Kong.  She's feverish and weak, but these symptoms of flu turn out to signal something far more dangerous.

Other victims of this unknown affliction surface, word spreads, and Drs. Ellis Cheaver (Laurence Fishburne) and Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control brainstorm to figure out the source of the virus.  Mears is hastily sent into the field to gather information while other researchers amp up their efforts to isolate the virus and develop a vaccine.  Among them are independent biologist Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) and CDC Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle).

""Contagion"" provides a credible look at what might happen if such a health threat came to pass, and has an almost documentary feel as multiple aspects of the story unfold in parallel time while locations shift from city to city, country to country.  Characters are well drawn; real people act heroically without making a big deal of it.  Yet despite its fine performances, the movie plays on a single emotional and dramatic note.  It moves along, unhurried and deliberate, as director Steven Soderbergh portrays a tense but generally disciplined populace.

""Contagion"" provides a thoughtful spin on the Hollywood disaster flm.  Though the formula is borrowed from many 70's blockbusters, ""Contagion"" is far more reflective.  The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains a Digital Copy, a mini-documentary of how a virus changes the world, and two featurettes.

4601117,5,B0058N2SBS,"Not a lot scares me, when it comes to movies, anyway. I can watch the goriest horror movie, and not be scared, even in the slightest. But ""Contagion"" got under my skin. It has more effect than even the most well-done horror movie, yet, it's not really a horror movie at all. It's mostly a psychological disaster film, and at one point, it feels like something of a docudrama, and then it morphs into a humane psychology story, and has overtones of the power of paranoia and fear that start when the film begins, and don't end until the last, satisfying moments.

""Contagion"" is director Steven Soderbergh's first feature this year. A few years ago, he directed two films in the same year, Matt Damon comedy-thriller studio-produced vehicle ""The Informant!"" and porn star Sasha Grey's first mainstream (albeit indie) film, ""The Girlfriend Experience"". This year, he repeats himself, doing two films in the same year, this, and the upcoming independent action thriller ""Haywire"". I'm intrigued to see that one as well, but I can't see it being any better than ""Contagion"".

""Contagion"" scared the living crap out of me. It follows characters, living throughout the world, all effected by a mysterious pandemic that threatens the lives of everyone. It's something like bird flu, but not quite. It has the worldwide reaction that H1N1 had on the world, but worse. It becomes a government conspiracy tale, that proves that something of this catastrophic weight is not a cut-and-dry kind of thing. There are twists coming from each imaginable angle. The biggest mystery is how this thing began, which isn't ignored, like I thought it would be.

One thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it, is a lot of big names. Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Everybody brings more to the table than you expect them to. Each character's story becomes vital to how the story unfolds, and, even as it begins to delude into something of a cut-and-dry docudrama, it pulls the wool out from under your eyes, and surprises you with realistic, yet not melodramatic emotion, and becomes quite the emotionally draining and devastating tale, leaving such an impression on the audience, making this one impossible to tune out.

I choose, for this review, not to really get into each character's story, because, one, it would take up too much time, and two, it's much better experienced, not knowing very much about it, as the story unfolds.

It'll stick with you for longer than you expect it to. I read advance reviews before seeing it today, that claim that leaving the theatre, no one in the audience spoke about it, or touched anyone, or contacted with anyone around them. Paranoia is a main ingredient to ""Contagion"", proving that no one is immune to fear that is unspoken, but completely pinpointed, and like I said, impossible to ignore. Seeing an afternoon show, in the college town where I live with a few friends of mine, I didn't quite experience this. However, it's completely believable. It leaves you in such a state of paranoia and euphoria, that it's maddening, considering that there aren't many films like this nowadays.

Another thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it is how it's made. Soderbergh doesn't waste any time here. Keeping it concise, at a humane running time (105 minutes), it's a roller-coaster from the very first unsettling scene, right up until the last frame. It's written in a way that feels overall very clinical and to-the-point, yet becomes an emotional journey that makes you feel something for each one of its characters.

The scariest thing about ""Contagion"" is its plausibility. Unlike your regular horror movie, it has a base which actually could happen, and has happened, in the past. The scares come from things that human beings encounter every day. No ghosts or zombies (in the literal sense of the world) pop out and scare you, while the typical ominous, trying-to-be scary score plays in the background. It's proof that the quietest movies can be the most terrifying. There's a horrifying atmosphere about this one, that sneaks up on you when you least expect it to. This is compelling stuff, don't miss it.

Grade: A-",1324684800,4,4200,4.922316384180791
4601118,3,B0058N2SBS,"This movie is a decent try but it has too much sugar and euphemism to be great. The director is trying to show us the reality but he also admits that the reality is too harsh for most of us to accept.

Who wants to see dead bodies scatter all over the street and periodically explode from gases generated from decomposition? He is right. How many of us have the audacity to face the reality? Let me paint a little about the reality and then you can decide as how unrealistic this movie is.

The virus depicted in the film is NOT realistic at all and could be easily avoided by simply staying at home for two weeks because after that, all the infected hosts would be dead. A truly deadly virus doesn't kill its host so quickly. The incubation period, when the host is highly contagious but showing no symptom, should be about a few months or a little more. By the time it breaks out, it would be too late as everybody would be infected and only the immune would survive.

In reality, it is not the virus that is scary. Assuming staying at home doesn't help, an outbreak like this (killing millions with no cure in sight) would cause a major disruption in our infrastructure, particularly transportation. Given most of us depend on transportation for food and etc. to survive and hardly any of us have food that last more than a week, most of us would starve to death in a month or so.

After two weeks of food supply disruption, a major riot would set in. In major cities, only those with weapons and the willingness to kill for food would survive. After a few months or so, everybody would be killing each other for food. Only those who live in the rural area with access to farms would have a chance. They would still need to have enough weapon and enough organization in themselves to band together because a large swarm of hungry city-dwellers would immediately set upon them. They would have to decide to serve them food so that all would be starved to death shortly, kill them, be killed or all of the above.

Looting the stores and homes shown in the movie is not shocking at all. In reality, before long, it would be common to sell human body parts in meat markets and those unfortunate would be hunted down and eaten.

The government? Don't bet on that. It took FEMA a long time to supply water after Katrina, and took weeks to restore order when food was plenty. It would take probably 2 years to develop the vaccine and another 2 years or so to produce enough of that in peace time. However, because of the disruption in social order and transportation, that time could easily triple or become much longer if not never. By the time all said and done, we would be probably looking at half of the population gone if not more - most would starve to death; others would die of other diseases and unnatural causes (killed by our fellow humans).

By the way, once the looting starts, the government would quickly issue a decree to confiscate every firearm and ammunition and stop any sales of such. I laughed when I saw Matt Damon went to find guns for protection from his neighbor. For those of you who don't believe in firearms, well, if you don't believe in firearms to begin with, you should stick to your believes, be true to yourself, and wait defenselessly until they come to rob you and rape and kill your daughter. Things like this can happen and have happened many times such as LA Riot and Katrina. When law and order breaks down, it is up to you and your firearms to protect yourself and your loved ones!

For those who believe in the government, what described in the movie is quite true. The government would blockade any infected areas to prevent the infection from spreading, a procedure called ""quarantine."" This is the primary duty of the government - to protect society as a whole. However, for those left in the quarantine zone, they would be on their own for survival in the face of brutal riots and starvation.

Hard to contemplate, right? Read some history books and read books like One Second After or Lights Out if you want a better understanding.

Oh, in such a huge outbreak, cell phone and Internet still work? I wouldn't even expect to see any electricity or water.

The movie is not too terrible but you should understand how much sugar is loaded in there. :-)",1324512000,4,4294,4.471264367816092
4601119,4,B0058N2SBS,"This film is close to being a hybrid between a documentary and fictional tale.  It is also an ensemble cast which can be difficult to pull off but this movie manages it. Basically, a very lethal virus sweeps the world, turning into a pandemic.  There is HUGE loss of life until a vaccine is developed.  The first case which brings it into the USA is Gwyn Paltrow who flies home from Asia to Minnesota.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT. ONE PERSON CONSIDERED THE REMAINDER A SPOILER SO I AM PUTTING IN A SPOILER ALERT.

Within a very short time of being home with a cold, she goes into convulsions, is taken to the hospital and dies. Her son goes next and is replicates at swift speed after that. I never once felt that this was a science fiction film or one of these comic book based action films.  It seemed to develop exactly as such a pandemic would develop around the world.

There is an all star cast.  It would be nice to have more screen time for some of them but then we'd miss getting the bigger picture.  People do panic, loot, try to escape, kidnap people for vaccine trades and so forth and so on.

There is a trade off for all of this reality and ensemble acting.  That is that you never really come to care about anyone or want to explore their stories further.  You do feel sorry for Paltrow's husband, Matt Damon, and his daughter, who are left to deal with their own tragedy.  However, his character would have to be onscreen a lot longer for one to really work up a connection with his character.

4601120,2,B0058N2SBS,"I think the writer did a good job researching CDC protocols and virus microbiology, fruitbat as the vector, etc., but the subplots tended to be irritating. The overblown storyline about the blogger stands out the most, but even fishburn's bit with the janitor's son, or the microbiologist savior's kissing scene with her dad just made it seem like an over-dramatized made-for-tv movie.

Like a CSI episode it is as if the writer learned some tidbits of information about the virus pathology industry during research, then makes up some hacked together supervirus, packaged with some flashy microbiology terms to give the impression of subject mastery.

Also the happy 'realistic' ending seemed ridiculous, given the nature of the virus they were dealing with. In a similar vein, I  suppose Steve will make a movie about the EPA stopping global warming next.

Being a Soderbergh film you will see a lot of imho over-dramatised imagery and acting, complete with actors giving 'naturalistic' pauses, stammers, reactions, misspeaks, etc. Perhaps i've grown cynical, but it comes off as very self-indulgent.

4601121,5,B0058N2SBS,"As a close follower of health news with some background in science reporting, I found this film utterly frightening in its realism.  From a combination of factors - perhaps statistically inevitable, just like a nuclear accident - a new disease emerges.  It is the product of a mix of DNA, bred in a factory farm in Asia by a freak occurrence.  When transmitted, it grows explosively due to modern transportation; unbelievably deadly, it kills up to 30% of those infected.  Their deaths are horrible to witness.  As a result, within a month, modern society suffers a near-complete breakdown, with panic, rising lawlessness, and in the end mayhem.

The plot progresses through a number of characters, some normal people, some remarkable public servants, some self-seeking charlatans.  Paltrow is one of the first victims, a strange elimination but also the perfect vehicle to retrace her steps throughout the film.  Damon is her husband, a good man out of work whose life is thrown into painful turmoil and a struggle for survival.  Cottilard, Winslet, and several others are dedicated officials, whose desperate actions form a fascinating quest to contain and then cure the disease; it is good to see bureaucrats portrayed with realistic and deserved respect.  I will not go on as this could spoil the plot.

4601126,3,B0058N2SBS,"CONTAGION, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is an intensely frightening look at what really could happen should a new and unidentified virus begin to spread globally. Unfortunately, it's not a very successful film. What makes it work is its documentary-style script, which takes viewers through the spread of the virus, the reaction of both governments and everyday people, and the fear that ends up possessing the world. What makes it unsuccessful is actually the same thing - the documentary style of the film makes it almost impossible to become emotionally connected to any of the characters, most of which are played by people we know and want to care about. Because Soderbergh keeps us so detached from his characters, CONTAGION never quite jells as a truly gripping thriller.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays Beth Emhof, whose business trip to Hong Kong ends up infecting her (and a lot of other people) with a mysterious and deadly virus. Her husband Mitch (Matt Damon), back home in Minneapolis, is inexplicably immune to the disease, and his horror at what happens to his wife and young step-son is palpable and gut-wrenching. Unfortunately, we see so little of Mitch (and even less of Beth) that it's hard to stay connected. Kate Winslet plays CDC doctor Erin Mears, and for a while we get caught up in her race to unravel the mysteries of this terrible virus. But the film jumps so methodically from Dr. Mears to her boss, Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), to World Health Organization investigator Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) - and it's hard to keep up, much less get invested in these characters. On top of that, there's a very involved sub-plot about a self-serving Internet journalist (Jude Law) who mouths off about unsavory political connections between the CDC/WHO and the pharmaceutical companies, while he's trying to push a homeopathic remedy that could make him a multi-millionaire. There's also a kidnapping plot, lots of scenes of people gone amok, and a very quick resolution to the virus that is neither comprehensible nor particularly satisfying.

Parts of CONTAGION are downright mesmerizing, and there's no doubt Soderbergh knows how to push the panic buttons of moviegoers already worried about H1N1, AIDS, and the latest strain of flu. I just wanted to feel more of a connection to Damon's Mitch, or Winslet's Erin Mears, or Fishburne's Cheever, or Cotillard's Leonora. Soderbergh ends CONTAGION with the kind of lack of closure that will either infuriate its audience or confirm the ultimate reality of its subject matter. Don't expect to find out what happens to everyone . . . or anyone, for that matter. Then again, maybe Soderbergh did us all a favor by keeping us distanced from his characters and not allowing us to actually wrap our proverbial arms around them. It's easier to forget about them that way. And this is definitely a film you won't want to keep thinking about in the wee hours of the morning.",1323734400,105,2950,4.9939024390243905

4601128,4,B0058N2SBS,"Reposted from September 25, 2011

It figures a week after I've seen CONTAGION, director Steven Soderbergh's latest ensemble film, I come down with a cold and a slight cough. Nothing that can't be cured easily with two gel capsules and a glass of water, mind you; however, being sick this week did cause me to pause about the circumstances of my situation.

My dumb cold is nothing compared to the shellacking that Gwyneth Paltrow's character goes through within the first 20 minutes of the film: Rushed to the emergency room by hubby Matt Damon, Paltrow goes bug-eyed, convulses, and flatlines. Yep, Our Lady of GOOP goes down in the first half of the film. Much of Contagion is straight to the point with a sledgehammer, but the stakes are never so much higher as soon as Soderbergh kills off one of its leading stars.

Similar to the multi-threaded storytelling seen in TRAFFIC, CONTAGION tracks a global epidemic in multiple locales across 90-minutes-or-so. One death becomes three, three become nine, and so on, until governments begin panicking, big pharma clasps its hands in anticipation, and the CDC works day and night looking for a cure. Soderbergh deftly avoids the usual plot contrivances and lavish expenses that plague most disaster flicks, choosing to go for brisk montages of society breaking down as people loot Rite Aids for medicine, corpses piling in the street, and long lines at hospitals.

And the talking! If there ever was a film that avoids sloppy expostion, this is it. There's never a moment in CONTAGION where I felt the characters reduced their dialogue to a Cliff Notes pamphlet. At one point, Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne--both playing a scientist and the head honcho of the CDC respectively--have a sit-down to discuss a mutation in the virus. It's probably the most compelling dramatic scene I've seen this year, if nothing else but to hear the excitement and terror in Ehle's voice as she describes changes in the contagion's pattern and Fishburne calmly nodding in agreement.

CONTAGION is intelligent--in some ways, almost overthinking itself. We need more films like it (and not another Roland Emmerich bloatfest), and we need more directors like Soderbergh who are willing to put their roots from independent ""art"" films into big-budget genre films.

And if nothing else, you can blame the deaths of 12 million people or so on Gwyneth Paltrow.",1323561600,135,2390,5.007556675062972

4601132,5,B0058N2SBS,"My wife and I saw this movie recently.  We had a two-person date deal that included a large popcorn and two large drinks, but frankly we found it difficult to enjoy any of the snacks while watching ""Contagion"".

The story line is gut-wrenchingly realistic...so much so that I wonder why an outbreak of the type shown in this film hasn't happened before.  The portrayal of the effects of an extremely virulent virus are graphically portrayed, and the manner of death is grim and gritty to say the least.  If you go to see this show you need to be prepared to see (or look away from) a depiction of an autopsy where a person's skull is opened and the skin on the top of the head is pulled over the top of the face (just FYI).

References to the technical aspects of identifying and fighting a disease like this was the central focus of the film, but there was not so much technical info that it would put off most viewers.  Yet, at the same time, there were enough of the technical aspects that a scientist would have something to chew on.

Be prepared to have a flutter in your stomach throughout most of this movie.  Also be prepared for extremely tense drama, including pulses of strong language.

The collection of top-notch actors in this film is quite impressive, and while outbreak kinds of movies have been produced several times over the past several years, this one was top-notch.  It did not seem self-serving or contrived.  The air of authenticity in the film was overwhelming.

The film is compelling in a cautionary vision of social and political breakdown that could accompany a global pandemic.  Scarily compelling!

I noticed that a few other reviews (i.e., 1-star reviews) stated that this was the most boring film that they'd seen in a long time.  Well, all I have to say about that is that if you go to this film expecting lots of gunfire, explosions, brain-eating zombies or the like you are going to be disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for intelligent drama and a story line that is both plausible and terrifying then ""Contagion"" is for you.

All in all this film is simultaneously outstanding, disconcerting, grim,and gritty.

4601133,3,B0058N2SBS,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" is a dark and depressing film, with a stellar cast that includes Matt Damon as Mitch, whose wife, Beth, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, becomes infected with a deadly and highly contagious virus.  In short order, men, women, and children become ill in various places all over the world; they cannot swallow, have a hacking cough, sweat profusely, convulse, foam at the mouth, and subsequently die.  Laurence Fishburne is solemn as Doctor Ellis Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control.  Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) of the World Health Organization, Dr. Erin Mears (an excellent performance by Kate Winslet), and Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) all work tirelessly to contain what could potentially turn into a pandemic. Elliot Gould nicely underplays his role as a brilliant scientist named Dr. Sussman.

Unfortunately, Soderbergh's directorial style is somewhat remote and unfeeling, distancing the audience from the proceedings.  The editing is disjointed and choppy, making the plot difficult to follow at times.  There is plenty of gore and horror, but it does not seem quite real.  Although Mitch and his daughter, Jory, share some touching scenes, most of the characters rush around madly against the pulsating backdrop of a loud and menacing musical soundtrack. Also on hand is the slimy Alan (Jude Law), a snide blogger who claims that the pharmaceutical companies are greedy villains who profit from the public's misery. With the virus spreading so quickly, people start to panic.  The director inserts scenes of chaos, looting, and violence to reveal the bestiality that lies beneath our thin veneer of civilization.

Screenwriter Scott Z. Burns seems to be warning us that with people traveling all over the globe every day, an outbreak similar to the one described in this movie could occur at any time. Still, ""Contagion"" is more of a CliffsNotes version of an epidemic and its aftermath than a meaningful treatment of what such a catastrophe would entail.",1321747200,,2010,5.25625

The spread of the contagion, the looting and public panic, the blackmail, the dishonesty, paranoia, and so forth were very realistically portrayed.  Despite what some other reviewers have claimed (ie, this ""...could NEVER happen!!""), I can totally see something like this happening.  With people who refuse to vaccinate their children leading to a resurgence of once-eradicated diseases and with significant percentages of the population failing to wash their hands on a regular basis, diseases can spread very rapidly--just as is portrayed in the movie.  It's a scenario I hope I never see first-hand, but it was very engrossing and entertaining.  All of the performances are excellent and very believable.  The music by Cliff Martinez also deserves special mention, as both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  In fact, I may have to purchase the soundtrack.  I am also very tempted to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.  Really a good show and one I very highly recommend, although be aware that you may find yourself a tad paranoid for a while after seeing it.  :)",1319587200,,1235,4.889423076923077
4601137,4,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion might be described as a ""cinematic documentary"" (oxymoronic, I know) that realistically imagines what might happen if a new, initially unstoppable virus sprang up and killed people on a global scale. The movie doesn't actually sound particularly unique from the outset, with quotes like ""it's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out"", but when you think about it, most epidemic-themed films are completely fictional, while Contagion tries to paint a picture of what might really happen.

The story mostly centers around Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) who is immune to the disease and must protect his daughter from society's collapse, Alan Krumwiede the amateur freelance journalist with a conspiratorial mind, and Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard), an epidemiologist sent to Hong Kong to find the origin of the disease.

Most of the performances are solid and make you believe that what is happening in the movie is possible, as they react realistically to it. Cheever has to deal with the accusation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is overreacting to the virus and he is also harassed by Krumwiede. He's an intelligent and affable person, be he makes some bad mistakes.

I feared that the filmmakers might be trying to hard to give a ""normal"" perspective on things by including Matt Damon's character, but fortunately he sold the idea of a normal dad who has to become a desperate survivor in a dire time. Through him we can see a lot of how the contagion has a affected the masses, civilization committing suicide, if you will.

The other two protagonists are the weakest. I like Jude Law, but his character is a cardboard ""villain"" who gets more and more inhuman as the film progresses. Marion Cotillard's story line is useless (sans the scenes that show us how the disease spreads) and disappears for most of the film, before returning with zero resolution. You must sit through these parts of the movie wondering what the point is.

As the global situation worsens, people start rioting and looting and the like, and cities are quarantined. I felt like one or two sections where people started rioting were a bit abrupt, like there needed to be more build-up to show the insecurity of the populace, and then showing them finally snap and begin with the killing and destroying. But overall it's believable, and there are many sequences that portray the utterly ruined city littered with the dead. There is something intense about parts of this film, the cinematography and music combined with the believable premise and shots of the damage done. It constantly made me think to myself ""What if this happened? What would we do? What would I do?""

As great as it is, Contagion suddenly ends without ever coming to a point of absolute tension. The audience is suddenly sees how the contagion came about, though the characters are never shown to have learned this themselves. I could have used some more resolution to these character, who I had grown to care about, and perhaps to re-cooperation of the world. But Contagion just ends. It's great while it lasts though. It want to give it a 9, but it falls just short.

4601138,1,B0058N2SBS,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

In his new pseudo-documentary, Contagion, Steven Soderbergh has endorsed the idea that modern medicine has taken the place of world religion and elevated the physicians and research scientists to the role of high priests.  Soderbergh is in perfect sync with fear-mongering health organizations such as the CDC, who manufacture health epidemics in order to peddle vaccines to an unsuspecting public, who have gladly given up any sense of individual responsibility for taking care of their own health.  The 'Contagion' is an event that government health bureaucrats probably unconsciously wish for; after all, such an event would confirm all their dire predictions and place them in a position of complete power and control.  Victims in the 'Contagion' must undergo suffering akin to Christ on the cross.  Their rite of 'baptism' is through the modern vaccine, where their 'demons' are exorcised and they end up owing a life-time debt to the medical and research establishment for supposedly saving their life.

Unfortunately for modern medicine, contagions as depicted in Soderbergh's film, are strictly a work of complete fiction.  Invariably, every few years, the CDC, partnering with local health organizations, warn of crippling health pandemics, which can only be prevented by mass inoculations (leading to billions of dollars of profits by pharmaceutical companies).  Take, for example, West Nile Virus, one of the latest health scares which was supposed to cause havoc throughout North America.  Usually its small sample of victims turn out to be elderly people who already are suffering from a myriad of health problems.  But of course the pundits of orthodox medicine conclude that all these peoples' problems stem from a single source: a mosquito bite.

In Soderbergh's perverse world, alternative practitioners are the 'heretics' who must be suppressed. Jude Law's blogger, Alan Krumweide, has the temerity to expose CDC head Ellis Cheever, who has given advance warning of the impending contagion crisis to family and friends so that they're able to flee Chicago before a quarantine has been imposed. Soderbergh's strategy is to temporarily have Krumweide take down the saintly Cheever a peg, in order to show that he's 'only human'. Later saintly Cheever, gives up his own precious vaccine to save the son of a janitor who works at CDC headquarters. The 'fallen' Cheever (also blamed for delays in the dissemination of an effective vaccine) is restored to the pantheon of saints after his self-sacrifice involving the janitor's son. Meanwhile, Krumweide is exposed as a fraud, after peddling a homeopathic remedy as a cure (which he's surreptitiously marketed to investors) and pretending as well that he's been infected with the virus. Homeland Security partners with modern medicine, just as the Catholic church found their own government allies in bygone days, to take down anyone who dared to question their dogmatic belief systems. Soderbergh is smugly satisfied as the 'evil' blogger is taken away in handcuffs by 'valiant' government security agents!

If the imperfect Dr. Cheever is 'canonized' at film's end, there's no need for Dr. Ally Hextall to have her reputation sullied at all. After all, it's Dr. Hextall who identifies the characteristics of the MEV-1 virus , linking it to a genetic mix of bat and pig viruses. Hextall's role here is way beyond a mere priest. She can be likened to a modern day Jesus, a veritable Savior, who miraculously discovers that elusive cure, a vaccine that immediately provides the immunity to the deadly contagion. At the conclusion of 'Contagion', we learn of the pseudo-science behind the MEV-1 virus' origins. It's simply a matter of a bat dropping part of an uneaten banana into a pig's trough. The pig who eats the infected banana ends up in the kitchen of a Macao casino; and because the chef merely forgets to wash his hands, he somehow transmits the virus to Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow). On the other hand, it's unclear why others, such as everyman Mitch Emhoff and his daughter Jory, are immune to the virus, despite close contact with initial victim Beth.

If alternative practitioners are directly linked to the work of the devil, bureaucrats who seek to stymie the 'godly' work of vaccine researchers, run a close second. Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) an 'Epidemic Intelligence Officer' is rebuffed by local bureaucrats who are reluctant to commit resources to handle the impending crisis. Worse are the officials who send a ransom of placebos following World Health Organization epidemiologist Orantes's kidnapping by a Chinese epidemiologist after he attempts to save the remaining survivors in his own village who have no access to the 'precious' vaccines. Note more saintly self-sacrifice: Dr. Mears succumbs to the deadly contagion and Orantes nobly runs back to the village to warn them that the vaccines they've obtained, are bogus!

In the 1950s, orthodox medicine elevated their first 'miracle worker' to the pantheon of modern day world saviors. That man's name was Dr. Jonas Salk--creator of the polio vaccine. Now Soderbergh wants to outdo even Salk; his 'Contagion' can perhaps be seen as an allegory, likening the deadly plague to cancer itself. Soderbergh's vaccine is so powerful, that it prevents the eradication of the human race.

Ultimately, Soderbergh never questions the 'gospel truth' of modern orthodox medicine but always sticks to the 'company line'. Instead he would do well to listen to Edda West who cogently sets the record straight in regards to that earlier 'epidemic' in her article, 'Polio Perspectives': ""That the polio virus is the sole cause of polio is accepted by most people as gospel, and that the Salk and Sabin vaccines eradicated polio in the western world is etched into our collective consciousness as the major medical miracle of our time. But the history of polio and its vaccines is shrouded in a murky mist of politico/scientific manipulation, altered statistics, redefinition and reclassification of the disease, increased cases of vaccine induced paralytic polio, and monkey viruses transmitted by contaminated vaccines to millions of people worldwide.""",1317686400,,6207,5.2555555555555555
4601139,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion begins with a boom: Any movie that has the boldness to kill off Gwyneth Paltrow in the first ten minutes is guaranteed to capture the audience's attention. Paltrow's character dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and the rest of the movie is spent attempting to identify the disease that killed her and to vaccinate against it.

Contagion's plot is close enough to reality that you won't have to suspend disbelief, and you'll leave the theater with a lingering desire for hand sanitizer. The story is just close enough to reality to draw you to the edge of your seat, but ultimately the movie fails to satisfy.

Contagion has great potential, only increased by its fascinating and compelling first twenty minutes. Ultimately you'll leave the theater entertained but somewhat underwhelmed. Plot holes and minimal resolution make this movie finish far worse than the opening scenes lead you to expect.

(For those who might be a bit squeamish -- there are only a couple of scenes during which you'll want to look away: one with frighteningly-realistic and graphic seizures, and another involving an autopsy.)",1317600000,,1111,5.12707182320442
4601140,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich, The Limey) and written by Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!), is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's a highly interesting film about the outbreak of a global pandemic and how various organizations and individuals respond to it.  It has an all-star cast of highly talented actors, it's well researched and intelligently written, and the director manages to follow all of the interweaving sub-stories fairly smoothly.  But all of that said, I found that in the end, except for the odd bit here and there, I was never emotionally engaged by it.  Which, when you remember that you're witnessing the deaths of about half of the characters you see on the screen, is a strong indication that something important is missing.

The best part of the film is in the two opening sequences.  In the first sequence, with no real dialogue to speak of, we see a stream of images, of people touching things, of other people then touching those things, then touching themselves, then touching other people, the camera following contact to contact as the viewer is wordlessly shown just how fast and how wide a virus or bacterium could potentially spread.  Then, in the second sequence, the story actually begins on Day Two of the outbreak, and we are shown three individuals - a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) on a plane coming back to Minnesota from a trip, a young Chinese man (Tien You Chui) in Hong Kong going home from work, and a Japanese businessman (Yoshiaki Kobayashi) on a commuter train in Tokyo - all of whom are all coming down with something. And from these three people, the pandemic proceeds to spread.  The real thing that makes the viewer stay to the end is the final revelation of the mystery:  just where did the virus come from and how were these disparate individuals linked together.  Soderbergh accomplishes this in a clever way which, looking back, should have been obvious from the beginning.  He starts the story at Day Two, but only at the end does he take us back to Day One where all of the clues we are shown along the way are finally tied together.

On a technical level, Contagion is praiseworthy for grounding its medical and biological aspects firmly in actual science and in portraying the various government and international health organizations realistically in terms of how they actually respond to infectious outbreaks.  And Contagion is also commendable for showing that not everything goes smoothly, that even in the face of a lethal epidemic, overlapping agencies can be fractious over matters of administrative turf and budget, that commercial considerations can delay critically-needed actions, and that some individuals will take advantage of privilege and power to protect themselves at the expense of others.

But for all of its technical accuracy and the clarity of its presentation, Contagion never seems to really connect emotionally.  Part of the reason for this failure to connect on an emotional level is that there really are no surprises. Almost every clich that tends to pop up in this genre shows up here.  The doctor who uses herself as a guinea pig to test the vaccine.  The health official who violates ethics by calling to warn his wife to get out of the city before a quarantine is ordered, who in turn ends up telling other people.  The scientist who goes against orders and comes up with a vitally needed discovery.  The riots that ensue when a pharmacy runs out of a medication. Social order breaking down.  About every other character dying at some point.  And finally, a cure is found and the world is saved.  The end.

The other part of why Contagion fails to connect is that, in attempting for a global scope, it spreads itself too thin where its characters are concerned.  The ensemble cast is impressive.  Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff, the first victim we see succumb to the virus.  Matt Damon as Mitch, her husband, does a creditable job as a man who struggles to cope with the fact that his wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well. Other myriad roles are filled by high caliber actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, Chin Han and others.  There's also a cameo with TV's ubiquitous health authority Dr. Sanjay Gupta as himself.  But all of that acting power ends up largely being wasted because the individual characters are limited in their screen time and character development often ends up being sacrificed to the needs of the plot.  Damon, with Anna Jacoby-Heron as his teen-aged daughter, Jory, gets more screen time than most as the film tries to show what ordinary people would be experiencing in this situation, but again the lack of surprises and the been-there-seen-that feel of their scenes works against him.

Two particular performances however are worth pointing out.  Elliot Gould does a low key but perfect turn as Dr. Ian Sussman, a research scientist who decides to follow his instincts and goes against orders to destroy his samples, resulting in a key breakthrough.  In a brief but touching scene, Gould conveys Sussman's weighing the difficulty of his decision just through his facial expression and body language, a masterful performance by a highly underrated actor.  And Jude Law's less than scrupulous freelance blog-journalist Alan Krumwiede (a perfect name for his low-life character) fills the role of the film's only real human villain.  A brief scene between the two gives the film its best single line:  ""Blogging isn't writing,"" an exasperated Gould vents at Law, who's been pestering him for information. ""It's graffiti with punctuation!""  And in another scene with a pharmaceutical rep, Law gets in the film's other memorable line:  ""It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.""

All in all, Contagion isn't a bad film.  It is interesting if you want a believable and fairly accurate portrayal of just how this scenario would likely unfold.  But the human element is largely lost in the mix, which robs the film of the emotional impact you instinctively feel a film of this sort should have.  Recommended, but adjust your expectations accordingly.",1317513600,3,6302,4.8964218455743875
4601141,3,B0058N2SBS,"Contagion is about a group of people who must deal with the spread and containment of a highly contagious disease. Based on that statement you could probably guess what might happen. Sick people, a search for the cure, and widespread panic. Contagion is exactly what you think it is. Not to say that's bad, but I was not surprised by anything I saw.

The disease starts in Hong Kong, from there it is carried by Gwyneth Paltrow back to the states where she and her son die within a day or so. Her husband Matt Damon, immune to the disease, is left to take care of himself and his daughter.

Meanwhile Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, and a few other major players are notified of numerous deaths happening around the world. The disease is spreading quickly, and the Center for Disease Control must find a vaccination and keep the public calm.

Jude Law a conspiracy blogger/journalist broke the story first. He questions if the CDC is really trying to help. He finds a medicine that he believes cures the disease, and spreads the word. As millions become affected chaos breaks out, road blocks are set up, and the people go nuts.

Soderbergh directed an all star cast. Scott Burns wrote a fairly smart script. The movie was well put together and entertaining enough, but nothing more than you'd expect. I wish Soderbergh would have gotten a little more experimental, maybe tinted the movie red or something like he did with Traffic. It seems like disease outbreak movies can go in one of two directions. An epidemic occurs and everyone turns into flesh eating zombies Aka 28 days later & I am Legend. Or an epidemic probably stemming from an animal becomes widespread, and the government works to contain the disease and the world seemingly goes insane Aka Outbreak.

I honestly felt like Contagion was too predictable and brought in tons of characters the movie couldn't devote enough time to explore. John Hawkes who I loved in Winter's Bone, plays a Janitor who shows up only once in each act of the movie, his character seemed compelling, but was pretty much wasted. The movie somewhat explored the idea that the government and CDC took care of their own before the average person. Hawkes character could have been used to show the struggles and desperation of a lower income individual taking care of his family during this epidemic.

Winslet and Cotillard were intriguing as well, but are never really explored. They came and went without us really knowing anything about them. I completely forgot about Cotillard until they mildly tie up her story near the end. I think this movie could have benefited from chopping off some of the extra meat. There were probably 7 or 8 main characters introduced, and only 2 or 3 were given the proper time to develop. Contagion tried to be this massive story about all these different people, but it just couldn't be done in 100 minutes.

For this movie to work, they were really gonna have to get us involved with these characters. So when they cry, we cry. When they are angry, we get angry, and so on. They basically just dumped on Matt Damon's character the whole movie, and by the end, sure I felt bad for him, but I wasn't really upset. His wife was cheating on him, he couldn't give his family a proper funeral, and he was stuck inside with no food protecting his daughter for months. I was more like, ""jesus christ"" cut this guy a break. You waited for some kind of reprieve, but what they gave him was pretty unsatisfying.

On the positive side, I always say if I can finish a movie in one sitting it was pretty good. And like I said the cast was impressive. Matt Damon is a great actor and he did what he could with the wiggle room he was given. He had two key emotional scenes, hearing his wife has died and dealing with it at the end, both were good. Jude Law probably had the best overall part. They flipped him around so rapidly, you're never really sure of his motives. He was probably my favorite character.

I really did like contagion, it just didn't add anything to the genre. If you're going to make a movie on a topic that's already been explored, you have to find a unique way to tell the story. This movie just rang repetition in my ears, and it'll quickly be forgotten.

The actors did a good job with the material they had.

4601143,5,B0058N2SBS,"First, it's a great catastrophe movie. Star-power doesn't guarantee a good flick, Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburn, Jude Law, and a flock others do their best to raise this movie a level, and their efforts pay off. The script gives them a chance to do their best - a believable outbreak, as contagious as SARS and as deadly as Ebola starts in a remote corner of the world. It propagates at the speed of jet travel to every major population center, and then the fatalities start to come in. It doesn't reach ""Mad Max"" levels of post-apocalyptic collapse, but does show how social structure sould shudder under the blows. And, in a thoroughly modern touch, the rationality of the CDC is offset by a wingnut internet conspiracy theorist who believes that the government is suppressing life-saving floral extracts.

Among all disaster flicks, this stands out for one reason: it gets the science right. Ian Lipkin, M.D. and director of the Northeast Biodefense Center, consulted heavily. The movie virus, although fictional, followed the same path to people via bats and pigs as the real-world Nipah virus did. The movie virus fictionally attacks a genuine human receptor, but the imagined protein actually bonds to a genuine receptor site in biochemical simulations. Lipkin had Winslet pipetting and running gels, and showed Elliot Gould how to handle liquid nitrogen without freezing his hand off (as reported in Science magazine, 2 Sep 2011). Lipkin also suggested the bogus cures spreading across the internet, as actually happened in the SARS outbreak.

That said, they didn't do so well on some of the CDC procedures, but hey. They got a big one right, and set the standard for future plague movies. What they did right, they did beautifully right - in addition to making some good entertainment.

4601144,5,B0058N2SBS,"The fears and realities of global viruses have always been in existence since travel was basically invented; but with the explosion of all kinds of technology and modes of transportation, those fears and realities have exploded.  Even as far back as 1918, a virulent strain known as the Spanish flu killed 800,000 people in the United States alone, and as many as eighteen million more across the world.  In our time, such things as bird flu, swine flu, SARS, and H1N1 have put health officials in all corners of the world on edge, especially when it is found out that the strains often develop immunities to the very vaccines we use to treat them.  This is the subject dealt with in CONTAGION, a solid medical science fiction/suspense docudrama that has a degree of realism fueled by a combination of fact and speculation.

Like more than a few disaster epics of the 1970s, CONTAGION puts a large cast of all-stars in an insightful, disturbing, and highly charged situation as an unnamed virus, which begins its deadly spread throughout the world as the result of an innocuous occurrence involving a female executive (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong spreads into America, infecting just a few people at first, but pretty soon exploding into a health crisis the likes of which no country has ever seen.  Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet are the doctors based out of CDC headquarters in Atlanta who try to develop the appropriate vaccines for this strain, which, like so many flu bugs, has a genetic code to it seemingly meant to ward off any kind of medicine applied to it.  Marion Cottilard is the French doctor sent by the World Health Organization (WHO) to Hong Kong to track the exact origin of the flu.  Jude Law portrays a conspiracy blogger who contends that the CDC and governments all over the world have the antidote in their hands but are not willing to share it so as to cash in on the deaths of what eventually turn out to be tens of millions of people.  Matt Damon portrays Paltrow's grieving husband who has to stand watch over his two motherless children who might be infected, even though he himself already has the right amount of antibodies to avoid catching the strain.

While there have been more than a few ""virus/disease"" films over the years, CONTAGION seems to be the most realistic of the bunch, and, as a result, probably the most frightening.  The tendency to have the entire cast go into hysterics over people dropping dead like flies all around is wisely avoided by director Steven Soderbergh, whose credits include ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC.  Instead, he opts for a docudrama-like approach, with numerous sequences of hand-held camera movements that make the drama seem as realistic as possible without dipping into technique for technique's sake.  The situation is highly realistic, as anyone who has studied the history of previous viral epidemics will easily attest to; not only are such pandemics possible today, they are practically inevitable when taken into account the way technology and travel have evolved, and given the everyday habits of people that can lead to viruses being spread around without anyone knowing about it until it has already happened to them.

Instead of being another scary Hollywood shocker (though it is definitely scary), CONTAGION largely succeeds at putting up a plausible scenario for an infectious disease mutating into a worldwide problem in which a cure can't come fast enough.  Furthermore, it also urges us to think about how the entire world's population has become so interdependent on others in times of crises, such as viral epidemics of the kind depicted in this film.",1316390400,,3649,4.912195121951219
4601145,2,B0058N2SBS,"What a boring anticlimactic movie.  After reading some initial comments, I was prepared to be scared to death to go out in public after viewing this.  I have a tendency to be that person who is turning a corner in the grocery store as someone is sneezing, so I was prepared to have all of my worst fears confirmed.  That society's lack of basic prevention, like washing your hands and not touching your face, would be reinforced - but that was not the case.

Beginning on Day 2 of an initial outbreak, you see Gwyneth Paltrow as Elizabeth Emhoff returning from a trip to Hong Kong with what appears to be a case of the flu.  From bad to worse millions are quickly infected with this unknown pathogen thus putting the world into a panic and every major health organization quickly attempting to find a vaccine.  Still not sure the real reason for some of the name actors (Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Elliott Gould, Laurence Fishburne) in this story, but I guess that is what you have to do to bring people to a movie such as this.

Do not waste your time with this snooze-fest.  What it boils down to is that the wrong bat and the wrong pig meet up in Hong Kong and the world is thrown into a tizzy over it.",1316304000,,1214,4.317180616740088
4601146,3,B0058N2SBS,"CONTAGION, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is an intensely frightening look at what really could happen should a new and unidentified virus begin to spread globally.  Unfortunately, it's not a very successful film.  What makes it work is its documentary-style script, which takes viewers through the spread of the virus, the reaction of both governments and everyday people, and the fear that ends up possessing the world.  What makes it unsuccessful is actually the same thing - the documentary style of the film makes it almost impossible to become emotionally connected to any of the characters, most of which are played by people we know and want to care about.  Because Soderbergh keeps us so detached from his characters, CONTAGION never quite jells as a truly gripping thriller.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays Beth Emhof, whose business trip to Hong Kong ends up infecting her (and a lot of other people) with a mysterious and deadly virus.  Her husband Mitch (Matt Damon), back home in Minneapolis, is inexplicably immune to the disease, and his horror at what happens to his wife and young step-son is palpable and gut-wrenching.  Unfortunately, we see so little of Mitch (and even less of Beth) that it's hard to stay connected.  Kate Winslet plays CDC doctor Erin Mears, and for a while we get caught up in her race to unravel the mysteries of this terrible virus.  But the film jumps so methodically from Dr. Mears to her boss, Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), to World Health Organization investigator Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) - and it's hard to keep up, much less get invested in these characters.  On top of that, there's a very involved sub-plot about a self-serving Internet journalist (Jude Law) who mouths off about unsavory political connections between the CDC/WHO and the pharmaceutical companies, while he's trying to push a homeopathic remedy that could make him a multi-millionaire.  There's also a kidnapping plot, lots of scenes of people gone amok, and a very quick resolution to the virus that is neither comprehensible nor particularly satisfying.

Parts of CONTAGION are downright mesmerizing, and there's no doubt Soderbergh knows how to push the panic buttons of moviegoers already worried about H1N1, AIDS, and the latest strain of flu.  I just wanted to feel more of a connection to Damon's Mitch, or Winslet's Erin Mears, or Fishburne's Cheever, or Cotillard's Leonora.  Soderbergh ends CONTAGION with the kind of lack of closure that will either infuriate its audience or confirm the ultimate reality of its subject matter.  Don't expect to find out what happens to everyone . . . or anyone, for that matter.  Then again, maybe Soderbergh did us all a favor by keeping us distanced from his characters and not allowing us to actually wrap our proverbial arms around them.  It's easier to forget about them that way.  And this is definitely a film you won't want to keep thinking about in the wee hours of the morning.",1316304000,,2966,4.9939024390243905
4601147,3,B0058N2SBS,"Went to see this tonight, it is an ok movie, and not what the trailers make it out to be. There is little suspense, but I have seen worse movies. Like ""Ferocious Planet"" or ""Arctic Blast."" (Which never pretended to be anything more than a made for tv B movie.)

1. There are a couple of completely unnecessary plot lines, that by the end of the movie are unresolved and just kind of left dangling. It's like they took several movie scripts, and tried to combine them into one. It would have been better to stick with one or two points of view, than trying to juggle so many different movie types.

2. At the beginning of the movie, there is a completely unrealistic scene of a doctor telling someone that their loved one is dead in a kind of offhand, ""I've got better things to be doing than talking to scum like you"" way. Like they were not worth his time, he failed to keep the patient alive, oh well, gotta go onto the next one. Little things like that that really throw you out of the movie reality and back into ours. (there were more, but that one was the one that really stood out)

3. Matt Damon's character is a bland, scared little sheep, waiting for the shepherd to tell him what to do. Sadly, this is one of the most realistic parts of the movie.

Not bad for watching at home, but not worth the $17 for two tickets. Won't be watching it again.",1316217600,,1356,4.244186046511628
4601148,4,B0058N2SBS,"This is truly an exceptional film.  First, as some frustrated reviewers pointed out who were expecting a faster-paced, cliched, Roland Emmerich type ""end of the world"" disaster flick, this is a relatively slow story about the deadly outbreak of an influenza virus that wipes out millions of people (much like the flu virus of 1918 that killed over 50-million people).  It's contains little of the hysteria and mass panic that normally characterizes the disaster genre film.  Instead, it presents a hyper-realistic version of an outbreak that is absolutely riveting precisely because it seems so likely and real.  I'd call CONTAGION nearly flawless with one major exception: A World Health Organization disease investigator sets off to Hong Kong to determine the origin of the disease.  While there, she works with a Chinese interpreter who has less than honorable intentions for her.  This track of the story seemed wholly unnecessary and was somewhat confusing.  It unfortunately cast a shadow over an otherwise near-perfect film.  But the distraction is not so bad that it significantly diminishes the impact of CONTAGION.  In fact, all the other elements of the story are so strong that I intend to see it again.  I'm sure there are things I missed in the first viewing that a second go-round will hopefully reveal.

Go see CONTAGION - if you're like the majority of moviegoers who have made it the number 1 film at the box office, you'll be thoroughly intrigued by the story.",1316217600,2,1479,5.020491803278689

A deadly virus is spreading around the world at an alarming rate and the CDC works to find out where it originated from and of course, a cure. The cast is packed full of stars, minus the heavy make-up and great lighting in order to resemble us normal people I guess. This is truly an ensemble piece with Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Laurence Fishburne having the most screen time. There is no real lead performance, which can be a bit jarring for some. There is a whole lot more talk than action, which may bore some, but I found it intriguing.

4601151,1,B0058N2SBS,"This was seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life; my girlfriend and I walked out after about 90 minutes as it was clear that nothing even mildly interesting was going to occur and there was no possible way to redeem the alleged ""plot"".

The writing was awful. The directing was pathetic. The character development was non-existent. The plot was as interesting as watching the Weather Channel. The dialog often seemed to be improvised on the spot, and not in a good/clever way either since the characters themselves were so lacking in depth. There was not a single redeeming quality to this movie.

It was not exciting, interesting, compelling, dramatic, novel...the most that could be said is that it was ""realistic"", in the same sense that watching CSPAN coverage of a congressional session is. I have no idea how anyone found this movie watchable, never mind ""excellent"".

After this pathetic excuse for a film, I fear that Soderbergh has followed the M. Night Shyamalan route of ineptitude into directorial oblivion.

I realize that some people liked this movie...I don't really understand how that's possible, but then some people like slasher flicks, some people like British humor, and some people even like watching televised political debates. It follows that there are bound to be some who found themselves entertained by this sad, dull not-anywhere-near-as-interesting-as-a-trainwreck of a movie.",1315785600,4,1426,5.1869565217391305
4601152,3,B0058N2SBS,"You have to give credit to the producers, director and writers of 'Contagion'; throw into a film a rapidly spreading virus, a race against time, scads of dying people and more getting sick every day, and they managed to make a film that was, well, in a word...boring.

The film has a great look, the acting is pretty good, the cast excellent, but there is little (and I mean little) suspense, few surprises, little tension.  Tepid is the word I'm looking for here, and that's not good when you're talking about a potentially stunning and exciting film.  To be honest, the film looks as though it was made by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) A/V department as a training film for new staff.  Maybe you'd bring it in to a Senate budget subcommittee hearing pleading for a larger budget.

What went wrong with 'Contagion'?  Well, to begin with, the script has no zing, no pizzazz, no life.  To employ a bad pun, the movie flatlines quite early.

And the ending?  Even more B-O-R-I-N-G! than the rest of the film.  Yeah, it answers a question I was sort of interested in.  Not that much, to be honest.  To say it was anti-climatic is to say that a film of someone sleeping is anti-climatic.  Actually, a guy sleeping would have more life than the ending to this film.

Remember 'Outbreak' with Dustin Hoffman?  That was a film about a similar subject, and it was immeasurably better than this film.  Heck, even the decades-old 'The Andromeda Strain' was a better film about an infection, and that disease only killed a few folks.

Do yourself a favor and don't let the great trailer and manufactured hype about the film get you to park your rear end in front of this film.  Skip it, and watch 'Outbreak' or 'The Andromeda Strain'.  Or watch a superior SF film like 'Contact' or 'Gattaca'.  Jude Law was in both this film and that the latter.  Damn, he was good in Gattaca.

Want to learn about how the CDC and the World Health Organization would confront a pandemic?  Like sitting through a lecture series on the subject?  Then this film is OK.  If you want unbearable tension, compelling characters, and twists and turns leading to a wholly unexpected ending?  Then this film, ain't that film.

Too bad.  I had high hopes for this one.  A wasted opportunity.  Who greenlighted this???

Update:  I was kind of right about this being a CDC training film.  The producers worked 'very closely' with the CDC in making this film, which accounts for much of the tameness.

This disease spreads rapidly throughout the world, killing many.  This would change everything.  But, about all you'll get when you watch this film is an epidemic of yawns.  It just didn't involve me.  It's important to identify with characters in order to care about what happens to them.  That didn't happen for me.  Sorry.",1315699200,4,2793,4.64344262295082
4601153,5,B0058N2SBS,"I'll just start by saying ""WOW!""  Sure, this movie had a legion of A-listers including an excellent director, yet still this movie exceeded my already high expectations.  While its pace was consistently somewhat slow, the content, in turn, was consistently interesting, socially revealing and gripping.

 This movie follows the outbreak of a novel and swiftly lethal virus from patient zero.  With a short incubation period, the highly contagious strain raises the CDC's concern readily ensued by the panic of the masses.  The medical community scrambles in a losing race against time as the numbers of infected and dead patients grow at a staggering pace.  Controversy, capitalism, distrust...all are likely products of slowly-solved epidemics.

 The cast flawlessly conveys the very best and worst of human qualities responding to a deteriorating society and economy.  Panic, desperation, fear and altruism are all tactfully delivered with humbling realism.  Adding to the already palpable emotions of the characters was the tension-setting music which, coupled with the concept of this movie, shall haunt my thoughts.  More than once I questioned how I would react in these situations.

  This gets a solid ""A+"" without question and I imagine that this will be an Academy Award nominee for set design and music, if not more.",1315699200,,1327,5.342995169082125
