2930958,1,B000V6LSNQ,i was disappointed that the characters were different from the original and not as good,1229385600,2,87,4.866666666666666
2930959,5,B000V6LSNQ,"I love the Munsters and having them ""drop in"" for Christmas isn't a bad way to celebrate.  Although this movie is not hosting the original cast it is still worth the time, money, and the laughs.  Grab a chair, some popcorn, and a snuggly monster to sit by the fireplace with you, and enjoy ringing in the holiday spirits with the Munsters!",1228003200,7,339,4.451612903225806
2930960,4,B000V6LSNQ,"Sam McMurray as Herman is likable (looking and acting alot like Fred Gwynne), although he is a little less energetic than Gwynne, who really threw himself into the role of Herman Munster. The jokes and plot resemble the old TV show, which is a good thing. The only cast member that doesn't really seem right for the part is Sandy Baron is Grandpa. He doesn't seem endearing and is stiff in the role. If they were to recast Grandpa and take out the few ""off-color"" jokes, this would be an above-par movie. As it turned out, the movie is still recommended and should be recognized for staying true to the original Munsters for the most part. None of the Munsters re-makes have equaled the original 1960s TV series, but it seems that there is a fondness for the original show in this movie. It doesn't feel like the filmmakers are just ""cashing in"" on the Munsters franchise, it feels like they are Munster fans too.",1204848000,19,913,4.539393939393939
2930961,4,B000V6LSNQ,"Just right for the Winter Holidays, except there was another Munters T.V. Movie which came out within a year of this one [as much as I enjoyed watching this, come on Universal make this a two movies in one disk bargain for f's sake]!!!",1198368000,,235,4.363636363636363

2930963,2,B000V6LSNQ,"My son loves the origninal Munsters - and I ordered this just for fun.  I knew it was not the original cast, but I still had reasonable hopes.  This was very disappointing.  While the actors did a good job of filling their roles - the story was much edgier than any other Munster show I have seen.  Santas elves were portrayed as selfish little horny brats, there were several instances of inappropriate innuendo, and there was foul language.  Had I known I would not have bought it for my son.  I don't think the original cast would have approved of what was done - I know I didnt.",1196812800,45,582,4.342592592592593
2930964,4,B000V6LSNQ,"Faring a little better than Edward Herrmann, but still no Fred Gwynne. Then again who ever could be? Sam MacMurray turns out a heartwarming childlike performance as he tries to bring the meaning and spirit of Christmas to his family. Especially Eddie. I will be picking this one up. And I hope they'll release the predecessor HERE COME THE MUNSTERS also. You know and I know nothing can ever come close to the original series. But at least their hearts are in the right place.",1187913600,38,476,4.6117647058823525

2930967,4,B000V6LSNQ,"This was purchased last year and the family never got around to viewing until now. When the Munsters hit the boob tube in the midsixties I was a youngster who loved anything Halloween in nature. So, I found this holiday flick to be endearing, yet, I could also see where some might find it a bit to campy. Released in 1996, acknowledging the passing of Fred Gwynne three years previous, I was wondering if one of the original cast would have a camo.

Too bad, but the actors, in particular Sam McMurray (Fred) & Ann Magnuson (Lily), came pretty close to capturing the vocal tones & body language of the originals. Sandy Baron, who played Grandpa, had previously appeared as Grandpas older brother Yorga in the threeseason series The Munsters Today (198891). Next, Elaine Hendrix played Marylin, but too my shame  what can I say beyond, what a pair of legs? And finally did anyone notice the actor who played Freds boss (Mr. Gateman) was Bruce Spence, the Gyro Captain from 1981s Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior?

If you ever enjoyed the original Munsters, you might want to check out the paperback The Munsters: A trip Down Mockingbird Land by Stephen Cox. Its a very interesting look behindthescenes. And finally, if you like a little horror with your Christmas, and on a much more adult orientated scale, I highly recommend the 2010 Rrated film Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale. Its a fantasy film made in Finland, and trust me, your Christmas will never be quite the same!",1481673600,2,1469,4.686046511627907

2930979,1,B000V6LSNQ,"My wife got this for me - I think she assumed this was the original cast, they did a really good job with the makeup, the sets are well done also - sadly the similarities to the original show end there.  The actor beneath the makeup brings too little life to the hulking head of the household, same goes for Grandpa (the nose...dear Lord... THE NOSE!!!)  The little guy playing Eddie isn't too bad, but Eddie never had much of a personality in the original show either.  Lily and Marilyn are played pretty well, but as a whole the acting in this made for tv disaster is just bad.  The writing is bad, the jokes are not funny and a few 'edgier' elements are added in an obvious effort to try and appeal to modern audiences.  About halfway thru I started fast forwarding when the kids weren't paying attention.  It was just too painful to watch.  This will probably get 'lost' in putting the Christmas stuff away.",1451520000,,911,4.419161676646707

How dare you sully the name of Herman Munster by ascribing it to a character so wholey unlike the true head of the Munster household. I could not watch 5 minutes of this mess. You cannot slap a bunch of pastel paint on a canvas and call it a Monet. You cannot stick a man in platforms and shoulder pads and call him Mr. Munster.,1421884800,2,399,4.194805194805195

But after a while, I enjoyed this movie on its own merits and was delighted to see the Munsters back in a holiday full length feature. Though made for TV, I thought the actors did a good job with the characters and my son absolutely LOVES this movie. In fact, he was inspired to create drawings based on the ""Toy making"" machine, using Herman's brain to help create the toys. It has a very cute plot and some hilarious moments, especially with the neighborhood house decorating contest. We have watched it several times already and this will be a regular holiday staple in our household.

2931114,4,B000V6LSNQ,"This is a cute little Christmas movie that does have some funny lines. The writers did try very hard to bring back the humor of the original series. Sam McMurray does a very good job imitating the late great Fred Gwynne as Herman. Ann Magnuson is a very good Lily Munster as well. Bug Hall seems a little too old to be Eddie but still he is a fine choice overall. My two disagreeeable cast choices are Sandy Baron as Grampa and Elaine Hendrix as Marilyn. Baron just does not have the looks or charm of Al Lewis. Although nobody can take Lewis's place, it's too much like watching grampa's relative rather than grampa himself. As far as Elaine Hendrix, I always thought she looks too much like a villain than the girl-next-door.
The story was actually written better than most of these TV movies based on old TV shows. The writers really do seem to create a 'labor of love' and truly were Munsters fans. The only real problem I personally had were the 'evil elves' of Santa even though they changed their tunes at the end.
All in all, if you are a Munsters fan you should enjoy this little film every year. It's the closest you can get to a Christmas episode of the original series. I would definitely recommend this movie for the whole family of Munster fans.",1352505600,2,1259,4.431034482758621

2931117,3,B000V6LSNQ,"If ""Munsters"" fans can accept the fact that this TV movie does not feature the classic cast of Fred Gwynne, Yvonne DeCarlo and Al Lewis, they might be entertained.  Sam McMurray has the impossible task of following Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster. Gwynne  is and always will be the definitive Herman. That said, McMurray does an excellent job, as does Ann Magnuson as Lily. The only major disappointment is Sandy Baron as Grandpa. Baron is much too low-key and Grandpa, therefore, is nowhere near the wild, wacky, and wonderful character immortalized by the incomparable Al Lewis. The movie manages to be fun, nevertheless. The Munsters, America's favorite family of fright, try to cheer up a seriously depressed Eddie  (Bug Hall) who, feeling like an outcast from society again, longs for an ""old-fashioned Trasylvanian Christmas.""
Santa Claus is trapped in Grandpa's labaratory and is accidentally transformed into a Christmas fruitcake! The ""Santa fruitcake"" is almost eaten as dessert by a shrill neighbor lady, who seems to be a direct descendant of the Gladys Kravitz character from ""Bewitched."" It's too bad that Santa's elves, Lefty and Larry, are mean-spirited and all too eager to cancel Christmas. Lefty even refers to Santa as a ""tub of lard."" The Munsters, of course, manage to make Santa human again and save Christmas.  Black- sheep Marilyn (an especially fetching Elaine Hendrix) even gets a handome boyfriend for Christmas.
  The DVD also comes packaged with a Bonus CD of Christmas carols, performed by an anonymous, bland male singer. My advice: Enjoy the DVD movie but throw the CD away.",1293580800,3,1605,5.106870229007634

Eddy seems down this time of year so Lily gets the family signed up for a neighborhood decorating contest and a family celebration to end all celebrations.

The ninety minute television film is light-hearted and amusing too. I wished there were special features about the movie like the making of the film or the series lasting influence and legacy. The film also included Mary Woronov as the competitive neighbor. Sam McMurray does fill Herman Munster's boots. The film is enjoyable and should be shown around holiday time.",1519862400,,938,5.090909090909091
