8693427,5,B00R041DWS,I saw a recommendation for Word World on a review from another parent on another N Circle children's dvd. So I decided to get a Word Wirld dvd for my 1.5 year old. He loves it and I feel like he may even be learning from the dvd. 4 episodes on the dvd. About an hour long dvd or close. Very entertaining and educational.  Only 1 episode is related to birthdays while the rest are normal episodes.,1476489600,,396,4.142857142857143
