8536074,5,B0016SN868,"The Crescent Moon is similar to other foreign films that deal with the hardships children go through, pain, neglect, abandonment. A child, Nan-na lives with his grandmother in a poor sea-side village, and soon his younger sister Ohgi arrives, adding more burden to the family.  By the time she is four, Nan-na has always been taking care of Ohgi, he feels burdened and embarrased by her as she has a hump on her back.  Nan-na is mean to his sister, telling her he will kill her if she doesn't do as he says.  He also makes her feel responsible for their hardship.

When the grandmother is forced to move to the city, her prospect for works is disrupted as she attempts to become a street vendor.  Also, in the big city of Seoul, the children's uncle leads Nan-na to a rich woman he said is their mother.  And here is where Nan-na intends to dump his sister.... to live with their mother.  When that does not work out, Ohgi is also put into an orphan's home, but Nan-na locates her and retrieves her.  But everytime he tries to get rid of her, he somehow rescues her again and again.

This film is considered very sweet and sad, and there are rough moments for a child, and more disheartening for an adult to watch this saddened little girl experience rejection and abandonment.  She is dearly loved by her grandmother though.  But yet, it is sad to see a brother treat his sister in such a cruel manner, but he redeems himself periodically.

The child actors give excellent performances, especially when Ohgi cries often, with huge teardrops rolling down her sad little face.  Their little faces reveal so much.

This is a lengthy film, with sadness, lonliness, suspense, and happiness.  Intermixed, it makes a great movie, suitable for younger children to watch.  Many people can relate to the children, their story is universal.  Excellent film!  Rizzo.",1353283200,,1855,4.672839506172839
