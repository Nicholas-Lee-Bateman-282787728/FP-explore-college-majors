7983686,4,B00008G64M,"Very funny DVD.  Lots of nice clean comedians I have never heard of before.  But it is well worth buying.  My copy of the DVD had a flaw at the end.  I could not hear the last comedian...which by the look of the audience was hilarious. Unfortunately, I didn't watch the DVD for months after I purchased it.  So, if you order this DVD, watch it right away.  If there is a flaw, send it back.",1312329600,,390,4.065789473684211
7983687,1,B00008G64M,"I bought this dvd for $9 for myself and my wife. We are Christians and like to laugh like anyone else; laughter is a good thing. However, ""Christian comedy"" seems to be an unattainable feat for most stand-up comedians. It usually involves futility and carelessness.

  In the beginning of this dvd, the actors played in a skit. At first, I thought the purpose was to spoof on secular comedy with its standard characters and dialogue. It seemed like they were going to say ""just kidding"" at any moment and show us what real Christian comedy is by their performances. This did not happen. They retained those overacted, stereotypical personas for the duration of the show. Their characters and jokes appealed to the lowest common denominators with subjects like ""stanky breath"". Nothing original here.

  It is a shame when people associate ""blackness"" with slang, poor grammar and certain catch-phrases and buzz-words. But this was a stronger dynamic than the ""Christian comedy"" theme advertised. I had to keep translating what they were saying into English for my wife.

  I looked on the web for reviews before buying this dvd. Most places just repeated what was on the back cover. But one place used the word ""irreverent"" in their description. I ignored it and figured it was just a non-Christian reviewer since secular media likes to use that word in reviews. But i think this show is irreverent, and irreverence is not a good thing.

  ""Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear."" (Hebrews 12:28)

  I like to laugh, but I don't laugh at everything. I won't laugh just because some ""comedian"" is dancing around on stage, laughing so hard at their own jokes that audience members think they are missing something if they don't laugh too.

  This dvd was not funny. I was embarrased by their topics. After about 15 minutes I started to fast-forward, then stop and listen, and then fast-forward again. Every time I stopped, it was the same.

  Just because the actors include church in their ""jokes"" does not make this ""Christian comedy"".",1166227200,2,2151,4.870523415977962
7983688,5,B00008G64M,"I watch the video and it was great. I could not believe how funny and perfessional it was. The comedians talked about real stuff that happens in church and life. I share is with friends and tell them to get a copy ASAP from AMAZON, Wal-Mart or Block Buster. It's a must have for you video/DVD collection. These guy are funny with out the bad language, Tommy Ford, Chucky, Small Frie, Chocolate and Darian are going to have you on the floor laughing. There is even a call the salvation at the end of the tape.
It's GREAT!",1067472000,,520,4.316326530612245
