The passion and ingenuity of these lowest of low budget film makers will leave you inspired and laughing and entertained. The most impressing part is how well they have grasped the essence of the work they are doing and how wonderfully they have adapted to the world around them. Most o the world may look at them like losers but in the end they come out winners who are just happy to be following their dreaming and creating happiness through the medium of their choice.",1387584000,,555,4.606060606060606
8399882,5,B003LXNKC8,"If you are a film maker who thinks you have it rough and you are thinking about giving up---Watch this film/doc.  If this doc doesn't make you feel like you can do anything with any medium you can get your hands on--You are an idiot.  Enjoy a real story about a film maker, cast, crew...etc.  with passion.  This is the passion that makes movies!",1385683200,,346,4.359375
8399883,5,B003LXNKC8,"Yes, this town is where I have seen a good part of my childhood. Mohan theater is one where I used to go in same way as shown in the movie. I belong to Hindu clan. Being a sensitive area, not many Hindus and Muslims hang together as said in the beginning. The only entertainment in the city (like any other cities) is watching movies, and have personally visited many video parlors. But not all city people have passion to go to the level where few of these people have.

I have always heard about movie making in Malegaon, and have been thinking to go and visit those people someday. That is why, the film is even more inspiring for me. Anurag Kasshyap has done exceptional job of bringing these people on real big camera and narrating their inspiring story. More kudos for giving those people their dues, basically putting their names in front of people and not taking all the credit (which he deserves). Anyone who watched slumdog millionair must watch this movie to get sense of what real India is. Slumdog millionaire was the worst way to depict India because those things never happens (or were highly exaggerated). This movie is pure story, nothing shown here is exaggerated. Many people share same dream and passion, and for that simple reason, this movie deserves 5 stars. A truly wonderful movie...",1341964800,2,1308,4.662337662337662
8399884,5,B003LXNKC8,"If you love films, and ever thought of making one , do your self a favor, watch this one. It follows the daily triumphs and disappoints of part time film makers, who are simply doing it for the joy of story telling. Dwells in to core of human need to tell stories, even though it means investing your money.",1292716800,,307,4.220338983050848
8399885,5,B003LXNKC8,"Shaik Nasir has never been to film school. His actors have never set foot in Bollywood.  He owns only a handheld camera and his budget is practically nonexistent. Yet these are merely details in his filmmaking endeavors, the latest of which recreates Hollywood's most beloved superhero franchise. Documentarian Faiza Ahmad Khan takes us along as she follows the turbulent yet hilarious course of Nasir's production. What Superman of Malegaon lacks in fancy special effects and celebrity appearances, it makes up for with ingenuity and spirit. Viewers will not be disappointed. Watch this film!",1279238400,2,593,5.376344086021505
8399886,5,B003LXNKC8,"In the small Indian town of Malegaon, where everyone's struggling with daily chores, a glimpse of happiness persists - love for films. The passion advances further than movie watching and the ambition of movie making emerges. The film documents a handful of local people trying to make their own version of the Hollywood blockbuster, Superman. The persistence and creativity of the ""filmmakers"" amaze, while the often comical situations amuse. A must see for every filmmaker!",1278892800,2,475,5.346666666666667
8399887,5,B003LXNKC8,"I remember when I saw this film with a packed house at the Third I Film Festival in San Francisco last fall. The entire crowd was hysterically laughing and guffawing.
This film looks silly and light-hearted, but it's actually a very well-crafted piece of work. The best Indian comedy of the year.
Supermen of Malegaon is slapsticky in the best possible way, and absurdly inspired. I highly highly recommend it to anyone who loves Monty Python, Benny Hill, Mr. Bean or Flight of the Conchords!",1277337600,,492,4.8
