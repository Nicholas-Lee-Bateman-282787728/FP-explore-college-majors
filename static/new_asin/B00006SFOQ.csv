8243579,5,B00006SFOQ,"I love this tape as much as the others. This is a great one for those days when you don't have the time for a strength training routine. It has it all built in, you use your own  resistance, but still get a great workout, combine this workout with the others and you will have a great total body workout. I do this tape about 3 times a week, it is a complilation of several great videos. If you are a Tae Bo video collector, you will have to have these. I have every Tae Bo video made, and I love them. This is a must have for anyone new to Tae Bo, you are gonna work but you are also gonna have a great time. And before you know it your gonna look great in no time at all. Enjoy!!!",1043280000,22,682,3.8368794326241136
