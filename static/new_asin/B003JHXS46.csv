8398158,1,B003JHXS46,"The first thing you notice about the film is the poor transfer quality as it appears to be an old newsreel with a very annoying soundtrack. Emanuela (Ornella Muti) gets a job as a secretary for an older married man at a firm where her dad works. He coerces her into an affair and she has trouble getting out of the situation once she meets a greasy journalist.

The film is a bad drama. The photo on the front of the DVD cover, plus the suggestive photo on the back have nothing to do with the film. The mundane picture of Muti on the phone does appear in the film.

Not worth the time to watch.

Guide: No F-bombs. Implied sex. Side breast stripper nudity.",1416873600,,657,4.24
8398159,2,B003JHXS46,"I was disappointed in Forbidden Passion.  From the box cover, I expected to see a nude Ornella Muti.  She keeps her interesting bits covered or off camera during this film.  It is the story of a young girl hired as a secretary to her father's boss, becoming his mistress, and earning the family a better apartment and more money.",1323043200,3,329,4.5423728813559325
8398160,2,B003JHXS46,"Looking at the box cover here you might be tempted, as was I, to think that this is a typical Italian softcore movie, with lots of sex scenes; not explicit, mind you, but at the very least the lead actress will be seen topless for long, lingering moments.  That is not the case.  The original title of this movie is, as seen in the opening credits, ""La segretaria"" (The secretary, or Cebo para una adolescente on IMDB).  It is an early drama with Ornella Muti.  The ""Editorial Review"" states: ""Seduced by a geezer, a stunningly beautiful girl feels compelled to marry a man she doesn't love just to abide by the family rules.""  The fact is that she's not forced to marry but rather to sleep with her married boss (also her father's boss) so that her family won't lose the privileges her boss gave them.  That's still well-placed for softcore face, but the near-nudity of the front cover never takes place within the confines of this film.  She kisses and is in bed with her boss, but the classic ""sheet up to the chest"" is in evidence.

** Spoiler Alert **
Now with all of those reasons why you shouldn't be deceived by either the summary or the front of the DVD cover, let me tell you what this *is*: it's a fairly flat drama about a young woman seduced and used by her boss, and her agonizing decision to stay with him so that her family won't be hurt by her unscrupulous boss.  Meanwhile, she falls in love with a young journalist.  Finally, she's able to escape the clutches of her boss, and her family isn't nearly as hurt as she'd feared.  There are some kissing scenes, and Ms. Muti is lovely (but largely covered) within them.  Largely forgettable, it's a shame that Mya Communication/Ryko felt the need to re-title this movie and use a deceptively provocative image of Ms. Muti, as it makes me suspicious of their other releases.  The summary on the back of the case isn't bad, though, and accurately depicts the action of the movie.",1307059200,13,1942,4.498575498575499
