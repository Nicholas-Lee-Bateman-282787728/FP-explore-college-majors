8052876,3,B0007WFUH4,"There are some nice shots of ""The Holy Land"" today and some interesting excavations to be seen. I noticed that since this program is chiefly made by Jews, they do tend to plug the Old Testament as fact (I've learned that there is no historical evidence of the existence of Moses and that there were no slaves in Egypt, simply because they weren't needed..that's right, not even to build the pyramids) and gently scoff at the New Testament. For example (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""There were more than 50 gospellers but the bible only uses four: Matthew, Mark, Luke & John. Thomas was totally ignored. There is one story where Jesus struck a young boy and killed him. Well, I can see why the compilers wouldn't want THAT fact known in their bible.""

I am not a religious person and I am not an atheist. I'm not even agnostic! I just don't care if there is a god or not, so I can watch this series with a relatively open mind. It struck me as a whole lot of Jewish folk pushing their barrel, albeit very gently (Note the ""Ten Commandments"" episode). Please don't pee down my leg and tell me it's raining, Abe!

All in all, it's quite entertaining... but there are better things out there. If you do watch it, take it with a grain of salt... no, better make that a pillar!",1281484800,5,1270,4.4
8052877,1,B0007WFUH4,This DVD is very deceptive in that it is only a total of 40 minutes of actual viewing time.  Not worth your time or money!!!!,1272326400,5,125,4.0
8052878,3,B0007WFUH4,"This DVD, in my opinion, was not up to the standards set by previous History Channel treatments of various Biblical subjects.",1253577600,12,125,5.0
8052879,1,B0007WFUH4,Deceiving buy. Not at all what I thought it would be. Different from what's written in summary. I was very disappointed. I just threw it away.,1232236800,18,142,4.5
8052880,3,B0007WFUH4,"I was disappointed by this documentary. Rather than spending the 45 minutes going into the true ""Secrets of the Bible"" this was actually a historical timeline of the archaeologists who research the Bible. Now it's true that some of these people are interesting, however the life and times of the archeologists is hardly what I would consider ""The Bible's Greatest Secrets"". The documentary itself was a little over the top, trying to force mystery and suspense when there was really very little said. I would hope that there are better documentaries out there on this topic. This is not one I would recommend unless your interest is in the bios of the archeologists.",1206057600,45,666,4.902654867256637
