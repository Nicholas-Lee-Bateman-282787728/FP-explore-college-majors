8173556,4,B000FVGNQE,"This is a very underground band from the 80s, reunited, playing NY's infamous CBGB during their 2003 tour of the States. Their sound is more OI! and rock'n'roll oriented than Discharge or Chaos UK, but they belonged in that crew back then. It features a 20-song gig and a dozen or so on the extras section, with great soundboard audio. They play the songs one after the other with little banter, and the sound is very even.

The box states proffessionaly filmed; what a laugh. It features only 2 camera angles; the frontal one is taken from the in-house camera, which is fixed (no zooming in), low-rez and looks like a very old VHS in SLP mode. You can see the whole band, but the taller members of the audience will block some of the visuals. The other angle is from a handheld camcorder and looks better, but nowhere near sharp. I watched this on a 27CRT TV, and it was barely OK.BTW  pic is old-school 4:3.

But did these quirks manage to ruin the experience ? Absolutely no ! The gig is an utter delight ! The guy with the camcorder didn't have any other place to shoot from than a tiny spot on the left side of the stage, and he, together with whoever edited the gig, made the absolute best with what they had at hand. During a couple of the songs, the camcorder guy sqeezed himself among the audience (second row) and managed some good takes, esp on the bassist, who hadn't been seen before. but most of the time he only managed to  shoot the drummer....and the back of the guitarrist and singer.

The CBGB stage is so small one wonders how was it that they thought they'd be able to shoot a DVD with so little, but they did pull it off. The edition is so good it paliates these shortcomings.

The sound is superb to boot; bottom end (drums and bass) is thunderous. I didn't even need to turn my sub on ! Guitar is clear and loud enough but has a kind of warm sound to it (as oppossed to trebley). The singer's vocals are a tad to high in the mix IMO, but the singalong choruses are fantastic. Guitar and bass are panned, with a tad more presence on the channel matching the visuals. All sweat and decibels; a real punk-rock gig !

Now the 2-hour extras section feature a lot of lame interviews and show the band driving through the States, but there are a dozen or so song performances with very good sound filmed in different venues, volume-normalized, that you can select from the menu.

This band totally rocks live, while their studio records never appealed to me.

Conclusion : great if you can get it used or from a bargain bin; I really enjoyed it to bits.",1501632000,,2570,4.348643006263048
