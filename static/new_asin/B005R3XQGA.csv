8484104,2,B005R3XQGA,"I love the Sax Rohmer Fu Manchu novels and was naturally interested in seeing the earliest sound film versions with Warner Oland. Unfortunately, these are seriously dated films that simply don't have the panache or the lustre of the later Karloff version. The film stock is hopelessly grainy and is guaranteed to promote serious eye-strain. This film and its sequel are for the FU-MANCHU COMPLETIST ONLY.",1363305600,6,404,5.136363636363637
