8345985,4,B001VC99EE,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the highest law enforcement agency in America, and arguably the most sophisticated in the world. Originally aimed at interstate crime, the FBI's mission now includes one of the most baffling and cruel crimes, kidnappings. THE FBI FILES brings you into the world of the FBI as it unravels some of the most puzzling and bizarre kidnapping cases in recent American history. Retired Special Agent and former Director in Charge of the FBI's New York Office James Kallstrom is your host in these true life crime dramas, taking you behind the scenes with re-enactments and interviews with the actual participants and victims.

I like The FBI Files, I think it's a very interesting show. This set is a good idea, putting 4 episodes about a similar subject (Kidnapping Cases) together on 2 discs. Each episode is 50 minutes long, and all four cases are very interesting. If you don't buy a lot of DVDs, or are not a huge fan of this show then I highly recommend this set. However if, like me, you are a real fan of the FBI Files then I suggest to keep your money and buy the full seasons, all four seasons are full of fascinating cases.

DISC 1
- Polly Klaas Kidnapped (season 1)
On October 1, 1993, 12-year-old Polly Klaas was abducted during a slumber party in her home. The FBI was immediately called in, setting off a massive, futile hunt for the missing girl. Agents using a laser light source discovered a palm print on Polly's bed, invisible to the naked eye, but few other clues. It took a stroke of good luck and determined investigative work to finally bring the murderer of Polly Klaas to justice.
- Family Secrets (season 2)
The December 1994 kidnappings of Joann Katrinak and her 4-month-old son, Alex. A young mother and her infant son are reported missing, and suspicion falls on her distraught husband. But without evidence of a crime having been committed, he is cleared and the mystery persists. Six months later, when a farmer discovers the murdered remains of the missing woman and her child, the pace of the investigation quickens. Can the FBI identify the killer from the minute evidence in the dead woman's car?

DISC 2
- Melissa Brannen (season 1)
When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the local police and FBI had a promising suspect: 24-year-old Caleb Hughes. There were no eyewitnesses to the abduction, but Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, never to be found. in a classic case of fiber analysis, the FBI gathers evidence to tie Hughes to the crime.
- Cat and Mouse (season 2)
The 1985 search for South Carolina serial killer Larry Gene Bell. In rural South Carolina, a cunning, sadistic predator was abducting and killing young women from their own yards in broad daylight, then taunting the victim's families by boosting and then dashing their hopes. Baffled local authorities called in the FBI, and in a deadly game of cat and mouse, putting FBI profilers and forensic examiners against the clever serial killer, the outcome was uncertain.",1335398400,,3083,4.824196597353497
