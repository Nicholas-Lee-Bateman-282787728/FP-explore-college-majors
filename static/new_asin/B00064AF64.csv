2166008,5,B00064AF64,"Howard Hughes was definitely one of the most fascinating and eccentric Americans from the last century.  This film does an excellent job of telling his story.  What's really great about this documentary are the interviews with some of the people who were really close to Hughes, like his best friend. It's great to hear their first hand accounts of the man and his life.  There's a ton of cool footage as well.",1102377600,24,410,4.666666666666667

8038345,5,B00064AF64,"I LOVED THIS DVD. I HAVE THE MOST RESPECT MR. HUGHES. HE WAS A MAN THAT WASN'T GIVEN THE RESPECT THAT HE TRUELLY DESERVED.HE WAS AND STILL IS THE REAL AVIATOR.HE LOVED FLYING.AND WATCHING THE DVD YOU WILL GET THE FEEL FOR THE PASSION JUST AS HE DID.HE WAS A HANDSOME, TALENTED MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANYONE THAT CAN COMPARE TO THE MR. AMAZING HOWARD HUGHES. IF YOU ARE A FAN AND INTRESTED IN LEARNING MORE ON HUGHES THEN START HERE THEN WORK YOUR UP TO HIS BOOKS. STARTING WITH THE ONE WRITTEN BY  MR.NOAH DIETRICH AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME PASSION AS HE DID FOR FLYING AND FOR MOVIES.. HOW COULD SOMEONE W/SO MUCH TALENT GET LESS THEN WHAT HE TRUELY DESERVES? BUY THIS DVD AND YOU'LL SEE EXCATLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.I AM A TRUE FAN OF HOWARD HUGHES.........",1171929600,,762,4.328671328671328
8038346,2,B00064AF64,"On balance, a downer. With all this material, fantastic film footage from Hughes' heyday, it was very disappointing to listen to the fake ""autobiographical"" memoirs, which were both imaginary and poorly imagined. Besides being delivered in a voice and manner which in no way appeared to match the features, character or speech of the real man. The film, and the accompanying bits and pieces, are still interesting in spite of this, but one was constantly aware of how very much better the whole treatment could have been. There has to be a much better and more genuinely understanding account of Hughes' life out there somewhere. What does come across is that Hughes was a very likeable man, who came to an extremely tragic end.",1167955200,,728,4.879032258064516
8038347,3,B00064AF64,"Wasn't completely blown away by the documentary. IF you are a fan of his flying and ground breaking aircraft production, then the footage on this DVD is worth buying.

I agree with the other review, the narration w/ the texan accent and over use of old timers soundtrack makes the THE REAL AVIATOR not a classic or must have.  If you are looking for tons of info about his death, vegas empire, etc then this DVD will not satify your appetite. The movie talks a lot about his life in aviation which made me buy it and watch it a lot.",1120608000,4,532,4.257425742574258
8038348,1,B00064AF64,"Not available in DD or DTS-I don't want it-I'm downloading it in stereo(I think)now, and will be burning it to DVD. Might even sell it!",1109635200,,135,4.44
8038349,5,B00064AF64,"The Scorcese film was great. But there is nothing like the real thing, the real footage, the real McCoy. Hughes was an incredibly interesting man and this film covers a lot more of his life than the Hollywood Blockbuster does. It's amazing that after all these years, those who were close to him are still brought to tears when recalling Mr. Hughes. I thought the actor did a great job expressing Hughes' feelings throughout his adventures. The interviews were moving and the editing seamless and concise. A must for biography collectors!

I highly recommend this DVD.",1107216000,22,568,4.916666666666667
