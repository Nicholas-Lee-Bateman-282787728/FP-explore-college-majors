Other than part 2, which discusses gun control policy and attitudes, most of the show was about how little is actually known about  what was going on with Adam and his mom.  If you are seeking information about what might have gone wrong in this situation, no insight is to be found in this production.",1451606400,,447,4.67948717948718

8566532,4,B00BCXW0OI,"There is a little bit more known about Adam Lanza than when this documentary aired but still surprisingly little. What the documentary does is cover well the bulk of the information which could be uncovered within the first year or so of his shooting and killing spree at the Connecticut Elementary School. We do get to see the entire town, the outside of the house, some of the school, and so forth plus meet with people around the town and with law enforcement who might be able to shed some light on what happened. The major person of interest to me was a guy who was Nancy Lanza's pal at the bar where she hung out.  He at least had a fair amount to say about the kind of person he had found her to be. He also knew about her trips out of town, away from Adam, with hopes that he would become a little self sufficient in her absence.  This was a forlorn hope. We also see the debate about gun control going on in the town.

Since this documentary aired, Peter Lanza, Adam's father, has been interviewed by the NEW YORKER. That extensive piece can be found online at the New Yorker website. Also, the investigative forces began releasing information to the public as well. Some of this includes the effort to find out what was wrong with Adam Lanza through the Yale Child Center.  He did see psychiatrists there and they were trying to help him. However, both he and his mother pulled out of treatment when he had side effects with one of the psychotropic drugs tried on him. This newer information also gives a much better picture of how ill he was.  His mental state had deteriorated so severely that he would only email his mother even though they lived in the same house.

So, yes, see this documentary, but then go over to the NEW YORKER website and read the interview with Peter Lanza.
