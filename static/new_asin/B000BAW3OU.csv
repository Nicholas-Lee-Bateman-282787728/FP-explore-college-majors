8530284,5,B000BAW3OU,"I had a hysterectomy 14 years ago.  Shortly afterward, I shot up to over 200 pounds.  I have bad knees and I found this video for sale at Blockbuster.  In six months, using this 3 times a week, I lost over 70 pounds.  The tape was old and I could never find it again.  I've only gained back 12 pounds in all of these years.  I can't wait to start using it again!!!",1332720000,2,364,3.9178082191780823
