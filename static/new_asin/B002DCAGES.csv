8365005,5,B002DCAGES,"I own more than couple of dozen of these Grandes Peleas dvds and this is one my of favorites! I really have enjoyed most of there Dvds but this one really stands out for a couple of reasons! First off the action is furious in each of the three great fights on this dvd and second the historical impact of these fights in the Batam and featherweight divisions. The Alexis Arguello vs Alfredo Escalara fight is the cream of the crop in this dvd. This fight took place 1/28/1978 the picture quality is great for that time period and the fighting is both skilled and fierce. Arguello looking poised as always slices up Escalaras face with his pinpoint power punches till Escalara had 4 or 5 visible wounds. That did not stop Escarala as he was very determined to get to Arguello. This was a battle for the ages with both men getting wobbled and bloodied. Howard Cossell calls this fight.(in English of course.).Next up is a Batamweight battle between two great southpaws Paul Banke vs Daniel Zaragoza. It is also an action packed fight as both men show alot of gritt and toughness. This fight is called by Ruben Castillo and Chick Hearn on the old aspn channel also in english. The last fight on the card is a 1996 fight and boxing after darks first main event. Marco Antonio Barrera vs Kennedy Mckinney is an awesome fight of a classic boxer vs boxer puncher. This fight had many exciting moments and a ton of skill and heart was shown by both men. This is the fight that put Marco Antonio barrera on the map. Roy Jones,Jim Lampley, and Larry Merchant call this fight. You can't find a much better deal anywhere for great fights at such a cheap price.",1342828800,,1648,4.4784053156146175
