8599469,5,B00DZL1FGE,"The story begins with the crown prince staying at a minister's home after a hunt and becomes smitten with his daughter, who is in love with someone else. However, the king decides he wants her as his queen so she runs away with her lover and is discovered and she is sent to court. Years later, she has a son, the king is about to die, possibly from illness, possibly from poison, and then the intrigue, the backstabbing, false accusations and executions escalate. Well acted, excellent period costumes, although there are some plot holes here and there.

Oh, yes, and the sex scenes are nice.",1473984000,,593,4.647619047619048
8599470,2,B00DZL1FGE,"The prince's obsession made the film interesting but there were so many questions that were never answered:
1- Why did the Emperor call the prince's mother his step mother but the prince called  the emperor his nephew?
2- Since the Emperor had a son, why did he have to choose an heir and why did his step mother's son (uncle/brother) become emperor instead of his son? (Remember the maid who became a concubine of the prince was trying to get pregnant with a son because his wife couldn't seem to get pregnant so obviously a son born out of wedlock could inherit)
3- The prince looked old enough to rule, why was his mother regent?
4- Upon the death of the prince, why did the concubine's son automatically become Emperor?
5- Why did the concubine get away with killing the Emperor?
6- Why did the concubine kill the Emperor? He would have ensured her son's safety and was easily led.  When she talked about doing anything for her son, I thought she meant she'd work the king.  Instead she kills him with a zillion witnesses at the palace and zero of her family (remember the old queen had them all killed) to back her.

I realize that due to the subtitles, much may have been lost. If anyone understood Korean and got the answers to these questions, I'd like to know; perhaps then I'd give it a better rating.  As I said it was interesting.",1473120000,,1342,4.461224489795918
