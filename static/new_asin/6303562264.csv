it follows Caruso, as he struggles for revenge against a merciless Little Junior, played by a menacing (and only halfway over-the-top) Nicolas Cage.

688993,4,6303562264,"""Kiss of Death"" is a great thriller from 1995. It is directed by Barbet Schroeder. And it is written by Eleazar Lipsky with screenplay by Ben Hecht. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin agrees to drive a truck of stolen cars as a favor to a friend. Whilst on the job he gets caught but refuses to role over on the others involved. Whilst in prison his wife is killed in a car crash and Jimmy leaves prison, bitter but with a determination to move on. However NYPD officer Calvin wants to use Kilmartin to get close to Little Junior Brown and get evidence to shut him down. This was one of several vehicles that was planned to turn David Caruso from a TV hit to a big screen star - as we know, it didn't work out that way. However the story is pretty solid, it doesn't break new ground and there's nothing outside of the usual crime thriller plot to surprise you but it's really quite good. At times it's a little dull because it is so straight forward but it's mostly entertaining. Caruso, for all his current lack of success, is actually very good. The problem is that he's good by doing the same ""NY Irish tough but fair"" role that he did in NYPD Blue, King of New York, Bodycount and most films he's done! It's good but I don't think he can do anything else. Jackson has presence as he always does and the support cast is really well filled out with people like Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci, Rapaport, Philip Baker Hall, Ving Rhames. Nicolas Cage's Little Junior is a mixed bag. At some points he is effective but for the most part he's horribly OTT and hammy. His character is full of ticks and eccentricities that at the end of the day that's all Cage has to do. Overall this is a solid thriller with no surprises. Caruso fans (like me) will like it regardless because it's Caruso doing his usual role. But others may not be so easily made to overlook the weaknesses.",1431993600,,1920,4.396067415730337

689062,3,6303562264,"Kiss of Death.  This stylish 101 minute 1995 crime thriller is based on the same story as the classic 1947 Hollywood  film noir of the same name.  It features an unusually star-laden cast, and, at a cost of $40 million, with returns of $14 million, was not judged a  success.

David Caruso plays Jimmy Kilmartin an ex-con, caught red-handed during a heist, who tries to distance himself from his past upon his release and lead an honorable life.  But he reluctantly agrees to help Ronnie Gannon, (Michael Rapaport), his loser cousin, with one last heist that goes wrong.  He refuses to rat out his underworld pals, but turns stoolie after they renege on their promises to him.  Coerced by Frank Zioli, (Stanley Tucci), an ambitious prosecutor, he agrees to play the pawn in a police plot to bring down Little Junior Brown, (Nicholas Cage), a psychotic gangster.  Helen Hunt plays Jimmy's wife Bev; Samuel L. Jackson plays Calvin Hart, an angry cop.  Ving Rhames plays Omar, a psychotic Philadelphia-based mobster.  Philip Baker Hall plays Big Junior Brown; Anthony Heald plays a fed.  Comedienne Anne Meara plays Bev's mother.

Not a bad cast, and by and large, well-acted.  As the lead, Caruso was very good at intensity and suffering stoically when receiving filmic punishment.  He was paid $1 M for this gig, which he squeezed in in the hiatus between the first and short-lived second season of the phenomenally successful television show NYPD Blue.  As many viewers will remember, he soon left the TV series in order to pursue a full-time film career, which failed to go anywhere.  He doesn't really carry this picture very well.  (Personally, I've always thought he was just too much of a skinny malink, as we used to say in Brooklyn,  to play substantial roles.)

In fact, the acting in the '95 film just doesn't compare to the '47 take.  Richard Widmark nabbed an Oscar for his memorable debut as the sadistic mobster; Victor Mature turned in star-caliber work as the two bit hood.  Brian Donlevy and Coleen Gray added heft.  Both versions were based on a story by Bronxite Eleazar Lipsky.  The '47 screenplay was by the near-legendary team of Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer, directed by Henry Hathaway.  The '95 version was by acclaimed Bronx, New York novelist Richard Price, no slouch at depicting the underworld, directed by the respected Barbet Schroeder.  Both versions well-written and -directed.  They transmit the look of the New York of their times; the less picturesque bits that tourists never see.  The newer is, of course, in color, while the older is in black and white, perhaps more suited to the city.  The newer version also has a lot more profanity, blood and gore, which, I guess, are not to everyone's taste.  Still, it's OK, but I expect demanding viewers had better stick with the original.",1382054400,3,2819,4.849056603773585

689065,5,6303562264,"David Caruso is one of those actors you have to love the way he portrays characters in his movies.. His portrayal of ""Jimmy Kilmartin"", a mob thief just wanting to lead an honest life with his wife, the love of his life, (played by Helen Hunt) and their baby. BUT..HIS COUSIN ""Ronny"" played by Michael Rapaport perfectly fits the part that make you want to hate him for destroying ""Jimmy's"" life.  You can't help but get emotionally involved with the characters, the story, and the struggles ""Jimmy"" has to go through. Buy it, pop some corn, open a soda, get some tissue and sit with your sweetheart while you watch it and I hope like me you watch it again at least twice for those rainy days to clear your emotions.",1326844800,,716,4.465648854961832

career slowly fade cause of type casting. Then KISS of Death comes along,
which fits his persona. The part and character suites him well, along with
Nicolas Cage and Samuel L. Jackson. This is a great action film, along with
good verses evil and government. For a great movie of a pawn caught between
the Government and the Mob, check it out. You won't be sorry!  Thank You",1290816000,,444,4.55
689068,4,6303562264,"I remember waiting with anticipation for this movie to be released on Friday April 21st, 1995. I saw the trailer for this, and they had the Chambers Brothers doing ""Time Has Come Today""; to me that's the ultimate freak out song, so I was expecting this to be extremely intense movie. I wasn't disappointed from the acting in the movie as Nicholas Cage and David Cauruso turned in stellar performances. The plot is actually better than the original as Cage plays a real sociopath....especially with the scene where one guy begins groping a dance girl because he was stoned drunk, and Cage gives the impression that he's going to burn the guys hand with a lit cigarette. I had to cover my eyes because of weak stomach, but then made him dance in his underwear I cracked up laughing because it was just too hilarious, and I was still thinking the hand was going to get burned.

Well anyway this flick is about a criminal that is trying to stay on the straight and narrow after being left out of prison, but his cousin talks him into one more crime as he's in trouble. However, things do not go well, and the criminal ends up back in jail. His family is torn apart as his wife is killed in a car accident, and it was his cousin's fault. The criminal is released from prison, and is confronted by the police officer played by Samuel L. Jackson who arrested him, and wants him to bring donw the crime family. There's non-stop thrills, and tons of good crime drama here including a classic fight between Cage's and Cauruso's characters. With all the good things I put on here you would think that I would give it 5 stars, but as I said there's one little thing missing, and I sat through the whole movie right down to the credits to hear ""Time Has Come Today"", and it never came. I guess I'm asking for too much here, but I really feel it would've made the film even better.",1251244800,,1867,4.395953757225434

689071,4,6303562264,"David Caruso, as Jimmy Kilmartin; ex-hood, ex-felon was great. Showing that post-""NYPD"" and pre-""CSI: Miami"" demeanor. All the while being pushed around by the cops (Samuel L. Jackson as Calvin), almost killed by ""Little Junior - B.A.D.,"" played by Nicolas Cage; psycho-hood son of father gangster ""Big Junior"" (what else!) played by Philip Baker Hall.

Jimmy goes to prison, but before he's released 3 years later; his wife (Helen Hunt) is run over (in a drunken stupor). Then, his cousin is killed by Cage for screwing up. Jimmy ends up marrying Rosie, played by Kathryn Erbe in her pre-""Law And Order - Criminal Intent"" days. She's a real ""looker"" in this one.

An undercover fed (Ving Rhames) whom Jimmy meets, is assassinated by Little Junior, in his presence. The Feds want Junior's hide, but he ends up ""walking."" If you've watched a lot of movies with state and federal authorities screwing each other and not sharing information (Stanley Tucci - the prosecutor, among the many), then you'll know why Cage walks.

This is going to take too long, so please read ""long-winded"" reviews for complete storyline.

Anyway, the movie is short enough but replete with the many cliche'd ""good guys vs. bad guys"" mannerisms and confrontations that have been overdone in so many movies that... well....they're done in this one.",1222473600,,1323,5.0

Nicolas Cage is a ruthless gangster who stops at nothing in his evil ways, while Caruso is an ex-con that gets pulled back into trouble.  I thought Caruso did a very good job of acting and I'm not a fan of his.

Other stars include Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci and Michael Rapaport.

689153,4,6303562264,"Based on the colossal and unbeatable homonymous film of 1947, Schroeder seems to be more interested to remark the personal double tragedy experienced by Caruso, jailed and widow in the first the third part of the movie and his painful redemption to fight against the bureaucracy and try to convince the gang headed by Junior and Omar.

Helen Hunt despite her brief performance, gets involve us with her undeniable talent and charisma. Stanley Tucci shone as the implacable agent behind the traces of Kilmartin. This is the actor that (in my personal opinion would have reached the peak performance as Gerard Lieutenant in The Fugitive despite the fact Tommy Lee Jones won the Oscar). Tucci has been underestimated by most directors in films like this. Imagine a film with Tucci and  Chezz Palmitieri together in a mob movie. Well there is still time to do it.

Nicholas Cage looked extremely overacted, Vig Rhames is far to convince too. These two performances demerit the dramatic balance of the film, pitifully. I know the comparisons are hateful but please, watch the gradual transformation of emotions experienced by Al Pacino in previous films such Godfather II , Carlito 's way or Donnie Brasco, for instance. The rage must emerge gradually through a wide number of emotion layers.",1126742400,4,1287,5.0046728971962615

As a poor country boy unfamiliar with the urban crime cliches and plot twists, I  can honestly say I enjoyed this movie.  No, it's no masterpiece, but it is  entertaining enough to be worth seeing, even buying at such a reasonable  price.  Caruso and (as they all admit) a fine supporting cast do very well  with a now conventional plot that is at least not as droll as they say.  This is probably the first time I've rated something higher than others.  Strange.",960940800,8,604,4.4495412844036695
689156,3,6303562264,"When David Caruso made headlines by leaving the hit TV show ""NYPD Blue,"" the question people were asking was ""Is he making a mistake?"" Looking back on his career the past few years, we have to say that he did. But you couldn't tell that from his performance in ""Kiss of Death."" He's actually quite good.
Caruso plays Jimmy Kilmartin, a reformed car thief with a wife and baby who is desperately trying to go straight. Before he does, though, he reluctantly agrees to help his worthless cousin Ronny (Michael Rapaport) on one last run. If he doesn't, then Little Junior (Nicholas Cage), a sadistic killer, will bury Ronny. Naturally, things go bad. A cop gets shot and Jimmy ends up taking the fall by himself.
True to his personal code of honor, Jimmy won't rat out the others no matter how hard the sleazy DA (Stanley Tucci) pushes him. Then Ronny starts to move in on Jimmy's wife (Helen Hunt) and things really go wrong. Jimmy agrees to make a deal and cunningly manipulates events so that Little Junior takes Ronny down.
Three years later, Jimmy finally gets out of prison. The DA's not about to let things drop, however. He wants Little Junior bad and he'll do what it take to get him, even if that means using Jimmy and his family.
The plot of ""Kiss of Death"" is loosely based on the 1947 original-a class film noir-which featured Victor Mature, and Richard Widmark in his star?making role. (Remember his maniacal giggle as he pushed the old lady down the stairs?)
The story's been updated and it is grittier, realer and even more gripping. Novelist Richard Price (""Clockers"") wrote the screenplay and he is one of the very best writers working in movies today. He has a true affinity for the seedy side of life and the characters and situations that populate his films are always enthralling to watch.
The direction by Barbet Schroeder (""Reversal of Fortune"") is tense, well?paced and energetic. The acting is very good, especially by Caruso and Cage. Caruso is a very subtle and contained actor, much like Robert Mitchum, a veteran of many films noir. Also like Mitchum, Caruso seems like a powder keg about to go off. He projects seething fire and intensity without overplaying his hand.
Cage is mostly known for his dimwitted nice guy, hero roles, but he shows here that he has some real chops, creating a maniacal thug with a hair?trigger temper. With his pumped?up body and goatee, he has a hard look that goes great with his intense persona. It would have been very easy to go over?the?top with this part, but Cage never does. This is a very good performance.
The ending is the weakest part of the movie. It seems that the filmmakers ran out of gas and had to settle for less than the picture deserves. This is not a great crime film like ""Goodfellas"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it still makes for an enjoyable viewing.",960854400,22,2828,4.635458167330677
