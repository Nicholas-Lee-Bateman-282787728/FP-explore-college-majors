6493535,2,B00LNFXKTE,"Visually I should rate it 5 stars, fantastic video of fantastic scenery and fishing.  But as a whole the narrator's voice really detracts.  I can't decide if the dialogue is spoken much too softly or if he has a slight speech impediment.  Or is it the lack of sufficient volume when the sound track was added to the video?  No matter, the narrator is very hard to understand and much too soon the video becomes very boring, more annoying than entertaining.  I tried to like this video because I do a little fly fishing but after 3 attempts to watch it I am not able to enjoy it.",1432684800,,578,4.314814814814815

6493538,5,B00LNFXKTE,"Absolutely one of the most visually beautiful and enticing videos my husband and I have seen in a long time. We started fly fishing about 3 yrs ago when our son was in college in Montana and would  go wherever he was dong his mining internships. Needless to say we had some incredible fly fishing experiences on the Madison, Yellowstone, Jefferson, Clark and Gallatin rivers. Now I am whimpering to go fish all over Idaho on Hwy 20! But my husband wants me to say "" Don't bother buying it!"" so no one catches ""our"" fish and vistas. To future ""fish-ons""!!",1426377600,2,554,4.485148514851486
