2839017,3,B000QGZECC,"pretty good arm workout, but only one ab move and two lower body moves. Her fat burning dvd is a fantastic cardio workout, so that one i would highly recommend!",1355529600,,160,4.366666666666666
2839018,3,B000QGZECC,If you are a beginner and you are really out of shape this video will work just fine. If your in good shape find another video. I have many of her old vhs exercise tape and she says the samething in each video. The first time I watch I knew exactly what she was going to say. Overall I like the workout dvd,1343260800,2,306,3.873015873015873
2839019,5,B000QGZECC,"This video is basic; warm-up, arms (biceps, triceps, shoulders), legs (glutes, hamstrings), and abdominal followed by fairly thorough stretching.  You can use any weight (2-25lbs) and these are deep, concentrated movements, slowly resisted both ways.  I can't say it leaves my muscles sreaming, but it is excellent for getting reaquianted with seldom used muscles. A+++ for beginners.",1299542400,11,384,5.719298245614035
2839020,5,B000QGZECC,"I have many of the Susan Powter exercise lines, some going back to the early days of the 1990's. She is the best person for truthful health, exercise and diet facts. Although she has changed over the years in her personal life, her teachings are the same sound advice she was informing us of all these years. Just when I think I have bought everything she has ever made, I find something new/old.",1294963200,6,396,4.438356164383562
2839021,2,B000QGZECC,"Okay, I got this because when I saw it, I got really curious about what kind of workout Ms. Stop the Insanity would put out.  Each exercise is 3 sets of 10. There are 5 exercises, I think. The biggest problem was that the ""upper body"" part was just arms, no chest or back. The ""lower body"" part was just glutes (you target just glutes by doing 2 different leg lifts with ankle weights). And the ""abs"" part was just regular crunches, no crunch variations or planks to work upper, lower, middle, obliques, or the whole core. All you're really working is upper abs. It would have actually been a good workout if she had done some compound moves to work the whole body in 30 minutes. The set was nice, her demenor and presentation were good. I'm just disappointed in the exercises chosen. Or the lack of exercises.

This is NOT a cardio workout. The previous reviewer who said it was a good cardio workout must have been reviewing the wrong workout. It is a pure weight workout with a gentle cardio warmup on the step.",1291075200,13,1014,4.4171122994652405
2839022,5,B000QGZECC,"This is good workout because you can do it if you are at the beginner level or advanced.  The great thing about Susan is that she know's what it's like to be overweight, so she has modifications for those people who are just starting out.  You can use a step or not, you can lift your knee or not.  I'm advanced so I choose to add some plyometric moves and lift my knee high, but you can go slow and still see results.  If you are out of shape and haven't worked-out in years, I highly recommend this DVD to get started.  It will be an easy 30 minutes of good cardio, mostly walking and steping.  This really healps me stay in shape and is easy on my joints.  In fact, Susan's work-outs are so low impact you can do them barefoot.  I love it!",1282003200,3,742,4.068965517241379
8196430,4,B000QGZECC,"Moderate full body workout great for beginners. 6 minute warm up with step, arms with light weights, legs with light ankle weights, then crunch routine, and cool down. You feel good after doing it.  Format and style of editing is a bit annoying. She is not as genuine and passionate but still easy to listen to and  knows how to make you want to stick with her.",1499212800,,361,4.373134328358209
8196431,5,B000QGZECC,I really liked her earlier strength training workout. Lean Muscle Mass is very doable!,1466640000,,86,5.214285714285714

8196434,5,B000QGZECC,35 minutes and you will sweat!  good strength building.  we have a lot of dvds and this is one of our favorite short workouts.  would love to get one of hers that is a little longer,1460332800,2,181,3.9722222222222223

8196436,5,B000QGZECC,"I liked this DVD well enough to order Volume 1. Losing muscle mass is a problem for older people. It is practically impossible to lose weight being female and over 50 without resistance work of some kind. Being 62 and female this is what I needed. I love Susan Powter--She ""walks the talk""having lost 130 pounds keeping it off. She keeps it simple and to the point. There are wild moves or fancy footwork to keep up with. I have some of her workouts on VHS tape & really was hoping to find the same work outs on DVD.I started working out with this dvd a few days ago. I think the weight repetitions are just about right for someone on the go but I feel the stretching and shakeouts between sets for the upper body arms- could be a little longer. I say this having had tendonitus in the elbow from weight lifting a few years ago. It is Three Sets of 10 Repetitions for each exercise. This workout requires the use of a small step, yoga mat, smaller dumb bell weights up to 25 pounds. Shoes are optional. I like the format, You can select to work a certain body part or do the whole thing. I don't particularly care for the back ground music, but I felt I can shut the sound off and provide my own music later if I would choose to do so. This DVD isn't for body builders. No it doesn't provide all of the exercises for building muscle in every body part, but it is adequate to allow for building lean mass. I would recommend it. I will add more commentary in a few weeks.",1445299200,5,1469,4.19434628975265
8196437,5,B000QGZECC,"This work out is fun..I actually got results in about 14 Days. It is gentle. Nothing cazy that I could not keep up with.

8196438,5,B000QGZECC,"Susan has still got it, this DVD is a good workout that anyone can do and get into shape.  Very pleased.  ; D",1407369600,3,109,3.6956521739130435
8196439,1,B000QGZECC,"Susan you need to cut out the chatter. Make a way to view the DVD without all of the noise. I couldn't get pass the on going noise.
The older DVD fitness tapes were more of a workout video.",1371427200,2,189,3.871794871794872
