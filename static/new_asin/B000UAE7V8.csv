8212671,4,B000UAE7V8,"As an old fan of MP, I already knew that I would definitely enjoy this product. It was a pleasant surprise to ""reunite"" with the Melrose gang after more than 10 years from the time I faithfully watched them on TV.
The only thing that, in my opinion, could use a bit more work was the rest of the pack's features, such as the subtitles (or more exactly the lack of any) and the bonus stuff which I found quite poor actually. Good thing that, although I'm Greek, my English is fluent so I had no problem keeping up with the dialogues but it would have been welcome to have the english subtitles on so that I wouldn't have to bend my ear for every word spoken!
To international fans who are not extremely acquainted with the English language this might be a problem...other than that, I totally recommend this pack to MP die hards!",1210032000,,828,4.348387096774194
8212672,5,B000UAE7V8,"The true TV-symbol of the nineties Melrose Place is a show, which plot twists, intrigues, black humor & sexuality threw the viewers right into the breathtaking world of its characters & completely sucked them up emotionally & mentally.  No other show will ever be equal to Melrose Place in its passion & unpredictability! This is undoubtedly the best show ever & all seasons of it are a must have in your home DVD collection!",1201651200,,425,4.743243243243243
8212673,5,B000UAE7V8,"Melrose was the hottest nighttime soap of the 90's. It just kept getting better and better and more outrageous and over-the-top with each passing season. Remember, you are what you watch :-)
