8234143,4,B000YV1XFG,"These are three really good Harlequin movies.  Remember, you can preview these movies when they come on Lifetime.  Like the books they are a good watch.  Here are the titles of the movies and what it says on the back to help you decide if you want to make the purchase.

Recipe for Revenge
Carly witnesses TV star Chester Winnifield murder her friend and her friend's date.  She tells Detective Brannigan, but Winnifield has an alibi and Carly finds herself in hot water.

Hard to Forget

Treacherous Beauties

8234144,5,B000YV1XFG,"I am very happy with delivery of those DVD's. Recipe for Revenge could've been edited better (can see the breaks for commercials). Overall, I am happy with the delivery and the movies.",1220745600,,184,4.78125
8234145,5,B000YV1XFG,"This product was received on time and in excellent condition.

This product was enjoyable and did not contain anything that I would not want my children to see. Some of the romance videos contain content not suitable for children. That was not the case with this one.",1218499200,,267,4.680851063829787
8234146,5,B000YV1XFG,Treacherous Beauties is my favorite of the Harlequin 12 that are out and it is included in this set of 3. All three movies are mystery romances with good endings. Great watch on a cold rainy or snowy day. Buying them in the set is a really good buy. I would recommend all 4 volumes to complete the set of 12 that is out. All the movies have been shown on the Hallmark Channel.,1217289600,,376,4.094594594594595
8234147,5,B000YV1XFG,Wonderful item.  Received quickly and well packaged.  Enjoyed the DVD and would order more if available.,1215388800,,104,5.4375
8234148,2,B000YV1XFG,"I saw these movies on the WE channel some time ago and really enjoyed them so I was happy to see them on DVD. I realize that TV edits movies so I checked the ratings before I bought this and found it was NR. Hoping for the best, I made the purchase. I was glad I watched Treacherous Beauties without my kids because there was one scene that contained a lot of nudity that ruined the whole movie for me. In addition, this particular movie kept looping back to one scene and I had to go to scene selection to get out of it.  The other two movies were fun and just as I remembered from TV with only a few extra scenes. I will be disguarding the movie Treacherous Beauties and hope it comes on TV again so I can record it.",1206748800,5,718,4.020979020979021
