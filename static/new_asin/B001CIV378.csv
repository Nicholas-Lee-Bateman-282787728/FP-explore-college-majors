8287869,5,B001CIV378,"Wow! Machines are working extremely hard to make sure that the snow does not block the streets or pile too high. It is a lot of hard work, but somebody has to go through it. And if the truth be told, as long as a machine can be used, I would probably help out if I were part of the staff. Those machines in this program are extremly ingenious! Without them, those tasks would require many humans. Great work Mighty Machines.",1314576000,,424,4.246913580246914

8287874,5,B001CIV378,"All of these DVDs are great.  We've got them all!
They're 90 minutes long, and my nephew can't get enough of them.  He literally runs around the house singing ""Mighty Machines"" from the theme song...it's pretty cute.  He learns quite a bit about the different types of machines, and he's really into all of the action.  This one is perfect for winter!  Definitely recommend!",1226620800,2,374,4.78125
