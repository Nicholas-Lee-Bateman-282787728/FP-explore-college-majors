4509050,3,B004ZJ9VXY,"You're parked in the back row of the Drive-In for a triple feature date night. It is 2:00 am and very bright lights come on; the movies are over. You fumble around, throw the speaker on the ground, drive out as fast as you can and again . . . you have absolutely no idea what that third feature was all about. You read on the marquis: ""Female Aliens in Nebraska"" or some such title.

Now here is a collection of 50 those ""Movies"" that you were too ""preoccupied"" to watch then. You didn't miss much. There is a reason why they were third . . . and you'll find out why.

But it's a great trip down memory lane; well worth the price. And if you never heard of the Drive-In, you're in for a special treat. Watch these ""movies,"" laugh hard and just try to think of why Grand Ma or Grand Pa can't remember them.",1323043200,66,805,4.0886075949367084

4509054,5,B004ZJ9VXY,"I'm retired now and have plenty of time to waste, so that's why I bought this set, plus a walk down memory lane. This stuff is so shockingly bad it makes me question the human race. I had to continually slap myself to stun me back to reality, as too much viewing will require a psychologist.  For some time now I felt like I lost my sense of humor, but these movies brought it back. I cannot remember the movie title I saw, but it was one I went to see at the drive-in when in high school. The problem is that I never saw the ending as me and my buddies ""Blacked-out"" and never remember the ending.(too many Colt 45s). My favorite so far is ""The Creeping Terror"". It's so pathetic that is why 5 stars. I'd rather watch this insanity instead of the crap on tv nowadays. Now time for my therapy session..",1495411200,12,802,4.174193548387096

He is able to remove his right eyeball and set it to record who is going in an out of a suspected drug dealer's building and retrieves the eye and it shows him the events that took place and he learns who is supplying heroine to addicts.

Some are hilarious, others painful to watch , but, you can have a ball when there's nothing to do by getting your 20-something to sit and watch the corny ones.

I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!

Hands of Steel, which is the Terminator rip-off on this set, is actually one of my favorite films on this collection.

  I enjoy having these on tap for when I have done my house cleaning on a day off or when there are a ton of re-runs.  Galaxina is hilarious.  Slipstream is out there but nice.

Don't get me wrong, though, there's plenty awful pictures just waiting for you and your friends to ridicule, but there's a few decent surprises as well.

There may be some unintended laughs provided by a few moments in these movies but I think I would rather spend my time and money on better quality.  Yes, there are some very enjoyable sci-fi movies from the past.  I don't think they are in this collection.
There are bad sci-fi movies like The Crawling Eye and Robot Monsters.  And there are better bad sci-fi's like This Island Earth.  And then the good sci-fi like Day The Earth Stood Still.  Lots of movies in these categories are available.
I bought this collection hoping to find a few gems.  Perhaps I will.  And if I do I will redo this review.  So far I have seen technical and cinematic stuff not worth much.  I am sorry to be so negative, I do see that others are getting enjoyment from this collection.  I WILL redo this review if I see reason(s) to.

Since the collection arrived, I've looked at the transfer quality for the first 80% of the movies. They are about VHS quality, which really shows in a projector setting. After all, when 4 movies are put on a single side of a DVD, quality is NOT a top priority and it shows.

Most of these movies I've never heard of before, but a few have interesting premises. A mix of SciFi and Fantasy movies are included. It appears that most from the 1980s were shot on video (cough, cough).

4509150,5,B004ZJ9VXY,"I'm hooked on these 50-movie Mill Creek/Treeline dvd sets. I own 14 and plan to own many more! They are an unbeatable mix of the unexpected, the silly, the rare, and the hilarious. These are bad movies - possibly the best/worst of the bad movies - all at once, mixed up in a bucket, about 4 movies for $1.

Yes, the video quality is mixed. Yes, most of these seem to be transferred from VHS sources. Yes, some movies are edited, and yes, sometimes the sound quality isn't ideal. If any of this bothers you, do not buy a 50-movie pack. You will need to pay a little more for individual dvds.

""Sci-Fi Invasion"" is one of my favorites! Plenty of bad, laughable, colorful, and genuinely bizarre movies. Overall the movies are newer than the ""Sci-Fi Classics"" set, mostly color, mostly '60s-80s. A few made-for-tv things. A couple films that don't belong. Lots of personal writing, bad acting, desparate production, and cheap effects. Lots of stuff that is simply hard to believe!

""R.O.T.O.R."" is a comedy, sort of, about a murderous robot traffic cop. ""Morons From Outer Space"" is a great comedy from the British duo Smith & Jones (RIP to the great Mel Smith). ""Prey"" is a moody portrait of a morose lesbian-eating alien. ""Hundra"" is a passionately pointless movie about a woman warrior who Needs To Mate, and ""Future Women"" shows women taking over the world with eyeliner, wigs, and lots of writhing. I might be wrong, but I think ""Alien Factor"" was an inspiration for ""Tom Goes To The Mayor"". ""Horror High"" feels like a Troma film. ""The Day Time Ended"" is a fluffy vision of brainless '80s heaven. A few Italian films bring eyeliner and Euro style to outer space. A wealth of cheap effects, rubber monsters, implausible writing, appalling acting. And much more. Endless fun.

Have a Klaus Kinski double feature! In ""Star Knight"", which simply must be seen to be believed, he plays an alchemist helping a space alien woo a princess against the efforts of an abbot played by Fernando Rey and a knight played by Harvey Keitel (with a thick Brooklyn accent). In ""Primal Impulse"", Klaus is the malevolent and possibly imaginary evil overlord controlling a doomed space mission, as seen in the dreams of an amnesiac Italian woman. Ah, Mill Creek.

Not too many truly ""good"" films, excepting ""Brother From Another Planet"" which is terrific. Not many famous faces either. But there are so many strange and silly worlds to look at! Some are gory, and some are at least PG-13 so this is NOT a set for young kids.

There are some repeats here from other Mill Creek sets: ""Hands Of Steel"", ""The Bat"", ""Creeping Terror"", ""War of The Robots"", ""Manster"",  ""Night Fright"", and probably others. Look at the listing before buying.

Did not expect art, but did expect some entertainment, even if the campy or nostalgic kind.  Unfortunately, these are unknown, mostly incredibly poor, dubbed Italian color films and made-for-TV-movies from the 1970s and early 80s that do not have even the charm of having been from another era, many with production or print values so low that they could not be shown even on early-morning television today.",1383696000,2,773,4.984496124031008

4509162,5,B004ZJ9VXY,"You never know what you'll find in these 50 movie packs. It's doubtful anyone buying these collections have seen every movie in them. You will find a lot low budget thrills but you may find some genuine gems like the movie in my subject title, Primal Impulse aka Footprints on the Moon. This movie is a lost mid 70's Italian psychological thriller which has subtlety to it's tension. Reminds me of slowly pressing your thumb down on a surface until either the surface or thumb ultimately gives way in the end. That's everything a solid thriller should do. I'd also like to point out that this appears to be the only NTSC domestic DVD of this movie. It's a shame that it's buried in a generic collection.

The other movies are all over the ballpark and that includes the visual quality of the movies. Welcome to Blood City has horrible pan and scan with a terribly chopped picture while Galaxina is presented with great picture and a widescreen.

Just a note of warning. It's true that there is some redundancy with these Mill Creek sets when it comes to movie selection in their collections. It's also true that while the title remains the same, the list of movies sometimes change. This mightn't be true with Mill Creek specifically, but it does happen with certain makers of these collections. It's best to buy these direct from Amazon instead relying 3rd Party Sellers. Reduces the chances of getting an older obsolete release without an updated movie list in the collection. This happens because some prints of movies fall in and out of print meaning their copyright protected.

Definitely worth it if you're a fan of 1970's era European thrillers.  Also worth it if you like low budget sci fi with a few peasant surprises mixed in among those titles as well.",1371513600,2,1763,4.6957928802588995

4509164,3,B004ZJ9VXY,"I bought this for ""The Crater Lake Monster"" (Dave Allen Fx) which I read about in a fanzine in the late 1970s but never got to see and for ""Night of the Blood Beast"" which I saw once as a kid during its original release (Mom and Dad took us kids to the drive-in in the 1950s for movies like ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"", ""4 Skulls of Jonathan Drake"", ""Earth v the Flying Saucers"", ""1984"", ""The Alligator People"", ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"", etc). Also I heard about the ""Manster"" the monday at school from kids who saw it the weekend of first run (I didn't) so I always wondered what I missed.

Transfer quality varies film to film. ""Crater Lake Monster"" is clean. ""Night of the Blood Beast"" is worse than my transfer to DVD from VHS of movies I originally recorded from cable for personal watch/archive. However, I have bought worse low budget commercial DVD transfers that that.

A lot of these movies don't have Wikipedia articles but from those that do:

""Hands of Steel"" is the Italian film ""Vendetta dal futuro"" (Vendetta From the Future) also called Fists of Steel and Atomic Cyborg.

""Star Knight"" is the Spanish film ""El caballero del dragn"" or ""The Knight of the Dragon""

""Extraterrestrial Visitors"" is aka ""The Pod People"", the original Spanish title was ""Los nuevos extraterrestres"" or The New Extraterrestrials.

""War of the Robots"" was released on DVD as ""Reactor"", Italian title ""La guerra dei robot""

""Top Line"" aka ""Alien Terminator"" aka ""Das Geheimnis des Azteken-Berges"" which I think is Ghosts of the Aztec Mountains.

""Night Fright"" was released in UK in variations off ""The Extraterrestrial Nastie"" (""...Nasty"" and ""E.T.N."")

""Escape from Galaxy 3"" is aka ""Starcrash II"" but is not a sequel to ""Starcrash"" nor is there an ""Escape from Galaxy 2"" nor an ""Escape from Galaxy"" :) the original Italian title was ""Giochi erotici nella 3a galassia""

(I may complete this later.)

A lot of foreign made movies got different English titles no relation to original title, but a lot of drive-in movies got retitled during release after reviews and word-of-mouth poisoned their box-office potential.

4509168,4,B004ZJ9VXY,"Mill Creek Entertainment is a great company for video geeks like us. They have fifty movie packs (and others) dirt cheap. I look at it this way; I buy one of these fifty packs for fifteen bucks (sometimes cheaper), and if I see a movie I really like, I can go out and track down the best copy available. Mill Creeks movies are mostly public domain and sometimes they get rights to certain films, or catalogs of films. (The Crown International Films are licensed by mill creek at the moment.)

Now the transfers on these fifty packs aren't always the best. You'll run the gamut from great to horrible all in one fifty pack, and that's why I've started to review these packs. I'll be putting a short synopsis of the film followed by an excellent to poor rating of audio, visual and I'll also state if it's widescreen or full-screen, and color or black and white. Some movies repeat in different sets. I think I may have four or five copies of The Bat on different sets, but the price of the packs make it still worthwhile to pick up a set even if you're only going to get twenty or so new movies out of a fifty pack.

I'd like to state again that these sets are excellent starting points to find movies you might be interested in getting a better copy of later, exploring a genre you're not familiar with, and at the very least, getting a bunch of movies that might never see another DVD release besides the one in these sets. Besides the reviews here, I also recommend going to Amazon and looking at the reviews there. Some kind people have put in the scores for each movie from the IMDb, and some go as far as to write down which movies are repeated in other sets. A valuable resource.

Another note about the Mill Creek company is that their customer service is excellent. I've had troubles before with the discs, or the cases, and each time they've sent me replacement copies, usually with a free goodie included. They are the best company I've dealt with in this regard, bar none.

A final note: these ratings are comparable to the material in the sets. Excellent doesn't mean it's Criterion quality. It means that it's comparable to a regular DVD. Good means it's comparable to VHS quality. If you own one of these sets, you'll already know this. I've read about people complaining about pixelation or blocky darks on their 70"" 1080i widescreen TV's. This is going to happen with two or three movies on each side of a disc (or four movies on one side of a dual layer disc). So, I thought I'd mention this before continuing.

Now, on to the movies in this Sci-Fi Invasion 50 Movie Pack.

And there you have it. Fifty movies for fifteen bucks or less. If you read all the synopsis, you'll see that fifty sci-fi movies is stretching it quite a bit, but that's forgivable. Another thing you'll notice is that quality is all over the place. This is another item that I'll forgive. You've got some pretty rare gems in this set, and to have them at all is pretty good. Some of these movies are surprising in their quality when the age of them is factored in. And other times it's puzzling when a newer movie is in widescreen, but the audio is not up to snuff. As I said at the beginning of my review, I look at these sets as primers for the genre they represent, and if a movie seems really great to you, go out and grab a remastered version of it. And the other reason for grabbing these is because some of these have never been, and probably will never be released on DVD except on these sets. I hope you enjoyed the review of this set, and find it informative. Hopefully this will be popular enough to have more of these sets reviewed for you. I'm giving this set an 8/10.",1366934400,16,29212,5.337100630297761
4509169,4,B004ZJ9VXY,"Despite the fact that most of these movies are low-budget films from Italy, Japan and even here in America dating all the way back to the 30s up to the mid-90s or so, There's fun to be had in this collection of 50 films. Filmmakers such as Roger Corman, Don Dohler, William Sachs are featured here as well as others. Hollywood stars include Vincent Price, Dorothy Stratten, Mark Hamill, Bill Paxton, Klaus Kinski, Harvey Keitel, Franco Nero & George Kennedy among others!

My favorites are: The Bat, Slipstream, The Day Time Ended, Galaxina, Invaders from Space, Top Line, Battle Beyond the Sun, Star Knight and Abraxas - Guardian of the Universe!!

In my honest opinion, some of these movies are way better than many of the sci-fi movies we see today. They should've been classics but, instead, are left to be included in collections like these today.

Some wonderful finds with some ""so bad it's good"" and a few real bad movies. Seems every 3 or 4 movie disc has a flick that would make the purchase price worthwhile.

The sound tracks are unimpressive as well.

Also at least three of the CD's have flaws that cause the movies to skip and loose track or not play at all.  You will have to fiddle with it.  If you have more than one DVD player you will have to keep trying until a DVD works.",1360368000,,611,4.11864406779661

But what else do you expect? a star war collection?  Well, that will be double the price sir,... any way I also brought also ""Sci-fi Classics "" and say this probably the better of the two sets.

4509184,3,B004ZJ9VXY,I bought it as a gift to my step son for fun to give him more then videos games but to watch other things like old movies and shows. He watch 2 of them and likes them. I watched one of them and was shocked. It is far quality and interesting . For the price a long entertament its worth it.,1356566400,,289,3.7540983606557377
4509185,5,B004ZJ9VXY,These remind me of all the saturdays I spent watching MST3K on tv as a regular ritual. The price can not be beat either.,1356220800,,120,4.041666666666667
4509186,3,B004ZJ9VXY,"The good: 50 b-movies, dirt cheap and spread across 12 dual-layer DVDs!  I snagged my copy for all of $10, and a going rate of 20 cents per film is insane, even for schlock like this.  And where else are you likely to find a DVD release of something like R.O.T.O.R.?

The bad:  The manufacturing quality of the discs themselves seems pretty low.  I've only looked at four of the discs and already noticed a couple of defects in the disc media itself.  Playback's been OK so far, but I'm taking the liberty of making digital backups in case the discs go bad in the future.

The ugly: The mastering quality of these is all over the board, but generally ranges from mediocre to horrifying.  Some appear to have been pulled from VHS, with intermittent tracking artifacts.  In particular, Hundra is almost unwatchable, with a mix of VHS chroma artifacting, MPEG macroblocking, and rampant posterization in evidence.  Other than dodgy source material most of these issues can be traced back to the squeezing of four or five movies onto a single disc.  For technical wonks out there, the average video bitrate seems to hover between 2.5 and 3 Mbit/second for most of these.  MPEG-2 just doesn't deliver great results at that kind of bitrate - it's about on par with Netflix's lower levels of streaming quality.  Audio is Dolby Digital stereo across the board, and other than the intermittent quirk of the source material the films in this collection show faithful but unremarkable audio presentations.

Overall: Kind of a treasure trove at the price point, but keep your expectations reasonable.

Edit: Having made backups of all the videos, I can confirm that I DO have the copy of Raiders of Atlantis in anamorphic widescreen.  *HOWEVER,* it looks like that particular film is a 4:3 pan 'n' scan stretched to 1.85:1.  I'm not sure whether that applies to any of the other films in the collection, but be aware.  There was a defect in the disc containing Horror High that prevented me from viewing more than the first minute and a half of that film.  After e-mailing Mill Creek Entertainment, they sent a replacement DVD *two days later,* and included a copy of their Aliens, Abductions and Extraordinary Sightings DVD set as well.  That's terrific customer service.",1351468800,7,2260,4.805699481865285

This set features classics, aliens, and a few horror movies, such as the cult classic Horror High about a teenage version of Dr. Jeckel & Mr. Hyde. The movie was released in 1974 to mainly drive-ins; despite being PG the movie is actually bloody. In The Day Time Ended (which is produced by Charles Band), A normal family is visited by alien beings, and these beings transports the family's home to prehistoric times. My favorite is Future Hunters starring Robert Patrick (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Linda Carol, who play a young couple who are given the Spear of Destiny by a man from the year 2025. The spear happens to the exact one that was used on Christ at the Crucifixion. If it falls into the wrong hands the world is doomed.

4509193,1,B004ZJ9VXY,I received this item and out of the first two disk I could only watch half of the movies. There is some kind of problem with it and two movies on each were not able to be watched. I haven't tried the other disk yet but so far the quality isn't any good.,1341187200,7,253,3.792452830188679
4509194,4,B004ZJ9VXY,"Having purchased this set a month ago, I am still watching these films. A few I have seen before and were glad to add to my collection,some I didn't realize I'd seen before until I watched them, and some were surprises. None of the films I've watched so far are horrible. A few are campy,but that is the fun part of watching them. You can't go in expecting Spielberg because you will be disappointed. Over all,you get films that have been lost in time from the early 70s on into the 80s, and that is fun for me. Anyone who really is a sci-fi fan can see the creativity and imagination that went into these. Besides where else would you get this many hours of fun for this price?!

4509195,3,B004ZJ9VXY,"SciFi Invasion????  Nope.  For example, out of four videos on first disk, only one was nearly ""invasion"", and it was really bad.  I like campy movies, but this was a bit much.  The other three were just not ""invasion"" at all, just really bad scifi...really bad.  I will not purchase a ""bargain"" product like this again.",1336694400,,319,4.625

4509197,5,B004ZJ9VXY,"If you love these types of flicks, then this set is for you! I made this purchase solely for Raiders Of Atlantis, which was previously on VHS. So far I have also enjoyed Horror High, Evil Brain From Outer Space aka Starman, The Brother From Another Planet and The Bat. The real surprise cheese award goes to Robo Vampire, which has one of the funniest intros I have seen in along time. I laughed out loud! So sit back, make some popcorn and enjoy the ride!",1332806400,5,456,4.313953488372093
4509198,5,B004ZJ9VXY,"Before reading this, realize, that you are not going to find any A movies in any Mill Creek set. If however, you like B quality movies, these sets are wonderful. I have my own rating system for these and all movies.
Ralph's Rating System
A ---> Great acting and/or known actors, great script, great special effects. (Same as most of the world)
B ---> Good acting and/or known actors, good script, decent special effects. Watchable
C ---> Decent acting and unknown actors, fair script, cheesy special effects. Somewhat watchable.
D ---> Poor Acting, Unknown actors, poor script, cheap/bad special effects. Barely watchable.
E ---> Terrible Acting, Unknown actors, terrible script, no special effects, or terrible special effects. Unwatchable.

Now, with that in mind. You must understand, Mill Creek only has movies that fall between the B and E rating above. Also, you must understand that I love Mill Creek sets. But, there is a certain reality one must face when purchasing these sets. First B - E movies, and repeats from other sets. one movie, The Bat, I have in more sets from Mill Creek then I can count.

That having been said, I have seen disc 5, as I purchased this set due to the sale price and ""Blood City"" which I had previously owned on video tape(still do) and wanted on DVD. On disc 5, there are 2 B movies, 1, D movie, and 1 E movie. ""Blood City"" and ""Future Hunters"" are B Movies, ""It's Alive"" a D movie,and ""Creeping Terror"" an E movie ruined by way too much narration and very poor acting.""  ""Future Hunters"" would have been better had it stuck to one type of story, but this movie is not sure what type of movie it wants to be, as it jumps from apocalyptic to martial arts to well you can see for your selves.

Additional comments: So far I've only sampled the 8 first films in this list, as I like to start from ""worst"" to ""best"". The only true snoozers so far have been ""Extraterrestrial Visitors"" and ""Night Fright"" (which in my opinion deserves only 1 star). The rest were either interesting as a snapshot in time, or as cheesy fun(particularly ""The Creeping Terror"" and ""Abraxas""). If my experience with other sets is any indicator, I will eventually find some films which are also entertaining in a more serious fashion.

I also like the fact that a good number of the movies in the set date from the 70's onward.",1331424000,154,4671,3.9547960308710035
4509200,5,B004ZJ9VXY,"The Sci Fi Invasion box set includes many public domain sci-fi movies which are hard to find and even a few that I had never heard of, which is surprising since I am a huge sci-fi buff. Some of them are campy old stinkers, but half of the fun of watching old sci-fi movies is groaning at the bad acting and even worst special effects.  This set is great fun at a very reasonable price.",1329436800,6,385,4.133333333333334
4509201,3,B004ZJ9VXY,"I'm hooked on Mill Creek's great 50 packs. As others have pointed out, this set has some duplication with previous Mill Creek sets. Let me add two more cautions:

* These are 12 single-sided discs, not double-sided. Easier to handle, but probably more compressed.

* This set contains mostly public domain movies, but at least six are copyrighted by Crown International Pictures. Looks like Brain Twisters (1991), The Crater Lake Monster (1977), The Creeping Terror (1964), Death Machines (1976), Galaxina (1980), and Horror High (1974) are Crown products. There may be more. If you like to use movie clips for mashups or other fun stuff, hands off of these.

Mind you, I'm happy to get copies of Galaxina and The Creeping Terror to watch. I just wish Mill Creek had more prominently labeled which movies are copyrighted and which ones are up for grabs.",1328572800,4,853,4.909722222222222

The disks had 2 sides and they were labeled very tiny. The disk were super cheap. The movies were mostly good but super primitive transfers.
With this release wow i was blown  away. 1. There are 4 movies one one disk and they are professional labeled. The menus are more user friendly and above all the movies are of better quality. They are harder to find gems. Like 40% of these were on mstk300.
One of the first movies i put on was about a robot assassin from the 1980's and i laughed so hard i had to turn it off. It contains a robot that ""has to fully charge uninterrupted for 30 min"". I laughed prob harder than i have in years it was so corny.
I watched a few and i think this may be like 90% classic watchable bad films. I feel this one it totally worth buying. It is a must have for people who love retro movies.",1521676800,3,989,4.097938144329897
