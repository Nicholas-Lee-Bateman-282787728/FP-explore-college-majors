5825273,4,B00DL47XES,"""Baggage Claim"" (2013 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Montana or 'Mo' (played by Paula Patton, a/k/a Mrs. Robin Thicke), a 29 yr. old single woman who has not found success or happiness in love. As the movie opens, we get to know Mo's mom, who (in a clever montage) we see getting married, and remarried and again and again (as Mo keeps grows up and becomes a woman). Then there is Mo's younger sister, a college student, who has just announced she's gotten engaged to be married in exactly 30 days. Mo is a flight attendant, and her coworkers decide to help and find ""the right guy"" for her by looking up the travel bookings made by Mo's former flames and 'accidentally' having Mo work on those flights. Before we know it, we see Mo flying around the country and creating chance-encounters with these ex-flames. Will Mo find the right guy in time for her sister's wedding in 30 days? To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is the Paula Patton show from start to finish. She is in just about every single scene of the movie, and she radiates the screen with her charm and energy. If it wasn't for her, I doubt I'd even have bothered with this movie. We saw her just a few months ago in ""2 Guns"", and it seems she is ascending the ranks of leading Hollywood women rather quickly. Good for her. Second, the photography of this movie is a real eye-pleaser. Tons of gorgeous city skyline shots from the air throughout the movie (the movie is a true travel movie by air). Third, this movie does not break any new ground in, or stands apart from, many other recent rom-coms, and in that sense it is quite unremarkable, yet it is predictable as it is enjoyable. Fourth, there are a couple of truly hilarious scenes, the best one for me when Mo is on a date with an ex-flame who is a politician. They are joined by a wealthy older couple (featuring Ned Beatty). At one point the conversation turns what makes Tiger Woods ""black"", and whether he is ""black"" enough. Just watch!

Speaking of which: As I went to see this in the theatre here in Cincinnati a few days ago, I had no idea that I, a middle aged white man, am not at all the target audience for this movie (it became clear quickly that the is a movie mostly featuring African-Americans and intended mostly for the African-American community). To be honest, it never bothered me in the least, and I enjoyed this movie for what it is: a rom-com that is as predictable as it is enjoyable, mainly due to Paula Patton. ""Baggage Claim"" is worth checking out, whether in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1380672000,30,2667,4.440816326530612

5825312,5,B00DL47XES,"Five HUMOROUS Stars. In this enjoyable 'airline-centric' romantic comedy, ""Baggage Claim"", matriarch Catherine Moore is preparing to marry off her youngest daughter in a month. But she has fading marriage hopes for her single, older, pretty, ""9-times a bridesmaid"" airline hostess daughter, Montana. To appease her mother, Montana goes on a funny 30-day search for 'Mr Right' based on one very unique parameter. This leads to some hilarious moments as her two best friends and a platoon of airport workers join in the conspiracy. Starring an excellent cast of Paula Patton, Jenifer Lewis, Derek Luke, Taye Diggs, Jill Scott (yes, her), Boris Kodjoe, Tremaine Neverson, Adam Brody, Lauren London, Tia Mowry, La La Anthony, with Ned Beatty and Djimon Hounsou. Music by Aaron Zigman. Co-produced by Steven J. Wolfe with writer/director David E. Talbert. Very enjoyable and Highly Recommended. Five DETERMINED Stars. (Fox Searchlight Pictures.

5825444,3,B00DL47XES,"Baggage Claim isn't the most emotionally complex of rom coms, nor is it exactly the most plausible, but it is of the fun if you don't overthink it sort.  The cast is superb, particularly Paula Patton and Derek Luke.  While the story doesn't feel entirely original at times and the humor trends toward silly more often than not, the message of basically being happy with oneself is uplifting and somewhat inspirational.  Even with the expected (not to mention more or less telegraphed ending) the film is a fun way to pass 90 odd minutes.  It's nice to see a film like this now and again - something that's got a touch of complexity but a shorter run time but never completely takes itself seriously.",1442102400,,699,4.612903225806452
5825445,5,B00DL47XES,This movie was both funny and entertaining. I gave it a five star rating. Paul Patton was verrrry Funny. I enjoyed all of the characters in this movie !,1442016000,,152,4.275862068965517

5825449,2,B00DL47XES,I could honestly turn away and come back to this movie not feeling like I missed anything. It was so predictable and the dialog was boring. A little over-acted by Paula Patton. Too much whinning. Jill Scott's talent was wasted. Derek Luke was the only saving grace.,1439596800,,265,4.659574468085107
5825450,2,B00DL47XES,Trailer shows every funny part. Too predictable and poor acting,1439510400,,63,5.4
5825451,3,B00DL47XES,I love Paula Patton. This is a mildly amusing film about a woman who is having difficulty finding the right man. This is a problem that many woman have. Patton's character is intelligent but often finds herself in ridiculous situations. She decides to talk to her old boyfriends and see if there is any chemistry left and finds them to be less than appealing. The all star cast gives a good performance. I wish the script was a bit sharper. Recommended for fans of funny romantic comedies.,1438905600,,489,4.632183908045977
5825452,5,B00DL47XES,"As other reviews have noted, anyone who has ever seen a rom-com at least once in their life can figure out who the knight in shining armor will be in the end, probably in five minutes or less. However, this film is well acted and offers a lot of good laughs! I personally do not buy or consider buying movies too often, my DVD and streaming collection combined is probably less than 20. This was a delight, ""Baggage Claim"" is a light, feel-good flick that made me laugh out loud several times, and has a good message albeit a predictable ending; I enjoyed it so much I would definitely consider purchasing it, or at least adding it to my wishlist for later gifting.

The movie is based around Montana (Paula Patton) who is a flight attendant, she feels she is not a woman nor a lady unless she marries ASAP because she is already 30. Both Montana and younger sister Sheree (Lauren London) were taught by their mother Catherine (Jenifer Lewis - I've yet to a movie of hers I didn't like) the importance of getting married and starting a family by the age of 30, even though she herself has been married/divorced five times. Montana is on a mission to find Mr. Right within 30 days and with the help of fellow flight attendants and best friends Gail (Jill Scott) and Sam (Adam Brody) put together a plot to find ex-boyfriends as they travel during the holiday season. The flight attendants enlist airport personnel to assist in finding the ex's and making sure Montana is on their plane; the airport crew are hilarious and it's worth renting/buying the flick for them alone. The airport crew consists of curb-side luggage clerk Calvin (Ricky Smiley), check-in agent Tanya (La La Anthony), TSA Cedric (Affion Crockett), and one more who I cannot recall. For those that remember ""Sister, Sister"" or watch the reality show, Tia Mowry has a cameo as a ""crazy"" girlfriend, another funny part in the movie. The smaller role of Langston (Taye Diggs), a ""Black Libertarian"" who wishes Montana was obedient like his beloved dog Juicy, offers even more laughs throughout the film.",1438732800,2,2068,4.681318681318682

5825497,5,B00DL47XES,"Well there is always a first and this show has it all, Actors and storyline are fantastic with just a bit of this and that will throw all things together. A story of a airhost stewardess running and catching planes all over the world trying to find Mister Right, When she meets this senator running for congress,  who buys everything he wants and rules with a iron hand just ask the dog, he'll back me up on this, when told to go to toilet he goes no questions asked or barking anyway!  Yes the comedy is in there where two friends lend a hand in different schemes. Very touching to a point I would have to say I liked it and would recommend to all. I rated this an A grade plus for being different in some ways and holding my attention throughout the entire show.

5825515,1,B00DL47XES,"This movie had disaster written all over it. The opening montage set it off on the wrong foot and never recovered after that. I love Paula Patton, but she tries too hard to be funny. She's a great actress as evidenced in Precious, and two of her other comedy movies were much better than this. Those movies being Swing Vote and Jumping The Broom, but she was mere eye candy in those. This movie suggests that candy and comedy don't mix. I'm also a fan of Lauren London and I was disheartened that the movie that she and Paula Patton were in together ended up being this dud. Hopefully they can do another movie together. They went all out assembling a cast of Patton, London, Jeniffer Lewis, Lala Vasquez, Jill Scott, Christina Milian, Tia Mowry, Derek Luke, Adam Brody, Boris Kodjoe, Trey Songz, Taye Diggs, and Djimon Hounsou. A lot of big names and nothing to show for it. The writing in this movie is horrible, the lines seemed forced, and the production value looks that of a soap opera or an ABC reality TV dating show. This movie is garbage, hence its name Garbage Claim. Arguably one of the 10 or 20 worst movies ever. This a flight that you'll glad that you missed!",1424131200,,1174,4.465116279069767

So, her friends convince her to reconnect with any of her ""former flames"" via their flight schedule. The storyline as well as many scenes seemed unrealistic, immature, inadequate and uninteresting.  I was very disappointed....

5825720,4,B00DL47XES,"I haven't had the chance to actually watch this movie based on what the critics were saying about it. I wanted to see it from the start because it seemed like it had an all-star cast who would play their parts very well. But with all of the disagreement, I think this was a pretty good movie. The one thing that I felt was cliche was the plot was quite predictable. With already knowing who the main character would end up with, it was interesting for Paula Patton's part to be involved with many of these male characters and see their different personalities.

- The message of this movie is really empowering, showing that getting married is not as important as staying married, and the materialistic things do not matter. It really shows a message dedicated to single people and married couples.

- I would praise the supporting characters the most, but specifically Jill Scott, Adam Brody, and Tia Mowry. Scott and Brody are definitely a funny pair together and they gave out most of the humor in the movie. Tia Mowry's minor part was a highlight as well. The humor wasn't as big with everyone, but it was definitely good.

I think this movie is quite overlooked and I think that it is worth a buy and worth a watch. Yes the plot is predictable, but it's definitely worth viewing if you are interested in movies that enter meaningful topics that all individuals can relate to. I think the movie is good!",1407974400,,1407,4.553359683794467

A lot of bad acting, actually, except for the actors who play Montana's bestie-since-childhood--William Wright--and Montana's funny mom (she's not in there enough!). I could have written the storyline---or you could have---ANYBODY could have--with half a brain and half a heart tied behind our back. No, wait--we would have written something way more interesting and genuine--or REAL! But if you are looking for some eye candy--please proceed forward and rent the HD version--you wanna make sure you can see every sweet detail of  perfection.  Mostly clean--no explicit sex scenes so that's a plus in my book. And honestly, I laughed MORE at the ridiculously bad writing than I did the actual ""comedic"" portions. Why did I watch the entire movie? Because I had to justify the money I spent to rent it. I wish you well on your search for great movies!",1401494400,3,1020,4.988235294117647

5825881,1,B00DL47XES,Who decided to give Paula Patton the lead acting role in this? She is a terrible actress! Her supporting cast were a thousand times better. Her constant whining and over acted facial expressions were so painful to watch. I wanted to stop watching but since I paid $5 I had to power through. Cute movie idea just terrible leading actress.,1400544000,2,337,4.633333333333334

5825885,3,B00DL47XES,This movie was funny but it is the same old story a man and woman best friends in other relationships and at the end find they are in love with each other. It is entertaining how she flys all over to try to meet up with guys she already dated before and figure out why it didn't work previously. Wait for it to get to TV,1399852800,,320,3.8636363636363638

5825919,4,B00DL47XES,"Movie was okay -- not sure that it should have rented out at $5.99 though -- more of a $2.99 price.  It had a message -- more so for young women about not needing to be married to be whole or be in a relationship to count yourself worthy.  And her ""perfect"" guy of course was the man right next door.  Wasnt that hard to figure out after 15 minutes of the movie.",1399334400,,362,3.9315068493150687

5825999,5,B00DL47XES,This movie was sort of a breath of fresh air as far as movies go today. It was lightly comical and romantic and not too serious and heavy with sexual innuendo. I don't have a long review I just really enjoyed this movie.,1397088000,,220,4.1395348837209305

5826001,5,B00DL47XES,"I loved this movie -- so much so that I'm buying it!  It's funny and a great pick-me-up --- even if it is corny and predictable.  Paula Patton is indeed a charmer and very sweet.  She could actually brand herself as the black Doris Day in this type of genre, though she is capable of doing serious roles as well.  It was great seeing an attractive, black cast in a feel-good movie, especially since many of the black films in the last year have centered on very heavy subjects.  I also didn't realize the comedic talent of Jill Scott, who played the best friend to Paula's character.  She was so cute and hilarious, and I loved the energy between she and actor who played their male friend and fellow flight attendant.

Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm from Baltimore, and that is where this movie is supposed to take place, but I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.  It certainly holds its own against - say any of J-Lo's romantic vehicles!",1397088000,,971,4.508571428571429

That part made no sense, maybe she just wanted someone new, maybe deep down she was too scared to change the friendship into something more for fear of losing a great friend.

Cons:  The entire cast except for Patton was overacted.  Luke-warm storyline which dragged and dragged...to the point I found myself asking at different points throughout the movie if it was going to be over SOON.

Conclusion:  I'll be glad to watch Patton in a different feature but the bottom line remains that this film is a rip-off. Amazon should lower its price. Not worth the time or money.",1394928000,,461,4.784810126582278

5826290,5,B00DL47XES,"This is an incredibly well written movie script.  It is the BEST movie of 2013.  The plot is well written.  It is funny at times.  It's about trying to hard to find Mr. Right and realizing that Mr. Right is your best friend of many years.  Paula Patton in her best feature starring lead role yet as the love seeking character Montana -- except that the character is not trying to find Mr. Right because she wants to, but because of the societal pressures put upon women to be married by a certain age.  For the character Montana, all the pressures to be married are coming from her mother and family and friends.  This really is an enjoyable family movie with a good soundtrack and some good comedy relief throughout the movie.  Good non-stop action throughout the entire film so it never gets boring.  Literally, the BEST movie to come out in 2013.  It should have gotten more recognition at the box office.  Saw it in the movie theatre and decided this is a bought DVD as soon as it comes out.  Paula Patton as the lead actress does an incredible job throughout the whole movie.",1394496000,,1080,4.454081632653061

5826513,1,B00DL47XES,Omg! I couldn't get pass 30 minutes! This movie is awful. Paula Patton's scratchy voice is annoying and not sexy at all. She is a terrible actress and seems to be high throughout the 30 minutes I watched. Can Amazon refund the 4.99 I paid to rent this movie????,1393545600,4,261,4.346938775510204

My doughter was washing the movie with me and I thought that was a great lessons for her to see the different ways a man can manipulate a women. I cried and laughed and I think its a great movie. I added baggage claim to my collection of movies. I recommend this movie so strongly to everyone especially to the young girls who are starting to date. I wish this movie was out when I was looking for the right man in my life. I was lied to from a man who was merried and already was a dad of two children. I was in the altar with this man saying my bowels while his first wife was in the delivery room giving birth to my soon to be husband second son.

5826555,1,B00DL47XES,Just didn't care for it. Seemed more funny and worth watching in the previews rather than the actually full movie,1392940800,,113,4.7

5826557,4,B00DL47XES,It was a cute movie for a Friday evening with nothing to do. Typical romantic comedy. Check it out definitely.,1392940800,,110,4.55
5826613,2,B00DL47XES,It is not a ROM Com like advertised. Paula's voice is awful. Her character is so desperate. No character development. The only likeable characters are the neighbor and the male flight attendant. All the characters fit a very specific stereotype.,1392940800,,245,5.15
5826614,4,B00DL47XES,"I thought it was cute.  A couple of scenes I thought unnecessary and Ii went ""oh, please"", but overall a fun and entertaining movie to watch.  I purchased and I'll probably watch again and again with my girls.",1392854400,,209,4.473684210526316
5826615,5,B00DL47XES,I enjoyed this dvd. The mother unknowing put a big pain in both of her daughters life about marriage. If it's meant to happen just let it. Her best friend was the love of her life. I hear best friends make the best marriages.,1392854400,,225,4.136363636363637

5826619,3,B00DL47XES,"Glad I didn't spend the money to watch in a movie theater. Paula Patton over acts, but I enjoyed Derek Luke's part. Funny to see Jill Scott as a loosey goosey. Worth the $4.99 to sit in the comfort of your own home.",1392768000,,215,4.023255813953488

5826656,1,B00DL47XES,"The worst! The movie is a cavalcade of stereotypes and nonsense. I rented it for bad movie night and in that regard it did not disappoint. I know that Paula Patton is a decent actress, but there is zero evidence of that in this movie.",1392595200,,234,4.222222222222222

5826662,3,B00DL47XES,"If you are looking for mindless comedy (with a few funny moments) and a predictable story line this is it.  Paula patton has the unique ability (among African American actresses) to take on this convincing plaintiff, girly, whiny, needy persona that is both appealing at its best and tiresome at its worst.  I know her hubby R. Thicke enjoys playing doctor/nurse with her (I would!).  Thicke is also a secure man - b/c when Patton kisses on screen, she kisses . . . with as much if not more passion than any of my love interests have.  I must say though that when Jill Scott enters with even a modestly low cut blouse, Patton and everything else said during the scene D  I  S  A  P  P  E  A  R  S!  She is indeed an all star!!!!  I'm sure feminists hate the enjoyment men get from seeing those . . !",1392508800,,799,4.198675496688741

5826684,4,B00DL47XES,This movie was pretty good.  I had a few laughs watching it.  And it kept my attention throughout.  That's all I ask for these days.  Some movies are made so badly that it's not worth the money to get into the theatre.  I ordered this on dvd instead of going to the theatre and was glad I did...now I can loan it to my girlfriends to watch too.  More on the chick flicky side.,1392422400,,376,4.013513513513513

The idea of a woman feeling she needs a man in her life is so common, and something most women feel at some point. That is what women will connect to at first. The the independent thing kicks in.
This film shows the power of love, but even more so about the power of loving yourself first.
Paula Patton did a great job and fit this part perfect. Being a fan of Real Husbands of Hollywood, I admit, I wasn't crazy about her kissing Boris. My mouth hit the floor!
Still, it was a great movie that most women will like. Men, probably not as much. This is definitely what I call a chick-flick.",1391904000,,718,4.063380281690141

Paula Patten gets on my nerves with her facial expressions. However, with her simple acting it seemed to fit in well with the simple movie. It is something to watch if you are bored, but do't expect much. It is not even good for a lot for laughs.",1391817600,2,396,4.089743589743589

Look, all the negative reviews are unnecessary in my opinion. Its ok to be a little critic because I don't waste time on reviewing bad or awful movies. But this one is good and indeed funny.

The reference of this movie being the African American remake of 27 dress is absurd. There is a big jump between being bridesmaid 9x (4x with same person, so it doesn't really count or matter) versus 27x. The story line is different.

5826833,5,B00DL47XES,I saw this movie in the theatre and laughed almost the whole time.  This movie is very funny (although it is very unrealistic).  Loved all of the actors and actresses.  Good purchase for anyone who needs a good laugh.,1391644800,,217,4.512820512820513
5826834,4,B00DL47XES,"I thought the movie was going to be just OK, but I'm glad I watched it was actually pretty good. The funniest part was with Tia acting crazy banging on the door and Trey Songz who by the way that is his best performance ever acting. Overall great movie funny, cute, definitely worth watching again.",1391558400,,298,4.4363636363636365
5826835,3,B00DL47XES,"This was pretty entertaining but it wasn't great.  It reminded me of the ever popular ""27 Dresses"" with Katherine H., which in my opinion was just ok enough that it didn't warrant a AA remake. Montana's character is very typical of the Paula Patton -typecasting roles she takes often, slightly ditsy with a touch of comedy and attitude.  It wasn't a bad movie at all. Also the casting of every shade AA male - and good looking males at that - made this movie a little more entertaining.",1391558400,,486,4.511363636363637
5826836,2,B00DL47XES,I like it .i think the movie have a moral when u looking for something si far away sometimes what u looking for is right under ur nose.,1391558400,2,135,3.857142857142857
5826837,5,B00DL47XES,"I loved this film, I laughed so hard it made my stomach hurt a few times. Very positive spiritual message about marriage; and Paula Patton is great!",1391385600,,148,4.518518518518518
5826838,2,B00DL47XES,"This movie is way too predictable. It was not very funny and there was a lot of bad acting. This movie is about a chick that is trying to find get engage in 30 days. Her little sister is getting married in 30 days. Of course you guessed it, she is a 30 year old who never been married or have kids and feeling she has no self worth since everyone else have husbands and she 30 with no husband. She has all her friends stalk her ex- boyfriends to see if there any potential husbands. Funny because if they are your ex its because it did not work out. She has a next door neighbor who know her very well but she don't look at him as the husband type until she discover all of ex are taken or moved on. Hell of cliche. I don't think this was Paula Patton's best acting, because her voice was annoying. And facial expressions seemed focused, annoying and unnatural. Frankly, she came off as desperate.",1390867200,13,897,4.190751445086705
5826839,5,B00DL47XES,I give this movie 5 stars it is very well written. The eye candy (the guys) especially Derek Luke one who I enjoy watching.,1390867200,,123,4.166666666666667
5826840,2,B00DL47XES,"Besides the fact that everyone knows how that movies was going to end, Paula Patton sucks as an actress. She was very annoying in the movie; from her voice to her acting. Thought they tried to bring some hot dudes in the movie, it still didn't matter. Had it not been for Jill Scott's charm and Adam Brody, this movie would have been a complete flop.",1390608000,2,350,4.318181818181818
5826841,4,B00DL47XES,"Like so many movies, you can guess within five minutes what is going to ultimately happen with the Paula Patton character. However, it still was a fun and funny journey to watch her get there. Both Diggs and Scott were funny. The other characters were played it straight but Scott and Diggs play it funny and it brightened up the movie. Patton was wonderful with material she was given and by the end, I could see how some older sisters girls would feel that pressure to find a man, especially when relatives keep going when are you going to find someone and settle down? Then you have to show up at your baby sister's wedding with no man again? Not thinking straight you just might look up those old dates to see if things could be different this time and of course, once you do, you remember why they didn't work in the first place. This movie is like that. When it's out to rent or buy, curl up on the couch and enjoy the performances and the likable but predictable journey to end.",1388793600,13,985,4.358695652173913
5826842,2,B00DL47XES,"""It's not a man I need, it's a husband, a potential husband in a month."" Montana (Patton) is going to be a bridesmaid at her sisters wedding. She is excited for her but also depressed because her younger sister is getting married before her. When she tells her friends they come up with a plan. She will meet all of her ex's one more time and try to find a husband before the wedding date which is 30 days away. I have to admit right off that this is not usually my type of movie. I'm not huge into romantic comedies so I wasn't all that excited about watching this. While I will admit I have seen worse my biggest complaint with movies is some are way too predictable and when you know the outcome 5 minutes in the movie becomes a little boring and loses magic. This is one of those movies. It wasn't even like it was a surprise twist either, when the star says I'm never gonna find a husband and instantly someone she has known forever walks into the screen...DING DING DING! An hour and a half later...told you. I know movies like this aren't supposed to have a lot of twists but this was so predictable that it made every other scene meaningless there was no ""will she pick him"" feeling. That made the movie boring to me. Overall, way too predictable to be enjoyable. I give it a C.",1388707200,4,1286,4.253061224489796

8594178,3,B00DL47XES,"This is a good movie to play for background noise.  There are some good points about not settling or doing things for the wrong reasons, so that's a one star.  And there are moments that are funny, so that's another star.  There are handsome black men, and that's always a star in my book.  However, Paula Patton's facial expressions are very off-putting and Jill Scott's character is cringeworthy, so they blocked off any chance of other stars.  I'm wondering if this was worth the money I paid.",1529971200,,496,4.655172413793103
