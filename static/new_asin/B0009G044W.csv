You should know these videos do not go over the stretching exercises you need but they offer exact techniques that you would learn paying hundreds or thousands of dollars to a school. Thanks for making these DVD's, I am going to buy the rest of the series :)",1426723200,,396,4.1558441558441555

8060085,4,B0009G044W,"I think it's so stupid how people say you can't self teach your self the martial arts. The ancient masters of old learned from parchments, so why can't I use a dvd or a book. I don't care if I live up to the standereds of the school. I am commited to self teach my self kung fu and this is a very good tool to go about that, my only complaint is that the teacher in this video doesn't cover the slow enough, he goes with the assumption that people already know kung fu. However, it's got a lot of really good infomation in it.",1306195200,4,526,3.9716981132075473
8060086,5,B0009G044W,"I am short on time and funds for martial arts classes. So, I got Wing Chun Lesson 1, 2 and 3 by Sifu Chow. I have used videos on Jiu Jitsu, Chin Na and Kali. I have had live instruction in boxing and Tae Kwon Do so I can compare these Wing Chun videos to other martial arts instructions. I rate these as quality videos Wing Chun because the instructor is clear and thorough and covers the movements in enough detail so you can see what is happening in the forms and understand why. I'd recommend these.",1294358400,4,502,4.185567010309279
