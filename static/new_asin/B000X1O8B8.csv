Obscurity may be the case for the difficulty level in finding certain movies, as in, they're actually decent movies but because the majority of people like movies with BIG STARS and LOTSA ACTION (or ROMANCE) they've been sadly overlooked and are actually gems that are highly sought after. In some cases movies have been overlooked and when they surface, they should be treated like nuclear waste and buried in a dump somewhere, like this little ""gem"". Bad doesn't quite go far enough in describing this. It's mostly a soft-core movie with horror overtones, with much of the former and little of the latter. It does boast one decent scene with this wild-haired chick being chased through a tunnel with groovy 60's druggie music for a background. In my time I've only seen about one and a half porno movies (one at a bachelor party) and this fits the guidelines just fine, minimal story line, maximum sack-time, makes no sense. The chick with the wild hair (called Catwoman in the closing credits) is interesting, her hair is like a nightmare, the scariest thing in the movie, for sure.  And I actually LIKE bad movies, but this one, oh....just say no.",1240876800,,1374,4.7447698744769875
