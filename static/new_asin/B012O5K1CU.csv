7357241,5,B012O5K1CU,This is a movie with a great premise (Lucifer is out because of term limits!! The new Devil moves hell to NJ!!) and terrific acting! Not to give to much away but there is just so many funny parts - Eve has left Adam and is now (unhappily) married to Lucifer. Each Devil's assistant is called his Devil's Advocate! And Lucifer's Devil's Advocate is Judas. A running gag where a  beautiful waitress is mistaken for a stripper/hooker throughout the film. Lucifer trying to use EZ Pass on the NJ Turnpike. There was a lot of funny scenarios set up and the movie delivers on most of them. A really fun watch!,1447286400,2,603,4.4324324324324325
7357242,5,B012O5K1CU,"Star - Penelope Lagos has done it again! This movie keeps you moving with beauty, horror, suspense and comedy. The references to lyrics in legendary rock and roll songs, the stage being set for a ""New"" leader downstairs and the trials and tribulations of a beautiful woman who just wants ""True Love"" surrounded by an entourage of evil doers making room for a changing of The Guard! The cherishing moments of the beauty, the challenge, the acceptance and the forever ego building character of her new mate, truly set The Jersey Devil apart from the rest! Fabulous movie! FIVE STARS FOR SURE !!
Highly recommended, must see - Clark Cotton",1447027200,3,636,4.790909090909091
7357243,4,B012O5K1CU,"This was a truly enjoyable, fun movie. The idea of making New Jersey Hell was very clever and ridiculous at the same time and it lead to really funny situations. I thought the acting was very good and there was enough material to go around to get everyone involved in the craziness. I LOVED the build up to the ending as each new character entered and piled on to the already out of control situation the lead characters had got themselves into.  Watch it, you will see. Well done!!",1446249600,,482,4.415730337078652

8726311,1,B012O5K1CU,"Like an actual temptation:  Looks good at first but then bites like an asp.  They had no idea how to portray the devil (see tv series ""reaper"" ), no menace, no evil, not even a satire on New Jersey.  Like the opening scene (which is funny) , just a long futile wait.",1505692800,,266,4.076923076923077
