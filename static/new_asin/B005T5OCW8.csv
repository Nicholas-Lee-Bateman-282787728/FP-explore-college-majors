8485885,5,B005T5OCW8,"I became a huge MotoGP fan starting in 2009, (haven't missed a race at Laguna Seca since then, although they are cancelling this year's ;(  ), so this DVD really helped me get up to speed on the drama of what happened in the years before 2009.  Particularly interesting to me was the drama between Sete Gibernau and Rossi during the 990cc era....I had heard Sete's name before but was totally unaware of the total animosity that Sete felt for Rossi.  I had known that Nicky Hayden won the championship in 2006, but had felt that it was just a fluke (how could this young upstart beat the King of MotoGP?).  With this DVD, I discovered that Rossi's Yamaha was having major problems during the season and that Pedrosa had taken out teammate Hayden during the next to last race (thereby giving the championship lead to Rossi).  Of course, Rossi's fall would take him out of contention during the last race of the season.

The big complaint I have is that the title says 2002 to 2012 and Simoncelli died in 2011.  It was strange to have the last part of the DVD focus on how dangerous Marco was to the other riders (and how Jorge Lorenzo predicted his behavior would lead to death) and then for the DVD to end without them covering his death (they put one slide of text mentioning it up at the end).  I realize that production ended on the DVD shortly before his death, but they should have made the extra effort to go back to the editing room and create a compelling ending to the DVD that would have tied up the ""loose ends"" on the Simoncelli story.",1389225600,,1547,4.4035087719298245
8485886,5,B005T5OCW8,"im a fan of motorcycle racing and ths shows a bit of history that I missed before I got into it.. if your a moto gp fan, I would definitely recommend it .",1384732800,,154,3.696969696969697
8485887,1,B005T5OCW8,"This is a terrible dvd. Bad editing, lots of subtitles, lots of missing story lines, no seasonal stats or standings. And most of all - its only 9 years worth of bad summation. Simoncelli died in 2011. At the end there's a note about his passing - then the dvd ends.....what kinda crap is that!
This dvd is far less than 'A Decade in MotpGP'. Being a big fan who has lived through this era - I'm embarassed by this dvd; and anyone involved in MotoGP would be too.",1368748800,,462,4.202247191011236
8485888,4,B005T5OCW8,"Well, any video MotoGP produces is worth watching. I already know what there is to know about MotoGP specially the latter years. But still a great video, nonetheless. Worth keeping",1362096000,2,180,5.033333333333333
8485889,2,B005T5OCW8,The editing was very poor. You never knew what year they were talking about. It was disappointing. I was expecting more.,1358553600,,120,4.761904761904762
8485890,3,B005T5OCW8,"Three stars may be a bit harsh, but when the box says ""A Decade in MotoGP"" I expect 10 seasons to be covered.  Sure, we're only halfway through the 2012 season right now, so I shouldn't expect to see much on this season, but this DVD didn't even show all of 2011.  Other than a bit of ""false advertisement"" this really is an enjoyable DVD.",1343260800,3,339,4.2
8485891,4,B005T5OCW8,"This is a very fascinating DVD. It covers 2002-the middle of 2011 with interviews by all the key players. Rossi, Stoner, Lorenzo, etc. It showed different races with current 2011 comments by the people involved. Riders, Team members, and Journalists.
My only complaint is that it stops after the Malaysian GP and Simoncelli death. It doesn't even finish the 2011 season with Casey wining. Besides that, I can highly recommend it!",1326412800,12,429,5.056338028169014
