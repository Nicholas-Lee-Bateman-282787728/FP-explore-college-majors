2158720,5,B0006212JK,"My husband and I just finished watching the final DVD in this series, and it is sad to know there are no more Poirot stories in the near future.  We enjoyed every one, although we differ on favorites.  My husband liked Sad Cypress and The Hollow the best.  My favorite was 5 Little Pigs.

I can't add much to what the other reviewers have said.  The quality of the sets and writing and of course, acting was very very good.  We will no doubt be watching these again soon!",1114214400,5,471,4.235955056179775
2158721,5,B0006212JK,"The new POIROT series produced by A&E is excellent and I  encourage all Poirot and David Suchet fans to purchase the DVD 4-pack.  Suchet has literally grown into the part so he seems more natural than ever as Poirot.  Pals from the earlier episodes, Japp and Hastings, are missing.  I thought their absence and the fact that England has changed so much since the BBC first began airing these `cozy mysteries' might put a damper on my viewing experience but it did not.  The filmography is beautiful. Most of the shots were taken in areas where knowledgeable Anglophiles know the past is fairly well preserved, including some lovely old estates. The BBC does it's best as ususal with lavish sets, costumes, and wonderful old automobiles for each production.

DEATH ON THE NILE - When it comes to this particular story, I still prefer the Peter Ustinov version with Mia Farrow, Betty Davis and Maggie Smith. The original film with Ustinov showed a good deal of actual footage shot in Egypt.  This issue of `Death on the Nile' appears to have some shots in Egypt, but to tell you the truth, they could have shot most of the film elsewhere...for example Central or South America.  Population growth and war have altered the terrain in Egypt considerably since Agatha Christie wrote her novel, which takes place around the 1930s following her travels to the Middle East with her husband, the great archeologist Mallowan.

Poirot - THE HOLLOW - The plot of this episode involves a two-timing husband who may or may not have been done in by his ""stupid"" wife. The wife, a doe-eyed creature who appears unable to harm a fly is soon incarcerated by the police who feel they have `got their man' but Poirot sets about trying to find the truth and unravel the obviously flawed case the police have constructed. Is the murderer the lady of the manor who stupidly placed a revolver in a basket of eggs, or is it the butler who was seen carrying a gun fitting the death weapon's description through the hallway (the lord has a gun collection, so there are plenty of guns about the place). Perhaps the mistress fired the fateful shot? She was two-timed by the dead husband who could not keep his hands off an old flame who suddenly appeared at dinner. Or was it the old flame herself who pulled the trigger?  She was overheard arguing with him and wishing him dead only hours before the crime was committed.

SAD CYPRESS.  Viewers of BRIDESHEAD REVISITED will recognize Diana Quick whose character from that earlier production could be the aged version of her younger self, now lying on her deathbed. Visited by her nearest kin and heirs, she soon succumbs to whatever ails her.  Or does she.  Has she had help?  A cast of suspects soon emerges, but is all this `bother' a tempest in a teapot? Poirot is called in a soon deduces that not only has murder been committed, but the police may have locked up an innocent person.  Soon the pressure is on, and Poirot must act quickly or someone else will die..perhaps at the end of a noose.

THE FIVE LITTLE PIGS is the most sad of all the new series developed by A&E, because a person has been wrongfully executed when the story begins. Perhaps this and other tales based on real life events brought the death penalty to an end in Britain. Gemma Jones stars in this episode involving a young woman named Lucy who seeks to clear her dead mother's name. Lucy's mother was executed some years before for a crime the girl believes she did not commit,  and Lucy writes a letter urging Poirot to help her clear her mother's name.  Poirot agrees to take her case but advises Lucy that she may not like what he uncovers.  As ususal, the cast of characters is composed of excellent actors, many with familiar faces and the plot is excellent.",1113350400,87,3762,4.611694152923538
2158722,5,B0006212JK,"More Poirot and less stupidity is better.  These mysteries show Poirot in solid police procedural form gradually figuring out who did what to whom from a solid group of suspects.  David Suchet, as Poirot, is as good as ever and we get more of him due to the welcome elimination of Captain Hastings and Inspector Japp.  If you want to see Poirot in action with a minimum of silly distractions, then you should be pleased with each mystery in this new collection.  The production values are solid and the transfers appear good as to both picture and sound.",1113177600,,554,4.622448979591836
2158723,2,B0006212JK,"As devout fans of Poirot and David Suchet who are familiar with all 12 sets of the television series and all the movies up to this set, my wife and I are both saddened and disappointed by the sudden drop in quality. One of the presnt episodes, ""The Hollow,"" typifies the shortcomings of this series, which include highly improbable characters, poor scripts, and some overacting. Suchet is wonderful, as always, but seems to have lost some of his edge here. Part of the problem with these newest films may be attributable to the absence of the trio of excellent characters--Hastings, Chief Inspector Japp, and Miss Lemon--whose interactions helped make the earlier efforts so delightful. Regrettably, we cannot recommend this extra series.",1112227200,12,738,5.107438016528926
2158724,5,B0006212JK,"If you love Agatha Christie's Poirot as portrayed so vividly and effectively by David Suchet, then you will want to buy this newest collection.  True, Inspector Japp, Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon are missing, but the substance and themes of these four mysteries more than compensate for their absence.  One of the gratifying aspects of Christie's mysteries for me has always been the importance of character, motivation and ""the psychology"" in all of her stories.  In ""Five Little Pigs,"" ""Sad Cypress,"" ""The Hollow,"" and ""Death on the Nile,"" the emphasis is on character, both in the dramatic and figurative sense. The characters are given choices; they make choices that reverberate in those lives around them.  Each of these mysteries interestingly enough also treats the theme of love in greater depth and complexity.

  Poirot as portayed by David Suchet, the directing, the ensemble acting, the sets and, for me, just as importantly the music all contribute to create a perfect movie experience.  I stress the music because its quality never falters, never becomes saccharine or distracting, but rather intensifies and enhances the tone and development of the plot and themes.

  Let's hope that A&E, the inimitable David Suchet, the director, producers and well everyone involved continue to bring us more cinematic treasures based on Agatha Christie's timeless mystery creations.",1110240000,19,1389,5.325688073394495
2158725,5,B0006212JK,"Firstly, if you are a fan mostly of the earliest serie, the funny British-French humour between Poirot and Hastings or the sophisticated vs. bon march never-ending conflicts between Poirot and Japp, this is unfortunatly not for you. Although these were originally what made this serie so good, it did get old - and in the end they have finally come up with this DVD set, and these four movies are, by far, the most faithful adaptations of Agatha Christie's books. They have captured Poirot's fatherly love for people who are in distress, and the intense and sharp psychology which has kept people of all ages riveted to their books for almost a century now. We are finally rid of all these unimportant details which always seem to lead in so many novel-movie adaptations and have come to the root, the very source of these stories - the relationships between characters and as a previous review pointed out, the supporting cast in each movie is simply dazzling. David Suchet has perhaps somewhat left his image of the little ridiculous man who walks funny with odd tastes - it's about time, too. I should point out also that the music has changed - and although the original theme was perfectly fitting, it would not have suited anymore and the theme that has replaced it only adds to the sumptuous effect of these movies. This deserves nothing but 5 stars from me.",1109808000,13,1365,4.7154811715481175
2158726,3,B0006212JK,"The video titled Five Little Pigs is up to the standards of a classical Greek tragedy.  This is not surprising as the plot is from a Christie novel and not a modern script writer.

They then went and ruined it by using a hand held camera that wobbles around for many of the scenes. At best you will get eye fatigue and possibly sea sickness.

Sad Cypress is one of the original Christie novels and therefore has a first class plot. Fans of Lovejoy will recognize Phyllis Logan in the role of a nurse.",1109116800,8,500,4.297872340425532
2158727,5,B0006212JK,"Beautifully atmospheric, these four new productions by A&E are a Poirot fan's dream.  Seen on the cable channel in September 2004, the quintessential (now more mature) David Suchet shines in these dark and moody movie-length whodunits.  The pace of each is relaxed and methodical, the adaptation of the four Christie novels is superb.  Though sentimentally missed, the absence of Capt. Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Inspector Japp (who are obviously absent in the original novels as well) is made up for by a stellar cast of Britain's best.  Christopher Gunning continues his expertise in masterful scoring.  Not intended to mimic the past Poirot productions by LWT, these new episodes successfully stand unique in style and feel.

As for the other three films (""The Hollow,"" ""Five Little Pigs,"" and ""Sad Cypress""), they are vintage Poirot: as richly atmospheric and enjoyable as any of the earlier Poirot films, with David Suchet in top form as the eccentric Belgian sleuth.

Also, these latest Poirot mysteries have terrific production values, as you'd expect: the elegant sets and costumes provide lots of period detail that delight the eye.  If you're a fan of stylish whodunits, this is definitely a worthwhile addition to your film library!",1108512000,54,693,4.956896551724138

2158741,5,B0006212JK,"Season 9 was the strongest season for this wonderful series.

Five Little Pigs - a haunting story of murder in retrospect, this filmed version makes very few (but irritating) mistakes.  First, Christie rarely explained character names, but in this story, she does so and, in the first pages!  Yet, despite this introduction to the Crale child, now grown up, Carolyn (aka Carla) Crale is inexplicably renamed ""Lucy.""  Her father's name, artist Amyus (A me us) is mispronounced throughout the film and, finally, a  latent heterosexual unrequited love becomes homosexual (an unfortunate trend of the producers/writers of this series to interject, often inappropriately, once disastrously, a homosexual subplot or theme where none was conceived by the author) but here, it actually works.

Having now disposed of the most blatant and, imho truly pointless changes from the original, this film is a masterpiece.  All acting is top drawer, Toby Stephens, Rachel Stirling and Gemma Jones lead an exceptional cast.  The story is sensitively told and the mystery deliciously revealed.  Christie had a talent for making the reader feel the tragedy of murder and never is it more apparent than with this beautifully told, but tear-jerking story, accentuated by Eric Satie's lovely Gnossienne No. 1.  One of the best in series.

If anything is to be criticized it is the timing of the next film, Sad Cypress, another tearjerker, this one a bittersweet tale of cold-blooded murder.  Televised immediately after Five Little Pigs, I would have reshuffled the sad a bit.  Anyway, on to the film:  Elizabeth Dermott-Walsh is spectacular as Elinor Carlisle, a passionate woman who is coldly reserved on the outside.  Does she truly love Roddy?  Until Mary Gerard's return turns everyone's life upside-down, only Elinor knows of her own passion for Roddy.  Diana Quick is great as Aunt Laura;  the rest of the cast is also superb.  The setting of Huntersbury is beautiful, but very dark.  The story itself is good, but Poirot's presence in the story was, as Christie later conceded, a mistake.  However, that can't be blamed on the filmmakers, who do a lovely job.  Musical scoring is gorgeous and apt.  An excellent entry in the series.

Death on the Nile - Had Mrs. Allerton, Tim Allerton and Rosalind Otterbourne's stories not been so awkwardly perverted (really, the proverbial sore thumb) I would pronounce this ""the"" definitive version.  However, despite this major misstep, this film version manages to best its earlier counterpart (starring Ustinov) in every other way.  First, the role of Jaqueline deBelfour was properly cast, played by a dark-haired, robust beauty, Emma Griffiths Malin, not the waifish and talentless Mia Farrow.  I was rather lukewarm on Emily Blunt as Linnet, but the remaining cast was excellent.  I particularly liked Zoe Telford's portrayal of Rosalind, although Olivia Hussey was also good in the role.  I prefer Telford's portrayal because it felt quite more realistic and natural.  The setting was wonderful, as was the re-inclusion of cousin Cordelia, as well as her ""love triangle"" with Ferguson and Bessner.  Nurse Bowers was left out of this cast, but wasn't really missed.  Apart from the vicious slander done to the Allertons, this is an outstanding version of one of Christie's greatest stories.

The Hollow -- This story never did much for me as a mystery, but as a character study (a change of pace for Christie) it was a bit of fun.  The mystery itself is easy to solve (and early on) but the characters whisk this story away as they obfuscate, misdirect and just plain lie their way through to the end.  The film's setting is absolutely perfect and gorgeous.  Sara Miles and Edward Fox are simply outstanding as Lady Angkatell and Gudgeon;  Meagan Dodds is the perfect Henrietta;  Lysette Anthony does a great turn as a ham actress.  The mystery?  3/10;  film presentation 9/10.",1424995200,,3907,5.080188679245283

2158750,5,B0006212JK,"If you want an introduction to the most methodical depiction of the great Belgian detective, start here!!  The brilliance of these TV movies is all the more remarkable for the fact that they do not feature the recurring Poirot series regulars of Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings, and Inspector Japp.  These movies marked a deliberate step by the production staff of the series to remain more faithful to Agatha Christie's books that DIDN'T feature the trio of regulars.  Having seen a number of the earlier Poirot installments, the tone here is much darker and somber than the earlier ones where a little humor and eccentricity by Poirot et. al was interspersed with perplexing crimes.  The lack of humor in these movies actually ADDS to the value of these TV movies.  Each one has it's own feel, and mood.  ""Five Little Pigs"" flips from the dark, heavy present when Poirot is interviewing each witness to a murder back to the warm, halcyon past when the murder took place.  ""Sad Cypress"" is a dark, moody, and beautifully English as Poirot helps clear a woman of murdering a rival for her fiancee and inheritance.  ""Death on the Nile"" is the best cast, most faithful production of Christie's original novel ever committed to film, as a highly complicated murder is committed on ""the river Nile"".  ""The Hollow"" is the weakest of the four movies, feeling a little long and plodding but still a relatively well put together piece.
David Suchet is the rightfully lauded ""definitive Poirot"", despite the different tones of each murder, Suchet's commitment to the quirky detective is absolute, and he is clearly fond of this sometimes arrogant, always a genius little man.

2158754,4,B0006212JK,"NOTE: This review is sort of a hybrid mix of 5 LITTLE Pigs, the novel & the movie only.

In other reviews of the new series of Christie films on BBC, I mentioned that many of the latest offerings added a decidedly ""Gay"" interpretation of characters & events that may or may not have been the authors' intention. On one hand it's nice that BBC has taken such efforts to promote an openess policy, but is it fair to Christie? Would she have liked to include such details (completely VERBOTEN during her lifetime)? These aren't easy questions, but I think 5 LITTLE PIGS is a good place to start asking.

Other reviewers have indicated that they weren't entirely satisfied with the ending, or with other factors as well. The story is about an artist who, although apparently happily married, always fools around with his current model. The wife, artist & 2 male chums all more or less grew up together. One of the brothers is obviously enamored of the artist, the other with the wife. What Christie did not reveal just HOW enamored the boy was with the artist. There are fleeting scenes in the film showing the boy caressing the artist while he's painting. He seems to allow it has his due. This relationship is briefly explored only in the movie--and yet when you understand it that way, everything falls into place & makes sense (this was Christie's forte).

But what happens when you open it up like this? And I say again, is it fair to Christie? I think that in this particular case, yes it is--but only because she did not or could not have explained this in the original text. This may be one very important factor that caused a sort of disconnect. After all, it makes a LOT of difference if the male friend is in love--not with the artist's wife (as implied in the book)--but with the artist himself.

This is tricky because, after all, we are dealing with one of history's most successful authors.

I liked the film precisely because it did go a little further, but then it's still a question of How far is too far?",1384214400,,2019,4.52054794520548

2158759,5,B0006212JK,"This set features my favorite and my least favorite Poirot movies, along with the most bizarre.

1. DEATH ON THE NILE. I had the privilege of seeing the '78 version with Peter Ustinov. What's interesting is with one exception so far that when I see a Suchet version of a story I saw with Albert Finney or Ustinov, I almost always like Suchet in the role better but prefer the other version. (The exception at this point -- I consider the two ""Lord Edgeware Dies"" versions equal.) As noted, this is not the exception.

One funny item about this: This was the first story Ustinov played in; the last one (Appointment With Death) had David Soul play the American lawyer of the murder victim. Soul appears in this adaptation as ... you guessed it. The American lawyer of the murder victim. Coincidence? I enjoyed it whichever the case.

I haven't read the novel, but this adaptation does not have all the suspects in the room at the end (Ustinov's did). I thought it worked well that way.

2. SAD CYPRESS. I've read this book, in which Poirot is more part of the supporting cast. Of course, that can't happen in this movie series. I actually enjoyed this more than the book, though it has a couple of bizarre scenes, one of which uses horrific special effects. This one has a unique variation of getting all the suspects together that I found enjoyable (even though it includes the other bizarre scene I mentioned). Not one I'd probably watch again, but still one I though was well done.

3. THE HOLLOW.  Let me put it this way: This is the only Agatha Christie novel that makes me think I can take a similar premise and do a better job. One given -- I didn't read the original version. But this is my least favorite Poirot adaptation. This is partially due to a sex scene (characters mostly clothed, but still obvious), but I just didn't like this story. Still, the acting was at the usual standard.

4. FIVE LITTLE PIGS. This is my favorite adaptation. Some reviewers didn't like the jerky, home movie aspect of the recollections of five witnesses to a murder committed fourteen years prior to the story (for which the accused was hanged, and which Poirot investigates at the respect of the daughter who believes her mother's innocent). I'm not one of them -- it adds to the story. Oh, and this is the only one in the set where all the suspects are gathered together as Poirot explains the murder. Should I have given a spoiler alert? I don't think so.

I'll admit, the cover (which is the one selected for the full set) is interesting, but I don't like it because it's taken from the climax of the movie and should come with a spoiler alert.

Overall, I'd recommend this set. True, the films lack the old theme music, but they still are enjoyable.",1378080000,,2746,4.520161290322581

2158773,5,B0006212JK,"The numbers of reviews submitted for the various packages of David Suchet's portrayal of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian detective Hercules Poirot is testament enough as to its popularity, with many going into considerable detail about each episode covered.

I'm not about to clog up the reviews with more of the same. If you know who Poirot is there's no need, and if you don't, many of these other great reviews will fill you in nicely. I simply wish to say that each meticulously portrays the time period (1920s to 1940s before the series reaches its end) as only British productions can, and with actors who do not overplay their roles in sticking as closely as possible to Agatha Christie's books.

As some have noted, the original episodes have more of an Art Deco and often brighter and less-brooding look to them with the semi-regular characters of his aide, Captain Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser), his secretary Miss Felicity Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Scotland Yard Chief Inspector James Harold Japp (Philip Jackson), each of whom more or less faded from Christie's books after entering the mid- to late-1930s.

These later episodes, some of which were produced by the A&E Network but still stuck flawlessly to the period in appearance, began to take on a darker side in their storylines (as did her books), with the only recurring characters being George, his valet, and detective fiction writer Ariadne Oliver (played by the brilliant actress Zo Wannamaker).

The only episodes not yet available on DVD are those of the final season, which were filmed the past year - Elephants Can Remember, The Big Four, The Labours Of Hercules, Dead Man's Folly, and Curtain. The last, which brings our favourite detective, now wheelchair-ridden, back to Styles (now a retirement residence), but where it all began, also sees his death.

It disheartening to really enjoy a book series and find that film production takes too many liberties but this one keeps to Ms Christie's knitting of great mysteries!!,1349481600,,352,4.571428571428571

Also it appears that the mustaches have a different look...a little thinner perhaps. Suchet appears to submerse himself totally into the character and being a big Christie fan I think Poirot and Marple are her greatest creations.
I couldn't decide which of the New Mysteries Collection stories I like best...I like them all equally well.
It saddens me that there won't be more Poirot movies or TV episodes, but at least I have the consolation of owning all the dvds so I can visit with these old friends as the years pass.",1338768000,,693,4.9655172413793105
2158779,5,B0006212JK,David Suchet brings everything one would envision Poirot to be.  The best portrayal of the Belgian detective I have seen.  Great interpretation of Agatha Christie's novels.,1333584000,,172,5.576923076923077
2158780,4,B0006212JK,"""The New Mysteries Collection"" contains 4 feature-length films from ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" that originally aired on Britain's ITV in 2003-2004. This was Series 9 in the UK. It was the year that the producers made big changes to ""Poirot"", which had been running since David Suchet first took on the role of the Belgian sleuth in 1989. They seem to be striving for a darker Poirot for the naughts. The art deco and modernist sets that characterized the series in the 1990s are gone, as is the deco title sequence. Poirot has become more overtly self-righteous, though not to the extent he will in Series 11 and 12. The acting in supporting roles is a little campy, and the characters in ""Death on the Nile"" and ""The Hollows"" are not likeable. Poirot has exchanged his cute mustache for a slightly sinister creation. And the writers have begun making gratuitous changes to Christie's characters.

I confess that I prefer the airy sets and more amiable Poirot of the 1990s. Series 9 is visually and tonally flat. That is in large part due to the absence of Capt. Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Inspector Japp. Poirot's fondness for those people, in spite of his contrasting lifestyle, humanized the fussy Belgian and endeared him to the audience. It is Poirot's unique way of interacting with the world around him that made him appealing. In Series 9, Poirot interacts almost exclusively with suspects and witnesses. David Suchet has subtly changed the detective's mannerism to emphasize his stuffiness and downplay his joviality, making him a bit ill-tempered. Nevertheless, there are some good mysteries here. The show is still entertaining, but no longer out-of-the-ordinary. The only bonus features on the A&E DVDs (2005) are 3 brief text bios of David Suchet, Agatha Christie, and Hercule Poirot. No subtitles. The mysteries are:

""Five Little Pigs"" opens with the execution of Caroline Crale (Rachael Stirling) for the murder of her husband, the painter Amyas Crale (Aiden Gillen). Fourteen years later, their daughter Lucy (Aimee Mullins) asks Poirot to investigate the case. Her mother assured her that she was innocent. Lucy would like to know the truth. There were 5 guests at the Crale home the weekend that Amyas died, and therefore 5 suspects: Amyas' best friend Philip Blake (Toby Stephens), neighbor and Philip's brother Meredith (Marc Warren), Amyas' young mistress and subject of his most recent painting Elsa Greer (Julie Cox), Caroline's sister Angela (Sophie Winkleman), and Angela's tutor Miss Williams (Gemma Jones). Most of the witnesses had motive to murder Amyas Crale, but most are confident in Caroline's guilt. Poirot begins to doubt it, however.

In ""Sad Cypress"", Poirot's old friend Dr. Peter Lord (Paul McGann) asks the detective to investigate a letter that has distressed a friend of his, Miss Elinor Carlisle (Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh). Elinor and her fianc Roddy Winter (Rupert Penry-Jones) are visiting her Aunt Laura (Diana Quick) at her country home, because Elinor received an anonymous letter claiming that someone was scheming to convince Aunt Laura to disinherit her. Poirot thinks the motive behind the letter is serious, rather than a vicious prank. So he is not entirely surprised when, after the death of Aunt Laura, followed by that of Mary Gerrard (Kelly Reilly), the gardener's daughter and a rival for Roddy's affections, Elinor is accused of murdering both of them. Secrets from the past are the necessary clues for Poirot to solve the crime and stage an eleventh hour rescue of Elinor.

""Death on the Nile"" finds Poirot on holiday in Egypt when he takes a Nile cruise with a group of fellow tourists. Jackie de Bellefort (Emma Griffiths Malin) is stalking the wealthy Linnet Doyle (Emily Blunt) and her new husband Simon (J.J. Field), whom Linnet stole from Jackie. There is the flamboyant novelist Salome Otterbourne (Frances de la Tour), traveling with her embittered daughter Rosalie (Zoe Telford), and the American socialite Marie Van Schuyler (Judy Parfitt), who ill-treats her mousy cousin Cornelia (Daisy Donovan).They're all confined to the same ship with a gruff Austrian physician (Steve Pemberton), an ill-tempered communist (Alastair Mackenzie), the snobbish Allertons,  and Linnet's American trustee. So many potential victims and suspects. Yet we know that it must be the lovely and most widely hated Linnet who will die. And the murders don't stop there.

In ""The Hollow"", Poirot (David Suchet) plans to spend a relaxing weekend in a country cottage. Upon his arrival, he finds that Lady Angkatell (Sarah Miles) has invited him to dinner at The Hollow, her nearby estate. Dining with them are her husband Sir Henry (Edward Hardwicke), son Edward (Jamie de Courcey), cousin Henrietta (Megan Dodds), who is a sculptor, and cousin Gerda (Claire Price) and her philandering physician husband John Christow (Jonathan Cake). And an obnoxious actress, Veronica Cray (Lysette Anthony), former lover of John's, crashes the party looking for a box of matches. The next day, John is found shot to death by the pool, wife Gerda standing over him with a revolver. But she is not the only woman with motive to kill John. The cast is all right, but this mystery has a dull, too simple plot.",1316217600,,5236,5.103850641773629

2158782,3,B0006212JK,"'Death on the Nile' (3) - Poirot takes a cruise on the Nile.  On board: a husband, wife, and a jilted woman who is bent on making their lives miserable.  Tempers flare, shots are fired, and murders take place.  This version was disappointing: story flow is somewhat unclear; characters indistinct.  A far better version: the film with Peter Ustinov as Poirot.

'Sad Cypress' (4) - Eleanor receives an anonymous letter intimating someone who - may seem as white as snow - intends to hasten her rich aunt's death.  Poirot investigates; someone is murdered; and Eleanor is accused, convicted, and sentenced to death.  Cropping problem: when two notes are in closeup, it is difficult to guess the missing words.

'The Hollow' (4) - Poirot, on holiday in the country, receives invitations to dinner and a Sunday lunch to play a murder game.  He arrives upon the staged scene; disquiet fills him; a swipe of his finger in the blood tells him this is no game!  Distraction problem: varying white lines at the top of the screen.  To hide this defect, try adjusting your TV's display area.

'Five Little Pigs' (1) - Poirot reviews an old murder case; the accused had been hanged.  He interviews 5 people and they tell to him their memories surrounding the murder.  These lengthy memory sequences are almost unwatchable.  They were filmed with incredibly jerky camera movements.  If you are prone to nausea, you may wish to skip this one.

Extras: Written bios of Suchet and Christie.  List of Poirot stories.  Trivia: Two of the above movies are not listed.  The reason: 'The Hollow' also goes by the title 'Murder After Hours' and 'Five Little Pigs' by the title 'Murder in Retrospect'.

2158793,4,B0006212JK,"This set, ""Agatha Christie's Poirot - The New Mysteries Collection,"" consists of four of Dame Agatha's Poirot novels dramatized at TV feature length.  The four novels are ""Death on the Nile"" (1937), ""Sad Cypress"" (1940), ""Five Little Pigs"" (1942) and ""The Hollow"" (1946).  Four other novels are dramatized in the companion set, ""Agatha Christie's Poirot - Classic Crimes Collection.""  The two sets contain the output of the new A&E production team.

The new series diverge from the old in a number of ways.  They concentrate on Christie's novel-length works rather than her short stories.  Far more important to Amazon reviewers, though, seems to be the change in casting.  The dim but endearing Captain Hastings, the hyper-efficient Miss Lemon and that stolid plod, Chief Inspector Japp are all gone.  We find Poirot alone in his new, smaller, gloomier, distinctly less impressive flat--although he's apparently still in the same building.  Some note that the new scripts make references to modern sexual sensibilities that certainly, unquestionably, indubitably did not appear in Dame Aggie's writings.  Typical reactions among those who mention this change involve one or all of dismay, disgust and disdain.  Others have drawn attention to production values for the new series.  One reviewer put it this way: ""[T]he production value of the films has gone through the roof.  Simply put, these are the best looking Poirot films made so far, particularly with regards to `film moment' shots and the use of color in regards to theme.""  Finally, there has been the obvious effect of all-devouring time; the now portly Suchet is sixty-ish and he looks it.

Let's consider that point, the older Poirot.  In 1920, Hercule Poirot appeared in Agatha Christie's first book, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles,"" a novel set in the middle of the First World War.  Captain Hastings, wounded on the Western Front, is back in England to recover.  He happens to meet an odd little man named Hercule Poirot (a name plainly impossible for any self-respecting Englishman to pronounce correctly.)  Poirot is described as an elderly Belgian refugee who is a retired policeman.  Considering the events that took place in Belgium in the late summer of 1914, it must be assumed that he retired no later than the first half that year.  If Poirot retired at sixty--Christie writing at age 30 would probably have considered that to be elderly--he was born no later than 1854.  If at sixty-five, then 1851.  The earlier his retirement, the earlier his birth date.

Poirot's career in England stretched from the horrors of the Western Front to what he and his creator clearly regarded as the only slightly less baleful era of rock 'n roll.  For production convenience, the original series was set in 1935.  1937 seems to be the date for this series, considering that the name of a certain Mrs Simpson appears in the newspapers.  In 1937, Hercule Poirot must have been at least 83 years old.  All things considered, David Suchet was and still remains entirely too young for the part.

In 1916, Agatha Miller Christie was thinking about writing a book for pin money.  (Monetary cpnsiderations aside, her older sister had bet her she couldn't do it!)  She and her dashing husband Archie Christie were bright young things, but on their beam ends financially.  She wrote letter to a friend in which she whined that they could afford only two servants.  She decided to write a mystery.  At the time, there was only one true pattern for a detective and its name was S. Holmes, still very much a living literary figure.  Twelve stories of his Canon were yet to be written and they wouldn't be published between hard covers until 1927 with ""The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes.""  After collecting a set of galling rejections, Agatha's first book, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" and Hercule Poirot saw print in 1920.

Holmes had a biographer named Watson, plodding colleagues at Scotland Yard, beginning with Inspector Lestrade, and a landlady-housekeeper, Mrs Hudson.  Following the set pattern, Christie gave Poirot his biographer in Captain Hastings--the complete boob that Watson NEVER was--and he introduced Inspector Japp.  Later, Poirot would find his London flat and enjoy the ministrations of Miss Lemon.  In all but a single short story, she is a background figure.

In the older TV series, Hastings got into everything.  Miss Lemon's role expanded beyond anything in Christie's writings.  All police detectives combined into Chief Inspector Japp.  All this, first to humanize the little Belgian detective, then to ease the endless task of explaining plot points.

In 1926, Christie hit the big time with ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.""  She was universally acknowledged as the great successor to Conan Doyle.  But Hastings wasn't even in ""Ackroyd.""  She realized that she had no need to follow Holmes anymore, so she sent the tedious Hastings off to molt in some remote South American exile, bringing him back only on a rare, sentimental occasion.

In this Hastings-, Lemon- and Japp-free series, the new producers have done no more than follow Christie's lead.  Nevertheless, I miss them, just as I sometimes miss them in the written versions.  The producers really ought to bring them back for at least one show in each season.

Regarding post-Christie sensibilities on sexual matters, heaven knows it's mild enough stuff in these productions, but why do they bother?  The stories are set in 1937, not 2007 or even 1977.  Whatever people were doing then, they certainly were not talking about it freely, as here.  (Yes, I am perfectly aware of such people as Sackville-West and Trefusis, but that was a juicy scandal, not a casual aside as in ""The Hollow."")

Finally, there are the production values.  Some reviewers are impressed.  I am not.  Whatever the current producers are paying, they are not getting their money's worth.  The old series was a gem.  Remember those opening graphics?  And that annoying but unforgettable theme music?  The old series showcased Art Deco artifacts and architecture.  The Deco movement peaked, then fell away in hardly more than a decade--two at most.  I am convinced the old series showcased every good example of Art Deco architecture to be found in all of Britain.  By contrast, the new series is flat and uninteresting.  Instead of bright, clean-lined Art Deco, we are shown nothing but the same-old-same-old Masterpiece Theater/A&E Presents visual blahs that turn up a dozen times a week on PBS.  Even worse is the rhythm of the new series.  Several times in each episode, with the regularity--not to mention the soul--of a stopwatch, everything comes lurching to a halt.  (Why they do not display a card saying ""Insert Commercial Here"" I cannot imagine.)  And the music!  That old tune is still there, but almost inaudible in the background.  What a waste!  Let's not even talk about the opening credits.

In summary, these are acceptable, if sometimes VERY loose adaptations of Christie's mid-career novels.  They're OK, but they are not the visual treats they used to be.  On the other hand, even mediocre Poirot is better than no Poirot at all.

2158802,4,B0006212JK,"Hercule Poirot is a fussy, brainy little Belgian, and he seems like an unlikely detective in a series of veddy veddy British murder mysteries. But Agatha Christie's most likable detective turns up again in a quartet of new TV movies: one of her most popular, and three of her most atmospheric and baffling.

""Death on the Nile"" introduces us to a lethal love triangle: a beautiful heiress, her penniless new husband, and the vibrant ex-girlfriend, who is also an ex-pal of the heiress. Soon Linnett Doyle (Emily Blunt) is dead, and her ex-pal and widowed husband are the only people who COULDN'T have done it. But it seems that she had a wealth of enemies, including a disgruntled communist, pearl thief, and a drunken romance novelist. And it's up to Hercule Poirot to figure out what really did happen...

Another lethal love triangle crops up in ""Sad Cypress."" An old woman dies, seemingly of natural causes, leaving her vast estate to her young relative Elinor (Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh). But when Elinor's fiancee leaves her for lovely Mary Gerard (Kelly Reilly), Mary turns up dead -- and the only suspect is Elinor. Poirot knows she wanted to -- but did she?

In ""The Hollow,"" doctor John Christow (Jonathan Cake) is shot at the poolside, and his timid wife is found holding the gun. Love is the probable answer: Was it his steel-nerved mistress (Megan Dodds), the young man in love with her (Jamie de Courcey) his quiet and seemingly stupid wife (Claire Price), or an angry ex-flame (Lysette Anthony) with whom he had had a quickie in the pavilion? Only Hercule Poirot is clever enough to unravel this bizarrely simple mystery...

""Five Little Pigs"" takes Poirot to a ""cold case"" -- fourteen years after Caroline Crale (Rachael Stirling) seemingly murdered her cheating husband Amyas (Aidan Gillen), her daughter Lucy (Aimee Mullins) asks Poirot to somehow clear her long-dead mother's name. He agrees to look into it, and soon finds a pattern of clues centering on Amyas, Caroline, her younger sister, his mistress/model, and his boyhood friend...

Don't expect these movies to have quite the same feel as the TV series. Those stories were lightened by the presence of clueless sidekick Hastings; without him, a darker tone enters the movies. Sure, the English counterpoints that Hastings and Miss Lemon brought are missing, but it doesn't make these movies bad, merely different.

""Death on the Nile"" is the only movie that can be compared to another production; Salome Otterbourne is dour rather than funny, and the film has a lack of Egyptian settings. It's okay, but not great. The other movies are really the outstanding ones, especially since the filmmakers include Christie's studies of ""the psychology.""

They are also populated by a bevy of wonderful characters: ice-cold artists, flaky ladies-of-the-manor, seductive bombshells, imperious heiresses, and bewitching teenagers. And they are set in a variety of different places, like English manorhouses, cruise ships, and volatile artists' households.

British actor Suchet has been playing the dapper Belgian for years, and has surpassed Peter Ustinov as the best Poirot. He's in good form here, with little details that show us Poirot's ""little grey cells"" and his passion for order. One of his best scenes has Poirot faking poison symptoms, then looking up with a catlike smirk at the would-be murderer.

Another Poirot TV movie is currently in production, but in the meantime, check out the ""New Mysteries Collection."" The Egyptian film is rather lackluster, but the remaining three are solid, suspenseful, and intelligent.",1125619200,37,3593,5.117747440273037

2158805,5,B0006212JK,"As usual, the casting and cinematography of the Poirot series are superb.  There is little in North America to compare with the production value of the British series.

There is a thematic difference between the past Poirot productions and this one, and it is reflected in the fact that the currect series is of a darker and more humorless presentation.  Hastings is missing.  Miss Lemon is missing.  The occasional comic relief from the seriousness of the subject matter is missing.

Of course interpretation depends upon the directors, producers, and writers.  In spite of this, I can but give five stars to the overall series production and recommend it to all those who seek entertainment fare which is out of the world of the mundane which we are subjected to each day.",1121817600,4,774,4.862595419847328
2158806,1,B0006212JK,"I'll have to say that I was disgusted with the change in production for the ""New"" Poirot movies. Granted, the filming is quite modernized and very appealing, but the wholesomeness that the older movies had is severely lacking in these 4 videos. I only watched two of them, and decided to send the whole set back. I'm staying with the old colored sets. The production may be cheaper, but I thoroughly enjoyed every one, and that's the Poirot I want to see!

Lastly, and maybe the least, the familiar (maybe annoying to some) theme song is sadly missing.

I hope that any new videos may go back to the same wonderful nostalgia that I've come to enjoy with Acorn Media films.",1120694400,12,672,4.545454545454546

2158808,5,B0006212JK,"These new DVDs mark the beginning of Poirot films made by the new company that got the rights.

So what's the difference? First, the opening theme is gone. However, they still keep traces of that old familiar medley throughout the films if you listen closely enough.

Secondly, the production value of the films has gone through the roof. Simply put, these are the best looking Poirot films made so far, particularly with regards to ""film moment"" shots and the use of color in regards to theme.

Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly for fans of the ""old"" Poirot series, there is significantly more sexual content in each of these four films. Wheras the original series would only go as far as implication, we get sex scenes or glimpses of sex scenes that would warrant a PG-13 rating (though not an R). The only exception to this is Sad Cypress, which has only dialogue and implication. I would hope that the next films made will have less of this and be more like the original series in this respect, but perhaps I hope too much...

Having said that, I found these DVDs to be just as good as the original series and well-worth the buy. The casting is still superb, the look of the films are impressive, and David Suchet is just as good and as fun to watch as he's ever been. the Hence the 5 star rating. With that, here is a run-down of the films:

DEATH ON THE NILE: Curiously, while this is one of the most famous Poirot stories, it is the weakest of the four films. This is almost certainly the first of these films made, as the directing is off (with several two-second shots) and the story feels rushed. This film needed at least an extra half-hour spent on the mystery itself, so as to make the actual problem and thus the mystery itself to be more complex. Instead, it rushes through the story while giving us less time with the characters, less time on the puzzle, and too much time trying to introduce more characters and ideas. Having said all of that, it is still quite good and at least as good as the Ustinov version.

SAD CYPRESS: This is the second-worst Poirot mystery Agatha Christie wrote, but curiously enough it is a very entertaining watch...one of the few instances where it is better to watch the movie rather than read the book. The film knows that the actual mystery is not that complex, so it shorterns the story and accelerates through the story. Major hints in the book are also elminated to make it just a tad bit harder to figure out who the murderer is.

THE HOLLOW: Like Sad Cypress, this is not one of the best mysteries to read, but a fun one to watch. Short and sweet, my only complaint is the ending. It is a total copout from the way the book ends.

FIVE LITTLE PIGS: This is the best of the four DVDs. The story involves Poirot trying to solve a crime that occurred sixteen years ago by interviewing the witnesses in the case and balancing out their narratives. It is one of Agatha Christie's best mysteries, and the film does it justice. It is nearly on the level of the truly great Poirot films such as The ABC Murders, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Murder on the Link and Hercule Poirot's Christmas. However, I cannot place it on that level for one reason alone: The last two minutes of the film are unnecessary and should have been deleted so as to end where the books ends.

All in all, I am quite pleased with this company that has finally gotten the hang of Poirot after one film and has the ability to make even the worst mysteries interesting. Well worth the buy and the time to watch.",1119571200,7,3533,4.4314329738058555
2158809,3,B0006212JK,"While, thanks to the wonderful presence of David Suchet, this collection of Poirot is enjoyable - they are just not as good as the Acorn releases. Trivially, that delightful theme is missing. Not so trivially, this collection relies on the tawdry and sensational rather than the characters and plot, as the previous collections did.

Overall, good but not as good as Acorn's.",1119052800,5,375,5.048387096774194

So now we'll watch them all.

Last night we watched ""The Hollow"" (2004). It's excellent!
The composer from ""Firelight"" (a movie with Sophie Marceau) outdid himself with a very beautiful score. The cinematographer filmed lovely scenes in the British countryside.

They add things to the plots that were not in the books, and the additions, IMO, detract rather than add to the stories. They are also rather sad, compared to the older hour long episodes, with very little humor to lighten their serious nature. I would recommend these only if you are a die-hard fan and- like me- want to see every Poirot David Suchet made. If you're new to Poirot, get some of the sets that contain his hour-long episodes. Much more humorous and enjoyable plots!",1478908800,,580,4.481132075471698
