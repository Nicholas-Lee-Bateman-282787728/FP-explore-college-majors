7905265,4,B000007T82,"Sort of Ken Loach meets an after-school special - though far better
than that sounds.

A somewhat clich plot  - young man in trouble is given one last chance,
sent to live with his estranged, poor father who raises horses, and
grows up in the process.

So the story is a bit old hat, even boring and slow at moments, but the details
and performances are hyper real and subtle, and very rich.  And it's all
aided by subtle, quietly beautiful photography.  In the end the
familiarity of the general is outweighed by the freshness of the
specifics.

Made by the Amber Production Team, a UK collective who make
interesting, low budget, slice-of-life films as a group effort.",1283904000,,670,4.635593220338983
7905266,5,B000007T82,"A British ""dogme"" film?  Made by the Amber Production Team, and starring the magnificently weatherbeaten Brian Hogg along with the homely-yet-magnetic Darren Bell, as Hogg's ne'er-do-well son, raised in the city as a troubled latchkey kid, and back on the farm after a scrape with the law.  A brilliant depictation of the abruptly rural culture in backwoods Yorkshire, this film combines professional actors and locals to weave a charming, if ultimately rather bleak picture of country life modern Britain.  (A real eye-opener for anyone lamenting the loss of the olden days... they ain't gone anywhere up there, apparently...)  Clean, compelling storytelling, and a nice departure from the too-smooth predictability of Hollywood and its imitators.  Plus, a fascinating glimpse into the world of the horseracing style known as ""trotting.""",1039737600,,838,5.515625
