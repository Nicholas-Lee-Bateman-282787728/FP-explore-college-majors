7825404,5,6302426553,"Liquid Dreams is a dreamy movie set in the near future. It seems that in this near furure people express and pleasure themselves sexually with other forms rather then actual intimacy. These other forms can be strip clubs, orgasim induced injections, and a Cable T.V channel calld N.V.( Neurovid) but never sex. The movie stars Decesaed actress Candace Daly as Eve  a woman who attempts to visit her sisiter in a futursitc dormatory where they produce the cable Channel Neurovid. She gets picked up by a taxi driver played by John Doe from the punk band X. The movies really premise is really hypnotic and strange. The movie is campy and interesting and a perfect antedote if you enjoy the Midnight Movie Circuit. There aresevreal cameos in the movie of cult film stars like Mink Stole, The Late Paul Bartel and Juan Fernandez who recently played the killer in The Movie ""The Collector. If you like strange, weird movies with crazy lines and absurd story line then my verdict would have to be a solid Yes on this one.",1279584000,,1016,4.675977653631285

Candace Daly from ""Young & the Resteless"" & Richard Steinmetz from ""Loving"". Daly star as Eve Black a former stripper who moves from kansas to live with her sister Tina. Tina works as an exotic Dancer in a  highrise Erotic dormatory where the fim a cable T.V> show called N. V. (neurovid- as they call it). As sonn as Eve arrives at her sister's, she discoveries her sister Tina's body in her bathtub. Eve goes under cover in the club & gets  job as a dancer while scrapping together clues to solve her sisters murder. Leutenant Tredino also helps Eve on this mystery hunt. What they both discover is deadly secrtes  & more strange mysteries.  Eve starts off as a Taxi dancer ang overnight becomes big star in the world of neurovid. This movie seems to be loosley inspired by the movies ""Videodrome & ""liquid sky.  I loved this small film  Its not a masterpiece but it is one strange piece of overlooked film in the history of cult cinema . This movie hasn't caught the attention of the cult film circuit as of yet. I hope by writing this article that it can perhaps bring some promotion to this over looked film . This movie also has appeareneces by cult film stars paul Bartal & mink stole from ""john Waters fame  This film was directed by Mark Manos who's direceted two other films that I Know of ""Josh Kirby...Time Warrior!: Eggs from 70 Million B.C. ~  (1996) &

 Huntress:Spirit of the Night (1995) It would be awsome if Mr manos would consider a sequel to this much overlooked film.",1170547200,2,1595,4.4655172413793105
