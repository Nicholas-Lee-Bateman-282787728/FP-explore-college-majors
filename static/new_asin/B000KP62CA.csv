8158568,4,B000KP62CA,"A little something from The Williams Brothers, Canton Spirituals, Lee Williams and Slim & The Supreme Angels. Four of my favorite groups today in the quartette field. Harvey, as usual, knows how to hook an audience when he does 'I'm In Your Care,' Williams Brothers do a nice rendition of 'Up Where We Belong,' Supreme Angels give us 'Miracle,' and Lee Williams sings a song about the hills we've already come over. Christianaires and Hip Boot Slim are on here too. But, they don't impress me like the aforementioned groups. Disc is only an hour. Still, it's an hour well spent.",1213660800,6,578,4.732673267326732
