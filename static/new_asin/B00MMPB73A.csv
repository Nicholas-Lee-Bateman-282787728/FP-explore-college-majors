6589077,5,B00MMPB73A,"My girls love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. This DVD contains four episodes from the Disney Jr. cartoon. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. Minnie's Winter Bow Show (Full Length Feature) - Minnie and her nieces accidentally take a hot-air baloon ride to the Clubhouse North Pole and need Snow Fairy Clarabelle's help to get back in time for Minnie's big bow show.
2. Martian Minnie's Tea Party - Minnie's Martian double needs help planning a tea party on Mars.
3. Sea Captain Mickey - Mickey and the gang go on a submarine adventure looking for something big in Mickey Lake.
4. Chef Goofy On The Go - Goofy needs help opening a delivery service.

Bonus Episodes:  10 ""Minnie's Bow-Toon"" Shorts",1415836800,68,778,4.664233576642336
6589078,5,B00MMPB73A,Our granddaughters favorite DVD. Have seen it over and over and she still loves it.  Great video for young children..,1452038400,,117,4.85
6589079,5,B00MMPB73A,"My 2 y.o. daughter absolutely loves Minnie Mouse and she LOVES this movie/episode. She can't get enough of it. She requests to watch it on a daily basis and would probably watch it all day, every day if I allowed it. It has catchy little songs that I always find myself humming throughout the day because of how often I hear them. I like that there are more episodes that follow Minnie's Winter Bow Show. You really get your money's worth.",1446854400,,439,4.432098765432099

6589081,5,B00MMPB73A,"Great DVD. The episodes are fun. Only complaint is the Bow-toons don't play on Fast-track. We only watch these in the van - I can't control it go play the Bow-toons unless I go in the back and go to the menu with the remote. That hasn't happened, so they have gone unwatched. But my daughter enjoys the 4 episodes, so it's not a huge deal. And we haven't seen the other episodes before, so that was a huge bonus!",1431475200,,412,4.1625

6589101,1,B00MMPB73A,We ordered this DVD twice now...it looks cute as both daughter's LOVE Mickey...Just wish we could watch it.  But for some reason both DVD's we received (had to return the first one...just received the second one) they are both defective.  They do turn on...they just freeze and skip and don't actually play the movie itself.  If you look at the physical DVD itself underneath where the DVD is played...you can see a haze or a fog in it and the lines are all swirly and rainbowy rather than clean.  I'll be returning it again...hopefully I can get a replacement that works.  It's just frustrating having to continuously return an item due to the manufacturers error.,1420416000,4,665,4.747826086956522

8673059,5,B00MMPB73A,"She loves it.  Really nice and a lot of content, although the bow-toons episodes appear to be a combination of season 3,4 and 5.  Not Season 3 as stated.

The Ten Minnie's Bow Toons included as bonus features are:
(Season 3)
1. A Walk In The Park
2. Freaky Fowl Day
3. Primped Up Pachyderm
4. Gondola With The Wind
5. Uh Oh, Pizza Dough
Season 4
6. Fiesta Follies
7. Royal Delivery
8. Kabuki Chaos
Season 5
9. Happy Campers
10. Picnic Panic

Either that or the internet is wrong, finding information about the Bow-Toons is not easy.  However, I know Season 3's Tricky Treats is on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey's Monster Musical DVD and universally that is acknowledged as the start of Season 3 of Minnie's Bow-Toons and Season 4's Alarm Clocked Out and Rooftop Repair is on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse:  Pop Star Minnie DVD.  Season 1 of Minnie's Bow-Toons is on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse The Wizard Of Dizz DVD and Season 2 of Minnie's Bow-Toons is on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Minnie-Rella DVD.  Beyond that, I have no idea where the remaining Season 3, 4 and 5 episodes are or if they haven't been released yet.

Great product though, good fun, she loved it and it kept her attention.",1465776000,3,1178,4.545023696682464
