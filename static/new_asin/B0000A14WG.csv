1900573,5,B0000A14WG,"Lets face it - no one wants to sit through 5 minutes of comercials on BBC just to see two scenes of a show and then more comercials!

That's why it's so great that two (or maybe three) of the best actor(Patrick McGoohan!)'s best shows (this and the Prisoner) are now on DVD!  No comercials! No BBC! And all the episodes are in order!  (Or, as w/the Prisoner, as close to it as possible)

And of course John Drake is better than Bond! Just in case you have to ask why, I'll tell you: because McGoohan was a good Catholic spy (or as close to it as possible)!!

With the half-hour 'Danger Man' show, you were left wondering how anyone could mistake Drake for No. 6.  I mean, the first season's character was too down to earth to get mixed up in all that trouble.
After watching the 'new' Drake, however, I am personally left with no doubt about whether or not he is going to the Village.

Even if you havn't seen the Prisoner (or are just unmutual), Danger Man/Secret Agent Man is a great show!!

PS - the 'Secret Agent' mega set (the multi-colored, really big one) contains different seasons than the 'Danger Man' mega set (the five-volume, orange one)",1104624000,21,1150,4.3915094339622645
1900574,5,B0000A14WG,"`Secret Agent' was the series that preceded Patrick McGoohan's `The Prisoner'.  Having seen `Secret Agent' for the first time makes you understand `The Prisoner' much more.  The agent that resigned in `The Prisoner' is probably John Drake of  `Secret Agent'.  It was a brilliant espionage TV series with many ideas that were later seen in the `James Bond' movies and `Mission Impossible'.  It was brilliantly written and played and although most of the episodes are in black and white, it doesn't make much difference as long as it is so fascinating and reliable.  It really stands the test of time.  Every episode is different than the other but they all involve spy games.  The quality of the series exceeds anything we see today.

So Patrick, why did you resign?",1095465600,17,765,4.868217054263566
1900575,5,B0000A14WG,"I discovered this series on KTEH 54-San Jose, a local PBS station, and I was astounded by the quality of the acting and of the writing.  The dialogue is simply outstanding and far outpaces anything you will see on primetime tv today featuring the work of many well-known directors like Peter Yates (Bullitt), who are well-respected in the UK and abroad.

I think John Drake is the epitome of cool--examine the icy interchange between Darren Nesbitt and McGoohan in ""Sting in the Tail"" for example--you will be riveted to the screen.  Supporting cast include reliable, stock actors from the ITC stable and some notable British film stars like John Fraser, Bernard Lee, (M from the James Bond films) and Finlay Currie.

Personally, I never grow tired watching these expertly written episodes over and over again--a product of Great Britain's when it still had something resembling an empire. The strength in Secret Agent lies in the scripts, characterization of the lead (McGoohan), and the gritty realism portrayed. In fact, McGoohan directed several of the episodes including ""The Paper Chase"" which has some whimsical, if not humorous, elements to it--I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say Drake's means of eluding the bad guys in this installment is a go-kart!

Drake is not infalliable and does not always win the day: watch the episode ""Judgment Day"" and see why. Personally, these hour long episodes are far superior than the 30 minute ""Danger Man"" episodes that were produced a few years before.

Secret Agent is played seriously--not like the candy coated sci fi James Bond ""espionage entertainments"" served up by Brosnan and Co. ridiculously replete with cars that fly or laden with machine guns and death rays.  No, here is an agent that, although an expert marksman, refuses to use a gun, but instead relies on his wits to get the job done.

Take my word for it,  Secret Agent Mega set is the ticket to hours of viewing pleasure and an interesting window into Cold War politics and intrigue--Enjoy!",1092009600,20,2015,4.920353982300885

I am so glad to see all of these classic TV shows coming out on DVD. As far as i'm concerned, today's television is mostly crap.

1900587,5,B0000A14WG,"When I was little, I remember few things. I remember a theme song (Johnny River's SECRET AGENT MAN), and bits & pieces - images in black and white, a man, who was a spy (or as a character says in one episode, THE UBIQUITOUS MR. LOVEGROVE, '...an agent who travels...'), and the music - that harpsichord.

As I grew up (this was before the internet, so I didn't have the luxury of seeing more than pieces of it here and there), the pieces I DID see only made the series ever more important for me to see.

Early in 1980, the local station (WNBC, for my fellow NYC'ers) started to show on Friday night at 2am, repeats of the hour long series of SECRET AGENT (that's what it was called here, though it's real title is/was DANGER MAN). I made sure I was home (and awake) to watch these, and as this was before VCR's (kids don't realise how lucky they are), I had no way of recording these episodes, other than a sound recording I'd make with my tape recorder, just so I could at least LISTEN...

There was no way to buy this - or any other - older television shows. It's as though they'd 'vanish' into the ether - only a memory was left.

Time's have changed, and A&E, in conjunction with Carlton, brought back the remastered series. It was available in several (confusing) configurations; double disks, (2!) box sets...

To make it even worse, after a relatively short time, A&E stopped selling them.

I finally found it all available here on AMAZON. I cannot begin to say how eagerly I awaited the DVD's to arrive, and unlike the disappointment most feel about something (or someone) they haven't seen, or haven't seen in a long time, those memories only strengthened the actual viewing.

I'm not going to give an episode-by-episode synopsis. Suffice it to say, Patrick McGoohan (who was asked to play James Bond BEFORE Sean Connery - and recommended him for that job - and was asked...AGAIN when Connery left!) plays what is arguably most sophisticated, anti-clich&eacute;d image of the spy at that time. He was NOT after the girl, he DIDN'T have loads of gadgets, he NEVER carried a gun, the spies (or bad guys) were NOT these over-sized, megalomaniacs (of which Mike Myers later spoofed).

Instead, the man Patrick McGoohan played was driven. He never carried a gun, and even though several women made overtures, he never acted upon them. This show, and it's characters form a tightly built 'machine,' one of the few times that the 'powers that be' - the programming heads of the time - actually helped craft what is an immensely entertaining, well-written series.

The hour-long series are (actually) part of the John Drake/#6 trilogy (I'm a firm believer he IS #6), where - for those of us who are fans of THE PRISONER, can see how - as time progressed, the character of John Drake becomes more disenfranchised, more unaccepting of authority always being right, and that problems he faces in his job are NOT black and white.

I implore ANYONE who wants to see what a series CAN do when you've got the talent to create it, to watch this series.

(As I said, the whole confusion of the multiple configurations this series is available as, I'd say that THIS box set, the DANGER MAN AKA SECRET AGENT MEGASET is the best. For those who have this series, and either never new of, or want the 1/2 hour series that came before these, I recommend the DANGER MAN 5-disk box set, of which also wrote a review. I say all of this because, if you're not careful, you'll end up buying copies of episodes you've already got).

1900588,5,B0000A14WG,"I am a retired American, and so I go all the way back to the beginning of American television, in other words, Milton Berle and Gorgeous George.  You can always tell the mark of the genius when you see a Frank Lloyd Wright house, the camera work of Orson Welles, or the direction of John Drake, Secret Agent.  Whether the subject is black and white television or, later on, color television; John Drake, Secret Agent, yes, in black and white, was the best television series ever made.",1248393600,4,484,4.551724137931035
1900589,5,B0000A14WG,"This is a most excellent collection of the secret agent genre for '60's British television.  I grew up enjoying all the secret agent stuff and remembered the tv show (barely) but have had a wonderful time watching the programs unfold with every episode.  The late Patrick McGoohan, as agent John Drake, is very clever and passionate in following out orders for the betterment of mankind.  As a lead-in for his ""Prisoner"" series, I am seeing seeds of his classic show nurture and enjoying all the twists for a smart television show.  Excellent... a must have for any spy collection.",1232409600,,581,4.838383838383838
1900590,5,B0000A14WG,"Remarkably, this show had entire sequences spoken in foreign languages with no sub-titles.  The show is that sophisticated....It really demands a lot from its audience and I, for one, am GRATEFUL for that.

There are sequences in French, Arabic, Greek, and Italian...you either need to understand the languages or figure out what's being said via the context (which is what I did).

I'm thankful that the producers never dumbed the show down for the audience.  If the script called for a conversation in a foreign tongue, they shot the scene...just that way!  No phony foreign accents and no sub-titles.

I actually don't mind not having the subtitles...more challenging.

To the reviewer whose Dad couldn't undestand the show because of the ""heavy foreign accents"", look again!

The art direction on this show was first rate...I could never understand how they could afford building brand new sets from week-to-week...sets that would never be used again. They also did quite a bit of location shooting...also surprising (and expensive!).  If you like to travel, this is a great way to do it because Drake goes everywhere (the Middle East included).

The action sequences are tough, very physical, and exciting!  McGoohan did most (if not all) of his own fighting in the show and he's very, VERY good at it.  Lots of judo throws and the like.  Hard to believe that the producers let him do so much (although, with his intensity, he probably INSISTED on it).

The other thing I really like are all of the opportunities for romance with exotic, stunningly beautiful women that are routinely passed up by Drake!  Refreshing.

There is one episode though (the one with the song ""Mia Amore Sta Lontano"" in it) where he thinks about it a little.  He seems to actually like the girl in this one and has a hard time avoiding getting entangled with her!  Great episode.

But they ALL are.

P.S. Very cool hearing the Zombies ""She's Not There"" in French--when it was a brand new song! Amazing show.",1200873600,3,1988,4.8601190476190474
1900591,4,B0000A14WG,"John Drake, English secret agent, travels around the world defeating the enemies of the Free World, whether they're working for the Communist Chinese, the Soviets or just some out to help themselves. Very well done, and you can see some of the skill that would later go into The Prisoner series. You can certainly see how the character in The Prisoner resembles John Drake as well.

One of the things I liked about Danger Man is how the character is almost like a real intelligence agent. The guy doesn't drive up to a casino in a porsche using his real name, or carries with him a ton of gadgets and weapons guaranteed to finger him if searched. Drake drives around London in an Austin Cooper, only carries a weapon when necessary and uses his brain more often than gadgets to get the job done.",1198800000,,795,4.520833333333333
1900592,5,B0000A14WG,"I recently bought this Mega Set, hoping that it would be as good as I remembered it to be.  Sometimes when you look at shows years later, somehow they are not quite as good.  Once I started watching Secret Agent Man, I found I was just as enthralled with the show as I was before. I would highly recommend this Mega set.",1162771200,4,320,4.145161290322581
1900593,4,B0000A14WG,"I just bought the megaset, after having rented several of the Dangerman discs in the past. The show is top notch, my cup of tea, one of my favorite actors and shows, 5 Amazon stars all the way. I grew up on the Prisoner first as a very young lad on CBS (I really remember ROVER as a 4 year old!) and than as a teen watching every episode as it aired weekly on the local PBS, finally I bought that A&E set about 5 or so years ago and watched it with my family. Well the show is first rate, better than the 30 minute first season which I also have.

The packaging though from A&E is only 3 stars in my opinion. First, its big and bulky. This is because A&E sold mini sets of this show and didn't repackage it for the megaset, I believe that they are selling the size since its a substantial price, but for those of us who are buying TV shows in quantity, this is a disadvantage for shelf space. Second, The episodes are in the American airing order. I was watching disc 1 episode 1 in the set and after I watched it I went to an episode guide online and that is actually the 8th episode to be aired in the UK. I strongly suggest you watch this in the UK (original) air order as a lot of elements are brought out to set up the show that are not explained as well when you start on the 8th episode.

The first episode originaly shown ever was Yesterdays Enemies, I think it may be the best episode I have seen of this show (after watching 20 or so episodes). We meet Drake's boss the Admiral (great hard nose character), we also see Drake go to Lebanon and get rebuffed by the British Embassy when he asks for help, these are elements that define the show and need to be explained early on, like in the FIRST EPISODE! Later in that first episode we see Drake  question his superiors motives, I had watched this episode before but I had no idea it was the first one aired and it's very important to set up the rest of the series. Who is Drake, who is he working for, what are his and his agencies limitations? Start at this episode and not The Battle Of The Camera's (which is only an average episode, I think it was shown first in America because it has a ""gaget"", a machine gun killing in the intro, and doesn't raise Drake's questioning his superiors like Yesterdays Enemies did). I guess after watching Yesterdays Enemies it won't matter so much what order they are in but I am sticking to the UK air date schedule.

I just finished the first 3 episodes Yesterdays Enemies, The Professionals, and Colony Three. I think those three are the high water mark of the show, all top notch. To see those three which were in the original order you have to watch 3 different DVD's, so definetly 3 stars for the packaging. Other critism's, no closed captioning, and the sound level is low, I'm not looking for Dolby Digital here but I had to turn my systems volume up higher than normal (pretty high). The print quality was average, I saw some print errors on the video which is a shame. I looked on UK web sights and surprisingly they are not selling a complete Dangerman set, so America is ahead when it comes to this show.

A couple of last comments. The Prisoner was a major show in my life, if you are a Prisoner fan also see Colony Three! Watching the episode Colony Three (The third episode that aired) brought chills up my back, if this was a movie where we didn't know if Drake would survive, I would rank it up with The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, maybe better. The Colony is also very similiar to ""The Village"" from Prisoner fame. Not to give too much away but the grief he gets from his boss the Admiral at the end is a wonderful touch of great writing.

Despite my comments on the packaging, I'm very happy I finally got this set, the show is great and even watching episodes I've seen before is still very entertaining because I missed a lot in prior viewings.  Here is the order I will be viewing these in case you want to see them in UK order as well (from epguides-dangerman page):

1900594,5,B0000A14WG,"Known in the States as Secret Agent Man, Danger Man - with just a few misfire episodes, is for me, the best television in history. Better at what it does than what Seinfeld did for its genre, better even, than the BBC's The Office. 'The Best.' The stonking, pound-for-pound champion of television. Better still, than its successor, The Prisoner.

Despite what has dated, what is stunning about Danger Man is what has not. In a sense, it's sickeningly depressing, because the plot concerns are eerily of the moment. Right wing takeovers, identity theft, internment camps, Geneva and Rome endings for unlucky agents ... and a majority of episodes concerning the Middle East, which- either through huge coincidence or prescience, relate to Iraq, Israel and Lebanon! There is even a slightly anti-Israeli cautionary tale - how likely is that, today or any day? (No turncoat is John Drake; there is a touching episode or three when Drake doesn't cut any slack to those who have sold out their country, whatever their sad stories.)

Despite rumors, Patrick McGoohan was apparently never in British Intelligence. A little boxing, stage acting and chicken farming, yes; spying, no. McGoohan certainly fits the perception of the professional spy: Incredibly handsome, tall, and tough - but separate that image - also, humane, free of racial prejudiced and pro-women. Drake uses brain and brawn- he throws a good right hander, for example, though his pathetically slow running, is thankfully, kept to a minimum. (For a real laugh, dig Sean Connery running in You Only Live Twice. These spy cats ain't sprinters.)

As has been noted countless times, it's rather remarkable, that the program's standard of writing -in an average episode, as high as a good film - was maintained, week in, week out. Rare duff episodes aside, Danger Man is that rare show with consistently great and novel writing. Many episodes demand repeated viewing.

The Danger man formula included fine photography. There are exotic exteriors - McGoohan who incidentally, co-wrote several of the better episodes, let his camera people fly around the world and film whatever they liked. The interiors were filmed - I believe at Shepperton and with a few conspicuous exceptions, (some 'beaches' set in the Caribbean are dire) the interiors are HIGHLY convincing. Thus, the exterior shots of the Alps are followed by cuts to Switzerland- at- Shepperton, if you will; just marvelous; though the lighting of course, never matched.

In most episodes, Drake meets his masters for assignments in a variety of London locales. Brilliant. Are our own security services this smart? The wonderful harpsichord tune, an inevitable shot of a jet plane landing God knows where and we know: 'Here comes Drake, the brainy detective to once again, prevail with his wits - with a little help from dem fists!'

The foresight is creepy. McGoohan, who must be a peacenik, seems, from almost 40 years ago, to warn us across the chasm of time, of the dangers of a society under constant surveillance, plagued by right-wing lunatics, both harassed and sold out. A society with an uncertain future. Using his masterful Shakespearian voice (he was voted tops on the stage in 60') a fairly good range and some specialties - drunks are particularly good; McGoohan and company are very formulaic per 1960's norm - but what a wonderful brew they've concocted.

The guest stars are, almost without exception, excellent and diverse. So good that when a well-known British character actor is doing the world's worst Scottish accent; somehow, the plot flows on. The terrible attempts at a burr are in fact, an unadvertised, campy bonus. Surprises abound from a talented cast of stars - in many cases, easily eclipsing the performances of name actors from the big screen.

In the final analysis, it is Drake, Pat McGoohan and the writers, himself included, which make this the best show in the short history of TV. Patriot and lover of Britain to the end, handy man with gadgets, hater of guns and promiscuous sex, these are part of the appeal. But it is the palpable sense of doubled standards worrying Drake that is the real star shower: 'How bad is the East,' and, 'Does the murder' (yes, murder) 'that our side gets up to ... is it justified in a war on, among other things, terror and is the price sustainable?'

The best episode is a pure fantasy rather than a espionage or political thriller. It is a tale of identity theft involving perfect plastic surgery - impossible in 1964, yet today's news. That episode, 'Slay It With Flowers,' with its dazzling guest stars - foremost, young Rachel Herbert with a stellar turn as the innkeeper's daughter, is probably the best that television will ever be A plot torn from today's headlines ... fine acting, palpable danger, and above all John Drake's creed that people who don't deserve to get hurt, do.

But not if he can help it. And help he does.

Dangerman is here!",1143504000,16,4939,4.931407942238267

Some episodes involve rescuing fellow agents from the East, some from Latin

1900596,5,B0000A14WG,"I watched these shows on Saturday afternoons in the late 60s when I was a smug and angry adolescent. My dad, with whom I had very little in common otherwise, and I would come in from yard work, get a cool drink, and enjoy the smart and stylish show together. They were absorbing; for years I wondered why so little television could match the excellence of these. And though I have never seen them since, they, and the brilliant harpsichord theme song, remain etched in my mind.

So, nearly 40 years later, I bought them as a gift for my dad, now that we have more in common. And heard him, much to my surprise, complain.

Not because of the content. No, we watched the first three episodes last night, two wonderful, one not-so-good (wish they'd kept ALL American actresses away.) Suave, witty, well-photographed, and plotted expertly. No, he could not decipher what was being said. In the shows we watched, we had French, Romanian, and German accents, and his hearing has deteriorated to where he could not understand the dialogue. AND SUBTITLES ARE NOT AVAILABLE! (nor is much else in the DVD menu--nothing extra at all.....)

I would think a goodly chunk of their potential audience is my dad's age and has my dad's ears. Why oh why, on a set this expensive, did they not include the option of captions?

So, if the intended viewers of this show have any hearing loss, be warned. These will be incomprehensible.",1120348800,30,1414,4.644

The video quality, for DVD, is quite good. Audio quality is generally quite good but occasionally seems a bit low. There are *NO* subtitles. This is most puzzling as it neglects a large portion of society would greatly benefit from its inclusion. Subtitles in multiple languages could greatly expand the audience for this series. Perhaps the next inevitable release could add subtitles greatly enhancing the series appeal. Also, there are *no* extras. None. Zip. Nada.

Although the image quality is quite good, a remaster from the original 35mm film to Blu-ray is *way* overdue.

7995239,5,B0000A14WG,"It was in a time often called the golden age of television. Most shows were still in B&W and color television was still new. This was when I saw ""Secret Agent."" I was quite young and loved it. It made an impression that has lasted. When Secret Agent was on TV back then, I was there to watch to hear the Johnny Rivers theme song starting: ""There's a man who lives a life of danger...""

After many years I was thrilled when I found this set of the entire series. When I watched it I was not disappointed. I was surprised how very well it held up over time.

I like that Patrick McGoohan's John Drake character used his mind and strategy more than guns and violence. Yes, the occasional fight and gunshot, but more the exception than the rule. Clever disguise and misdirection gave simple solutions to difficult situations. It was a time when smart and clever was favored over violence and explosions.

When thinking about the technical quality of the video I think it's important to allow for when it was made. By today's high definition and digital world it will seem crude. I take those artifacts as a reminder of that time; as part of the context needed to appreciate the series.

Earlier shows (the Danger Man episodes) are for 30m airing but the later (Secret Agent) ones were for 1h airing (if commercials were included). The last two episodes are in color which was both delightful and makes those two seem a little jarring after watching the rest in B&W.

A lot of television from the 60's didn't really hold up that well. But the shows that did are worthwhile. Like Secret Agent they have an emphasis on story and character. I'm really glad I came across the Secret Agent series on DVD and I feel it deserves 5 Stars.",1418601600,,1725,4.480891719745223

7995241,5,B0000A14WG,"If you've never watched the ""Spy TV"" of the 60s you are in for a treat. Two of the more serious endeavors in the television realm was the American based 'I Spy' series, starring the inimitable Bill Cosby and the show's co-creator Robert Culp, and the British based 'Danger Man' series (known as 'Secret Agent' in America) starring the enigmatic Patrick McGoohan. Spinoffs such as The Avengers, Get Smart, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and The Saint were a bit more tongue-in-cheek entrees to say the least. Mission Impossible was a serious drama but not quite in the same vein as I Spy and Danger Man. These two shows were true contemporaries (although the temporal overlap was minor), and comparing I Spy to Danger Man helps ferret out the strengths of both shows. Each series is well worth viewing.

To set a context, Danger Man came out in 1960. It was pre-James Bond, pre-I Spy, and pre-most anything else in the genre. Danger Man, which began life as a  hour production and later morphed into a 1 hour show in 1964, launched the first of the solo, lone wolf-esk, righter-of-wrong characters with that all important ultra-cool substrate. 6'2"" consummate actor Patrick McGoohan IS secret agent John Drake. Just as Peter Falk fully embodied 'Columbo' (a show that received both McGoohan and Culp as guest stars) it is impossible to imagine anyone other than McGoohan in the John Drake role. As with I Spy's Kelly Robinson & Alexander Scott, Danger Man's Drake traveled the world, engaging in high intrigue across other lands and within other cultures.

And it is the traveling element that let's us draw our first distinction between I Spy and Danger Man. I Spy was shot on location! With few exceptions, Danger Man was shot in the studio, with stock footage of other countries cleverly blended in. But I Spy was truly shot on location. They actually took the crew to Italy, to Greece, to Spain and to Asia. When you're watching I Spy you are getting a glimpse of what it looked like around the world in the 60s. In my view this is one of the best reasons to go through the series. It is 'boots on the ground' realism as we follow Robinson and Scott on their world-wide adventures.

Having said that, I have to be quite frank and point out that I Spy does not hold up as well as Danger Man. Danger Man (both the  hr and 1 hr versions) had very tight scripts, thanks in large part to the constant involvement of the show's creator (and writing contributor) Ralph Smart, as well as strong input from McGoohan. This may be hard to believe but I don't think I've ever seen a bad Danger Man. I Spy on the other hand sprouted a few stinker episodes. There is one reason for this; weak writing. Robert Culp actually discusses the show's writing in the commentary track he recorded for several episodes. The concept of I Spy was great, with Culp and Cosby adeptly pulling off the playful banter that was the substrate of the show. But the thing was, the writers often didn't get it. They often wrote *under* the show (scripts were often loose and full of plot holes) as opposed writing to what Culp/Cosby were capable of executing. If you are a ""cross the Ts and dot the I's"" kind of viewer some of the I Spy episodes are nearly unwatchable.

However, the chemistry of Culp and Cosby, the locations shooting with its voyeuristic look at the 60s is without compare. I don't think I'd buy the whole series, but there are some great episodes (with specific recommendations from other reviewers). Conversely, I do have the entire Danger Man series. If you check it out don't overlook the earlier  hr series. It is surprisingly well done. They somehow managed to contain an integral story arc in that 28 or so minutes. The intro of this first series also has a very Bond-like McGoohan introducing himself as ""Drake .... John Drake"". This, two years before Sean Connery introduced himself as Bond ... James Bond in Dr. No!

The last contrasting feature I can think to bring up is the use of firearms. Patrick McGoohan, who was a very moral man and had a heavy influence on the John Drake character, rarely used a gun. He wanted a family show, with minimal violence and sex. Drake was all about brains over brawn, and thanks to great writing the gun element is not missed. Scott and Robinson are more conventional spys and are rarely caught not packing. The pair are somewhat discreet with their use of unnecessary gun play however, so I would say this difference in the shows is less about any I Spy violence and more about the extra work required by the Danger Man writing staff to get Drake out of a jam without the quick and easy plot device afforded by a gun.

Music-wise I Spy and Danger Man are on similar footing, with memorable scores for both series. The 1960-62  hr Danger Man has a punchy, jazzy theme, with an even punchier theme accompanying the 1964-66 1 hr version (sold in the USA as Secret Agent, with the unforgettable Johnny Rivers theme). I absolutely love the I Spy theme as well, which rests nicely on the opening visuals where Kelly Robinson, in the blink of an eye transforms from a racket swinging tennis bum to an armed spy, taking the shot, and disappearing through the doorway formed by the upper case ""I"" in the title. So, a total of four themes... all of them winners (as is true of so many 60s TV shows).

ps - Given the claim made about Danger Man being one of the first spy dramas with a super cool agent, it should be noted that a production of Ian Fleming's 'Casino Royale' was aired in the 1950s on live TV in America. You can find this short but excellent production included in the extras on the DVD for the 1967 parody version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B00005JL0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;starring Peter Sellers. In another interesting parallel between John Drake and James Bond, the Bond in this 50's production is an AMERICAN working for the CIA. Likewise the early Danger Man series had John Drake also portrayed as an American, albeit working for NATO. All subsequent Drake/Bond characters were of course British.",1404864000,2,6133,4.711753731343284
7995242,5,B0000A14WG,"Mind you, it's not as good as McGoohan's ""The Prisoner,"" but watching these early BBC shows is a good primer for watching the later series, as John Drake's growing disaffection for his agency becomes clearer as the series progresses, making The Prisoner a logical follow-up.",1402012800,2,274,5.111111111111111
7995243,5,B0000A14WG,"Stephen King tells readers of The Shining that Danny Torrance and his dad never miss an episode of Secret Agent/Danger Man. When the family moves to the Overlook Hotel and apparitions start to scare Danny, he tells himself, ""Be like the Secret Agent Man. Would Patrick McGoohan be crying and peeing in his pants?""
With this collection of Secret Agent episodes, I realize the attraction is Patrick McGoohan's character, John Drake (""That's Drake, John Drake.""), ability to teach little boys how to be men. He is cool, there is little doubt about it; but the world he inhabits is complex and amoral, and he has to preserve a little personal space, even when he socializes with the people in that amoral world. He has to be amenable and charming, even while he suspects everyone.
The plots are not merely believable, they have a cutting-edge originality:
1) In Italy, he searches for the leader of a team of hired killers. Along the way, he meets a pretty South American. Although he is attracted to her, he also suspects she is part of that team.
2) In Iraq, he has to find a Russian agent in his own nation's embassy. A British general in London thinks he knows who the double agent is and sends his own team of killers to Iraq to take him out. Drake has to find the double agent before the team of killers does. It is a fairly mature study of departmental rivalry that plagues every government.
3) In Africa, Drake has to protect a young nation's prime minister from members of his own government who want to forge ties with China, against the prime minister's own intentions.
4) In Haiti, Drake has to rescue a British couple who are nuclear scientists from another British couple who are working for the Soviets.
5) On the French Riviera, Drake photographs a pretty French information-trafficker, even while her co-workers photograph him.
The stories make frequent use of the changing terms of the British Empire and the new countries of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. There is much hard-ass humor about the state of the world. It is simply as good a television series as I have seen.",1350432000,3,2090,4.666666666666667
