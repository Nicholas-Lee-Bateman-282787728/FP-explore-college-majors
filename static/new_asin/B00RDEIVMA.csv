6928687,3,B00RDEIVMA,"I saw the trailer which lets haunted genre movie enthusiasts know this is a stinker...but when I saw the balcony and stairs are exactly what I wanted on the back of my house I bought it so I could show it to a contractor!  This is the only reason I am pleased with my purchase!

This suffering film wants to be good and it could be good handled properly.  This is a great story poorly told.

SO MANY FRUSTRATING DETAILS IN THIS FILM, I am unable to describe them all, but here is a small sampling for smart people bored enough to read this review:

Who gets to spend the night in a house they have not signed papers for?
What five months pregnant woman who can afford a two million dollar home sleeps on the floor even one night without hiring cleaners and movers?
We hate our bad real estate agents, but there is a law about disclosing murders and suicides and any death in the home before selling.  She could have sued the agency before she suffered foreclosure.
Please list what the old lady eats, she was born in 1906...she is over 100 years old and getting around like a healthy 80 year old.  Does she buy her vitamins on Amazon?

I did watch the entire film hoping something scary would happen.  It just kept missing.  The characters were so unlikable it did not feel like a loss when they died.  I dislike slasher films and yet was hoping the writers, producers and directors would be eviscerated during the end credits.  Alas, the only torture in the film is the viewer watching this film and perhaps those reading this review.",1427587200,2,1535,4.404255319148936

6928689,3,B00RDEIVMA,"The story starts in 1920 with the formation of a nice looking hand made Ouija board. It then jumps to the present for a quick scene and then two years later which I understood to mean ""present"" also. Michelle (Megan Ward) is an atheist who writes children books with witches and dragons. Her husband Jack (Victor Browne) is an out of work actor and Christian. They argue a bit over their expected child's baptism as they move into their new home.

Now to no surprise, Michelle discovers said board in the attic. Jack wants her to toss it out, recalling a bad experience he and his Marine buddies had with one during Desert Storm. I tried to picture that scene and had to laugh, even if Michelle didn't. Anyway Michelle uses the board (the type that only needs one person) with a cast iron pointer (see top of DVD cover) and things begin to happen quite rapidly.

When I saw the names ""Lou Diamond Phillips"" and ""Pam Grier"" I was thinking a 1 star cheese comedy, something that is normally reserved for Eric Roberts or Christian Slater. Pam had a minor role as ""Zelda"" a medium, apparently a tribute to Zelda Rubenstein (""Poltergeist""). Pam did a decent job, although I didn't know psychics needed to be invited into a home. I thought that was just vampires. LDP had a support role as the investigating officer and he was Jack's commander.  They really didn't get a chance to make me laugh and hold my nose that much.

Now the first killing you can see coming from miles away. The anticipation, the foreboding music, and the timing made for a good scene. The film had its up and down moments for the first 2/3 of the film and I was enjoying it. Then the movie fell out of the window and off a cliff. The ending was like it had a faith based film writer come in and finish it off. Seriously, this is how you wanted to end the film?

I'm not sure what the woman in the lake on the DVD cover is about. I must have missed something. Walmart $9.96 US

6928690,5,B00RDEIVMA,"one of the best supernatural horror films I've seen.
The fear factor is there but the real genius is in the way it makes you feel fearful; more like  constant foreboding and anxiousness.

Lou Diamond Philips is wonderful as always, but everyone is good in this.
The pace and tension are perfectly timed and never skips a beat.
Nothing cheesy about the approach; there's a strong psychological vein that runs through this script and directing.",1426982400,,442,4.88

6928692,2,B00RDEIVMA,"The Invited, I admit, drew me in with the pretty cool, eye-catching DVD artwork. Then I watched the trailer, and - knowing nothing about this movie - then saw I was in for what was probably going to end up being the usual b-horror movie experience. So, being a fan of horror, I decided to take the equally usual leap of faith and hope for the best. At $4.99, it wasn't an inexpensive choice, but hey, you never know when you'll find that diamond in the rough, so I rented it. With that super boring backstory behind us, let's continue...

This is indeed a b-horror movie, first off, and not destined for theaters. In my experience, 75% of these turn out to be pretty disappointing, or outright disastrous. The Invited, I have to say, this is a great example of a perfectly average b-movie, but still nothing more than the usual kind of horror-thriller fare you might find on one of the cable networks (it's actually a lot like the line of horror films put out, oddly enough, by the Lifetime Channel). It's predictable, unoriginal, and without scares, chills. In fact, barely anything (other than a few spooky sounds, and the appearance of the most interesting element of the movie: the spirit board) qualifies it to be in the horror genre. Thriller? Maybe. Horror? No.

The Invited tells the story of a kind of low-end JK Rowling and her husband who are on a budget and are looking for a new home and come across a suprisingly cheap, but amazingly beautiful home. Who could resist? Little do they know, it is...

...take a guess: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

Yes: haunted. And while there's a pretty cool looking Ouija (spirit) board, there's nothing about this movie or, alas, even the board, that's worth the rental price. You can see everything coming, plot-wise, from a mile away, and it's largely without gore (though there's a splash of blood from time to time), and no T&A for those who like that with their horror. It's truly just a bland story with a bland presentation; again, like sometime the Lifetime Channel would put out: safe, tame, boring b-movie ""horror.""

Positives: this b-movie did have a budget, if a low budget, and the overall quality of the film itself is quite good - good camerawork, good HD, even good sets, costume, and some decent acting.

For me, it was definitely not worth the $5.

SO, bottom line: unless you like you horror safe and unscary (and I know some people do): wait for it on Amazon Prime or Netflix.",1426896000,4,2431,4.549199084668192

6928695,4,B00RDEIVMA,"Starts off on March 3 1920 with a girl named Natalie who's mother died, after the funeral pining Natalie wants to talk to her mom one last time and makes a Quija board a unique one at that. She takes the board and head to the grave yard to use it however and gets a response she sees mom but it turns horrific. The Quija board is not just a normal spirit board it is a demonic door for demons and the forces of hell that come to collect their due after being used

Years later in more modern times a nice looking young couple owns and is living in the house, the husband who looks like one of those really cool rock band dudes is awoken and heads to the bathroom to shave and ends up getting a rather nasty surprise. Later there is tragedy death and misery in the home

2 Years later another young couple Jack and Michelle buy the house and all is going well, the husband sees the Quija/hell board and tells her to get rid of it and how he had a really bad experience with one in the past. She takes the board to dispose of it but then little miss curiosity decides to mess with it opening the way once again for demonic forces. Gradually things change for the worse

As things worsen in epic proportions like the beyond belief shockingly horrible event that takes place with the poor real estate lady. A psychic Pam Grier is called in to gain some insight as to what's going on and she sees the past horrors that took place throughout the years. Lou Diamond Philips plays her dead husband Jack's friend who is trying to help Michelle, he calls a friend to run a check on Natalie the girl who lived in the house in 1920. After he finds out that Natalie is still alive and living in a nursing home he goes to see her. Natalie wants to help and comes to the house to deal with the board

SPOILER ALERT................MAJOR SPOILER ALERT BELOW...................SPOILER ALERT

The ending is stupid and sucks ?

Michelle's husband dies while driving immediately right after her messing with the Quija board, She loses their unborn child.. While Natalie  prepares to do a cleansing on the board and tells the others not to come in until her or Michelle open the door. Inside during the cleansing Natalie is sucked into a portal like thing and disappears. Michelle is also pulled into a strange place. She sees Jack who's wearing white and is in a bright white light and wants to go with him he tells her she cannot and that she has a life to live and disappears

Jack suddenly reappears wearing a blue shirt and telling her that there is a way they can be together she asks how and tells her all she has to do is give him her soul. Hello ding, ding, ding the warning bell should ring that is a demon talking regular dead folks or people from heaven do not ask for such things. A gun appears and you guessed it she blows her brains out

She finds herself back with Jack and carrying the child she'd previously lost, while in the car driving they narrowly escape a car crash, Jack stops and gets out to replace the damaged tire, Michelle sees the car jack starting to slip and warns him Jack' jumps back in the nick of time. These life ending mishaps eliminated she smiles however she is hit by a car her head gets lopped off while on the ground the head sees the wheel of another car coming toward it splat the end. What irks me so bad is that after all the fighting to survive and escape the evil it ends like that",1432252800,3,3409,4.281055900621118

6928700,3,B00RDEIVMA,"Warning: possible spoilers--although the term is used lightly in this case.

The Invited is kind of a hard to review--it's definitely not a good movie in any possible sense or the word--the acting is frequently terrible and the story incoherent at best--but co-writer/director Ryan McKinney seems eager to throw in pretty much anything he can think of to generate some cheap thrills or unexpected laughs.  The Invited is an evil Ouija board movie and a haunted house movie and the devil himself makes a personal appearance eventually.

The story involves a young couple who get a beautiful old house really, really cheap--but it never occurs to them to do a Google search before buying to see if there might be a reason why.  What happened to the previous inhabitants wasn't pretty--a young couple lived in the house and the woman sliced her husband's throat with a straight razor and then killed herself because of the evil Ouija board--and frequently if things in The Invited threaten to get too slow Natalie the very pregnant new owner will see gory visions of the previous tenants that pop up conveniently to make her scream in terror and then disappear.

Natalie loses her husband to a terrible car wreck about 30 seconds after asking the evil Ouija board her very first question but she never makes any connection between the board and her husband's violent death.  Then after Natalie confronts her realtor (again without bothering to do a Google search first) the chastised older woman confesses that maybe she didn't tell the young couple everything about the house.  She drives back there with Natalie to try and make amends but gets taken out by an Evil Dead style special effect that seems to come completely out of nowhere but is admittedly sorta cool.

Pam Grier turns up to chew the scenery for a few minutes as a psychic investigator named Zelda--probably a reference to Zelda Rubinstein, the actress who played the pint-sized paranormal expert in The Poltergeist.  Grier is fun and giving here more to do wouldn't have been a bad idea but the filmmakers likely only had enough money to pay her for one day of shooting.

What follows are a cluster of scenes that frequently make little sense--Natalie sexually propositions Garrett (Lou Diamond Philips), her husband's old war buddy who is also the homicide detective investigating the death of the realtor, he makes the chivalrous decision to sleep on the couch but regrets that later when a violent paranormal experience throws Natalie out of the bedroom window and she loses her baby, then Natalie's medical insurance is suddenly canceled and a foreclosure notice is posted on the front door of the house but Natalie comes up with money in the nick of time by remembering that the dead realtor lady gave her the business card of an antiques dealer who wanted to buy all the furniture in the house, then Garrett tracks down the woman who originally made the Ouija board when she was a young teen in 1902 (which would make her really, really old) then The Invited pilfers from (in quick succession) Poltergeist, What Dreams May Come and The Last Temptation of Christ--but because director Ryan McKinney apparently wanted his movie to go out with a bang after all that things really get crazy.

The Invited isn't a good movie and by the end I couldn't tell if it was intentionally tongue-in-cheek or just really bad--maybe a little of both but when the end credits come up remembering that The Invited opened with the words ""Inspired by a true story"" will likely bring a smile to the face of even the most jaded viewer.  While there is absolutely no way I could recommend The Invited there are much worse ways to waste an hour and a half--and I was likely a lot more entertained by this thing than I should have been.",1428883200,2,3781,4.782208588957055

I will always buy anything that Lou Diamond Phillips is in, every time. The Lou is one of my all time favorite actors so when this came out I was very excited. This was one of those movies that that my brother and I watched with my Grandparents. They are fans of his as well and especially in a horror movie. This is one of those haunted house type flicks involving a Ouija board.

A married couple buy a house for two million dollars as one is a actor [the husband] and one is a writer [the wife] . It is their dream house and wife a child on the way it is the perfect time for such a purchase. But something is in the house, a Ouija board that the wife finds and accidently spills her blood on from a small cut. It turns out that there is a long, bad history with the house. Now the relater did mention that the former owner did pass away in the house but didn't mention it was a murder/suicide. After she finds it and decides to play with it since she doesnt believe in any of that stuff things go horribly wrong for her and her family.

The story is an interesting one from writers Regan and Ryan McKinney [who also directed] but things start to get crazy. I am of course talking about that ending that kinda leaves you wondering what really happened, maybe that was the point. But other than that I enjoyed it especially seeing The Lou and Pam Grier in the same film, and scenes. Of course Pam Grier has a much smaller part but she is always entertaining. Acting wise all were good here and the film was shot very well.

Like I said I did enjoy this movie but it just seems like something was missing. Speaking of missing it was really disappointing that the DVD did not come with a commentary from the writers or actors or both. A making of would have been really welcomed here as well. Still over all it was good.",1437523200,2,1833,4.18413597733711
