571564,5,6303101178,"The Original mini-series was undoubtedly Kenneth (Incredible Hulk, Bionic Man/Woman) Johnson's greatest achievement in television.  It is a spectacular and frightening ""What If?"" epic about the arrival of the Visitors from a dying planet in the Sirius system who have come to our world for Earth's abundance of resources in exchange for cures to diseases and ""all the fruits of their knowledge"".  Intrepid photojournalist Mike Donovan (The Beastmaster) is suspicious of the Visitor's intentions and hijacks a shuttle to the mothership, only to discover the Visitor's horrific truth and their plans for the people of Earth.  When Mike convinces a group of other skeptics organized by the beautiful and resilient Dr. Juliet Parrish (Faye Grant) the Resistance of freedom fighters in born and begin terrorizing the occupying Visitors.  The Government and the Visitors agree to impose marshall law to combat the Resistance and what ensues can only be compared to the Nazi halocaust.  However, Donovan makes an alliance with a Visitor sympathizer named Martin (Frank Ashmore) and members of the Visitor Fifth Column who ally themselves with the humans in the battle to save Earth.  A solid cast with outstanding performances from the aforementioned including the unforgettable treachery of Jane Badler as the Visitor leader Diana who gives new meaning to the word Snake.  Diana is one villain who could give even Darth Vader a run for his money.  V is the inpiration for many imitations such as Alien Nation and Independence Day... none of which could compare to the dramatic suspense of this classic mini-series.  Accept no substitutes!  V: The Final Battle was the sequel mini-series, and while it was entertaining and introduced fan-fave Michael Ironside as the stone-cold merc Ham Tyler, it failed to hold on to the dramatic suspense presented in the Original mini-series.  A short-lived weekly television followed after and was a pale resemblance to either dramatic mini-series.",988675200,10,1978,5.3076923076923075
571565,4,6303101178,"The original ""V"" mini-series was some of the best television science fiction in the eighties.  It can be looked at as low budget by today's CGI special effects standards, but the story more than makes up for any failings.  The first two nights of the mini-series was superb television... an allegory to the beginning of the Jewish Holocaust and Nazism if you can believe it!  The insidious way in which the mysterious alien ""visitors"" slowly take over the planet POLITICALLY, rather than by using force, could be seen by some as a television weakness (there are not much in the way of special effects); but I consider it to be the story's strength.  It forced the creators of the series to focus on plot, character, and mood (what a concept!), which results in a slowly building sense of horror as the true plans of the visitors are revealed.  Give this series a shot, you won't regret it!  ...  ""V - The Final Battle"", the third thru fifth nights of the mini-series (actually aired months later) was also effective, though more action oriented, and details the growing human rebellion against the visitors.  The climax to the storyline wraps things up very nicely.  ...  A warning: DO NOT waste your time watching any of the hour-long episodes of the short lived follow-up weekly series.  Incredibly bad science fiction and a waste of a good concept, these 18 episodes or so gave the concept of ""V"" a bad name.",987206400,13,1411,4.695121951219512
571566,5,6303101178,"V is for victory.  This is my favorite mini-series ever.  Independence Day borrows heavily from this 1980's show (and borrows poorly, I might add).  As a faction of the public finds out the aliens are not our friends, but here for othe purposes.  But there are a lot of good performances here, and the story line never lets up.  Even Michael Ironside shows up.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone.",987120000,3,399,4.549295774647887
571567,5,6303101178,"When this miniseries came out in 1983, I was not into sci-fi at all, but I always had vague memories about this show. Just a few years after the show  came and went, I became a big fan of sci-fi. Go figure. Anyway, I picked  this up a couple of years ago and I was thoroughly impressed! The story is  great (a sort of modern day holocaust, with the aliens as the fascist  leaders) and the special effects are very solid after all these years. You  will love the characters and how they all relate and react to each other.  The only weak point is Marc Singer's corny acting, but that is easily  overlooked as he is a pretty cool guy. The main plot is very good and the  ending leaves you wanting more. I've always seen the value in sci-fi movies  that rely on storytelling instead of being special-effects-laden yawners,  The Day The Earth Stood Still, for example, and this is one of the best. It  is one of the coolest movies I own and is highly recommended for sci-fi  fans and also anyone who likes a good story.",966384000,4,1015,4.28421052631579
571568,5,6303101178,"I remember seeing V for the first time in the summer of '83. I was all of 8 years old, and I loved it. 17 years later, I love it all the more. What V is is a masterful retelling of the Nazi occupation in Europe. The facist  overtones were intentional, as shown by the brown uniforms for the Friends  of the Visitors (a youth group that gets explained in the series), and the  fact that the Visitor logo looks just a *little* too much like a swastika  for comfort. This series spawned V: The Final Battle (a superb sequel), as  well as a TV series that unfortunately didn't last too long. And if *that*  were available on video I'd pick it up too.
Flaws? Well, the SFX were  great for the time, but after seeing the Matrix, well, they're kinda weak  by today's standards. I pay attention to the background music, and in the  first one, it could have used some serious work. It fits, but it still kind  of grates after a while.

571569,5,6303101178,"Every since I can remember, I've been watching V every so often, probably for about 15 years, around when it came out on tv.  I've read some not-so-great reviews, but I think those people really just haven't sensed  the whole meaning behind the movie.  With so many ties to the Holocaust (a  whole population being convinced that ""scientists are the enemy""  i.e. scapegoating, the police being on the side of the visitors, people  going into hiding, not enough hiding places, and a general acceptance of  the visitors), to resistance fighting which displayed unselfish heroism and  this part reminds me of protests during the Vietnam War, and parallelism to  the Cold War (two major superpowers, Earth and the visitors, fighting for  world power), this movie holds so many important themes that no other movie  has ever displayed at once.  I give it a definite five stars, always hoping  there will be some kind of sequel.",935712000,5,922,4.909090909090909

571707,5,6303101178,"Still relevant 35 years later, maybe even more so. I won't go into the story details as many other reviewers have done this far better than I could. Yes there are some things in the dialog that are very of it's time, yes there are plot holes, but it's still a great story, it's a warning against the mob mentality, the court of public opinion, and how easily we can be manipulated en masse. It is a message to see the world for yourself and act.",1520121600,,445,4.186046511627907
571708,2,6303101178,"I remembered it was better than it is. But certainly ahead of its time for content when it came out. Pretty cheesy acting, poor quality special effects. And of course, the Holocaust remembrance story had to be inserted into the story line somehow. So not necessary. I guess if it was get approval for production from the group that runs Hollywood, Johnson had to write that in. I wonder, who first exposed the lizard aliens? Where did Johnson get this in the 1980's?  Also very interesting, was that Johnson dedicated the series to ""the past, present, and future resistance movements.""",1518307200,,585,4.85

571827,5,6303101178,"V:The Original TV Mini-series is the first story that was aired in 1980's. Marc Singer, Faye Grant, Jane Badler, Richard Herd and Frank Ashmore bring the battle to your home. The points and story are well written and this is still as heart pounding as it was when it first aired on TV. This is Robert Englund's best performance before he turned to the dark side of films in the Freddy Krueger characters. This ends the beginning of the mini-series and the next chapters are in V: The Final Battle. The V:The Complete Series is the weekly tv show as the continuation of the 3rd part of the story.

571831,4,6303101178,"I was just a kid when ""V"" hit the airwaves in 1983. I was far too young to appreciate it back then. I finally decided to buy the DVD and give it a proper viewing now, as an adult. I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's not perfect, and parts of it haven't necessarily aged well, but you have to keep in mind the era in which it was made. The writing might not be as sophisticated (or subtle) as some of today's more polished TV shows, but ""V"" was competing with the likes of Battlestar Galactica (1978) and Buck Rogers (1979). By comparison, ""V"" is vastly superior (in terms of action, adventure and intellect). It's like combining the intelligence of Star Trek with the fun and excitement of Star Wars. I highly recommend it, along with the sequel miniseries ""V: The Final Battle.""",1505692800,,774,4.381944444444445

572022,4,6303101178,"I know, I know, I know, this movie is campy, it's cheesy, it's even silly at times, right?  However, having said that, let's consider some things about ""V"" that may change your minds.  This show first aired in 1983 as a two-part television miniseries which was advertised as must see T.V.  It  didn't disappoint!  I watched it with my wife and we were glued to the tube for two nights.  We thoroughly enjoyed it!  Viewed today, I'm sure that there will be those who criticize the special effects, and other aspects, but remember this was 1983; 34 years ago!  But, the storyline is very relevant even today.  Perhaps, even more relevant today considering the numerous U.F.O. scenarios and subsequent reports generated world wide in newspapers and television programs.  Not to mention, our global political turmoil and dangerous military saber rattling and our sobering environmental issues and health problems, all of which threaten humankind with escalating and relentless pace.  So, who knows, perhaps Alien intervention may be next on the horizon, which (thankfully) brings me back to ""V"".  The movie begins with the sudden appearance of gigantic, saucer like space craft  around the world.  Fifty of these city-sized ships arrive simultaneously and hover silently over major cities across the globe.  Eventually, contact is made by these visitors (as they come to be known) when they make a global simulcast in whatever languages necessary, announcing that they come in peace.  The astounding, yet relieving message further invites the Secretary General of the U.N. to meet with their emissary on the rooftop of the U.N. building.  The unprecedented meeting reveals to the anxious world that the galactic travelers are surprisingly humanlike in appearance, and have come seeking our aid.  We learn that their invironment is in dire straights and that their very survival depends on certain chemicals and minerals found in abundance on the earth.  In exchange for our assistance the visitors are willing to share  advanced scientific, medical and technological knowledge which would benefit humandkind tremendously.  Earth accepts their bountiful offer but it is soon revealed that our new interstellar friends are much more than they appear, and that we are getting much more (or less) than we bargained for!  For one thing, it becomes increasingly obvious that they are a militaristic/totalitarian society which through propaganda and other means, quickly insinuates itself throughout our society on a global level.  Their structure and tactics are strikingly similar to those of Nazi Germany from their singlilng out and subsequent persecution of  scientist to their establishment of Visitor Youth Groups and media campaigns.  Even their uniforms are reminiscent of Nazi uniforms right down to their ""Jackboots""!  The two night series is really a Nazi allegory portrayed in a science fiction format which I found both clever and thought provoking.  And, BY NO MEANS do I suggest that there was anything intertaining about the Holocaust!  I'm speaking relative to the premise and film style of this particular television show.  And there are further even more sinister, shocking and frightening revelations about this race discovered by prominent and suspicious photo journalist Mike Donovan (Mark Singer) who manages to sneak aboard the gigantic mothership hovering over Los Angeles.  There, Donovan manages to surreptitiously
film a few of the visitors and captures their TRUE nature in a startling scene which left me (and viewers) stunned and talking about the show around the water cooler the next few days!  But that's just the beginning as Donovan, once again on board the mothership, learns the REAL reason for the vistor's arrival in a mind bending scene  that leaves him reeling from shock, both visually and intellectually as his mind slowly absorbs what he sees and the unearthly insideous and horrifying plot becomes clear!  A plan so vile, and vast in its scope and ambition that it even surpasses what happened in Nazi Germany,  and makes abundantly clear the depth of  humankind's peril as a consequence of intering into this unholy alliance with a superior extraterrestrial race.
Our leaders have signed our death warrants and it's up to Donovan and a ragtag resistance force led by a bright young med student/biologist named Julie Parrish played by the lovely Faye Grant (who I met and teased about her diminutive stature and tiny feet while doing security at a summer theater festival in the Berkshires) to stop these interstellar fascists who have infiltrated the highest levels of global governments down to the local levels of law enforcement.  And, remember, the special effects as well as the miniseries itself, helped to inspire the blockbuster film ""Independence Day"" and many of the current Sci Fi television shows of today.  So I give ""V""  a strong recommendation and hope you enjoy it too.",1486944000,10,4922,5.2150127226463106

572498,5,6303101178,"This gem of  series came out in the early 80's but that doesn't detract from how great this show was for that time period.
It is a story about the human spirit and surviving under a terrible threat, this set is where it all starts. continues in the final battle and concluded in the series. its special effects are good for that time period and the story and acting for most part is better than the 2000's remake which could have been called anything else and would have been all right. the remake just had better effects but they lost the great story line and destroyed what the series was about. I believe they even made a Comic book series off this series, I could be wrong though.

So I highly recommend the entire series from beginning to end is worth the watching. I also recommend Alien Nation movie, Alien Nation T.V. series and Alien Nation T.V. movies",1462320000,2,861,4.443037974683544

At the time people were amazed at the good story which was a analogy of naziism or facism or even communism.  the acting was great and the effects were top notch for their time.  This was a real event and it's story holds  up very well today.  The remake was a disaster because it was so wishy washy unlike this one. The v aliens are well done too in this one.  The story rings true as far as people going along with horrible police state that is out to wipe people out.  The next year was another classic the second miniseries.  Then they did a ok tv series that was decent but after the two classic miniseries wasn't able to catch on.  This isn't remastered of course  , it's a dvd.  And I would welcome a blu ray of this and the second miniseries.  This was a part of peoples lives at the time as most people were familiar with it.  And it holds up well story wise and even special effects wise and this was before cgi effects!  ANother interesting fact is that the leader of the resistance is a woman!  That was a good and inspirational thing in 1983 United States as well.  I have this dvd and the rest but lets hope for a blu ray someday.",1426377600,,1321,4.195219123505976

573567,2,6303101178,"Idea of invaders splitting over whether they want to hurt the invaded, patterned roughly after the Twilight Zone episode, 'To Serve Man', a theme which frankly is always worth exploring.  So the idea behind the series, is a good one.  Pity, though, the script was horrid, the characters not developed, etc.  Unlike most scif-fi, this one doesn't have that edge which made shows like Blakes 7, Day of the Triffids (the series, not the movie), and of course Star Trek, perennial favorites.

I'm really glad that this series was redone in 2009, though I've not yet seen the new version.  This older one, I remember from when it first came out.  Marc Singer wrecked the show with his bad acting, but frankly the cheesy dialogue would have killed it anyway.  Despite that, some of the actors were believable.  Standouts were Michael Ironside and Robert Englund, who is quite charming without the Freddie mask.

Even so, at the time it came out, it was a new attempt at making a series more realistic;  and remember, this was the early 1980's, which still carried too much of the horrible TV filming 'culture' of the 1970's.  After all, not everyone could be as clever as Dr. Who and Star Trek.

Series had no humor;  Dr. Who is cheesy too, but the humor makes the cheese tasty.  In Part 3 of Final Battle, they tried to introduce some humor and cheesy 80's elevator music.  Again, maybe the new version is better.  If not, then wash rinse repeat, for the idea remains a good one.",1401494400,,1474,4.611538461538461

I still believe that, but now I can appreciate the plot a lot more.  Sometimes there were a few things that didn't make much sense, but all in all it was a very good movie.  You had to love the villains.  The characters were well-developed...sometimes annoyingly so, but as I'm getting older I can sympathize with more of them.  The old V had an appeal that the new one lacked.  The new series made the Visitors more animal, whereas while the Visitors of the old series were reptilian, they had enough human attributes for you to be able to identify with them.

573933,3,6303101178,"The first part of a 1983 TV show in Sci-Fi, about how 50 UFO's come to planet earth and the aliens onboard say they come in peace.  As the first shuttle lands for the alien leader to meet with our own leader from the United Nations, a high school band plays the theme from ""Star Wars"" and when the alien leader speaks, his voice echoes similar to the Goa'uld of the Stargate SG-1 series.  Of course there is a small band of resistance fighters who recognize the real mission of the aliens is to wipe out humankind, and so they begin to organize.
This DVD is a two sided disc, with part 1 and part 2, and then you'll also need to buy the sequel DVD in this same time frame for production, the concluding part of the ""V"" story is called ""V - The Final Battle"" and it came out in 1984.
Both of these are ""unrated"" because they were made for TV, and don't have ANY reason whatsoever (none) to be rated for limiting the age of young children who watch the show.  There is an attractive blonde woman in her bra and panties, and a brunette laying on a bed showing off most of her legs - but in both cases, the six o'clock news is twice as racy or risqu.
The reason I bought the DVD's is because this ended up being a ""culture"" film series, referred to in subsequent science fiction, other prime time TV shows, literature, and small talk around the water cooler where I work.  I didn't want to be left out, so I added these to my repertoire of used DVD's in my collection that I may or may not watch a second time.
""V - The Original Mini-series; Mankind's Last Stand"" is in English or French, with subtitles in English, French, or Spanish.  You'll definitely see several actors and actresses who have starred in many Sci-Fi genre shows, and there were subsequent TV ongoing sequels after ""V - The Final Battle"" including one that came out in 2009.  One thing to keep in mind as you watch the earliest 1983 production version, is that regular TV told the writers and producers that it was too cerebral for the average American viewer.  Even considering it came out in 1983, I found it juvenile, amateurish, and patronizing; but then, I'm a published author with a 4 year college education.  Perhaps the regular TV broadcasting executives are actually correct in their assumption.",1337817600,,2270,4.413875598086125

The fact is, widescreen, on the average home TV set, ""steals"" half the picture. If you're like me and watch your movies on a 17"" monitor, you're really only getting about 10"" worth of picture.

573994,1,6303101178,"As a big fan of the newer series, I wanted to see where all the fuss about the original show came from.  If the show was popular enough to warrent a remake 20 plus years later, it must be a classic.  Or not.

Maybe there's a generation gap, but I couldn't see the appeal.  Some of the characters were well developed, and I suppose the special effects were decent enough given that this movie was filmed in the 80's.  Everything was forced, from the dialog to the plot leading to minor character development.  All in all, though, it just dragged.  I kept watching it because I wanted to see the whole thing before making a judgement.  Although the ending improved the movie slightly, it was too little, too late.

It's possible that the story improves with the next set of DVDs, but I wasted enough money on the first set.  Although I might donate the miniseries to my library in the event that they will be popular, it's more likely they'll sit on the shelves unwatched.

There have been some complaints about the quality of the season two V series remake.  It appears that people are forgetting the quality of V's origin.  Or, perhaps, people are so used to watching poor TV that they no longer recognize quality.  Skip the original and buy the ""Complete First Season"" instead.",1300838400,,1278,4.548245614035087
573995,4,6303101178,"The last time I saw this miniseries was in 1983 or 84, when I was a mere 28 and still into TV series.  Now I'm well into my 50s and no longer interested in TV serials.  However, I am currently revisiting the V mythology, due to the new season, and I am amazed at how good the original series was, despite the advances in technology and TV storytelling in the past 10 years and some hokiness that plagued science fiction serials in the 70s and 80s (platitudinous scripting, morality tales, good guy vs. bad guy, preachiness, monocultural presentation, etc.).  Compared to the new series, much of it sound and video bites in the CSI tradition, with largely two-dimensional characters, there is surprisingly decent attention to character development and relationships between the characters in the older series. Jane Badler's Diana is my favorite, and her character acting is the main reason why I was able to watch the earlier series through to the conclusion.  Badler changes and evolves her character in subtle and clever ways, from the original miniseries, through V: The Final Conflict and esp. throughout the 1984/5 Complete Season.  She makes a great villain, who is wicked, conniving and ruthless, and yet whose villainy is also in some ways undone by her own fascination with the human race and the growing complexity of her character's multiple motivations. Diana's role alone is worth the price of the ticket.  The original miniseries is still worthwhile for viewing, even in the light of the newer and glitzier seasons (2009-11).",1299801600,4,1538,4.964980544747082

574061,4,6303101178,"I greatly enjoyed watching this with pals when it came out.  We would gather round the TV, drinks in hand, and shout and laugh our way through each episode.  The plot is interstellar invasion, with the aliens posing as friendly only to have their plans later revealed, along with the horror of their alienness. THe story is quite complex, particularly when the aliens' plans go awry, first from the actions of some apparent xenophobic terrorists and then as a worldwide rebellion.

But what really makes this special is the strong characters.  There is the swashbuckling reporter, who uncovers a lot.  Then there is the medical student who becomes a reluctant leader, whose natural strength and charisma surprise even her.  Of course, there are the paramilitary brutes, also indispensable but in constant conflict with principled the do-gooders.  The aliens are also interesting, from the corrupted under-commander to the turncoats.  The acting is truly fine, with most of them relatively unknown character actors.

To be honest, there are a number of overly ambitious themes that run throughout this.  The comparison to the US influence in Central America at that time is, to put it mildly, heavy handed.  There is also a message of brotherhood across species that is rather pretentious, including the affair between a troubled human adolescent girl and a manipulative and ambitious alien soldier.  While lacking in nuance, these themes do not ruin the series.

Recommended.  This is fun, even as it appears clunky and old fashioned when we compare it to the visual effects we can get today.  It is character-based and the plot sustains the viewer's interest throughout, with enough surprises to make for solid scifi.",1288483200,,1718,5.129496402877698

And this sci-fi movie series is very good.  But please tell me, because I am confused, how is a movie that that was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio get released as a widescreen ratio?

This is physically impossible.  And the only thing I see that they did was chop off the original top and bottom of the movie frames, and make it appear as though it is widecreen.  And with this, we lose some of the original production frame.  To me this is stupid.  I love and only buy widesreen format films unless the original movie was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio.  And the reason for this is because I want all of the original frame that was filmed by the film maker weither it is 1.33:1 or 2.35:1, etc.

Even better is Kenneth Johnson's director commentary as a special features option.  Johnson narrates from beginning to end.  His dialogue is tied to the scenes at hand and is a virtual cornucopia of behind the scenes production information, trivia, and memories verbalized as clearly as if the film production concluded only yesterday.  Johnson's explanation of film techniques alone almost seems to constitute a semester's worth of a film production class.

Overall a first rate production.

The plot for those who care to read it again: A seemingly humanoid race arrives on Earth with dozens of enormous mother ships Earth to assist mankind.  All they ask in return is the ability to process synthetic chemicals to bring back to their planet.  Quickly however the Visitors, as they are known, facilitate social unrest that is wholesale blamed on those employed in the science profession.  Scientists are blamed for attempting to derail the Visitor's goodwill, open acts of sabotage, and are linked to an alleged world-wide conspiracy to withhold medical cures purely for the sake of extorting research funds.  As such scientists are treated in much the way the Jewish population faired during the Holocaust.  In the meantime people continue to disappear without a trace much like the Nacht and Nebel degrees of Nazi Germany.  The Visitors even supplement their ranks with human volunteers in local Visitor militia groups much like storm troopers of the 1930's. The Visitors, having taken world leaders into their protective custody, enforce martial law.

All is not lost as a brave band of resistance fighters, led by Julie Parrish and Mike Donovan, methodically assemble a force to fight the visitors.  Mike Donovan, formerly one of the news cameramen welcomed by the Visitors, has seen the Visitors in their true reptilian form.  He quickly discovers that the aim of the Visitors is to rob the Earth of its water and enslave the population.  Humans are primed by the Visitors as potential impressed soldiers for the leader's army, as well as a source of food for the Visitors.  The resistance is not alone in its struggle as there are a handful of aliens who do not support their leader's aims.

The first miniseries concludes with the resistance having emerged victorious from a nominal battle and preparing for the next engagement.

The mini series moves along smartly.  There is no useless dialogue or prolonged scenes to overly exhibit expensive sets.  Much as I enjoyed V: THE FINAL BATTLE I readily admit that the original television series is far superior.  THE FINAL BATTLE picked up where the first series left off, but quickly devolved into a more drawn out production.  Lacking Kenneth Johnson at the helm and a reduced budget, the second mini series lacked the creative camera work, superb editing, and tight dialogue of the original.  Kenneth Johnson pitched a sequel that would have ignored the second mini-series and weekly television production, but Warner Brothers (who own the television rights to the series) opted to remake the series for ABC.  Johnson's sequel eventually ended up as a book.

For reasons that still escape me I missed the original May 1983 broadcast of V.  I did not become a fan of the series until early 1984 when I saw V: THE FINAL BATTLE and was later able to watch a summer rebroadcast of both mini series prior to the airing of the weekly television series.  Much as I admired both mini series and the television show, I admit that I always felt THE FINAL BATTLE's ending was rushed.  The instant resolution with the simple release of red dust was too hurried and not in keeping with the original mini series.

Ultimately V: THE ORIGINAL TV MINISERIES is a superior effort.  I recommend that after you watch the film that you watch it again with Kenneth Johnson's commentary.",1269907200,8,4282,4.9915373765867415

Then when my husband and I decided to watch the new revised V series shown on newark TV this past fall, all I heard from him was how much better the original was.  So, I bought him this DVD set as a Christmas gift sot hat we could watch it together.  And I do believe that he was right.  Unlike the slow-moving remake, the original story is action packed, with the resistance getting underway much more quickly.  Furthermore, there are more obvious comparisons between the Vs and the Nazis made here.  The acting is strong, and most of the special effects are surprisingly well-done for 80s TV, with only a few moments leaning more towards the cheesy side.  Special effects include commentary by the screenwriter/director alone--sounds boring, but he actually manages to offer a wealth of interesting information about the movie.  There is also an approximately 25 minute ""Behind-the-Scenes"" segment which includes interviews with two of the stars, Marc Singer and Faye Grant.  Over all, this is a great purchase for fans of the series and one that will not disappoint, even 25 years later--it gets four and a half stars from me.",1262217600,5,1286,4.756756756756757
574230,5,6303101178,"For those like me who have recently rediscovered the ""V"" franchise thanks to ABC's 2009/10 remake, you will probably find that the 1980s ""Original Miniseries"" is better than the modern version in some ways, and worse in others:

Obviously, the special effects are MUCH better this time around--and yet the 1980s version still holds up suprisingly well on this score.

Personally, I think the acting is a little better in the 2009/10 version than it is in the 1980s version. But at the same time, the acting in the 1980s isn't at all ""bad""--it's just not as good (and besides, nobody really watches V for the acting quality). Yet at the same time, I think Jane Badler's performance as ""Dianna"" is better than Morena Baccarin's performance as ""Anna""--yet, again, Morena is very good in her own way.

Finally, the 1980s version was MUCH better written than the 2009/10 remake: The pace of the storyline and plot is just much faster in the 1980s version. For instance, the 80s version gives you a lot more lizard face ""peel-offs"" much sooner versus 2009/10 version. The 1980s version is also faster in terms of revealing the visitors' true motive for coming to Earth.",1261872000,,1163,4.805

574233,5,6303101178,"I remembered watching ""V"" when it first aired back in 1983. At the time this was reportedly one of the most expensive TV miniseries' ever made, and it's easy to see why. But in the end all the money that was spent to make this miniseries paid off. It was very well received by the critics, and it became one of the most watched TV miniseries' of the first half of the '80s.

""V"" is the ultimate TV sci-fi extravaganza: aliens (who look like humans) from a planet far away come to Earth in gigantic, saucer-shaped motherships that hover over the world's major cities (most of the action here takes place in Los Angeles). Calling themselves the Visitors, they claim that they have come in peace, and begin to integrate themselves with the humans of earth. They also claim that they need special chemicals and minerals to aid their dying world. But strange events start to occur (ordinary people disappear; bizarre accidents happen, etc.), and some people discover that everything the Visitors have said has turned out to be a lie. A TV cameraman named Mike Donovan finds his way onto one of the motherships and makes a shocking discovery: the Visitors are actually lizard-like reptiles (which is revealed after the cameraman gets into a fight with one of them and rips off the aliens' human-like skin) who's main goal is to steal all of the Earth's water and use millions of human people as food. The cameraman joins a group known as the resistance movement led by Juliet Parrish, a female medical student. Their plans are to expose and oppose the Visitors. Their symbol is V for victory, which is spray-painted over the Visitors' posters that are posted all over Los Angeles. This resistance movement plan to fight for their planet. Their message to the Visitors: this is war! And yes, the ending clearly sets up a sequel (""V: The Final Battle"", which aired a year later).

In my opinion, ""V"" (The Original Miniseries) is one of the very best TV miniseries' ever made. I just viewed this great science fiction epic again (on DVD), and it hasn't lost its touch. Extremely well written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, it's got spectacular special effects (for its time), exciting action, a terrific story, and lots of interesting characters that we get to know and care about. Best of all, the DVD transfer is superb (with the presentation shown in widescreen instead of full screen, which is how it originally aired on television since widescreen presentations weren't available on television back in 1983). Marc Singer and Faye Grant do an exceptional job in the principal leading roles of Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish, respectively. And there's lots of good work from the supporting actors, which include many actors who would later turn up in hit movies or TV shows. These include: Bonnie Bartlett (""St. Elsewhere""), Joanna Kerns (""Growing Pains""), William Russ (""Boy Meets World""), and Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies).

574234,1,6303101178,"It doesn't seem so long ago that when movies on VHS were cropped on the left and right to fit 4:3 screens, people were indignant over losing a third or more of the original image. Producers responded with letterbox format, which then consisted of adding black bars at the top and bottom to preserve the entire original image.

Now for DVD release, older TV shows are cropped at the top and bottom so the original 4:3 image will fit 16:9 screens. Sometimes they now call this letterboxing! Where is the indignation? Why are there so many five-star ratings on Amazon for the V miniseries without mention of how the image was mutilated?

In fact when the first season of Route 66 was released with the top and bottom cropped, there was much indignation, and the producers responded by re-releasing the season in its original format.

I hope fans of V and other great shows will think about this when posting reviews and ratings. The more people give these versions low ratings and state why, the more likely that producers will do the right thing and stop cropping these shows.",1259107200,13,1074,4.671957671957672

574236,5,6303101178,"If a ninety-nine out of a hundred science fiction films fall into being clich ridden, one will stand out above the rest. V, in its original miniseries, would be one of those that stands above the rest. V is anything but your typical science fiction story of an alien invasion. It is a tale of a fascist (alien) takeover of our society and the resistance of a few in a society to it. As a result V, while a product of the technology and culture of the 1980's, is a timeless piece of science fiction.

One of the elements to V's success is its cast. Leading, so to speak, the cast of human characters are Marc Singer as cameraman Mike Donovan and Faye Grant as med-student turned rebel leader Julie Parrish. Both Singer and Grant give nice performances that, for the most part, come across as real people in extraordinary situations. In fact the performances of the entire cast be described by that last phrase as well ranging from the Maxwell family (Michael Durrell, Penelope Windust as the parents with Blair Tefkin, Viveka Davis and Marin May as their daughters) who find themselves persecuted to the point of joining the resistance much like the Taylor family (Jason Bernard, Richard Lawson and Michael Wright) to the Bernstein family (George Morfogen, Bonnie Bartlett) who find themselves torn between their Visitor friendly son Daniel (David Packer) and the Holocaust survivor grandfather Abraham (Leonardo Cimino). In fact the single best scene involves Abraham, who is wanting to hide the persecuted Maxwell's, reminding his son that this whole situation is all too familiar for the consequences of them not being hidden means ""we haven't learned a thing"". This is a scene that is not only well acted and well written but incredibly rare in your average science fiction story as well. There's also many other fine members of the cast including Neva Patterson (Donovan's mom), Evan Kim (Donovan's camera partner Tony), Jenny Sullivan (reporter turned Visitor spokeswoman Kristine Walsh) and Kristine Walsh (as Gardener turned rebel Sancho) amongst many others. The human side of the cast is just the tip of the iceberg though.

There's also a fine cast playing the alien ""visitors"" as well. They range from their seemingly benevolent leader John (played briefly and well by Richard Herd) to Andrew Prine as the authoritative Steven. Then there's the innocent abroad in the form of Robert Englund as Willie and the resistance from within the visitors themselves in the form of Frank Ashmore as Martin and Jenny Neumann as Barbara. Then there is Jane Badler as Diana, perhaps the most attractive and conniving of the alien visitors, who plays the role with a seriousness not usually found in this kind of role. Together they form one of the best, and definitely one of the most diverse, cast of alien invaders ever assembled.

V is also aided by fine work behind the camera. There's the cinematography of John McPherson especially the tracking shot of characters watching the first contact sequence and the scenes in the mother-ship. The production design in the form of the mother ship interiors are fine examples of science fiction sets. There's also the special effects work ranging from the excellent shots of mother-ships (a decade plus before Independence Day) to the aerial dogfight at the end which all work marvelously for the most part despite a very few shots which don't look quite finished. No review of V is complete without mentioned the fine prosthetic work of the miniseries which range from the Visitors true faces to some rather uncomfortable dining sequences. Last, but not least by any means, is the fine score by composer Joe Harnell which takes puts together classical music influences and choir in one of the most unusual and best scores produced for any science fiction television piece I have heard, especially for the opening and closing credits of any part. In short: strong production values go a long way.

To my mind V's ultimate success lies in the script and direction of Kenneth Johnson. V was originally conceived not as a science fiction tale of alien invasion but as the tale of a fascist takeover of the U.S which can still be found deeply embedded in the final product. In fact that is what separates V from many other alien invasion stories. V is about fascism, how people can be lured in by it, how far those in power will go to secure their position, how the average person will react and what happens when ordinary people stand up to resist it. There's also more then a few hints of Nazi Germany as well from the Swastika-like symbol of the Visitors to Friends of the Visitors youth groups (the Hitler Youth) and, before the miniseries is over with, a strong allegory with the Holocaust as well (see the miniseries to get it). Wisely Johnson also puts a fair (but not gratitude) amount of action in as well which helps to compliment the story and move it along. V is embedded in the technology and culture of the 1980's when it was made to sure but that doesn't date the story at all. Instead V becomes, like H.G. Welles War of the Worlds before it, a timeless tale of alien invasion and human resistance to it.

What makes V successful? Well it's large cast of fine actors, nice cinematography, good special effects work, excellent prosthetic work and fine score go along way. Yet the true success of V lies in its script and story. Why? Because ultimately V is not about spaceships and ray-guns but is about people and their reactions to the extraordinary events around them.",1257897600,,5524,4.810526315789474
574237,5,6303101178,"Los Angeles, 1983: Hundreds of massive flying saucers inexplicably appear in the skies over the major cities of the world. Panic ensues as attempts by the military to intercept them prove fruitless. Before the situation can escalate further out of control, the world is informed by the occupants of the craft that they come in peace and desire a meeting with the head of the United Nations atop the headquarters of that illustrious organisation in New York. During this meeting, which is attended by a battery of the world's press, the world gets it first glimpse of the ""visitors"": they look and sound like just us - although they're possessed of rather unusual voices - and they are visiting in a spirit of d&eacute;tente and mutual exchange; seeking our aid in their fight against dramatic climatic change which is destroying their planet. In return, they are prepared to share the fruits of their advanced scientific technology. However, before long it becomes apparent to an increasing number of people effected by the visitor's growing dominance in human society, that all is not what it seems and that their motives are anything but philanthropic...

The brainchild of ""Bionic Woman"" and ""Incredible Hulk"" alumnus, Kenneth Johnson, ""V"" was inspired by Sinclair Lewis' novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Can-t-Happen-Here/dp/045121658X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Can't Happen Here</a>. Johnson's initial conception of the idea was originally entitled ""Storm Warnings"" and was a speculative examination of the possible rise to power of domestic fascism within the United States. However, Johnson was persuaded by a network executive at NBC to introduce an extra-terrestrial element and the result is one of the best mini-series ever broadcast on American television and one of the best pieces of Wellsian science fiction to reach an audience in a populist medium.

Essentially an examination of how a cross section of citizens within a democratic liberal society can be seduced, frightened, coerced, beaten into submission and driven to armed struggle by a totalitarian dictatorship, it remains an absolutely chilling viewing experience. While it may occasionally suffer from the more glitzy action oriented/soap operatic trappings of the eighties mini-series zeitgeist, for the most part it remains a disturbingly astute examination of the loss of liberty and the birth of coordinated resistance to totalitarianism. Watching it again recently, I found that it was not the more grotesque revelations of the visitor's natures and appetites that unsettled me, but their insidious insinuation into every aspect of public and private life (ultimately culminating in a contemporary media-savvy interpretation of the burning of the Reichstag which the Visitors implement and use as a pretext in order to justify their subsequent coup d'&eacute;tat and draconian institution of martial law) and the look of growing dread that begins to haunt the features of Leonardo Cimino's elderly Holocaust survivor as he realises that he is witnessing history repeat itself.

Listening to the commentary on this DVD is a delight and provides all manner of fascinating insights into the series. Kenneth Johnson knows his history and eloquently explains the ingredients and processes that went into making this landmark piece of television. Amongst the tidbits on offer are the revelations that fictitious news anchor Christine Walsh was very deliberately based on Nazi film-maker and propagandist, Leni Riefenstahl, and that Johnson consciously tried to write a goodly portion of the dialogue in Iambic Meter.

""V - The Mini-Series"" ends without your traditional Hollywood resolution. Johnson's intention was clearly to examine the idea of the rise of fascism in contemporary society - not to posit a solution or offer his characters an easy way out. The story was however continued and concluded a year later in an inferior sequel called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-The-Final-Battle/dp/B000067FP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V - The Final Battle</a>&nbsp;(from which Johnson walked during production due to creative differences with the studio) which amped up the soap opera, science fiction and action elements and which featured a rather ridiculous ending which resorted to bad science fiction cliches.

574239,4,6303101178,"Like anything from the early to mid-80s, there is going to be that twinge of nostalgic quality interlaced in your memory of what was good and what wasn't.  When I was a kid I watched The Dukes of Hazzard and Dallas every Friday night.  The Love Boat and Fantasy Island every Saturday night.  I lived through The Sonny & Cher Show from the 70s.  I was there at the birth and demise of shows like Happy Days, Luverne & Shirley, Diff'rent Strokes, Family Ties & so many more.  What was good and what wasn't?  V.  That was good.  V.  The ultimate invaders from Mars taking over the planet while we dumb Earthlings stand around and gawk.  V.

Marc Singer (The Beastmaster, If You Could See What I Hear) plays the tough-as-nails cameraman Mike Donovan in the opeing scenes, racing through the conflict in El Salvador like some leftover footage from the A-Team.  Suddenly a gigantic spaceship fills the sky.  50 such ships hover over the major cities of the world (it's funny some of the cities they considered major at the time. New Orleans? El Salvador?) while humanity scrambles around looking for answers.  The Visitor's make their presence known and they are just like us.  Yeah!  They come in peace and need our help to manufacture a chemical compound that will help their distant society survive.  Their Supreme Leader John looks just like any middle-aged man with the exception of his strange voice and his need for bulky eyewear.  Otherwise, everthing is just hunky dory.  Mike Donovan, with the help of a charismatic anchorwoman and his asian sidekick are invited to film up at the mothership hovering over Los Angeles.  Great.  Up there they meet the beautiful and cold Diana (Jane Baldler, one of the great baddies of the 80s, right up there with Larry Hagman's J.R. Ewing and Joan Collin's Alexis) and get a chance to tour the facilities of the mothership to show Earth what they're up to. The Visitor's are so nice, so cool, so helpful...  Enter the fascist state of bedlam.  Scientists around the world are accused of conspiracy and the threat of sabotaging the Visitor's motherships.  Nazi Germany has been reinstated.  Young people are recruited into little cliqes, turning in scientific sympathizers and selling out their parents when they're questioned.  Hysteria.  Martial law. Mike Donovan sneaks into the mothership to discover something terrifying.  The Visitor's are actually rat-eating reptilian monsters and they're steaing the Earth's water for their own as well as sealing away people like frozen dinners aboard their giant spaceships.  He narrowly escapes capture with the aid of some Visitors who don't believe in the overall plan of planet-wide domination.  Donovan becomes Public Enemy #1. The rebellion against the Visitor's is born.

V is definitely a first installment measure of a larger beast and we recognized this even back in 1984 when the mini-series first came out.  It ends quickly and you know that this is just the beginning.  The 80s were not kind now that we look back and have a chance to realize what everything looked like.  The feathered hair and bulky clothing.  The fact that anyone thought Marc Singer was a heartthrob with his chiseled baboon face.  Cliches aplenty.  Robert Englund as the quirky, feel-sorry-for-me Visitor Willie, which is hysterical, because the whole time you're looking at his goofy face, you're saying IT'S FREDDY KRUEGER!!!!  Lots of outdated special effects and hammy, cloying dialogue.  Lots of in-your-face wow isn't this just like Nazi Germany innuendos.  But when you strip past all that stuff, you have a great mini-series with a great plot that was still somewhat fresh back then.  It's been beaten to death by now, but it worked in '84.  Nostalgia will coat over some of the glaring inconsistencies, and you feel yourself smiling at what we were wearing back then, thinking that we were so cool.  The non PC parts are funny as well, the stereotypical characters with their stereotypical dialogues, and you will love that regular TV wasn't so straight-laced back then.  All in all V is what it is, a great end-of-times invasion epic with Sci-fi trappings.  The nod at the fascist threat (Communism was sill very alive back then) made it poignant and gritty in it's day.  This paved the way for so many movies after.

Epic.

574330,5,6303101178,"When first aired, ""V"" became an instant pop culture phenomenon in Sweden. I don't remember the exact year. 1985?

At the time, Swedish TV was very old fashioned. There were only two channels, both of them public service! Imagine growing up with only two TV channels. (The kids played chess, caught newts in the local stream, read Franco-Belgian cartoons. So no, we weren't suffering.)

Besides, the fact that there were only two channels made *everyone* in Sweden watch ""V"", both the original miniseries and the three-part sequel, known as ""V: The Final Battle"". In fact, people were shocked by Diana eating that rabbit and turning out to be a lizard. The day after, tabloids prominently featured Diana's eating habits (complete with a large photo). Since we were really smart kids, one of us knew that the whole thing was a Nazi allegory. Scientists equal Jews, right?

""V: The Original Miniseries"" and ""V: The Final Battle"" were showed in a row, so we had five weeks of reptilian entertainment. Well, almost. Many viewers were confused by the third episode (actually the first episode of ""Final Battle""), and assumed that the TV channel was broadcasting the wrong one. Thousands of viewers called Swedish television, which promptly stopped showing it! Confusion followed. The poor employee responsible for ""V"" had called it a day, and the other episodes were locked up in his office. Nobody could find a spare key! After much embarrassment, the channel finally realized that they were showing the right episode after all, and resumed airing it. New problems followed, as thousands of people who had programmed their VCR's missed a large portion. Finally, Swedish television had to show an extraordinary re-run of the third episode, only a couple of days later!

Thank God for public service.

We enjoyed both ""V: The Original"" and ""V: The Final Battle"". Everyone assumed that this was the entire series. Then, the newspapers revealed that there were an additional 19 episodes! WHAT???? People felt cheated, and ratings dropped (but since the network was government-controlled, they didn't have to care about it.) After the episode featuring The Big Murderous Alien Dressed In Black, a small Communist group filed a complaint against Swedish television, charging them with ""fascist propaganda"" (which, of course, is verboten). Presumably, they didn't catch the Nazi analogy. And yes, we all liked Robert Englund, the nice and cozy alien!

Today, ""V"" feels very dated. Still, ""V: The Original Miniseries"" and ""V: The Final Battle"" are classics. You might as well skip ""V: The Series"", however. I don't consider it canonical.

Finally, I just have to mention David Icke. OK, now it's done.",1254009600,,2688,5.109339407744875

But considering I have not seen the mini series in over twenty years...I thought I would buy it to make sure my childhood memories did not betray me.  I bought the disk thinking that it would be a nice, but cheesy addition to my sci fi collection.  I was half right.  The series was a pleasant surprise.  It was just as good as I remembered it to be, and the effects for a 1983 television show are surprising good in my opinion.  The writing in this mini series is outstanding, and like the rest of it still holds up today.

That's the reason I let nostalgia do it's thing and bought ""V: Original TV Miniseries"" (let's call it Part 1), ""V The Final Battle"" (Part 2) and ""V: The Complete Series"" (Part 3). The first two sets are the best: they have intelligent plots, well-constructed characters and a cast pretty-enough to ensure happy viewers. The problem is that the special effects are terrible. And when it comes to the third set (V: The Complete Series), it looks like the producers kinda lost the angle, since it is more predictable and broke many of the rules they had for the first two. For example, on this one, aliens don't have the strange voice they used to in the first two.

574334,5,6303101178,"The hay day of the mini-series was the 1980's and they usual told complex stories that couldn't be told in  a one night tv movie. But this one was different from the rest. This was the only sci-fi I remember from the era in this format.

It was well done. A good story, an intriguing plot and good acting. Viewing this again, I see that the underlying tones were about Nazi invasion and the resistance fighters against them. A view that might have been missed by younger viewers at the time. But there is much for sci-fi fans as well. An alein species coming from another world pretending to bring peace, but instead they came for other reasons. Controling the elite, the government and the media they used people of this world to do their bidding of robbing it of its resources. Those that didn't believe or turned a blind eye were part of humanity's distruction, while everyone else turned to being a freedom fighter.

This is an excellant dvd. Despite being made for tv it is presented in widescreen so we can see how the show was really shot. It also has comentary from the creator and a making of documentary. A must have for sci-fi fans.",1243123200,2,1143,4.485576923076923
574335,4,6303101178,"""V: The Miniseries"" captured the attention of the 80s.  It was what American audiences needed after such success of ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"", it was a new chapter of science fiction, and the marketing gurus behind it were ready to make history.  Released in 1983, this short chapter is part of a bigger idea, but it was a powerful start to that idea.  Randomly, what I invisioned a Tuesday afternoon, the sky is flooded with huge alien spacecraft ready to make contact.  We are scared, the flush of the unknown is heavy, but as soon as we see that they look just like us - we are calmed.  They want resources, talk of a dying planet, and even during a Cold War, we - the nations of the world - extend an open hand to them.  It is the beginning of the end ... well, so to speak.

Nearly 26 years after its original release on television, ""V: The Miniseries"" is continually voted one of the top cult shows of the 80s, and one can agree - it is a poineering show for television, but the pressing question is - does it still hold up after all of these years?  With CGI a staple in Hollywood, and the science fiction genre proving to be a lucrative endeavor, does ""V"" feel all-powerful, or is it just another hokie film masquerading history with reptilian creatures?  Passivly, the responce is yes.  ""V"" (excluding ""The Final Battle"") was a fantastic miniseries in the 80s, and continues to provide unparalleled entertainment today.  What lacks in an elongated story pressured by history, it overloads with magnificent visuals.  Consider ""V"" in the 80s to be the ""Battlestar Galactica"" of today -- thrilling characters, the idea of the unknown, and the creatures that will leave a lasting, and iconic, impression for weeks after viewing.  Yet, a modern viewing will have to patiently wait for the reward as it arrives in waves throughout the entire three hours.  A bold opening, the over-zealous spacecraft appearing in the skyline, the fear of the unknown, and the arrival of those red suits will pull you in, but then it slows as we introduce characters (both big and small), and further bring connections between 1983 and German influences in the 1940s.  Patience is more than a virtue with this series, as it is important to watch through the ending, there are just small details that pull away from the overall impact of the show.  The scientist elimination and discrimination was random - at first - having to readjust your concept of ""why"" - we are jolted from a sudden disappearance to a hatred from both the alien race and human.  It was shocking to see how quickly one human could turn on another - but again - it was at that time when Kenneth Johnson was pushing the German/Jewish undertones.  A stronger transition from alien arrival to a debunk of social standards would make the flow stronger, and allow modern eyes to adjust.

This said, ""V: The Miniseries"" is more than just your 8pm Wednesday science fiction, it is symbolic, hurtful, idealistic, charming, incredibly 80s, and pioneering for today's television.  Between this and Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"", it is shameful to think ""Lost"" is that creative.  ""V"" is a great show to watch, and from a personal standpoint, I loved watching everything Johnson brought to the screen.  The posters within the film are as vibrant and vintage as when released.  The visual of red spraypaint creating that V on the cartoonish prints are just as important as that of the first discovery of the reptile.  It was a slice of my youth, but it is not a show that I could watch again and again.  The intensity was high, the acting was mid-level, and the central story (outside of the action-packed intro and outro) was mediocre at best.  I wanted to fall back in love with this show, but the middle drama was overly symbolic.  I didn't need overbearing Nazi implications, I wanted to discover it for myself.  Johnson, again, did a great job - just a bit too pushy with the message.

The DVD itself was not as sharp as modern discs, but it was an 80s TV show.  It felt like it was coming on TV for the first time, complete with lackluster colors and over-budgeted special effects.  I liked this style and release, and am highly excited about jumping into ""The Final Battle"".  For this chapter, I liked what I saw - what I was re-exposed to - I just didn't love it as I did was I was 7.

574338,5,6303101178,"To those of us old enough to remember when V first aired, we can tell you that-for its' time- it was quite the event. Millions watched the special and wasn't disappointed in the least. It was talked about for weeks on TV.

The show begins with Mike Donovan filming violence in El Salvador when a spacecraft suddenly appears and draws near. Other ships start to arrive. Some worldwide. It isn't long before the commander of the craft invites the Secretary General of the United Nations to make first contact. Introducing himself as John, he states that their world is in the throes of an environmental catastrophe and that they need Earth's help to survive. In exchange for helping them come up with the materials they need, they will share their scientific knowledge with the people of Earth. Donovan and television reporter Kristine Walsh are selected to go aboard the massive mothership hovering over Los Angeles. There they meet the Visitor's second-in-command, Diana, and get a tour of the spacecraft. Donovan sneaks back aboard the ship when he makes a discovery and finds himself trying to find a way out as the Visitors try to stop him. The real reason for their arrival is made clear and the humans start a revolt against them. That's when things start to get exciting. I won't give it away but it is something you have to see.

It was written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, whom some of you may know was the man behind TV's The Incredible Hulk and The Bionic Woman. The movie starred: Marc Singer, Faye Grant, Michael Ironside, Jenny Sullivan, Jane Badler, Richard Herd, Robert Englund(pre-Freddy Krueger, of course), Andrew Prine and Peter Nelson. DVD extras include: Audio Commentary by Kenneth Johnson, a 25-minute behind-the-scenes documentary and a cast and crew list. Not much but I'm not knocking things...at least they did have some extras.

It stands as one of NBC's biggest hits. It's a movie every SCI-FI fan should see. I highly recommend this. You'll love it.",1237852800,3,1983,4.8609467455621305
574339,5,6303101178,"First of all, I love this miniseries and I loved it ever since it first came out when I was a young teen and I entirely forgot about it until a few years ago when I was browsing through Amazon and nostalgia had me buy it.  Seeing it as an adult was an entirely different experience.

Here's a plot synopsis.  50 giant space saucer ships, the size of cities, arrive at earth from Sirius (a nearby star).  The ships take station over the large cities of the world.  The aliens ask for contact from the people of earth and we discover that the aliens are suprisingly human in appearance.  They tell the the people of Earth that they need to set up some refineries on earth to manufacture a chemical that is nontoxic but which they require.  In exchange, they will share technology with the people of earth.

All seems good -- or does it?  Watch the miniseries to find out all the hidden agendas.  The miniseries follows the adventures of a diverse group of people brought together by these developments: a newsreporter, a regular family, an ambitious woman, and others.  The miniseries also follows the doings of the leaders of the invasion force as well as some minor characters within the occupation.

The show is definitely 1980s and still has the feel of a hangover from the 1970s with some big hair, tight jeans, and 1980s language and filming.

Overall, its a great romp through memory lane.  I must say that watching the show as a kid was interesting as a sci fi flick but watching it today as an adult after 20+ years of living and learning, you can see quite a bit of WWII Nazi occupation in the show. If you look closely at the insignia of the aliens you can tell its a swastika with two of the arms replaced with dots.  So definitely, there are some undertones to this movie that make it worth watching.  I'd say that the undertones and broader allegorical allusions to WWII and life under Nazi occupation really made a 1980s made for tv movie watchable.

Definitely get it.  There's a great scene in the movie where an old man, a survivor from the holocaust, teaches a younger man about symbology and about organized resistance to oppression.  Definitely worth watching.  Its also a fun little sci fi movie with solid acting by most of the cast and it even has a guest appearance by Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger).  The main protagonist is Marc Singer who plays his role very well as an investigative adventure reporter cameraman.

574431,5,6303101178,"Unfortunately, that's one of several reminders I throw out there whenever I'm trying to find out if someone has ever watched V before.

Eating live rodents, harvesting humans for food, and stealing the earth's water supply are not usually the big plot items that turn people onto a TV show or movie.  And yet in 1983, everyone was glued to their television sets to watch V.  (And even those who weren't were joining the throng of fans a year later for V: THE FINAL BATTLE.)  Perhaps, it's because, although most people are not science fiction fans, they will watch a science fiction show (or movie) that has a non-sci-fi element as its primary vehicle.  For instance, there are the mythological and mystical aspects of the STAR WARS saga.  Many feel that there's a theological theme to the MATRIX trilogy.

In the same vein, V is undoubtedly a World War II/Holocaust allegory.  The Visitors' emblem looks very similar to a swastika.  They post propaganda posters all over the place.  They establish the Visitor Friends Group in every major city (equivalent to the Hitler Youth).  The Visitors require all scientists and their families to be registered; these same scientists (with their families) are often the target of outrageous persecutions and false accusations of conspiring against the Visitors.

V is the quintessential cheesy 80s melodrama.  There are no fabulous performances in V, and none of the principle actors went on to bigger and better careers.  The special effects, though unremarkable by today's standards, were way ahead of the game 25 years ago.  (And many of the special effects sequences are recycled not only throughout this series but also throughout V: THE FINAL BATTLE and V: THE SERIES).

The unique thing V does offer is fun, exciting, intriguing, and action-packed family entertainment.  And this kind of entertainment was delivered at a time when family entertainment was, unfortunately, going rapidly out of style.",1218931200,3,1947,5.072327044025157
574432,5,6303101178,"V the mini series and it's sequel V the final battle are great SF. Tough the special effects are not up to today's standard, this is more than compensated for by the interesting storyline (a parable about the naziregime) and protagonists who are real people with real faults and doubts. Some become collaborators, some become heroes against their will, but there are no black and white characters all good or all bad, except for Diana (a Dr. Mengele-like character only with real power, not a follower like Mengele was).
Together these two form an epic story of real interest.
Unfortunately the formula was milked into a television series (V The complete series) wich has deteriorated to mediocre or less. The stories have become childish, the characters have flattened out to two-dimensional. Shots of entering shuttles and the docking bay are recycled endlessly etc. The ending is very unsatisfying, because it doesn't really end but an opening is left for a sequel of the series which fortunately never came to pass.",1218326400,,1019,5.0

Even at that level I was able to thoroughly enjoy the entire series.  It wasn't until as an adult while viewing this again on dvd did the Nazi analogy become obvious to me and although the effects lack the CGI touch of today, I'm still impressed at just how good they were even for today.

Few television series from my childhood age well and so I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I still enjoyed viewing this dvd after more than 25 years.  ""V"" has even aged better than ""Battlestar Galactica"" for me which takes quite some doing.

The sound quality in Dolby Surround is also very good and although the picture quality isn't perfect as there are still spots and other imperfections, they are not very widespread and do not detract too much from the overall viewing experience.  This is just half the story though as you will need to get the follow-up ""The Final Battle"" to see how it all ends.

574512,3,6303101178,"I was curious as to what ""V"" is about since it ties in with the great conspiracy theory that our planet is in truth secretly (or not so secretly) ruled by lizards from outer space ... I missed the original broadcast while serving in the United States Navy and secretly (or not so secretly) fighting our own aliens in the military. Could there be some vital clue in this series to the overall conspiracy that I missed?

Well, if bad acting and hokey scripting is a part of the scheme ... V has it covered. Yet, V has a certain 80's charm. The 80s was a decade of difficult transition from the disco-wild 70s to the super-fueled cocaine-driven business savvy seriousness we all ended up with. While the population crawled over each other for upward mobility it seems popular culture suffered more than ever before. Fashion, popular music (not punk), television and film reached all-time lows of absurdity and lack of creativity. So, what we're left with are some of the shows that still hold charm during this wacky decade.

Marc Singer is a big part of V's charm, but only because he seems to wholly sum up the bad acting of the time--with his chin held high. We know he isn't a great actor, but he seems like a damn nice guy, so what the hell--you like him anyway.

We also get a somewhat heartfelt performance out of Robert Englund as one of the nicer aliens and a chance to witness Englund's softer side-before Nightmare on Elm Street.

I was a little disappointed with the abruptness of the series end. You get the feeling you've just watched the open act of a play as the curtains are drawn shut. Whether the producers already had the second mini-series in production or if they were actually shooting for an ongoing series--I have no idea, but the only way to really know the story is to continue, which I actually may do--so the series couldn't have been that bad, right?

Or maybe I'm just a sucker for hot babes that turn into lizards. I seem to remember at least one of those.

This was followed by the all-too-short regular weekly series (also available on dvd) and V - The Final Battle.  And that's the order you want to watch them in - that way everything ties together and you aren't wondering what went on and why something in The Final Battle is happening.

The original though, is still the best.  ""Friendly"" aliens come to Earth in need of water (supposedly)and we find out they aren't what they seem and it makes for gripping viewing even if you've seen it before.  It even features a young Robert Englund (Freddy Kreuger in Nighmare On Elm Street 1- 102)as a ""good"" alien.

There are shades of Nazi Germany and the persecution of the Jews running rampant through the series - showing perhaps that what happened once can happen again and it doesn't have to be a madman who's responsible for the genocide taking place.

The V mythology developed the second category in important ways that impacted both kids and big people, too.  Without V would we have had Independence Day?  Or Men in Black?
V also made an impact overseas.  In September 1985 in Florence, I heard a street vendor who was fatigued with the surge of tourists sigh: ""Visitatori!""  His analogy was very well taken.
V-Fans hope for another sequel.  The projected ""V the Second Generation"" sounds a lot like Star Trek TNG.

Watching it as an adult made me better grasp the sophisticated subplots of duplicity, heroism, politics, war and prejudice.  I salute the grandfather character for his courage in standing up to authority.

This time around, I had more praises for Faye Grant's acting. She was a reluctant leader who grew into that role.

This is not a bad average for TV sci-fi. It is certainly better than the garbage that various networks  are producing now.

The movie is about aliens from another galaxy. They come in peace. On earth, when they arrive, they are known as the Visitors. The Visitors explain that their world is dying and they need Earth's help. Dressed in a red type of uniform with knee high boots (like what the motorcycle police boots) and dark thick sunglasses, the Visitors supreme commander, John played by Richard Herd, appeals to everyone on earth. They appeal to mans good will and are in desperate need of help. John explains that there world is much like Earth but is dying. Since they look like us, are they telling the truth? Are they hostile? Everyone goes about there lives but then people start to disappear. Doctors, scientists, anthropologists, archeologists and others who the Vistitors think will uncover there plan? But what is it? Hey, I'm not into spoiling it for those who haven't seen this movie. You'll have to watch it! :)

This movie stars Marc Singer (The Beastmaster) as Mike Donovan, a reporter, who makes startling discoveries on the mothership and soon the Visitors try to silence him...for good. Will he make it back to earth to warn anyone who will listen to him? Will he be turned in? Another good casting was Diana (Jane Badler who frequented the daytime soaps), the leader of the mothership who was excellent as the evil visitor hell bent on converting earthlings, using them for experements and getting what she wanted from Earth.  And who loved Martin as one of the few vistors who helped the resistance. Martin (Frank Ashmore from Airplane!) was a member of the 5th column who didn't believe in their Leaders true intentions for earth. In the first original series, you meet Martin and Barbara as they help Mike Donovan escape Diana's clutches.

The movie moves in a good pace. Slowly you see scientists disappearing, unexplained deaths, humans joining the Visitor youth group, and people writing with ""the wrong hand"" which raises some suspicions. This is a classic sci-fi movie, and since the movie is over twenty years old it comes with aged special effects but if you notice, the mother ships resemble the ones in Independence Day. However the ones in ID4 are much much bigger but you can see the slight similarities. Anyone who owns a sci-fi collection or love alien movies will not want to miss this one. It would of been nice to see some extras on how they did the makeup as well as deleted scenes. You do however, get a lengthy commentary by the directory/writer Kenneth Johnson. He talks about how the movie was made, the special effects, and breif chats with some of the stars. Marc Singer and Faye Grant share their expierences in the movie. Kenneth Johnson coincidently is in the process of making another made for TV movie V called V: The Second Generation.

Sci-fi buffs while the movie is very old, it is one of those DVD collections that people will pick up and say, "" Wow, I haven't seen this in a while,"" and watch it. If you like this one, pick up V: The Final Battle also. The 2 made for TV movies spawned a TV series but it didn't last long.

574813,4,6303101178,"Inspired by the novel ""It Can't Happen Here"" by Sinclair Lewis, the original mini-series ""V"" deals with a race of aliens who visit Earth with the promise of technology and cures for disease in exchange for our aid in producing a chemical needed on their planet.  But their true intent is to steal Earth's water, and people...for food.  Their peaceful facade slowly disolves to expose their facist mentality.  Scientists, who are viewed as a threat by the aliens for their potential to uncover the truth, are persecuted, not only by the aliens, but by the humans who follow the aliens like sheep (ironically).

The DVD also includes some behind-the-scenes footage, and an excellent audio commentary by creator Kenneth Johnson.  Johnson is able to provide commentary during the entire 196 minutes without it ever becoming dull or uninteresting -- in fact, it's one of the best audio commentary tracks I've ever heard.

Her performance, along with those of fellow 'lizards' Andrew Prine and Sarah Douglas, are the highlights of this, a compilation of both the original 1984 miniseries and its sequel.

  While Mark Singer and Faye Grant are passable as the two of the many 'heroes' in these films, the juiciest parts still belong to the bad guys or an anti-hero, in the form of Michael Ironside as 'Ham Tyler'. David Packer and Neva Patterson play 'Daniel' and 'Eleanor', respectively, humans that ally themselves with the invading 'friends'. The two obviously enjoyed portraying such disreputable characters.

Yes, I recorded it from broadcast TV years ago, and wore out those tapes, and, yes, I then purchased both ""V-The Miniseries"" and ""V-The Final Battle"" when I found them on VHS. I have since bought both of them in DVD format, and will definetely buy the whole series when it comes out this month on DVD.

 Many people were not aware that ""V-The Miniseries"" actually had a ""conclusion"" miniseries air a year later. While the original was awesome (with then-unheard-of special/make-up effects that totally outshone other shows/series of its time), I was very disappointed when it ended the way it did... Which is why I was thrilled when ""The Final Battle"" was later aired on TV. I also enjoyed the series that followed. However, although the series never captivated me as much as the previous miniseries did, I still will definetely add it to my DVD collection.

 Even many people who were not sci-fi fans enjoyed these miniseries, as there are some definite parallels between the aliens coming to Earth (and trying to defeat the humans in the manner they did) and the Holocaust (and the propoganda ""war"" and virtual enslavement of the Jewish community that the Nazi regime created). Although I do remember some people freaking out over the idea that something like that could happen in the ""present day"" (of course that's the early-80's).

 Overall, I highly recommend watching the entire thing (both ""V-The Miniseries"", and ""V-The Final Battle"") together, or else you miss so much. I have to admit that some of the acting lagged (although I really did like Michael Ironside's character), but the plot and the overall quality of the movie more than made up for it. Some people have complained that the DVD release is a ""fake widescreen"", in that they cut off the top and bottom of the film to make it that way, but if so, I didn't really notice it.

Look beyond all of that and you will find an engrossing story. A true underdog story that everyone will enjoy. Sure, ""V"" is basically a science fiction retelling of the Nazi takeover of Europe, but it is also much more.

The two mini-series were shot (and, importantly, broadcast) in fullscreen 4:3 mode. Warner Bros, apparently with Kenneth Johnson's blessing, have ""matted"" (i.e. covered up part of the top and bottom of the picture) to make this fit widescreen TVs.
Johnson claims he shot the first mini-series with a theatrical aspect ratio in mind (which doesn't explain why ""The Final Battle"" was also matted), but that's not the point: it was shot primarily for TV and therefore, should've been presented in its original 4:3 ratio.",1082937600,34,703,4.966101694915254

575009,5,6303101178,"I remember when I was 9 years old and started to see advertisements in the TV Guide for this miniseries.  At first it was just a very vague picture of a ""V"".  This was intriguing.  Week by week there would be little added catch lines like ""They're Coming"".  Then I saw the previews on television which were also rather mysterious.  This series unfolds very much like those ads.  For those of you who are confused, be aware this is the first mini-series.  V:  The Final Battle was the sequel mini-series which did not run until the following year.  In the opening scenes we meet the various human characters from all walks of life that we'll be following throughout the story.  Suddenly huge mother ships begin to appear over major cities all over the world.  Naturally, everyone is very scared and apprehensive.  What do they want?
When we finally meet the Visitors they appear human.  They assure the world that they have come in peace and that they need our help to save their dying planet.  Naturally, humans offer to help in any way they can.  As the story progresses, various characters begin to suspect the Visitors are not all they're cracked up to be.  And they're right!
Marc Singer plays the role of Mike Donovan, a rather arrogant journalist who catches on film just what the visitors truly look like.  Naturally, he becomes a target.  Mike also discovers that these beings are not here for the reasons they have told the world.  And they certainly haven't come in peace!
Juliet Parrish, played by Faye Grant, is a med student who becomes alarmed at the number of doctors and scientists who are inexplicably disappearing.  It doesn't take long to pinpoint who is causing their vanishing acts.  As a result she becomes a very capable, albeit reluctant, leader to a small group of people who plan to stop the Visitors.  As the group grows larger, so do her insecurities.  Mike becomes involved with the group and shares what he knows with Julie and the others, and they begin to plan how they will stop the aliens.
Meanwhile, more ambitious humans are like peas in a pod with the Visitors.  Refusing to believe that their intentions could be the least bit corrupt.  This series ends with several cliff-hangers, the most memorable being the fact that a human girl is now impregnated with an alien's child, the result of an experiment the alien Diana instigated.
The characters are very well written in this mini-series.  The parallels between the Visitors and the Nazis are very obvious but also compelling.  It shows how easily some people can be led, and how far some will go to gain power over others.
I do prefer The Final Battle over this initial series for the simple fact that there is more Diana!  Jane Badler plays, perhaps, the best TV villainess EVER and there is simply not enough of her in this first one.  Still, you can't see the second one without the first one!  But do yourself a favor and buy both this mini-series and the second one at the same time!  You won't want to wait to watch the second part simply because this one leaves you in suspense.  This series remains a ""must have"" in my personal collection.  I bought the videos when they first came out and before that I had generic taped copies that were darn near worn out from viewing!  A KEEPER!",1032652800,3,3280,4.617647058823529
575010,5,6303101178,"When Kenneth Johnson first pitched V to NBC and Warner Bros, he was greeted by yawns from the various execs because his pitch had more to do with the Nazis of WW2 and the French Resistance fighters than anything else, but then he dropped a bombshell:
""The difference is that these Nazis are from outer space.""
With these words, V: The Original Miniseries was born.  An epic tale of an alien race who supposedly came in peace, but who then proceeded to enslave the planet, V is more of a story about the human condition, about our own weaknesses, than a flashy sci-fi tale.  Even though most of the Visitors believe in their Great Leader's plans to steal the water from Earth and use humans for cannon fodder and food, there is a small contingent of Visitor officers such as Martin and Barbara who are firmly convinced that what their superiors are doing is wrong and proceed to help the Human Resistance movement in any way they can.  There are also Visitors like Brian, who serves as sort of a recruiting officer for the Visitors Friends, an organization of young humans who are dedicated to helping the Visitors to maintain order after several alleged attacks on Visitor refineries and processing plants (Brian is also the officer approached by Diana to participate in a medical experiment that leads to the impregnation of Robin Maxwell, the daughter of one of the Resistance fighters, Robert Maxwell).
I have to say that getting V: The Original Miniseries on DVD at last proved to be quite a plus for me, because I had worn out various VHS copies thanks to multiple viewings.  The story is that good!  I was also glad to get to see the Making Of documentary, which contains comments from various cast and crew including Kenneth Johnson, Marc Singer, and Faye Grant (wife of 7th Heaven's Stephen Collins).

575014,5,6303101178,"As a 13 year old kid in 1983, the original V miniseries was huge; it seems like all of my friends watched it and talked about it.  Certain memories of this small screen epic have stayed with me for many years, and I was overjoyed when the miniseries was released on VHS.  What kid could forget the images of the giant motherships hovering above our major cities, the first glimpse at the true, reptilian faces of the visitors underneath their human masks, and--above all else--the horrible yet incredibly cool sight of watching the visitors eating live rats and other small creatures?  This really was a landmark event in television and science fiction; if my memory serves me, this was actually one of television's very first miniseries and did much to lay the groundwork for future successes in the genre.  V no longer packs quite the punch it did in 1983, especially in terms of special effects, but its classic status does nothing to lessen its impact.
The story is rather simple.  A fleet of giant alien motherships appears out of nowhere to hover over the world's major cities.  When communication is established, the aliens announce they come in peace and want to share their knowledge with Earth in exchange for assistance in producing chemicals needed on their home planet in the Sirius system.  Reporter Christine Walsh soon becomes the spokesperson for the Visitors, but her colleague Mike Donovan becomes suspicious when charges of a vast conspiracy of scientists against the Visitors is announced.  He manages to sneak on board a mothership and obtains visual evidence of the true natures of Earth's so-called friends.  When he tries to present this evidence, the Visitors take control of all the networks and announce the fact they are going to work in conjunction with the government in order to maintain law and order.  Having established martial law, the Visitors begin taking large numbers of people away, especially scientists.  L.A.'s remaining scientists start a Resistance movement to protect themselves and to work to thwart the aliens' intentions, eventually incorporating Donovan in their ranks.  The second half of the miniseries deals with the Resistance and the stepped-up efforts of the Visitors to destroy it.  There are many characters and many subplots thrown into the mix.  Comparisons to the Holocaust are both obvious and explicit, represented powerfully and eloquently by a Jewish survivor of a Nazi concentration camp.  A crucial plot point in terms of setting the stage for the follow-up miniseries revolves an anthropologist's teenaged daughter who is smitten with one of the young Visitors; Diana, the second in command and most attractive Visitor, arranges for a biological ""experiment"" between the human girl and her alien friend.
Marc Singer (better known as that guy you recognize in other stuff but cannot remember where you've seen him before) stars as Donovan.  Faye Grant is the reluctant leader of the band of resisting scientists; her balancing act between victim and revolutionary gets a little sappy at times, but overall she plays her part well.  Jane Badler is wonderful as the beautifully devious alien Diana.  Robert, Englund (yes, Freddy Krueger himself) is quite funny as a clumsy, bumbling alien who has yet to learn the nuances of the English language (you see, he learned Arabic for his mission, but a screwup led to him being assigned to Los Angeles instead of the Persian Gulf area).  Leonardo Cimino as Abraham serves as the moral voice of the Resistance effort and clarifies the point that V stands for victory.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is only the original miniseries, and, as Faye Grant's character says, the war is just beginning.  Resolution and a sense of completion are to be found only in the V: The Final Battle miniseries.",1025740800,3,3811,5.007923930269413
575015,1,6303101178,I was very disappointed in the DVD V.

Am I missing something here? is there a second DVD with this ending and the missing scenes? Or did they just cut a hell of a lot out to fit it all on one DVD???,1025740800,3,345,3.8732394366197185
575016,5,6303101178,"V was one of those series - like many - that start off real strong and then forget about characters and story and replace them with action and budget cuts. This is the first of two mini series and then a short-lived series. This movie had some great concepts and parallels to human history. From the Nazi's to Mad Scientists - everything seemed cohesive and entertaining.
This movie has some great performances by Marc Singer, Faye Grant and even Freddie Kruger himself - Robert England. You have Michael Ironside as a bad guy tuned good guy and how can you forget the ever-evil performance by the bad lady herself Jane Badler. She really was fun to hate and played it to the top! Then there is Richard Herd - the leader of the Alien race. He was very starchy at first but then you got to know who he really wasn't.
The story is simple. It's ET taken the next step. Not only are we contacted by Aliens (Or Visitors - hence the ""V"" in the title) but also they are asked to stay and help our natural resources. But guess what? They need something in return. Food. Guess what the food source it? I'll never tell.
Anyway, I think young and old alike will enjoy this and without the commercials and having to watch it over three nights it is very very good. The DVD extras are good to and especially the commentary. It was interesting hearing how it was produced in the late 80's. You like Sci-Fi you'll like this!",1025654400,,1409,4.3816793893129775

NOW FOR MY REAL REASON OF WRITING A NEW REVIEW:
Okay, I don't see why everyone is complaining about ""false advertising"". It says on the case, and on [this items detail] page, ""THE ORIGINAL MINISERIES"". That's exactly what you get, the original miniseries and not the FINAL BATTLE MINISERIES. They are two separate miniseries' people, released over a year apart!!!
So read the case before you buy it. It DOES SAY 197 minutes, not 463 minutes or however long the whole batch runs. So, people, don't listen to those who say there is false advertising; they didn't take the time to check out the FACTS before they bought this. The FINAL BATTLE MINISERIES is coming to DVD in August 2002.
Secondly, this is widescreen, not cropped. They filmed it in widescreen for release in the UK (which never happened) and then aired it on TV at a 1.33:1 ratio. This new 1.85:1 ratio adds more to the sides and hardly anything is missing from the top and bottom. I have compared to my old VHS and found this to be 100% true.",1025481600,6,1088,4.527918781725888

I have also seen someone saying that this show was made widescreen by cutting off the top and bottom of the original.  I have not compaired, but I do not think that this is the case.  From my understanding, this show was filmed in widescreen then edited for the television screen.  I guess that I'll have to check it out.
As for the show, I loved it.  I even liked the sequels which were done is a somewhat more action oriented vein, instead of the more inteligent way the original was.  Willie was always my favorite character and I had never even heard of Robert Englund before this.  Hell, he hadn't really done anything big before this.  The special effects are really amazing if you take into account the technology available and the limited budget that they were working with.  The DVD has some pretty good special features, though there could have been more.  The transfer is pretty good quality too.
For any science fiction fans - I would recommend this film!

575124,5,6303101178,"""V"" was one of most original made for television movies of its time. It spawned a sequel and its very own television series. It was able to do this with a cast of virtual unknowns, because of the strength of its story line. ""V"" is simply great sci-fi.
The film opens with fify gigantic spaceships, hovering over all of Earth's major cities (Independance Day, anyone?), while mankind anxiously awaits the outcome of their mysterious, awe inspiring presence. What transpires is almost anti-climactic, for when the visitors finally emerge from their spaceships, they look human. They are led by an alien innocuosly called John (Richard Herd), who gives Earth a benevolent message. They come in peace, or so everyone is led to believe. Many are gulled, and some humans even end up working collaboratively for the aliens. There are some, however, that are skeptical of the aliens' motives, and mistrust turns to fear when scientists and doctors begin to be rounded up and mysteriously disappear.
Mike Donovan (Marc Singer), a hunky cameraman, has his own misgivngs about the aliens, but when he observes the aliens literally shedding their skins, revealing that that they are not human at all, but rather nothing more than reptilian looking aliens, his misgivings are reinforced. Mike also discovers that they mean mankind harm and are hellbent of the conquest of Earth and divestiture of one of Earth's most important natural resources without which humans cannot live.
Mike now joins the resistance, headed by beautiful medical doctor, Julie Parish (Faye Grant). As the underground resistance battles the aliens, many humans are still convinced that the aliens good and are being misjudged by these so called freedom fighters. As facist rule supplants democratic government throughout the world, under the pretext of law and order and at the direction of the aliens and behest of their human puppets, the viewer cannot help but be aware of the allegorical implications. In case the viewer should be so obtuse as to miss it, Abraham Bernstein (Leonardo Cimino), a holocaust survivor, blatantly states it.
There are some interesting special effects for its time. There are also some key performances. Most notable is that of Jane Badler in the role of the evil, but exquisitely beautiful alien, Diana, the alien science officer and the one from whom humans have much to fear. Look also for then newcomer, Robert Englund, of later Freddy Kreuger fame, in the role of Willie, a peaceful loving alien who allies himself with the resistance. This film has everything: suspense, action, thrills, unusal special effects, a great story line, a moral message, and an inter-species romance. How can anyone resist? Kudos to writer/director Kenneth Johnson. This is sci-fi as it should be. Bravo!
The DVD provides a crystal clear picture and audio, as well as an excellent feature length commentary by writer/director Kenneth Johnson. There is also a behind the scenes documentary that is well worth watching. The DVD provides the usual interactive menus, as well as scene access, and may be viewed in English and French.

""V,"" the NBC Television mini-series which first aired nearly two decades ago, was intended to be seen for its entertainment value though, admittedly, using some pre-mid 20th century historical elements to contribute to the overall plot and theme of the story -- specifically World War II Germany (the alien ""national symbol"" even resembling an incompleted 'connect-the-dots' swastika). Little did the writers, directors and producers of this mini-series realize that their sci-fi project was a late 20th century prophecy which would begin seeing fulfillment in the just few months shy of the dawning years of the 21st century.

The purchase of this DVD marked the very first time of my ever seeing this feature, and I was instantly hooked, especially by its dazzling high-octane opening sequence. The special effects were also nicely done considering the time period in which it was made, that it was a ""made for television"" movie, and the fact that it was made on the cheap. (It was also nice to see Robert Englund as something other than a flame-scarred tragedy figure.)

The story of ""V"" revolves around a race of seemingly benevolent space aliens who look, sound and act a lot like us. They convince the world that they are our friends and only wish to extend the hand of cooperation & unity and work toward a ""common good"" where all will benefit. But there are those who have some very gnawing suspicions about the ""Visitors,"" that they are not quite everything they appear to be -- which is a serious understatement, for it turns out that the real agenda of the ""Visitors"" is to rape the planet of its most precious resources and enslave humanity.

""V's"" creators obviously tried to parallel the story with National Socialist Germany, but in hindsight it becomes frighteningly obvious that ""V"" was as much a vision of the ""historical future"" as it was a view to the ""historical past!"" That unintentionally forseen future sneaked up on us and, just like in the mini-series, nobody took notice... until it was too late! That ""future"" which ""V"" foreshadowed occured during the ""Campaign 2000"" (""C2K"") presidential [s]election! The similarities are too hauntingly similar:

> ""V"": ""Visitors"" came as ""friends"" promoting ""brotherhood"" and prosperity for all.
> ""C2K"": Republican nominee presented himself as a ""compassionate uniter"" who promised a strong, vibrant economy.

> ""V"": ""Visitors"" took control without being duly elected and under suspicious circumstances.
> ""C2K"": Republican presidential administration took control without being duly elected and under suspicious circumstances.

> ""V"": In order to usurp power, ""Visitors"" took advantage of impotent elected government officials.
> ""C2K"": In order to usurp power, Republicans took advantage of impotent elected Democrat government officials & politicians.

> ""V"": ""Visitors"" fabricated a non-existent energy crisis on their homeworld in order to plunder & exploit the precious natural resourses of earth.
> ""C2K"": Republicans fabricated a non-existent energy crisis in our homeland (in California specifically and in the whole of the United States in general) in order to plunder & exploit the precious natural resourses of the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.

> ""V"": Major news media almost unilaterally gave supportive non-critical ""pro-Visitor"" spin to the news and did all they could to suppress independent media outlets and put a halt to, or discredit, any serious investigative news reporting.
> ""C2K"": Major news media almost unilaterally gave supportive non-critical ""pro-Bush"" spin to the news and did all they could to suppress independent media outlets and put a halt to, or discredit, any serious investigative news reporting.

> ""V"": Scientists were demonized by ""Visitors"" as unwholesome, unpatriotic, and even dangerous elements of society.
> ""C2K"": Environmentalists, corporate regulation advocates, and civil rights advocacy groups were demonized by Republicans as unwholesome, unpatriotic, and even dangerous elements of society.

> ""V"": ""Visitors"" preached peace and tolerance while instigating a very one-sided ""endless war on terrorism,"" resulting in the repeal of certain rights guaranteed under Constitution-- including and especially 'free speech' --and labelling anyone critical of their unconstitutional actions as having sided with terrorists.
> ""C2K"": The Bush Administration preached peace and tolerance while instigating a very one-sided ""endless war on terrorism,"" resulting in the repeal of certain rights guaranteed under Constitution-- including and especially 'free speech' --and labelling anyone critical of their unconstitutional actions as having sided with terrorists.

> ""V"": ""Visitors"" operated a 'secret government' from a base on their homeworld.
> ""C2K"": The Bush Administration established a secret government in an undisclosed location here in our homeland.

> ""V"": ""Visitors"" advocated a policy encouraging citizens to spy upon one another and report ""anything suspicious"" that could be construed as being linked to terrorism or terrorist organizations.
> ""C2K"": The Bush Administration advocated a policy called ""Operation TIPS"" (""Terrorism Information and Prevention System"") which encourages citizens to spy upon one another and report ""anything suspicious"" that could be construed as being linked to terrorism or terrorist organizations.

It goes on and on! Where does one stop with all of the comparisons? The similarities are virtually endless! The only thing missing is a distinctive insignia to rally behind (that is, of course, if one doesn't already consider the American Flag to be it, especially since the unfortunate tragedy of ""911""), designer costumes for the ""Youth Brigades,"" and entire sweeps of towns and mass imprisonments.

In ""V"" the violators of our basic and most cherished liberties were lizard-creatures wearing human-looking skin; In 21st century America they are human through-and-through, but they do often speak with the 'forked tongue' of a reptile!

The makers of this mini-series probably had no idea they were developing a  story with an eye on a direct future outcome, which makes this series even more enjoyable and even more disturbing to watch. Everyone should watch this video, not only for the entertainment value, but also as a warning and a wake-up call!

[Dialogue from the film]:
(Mike Donovan): ""How did someone like that get to be your leader anyway?""
(""Martin""): ""Charisma. Circumstances, promises. Not enough of us spoke out to question him until it was too late.""

When it arrived I watched it with my boyfriend and was disappionted to see how the DVD ended and wondered what has happened to the rest of the story. I remember Robin having alien twins but on the DVD mini sereies it ends before she gives birth. is there a second part coming out on DVD or what? what is going on if anyone has an answer please email me at tammyanne@btopenworld.com,1020556800,,526,4.116504854368932

So I checked it side by side with my old tape recorded off the air, and the way they made this into widescreen is to crop off the top and the bottom of the screen!  This is inexcusable!

I felt that the advertising on the cover was misleading as i thought it contained the full original Mini -Series, including The Final Battle.

Much of the concept, and the first half hour of plot, is straight out of Arthur C. Clarke's classic novel Childhood's End.  At least they gave him credit by mentioning him in a newscast.  I think it's great they could introduce this classic story to the masses.
It soon departs from Clarke's story, however, and weaves its own.  They clearly wanted to cover socially relevant themes, such as teen pregnancy and the Holocaust.  They also threw in a little soap opera bickering.  Mix it all together with a few great second-rate actors (what would a bad movie be without Michael Ironside?) and what have you got?

I am now watching the DVD of ""V,"" which I first saw as a nine-year-old girl way back when. Back when ""V"" was originally aired, everyone I knew was floored, awed, and immediately ""converted"" by this very, very good story about an alien race infiltrating our lives and what the ones who don't like it do about it.
This is a very, very great mini-series presented in movie format almost 20 years later. If you liked it when it first aired then this DVD is a must-see. Unfortunately, the DVD could have included the entire second mini-series and a ton more features than it does have (such as being able to choose Dolby Surround instead of being stuck with 5.1, which doesn't sound quite right when one doesn't have a 5.1-capable sound card in their computer). This is why I only gave four stars instead of five, considering that the whole movie deserves about eight stars.
However, considering the rare quality of what amounts to a two-part made-for-TV movie (the story, the music, the acting, and the extraordinary special effects for the time period and format), buying this DVD is money well spent, for science fiction freaks as well as those who just like a great,...movie.",1016409600,,1236,4.726851851851852

Almost twenty years later, the movie still holds up rather well. There are a few anachronistic moments (Space Invaders video games, 80's baseball Dodger references, cordless telephones that look like Army radios), but none of those take away from the emotional depth of the piece. V is more than just a classic sci-fi film. It's about fighting injustice and intolerance and standing up for what's right. Of course, if those big issues don't interest you much, you can still watch the movie and see how it has impacted recent trends in movies (watch when the mother ships arrive; INDEPENDENCE DAY ripped a lot off of V).

To sum it up, this movie was awesome on so many levels.
 Whereas I was expecting your typical alien invasion movie, V gave me The Diary of Anne Frank, Schindler's List, and Independance day all rolled into one.
 Without giving too much of the plot away, let me at least say that I had favorite characters among both the humans and the Visitors (Willie and Harmony were my favorites) and I liked the way the movie portrayed both sides as having emotional and personal depth. As I said, I could never explain all the reasons I liked this mini-series in the thousand word allotment given, so all I can tell you is: The DVD is worth it.",1012521600,3,909,4.536585365853658

575326,5,6303101178,"This is a great movie. The production was well done and the movie still holds up well to modern audiences. But what intrigues me is the way the movie created tension. You have a full 15 minutes of different scenes in different locations before you even see the visitors arrive. It's a lot longer before you even see them. It's a great way to build suspense and also suspicion. You didn't even know the ""terrible secret"" till you're well into the movie.
The weaknesses of this movie are relatively small. They overplay the gullability of people a bit and some of the special effects are not all that great. But the character building and general drama of the movie is not lost and the actors succeed often in developing their characters.
You can also see the wisdom of the producers in anticipating a sequel with lots of ""unexplained events"" towards the end. It would beg for a sequel.
The DVD also contains a featurette on the making of V. It's OK. Very grainy and not well produced. But it's interesting to see some of the backside of moviemaking.",1012262400,,1048,4.579787234042553

The second series is called ""The Final Battle"". As the movie is an allegory about faschism, the open ending isn't really that important as it points out the message ""The war will be long, but we are eager to win!""

575329,4,6303101178,"As one of the most fanatical ""V"" fans to be found in the early 80's, I couldn't quite give this DVD release the 5 stars that I so desperately wanted to.  As an allegorical ""it certainly CAN happen here"" tale, V is unparalleled.  As a science-fiction tale it's merely okay --and as for the cheesy comic book-level TV series it spawned, well, the less said about that the better.
Probably the best feature of the DVD is the commentary by Kenneth Johnson, but for me, it only brought home the tragedy of what this truly excellent pilot degenerated into.  The original ""V"" isn't so much about an alien invasion as much as it is about us as a civilization and how human beings react to dramatic changes in the norm.  Once the shock of extraterrestrial contact (in the form of ""Independence Day""-style ships over the world's major cities) wears off, it's astonishing how quickly the Visitors are welcomed into almost every facet of human culture, and how difficult it is for so many members of the cast to accept ""the truth"" as inadvertently discovered by Marc Singer's character.

There must be at least 30 principal characters to keep track of, but for me that's what brings this series down to earth --it's the best way to showcase how world events affect ""the ordinary guy.""  Visuals are impressive by 1983 standards  --again, mainly because of how ordinary they're made to look (for example, alien shuttlecraft take off and land at a manufacturing refinery and rate about as much notice by passerby as, say, a tractor trailer).  <pause>  Okay, to be fair, there's some truly scary makeup effects and a great edge-of-your-seat spaceship chase sequence at the end.
All told, whether you're a devotee of the TV series, a Jane Badler fan (hubba hubba), or a student of the Nazi ""phenomenon"" of the 1930's, this chapter is worth spending your money on, but ONLY this one.  Skip ""The Final Battle"" sequel and certainly avoid that demeaning ""L.A. is the Center of the Universe"" TV series.",1009324800,4,1980,4.746355685131196

Who says that they'll sell a ""complete set"" when they digitize V The Final Battle into a DVD?

I've seen some very interesting comments and i'd like to comment on one of them. I noticed that someone said that this movie was not dolby surround. They even went as far as saying that it is mono. This movie IS Dolby Surround and it is NOT mono. Dolby digital and Dolby surround are 2 different things. While this movie may NOT be Dolby Digital, it certainly IS Dolby Surround sound. The best way you can enjoy Dolby Surround today is by using a Dolby Pro-logic 2 home theater recever. Dolby pro-logic 2 takes Dolby Surround and turns it into 5.1 channel sound to create an experience very similar to dolby digital or dts.

575403,4,6303101178,"Prior to its initial release on NBC back in '83 a marketing campaign caught my attention.  Large posters were appearing around the Los Angeles area with friendly looking figures dressed in all red wearing sunglasses espousing friendship.  Little did I know I was being sucked into this epic miniseries some 18 years ago.
I was elated to discover that the original installment of 'V' was to be released on DVD, and it still delivers its message and powerful story all these years later.
To sum up the story briefly: How would the general populace react and adjust to a 'friendly' introduction of an alien species?  Aliens that appear to look just like us, have many of the same mannerisms and personalities of our families and friends.  If not for their slightly off-key voice, sensitivity to bright light (hence the sun-glasses the Visitors wear) and city size motherships hanging over our most developed world cities how would we feel about peaceful co-existence with a race from beyond the stars who appear to be  seeking our help.
And then things begin to change.  Subtle at first, like the registering of scientists, then the tracking of phone calls.  Soon, through alien propaganda and blind human power mongers and greedy egos the situation became worst: Martial law became initialized, certain foods were becoming scarce, neighbors and family members became suspicious of each other and started to disappear.  Then finally our worst fears are realized:  While we were befriending these so called peaceful aliens we discover they have an ulterior motive after integrating themselves into our society.  They need water and plan to strip it from the Earth, they need live food in the shape of humans, and need cannon fodder to fight other galactic battles and these soldiers come in the form of humans.  And most shockingly is that underneath their human appearance, they are actually reptilian with snake like eyes and a forked tongue.
There is a lot of parallels between 'V' and that of Hitler through his rise to power through propaganda, and finally showing his true colors by committing genocide and war.  What is educational about this science fiction story is that you begin to understand how we as humans can easily have the wool pulled over our eyes, turn on our family, and miss the big picture completely.
The DVD itself is two sided with re-mastered sound and cleaned up prints.  Looks as good today as it did in 1983.  While some dialogue could be considered hokey, the overall story is great with many developing sub-plots that unfold to a big surprise of the Visitors true intentions after 3.5 hours of viewing.
The greatest feature of this DVD is the writer/directors commentary audio track.  There is sooo much information he talks about on how shots were set up, props and locations used, lighting and special effects techniques, camera angles and direction, and Easter eggs buried within the series its mind-boggling.  After watching it with this alternate audio track, it's like watching it for the first time again.  Simply great, imaginative, informative, and puts your smile on a face about Hollywood magic from the early 80's.
Also included was a 'behind the scenes/making of' type of documentary that was also good.
Just hope they eventually make part 2:  'V' The Final Battle to help complete this series, as the end of this disc is somewhat of a cliffhanger just as I remembered it as a child.",1000252800,4,3424,4.925217391304348

575506,4,6303101178,"When i first saw this in 1983 on NBC and then ""Return of the Jedi"" 4 weeks later on the big screen i didn't know which one i liked better, V definately plays on our greatest fears, as saucer ships hover over earth's major cities we soon learn that they are on a peace mission, but they have a secret agenda and that is where the fun begins, i have always liked this film for its imagination, everyone gives their best performances in this film, but when compared to ""Independence Day"" logic sets in, would aliens with the intent of taking over earth create such a deception to gain our trust so they could carry out their evil deeds or would they cut to the chase and take us out, it seems that the latter would be more real, but this one stands out for its character development, Marc Singer is perfect as Mike Donovan, a news cameraman who worst suspision is proven true, making him & others like him a threat to the Visitor's agenda, all walks of life come together here with Faye Grant as Julie Parrish, a med student, & Michael Durrell as Robert, a scientist, who join together to expose the Visitors for their real intensions which are more apparent with its follow-up a year later in 1984's ""The Final Battle"", whereas ID4 is more special effects driven, this one is more character driven, I don't know which one I like better, there is really no comparison, if you really like Sci-Fi!!",998352000,,1393,4.4453125

Even though the effects have been long since surpassed - the storyline holds up even today.  What would happen if we were slowly invaded by a fascist state?  How would people react?  Ken Johnson explores the characters just as much as his chilling sci-fi theme.  The DVD offers for the first time in WIDESCREEN the first two acts of what would become a five episode miniseries.

575509,3,6303101178,"V is an excellent sci-fi story. Alien visitors come to Earth in peace, only in truth they want our water and our people. It starts out with 50 spaceships appearing all over Earth. Their supreme commander offers peace. They say they need our help. They need to use our factorys/plants to produce a synthetic chemical necessary for their survival. Marc Singer plays a cameraman chosen to be on the first tour of a mothership. The visitors are welcoming and everything appears fine. Later, he sneaks back aboard and finds out that the visitors are reptiles, and are destroying their chemical. The visitors are in control of everything, conditioning important people, turning all scientists into lying criminals, in complete control of the media. Singer's evidence goes unseen and he is marked a fugitive. Meanwhile, others are realizing the truth about the visitors. Resistance cells began to grow. Donavon (Marc Singer) is captured by the visitors, along with his partner. The second-in-command alien, Diana plans to kill him. Her chief Lieutenant, Martin, persuades her to brainwash him instead. Saved from death, Martin tells him that he is part of a resistance inside the visitor fleet. Martin tells him of the real reason they are here, to stockpile people and water. Donavon gets back to find his son's town completely gone, except for one boy who tells that the towns people were taken by the visitors. Donavon joins one of the resistance cells, and they fight off an attack on their mountain camp. The visitors learned of this camp by one of the fugitive scientists, they held his daughter captive. This daughter is impregnated by one of the aliens. The movie ends with the resistance sending signals into space, hoping to find allies against the visitors. It ends with the resistance's leader and her friends spraying ""V"" for victory in a doorway. If you haven't seen it you should, it is a good story with a lot going on.

My family--the youngest being 11 years old--was fascinated with how stilted the dialogue was, how unrealistically stupidly the humans' reacteds were, and how weak was the overall emotional impact.
Maybe in the 80's it had impact because the 80's were such a wasteland entertainment-wise, and re-watching this series engenders sentimental feelings for those who had nothing better back then. Maybe because we had never seen it before and have been spoiled by truly inspirational tales such as Independence Day, and excellent acting and writing found in the X-Files. I don't know how to explain it, but I can't imagine that anyone would highly recommend this movie. I say watch it only to experience how bad television can be.",996364800,5,875,4.879194630872483

575513,4,6303101178,"I saw this mini-series in its first run on NBC. My mom still has the video tapes we made of it, but we might as well get rid of them now that the DVD has been released. The first thing to mention is how well the characters, story and acting have held up over the years. This was good in '83, and it's good today. The video is sharp and clear, it's letterboxed because it was shot in wide screen, and I think that adds a lot, especially since the thing flows together nicely without commercials. The audio is good, however I seem to remember that the alien ships sounded more menancing when they moved. The special effects? Well, they were good for television in '83. Today, not so much.
Another thing to mention is Kenneth Johnson's commentary. Kenneth has a lot of experience working in television and you you get a big sense from the commentary how all of that helped make V a success. The opening shot of the rebel camp, with many stunts and helicopter fly-bys was filmed in 2 and a half days. From the time they got the go ahead to do the project to the time the cameras rolled was something like 2 weeks. Impressive.
I can't give the whole package 5 stars, however, since I feel there could have been more extras. A professinally done making of would have been very nice.  What we do see is a set of contemporary interviews (very grainy) with the major stars and some film of several shots being set up and filmed. It's nice to see, but something more current and professional is desired.
However that's not much to complain about since the movie itself is so nice to see again.",995760000,3,1583,4.366101694915254

575515,5,6303101178,"Movie Summary:  Out of nowhere, fifty gigantic spaceships appear above the major cities of the earth and we know that we are not alone in the universe. There is much nervousness as we wait for something to happen. Finally there is contact from the ships, they are here in peace to ask for help from us. They need a chemical that they can easily create here on earth. They need the chemical to save their dying planet. In exchange they will share their technology with us. When they appear from their ships, they look surprising like us. They need sunglasses to protect their eyes and their voices sound weird, but other than that they are the same; or are they? Relations with the Visitors start out very well but very quickly turn bad. The Visitors have to help the governments of earth maintain peace; or do they?
My Opinion:  I loved V in 1983 when it played on television as a  miniseries. It was a huge event for a teenage science fiction fan. I was worried that it wouldn't hold up today so many years later. I watched the DVD and wasn't disappointed at all. The story was still as great as I remembered. A few of the special effects were dated by today's standards but most were not. With good science fiction it is the story that drives the movie, not the special effects. It is this way with V. The huge cast of characters and multiple plot lines make for a terrific story. The parallels to the Nazis are frightening. There are characters to care about; both to love and to hate. There is depth to this story and that is what makes it great. Mark Singer and Faye Grant are still two of my favorites. Do not miss this DVD not matter if you've seen it before or not. This is a great one.
DVD Quality:  1.85 Widescreen Anamorphic! This is awesome after seeing it in only 1.33:1 for all those years. DD2.0 Extras include commentary and Making of documentary. This is a flipper DVD with half of the feature on each side of the DVD. The picture quality is great. I was really impressed. The sound isn't great but isn't terrible either. Overall this DVD is a great value for the price.
What You Should Do:  If you are any kind of SciFi fan you need to get this DVD. The story holds up well and you will not be disappointed.

I was in shock after it came to an end, wondering where the rest of the adventure was, where the child that Robin is carrying was, and the fact that they end this DVD at ""Just the beginning"" in itself flipped my lid. So my question is, where and how can I get the rest of the series in DVD format. Will it be out soon? I sure hope so.
Why they decided to release like this instead of as the VHS did with the full miniseries is beyond me.

575657,5,6303101178,"'V'
---
Kenneth Johnson's superb 1983 mini-series might have dated visually, but this is easily overshadowed by the power of his writing and direction. 'V' is perhaps as fine an example of an alien invasion/conspiracy theory you will ever see, never equalled by The X-Files or the risible Independence Day (please compare the opening arrival sequences of these two films - this is no homage, ID4 is simply an inferior rip-off).
--
Populated by dozens of characters - the film has in excess of 90 speaking parts - this story centres, initially, around a young medical student called Julie Parrish (Faye Grant). It is through her that other characters come together to ally against the invading 'Visitors'. These characters cross all colour, class and religious lines to unite against the fascist, genocidal alien regime. The analogies to McCarthyism (with the witch-hunts for the Conspiracy of Scientists) and facism/Nazism are drawn sharply and early on.
--
Despite the immense scale of the project, 'V' has its strongest moments when the visual effects are absent, when the aliens are not on screen. Of course, the excitement rests in the suspense and secrecy that pervade the Resistance's fight with the aliens, sequences embellished with visual and make-up FX, but the true heart of this film resides firmly within its characters. It is through their losses and their triumphs that Johnson shows us that, at some point in our lives, we won't get by without the help of others, without sticking together, everyone included. The key scene in the film, which Johnson also wrote, is when the Bernstein's fight over allowing the Maxwell's to take refuge in their home. The re-telling of an old concentration camp story and, later, the reading of a letter reminds us that what is taking place here has gone before, and perhaps if we remember that then we might prevent it from happening again.
--
Let down occasionally by some poor FX (but also displaying some very impressive FX sequences), 'V' retains its original impact, perhaps more so now when compared with the juvenilised Hollywood movies which fail to achieve the standards of allegorical storytelling seen here. A truly wonderful film, let down by the space opera 'V - The Final Battle' the following year (which Johnson removed himself from early on), and the ludicrous TV series that ran from 1985-6. Forget them. You don't need 'The Final Battle', because if you pay attention, you'll know where this one is going.
--
NOTE: Warners have not included the original footage of Dominique Dunne in the scenes she shot as Robin Maxwell before she was murdered (4 Nov 1982). This is sad, as I have viewed one of these scenes myself - the scene in the mountain camp after Kathleen is killed - and thought other viewers would appreciate both seeing Dominique Dunne's final scenes and being able to compare them with the reshot scenes with Blair Tefkin (they're remarkably similar given the problems invloved in reshoots etc). However, I do recommend that viewers watch the film with the commentary by Kenneth Johnson. It's fantastic; not the most entertaining but by far the most informative commentary I've heard on a DVD yet. Johnson obviously went back to his notes and wrote an outline for this, so detailed are his anecotes. Excellent.",994032000,2,3291,4.974591651542649
