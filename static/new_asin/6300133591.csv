7803079,5,6300133591,Criterion should re-release this.  Incredible film.,1448409600,,51,7.5
7803080,5,6300133591,"I intended to comment on other reviews of this incredible movie but decided to include my comments in my own review because there's a layer of meaning and context that previous reviewers haven't mentioned. That Greek gods and goddesses have been recognized to be energy filled personality patterns that are lived in modern lives is known to some  but not generally known. This is a good time to try to write about them, from an experience with them.

I grew up hearing about a mid life crisis in females, a 'change of life'. It wasn't until about the time this movie was made that I read in a chapter in a book that males go through a change of life too. I could have recognized it in the movie Ash Wednesday, which is a textbook acted out by Elizabeth Taylor and Henry Fonda, on the male menopause. Elizabeth Taylor went through surgery to restore her body but that wasn't enough to save her marriage. Somehow movies didn't have the same impact then that they do now.

When Jason attempts to rationalize his decision to take a young bride, he tells Medea she doesn't understand why he's marrying this younger woman. It's for good reason: to benefit Medea and their sons, to assure their future and hers. Well, that does make sense in his context but there is the other context too, the obvious one, she's aging. His rationalizing and his logic grieved her to a degree that no literary heroine has 'felt' until Edward Cullen left Bella Swan almost immobilized in New Moon, the second book of the Twilight series.

A lot has changed since Medea was written, much more has changed in the 3+ decades since the movie was released. The words spoken in the film, (I'm not sure they are quotes from the original drama) by the ancient Medea about the role of a woman in life, in her husbands life were more than just words only when they 'resonated' within my own heart-soul. The dialogue sounds like Jason is as agonized in his grief at the loss of his sons as Medea was at the loss of her marriage and the life she believed she owned.

In the past movies were pure fiction to me and I suspect many like me, not only females but males too. I'm beginning to understand 'art' in a way I didn't in 1978. Certain ideas and words have an energy that continues to re-sound, echoing forwards through time, and this movie is close to being a perfect text book about such complexes, energized patterns and how they are active now, in the lives of individuals who do not suspect what drives are at work.

It was only when I was at mid-life myself that it was possible, even necessary to begin to see into how big a blind spot existed between males concept of themselves and the female experience of 'him'. In our 'now' the male experience of 'her', the textbooks to read are real life and in understanding the 'arts' of our time, in my opinion. This movie should be at least released on DVD. My VHS copy has hisses in the audio but I listen through them. There are few VHS copies offered on the Internet.

It is a mystery to me why A Dream of Passion is not on DVD and perhaps studied seriously. Fiction used to be thought to be an escape from reality to many people but now its closer to being an escape into real reality",1349136000,2,3205,4.412859560067682
7803081,5,6300133591,"This is another case when other reviewers have covered (quite well, I thought) the nuts & bolts of A DREAM OF PASSION.

I am commenting on pretty clear memories when I saw it while at University back in 19 blank blank. It is all the wonderful things the reviewers say. If I were still collecting movies, I would pay the going price even for VHS--it's that good. Mercouri took on this film after completing a series of outdoor performances of the original, classic MEDEA by Euripides. She won all kinds of accolades for an almost ""channeled"" portrayal of the scorned sorceress who sacrifices her children out of...what? hate, revenge, a twisted sense of justice?

As a prologue to A DREAM OF PASSION, you get to see Mercouri's Medea in all its awesomeness. Even today I'd snap the stage version right up if it were available. In terms of a DREAM OF PASSION, it was quite a gamble to have MM's staged Medea open the show so to speak--how can you top that? I remember the audience didn't expect that at all & people sort of sat there looking at the screen stunned by what they were witnessing. You wanted to applaud before the movie really even began. Hard to top--yes--but Burstyn, Mercouri, et al managed to do just that. This film can knock your socks off.",1325030400,,1256,4.553097345132743
7803082,5,6300133591,"I saw this film when it was first released, and had forgotten it's stunning power until I just watched the extra features on the DVD for the Lynch/Herzog collaboration, ""My son My son, What have ye Done."" So it seems that the writer of that film's initial inspiration for the project was, wow, ""A Dream of Passion."" Incredibly, it seems that this marvelous film has not only not been redistributed as a Criterion film, it's seems to not be available as a DVD at all!
Two of the brightest, most mercurial actresses of the last fifty years, and a brilliant director. It deserves criterion status. The clever conflation of the real life story and the mythic, alone, is amazing.",1289520000,8,674,4.6722689075630255
7803083,5,6300133591,"The matinee I went to during this film's original release in 1978 was meant simply to pass the time while I was on break from counseling in a camp for severely emotionally disturbed adolescent boys. It was to be a day of intense emotion indeed.

Mercouri's character is a Greek diva who returns to her native country after many years to perform in Euripides' play Medea on the actual stage in Dionysia where it was first performed in 431 B. C. Medea killed her own children to revenge her husband Jason's betrayal. Mercouri learns that an American in a nearby Greek prison actually did kill her own children to revenge her Greek husband's philandering. She interviews the woman in prison, played by Burstyn, initially for publicity, but finds herself assimilating into her rehearsals the passion the woman suffers as she tells her story.

The powerfully riveting performances of Burstyn and Mercouri in this spell-binding tale of love and betrayal, acted out and reenacted in the timeless story of the theme in Euripides' original story Medea, left me speechless in my chair. Others got up to leave. I just sat there. The next showing came and went, then a third. This movie left me paralyzed and mute for over six hours. I can honestly say, even thirty years later, that A Dream of Passion is the most memorable film I have ever seen.",1238284800,8,1335,4.75
7803084,5,6300133591,"Melina Mercouri plays a Greek actress in search of inspiration to play Medea. Once more the life has more imagination than you and I can imagine. So, the reality will come for her when she meets in a prison a Medea of the actual times: Ellen Burstyn has killed her three children in order to take revenge on her husband.

Jules Dassin (Rififi)  conducts this original proposal.",1125273600,,377,4.611940298507463
