A great goofy romance for those who like that type of movie. Sara Michelle Gellar did a great job. I would recommend this movie to others.",1466726400,,316,3.953125
1041407,1,6305499446,"I cannot believe how many great reviews there are of this movie, because it was just garbage. That's really the only way I can describe it. To be honest, I only watched it because of the podcast How Did This Get Made, which discusses bad movies, so I went into it expecting something bad. However, this was way worse than what I was expecting. First off, it's never a good thing when the main character is the most unlikeable character in the whole movie. To be fair, all the other characters were extremely unlikeable as well, so I guess we all lose, and I say we because the audience loses the hour and a half of their life spent watching this (though it felt like four hours). In addition to the characters sucking, the general premise and plot was dumb, and the whole thing seemed like the creators of the movie had a bunch of random ideas that they stuck together and it turned into this. Here's how I imagine their brainstorming went: What if there was a magic crab? Oh, the protagonist is magic now? How about people can feel her emotions through her magic food, thanks to the magic, unexplained crab? Also let's throw in the basic format for every rom-com ever, but let's not even do a good job of that! This movie was so bad that I couldn't even pay attention by the end, I was just bored. Overall, just a terrible, terrible movie. Yes, it's so bad I had to call it  terrible twice.",1466553600,,1391,4.370656370656371

It was a enjoyable film, but it was a major flaw in that it never really explained where the magic came from.  Was she just discovering she had powers, was it because of her mother, was it that magical crab or that elfish little man?  They should have given you some clue.  The storyline line had a small restaurant that had been in the family for a long time on the verge of closing with very few customers.  One of the owners, Amanda Shelton (Sarah Michelle Gellar) meets and falls in love with a handsome business executive (Sean Patrick Flanery) and suddenly her cooking starts taking on magically irresistable flavors that bring out her feelings.",1416268800,,728,4.784

1041860,4,6305499446,"This is a movie I have been searching for since my first copy was ""borrowed"" many years ago. While it is a slightly basic-made movie, anyone who loves a silly, romantic, feel-good movie can enjoy this. I love Sarah's reactions and delivery in several of these scenes, two of which include the ""situation wanted"" and ""men playing with their belts"" scenes. Her sous chef also delivers a few small nuggets too, such as ""crab napalm"". The small pieces make this movie enjoyable, but you'll want to look for them. The other reviews cover the more basic info of this item, so I'll refrain from being repetitive. :)

My one warning is that the cover shown is not the cover you'll receive. There were 2 versions of this selling when I decided to purchase this product. I bought this $7 version specifically for the original purple and blue cover shown. The version I received however was the newer pink cover version sold on a different page for $5. While the movie is good, I would have just bought the $5 version if I'd known that's what I'd be sent anyway and saved the extra $2. Buyer beware I suppose.",1411689600,,1098,4.545454545454546

1041913,5,6305499446,This is a great chic flick movie. I normally lean to the horror/suspense type of movies but I just love this one. Everyone plays their parts really well. Even the magic crab looks great in a top hat and you just go along with it. It's a movie that makes you feel good all over throughout. I think most guys would like it as well since the lead male doesn't want to commit to any relationship. That is until he falls for her and as they kiss they float up to the ceiling via help from the help of the magic crab. True love wins out in the end after some ups and downs but in the end you are the one feeling warm and fuzzy inside.,1406678400,,628,3.952755905511811

 It was great to see this incorporated by Sarah Michelle Geller who is a culinary wiz (family inherited) in the movie and how it brings love, peace,harmony to people who eat of its contents in a meal/pastry.

1042128,4,6305499446,"This is a nice little love story with a touch of magic thrown in. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a would be chef who has tried to maintain her mother's little restaurant after her death without success. On the verge of closing she's sent a little, what we may assume is, heavenly help. The help is not only to save her restaurant but to also meet the man of her dreams, Sean Patrick Flanery. Flanery plays the part of a business exec trying to open a luxury restaurant chain. He's also not had much luck with long lasting romantic relationships. She's smitten by him.

1042312,3,6305499446,"Please don't misunderstand me. I am a ""Buffy"" fan, not necessarily a ""Sarah"" fan.

Unlike this move, Buffy was carried by fantastic writing, a pretty good supporting cast, and a relatable premise that high school is, in fact, hell. The Buffyverse just took that idea very literally.

This, sadly, is not the Buffyverse.

The plus side:

Sarah's acting is passable and she plays on the cute appeal so often used in her most famous role.

Who can argue with the good looks of Sean Patrick Flannery? Those fans of him in the Boondock Saints can find him no less appealing for being the uptight manager of Bindel's department store.

It is a cute love story. It's not brilliant, it won't stand the test of time to be considered a real ""Classic"" in the Casablanca sense of the term but the story is undeniably cute.

Sean Patrick Flannery's secretary, Lois. I love her character and I've never seen Patricia Clarkson do anything less than sparkle on screen. If this movie had more of her character's sharp wit then it might have warrented a higher rating.

The idea of a fairy godfather. Sure, he's only a plot device and gets about 5 minutes of airtime but it's just good to see that fairy godparents believe in equal rights.

The minus side:

It's heartily predictable; though, I'm not sure this is a real minus. Most cheesy, cute romances are predictable.

Because of the formulaic qualities of the script, the movie can drag in parts and reiterate things that really didn't need to be rehashed.

The acting is, at times, flat and this is mostly compliments of Ms. Gellar.

I just find the script to be infantile. No one really grows, no one really changes. The thing that pushes this plot along is Sarah's discovery of transferred empathy through her cooking and this is at the hands, er, claws of her fairy god crab and the desire to have the movie's ""hottie""

The long and short of it all, it's a cute movie that I find the urge to watch once in a blue moon. It's not something I'll ever feel the need to own, but it is something I'll pay a buck or two to rent every couple of years if they're not showing it on Starz.",1268352000,,2119,4.484375

Not a profoundly written film, but a good romance comedy for a quick rental.  Sean Patrick Flannery is rather catching as the love interest and his assistant ""Lois"" played by Patricia Clarkson is wonderful with her dry wit.
Sarah Michelle Gellar is just OK, but her wardrobe (designed by Todd Oldham) deserves an honorable mention.

For foodies there are several troublesome items: Sarah Michelle Gellars character ""Amanda"" never wears a full chefs apron (except for once) and she constantly plays with her hair and continues cooking without washing her hands.  She doesn't have her hair tied back or secured.  Might not bother other people, but it really distracted me, considering she is cooking in a restaurant.  Minor details I guess, but it just gets on your nerves after a while.

I also like all sorts of movies, especially romantic ones, set in the Big Apple with lavish department store scenes and lots of outfits. And I'm a sucker for magic.

But, despite (or maybe because of) having all of the above, this film doesn't work. The magic is a substitute for a real plot.  A weird little crab, apparently sent by Amanda's dead mother, casts a spell over her cooking, so that she can find the man of her dreams and save the family restaurant. And yes, it is as bad as it sounds. (I kept waiting for someone accidentally to throw the crab into a pot of boiling water, but sadly this does not happen.) The film can't seem to decide whether it wants to be ""Who's Got Mail?"" or ""Harry Potter."" The characters are even confused. ""That's no ordinary crab,"" observes Amanda in the middle of the film. No duh! What interest can we find in characters who are being manipulated by a crustacean?

The scenes (and there is more than one) where Amanda throws vanilla orchids into a pot of cream to produce a huge amount of dry-ice fog are truly dreadful. Following one of them, she and her boyfriend, restaurant entrepreneur Tom Bartlett played by Sean Patrick Flanery (whose perfectly moussed hair somewhat belies the emotional disturbance he is supposed to be feeling), dance to a band that only they and the audience can hear. ""What about that band?"" asks Amanda. ""It was a hallucination,"" replies Tom.

""An angel and his magical crab help a good-hearted, but lousy chef save her dead mother's restaurant and the heart of a cynical handsome businessman.""

Jaws drop.

Suit #1: What an amazing idea!

Suit #2: A magical crab? Will it sing calypso music?

Suit #3: Name it Sebastian!

Suit #1: That's been done.

Idea Guy: No, no calypso. But great food. Mouthwatering.  Sexy eclairs.

Suit #2: Yes, yes! Marvelous!

Suit #1: Wait - what's an eclair? Some kind of doughnut?

Suit #2: No,it's an elongated pastry filled with custard or whipped cream.

Suit #3: (chuckles,elbows Suit#1) O-kay. I get that metaphor.

Idea Guy: There's a scene where the magical crab wears a lettuce leaf and waves to the handsome businessman as he enters the kitchen.

Suit #3: (nods head excitedly) That is *exactly* the kind of movie we need to make!

This movie is odd in every sense, but that's why I like it. It's not your typical romance movie.

The result is a tragically stupid mess, presented on DVD with no extras whatsoever that might offer some explanation.

Or did she? Thanks to a magical crab, and Amanda's feelings for Tom inspiring her, her cooking takes off, as does business at her almost-closed restaurant, and soon Tom decides that the woman he's dating is too much like the mother in WITHOUT CONSENT (the one who throws her daughter in a mental hospital where patients are mistreated), and dumps her for Amanda. Soon, the two are inseparable, and all sorts of magical things happen between them. At one point, the day before a big banquet to celebrate Tom's new restaurant, his chef quits in a temperamental outburst, and Tom's boss brings Amanda in to cook. The result is a wonderful meal that everyone in attendance loves, and in the end, you're supposed to assume that Amanda and Tom end up together.

1042499,4,6305499446,"Mmmm, mussels...

They provide an excellent metaphor for this little known romantic comedy as they are an unforgiving shell surrounding an unmistakeably unique tasting meat.  Either you like them or you don't and so it is with this film.  If you have trouble enjoying the average Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan canoodler then this movie probably isn't for you.  Only the truly romantic who believe in spells and rapture will appreciate ""Simply Irresistible"".

The story doesn't always make sense as it tends to meander off in odd ways just like the character Stella, (played dizzily by Betty Buckley), but this is also part of its charm, it's unpredictability.  There is a woozy style to the filmmaking that perfectly captures the story's setup.  A young chef finds love and fulfillment at the claws of a magical crab.  As silly as it sounds, ""Simply Irresistible"" is also incredibly sincere, with first rate performances from all involved.

However even the tastiest mussels sometimes get gritty and there are enough (what the?) moments in ""Simply Irresistible"" to snap first time viewers out of their trances.  This is a film that actually improves the more you watch it, as the discordant moments tend to soften with exposure.

The ending is by far the movie's weakest link as it asks the viewer to believe in an instantaneous makeover for the movie's star and revisit a restaurant scene that has long exhausted its interest.  How much better would it have been if leading man Tom, (Sean Patrick Flanery), had met Amanda, (Sarah Michelle Gellar), on the pavement in front of the department store and taken her for a walk through the nighttime streets of midtown Manhattan?  We would have gotten to see more of their admirable chemistry, and maybe been given a glance at how their relationship would develop after the credit roll.  Instead we're left literally dangling in mid air feeling a bit silly.

Because of its flawed ending, I can only give ""Simply Irresistible"" four stars and certain plot holes would have reduced this score to three if it weren't for the always inventive use of soundtrack in the movie.  One plot hole that particularly disappoints is the disappearance of Amanda's benefactor Gene O'Reilly, (played wonderfully by playwright Christopher Durang), after the film's first few minutes.  More of his presence might have helped to ease the audience into the magical realism the script so heavily relies upon.

Thankfully moments of spontaneous convergence abound, when the dialogue, acting, and direction merge into such effortless liquidity that it's like watching a lava lamp; hypnotic.  Nothing creates this effect better than Patricia Clarkson's sumptuously brassy performance as Tom's assistant Lois.  Every scene she's in she steals and her seduction of department store tycoon Jonathan Bendel, (Dylan Baker), more than justifies the suspension of disbelief this film requires.

Flanery and Gellar work well together here with Flanery delicately walking a fine line as an ambitious yet romantically feckless young executive enchanted by Amanda's cooking and then by Amanda herself.  My favorite moment: when Tom arrives at Amanda's very busy restaurant to break things off with her only to be smitten all over again as she hands him a customer's plate to deliver.  The song ""Secret Smile"" by Semisonic starts to swell as Amanda intones ""The mussels are ready"" while beaming a thousand watt grin in his direction.

1042538,5,6305499446,"I love a good love story as much as the next guy - probably more than the next guy, actually - and Simply Irresistible is a thoroughly charming little romantic comedy that depicts a love that is thoroughly magical and pure.  Many a good romantic film is ruined for me by the onrush of a carnal, physical relationship that occurs far too soon and removes the glitter surrounding something beautiful.  This movie does not do that, thereby managing to convey, at least to me, the very essence of true love.  Giving a brand new twist to the old saying that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, Simply Irresistible is not a conventional love story by any means, yet the rather unexplainable and unaccountable things that take place only add to the true magic of events.
You must first suspend your disbelief of Sarah Michelle Gellar having any trouble whatsoever winning a man's heart.  Her character, Amanda Shelton, is utterly precious and adorable, exuding an aura of innocence that is far removed from the equally powerful yet quite different presence Gellar displays in her more familiar role as Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Amanda is the cook in her late mother's restaurant, struggling to keep the business up and running.  Her customers love her and the atmosphere of the place, but when it comes right down to it, Amanda is not a very good cook.  One strange morning, a strange man at the market sells her a case of crabs, one of which scurries off, thereby causing her to bump into Tom Bartlett (Sean Patrick Flanery).  A short time later, Amanda's fairy godfatherly helper leads Bartlett and his current girlfriend to Amanda's restaurant.  Struggling to prepare the Crab Napoleon she had mentioned to Bartlett at the time of their first meeting - a dish she has no idea how to make - she is amazed to find the dish prepared without any conscious effort on her part.  Suddenly, Amanda is a terrific cook; not only does her food taste scrumptious, it has strange effects on the people who partake of it (easily breaking the bond between Tom's current girlfriend and himself).  This element of weirdness proves to be a problem of sorts for her seemingly predestined romance with Bartlett, as he comes to think of her as some sort of witch.  Were I to levitate each time Sarah Michelle Gellar kissed me, that would not be a problem for yours truly, yet Tom somehow disapproves of love-inspired levitation with Amanda.  Certainly, this most unusual young lady has bewitched him, but the secret behind Amanda's newfound culinary skills and magical effect on Tom and everyone else who eats her cooking is in fact a crab.  Undeniably, the whole crab business is pretty weird, but the romance that blooms slowly and not without a struggle between Amanda and Tom is a classic one sure to warm the hearts of those who are not complete cynics when it comes to love.",1057795200,2,2869,4.712

Sarah Michelle Gellar's softer side appears as she picks up the batterie de cuisine and tackles saving a restaurant from certain death. When it looks like Amanda's career is about to end as a chef, an angel appears in her life and gives her some sage advice about looking for a door that will open when another one closes. As the chef of a failing 70 year-old restaurant, the Southern Cross, she only has her loyal clientele who are not there for the food.

To say she is adorable as a chef is an understatement. She appears in a variety of fashionable outfits and weaves a sweet innocent spell on the viewer. Worth watching to see Sarah dressed up in a variety of outfits and different hairstyles.

There are also scenes of outdoor markets, beautiful orchids and of course restaurant scenes, Sarah shopping, cooking and crawling about on the floor chasing after magical crabs all to romantic music.

Instead of slaying vampires, ""Buffy"" bewitches Tom Bartlett (Sean Patrick Flanery) and entices love right into her life through cooking a variety of gourmet dishes. If every man has his weakness, Tom's weakness is luscious cuisine.

As every kitchen sorceress has discovered, the right food can create the right mood and can invite happiness and love into your life. I loved the dance scene and the scene where Tom and Amanda disappear into the scented mist. This movie emphasizes the aphrodisiac qualities of food.

Amanda Shelton (Sarah) only discovers her true cooking talents after meeting Tom. At first she seems unaware of her current fate while Tom seems to be trying to control his fate. He is disturbed by his lack of emotional control and when he falls ""in love"" with Amanda, his world seems to be spinning out of control.

""My whole life was ordinary and then we met and these amazing things started to happen."" ~Amanda

Is it love that makes Amanda a better cook and makes her cooking taste even better to Tom? Are their senses in a state of heightened awareness from the chemicals rushing through their bodies or is there magic floating about? Once she finds a recipe for caramel clairs, Tom is even more attracted to her.

There are very few movies about cooking or chefs so this one is a treat. Tear drops in the food reminded me of Like Water for Chocolate. The emotions Amanda feels are somehow magically mixed into the food she is cooking. Either the dishes make people cry, stun them or make them lose their inhibitions. She seems to have a magical gift for culinary creations that have an effect on anyone who consumes them.

Is the orchid plant in this movie the ""Oncidium Sharry Baby?"" It did look similar, although I can't say for sure. Some people say it has a fruity vanilla scent and not really a chocolate scent. Most types of vanilla do not produce the vanilla beans. If you wanted to cook with flowers, you would want to make sure that the flowers you added to your cooking were edible. Orchid flowers are apparently edible.

Vanilla beans are the cigar-shaped seed pods from a climbing orchid and the pods must be picked, boiled and heated in the sun. It literally takes months to produce the delicious vanilla flavor. It actually takes 100 beans to make 1 gallon of vanilla extract. If you love vanilla extract, you might also enjoy: Fiori di Sicilia flavoring for your baking.

After watching this movie you may want to feed your lover oranges, invest in some expensive vanilla extract, get lost in a kiss or cook up some bliss. If you are looking for the best vanilla for your cooking, Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla is superior.

Deliciously cute, silly spells, sweet innocent love and a few hot and steamy kissing scenes in the kitchen. For romantics and lovers of kitchens and cuisine. Almost a culinary Cinderella story.

Despite that (or perhaps with that thought firmly in mind), SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is an enjoyable little film, far enough down the reality scale to provide a brief diversion. The crab is a hoot, though its wires are visible in one scene.

It depicts how even when you encounter true love, how some people can't handle it because instead of enjoying and treasuring the moment, they feel as though they are giving up life as they know it and they don't realize that life as they knew it, was no life at all.  Life is short and you must savor every moment and people come and go so fast, that even if someone comes into your life but only for a short time, it may possibly be the most passionate and intense love you'll ever know.  This movie is sweet and romantic and it leaves out all of the hot and steamy situations that people think make a good relationship.  It's a movie that pre-teenagers can watch and bottom line is that being in love is great.  Reviewing it at another angle, it shows how, Amanda's mother, even though she is not with her, through O'Reilly and the ""special"" helps her get the restaurant and her love life in order.

Sarah plays a young girl who has no parents, and she lives by herself, and she runs her mom's resturaunt with her aunt. When the resturaunt may have to close because rent can't be kept up, somehow, Sarah's character starts to make delicious, delectable, irrisistible food that everyone falls in love with. She meets this guy who is opening a resturaunt, and the film just flows out from there.

It's fun, sweet, romantic, and just simply enjoyable all the way through.
This movie certainly boasts a top-notch cast that is led by the wonderful and amazing Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flanery.  Amanda, played by Sarah Michelle, starts off as an awful chef but almost magically turns into a wonderful one overnight.  She then begins falling in love with Tom, played by Sean Patrick, who is the owner of a popular department store.
Simply Irresistible tells a wonderful and romantic story of how scary falling in love can truly be and how wonderful it can be all at the same time.  If you're in the mood for a light, romantic comedy, then I highly recommend this movie.",1025913600,31,1010,4.742857142857143
1042613,1,6305499446,"Remember MST3K, that show where the little silhouetted heads on the bottom of the screen would make fun of bad films?  They'd have a blast with this one.  These pointless romantic comedies are becoming the new B-level sci-fi flicks.  And that's this film's only redeeming quality.

How can I begin to critique the poor quality of film this is?  Let's start with plot.  Here's how a romantic comedy show work: boy & girl meet, boy & girl like each other, conflict occurs where it looks like they can't be together, in the end they always do.  Here, they just couldn't think of a conflict.  Two thirds in, the guy suddenly thinks: ""Hey, I don't wanna be with this girl, she can fly!""  This weak conflict is NEVER RESOLVED!!!  Instead, the guy just conveniantly decides that he loves her after all and turns around to go back to the party where they fly together.
Then comes all the loose ends: the mother's earrings, the magic crab, the fairy godfather, etc.  The concept of food serving as symbolism for sex was used much better in Chocolat, by the way.  The music video at the end was incredibly stupid, also by the way.
Hey, I like Sarah Gellar.  If you watch this and then watch Cruel Intentions you'll see how diverse an actress she can be.  But since this just plain [stinks], I encourage you all to rent it to poke fun at.  Sarah's ""Do you realize how many different words there are for delicious?"" monolouge is an excellent target.

From that point on, Gellar's luck changes and she becomes a great cook, putting all of herself in her work.
I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. The plot was predictable and most of the it was stolen directly from LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE. In fact, this movie is basically LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE for teens. It's nice to see Gellar in a girl-next-door role instead of some vampire-killing sleeze or sexy, but loose woman role (stars are much more beautiful when they play down to earth characters). Flanery's character lacks depth, but it isn't the actors fault and it's nice to see him working again.

Whatever Amanda's emotions are, the same emotions go into the food she cooks.
 Simply Irresistible was full of fun dialogue and scenes which came from the actions of some pretty quirky characters. Everyone in Simply Irresistible was lovable. Even Amanda Peet's cameo, in which she played a snobby rich girl, was likable.
 The best thing about Simply Irresistible has to be its score. When the score is playing, it goes right along with the actions of the characters, right down to their footsteps. It sounded a bit Mary Tyler Moore-ish, but it worked well.

1042619,4,6305499446,"UPDATED Dec 6, 2017 FOR GRAMMATICAL AND STRUCTURAL REASONS. My views have significantly changed since the writing of this review, and I am a lot more Biblically grounded now. If you're not a Christian, do not concern yourself with that, just read my original review.

ORIGINAL UPDATED REVIEW 2001:

There are a few reasons this movie wasn't a big box office hit. 1. The story lacks luster. 2. The acting from the lead male is not convincing. 3. Its a typical love story...Not much twist... Which would be fine had the script and male lead been a little better.

The basic plot of this movie is lifted straight from ""Like Water for Chocolate"" where the female lead (in this case Sarah Michelle Gellar) realizes that whatever she feels, will go in to her cooking. The way in which the story is told in this movie is more on the cutesy side with a magical crab that grants her the ability to transfer her emotions to her cooking, which previously was sinking the restaurant she inherited from her mother. It is a cute movie that borrows a number of its scenes from old movies with Fred Astaire, most notably the floating to the ceiling bit with Gellar and Flannery.

The movie in general is sweet, but what really keeps this movie from being great, is the flat male lead Sean Patrick Flannery, he just does not have enough charisma to be a romantic male lead. Gellar is cute though, and this is one of her few roles outside of Buffy the Vampire Slayer that seemed to find her in her comfort zone much more than  later roles such as Daphne in Scooby Doo.

It is a cute film that is one of those that you might catch on TV on a lazy Sunday afternoon, and it is one that is worth watching, maybe not buying, but at least a watch.

It turns out  that I'd already seen the best part of the movie -- the ending. Gellar's  character triumphs over adversity and rides off happily into the sunset. Or  whatever. But the screenwriters and/or producers threw together a patchwork  of half baked nonsense to get us there.
It turns out that Gellar's  triumph wasn't over adversity, it was over her own incompetence. She  started the movie as the propretor/cook of a small Manhattan eatery that  she inherited from her parents. The handful of regular patrons remain  purely out of inertia, since Gellar's cooking is reputed to be awful. That  is, until the day she buys a ""magic crab"" whose presence in her  kitchen transforms her miserable attempts at cooking into works of art. I'm  sorry, but such a premise doesn't inspire sympathy for a character, no  matter how pretty she is.
There are a few obvious parallels with the  wonderful ""Like Water For Chocolate,"" like bouts of anger and  tears that obviously affect those who eat Gellar's cooking. But the  thinness of the rest of the movie make these homages look like failed  attempts at cinematic hipness.
There are a few nice moments, notably the  scene where her crush, who becomse obsessed with her cooking,  ""mugs"" an elderly couple who have some carry-out treats from  Gellar's restaraunt. But a romantic scene is marred by unexplained (and  thankfully unrepeated) levitation.

I agree with the earlier reviewer who liked Patricia Clarkson.  She's a talented actress who surpasses the limitations of her role in this  film. But the movie isn't about her--it's about Gellar, Flannery, and the  magic of a crab (a _crab_? what were the writers thinking?). If that crab  was powerful enough to make Gellar's character a better cook, why couldn't  it make Gellar herself a better actress, or Mark Tarlov a better director?",961632000,3,735,5.024793388429752

The movie is slight and whimsical -- lots of magic,  not a lot of gritty reality -- but it's sweet and strange and has a lot of  charm.  The characters are daffy and whimsically painted, and don't go the  usual hollywood movie route.  Gellar is sweet and insecure as the heroine  -- a much less glamorous role than her weekly (equally fabulous) vampire  slaying Buffy heroine -- while Buckley and Flanery and the fine supporting  cast are all enjoyable to watch in the romantic mishaps that ensue.  The  wonderful Patricia Clarkson meanwhile is so much fun that she steals every  scene she's in without detracting a bit from the appeal of her costars -- a  pretty good trick (it's worth the price of admission to hear her say,  ""This is nutty.  Hazel-nutty."").
I really loved this movie --  started out wondering where it was going, but by the end I didn't care --  the writing is offbeat and fun, not so by the book.  The movie's not  ""Schindler's List"" or anything, sure -- it's pretty lightweight  -- but it doesn't feel as Hollywood-ish as your usual romantic comedy, and  you really never know what the characters will say next.  The food also  looks glorious and really adds to the sense of whimsy.  The soundtrack is  as sweet and fun as everything else -- if you need cheering up, or  convincing that there's still a bit of Astaire and Rogers in the world,  this one's a great choice, where a perfect eclair can create true love, and  a wonderful meal can make people weep with delight (and float in the air a  time or two)...",952128000,33,1704,4.45928338762215

OK, the movie is a romantic fantasy, but isn't that why we watch  movies.  To be entertained.  Sarah plays the part OK, but the supporting  cast and soundtrack is what makes this movie work.  The music just seems to  sit in the back of your mind, and you'll find yourself trying to remember  the songs.  First buy this movie, but also but the soundtrack.  It grows on  you.  This movie didn't get good reviews from the critics, but for me, I go  see the one's they don't like.  A movie is for your entertainment, to leave  reality for about 2 hours.  Believe me, after watching this movie, you'll  be walking on air",951868800,3,767,4.357142857142857

1042704,3,6305499446,This is a movie that manages to lift up your heart and put you in a good mood. It has a certain charm to it-unlike many movies that are being made today. You grow to like all the characters. And you just know how the end  will turn out-they have to get together!  But it's what happens in  between that has the OLD BLACK MAGIC to it.

I was somewhat skeptical of the plot, but after watching it once, I must have watched it 50 times since.

Maybe being a big fan of SMG, since the All My Children days, helped with me liking the movie. But if she wasn't in it,  then I'm sure I would have still liked it. And it was also good to see  Sarah play something other then a scream queen, or a vampire slayer.",947894400,,428,3.9651162790697674
1042707,5,6305499446,"This movie is for those of use who still beleive in Magic. The magic of Romance and the magic of Love. Sarah Michelle Gellar excelled in her role in this light-hearted romance. And to her I would like to say Well  Done.
So for everyone who was critical of Sarah and the movie think on  this ""What is right for one soul may not be right for another.""  Just because you have forgotten how to smile is no reason to stop  others.
This movie is for anyone who still beleives in magic and wants to  end their night with a smile. Watch it. You will not be disappointed",945648000,3,561,4.157407407407407

It was great seeing sarah michelle Gellar in a different type of role.  This is a great love story  with great chemistry between the actors.  It is a very touching movie  especially in a day where a good clean movie is so hard to find.,944438400,3,352,4.043478260869565
1042709,5,6305499446,"O kay, I'll admit. It was a little of the wall but hey, come on, this was WAY more realistic than terminator, the matrix, etc. etc. So don't even go into how weird this movie was. The movie does take some time to get into  I'll give you that. But it is a WONDERFUL movie overall. It's a sweet and  touching romance with a little bit of comedy and suspence. Anyone with a  heart would like this movie.  And how dare the people who snub this  movie. They probably have only seen action movies and the stupid movies.  This movie is more for adults and MATURE people who can understand the  theme and truly enjoy it.  This movie also brought a point back to me  that was very inportant Amanda(geller) still grieving for her mom and  tightly holding on made me come forth and deal with my own recent death in  the family. This movie once again is for people who want a)a good cry  b)a  good laugh  c)need some hope and encouragment.  I hope you like the  movie as much as I did. True i am a softy but then again that's WHO THIS  MOVIE WAS MADE FOR. And if you don't enjoy it then simply make it non  irresistible. But DONT try and persaude People. Who knows you might be an  action person. What ever. It doesn't matter.  I didn't write this  review to persaude people to watch it. Just to let people know if its right  for them.
P.S. I AM NOT ASHAMED FOR MAKING THIS MOVIE!",943747200,30,1368,4.180769230769231

1042741,5,6305499446,"Sarah Michelle Gellar is a delight to watch in this light-hearted romance. It was a wonderful movie to watch with my two neices(both are avid Buffy fans). This is a terrific date movie, espescially for our impressionable  youths. Ms. Gellar shows us all that you CAN be the sweet and well mannered  girl next door and still be very much attractive(and down right sexy). It  was also refreshing to see real emotions, like nervousness and uncertenty,  when her character was faced with some pretty overwhelming situations.  Nobody is totally self assured and in charge of their emotions all the  time. I was nice to see something real for a change. Applause, Applause,  Applause!",939945600,3,677,4.938053097345133
1042742,3,6305499446,"Sarah Gellar is this movie. Without her, I would wonder for what tax dodge was it even made. With her, we have a whimisical, sweet, lyrical bit of watchable fluff. It is odd; the secondary actors are all never-will-bees,  the camera work is shoddy, the effects work laughable, the male lead spends  the entire film in dreamland, the sets are depressing and the script has  first draft written all over it. Yet there Gellar glows with enthusiasm,  tenderness, wit and beauty, and that is enough.
She has great comic  timing, her beats are dead spot on. A dramatic actress, her gentle tears  douse my soul. When she cooks, I'm hungry. I don't know how she spent the  summer but I hope she rested or made a movie worthy of her. This one  certainly is not. But it is watchable.
The DVD's picture quality is soft  and washed out, but I saw this movie in a good theatre and any problems  with the picture can be traced back to the original camerawork. There is  little in the way of supplementary material. The menus transitions are  cute.
Recommendation: if you love Sarah Gellar buy this movie. If not,  you will be happier elsewhere.",939427200,7,1130,4.562189054726368

7890764,1,6305499446,"The worst is that this script was written by a woman - although who knows if the original script portrayed the lead as an imbecile.  I disagree with most of the one-star reviewers, in that the concept of the movie is entirely engaging.  And then, the movie folk made portray the lead character an imbecile.  Not just an imbecile.  Even more maddening is that the imbecile wins.  That the imbecile is so strongly supported by the people around her, especially sous chef Nolan, (Lawrence Gillard Jr.), that the viewer also wonders if they figured that either they support Amanda, or she'd end up on the streets, which, surely would be the case, and, ultimately, I'm sure, was the case.  The lowest-level kitchen worker would have been boiled in stock as much as Amanda touches her hair, touches the food, and never washes her hands.  But that's the least of it.

 Even if, (the horribly miscast), Gellar hadn't been the lead - although I'd say that Lawrence Gillard Jr., and Patricia Clarkson were the stars of this film - the portrayal of this imbecile of a young woman, whose every single utterance and behavior, (which has directly been linked to a rise in blood pressure), is deplorable,  ""You, who thinks I do not understand/speak French?""  Oh my gawd.  There is something seriously wrong with Amanda.

I own this film, and watch it once or twice a year when I crave watching all the other characters, and to imagine the food, but it always makes me crazy.  Why did they allow the Amanda character to be one of the most despised characters ever created.  Was this MEANT to be a torture film?",1515196800,,1594,4.642857142857143
