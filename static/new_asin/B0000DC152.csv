1923712,5,B0000DC152,"This movie is alot different than van damme's usual movies. This movie has a more serious plot. Him and his wife are living in russia becasue van damme has to work there. his wife is murdered and when van damme takes the killer to court, they let the killer off, due to lack of evidence. Van damme comes out of the room takes a pistal and kills him right outside the court doors. He is sent to a jail where the people where the guards don't give a crap about the people in the prison. There are many fight battles. The battles come about when either 2 men want to fight against each other, or the guards want to pick 2 fighters. The owner of the prison bets on the winner and thats how he makes money. This movie has good acting, action scenes and realism. This is a must see, for all movie fans.",1069718400,2,796,4.141935483870967

No impressive martial arts used here. Maybe a 2 star movie with a good unknown actor here where people aren't expecting great martial art kicks and punches.

1923728,4,B0000DC152,"2003 wasn't looking promising for fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme: their hero had been making direct-to-video features for the last four years, and his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/most-recent-one/dp/B0000DJZ9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">most recent one</a>&nbsp;was on-par with the worst Steven Seagal offerings of the era. Then came ""In Hell,"" and their faith had reason to be restored. The movie held its own in video rentals better than any of his previous low-budget flicks, and by being such a well-made departure from typical action vehicles, it showed that Van Damme was definitely capable of advancing his image while in exile from Hollywood. Though I have my issues with the film, I don't think it's farfetched to say that ""In Hell"" acted as a wake-up call to the entire DTV action industry, letting all know that not getting a theatrical release was not permission for a film to be technically and dramatically substandard.

The story: an American living in Russia (Van Damme) is sent to one of the nation's cruelest prisons for killing the murderer of his wife. Inside, he is faced with the worst kind of human perversity and corruption. Pushed into fighting matches between the inmates, his biggest fight of all will be to retain his own humanity.

I'm not at all an aficionado of prison movies, and this film is a good example of why. The human exploitation which inevitably works its way into these pictures goes against everything I consider entertaining in films, especially when it's done with the amount of quasi-realism you see here. The abuse of inmates by the prison guards, the repeated raping of a character played by Chris Moir (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatchetman/dp/B0002MFFH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatchetman</a>), and the sheer hopelessness expressed in the first half of the film are all hard to digest. But this isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B0000399WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>, with a cast of proven actors who can manipulate me into feeling as uncomfortable as they want; this is a Jean-Claude Van Damme film with minimal dramatic expectations that ended up displaying better dramatic quality than anybody could've imagined. It's unfathomable how legitimately theatrical this movie is, especially when you consider that it's written by two newcomers to the business and doesn't star any acclaimed actors (Van Damme's immediate costar is pro football player Lawrence Taylor, and even he comes off looking good). Ringo Lam, who'd already done&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maximum-Risk/dp/076780970X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maximum Risk</a>&nbsp;with Van Damme, squeezes every drop of his skill as a filmmaker into this one's direction, making it authentic and respectable even for non-action fans. Yes, I'm still talking about a Van Damme movie here, but if you're looking for a vehicle of his that's approachable by non-devotees, this one's it.

The movie includes illegal prison fighting matches, but it's to the film's credit that these are treated in general as a supplement while not leaving the rest of the picture wanting. However, even the fights are to Van Damme's acclaim. There's no fancy martial artistry going on here - just gritty brawling, with some kicking, a couple judo throws, and plenty of grounded wrestling. Van Damme's ventured into this style of fight choreography before, but it didn't look natural for him before now. ""In Hell"" makes Jean-Claude comfortable with a pure MMA style, and even though next to none of the fights are grade-A encounters in my book, his eventual showdown with the gigantic Michael Bailey Smith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes/dp/B000FAOC2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes</a>) is plenty entertaining - sort of a more intense redo of the finale from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Warrant/dp/B0000542CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Warrant</a>.

With the exception of the questionable CGI moth seen in a couple scenes, the production is impeccably slick. More so than any other from the last ten years, this Van Damme picture *looks* like a Hollywood production. This rounds off one of the best-made low-budget pictures I've ever seen, and the one which I think helped begin to differentiate Van Damme from his competition at this point in his career. Seagal or Lundgren would have never done this movie, and it's pictures of this distinction that continue making being a Van Damme fan fun these days. Buy it.",1336867200,2,4772,6.0132352941176475
1923729,4,B0000DC152,"Something happened to Van Damme in the new millennium which very few film goers,other than his hardcore fans,really picked up on. Many of his films became much edgier and in the last decade he has produced some of the best and more compelling films of his career;and In Hell(released June/03) is no exception. This hard edged film starring Van Damme and directed by the eccentric Ringo Lam,is their third collaboration together. The film starts out nice and easy but gets grittier and grittier as the film progresses with terribly graphic and violent action,and populated by some pretty dysfunctional characters.
The plot involves Van Damme as Kyle,an American who works in Russia with a pretty wife. On his way home from work one evening while talking to his better half on the cell phone,their connection is disrupted on her end when she is confronted by an unknown assailant. Kyle hears the struggle and races through the streets to get home. He finds his wife on the floor dead and the perp still in the house. Kyle gives chase but he is cut short by the police who mistake him for the perp. They do end up catching the assailant who goes on trial for the murder of Kyle's wife,but gets off scott-free. Kyle is so despondent at the verdict that outside the courtroom he grabs a security guards gun and shoots the man dead. This leads to Kyle's trial for murder,and of course he gets sent to a Russian prison.
It is a terribly tough environment for inmates in the institution and Kyle,along with other new inmates,quickly learn their place in the prison pecking order. A young man that enters with Kyle is immediately pegged as the ""pigeon"",shall we say,for one particular prisoners' ""delights"".Kyle is himself constantly picked on and more often than not,he is sent into confinement in a cold,damp cell through which the prison waste flows. He loses himself eventually,even tries to commit suicide unsuccessfully but after a few visits by a moth(who he believes is his wife),he decides to take on the prison system on its terms and begins to train to fight while in confinement and out.
Fight after fight ensues and Kyle becomes the prisons favourite,bet on by all the prison staff,including the warden. When his young friend eventually succumbs to one too many ""encounters"",it wakes him up and he decides not to fight a special inmate transferred in from another prison. He is put in chains outside day and night for his disobedience and the prison inmates finally rebel and all refuse to fight. Kyle does not give in and when he is returned to his cell,his cell mate tells him he can get him out and hands him a book listing every murder that the prison staff have committed over the two decades he has been there. Kyle,in order for the escape plan to go through,must fight one more time. The warden has told his guards to kill Kyle after the fight,and when the dust settles and Kyle's nemesis is defeated,he is escorted to a large garage to be driven out of the prison. It is here his cell mate jumps one of the guards which enables Kyle to take care of the other. It's a prison staff car and he makes a clean break out of the prison. His cell mate confronts the warden,tears his tongue out and drinks the wardens blood from a decanter. Due to his diary Kyle gives to the authorities,the prison is shut down two months later.
When you read this scenario you might think,oh great here's another movie where Van Damme karate chops and kicks his way through more film footage. Not the case. What makes this totally UN-Van Damme-ish is the fact that for the first 45 minutes he is constantly getting the crap beat out of him. And when he finally realizes its' better to join them than to beat them,there are few if any fancy karate kicks or spins that you usually associate with him. He's like his fellow prisoners and just uses his fists. There is a startling scene where Van Damme(with scraggy long hair,not like his usual looks),is fighting the man that not only continually hounded HIM,but constantly raped his young friend. The man has got Van Damme down and there is no way he's winning as he is being dragged around the grounds in a delirium. Just when you think the guy is going to deliver Van Damme a final blow,Van Damme pulls it out from somewhere,gets the guy down,jumps on him and chews on the guys neck. The guards pull him off and he turns over screaming with blood all over his face,as if it had brought him back to life,like a vampire. Startling and gross,yes,and doubled in impact(double impact...hmmmm)because it's again not what we expect from him.
Technically speaking this DVD comes in BOTH widescreen and fullscreen,unlike the Amazon blurb which just lists fullscreen. It is also available in Dolby 2.1 or 5.1 sound,with or without subtitles. There is also a 15 minute featurette on the making of the movie. By and large the film is clear and crisp but it does at times get a bit grainy.
All in all this film is one of the most Un-Van Damm-ish movies you will ever see,especially when it involves the amount of physical action this does. It starts out nice and easy but gets edgier and grittier as the film roles along with alot of ""ewww"" and turn your head moments when the action gets white hot.
This is just one of many of Van Damme's better films from the last decade. He has improved so much over the years as an actor and a director. The trouble is the larger general audience seems to be oblivious to this fact. Maybe his upcoming appearance/exposure in the Expendables 2 will hopefully correct some of that.",1320883200,,5541,4.6378433367243135
1923730,4,B0000DC152,"Kyle's (Jean Claude Van Damme) wife is murdered and, though the culprit is caught, when the case goes to trial, there's not enough evidence to convict him. Taking matters into his own hands, Kyle kills the man himself right after and is sentenced to life in Krava prison in Russia. Once there, Kyle discovers the crooked warden hosts fighting battles on the grounds and bets with other wardens who bring fighters in from other prisons.

At first content to fight, Kyle makes a name for himself as someone not be messed with, but when a close friend is killed, he decides to lower his hands and fight no longer. Following his example, the other inmates no longer fight as well, and the entire order of the prison is challenged.

But one of the inmates has a secret and in order for the prison to be brought down once and for all, Kyle must step into the ring one last time.

I got to say I was really impressed with this. This was the first Van Damme prison movie I've seen since Death Warrant and, frankly, had a blast watching it. This flick has a strong story and isn't your usual fair of Van Damme merely fighting and winning the ""big one"" at the end. Instead, it's the story of one man's journey to do what's right inside prison walls and learning when it's time to walk away.

As for the fighting, though, yeah, much more realistic than other JCVD flicks. Lots more wrestling, arm holds, close toe-to-toe stuff, and, dare I say, didn't have a single patented Van Damme 360-kick in it. The matches were also pretty much 50-50 in terms of blows exchanged, instead of Van Damme winning all the fights until the final guy, then gets his butt beat for ten minutes, before having a big comeback where he dominates and wins (with that 360-kick). The fights in this flick were more blow-for-blow, with one guy winning after the other guy gets knocked out.

I really enjoyed this, so if you're in a JCVD mood but also want a good story that sucks you in from the start, In Hell is the way to go.

Recommended.

Very good acting on Van Dammes part. Nice to see him take some beatings rather than always handing them out.

I guarantee you will appreciate JCVD in another vein after viewing this film. And it is a film not just a movie. JCVD gives one of his best performances in this gripping thriller. He plays a guy whose wife is killed by a drugged lunatic, is sent to jail for killing the lunatic, and then has to fight in a crazed fighting leauge set up by the warden. It's sort of like JCVD's version of SHAWSHANK, powerful but action packed. Definite must have for any action fan.",1232496000,,591,4.381818181818182
1923733,4,B0000DC152,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1.  Who is he?  Kyle, a foreign inmate in a corrupt Russian prison
2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged?  Odd for a JCVD flick, his avenging happens early when he unleashes his inner Samuel L. Jackson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Time-to-Kill/dp/B001ARNNC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Time to Kill</a>&nbsp;on a unibrowed assailant who previously gutted JCVD's wife
3.  Does he take his shirt off? Even in the shower scene JCVD doesn't strip.
4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No, but he almost has sex with a C-List actor.
5.  Is there a tournament? Yes.  Prisoners do battle and the warden's buddies bet on the outcome.
6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Absolutely.  And while in ""the hole"" he has plenty of time for pull-ups, push-ups, and leg-raises.
7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  For some reason JCVD is portrayed as frail, so he can't show his ability to do the splits.
8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  Oh, you know it!  What guy, who doesn't know how to fight, who's stuck in a prison death-match, wouldn't connect his heel bone to another prisoner's bone?
9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Warning!  Absolutely no flying kicks in this movie!
10.  Is his enemy unbeatable?  Neither his physical nor metaphorical enemy stands a chance.
11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  Just mental instability
12.  Does he win? It's JCMFVD!!!  He eventually owns the prison!

Essentially it's a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VI/dp/0671758837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VI</a>&nbsp;(where Kirk kicked the alien in the knee/balls), a classic episode of ""The A-Team"" where B.A. gets purposely put in a prison to uncover a warden-controlled inmate fighting scandal, a Russian version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B0000399WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>, the concubine scenes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/0783225768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>, the shower scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victory/dp/6304779666/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victory</a>, and one specific scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interview-with-the-Vampire/dp/B00004RFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interview with the Vampire</a>.  Just trust me.

The major characters seem like a collection of mental patient professional wrestlers.  One looks like Machine from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8MM/dp/B000BBOUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8MM</a>&nbsp;(mask included), but sounds like Jodie Foster from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nell/dp/B00013RC84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nell</a>.  Another is an aggressive rapist who looks like an L.A. cholo, and forcibly sodomizes a newbie who is only kept alive to get corn-holed by fight champs.  The final oddball is Inmate 451 (Lawrence Taylor), a psychotic arsonist (Get it?!  451!?!) who murders his cellmates and waxes poetic about the morality lessons of prison, survival, and humanity.

Without flying kicks and the splits, this one is less JCVD than most others.  However, it's an honest attempt by JCVD to play a role deeper than his norm.  Nonetheless, the movie incorporates the most enticing pieces of other action films, and delivers an interesting, albeit predictable plot.  By normal standards it's pretty ridiculous, but JCVD standards are different.  However, JCVD displays great range as a man who decays inside a deplorable situation, yet finds the willpower to eventually overcome adversity (especially during his completely insane moments).

Highly Recommended.",1223510400,4,4064,6.927165354330708
1923734,5,B0000DC152,"In his latest movies, Van Damme has shifted toward suspense and drama, which makes his characters more believable. In Hell is without a doubt one of the most tear jerking movies I have seen in a while due to Van Damme's powerful screen presence. In this movie, Van Damme slowly breaks down mentally until he is dirty with an unkept beard. In fact, he looses touch with reality to the point that even the movie's villians look at him horrified and shocked!! In Hell is more of a thriller than a mindless martial arts video. Van Damme is following in the footsteps of Jet LI, Jackie Chan, and my man Ho Chung Tao (AKA Bruce LI) who are great actors in their own right. One element that an above average actor must have is vulnerability.

That is my major gripe about Steven Seagal's movies. HE almost always looks the same-his hair, his wardrobe. But the big flaw of Seagal's movies is that his characters are ""perfect"", with no flaws that most people have at least to a minor extent. On the other hand, Van Damme is not afraid to play roles that show weakness or vulnerablities in human nature. Even Jet Li and Jackie Chan have played alcholics and other flawed personality traits in which they had to battle within themselves to finally defeat their enemies. In many films, Jet LI also makes amends to those in which he has wronged.
Van Damme is showing an ability to take risks with his acting by playing roles that show weaknesses in himself and his characters. Very moving, powerful performance by Van Damme!!
All Van Damme needs is a good director and producer to compliment his new vision of more ""realistic"" acting to continually deliver high quality movies to his fans.
Above average acting, good choreography, and a believable plot make this a suspense thriller well worth watching. I give this movie a 5 star rating.",1193097600,2,1825,4.632716049382716

I don't watch alot of fight movies by jean-claude, or by anyone as a matter of fact...but this one sticks with me. it's your typical tough guy fight movie, acting is okay, plot is pretty straightforward, as most action/fighthing movies are.

I gave this movie 4 stars because I believe it was well done, the action scenes made up for the dry plot! Definently a must see. Obviously, it's more of a guys movie. Yeah.",1164499200,3,499,4.423913043478261
1923736,4,B0000DC152,"As others have noted, both this and ""Wake of Death"" have shown a change in direction for Van Damme, choosing to delve more into complex roles, drama, and believable acting, rather than two dimensional fight movies. Not that I suspect we will be seeing him on the nomination list at the Oscars any time soon, but here again he turns in a credible performance. After being jailed for avenging his wifes murder, he is subjected to a brutal Eastern Block prison regime, where the dollar rules, the guards and warden are corrupt, and you sleep with one eye open. We see the gradual deterioration of an outwardly ""normal"" man, whose only means of survival is to become one of the cruel and violent inmates he has come to despise. The fight sequences are short, snappy, brutal and bloody (no box splits, or flying spinning back kicks here) and the viewer is immersed into the savage world of gangs, violence, and desperation. ""In Hell"" is an apt title, but the film has some surprising twists, and different outcome to what one might expect, and is well directed and well scripted throughout. Hardly an original story, but the European makeover adds another dimension to a standard prison flick of say ""Lock Up"" or many others. On the whole, I recommend this movie, and hope to see Van Damme continue to develop his characters in this way. I've always enjoyed his other, and often more aimless fight movies so felt a teeny bit agrieved at the lack of martial arts, but overall the movie is pretty darn good.

The warden also sets up a human cockfighting arena on the prison grounds where he has two prisoners fight (most of the time fight to the death) and he and his friends take bets on the winners.  Of course, JCVD sets out to make his way through this corrupt system, help his new prison friends, and get revenge for his wife's death.

The film is very dark, brutal, and bloody, but it is beautifully filmed.  There is one scene in particular when Kyle is thrown in ""the hole"" for misbehaving.  In that scene, after Kyle loses hope and tries to hang himself, a moth flies down from the window/rafters above him and the camera beautifully follows it down as it flutters toward Kyle, and then it lands on the handle of the spoon that is in his untouched bowl of gruel, as if to say, ""Eat. Get stronger, and you will be able to free yourself from this place.""  I know it sounds really corny, but it is really a lovely scene and not something that you typically see in JCVD films.

The DVD transfer is awesome.  Picture and sound quality are good and you get widescreen and fullscreen to choose from.

Definitely a movie to see, whether you like Van Damme or not.  It's a movie for anyone who has ever lost anyone they loved or had their life inexplicably turned upside down and had to fight to get things right.",1108598400,26,1844,4.4171597633136095
1923739,4,B0000DC152,"Let's face it, Van Damme has dished out some rather campy movies in the past 7 or so years.  However, there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this movie, along with the recent ""Wake of Death.""

""In Hell"" is a raw and darker film than his normal material.  Don't expect his stamped karate moves, because it doesn't take place during this flick.  Instead, we are treated with gritty, no-holds barred rumbles.

To top it off, Van Damme begins to show signs of some acting depth.  I'm not talking Oscar winner, but for Damme, this is probably the best work he has done that provides a sense of substance to his character.

A moment or two of akward cheesy-ness appears, but doesn't hamper the overall experience of the movie at all. Even if you are not a Van Damme fan, like I ""once"" was, you should give this flick a shot.  Don't expect a masterpiece and I believe you will be surprisingly surprised.",1107216000,5,921,4.408284023668639
1923740,4,B0000DC152,"I wrote off Jean-Claude years ago as a has been, but after seeing his impressive performance in IN HELL I might have to reevaluate The Muscles from Brussels.

Director Ringo Lam who's visited the prison genre twice before with the two classic PRISON ON FIRE films this time has Jean-Claude Van Damme as a steelworker in Bulgaria who is sentenced to life in prison without parole for avenging his wife's murder.

Mild mannered at first - you can tell by the way his shirt completely covers his muscles - Jean-Claude is eventually taken to the breaking point and forced to wear tank tops and release some Van Dammage on the crooked guards who pimp out the prettier prisoners and also run an illegal death match fighting league between some of the more bloodthirsty prisoners.

The fighting, not to mention that there's also a good story, is what really sets this movie apart from most Van Damme movies.  There's no flying and spinning around like a helicopter or exploding a stack of bricks with your big toe here.  Its all gritty realistic bloody knuckle street fighting.  The best example of that is at one point where Van Damme looks lost and has to turn around twice before he notices his opponent laying on the ground behind him.  Anybody who's been in a real fight knows how easy it is to get disoriented.

If Van Damme made more films like this he might get back in the movie theaters.",1107129600,7,1390,4.59919028340081

The movie starts off with Van Damme living a good life. He has a wife and a nice job. But soon everything starts to turn.

He calls his wife tells her hes coming home, but before he can come home she is attacked and killed by a thug. Then Van Damme races home to see her dead and catches the thug running off. tThey eventually catch the thug but free him of charges and thats when Van Damme takes matters into his own hands, its pretty funny, he just up and kills the guy.

So he his sentenced to life and prison and taken to a isloated location, but he doesnt realize they have fights there and he fights for the guards enjoyment.

I won't spoil this film to bad but it turns out to be a good film. But its very violent, i wouldnt recommend it to kids or anyone who doesn't like that stuff (Good thing im 18 but i was 16 when i watches this) 3 starts, descent film, descent story, descent Van Damme.",1105660800,,1017,4.07

1923744,4,B0000DC152,"I'm really sick of reading these negative 2 to 1 star reviews of this film by people who are pissed there are no high flying kicks. HELLO this is NOT a popcorn action film, it's more of a drama with REALISTIC depictions of prison fighting. It's like watching Keanu Reeves in ""Something's Gotta Give,"" a romantic comedy, then being pissed he wasn't busting out guns or kicking people like in the Matrix. Give the movie a bad rating because it fails in some way, NOT because you think it should have more chop-socky fighting.
All that aside, I was very surprised by this film. After the unwatchable ""Order"" and tear-jerkingly horrendous ""Derailed,"" I had lost hope for Van Damme, but ""In Hell"" is possibly one of his best films and one of the most effective prison dramas in the last few years. The cinematography and directing is great, thanks to Ringo Lam, a very underrated Hong Kong director, and the acting is very good as well. Van Damme has grown as an actor, and it shows in this film. Also look for a cameo by actor Paulo Tocha(Paco, the arrogant kickboxer from Bloodsport) as Victor.
Van Damme is Kyle, a man jailed in a Russian prison for killing the murderer of his wife. The wardens set up illegal fights inside the prison, and Van Damme struggles to survive inside while maintaining his humanity.
The fights are brutal and VERY realistic. They mirror real fights you would see in the streets or in UFC and other full contact events, which means elements of grappling and ground fighting are heavily utilized. This adds that much more to the realism of the film and shows Van Damme's versatility as a martial artist. In Derailed we saw some Ju-Jitsu and grappling from Van Damme, but he showcases these skills more heavily in this film.
Do not rent or buy this film if you are looking for mindless action and high flying split kicks like in other Van Damme movies, but DO rent or buy it if you want to see a gritty and well directed prison drama with some realistic and brutal fights.",1089504000,3,1995,4.559888579387187

1923750,4,B0000DC152,"Jean Claude Van Damme's Kyle LeBlanc character is interesting. He's apparently passionate enough to execute his wife's killer after the courts let the killer free. Yet he comes across as a very controlled, tightly wound person. One might wonder why he didn't try to follow the killer to a less obvious venue before pulling the trigger, but apparently Kyle is overcome with loss. As a result he gets sent to an Eastern Block prison where corruption and violence are the ways of the world. In this environment, Van Damme becomes a savage. In deed, the international release is called ""The Savage."" Van Damme is put in a cell with a violent prisoner known for killing his cellmates. As played by ex-football star Lawrence Taylor, this guy is huge, speaking little but constantly writing in his journals. He establishes a strange friendship with Kyle. Kyle meantime fights for sport in prison-sponsored to-the-death matches. Particularly brutal is the neck bite attack where Kyle is transformed into a crazed killer. Van Damme is convincing as borderline insane. During his lockdowns, a butterfly that seems to be the spiritual embodiment of his dead wife comes to comfort him as he sits next to the raw sewage streaming through his cell. The film is filled with the usual prison rape and countless manners of brutality. It leads to Kyle's final escape to freedom. I found the action to be gripping, although this is not really an action film as such. Marnie Alton is particularly creepy as Grey Lord. There is enough here to please most Van Damme fans. Enjoy!",1076976000,,1556,4.8977272727272725
1923751,3,B0000DC152,"Van Damme plays Kyle LeBlanc a foreigner currently residing in Russia.  His wife complains that he's always so busy working that they never get a chance to see eachother.  He promises her that this is only a temporary situation and that things will soon change.  He's right.  While talking to her on his cell phone during his drive home she is brutally attacked and targeted for rape.  Panic-stricken Kyle races home to save her, but he is too late.  His wife's attacker, however, is still in the house.  He jumps Kyle from behind, but the enraged huband fights back starting a rousing chase scene through the busy city streets.  Justice takes a turn for the worst through legalities as Kyle LeBlanc is the one sentenced to life imprisonment for taking the law into his own hands.  What follows is a dark and gruelling picture of life behind bars and prison corruption.
This is one of Van Dammes better pictures in recent years.  Director Ringo Lam is one of those directors who gives B quality pictures the same care he would give an A quality film.  He has a fine visual flair for storytelling as is evidenced throughout the film not only in moments of action (his car chases are always a highlight) but in subtle yet memorable varieties of camera placement (witness the scenes of solitary confinement which is a very small space yet he makes the absolute most and best of that space).  Van Damme has the capability to be one of the greats in this genre.  He has not only the looks and physical skills needed for action pictures, but also, as is shown in this picture, the ability to convey emotional feeling  without having to speak which, given the nature of action acting where words are often few and far between, is definitely a great plus.  Most of the action in this film for instance comes after long period's of time where Van Damme's character is watching, waiting, reflecting, suffering, and just simply trying to stay out of trouble.  These moments help make the action that inevitably does come after them all the more meaningful.  Ringo and Jean-Claude work well together and succeed in keeping audience interest during these quieter moments throughout the film, moments that exist primarily to set the stage up for what most people watch Van Damme movies for, the fights.  The fights in IN HELL are rough and raw.  All of the prison fighters are big and bulky convicts and as such there is an appropriate amount of wrestling and dirty kick-em-while-there-down tactics.  There's a minimal use of high spinning kicks (usually a Van Damme staple) and a lot of bare knuckle punches, but there are some nice wrestling takedowns to spice things up now and then.  The fact that the fighters here don't do anything really spectular is actually a plus.  The bare bone tactics seem more fitting to the theme of IN HELL where people who are treated like animals can become animals.
Now for the drawbacks.  Lawrence Taylor is given the role of narrator and has a tendency to be a little monotonous.  He does fine otherwise, but there's a lot of ineffectual narration throughout the movie.  The story is a little overfamiliar.  Even Van Damme himself has visited this territory before in DEATH WARRANT (prison is a good setting for Van Damme films though since that was another one of his better vehicles) where he played an undercover mountie looking into prison corruption.  Also, there's no central villain to root against during the climax.  While there are various baddies you come to hate, in the end it is the prison system itself that is the real villain of the piece.  This serves the film's purpose, but the final showdown becomes a little less personal and a little less involving without that one central figure.  We are given a few hated villains to root against throughout the movie, but they are only a part of the climax and not the climax itself.  All in all this is a good Van Damme picture and hopefully things will continue to swing up from here for him and his fans.",1076630400,4,3991,4.682926829268292

Van Damme is Kyle, an American working at a steel factory in Russia.  But when his wife got killed by a Russian mobster, Kyle himself ends up in a corrupt Russian prison, where any human dignity is deprived by the harsh rules of the place.
Surprisingly, in the film which means change of pace for him, Van Damme shows that he can act pretty well.  Kyle's pains of being humiliated by the prison wards are convincingly shown on the screen, and though the prison formula is nothing new, it still works to some extent, thanks to the credible production designs.
But still we miss his actions.  And in this film, there are lots of fighting scenes (mainly between the prisoners), but not the kind of the ones you see in his previous films like ""Quest"" or ""Timecop.""  They are bone-crunching type, like real bloody street fighting.  Ringo Lam obviously means realism here, perhaps going back to his roots in Hong Kong era.  But if you want escapism, like over-the-top actions Van Damme once showed in ""Maximum Risk"" or ""Timecop,"" you should avoid this one.
The supporting cast is just a typical list of stock characters, but among them, as laconic and philosophical 'No. 451,' Lawrence Taylor (ex-NFL footballer) shows good amount of presence.

Reading the plot outline to IN HELL, it would be easy to assume that it's just another typical Jean-Claude Van Damme fancy kicks, buttock shots, big guns festival. But much to my surprise, it wound up being a deep, gritty, poignant, intense and mature picture instead. Who knew? After the abysmal DERAILED (his worst film along with STREETFIGHTER), the Muscles from Brussels returns to top form in what is his best movie since REPLICANT and probably his strongest performance ever. This bitter pill punched hard with its unrestrained display of human ugliness, gripping symbolism and brutal violence which itself was dipped in philosophy and a sadness stricken aura. The films ""ace"" though was that it played it mainly as an engaging character-driven piece about one mans loss of his soul and his tortuous journey in prison to regain it. Thankfully, J-C was up to the task. I felt his characters pain, gulped a few times and was rooting for the main man the whole way.
Visually, the movie also came out a big winner with its strong showing of exquisite photography, stylish/creative shots and an intoxicating morbid atmosphere. Think David Fincher (SEVEN) like. And the fight sequences, you may ask? Well, we're treated to a different flavor than the usual Van Damme here. Gone are the ""show off"" aerial kicks that wouldn't hold up in a real fight and present is a more grounded style of fighting that reinforced the films realism and emotional impact. Sadly, parts of the script weren't up to par. Without the minor plot holes, the various prison movie cliches, the obvious devices to communicate substance and the tacky ""ghost"" appearance, the flick would've reached a higher level of quality. But in the end, I was still genuinely moved, impressed and highly entertained by IN HELL. It transcended its faults and affected me on many levels.

Derailed was easily the worst Van Damme movie ever made, not to mention the worst movie I've ever seen.  I feel somewhat bad about saying this, because I'm the biggest Van Damme fan (without being an obsessive nerd).
In Hell had better direction, editing, music, and overall production.  At first, I was worried because I had heard about the absence of Van Damme's high flying kicks.  Despite my skepticism, I bought the DVD on it's release date.  I watched it as soon as I got home, and to my surprise, the fight scenes were more than tolerable.  In fact, the fighting realism was impressive.
Besides his stupid haircut (not the same on the cover), the only complaint I have about In Hell, is that the structure of the plot was weak.  There was too much depressing emotion stuffed into act 2.  It kind of made the continuity of the film a tad bit awkward.
Although many of my friends criticize Van Damme's plummeting career, I convinced them watch the movie and they didn't hesitate to admit that it was pretty good.  If you're a faithful Van Damme fan, In Hell is a must see!

There are prisoners of all races and ethnic backgrounds.  There is even a prisoner in a wheelchair.  I definitely wouldn't recommend children viewing.

8000575,4,B0000DC152,"In Hell I thought was a really good movie. JCVD plays Kyle LeBlanc, a French-American man living and working in Russia with his American wife, who soon gets brutally murdered. Kyle is then sent to a Russian prison after he murders the man who killed his wife. The murderer gets off becasue he is from a priveleged family. Sot of a take off the movie ""A time to Kill"".  Prison is horrible, max security, dungeons for cells and isolation rooms. The warden and guards are all corrupt and the prisoners who have money get all the perks. The warden also sets up a human fighting on the prison grounds where he has two prisoners fight and he and his friends take bets on the winners. JCVD tries to stay moral in this corrupt prison but after getting sent to isolation 1 too many times, he starts to forget who he is. Lawrence Taylor is also in this movie and does a pretty decent acting role as one of the prisoners. The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars was I wish this movie would have let JCVD use more of his martial art skills",1442188800,,1037,4.2639593908629445
