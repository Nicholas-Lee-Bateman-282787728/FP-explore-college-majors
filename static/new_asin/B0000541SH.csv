1392134,1,B0000541SH,"I grew up in west Texas, have seen this bull in action and sadly I couldn't believe this video was SO poorly made.  Tuf's injury ride on Bodacious is NOT shown a single time!!  Only when he passed on Bo is shown and most of the tape is to music and sped up and duplicated from earlier scenes in the tape.  This tape is worth $5 at the most, nothing over that...  Let down in Dallas!!",1110758400,2,383,4.0
1392135,5,B0000541SH,"I'm one of the lucky fans that actually got to see Bodacious buck.  I saw Terry Don's Bodacious wreck in Houston and Tuff's NFR Bodacious smash up in Las Vegas.  I wouldn't care if this video were recorded on old newspaper  with a box of crayons.  As long as you can see the Great Bodacious ... any true bull riding fan will absolutely love this video.  And if you are not currently a fan, I can't think of a better video to watch than Bodacious Master of Disaster.  It's hard to imagine that anyone would give this video anything other than a strong 5 star rating.  It is one fantastic video and I highly recommend it.  Thanks for letting me rant.

1392136,1,B0000541SH,"WHEN WE FIRST WATCHED BODACIOUS WE WERE SIMPLY DUMB STRUCK....WE ARE SO DIAPPOINTED WITH IT THE CONTENT OF THE VHS TAPE.  WE WERE EXPECTING MUCH,MUCH MORE.  THE ADVERTISTMENTS WERE DECEIVING.  WE ARE COWBOYS AT HEART AND THIS TAPE LACKED THE EXCITEMENT, THE THRILL, AND THE ""EXPERIENCE"" OF BULL RIDING.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS  TAPE TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR THE UNEXPECTED HEART STOPPING ACTION, BULL RIDING ACHIEVES.",1057449600,,422,5.057971014492754
1392137,5,B0000541SH,"I rode bulls for over 10 years, and I raised bulls for over 20.  And there was never a bucking bull in all of rodeo history like Bodacious.  AND THIS VIDEO CAPTURES ALL THE EXCITEMENT AND INCREDIBLE ABILITY THAT BULL HAD!
This video has what could considered the greatest ride ever, when Tuff Hedeman scored 95 points on Bodacious.  And if that doesn't mean something to you ... well then you just don't understand bull riding.  Getting a 95 on Bodacious (out of a perfect 100) is like getting a 1000 on any other bull.  And back when Tuff made his ride, scores really meant something.
It seems to me that Bodacious, Master of Disaster presents all the rides that were captured on film or video ... from Terry Don West's smash up at the Houston Livestock Show all the way to Tuff's face smashing encounter at the National Finals.
If this video doesn't make you sit on the edge of your seat, either your watching something else ... or you have no pulse.  Make not mistake ... this is one RANK VIDEO!!",1046822400,5,999,4.4316939890710385
1392138,5,B0000541SH,The only thing better than this tape would be to see the rodeo live from atop a bull.  I saw Bodacious in competition three times. Each was incredibly exciting.  This tape captures all of that excitement and then some.  If you're a rodeo fan you need to own this.,978048000,5,263,4.326530612244898
1392139,5,B0000541SH,"I have never seen a more thrilling and exciting Bull than Bodacious.  This video captures all his energy and excitement and inspires our admiration for ""The  Master of Disaster"" and pity for the cowboys who ride him.  What a great video!!",976233600,6,238,4.7560975609756095

1392144,4,B0000541SH,Good DVD with great footage and interviews that show why this bull struck fear into many a rider. Good for the bull riding fans.,1375142400,,128,4.375
1392145,5,B0000541SH,"Bodacious is my all time favorite bull so to have this video of him to keep is truly great. I like the interviews with Sammy, Tuff, and Terry Don. I'm glad they captured that belly roll Bodacious had. It is so amazing to watch him twist his body the way he did. He always gave a good show.",1373241600,,289,4.0

1392155,3,B0000541SH,"This movie was pretty good but i wish they didn't cut the scenes off right before Bodacious ""did his work"" on the bull riders. that's what he was known for and they cut it out.  that disappointed me.",1223769600,,199,4.2368421052631575
1392156,1,B0000541SH,"I brought this video a while ago, to get a glimpse of the worlds dangerous bull.  Needless to say that this video is a dissapointment.  It shows the same videos over and over with tie dye colors trying to emphasize the ""viciousness"" of the bull. It didn't even show the infamous wreck of Bo and Tuff Hedeman.  It just bascially has clips of riders attempting Bo and some of his wrecks. Don't get me wrong the bull is impressive but who ever did this video needs to be cut.

 If you can try to find Bodacious on Fearless hosted by VS.  It was a great documentary about BO's rodeo career and how it tragically ended.",1213401600,,614,4.2956521739130435
1392157,5,B0000541SH,"We were all pleased with the vidoes and would encourage anyone that likes bull riding to get Bodacious, Master of Disaster. We liked the fact that the videos were here within a week and in good contidion.",1208736000,,204,4.54054054054054
1392158,5,B0000541SH,"Bodacious did so much for the sport of Bullriding. He put it on the map. There will never be another like him. His name is on top of the list of Bulls and will always be.

second DVD I received scratched by the same condition.

Thanks.",1168300800,,196,4.052631578947368
1392161,5,B0000541SH,this is my favorite bull i have ever seen that has been in the PBR. this video has interviews with riders and bullfighters and talked with them about the time he hurt tuff hedemen bad and all the cowboys said that they were scared of him. this isn't long but it is still good. bodacious is definatly a legend and his legacy in the PBR still lives on.,1151193600,,350,4.161764705882353
1392162,3,B0000541SH,"Too much repitition, saw the same crashes over and over.

 But BODACIOUS the bull did rock!",1141862400,,91,4.625
1392163,5,B0000541SH,"It was between spending the monie on this, or going to see Brokeback Mountain with the wife.  Let me just say I made the right choice.  Watching those guys try to ride Bodacious is much better than watching some strange Kansas City cow pokes.  There are plenty of cowboys singing soprano after a few seconds on Bodacious...oooowwwweeeeee!  Nobody could ride that bull, and now I  call my wife Bodacious.",1135987200,,403,4.782608695652174
1392164,1,B0000541SH,Very disappointed in the quality of the video.  Amaturish film of a truly great bull.  Definately not worth buying new.,1133222400,,119,4.9
