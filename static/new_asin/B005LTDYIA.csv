8478538,5,B005LTDYIA,Michael Muhney is one of my favorite actors and it was great to see him in this role. I really hope he has more solid roles in the future because he is as talented and deserving as anyone working in Hollywood. I thought the story was really funny and the whole thing was very well shot for an indie. I wouldnt be surprised if this won a few awards wherever it was screened. If you like original stories and appreciate good indie filmmaking I would definitely give Act Your Age a look. You won't be disappointed.,1424131200,,511,4.333333333333333
8478539,5,B005LTDYIA,"I have admired Michael Muhney who played Adam Newman on the American Soap Opera, ""The Young & The Restless,"" from 2009 to 2014. Muhney is really one of American's finest young actors.

This film is an independent and low budget character driven film. It is also Pat Morita's final film. Muhney plays a young actor who disguises himself as an old man to get a role.

He learns many valuable lessons from the experience and about himself. The DVD also shows the making and behind the scenes. Most of the time, the old man observes the others and listens to them.",1408492800,,560,4.534653465346534

8478541,5,B005LTDYIA,"Michael Muhney.  What more can you say about this talented man? His acting is perfection as always.  Even with the hilariously bad, old man makeup job that his character had, Muhney's portrayal was still able to make me laugh and cry.",1392940800,,234,4.682926829268292
8478542,5,B005LTDYIA,"Heartwarming movie starring and written by Michael Muhney, who does an outstanding job. Very enjoyable film that delivers on many levels. An out of work actor takes on the role of an elderly man and discovers the life's many truths. Great family movie.",1381622400,,252,4.883720930232558
8478543,5,B005LTDYIA,"My sister sent me the write-up about this movie in our hometown newspaper some time ago. I ran across it the other day, & thought what a nice gift it would be for self & family members. I was so excited to see that Amazon carried it.  I have always enjoyed Pat Morita. It's a good comedy, family show",1363478400,,300,4.084745762711864
8478544,5,B005LTDYIA,I had the honor to see this movie with my father. He is one of the seniors in the movie. He enjoyed every minute of it. Him and Pat got to be great friends.  The funny thing about the movie was one day while they were fliming my dad had his shirt inside out they finally notice it and had him put it on right. And then the next day Pat had his sweater on inside out and thats how they filmed.,1333756800,,392,3.7804878048780486
8478545,5,B005LTDYIA,"I must say that I was presently surprised by this movie. I had never heard of it before. The only reason I purchased it was because my favorite actor Michael Muhney from The Young and The Restless was in it. It was funny, sweet and sad at times but very heartwarming. Michael did an excellent job. He had to pretend to play an old man through most of the movie and he nailed it. I have no idea why this man isn't more famous than he is but he should be. He is just as good looking and as good an actor as any of them out there today. I say for the cost you're getting a really good movie.",1331769600,4,588,3.908333333333333
8478546,5,B005LTDYIA,"This movie is co-written by and stars Michael Muhney as an actor that can't seem to catch a break. After loosing out on a part ment for a much older actor he disguises himself as a senior citizen and checks into an old folks home. He learns first hand just what it is like being old. Great supporting cast including the final performance of Pat Morita and Bold and Beautiful cast member Andrienne Frantz. It gets a bit heavy handed in the middle of the movie as the portrayal of what seniors go through is a bit sad. Charming, upbeat ending sure to satisfy young and old alike, Act Your Age runs sure and steady all the way.",1328486400,2,624,4.296610169491525
