3524305,5,B001D2WU9S,"DOG GONE (2008) - PG  107 minutes

Dog Gone is basically, Home Alone in the woods. When 12 year old Owen rescues a dog from three men abusing the dog at a highway rest stop, he has no idea that the three are bumbling jewel thieves and that the dog is carrying five million dollars worth of stolen diamonds. Owen takes the dog back to his secret fort, high on a wooded ridge, a ridge that is also home to the Madman of the Mountain.  With a deadline approaching, the three jewel thieves search for Owen and finally grab him at his house. But Owen escapes back to his fort, which he has rigged with ingenious booby-traps and a wicked tennis-ball cannon named the Bully Buster.  The three dumb-as-rocks thieves, played with gusto by French Stewart, Kevin Farley and Kelly Perine, follow Owen to a final show-down.  After a hilarious battle, Owen and the dog, who Owen has named Diamond, are captured again. But Owen has unseen allies in two squirrels named Blabbermouth and Chatterbox and the mysterious, Madman on the Mountain.  In the end, the three jewel thieves wish theyd never been born. Dog Gone delivers all the hilarious and good-natured comedy that a classic family film should.",1381104000,9,1185,4.645933014354067

French stewart is in the movie, and plays a bad guy. If you liked him in third rock from the sun, you can watch him here too.

Since it only explains how I happened to purchase the DVD, this is a very wholesome family film that will appeal to most, if not all children and a significant portion of adults who have children. It's one of our six year old's favorite movies and she doesn't have any of the potential biases listed above. Nor does she enjoy anything other than animated features, so this was outside her comfort zone and a pleasant surprise for all. It's cute, funny and has a very uplifting message at the same time.

Some of the acting is a little cheesy, but it is a very enjoyable story about a boy who stumbles upon some criminals and the dog they are using as a part of their crime.  It reminded me a little of Home Alone at one point, where the boy outsmarts the burglars.  Everyone enjoyed it.",1500768000,2,358,4.235294117647059

8291466,2,B001D2WU9S,"Decent plot. Ok for kids. Bad acting with decent acting from lead kid. Terrible display of classism when comparing the ""great suburbs"" to the ""wretch of society trailer park"". Not one we will watch again.",1486166400,,204,4.857142857142857
