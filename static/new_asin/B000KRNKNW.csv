2697079,4,B000KRNKNW,"This DVD, like all of Jeanette's DVDs, is a good workout yet easy to follow. There was a little too much focus on the core exercises for me though. I'd prefer a better mix of arm and leg strengthening in addition to the ab work.",1238976000,6,228,4.088888888888889
2697080,5,B000KRNKNW,"This dvd is great for beginners.  Jeanette Jenkins is a wonderful trainer, she really explains how to do each move and keeps you motivated throughout the workout(just like in all the Hollywood Trainer dvds).  My core has never felt this amazing.",1217203200,5,245,4.951219512195122

8158925,4,B000KRNKNW,You really get your money's worth with this DVD. Jeanette Jenkins is a cry patient teacher who knows how to motivate and encourage you. If you are a beginner to Pilates this is the DVD for you she goes slow and gives detail instructions. Now if you are advanced this is still the DVD for you she offers advanced moves as well. As long as you use the DVD consistently you will see results.,1473379200,,388,4.256756756756757
8158926,4,B000KRNKNW,Excellent workout! Not as good as the 'Butt & Thigh Blaster' and the 'Abs Blast' but still a very awesome workout,1427068800,,113,4.428571428571429
8158927,2,B000KRNKNW,"purchased this for my wife, because she swore she needed it... have yet to see her doing pilates. if i would have know her true lack of motivation i would have saved my money and told her to watch pilates videos on youtube",1366070400,,222,4.186046511627907
8158928,3,B000KRNKNW,"I love Jeanette and I have many of her DVDs. I bought this because I wanted to start teaching Pilates as I am already a fitness trainer. However, this is definately for beginners or borderline intermediate. I did not find it that challenging.",1341360000,,242,4.651162790697675
8158929,4,B000KRNKNW,This video suffers from low production quality lets be honest but that said it does a good job of introducing you to pilates  and your going to feel the burn liked it so much got a copy for a friend.,1335830400,,199,3.975

8158931,5,B000KRNKNW,As always Jeanette delivers! I have several of her dvd's and I personally like her style. She is down to earth and easy to follow. Some of the other pilates dvd's I have used are boring. Jeanette does a good job of keeping it real and flowing without being boring. You get a super good core workout that you can feel afterwards. Pilates may seem slow but it makes your body feel so good and really works the abs!,1309737600,2,412,4.227848101265823
8158932,5,B000KRNKNW,"I love to do pilates. I have done a Denise Austin DVD, Suzanne Bowen and others as well. Jeanette is not to difficult but it is far from easy. I was pleasantly challenged by this dvd. A very good sculpting/ toning 45 min workout.",1297641600,3,229,4.2272727272727275
