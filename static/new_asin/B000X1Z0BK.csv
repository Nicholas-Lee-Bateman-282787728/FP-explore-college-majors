2997738,5,B000X1Z0BK,"I thoroughly enjoyed PARADISE TEXAS.  It brought back memories of going to the movies as a child.  It is a warm and wonderful family drama and just plain makes you feel good!  Though it is a few years old, it's a great one to get.  You'll find yourself watching it over and over again!  This one's definitely a keeper in my collection!",1335139200,,335,4.338709677419355
2997739,4,B000X1Z0BK,"I really enjoyed this film its a good family film.  seeing  a man  that gets down in his  life and to see a child change things all around him, including  his friends, family. This film leaves you feeling high in spirit and proud .",1274745600,,231,4.159090909090909
2997740,5,B000X1Z0BK,"I am not sure if this is a movie for kids or for adults; I suppose that should make it a good movie for the whole family to watch together.  There really are two stories here.  One is about an actor who is having family problems because he is away so much of the time on movie locations.  The other story is about a 12 year old boy who loves dancing and performing, but lives in a small Texas town where Future Farmers of America, 'cowboying' and school team sports are held in higher esteem than entertainers.  The actor and the young boy form a symbiotic relationship that helps put each of their problems in perspective and results in a satisfying ending to the movie.  There are a few swear words, but otherwise this is an entertaining and safe movie for family viewing.",1215475200,,774,4.384615384615385
2997741,5,B000X1Z0BK,"With Meredith Baxter in the cast, this was always going to be a likeable family film. The dance sequences were good - although it would have been nice to have had a couple more of them. (personal opinion). Generally well-acted. Keeping in mind that this is NOT a 'blockbuster' or some 'hyped-up' production costing mega-millions (nor does it try to be), it should simply be taken it face value... as a rather heart-warmin,  feel-good type of move with a message on family life that is not rammed down your throat. I particularly enjoyed the acting of the children in this production - Ben Estus in particular.
The copy I received had a few strange sound quirks (echoey clapping?) that gave it a slightly 'boxy' tone quality at times - but these are minor distractions. Perhaps, interestingly, I also felt keen to know more about the movie they were 'supposedly' filming as a part of the story. The plot of the imaginary movie seems to invite being taken further.",1202515200,,962,4.726190476190476

8226733,3,B000X1Z0BK,"I was in the mood for a nice feel good film and since I like some of the actors in this one, I decided to give it a go. It never really gets off the ground unfortunately. The first few minutes were ok but about a half hour or so in I found myself distracting easily and just sitting there waiting for it to be over. It had a nice message,  it was just too slow paced.  And although there were a few interesting scenes, the film was just blah for me overall.",1499644800,,457,3.903225806451613
8226734,1,B000X1Z0BK,"This is sooooo ham-handed. Comparing it to BILLY ELLIOT is like comparing a fart to a hurricane. The dialogue is leaden, scenes predictable, and the pathetic attempt to emulate BE cringe-worthy. It's CASABLANCA vs. FALCONCREST, the Boy Scouts vs Marines.",1497139200,,254,5.375
