8514315,1,B007C8GKB6,My first thought was that this was LARPers making a movie with their cell phones but that would be insulting to LARPers. A mostly silent movie with narration written in Vogon poetry.,1528761600,,182,4.71875
8514316,5,B007C8GKB6,"Imagine stepping through a portal that takes you to a world where magic is science; where ritual is a part of every day interaction; where a logic that is based on dream and nightmare rather than waking reality are the order of the day; and that may take give you a bit of clue to what Iconoclast is all about.

Here Gothic music video meets Bermanesque arthouse/underground cinema resulting in a visually stunning fever dream that entices with a feral sexuality. Beautifully shot on location New Zealand and - if I am not mistaken - some costumes and props provided by WETA (the same people who did the effects for the Lord of the Rings films and may more). This is Campbell's monomyth - the Hero's Journey - given form.

Viewers expecting standard three act hollywood paint by numbers fair aimed at the mindless hordes who'll watch anything that is being heavily advertised that week; who require that every action taken on screen be carefully explained to them as they've forgotten how to think, may be disappointed but for those looking for something to remove that nasty mainstream taste from their mouths; who enjoy cinema that challenges and rewards, are encouraged to step into the portal and let the Iconoclast experience wash over you.",1336176000,,1245,4.813084112149533
8514317,1,B007C8GKB6,"This was absolutely horrible.  I really had high hopes, but it just consists of a chick walking around dressed like xena warrior princess perfoming obscure ritual dances and ceremonies that aren't explained and make no sense at all, with a weirdo storyline that completely failed to keep my interest - barely audible all the while.",1334448000,,331,5.0181818181818185
8514318,4,B007C8GKB6,"I had a chance to see a copy of this movie right as it was being released, showing it to a group of my friends who were over for dinner.  The movie has a few things that could be critiqued (and probably would have been done differently on a movie with a bigger budget?)  Overall, we all really enjoyed this one.  It's got hot visuals, sexy actors, dramatic building tension, and did I mention sexy actors artistically dripping in blood?

I'm totally visualizing this movie playing on the back wall/in the background of many a Gothic dance club.

Worth the price and recommended.",1330905600,4,578,4.572815533980583
