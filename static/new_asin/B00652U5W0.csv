8493234,2,B00652U5W0,"This DVD runs a total of 3 hours and 35 minutes. It has 4 programs in it: Amazing Earth, What Lies Beneath, Earth 2100: Wild weather Ahead, Earth the Sequel. The programs blend together. The photography is very good and there are subtitles in English.
Basically the film shows and tells how natural forces affect the earth. It goes back in history to mention meteor hits and Pompeii and how volcanoes are formed and the movements of earthquakes are covered.

There is just a smoothness messing. Somehow, it seems as if the ideas and facts are just lumped together; even the programs run together in viewing.  The narrator tells how the ocean level is rising and shows islands where the population will have to move by 2009; but nothing is told where the people went or what became of them - and the film has a date of 2012.
The program ends abruptly as if their time to show their film ran out. The program could have been so much better than what this shows.",1350172800,5,959,4.474285714285714
