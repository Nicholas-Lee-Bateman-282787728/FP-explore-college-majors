8249766,5,B0013CADXI,"Dr. R.C. Sproul takes viewers on a comprehensive overview of biblical history in this timeless series,  ""From Dust to Glory."" Taking almost every book in the Bible in chronological order, he outlines the major themes and ideas of the Bible, the history of the nation of Israel, and the applications to both Judaism and Christianity. His solid theology is mixed with relevant anecdotes and interspersed with important vocabulary to enhance any person's understanding of the Bible in a manner that holds the attention. Highly recommended.

Note: This series covers the entire Bible. Buyers should be aware, however, that the volume I purchased only contains the New Testament section. I had seen the Old Testament episodes on TV, and wanted the entire set for my video collection. Purchasing both volumes would be somewhat pricey, and I was disappointed the seller did not indicate it was one volume only.",1373241600,9,903,5.136054421768708
