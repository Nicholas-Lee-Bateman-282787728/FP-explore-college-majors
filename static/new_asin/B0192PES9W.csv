7561120,3,B0192PES9W,Fun movie with MANY famous Korean actors/actresses thrown in...story line is rather linear and predictable.,1469577600,,107,6.2
7561121,3,B0192PES9W,Violent charged movie story of police against a corrupt and cruel rich son of a chaebol family. I liked the two main actors but overacted their roles. There are some interesting quirky characters to add humor to the story.,1468627200,,222,4.717948717948718
7561122,5,B0192PES9W,"Warning: If you are not a native Korean or well ""influenced"" by Korean culture, you will not be able to fully appreciate how amazing this movie is.
It will still be a 3 / 4 star rated movie, but you need to understand that the mixture of jokes, action, and underdog story is PERFECTLY balanced to the current Korean drama hype.

It manipulates exactly what all the Korean citizens are looking for, both culturally and socially, in current dramas and movies.
Also, it is incredibly satisfying to a Korean population that has grown increasingly bitter and resentful towards the super conglomerates (Samsung, SKT, etc.) that basically control Korea.

To get a basic idea of how this movie feels... imagine terrorists burning down the White House, then a patriotic movie is released of a cool guy beating down terrorists.
Yes, it's an exaggeration, but it helps to show how well this movie plays on the desires of the audience.",1462752000,6,923,4.8354430379746836
7561123,3,B0192PES9W,"Director Ryoo Seung-wans name is familiar to fans of Korean cinema, having made a number of action thrillers the past two decades. Veteran represents his return to lighter action fare after a series of darker and more intense films. Pairing with long-time collaborator Jung Doo-hong, one of Koreas best action choreographers, Ryoo Seung-wan delivers a police thriller with some action and light laughs starring Hwang Jeong-min. The slickly made film is a crowdpleaser that has dominated the Korean box office.

An experienced detective in Seoul that truly believes in bringing criminals to justice, Seo Do-Cheol (Hwang Jeong-min) is an occasionally reckless loose cannon that gets the job done when taking down criminals. Veteran goes out of its way to paint him as an ordinary but effective cop, right down to a loving wife that nags him and a boss that likes to bust his chops. After a lightly funny police raid patterned after Jackie Chans better slapstick work, the cop learns of a friend that has inexplicably attempted suicide. Little does Seo know the investigation will draw him into a conflict with powerful corporate forces in Korea.

One of the most successful Korean movies ever at the box office, Veterans success is surprising and feels like the right movie being released at the right time. Surprisingly light on action despite a few fun scenes, the thriller runs far too long for its predictable tale of a rogue cop overcoming all obstacles in taking down a powerful criminal. I guess its nice mix of light action and comedic relief is vaguely reminiscent of Jackie Chans better movies, but the narrative drags at over two hours. There is little reason why this movie should have run longer than 90 minutes.

Veteran is a reasonably entertaining two hours with tightly crafted action sequences and likable primary characters. This isn't quite the white-knuckled action thriller it has been touted by marketing but generally satisfies with a blend of predictable drama and solid comedy. Clearly derivative of better cop thrillers but in some aspects very enjoyable.

7561185,5,B0192PES9W,This movie is fantabulous! I saw Yoo Ah In in Secret Affair and The Throne and had to see him in this just to see his range. He did not disappoint me. This young man is really talented! Not just a pretty face.,1509580800,,209,3.883720930232558

When I saw it was for region A, I figured ""no problem, I have a region free PS4!"", as always (I've watched lots of movies from Asia, the US, and Europe), and didn't expect the movie to have a region block in it that would cause it not to work even on a region free player...Happened with two other movies I bought as well, all from the same publishing company...Now I know to avoid anything from those jerks...",1501632000,,470,4.233333333333333

7561191,3,B0192PES9W,"Hwang Jung-min is wonderful, as usual. Just great. The supporting cast is delightful. Yoo Ah-in is passable, but no more than that. What I am finding in Ryoo Seung-won's films, of late, is a narrative disregard for women, a blithe acceptance of violence against women, and generally excessive amounts of physical pain and degradation. (More can sometimes be said, more poignantly, with less.) Granted, the fight scenes are extraordinarily well-choreographed and visually-attuned, but the final showdown is painful to watch. Beneath Hwang Jung-min's and others' stellar acting and the fighting lies...not a lot. The plot is really pretty sparse and the script leaves many unanswered questions (along the lines of retribution, for instance, or whether particular characters died or not).

That Yoo Ah-in's character is drug-addicted and -addled becomes an excuse for Ryoo Seung-won to never develop fuller reasons for the character's psychopathy, but not a reason to have the police target, say, a larger drug ring. A couple of snorts of cocaine, an acknowledgment that he isn't close with his relatives, and the blood starts flying. Generally, just weak writing. The violence perpetrated by Yoo Ah-in's character against women is also merely part of the set piece. At no point is the character indicted for his actions against his female counterparts; in no instance is he further condemned or does his pending punishment increase. True, Yoo Ah-in's character also assaults and maims male characters; these injustices inspire the ire of Hwang Jung-min's character, not the acts of violence against women.

The final result is a movie that has some marvelous components, but due to the poor writing and misogynistic viewpoint of its screenwriter/director, the end product falls flat.",1482969600,,1781,5.379928315412187

8743609,4,B0192PES9W,"We watch a lot of Korean movies and they always seem to find something new to add to make it interesting. The chase in the shipping container yard at the docks was excellent and from there on we were hooked. It does get a little slapstick at times but the humor works and this one was pretty entertaining beginning to end. If you like police drama, action and some mystery you shouldnt be disappointed. The downside is that you have to use Closed Captions because there are no English sub-titles in the streaming version and, for the most part, they were pretty good.",1522627200,,567,4.514563106796117
8743610,5,B0192PES9W,Lots of well known Korean stars made the movie fun and entertaining.  The main actor is super famous in Korea!,1518825600,,110,4.5
8743611,4,B0192PES9W,"Another excellent action / comedy out of South Korea...  yes, there are subtitles.  If you don't like subtitles, just skip this now.  I have no problem with them, and they looked fine to me while streaming the movie.

There is almost nothing bad I can say about this movie.  The action scenes were fantastic...  They managed to get in some humor, both in dialogue and in slap stick style Jacky Chan comedy mishaps.  The camera work, audio, and special effects were all done really well.

The story is great, and it's easy to relate / sympathize with the main protagonist and a few of his friends...  so, plenty of suspense.

If you don't mind subtitles, I HIGHLY recommend this flick.  The only reason I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5, is because I reserve 5 stars for truly epic films which I would probably watch again within a couple days.  I will likely watch this movie again in the future, but not right away...",1517011200,5,920,4.509090909090909
