8654297,2,B004JFGT6Q,"This would have been a great dvd of lots of old tv theme songs,However the picture quality is very poor. The picture pixelates and breaks up a lot. I've seen better quality on vhs tapes that have been recorded from a tape to a tape several times over. The sound quality is good. I would not buy it again!",1304294400,,304,4.169491525423729
