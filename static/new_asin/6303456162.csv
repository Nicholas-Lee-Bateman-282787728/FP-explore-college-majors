The story, there is none, at least that bears any resemblence to anything good.  It supposvly revolves around a guy who wears pink and has big muscles who has a spiked haired girl friend and an identical twin who wears black and has big muscles.  The twins have a nuclear powered hand trick which is the ultimate power source.  Also the twins are 3 years old.
THis is so bad I can't even continue this review, I gave this away, I didn't even sell it, I gave it away.  The person who now has it said the same thing, he never finished it either.  IT's that bad.",1012262400,,744,4.131944444444445
7848742,2,6303456162,This second sequel to Class of nuke em high is a disappointment. CONEH 3 has very little to do with the original and if you've seen the Toxic Avenger sequels you'll find that this is more like the second than the first. The film picks up exactly where the second ended and even borrows scenes from the second in fact the begining is just a recap of the second. This film is really bad and I would have rated it lower but after viewing it again I found it to be a little better. If you loved the first you won't like this that much and if you don't like Troma then you will want to destroy this tape.,1008028800,,599,4.042016806722689
7848743,1,6303456162,"The same reporter (with the same B. O. problem, which is getting REALLY old) has a son (who looks exactly like him) and the son later discovers that he has a twin brother who has been raised into the ways of evil.  Pretty much just like the last with the same tired sickening jokes and  unspeakably gross flashbacks. Stay far away from this one.",945820800,,345,4.375
