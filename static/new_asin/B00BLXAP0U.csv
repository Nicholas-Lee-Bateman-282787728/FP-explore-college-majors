8570671,1,B00BLXAP0U,"The intro played, but the rest of the CD didn't.  And it was not sealed...all Kari Mecca CDs usually are wrapped, this one wasn't.  Return was accepted and refunded, but it was wasteful of my time to get merchandise that was not new.",1390262400,3,233,4.395348837209302
8570672,2,B00BLXAP0U,"i was very disappointed in this DVD.  After being very excited after the release of the Whimsey sewing books, and taking one of Kari's classes, i expected a great deal more from this very expensive DVD.  First of all, the DVD is poorly made.  After launch I couldn't get it to go past the title page.  I had to go click on the menu option in the upper right corner (after taking it out of full screen mode) and then try to get it to launch the first chapter.  That marginally worked but I got better results by launching windows explorer and right clicking on the DVD and selecting Play.  Seems like a ridiculous amount of work just to get the DVD going.  While Kari's instructions are very good and valuable the absence of any patterns left me feeling very ripped off.  But that seems to be the way of all of Kari's merchandizing: if you buy a kit from her you have to buy the pattern separately.  Don't even get me started on the outrageous cost of her 'Whimsy' sticks.  Given the poor quality of the product, the disappointing lack of patterns and my general disappointment I will be returning the DVD for a refund.",1382659200,6,1118,4.383495145631068
