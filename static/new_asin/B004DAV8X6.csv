8425077,4,B004DAV8X6,I don't know why people don't like this. Obviously this is the Hindi remake of Back to the Future. I found it entertaining.,1521417600,,123,4.391304347826087
8425078,5,B004DAV8X6,"Worth every minute. One of the most funny Bollywood movie of all times. I have watched it already ten times after getting the DVD. Akshay Kumar Ash and the overall script is superb. Anybody who loves Bollywood - would live this movie. Especially, the 70s, 80s and 90s-born crowd would love it..
Totally great movie - one of the best.. I am very happy with my purchase of this DVD.",1490140800,,380,4.442857142857143
8425079,5,B004DAV8X6,Love Akshay Kumar. Funny movie with a moral to the story. Time travel back to last for the don to help parents have a love marriage while still trying to make sure it is born! Must see...,1477872000,,187,4.081081081081081

Colorful, cute, back to the past to correct the future story.",1453680000,,107,5.0
8425083,2,B004DAV8X6,"Unfortunately, the worst Aishwarya Rai (Bachchan) movie I've seen. Not her fault in her role, per se; though she's not given much scope. But try as I may I cannot warm to Akshay, and he does nothing whatever here to warrant a change in my feeling. Beyond the expected colour, after seeing it about 6 weeks ago, I can remember absolutely nothing about it I liked. Attention-killing, head-throbbingly dull and time wasting.",1431388800,,421,4.861111111111111
8425084,4,B004DAV8X6,It was fun to see my first sci-fi Bollywood film.  The acting and music is excellent.  Thank you for providing it.,1397692800,,114,4.380952380952381
8425085,2,B004DAV8X6,"Based on a famous Gujarati play of the same name, ACTION REPLAYY also sees the reunion of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Akshay Kumar after KHAKEE. Also, Vipul Shah is back with his blue-eyed boy Akshay after AANKHEN, WAQT and NAMASTEY LONDON.

The plot is inspired from Robert Zemeckis' BACK TO THE FUTURE, a time-travel comedy. Bunty (Aditya Roy Kapoor) loves his girlfriend Tanya (Sudeepa Singh) but doesn't want to marry her. Why? Because of his parents, Kishen (Akshay Kumar) and Mala (Aishwarya Rai). He has seen them quarrelling all through their married life. One day, Tanya's grandfather, Professor Anthony Gonsalves (Randhir Kapoor), gives him the choice to either marry Tanya or forget her forever. Using Professor's time machine, he transports himself to the 70s and plans to rewrite his parents' destiny.

If you're expecting a fun ride with loads of gags coupled with romance and drama, you are in for a disappointment. There are just a few smile-inducing moments in this otherwise lackadaisical film.",1300579200,3,1011,5.158536585365853
8425086,2,B004DAV8X6,"This movie has an unbelievable story which is also quite ridiculous. The son is allergic to marriage because his parents are constantly quarrelling. The parents are Aishwarya Rai and Akshay Kumar, the main role players.

Enter Randhir Kapoor, the Professor. He has built a flying machine which has broken the ""sound barrier"" and which will enable time travel. The son is dating his daughter. He decides to time travel back to straighten out his parents before they got married. What follows is an endless series of silly and ridiculous episodes as the son goes about establishing male dominance for his father.

All's well that ends well. The movie has one popular song. Neither Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai nor Om Puri and Kirron Kher, who are otherwise good actors, could enliven such a dead story. This movie is definitely avoidable.",1297641600,2,838,4.978571428571429
