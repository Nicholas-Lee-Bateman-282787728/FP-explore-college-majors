8737291,5,B016UOQFLC,WOW 111. What a story. I have always read about this race for years but never really understood what the terrain was like nor the history behind the race.. Of course with Alain De Cadenet doing the directing and doing the commentary it was bound to turnout GREAT I have followed Alain for years with his various programs and they are all outstanding. Of course you have to be a car nut and into all kinds of racing to really appreciate ths production. WELL DONE!!,1494720000,,463,4.458823529411765
