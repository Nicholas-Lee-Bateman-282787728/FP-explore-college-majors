8025123,5,B0002ABU2U,"A fantastic story of Einstein, even though I knew most of it already.  I LOVED watching him wearing the handkerchief (with the corners tied) on his head.  I've heard that people have looked for that picture.",1419379200,2,207,4.722222222222222

8025125,5,B0002ABU2U,"I like learning about the late professor Einstien.
If you want to learn more about the man who changed our world this video shall help.
I recommend this video for adults to children.",1388707200,4,182,4.545454545454546
8025126,2,B0002ABU2U,"I am usually enjoy, and am impressed, by Nova presentations, but this is an exception.  Speaking generally, Nova producers are possibly better at handling the minutia, or smaller subjects, in finer and more sophisticated ways than they do the large ones.  Here with Albert Einstein we have a large topic: the life and work of one of the most prominent physicists of the 20th century.

  The issues were several, here.  Principally, it did not delve deeply into Einstein's theories, or really even much attempt to.  It largely concerned his private life, as opposed to his theoretical work and the consequent trouble he had getting his ideas accepted by the intellectual community.  (The latter is of important interest to philosophers.)  Additionally, during the limited presentation of his views, the film may have at times joggled the thoughts of the mature Einstein, with his younger self, for the sake of simplicity.  An actor was also featured that at times would play the role of Einstein as an elderly man: some may like this, some not, but I thought it came off as heavy-handed.

  Thus, this Nova special focused much more so on the private life of the man, and even trying to present a picture of what he would be like if you met him in person.  One final issue was that I thought it was overlong, and rather poorly organized.  The film was therefore quite unsatisfactory, and considering it was Nova, a serious disappointment.  I rather recommend the History channel presentation of his life (made circa 2005) if you are interested in Einstein's life, and the acceptance of his theories; and, Peter Ustinov's superb late 1970s PBS special, ""Einstein's Universe"", for the science itself.",1357257600,7,1697,4.943462897526501
8025127,5,B0002ABU2U,"This documentary by NOVA is excellent.  It explores Einstein's amazing work in physics and spices it with human interest stories about this fascinating man.

Einstein made major breakthroughs in relativity, gravity, space, time, matter and energy.  For the final decades of his life, Einstein worked on a unified field theory to explain and relate the physical world of the very large and of the very small (quantum mechanics).  He never discovered a satisfactory answer to a theory how everything behaves in the physical universe.  But, he laid much of the groundwork that many physicists work on today.  His name is synonymous with genius!

""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.""--Albert Einstein

8025128,5,B0002ABU2U,"My students found this DVD not only informative, but it shed a new light on this fascinating man. As we learned about his life, there were scenes which focussed on his ideas of relativity - a good visual learning tool.  However, it was the 'man' behind these brilliant ideas which captivated my students.  Einstein is revealed as an 'ordinary' person who cared for no-one but his passion for his work. Despite his scientific contributions which rocked the world, he failed as a husband and father (quite disappointing).  A good video if one wants to really get to see who Einstein really was.",1199232000,14,592,4.784313725490196
8025129,3,B0002ABU2U,"Unlike the offensive Biography DVD, this product makes some small effort to come to grips with relativity, but could have done much more.  The few animated examples (train and lightning, man in falling elevator) could have been better executed and better explained.  The actor portraying Einstein did a reasonable job, but why the German accent?",1127520000,7,345,5.254545454545455
