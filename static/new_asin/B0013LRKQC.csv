3116218,5,B0013LRKQC,"Play them this. It'll blow their minds. The Original Not Ready for Prime Time Players are at their peak. The episode with Steve Martin singing ""King Tut"" may be the single best episode of SNL ever. Leaves even the best SNL casts of the last 15 years in the dust.",1207094400,,262,4.26
3116219,5,B0013LRKQC,"This season still features the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players - John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, Garrett Morris,Jane Curtin and Laraine Newman.  Plus newcomer Bill Murray.

When SNL (at this time it was NBC's Saturday Night Live) first came on it changed the variety format from skits and musical numbers to what is now called sketch comedy with music from popular and upcoming rock groups.  Each episode was ""hosted"" by an actor who was usually promoting their new film.

Each show had an opening skit that end with ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night"", the credits followed, then the guest host would come out do some sort of monologue.  This would fade into either an original SNL cast commercial (remember The Taste Bud's for Budweiser) or a parody of a commercial.  Skit, musical guest, skit, Weekend Update, skit, second musical number, skit and closing.

The show had a number of reoccuring skits, which were rotated to keep them fresh (unlike today when they get an idea they flog it to death!).  The best were Two Wild and Crazy Guys (Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd), the coneheads (Aykroyd, Jane Curtin and Lorraine Newman), Samuari ""Whatever"" (John Belushi), the Killer Bees (cast).

If you have not seen the original episodes uncut then you will understand why this show was so revolutionary.  And remember that at this time people had to stay up to watch the show ""Live"" as most people did not own VCR's in 1977.  So it became a fashionable for groups of young people to have parties and watch the show.

The following are this season's hosts and musical guests:

Steve Martin / Jackson Browne (Running on Empty and The Pretender)

Madeline Kahn / Taj Mahal (Queen Bee) - guest performer Dame Edna Everedge

Hugh Heffner / Libby Titus (Fool That I Am)

Charles Grodin / Paul Simon and The Persuaders (Slip Sliding Away and You're Kind) - Coneheads, Samuai Dry Cleaner, Killer Bees.  Art Garfunkel appears in a skit with Grodin and Simon

Ray Charles and the Raylettes (I Can See Clearly Now, What I'd Say and Hit The Road Jack)- Ray does a parody of Andre Agassi's Cannon commercial.

Buck Henry / Leon Redbone (Champagne Charlie and Please Don't Talk About Me When I Am Gone) - Samurai Psychiatrist

Mary Kay Place / Willie Nelson (Whiskey River, Blue Eye's Crying in the Rain and Something to Brag About) - with appearance by Andy Kaufman

Mrs. Miskel Spillman (Anyone Can Host winner) / Elvis Costello (Watching the Detectives)

Steve Martin / The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (On the Looose with the Blues) & Randy Newman (Short People and Rider on the Rain) - Two Wild and Crazy Guys, Coneheads

Robert Klien / Bonnie Raitt (Runaway and Give It All Up or Let Me Go) - Lobsters Attack the Show

Chevy Chase / Billy Joel (Only the Good Die Young and Just the Way You Are) - Chevy as Ford

O.J. Simpson / Ashford and Simpson (So, So Satisfied and Don't Cost You Nothing) - Samurai Night Fever, Hertz

Art Garfunkel (All I Know, Scarsburough Fair and Crying in My Sleep)/ Stephen Bishop (On & On)

Jill Claburgh / Eddie Money (Two Tickets to Paradise and Baby Hold On) - Coneheads

Christopher Lee / Meatloaf (All Rewed Up & No Place to Go and Two Out of Three Ain't Bad) - appearance by Richard Belzer

Michael Sarrizin / Keith Jarrett - La Dolce Gilda

Steve Martin (again!) / The Blues Brothers (Hey Bartender and I Don't Know) - Two Wild and Crazy Guys, Dancing in the Dark (Steve and Gilda classic), King Tut

Richard Deryfuss / Jimmy Buffett (Son of a Sailor) & Gary Tigerman (White Oaxacan Moon)

Buck Henry / Sun Ra (Space is the Place and Space Loneliness) - Samurai TV Repairman, Mr. Mike

This is when the show was at its zenith and is still funny today.",1203292800,106,3798,4.586053412462908

We both found that the jokes relating to current news headlines from back in the day aren't that amusing to us...Perhaps because those ""news stories"" are not as fresh in our minds these days, I'm not sure?  But the classic skits (like Steve Martin's ""King Tut"") are still a riot.  All in all we laughed out loud at some of this and ended up fast forwarding on other parts.  I guess it all depends on your personal taste, but all in all, a true Saturday Night Live fan should enjoy this.",1453248000,,605,4.327433628318584

3116472,5,B0013LRKQC,"Running Time: approximately 1 hour, ten minutes per weekly episode
Perceived Running Time: 40 minutes (depending on the episode)

Replay-ability: high
Estimated Durability: 4 generations+
Audience: Wide. Fifth grade and up (some mildly dirty jokes).

Why:
This is one of the best and most entertaining time-windows into the late 70's you'll ever find. It features some of the funniest, most talented performers, at their height, hungry, raw and energetic. This is about the time when they'd polished off the rougher edges, but before the show became tiresome formulaic. Watching each episode in it's entirety is important as each one had an overall rhythm and flow like a good music album or symphony. My 6th grader has found a cornucopia of inspiration from this trove of forgotten excellence in performance and modern vaudeville. I predict that the material herein will remain fresh and highly entertaining long-after my generation is dead and gone. The Charles Grodin episode alone was hysterical from beginning to end, in a weirdly post-modern way. My son's watched that single week several times over.

Without the commercials, the episodes fly by. They can also be enjoyed in chapters if you need a some quick entertainment.

This is also a great time capsule of Americana, reflecting the mind and matters of the late 70's. If you want to get a cultural feel for that time, or share it with someone else, this is better than any history book. While it does mock timely events and make timely references, it does not rely on them to the point of alienating subsequent generations; about as much as classic Loony Tunes or Monty Python.

In addition to the comedy, it also features some very candid performances by famous musicians, also in their early prime.

Why not:
The jokes do get a little dirty here and there; it is a late-night product of the swinger culture of NYC. It would be considered racy even by today's broadcast standards. It periodically makes references to people and events that are long-forgotten, even by those of us who were active in those days. The most intolerant youth might call it dated, and the pacing is of course slower than modern comedy. The skits that do rely too heavily on the forgotten are easily skipped.

Further, the quality is not strictly consistent. Some ""weeks"" are funnier/better than others. Some skits soar while some bomb. But even the weakest weeks are quite entertaining. But this is the result of it's organic nature. As it grew in consistency in the 80's, it lost genius.

Kudos:
Raw, hungry, fresh, energetic talent.

Demerits:
Occasional out-dated references.
A blu-ray edition would be appreciated with more special features, bookmarks and the ability to play only the musical segments.

Notes:
You might be given to buy one of the ""Best Of"" volumes, but you'd be cheating yourself. Again, each week had a flow. At the risk of comparing SNL with immortal classics, it would be like attending a Best Of Shakespeare. It would be like only watching the highlights of a sporting event. Too much of the overall experience is lost. Several youth I know never ""got"" the classic SNL until they sat down and watched complete episodes.

Verdict: Don't bore younger people with your old-people stories of how great the 70's used to be. Show them some of this and then just answer their questions.",1367712000,4,3345,4.934163701067615

3116600,5,B0013LRKQC,"SNL was a very different show in its first five years from the show it would become. It did not pander to popular or dumbed-down tastes, nor was it an excuse for a modestly talented performer to plug their latest star vehicle. The show's third season displayed multiple talents reaching their peak, and the remarkable emergence of Bill Murray as a major comic actor. The musical guests are a truly colorful lot, rather than the flavor-of-the-week acts that are booked today. Most of all, this was the final year that the writing was shaped by the brilliant Michael O'Donoghue and his hilariously dark perspective. The Robert Klein episode concludes with Mr. Mike's elaborate spoof of D-grade monster movies, ""Attack of the Atomic Lobsters,"" which manages to send up Roger Corman, Orson Welles's ""War of the Worlds,"" and the radio broadcast of the Hindenburg disaster, all at the same time. You'll never see anything as wild or risky as this on network TV again. This was also the year of the episode that many on the show considered their best ever, the April 1978 show hosted by Steve Martin. SNL defined comedy for at least a generation.

The one with Christopher Lee and guest Meat Loaf is one where I actually learned the whole show by heart, as I taped it (audio cassette) the night of March 25, 1978.  Remember when Lee plays Mr. Death and apologizes to Lorraine for Tippy?  How 'bout when Bill Murray does the Oscar predictions (they'll give it to Richard Burton to make up for losing Liz Taylor).  Then there's the Elvis Costello  one on Dec. 17, '77, where he stops the song ""Less than Zero"" and plays ""Radio Radio"" instead.
  Jill Clayburgh hosts one, Steve Martin, the Blues Brothers perform, and you know the rest.  How could the show have risen to such a high standard here, and how did the show with the same name fall to such a low level after the original cast left?

3116605,5,B0013LRKQC,"Many reviewers say these early Saturday Night Live seasons are products of their times, that they aren't nearly as funny today as we all thought they were back then. To that I say dude, what have you been smokin'? Yes, I was one of those who watched these shows in college, usually at a party where everyone was, shall we say, already in a purple haze. But thinking that's what made these shows great is simply revisionist history.

Sure there are some dated cultural jokes, a few lame musical guests and an occasional skit that falls flat. However, each episode is still, for the most part, solidly entertaining. As I sat down with these discs today partaking of nothing stronger than a few Diet Cokes, what I noticed is just how watchable these shows still are. Even when not at their best, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin and the others each did at least interesting work, and always in their own personal style. What resulted was a true comedy variety show, a witty take on middlebrow culture that though edgy at times, rarely takes a cheap shot or wallows in the gutter.

Originally 90 minutes long with commercial breaks, each commercial-free episode here runs between 66 and 68 minutes.

This third season may be the best in Saturday Night's history. Most every show includes at least one of SNL's most famous recurring skits as well as some hilarious forgotten moments. For example, the first show includes Lorne Michaels upping his offer to the Beatles from $3,000 to $3,200 and a commercial parody for the Kromega III, ""a watch so complex it takes two people to make it work."" The second episode tosses in an ad for Swill (""the water that's dredged from Lake Erie""), a great skit with Gilda and host Madeline Kahn as two drunken single girls who discuss everything from dates who endlessly drone on about ""The Patty Duke Show"" to how to lie on a bed ""so the fat on your thighs isn't spread out,"" and an ad-libbed chat between Kahn and Dame Edna (English comedian Barry Humphries in drag) that suddenly catches Kahn so off-guard you can see the actress blush. After Dame Edna hints of ""her"" own lesbian tendencies, she offers Kahn some phallic-shaped ""pineapple and sausage surprise,"" saying ""you look like a girl who could use something hot inside you.""

By the way, the Richard Dreyfuss episode does NOT have Belushi's ad-libbed finale about Dreyfuss being Jewish.

The camera follows Radner as she charges tourists for a guided tour of her apartment and Murray as he plays minor-league baseball. Morris looks for work as a human lawn jockey, Newman takes a strange vacation to Tahiti and Belushi and Aykroyd perform ""Hey Bartender"" and ""Rubber Biscuit"" as Jake and Elwood Blues at the Universal Amphitheater. Also on the disc: an actual two-minute wardrobe test for Belushi and band director Howard Shore.

'LIMITED EDITION' EXTRAS
Like the initial pressings of the earlier SNL seasons, this Limited Edition third season set comes in a book-style box (dark blue). The inner lid reproduces a hand-painted photo of the cast. Inside sits a black folding slipcase with the seven DVDs. Also in the box are four postcard-sized duo-tone prints. Suitable for framing, they feature photos of the Nerds, Blues Brothers, Gilda, and finally Steve Martin performing ""King Tut.""",1210636800,57,4446,4.888594164456234

3116607,5,B0013LRKQC,"This third season, along with the fourth, represent the height of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players. For the first time, we are introduced to The Blues Brothers, The Festrunk Brothers, Roseanne Roseannadanna, Point Counterpoint, The Olympia Restaurant and many others. Favorites such as the Coneheads and the Samurai return in force as well.

I taped most of this season in its entirety over the years, and am quite familiar with the strength of these episodes. I especially like the Steve Martin/Blues Brothers appearance, as well as the season-ender with Buck Henry/Sun Ra.

I've shared my thoughts on the value of the original SNL before, so instead, I'd like to point out a few highlights to look forward to:

1. Chevy Chase returns for first time hosting duties on 02/18/78. There was quite a bit of backstage animosity/tension towards him, and one particular spat ensued over the Weekend Update anchoring duties. Bill Murray, still the ""new kid,"" was out to hold his ground against Chase, and became defensive of Jane Curtin. Apparently, Belushi - who was the clearest Chase rival - delighted in stirring up the situation to the point that Murray punched Chase right before air time. The fight was broken up, with Murray walking away calling Chase a ""medium talent."" If Chase seems nervous, this was why. Still, Chase does a superb job performing under these circumstances. More trivia: this is the only time Belushi, Aykroyd, Murray and Chase ever share screen time together (for a military-themed skit). Even more trivia: Billy Joel, as Chase tells us, missed his 10th high school reunion to appear.

2. Steve Martin/The Dirt Band (aka Nitty Gritty...) - Martin explains that he went to high school with the Dirt Band members and that they were the most ""talented musicians"" he knew. Martin himself shows off some considerable musical chops (on banjo, natch) when he accompanies the group on an instrumental called ""White Russia."" Randy Newman also addresses the flak he had taken for ""Short People,"" to which he responds with a giant raspberry.

3. While many of us are familiar with the clip of Elvis Costello stopping his song mid-intro to play ""Radio Radio"" instead, some may not know that this show was hosted by an old woman named Miskel Spillman who was the winner of the ""Anyone Can Host"" contest held throughout the first half of the season.

4. Attack of the Atomic Lobsters - the Robert Klein episode has an unusual ""wrap around"" or through-story that ends with everyone in the studio getting killed by giant lobsters. Still strange today, it shows how experimental the show was willing to be. This show also featured the demented brilliance of ""X Police.""

5. The experimentation is also prevalent in the integrity of musical choices, which was always a real treat. Instead of teen pop junk, we may be unexpectedly greeted with a rousing tuba ensemble (yes, that was Gravity, one of the house band member's pet projects), raw country (Willie Nelson), old school R&B (Chi-Lites founder Eugene Record), a personal friend of the cast or guest host (Gary Tigerman), or the guest host themselves (Madeline Kahn, Richard Dreyfuss, Mary Kay Place). Your personal tastes weren't always met, so much as your perspective expanded. The cast were obvious music aficionados themselves, as clearly evidenced by their spirited enthusiasm (Belushi, especially) towards Ray Charles, in a largely music-oriented episode.

6. Curious to see if a little bit cut from syndication will appear here: I remember there being a little tag to the Dreyfuss episode (this resulted from the show being under time). Belushi tells the audience that he loves Dreyfuss despite him being ""a Jew."" Now, Belushi is clearly improvising here and not being antisemitic, but of course this reads much different in our PC-sensitive times. Anyway, I haven't seen that since the original airing.

Many more to note, but I hope that gives you a taste of what's to come!",1209427200,38,3956,4.990895295902883
3116608,5,B0013LRKQC,"SNL episodes are always spotty. That's just the way the show is and always has been. The show is not 100% great and never has been. The Mary Kay Place episode featured in this box ix cited by SNL creator Lorne Michaels himself as the worst episode ever, and has even been kept out of reruns all these years.

If you saw the old SNL shows when they first aired, the nostalgia factor makes it fun to see them again. Especially, many of the music guests.

If you are too young to have seen them when they were new, you probably won't be too impressed now.  Five stars if you were there, two or three stars if you were not there. It's not like seeing M.A.S.H. or All in the Family for the first time.",1207440000,14,696,4.140740740740741

The episode with Steve Martin singing ""King Tut"" may be the single best episode of SNL ever. Leaves even the best SNL casts of the last 15 years in the dust.",1207094400,,262,4.26
3350716,5,B0013LRKQC,"This season still features the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players - John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, Garrett Morris,Jane Curtin and Laraine Newman.  Plus newcomer Bill Murray.

When SNL (at this time it was NBC's Saturday Night Live) first came on it changed the variety format from skits and musical numbers to what is now called sketch comedy with music from popular and upcoming rock groups.  Each episode was ""hosted"" by an actor who was usually promoting their new film.

Each show had an opening skit that end with ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night"", the credits followed, then the guest host would come out do some sort of monologue.  This would fade into either an original SNL cast commercial (remember The Taste Bud's for Budweiser) or a parody of a commercial.  Skit, musical guest, skit, Weekend Update, skit, second musical number, skit and closing.

The show had a number of reoccuring skits, which were rotated to keep them fresh (unlike today when they get an idea they flog it to death!).  The best were Two Wild and Crazy Guys (Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd), the coneheads (Aykroyd, Jane Curtin and Lorraine Newman), Samuari ""Whatever"" (John Belushi), the Killer Bees (cast).

If you have not seen the original episodes uncut then you will understand why this show was so revolutionary.  And remember that at this time people had to stay up to watch the show ""Live"" as most people did not own VCR's in 1977.  So it became a fashionable for groups of young people to have parties and watch the show.

The following are this season's hosts and musical guests:

Steve Martin / Jackson Browne (Running on Empty and The Pretender)

Madeline Kahn / Taj Mahal (Queen Bee) - guest performer Dame Edna Everedge

Hugh Heffner / Libby Titus (Fool That I Am)

Charles Grodin / Paul Simon and The Persuaders (Slip Sliding Away and You're Kind) - Coneheads, Samuai Dry Cleaner, Killer Bees.  Art Garfunkel appears in a skit with Grodin and Simon

Ray Charles and the Raylettes (I Can See Clearly Now, What I'd Say and Hit The Road Jack)- Ray does a parody of Andre Agassi's Cannon commercial.

Buck Henry / Leon Redbone (Champagne Charlie and Please Don't Talk About Me When I Am Gone) - Samurai Psychiatrist

Mary Kay Place / Willie Nelson (Whiskey River, Blue Eye's Crying in the Rain and Something to Brag About) - with appearance by Andy Kaufman

Mrs. Miskel Spillman (Anyone Can Host winner) / Elvis Costello (Watching the Detectives)

Steve Martin / The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (On the Looose with the Blues) & Randy Newman (Short People and Rider on the Rain) - Two Wild and Crazy Guys, Coneheads

Robert Klien / Bonnie Raitt (Runaway and Give It All Up or Let Me Go) - Lobsters Attack the Show

Chevy Chase / Billy Joel (Only the Good Die Young and Just the Way You Are) - Chevy as Ford

O.J. Simpson / Ashford and Simpson (So, So Satisfied and Don't Cost You Nothing) - Samurai Night Fever, Hertz

Art Garfunkel (All I Know, Scarsburough Fair and Crying in My Sleep)/ Stephen Bishop (On & On)

Jill Claburgh / Eddie Money (Two Tickets to Paradise and Baby Hold On) - Coneheads

Christopher Lee / Meatloaf (All Rewed Up & No Place to Go and Two Out of Three Ain't Bad) - appearance by Richard Belzer

But the classic skits (like Steve Martin's ""King Tut"") are still a riot.  All in all we laughed out loud at some of this and ended up fast forwarding on other parts.

Perceived Running Time: 40 minutes (depending on the episode)

Replay-ability: high
Estimated Durability: 4 generations+
Audience: Wide. Fifth grade and up (some mildly dirty jokes).

Why:
This is one of the best and most entertaining time-windows into the late 70's you'll ever find. It features some of the funniest, most talented performers, at their height, hungry, raw and energetic. This is about the time when they'd polished off the rougher edges, but before the show became tiresome formulaic. Watching each episode in it's entirety is important as each one had an overall rhythm and flow like a good music album or symphony. My 6th grader has found a cornucopia of inspiration from this trove of forgotten excellence in performance and modern vaudeville. I predict that the material herein will remain fresh and highly entertaining long-after my generation is dead and gone. The Charles Grodin episode alone was hysterical from beginning to end, in a weirdly post-modern way. My son's watched that single week several times over.

Without the commercials, the episodes fly by. They can also be enjoyed in chapters if you need a some quick entertainment.

This is also a great time capsule of Americana, reflecting the mind and matters of the late 70's. If you want to get a cultural feel for that time, or share it with someone else, this is better than any history book. While it does mock timely events and make timely references, it does not rely on them to the point of alienating subsequent generations; about as much as classic Loony Tunes or Monty Python.

In addition to the comedy, it also features some very candid performances by famous musicians, also in their early prime.

Why not:
The jokes do get a little dirty here and there; it is a late-night product of the swinger culture of NYC. It would be considered racy even by today's broadcast standards. It periodically makes references to people and events that are long-forgotten, even by those of us who were active in those days. The most intolerant youth might call it dated, and the pacing is of course slower than modern comedy. The skits that do rely too heavily on the forgotten are easily skipped.

Further, the quality is not strictly consistent. Some ""weeks"" are funnier/better than others. Some skits soar while some bomb. But even the weakest weeks are quite entertaining. But this is the result of it's organic nature. As it grew in consistency in the 80's, it lost genius.

Kudos:
Raw, hungry, fresh, energetic talent.

Demerits:
Occasional out-dated references.
A blu-ray edition would be appreciated with more special features, bookmarks and the ability to play only the musical segments.

Notes:
You might be given to buy one of the ""Best Of"" volumes, but you'd be cheating yourself. Again, each week had a flow. At the risk of comparing SNL with immortal classics, it would be like attending a Best Of Shakespeare. It would be like only watching the highlights of a sporting event. Too much of the overall experience is lost. Several youth I know never ""got"" the classic SNL until they sat down and watched complete episodes.

Verdict: Don't bore younger people with your old-people stories of how great the 70's used to be. Show them some of this and then just answer their questions.",1367712000,4,3345,4.934163701067615

3351097,5,B0013LRKQC,"SNL was a very different show in its first five years from the show it would become. It did not pander to popular or dumbed-down tastes, nor was it an excuse for a modestly talented performer to plug their latest star vehicle. The show's third season displayed multiple talents reaching their peak, and the remarkable emergence of Bill Murray as a major comic actor. The musical guests are a truly colorful lot, rather than the flavor-of-the-week acts that are booked today. Most of all, this was the final year that the writing was shaped by the brilliant Michael O'Donoghue and his hilariously dark perspective. The Robert Klein episode concludes with Mr. Mike's elaborate spoof of D-grade monster movies, ""Attack of the Atomic Lobsters,"" which manages to send up Roger Corman, Orson Welles's ""War of the Worlds,"" and the radio broadcast of the Hindenburg disaster, all at the same time. You'll never see anything as wild or risky as this on network TV again. This was also the year of the episode that many on the show considered their best ever, the April 1978 show hosted by Steve Martin. SNL defined comedy for at least a generation.

The one with Christopher Lee and guest Meat Loaf is one where I actually learned the whole show by heart, as I taped it (audio cassette) the night of March 25, 1978.  Remember when Lee plays Mr. Death and apologizes to Lorraine for Tippy?  How 'bout when Bill Murray does the Oscar predictions (they'll give it to Richard Burton to make up for losing Liz Taylor).  Then there's the Elvis Costello  one on Dec. 17, '77, where he stops the song ""Less than Zero"" and plays ""Radio Radio"" instead.
  Jill Clayburgh hosts one, Steve Martin, the Blues Brothers perform, and you know the rest.  How could the show have risen to such a high standard here, and how did the show with the same name fall to such a low level after the original cast left?

3351102,5,B0013LRKQC,"Many reviewers say these early Saturday Night Live seasons are products of their times, that they aren't nearly as funny today as we all thought they were back then. To that I say dude, what have you been smokin'? Yes, I was one of those who watched these shows in college, usually at a party where everyone was, shall we say, already in a purple haze. But thinking that's what made these shows great is simply revisionist history.

Sure there are some dated cultural jokes, a few lame musical guests and an occasional skit that falls flat. However, each episode is still, for the most part, solidly entertaining. As I sat down with these discs today partaking of nothing stronger than a few Diet Cokes, what I noticed is just how watchable these shows still are. Even when not at their best, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin and the others each did at least interesting work, and always in their own personal style. What resulted was a true comedy variety show, a witty take on middlebrow culture that though edgy at times, rarely takes a cheap shot or wallows in the gutter.

Originally 90 minutes long with commercial breaks, each commercial-free episode here runs between 66 and 68 minutes.

This third season may be the best in Saturday Night's history. Most every show includes at least one of SNL's most famous recurring skits as well as some hilarious forgotten moments. For example, the first show includes Lorne Michaels upping his offer to the Beatles from $3,000 to $3,200 and a commercial parody for the Kromega III, ""a watch so complex it takes two people to make it work."" The second episode tosses in an ad for Swill (""the water that's dredged from Lake Erie""), a great skit with Gilda and host Madeline Kahn as two drunken single girls who discuss everything from dates who endlessly drone on about ""The Patty Duke Show"" to how to lie on a bed ""so the fat on your thighs isn't spread out,"" and an ad-libbed chat between Kahn and Dame Edna (English comedian Barry Humphries in drag) that suddenly catches Kahn so off-guard you can see the actress blush. After Dame Edna hints of ""her"" own lesbian tendencies, she offers Kahn some phallic-shaped ""pineapple and sausage surprise,"" saying ""you look like a girl who could use something hot inside you.""

By the way, the Richard Dreyfuss episode does NOT have Belushi's ad-libbed finale about Dreyfuss being Jewish.

The camera follows Radner as she charges tourists for a guided tour of her apartment and Murray as he plays minor-league baseball. Morris looks for work as a human lawn jockey, Newman takes a strange vacation to Tahiti and Belushi and Aykroyd perform ""Hey Bartender"" and ""Rubber Biscuit"" as Jake and Elwood Blues at the Universal Amphitheater. Also on the disc: an actual two-minute wardrobe test for Belushi and band director Howard Shore.

'LIMITED EDITION' EXTRAS
Like the initial pressings of the earlier SNL seasons, this Limited Edition third season set comes in a book-style box (dark blue). The inner lid reproduces a hand-painted photo of the cast. Inside sits a black folding slipcase with the seven DVDs. Also in the box are four postcard-sized duo-tone prints. Suitable for framing, they feature photos of the Nerds, Blues Brothers, Gilda, and finally Steve Martin performing ""King Tut.""",1210636800,57,4446,4.888594164456234

3351104,5,B0013LRKQC,"This third season, along with the fourth, represent the height of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players. For the first time, we are introduced to The Blues Brothers, The Festrunk Brothers, Roseanne Roseannadanna, Point Counterpoint, The Olympia Restaurant and many others. Favorites such as the Coneheads and the Samurai return in force as well.

I taped most of this season in its entirety over the years, and am quite familiar with the strength of these episodes. I especially like the Steve Martin/Blues Brothers appearance, as well as the season-ender with Buck Henry/Sun Ra.

I've shared my thoughts on the value of the original SNL before, so instead, I'd like to point out a few highlights to look forward to:

1. Chevy Chase returns for first time hosting duties on 02/18/78. There was quite a bit of backstage animosity/tension towards him, and one particular spat ensued over the Weekend Update anchoring duties. Bill Murray, still the ""new kid,"" was out to hold his ground against Chase, and became defensive of Jane Curtin. Apparently, Belushi - who was the clearest Chase rival - delighted in stirring up the situation to the point that Murray punched Chase right before air time. The fight was broken up, with Murray walking away calling Chase a ""medium talent."" If Chase seems nervous, this was why. Still, Chase does a superb job performing under these circumstances. More trivia: this is the only time Belushi, Aykroyd, Murray and Chase ever share screen time together (for a military-themed skit). Even more trivia: Billy Joel, as Chase tells us, missed his 10th high school reunion to appear.

2. Steve Martin/The Dirt Band (aka Nitty Gritty...) - Martin explains that he went to high school with the Dirt Band members and that they were the most ""talented musicians"" he knew. Martin himself shows off some considerable musical chops (on banjo, natch) when he accompanies the group on an instrumental called ""White Russia."" Randy Newman also addresses the flak he had taken for ""Short People,"" to which he responds with a giant raspberry.

3. While many of us are familiar with the clip of Elvis Costello stopping his song mid-intro to play ""Radio Radio"" instead, some may not know that this show was hosted by an old woman named Miskel Spillman who was the winner of the ""Anyone Can Host"" contest held throughout the first half of the season.

4. Attack of the Atomic Lobsters - the Robert Klein episode has an unusual ""wrap around"" or through-story that ends with everyone in the studio getting killed by giant lobsters. Still strange today, it shows how experimental the show was willing to be. This show also featured the demented brilliance of ""X Police.""

5. The experimentation is also prevalent in the integrity of musical choices, which was always a real treat. Instead of teen pop junk, we may be unexpectedly greeted with a rousing tuba ensemble (yes, that was Gravity, one of the house band member's pet projects), raw country (Willie Nelson), old school R&B (Chi-Lites founder Eugene Record), a personal friend of the cast or guest host (Gary Tigerman), or the guest host themselves (Madeline Kahn, Richard Dreyfuss, Mary Kay Place). Your personal tastes weren't always met, so much as your perspective expanded. The cast were obvious music aficionados themselves, as clearly evidenced by their spirited enthusiasm (Belushi, especially) towards Ray Charles, in a largely music-oriented episode.

6. Curious to see if a little bit cut from syndication will appear here: I remember there being a little tag to the Dreyfuss episode (this resulted from the show being under time). Belushi tells the audience that he loves Dreyfuss despite him being ""a Jew."" Now, Belushi is clearly improvising here and not being antisemitic, but of course this reads much different in our PC-sensitive times. Anyway, I haven't seen that since the original airing.

Many more to note, but I hope that gives you a taste of what's to come!",1209427200,38,3956,4.990895295902883
3351105,5,B0013LRKQC,"SNL episodes are always spotty. That's just the way the show is and always has been. The show is not 100% great and never has been. The Mary Kay Place episode featured in this box ix cited by SNL creator Lorne Michaels himself as the worst episode ever, and has even been kept out of reruns all these years.

If you saw the old SNL shows when they first aired, the nostalgia factor makes it fun to see them again. Especially, many of the music guests.

If you are too young to have seen them when they were new, you probably won't be too impressed now.  Five stars if you were there, two or three stars if you were not there. It's not like seeing M.A.S.H. or All in the Family for the first time.",1207440000,14,696,4.140740740740741

If you grew up with it, welcome the memories. If you look at the current SNL and wonder what the fuss is about - track this set down.",1522800000,2,280,3.9298245614035086

Why bother to sell it to someone with a missing disk when someone is expecting to get all of them?
I had to reorder this from someone else & it's new so it shouldn't have any missing disks.
If I had known disk 5 was missing I would never have ordered it.",1488585600,,348,4.057971014492754
