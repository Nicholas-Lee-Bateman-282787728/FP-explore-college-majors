7364257,3,B013FO6OXE,"Based on a novel by Ursula K/ La Guin, this is one of those fantasy stories with wizards, High Priestess', evil doers and magic. A young up-and-coming wizard, Ged (Shawn Ashmore) and an occasional buddy is tasked with saving their world ""Earthsea"" from recent bad buys and old evil ones. Meanwhile back at the temple a sister Kossil (Jennifer Calvert) with a nasty attitude and a vile of poison is trying to usurp the High priestess position from Thar (Isabella Rossellini). Will the wizard succeed in his mission? Will the slinky sister fulfill her mission?

Well costumed, fair graphics, contemporary dialog.

Before watching this story you may want to read some of Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces""

And if you are a fan of Isabella Rossellini, she has a great series of shorts called ""Green Porn"" It's all about bugs, fish, and other such creatures.",1496188800,,870,4.864864864864865

7364261,1,B013FO6OXE,"Le Guin (author of the original books) hated it so much that she never gave anyone else the rights to any of her stories after this.  This is a travesty that disgraces the original so much its hard to stomach.
The plot is completely changed and dumbed down to a cookie cutter fantasy story, they white washed all the characters (yeah they were all black or native american) for no good reason and its just all around crap.  Don't support this kind of cash grab, just don't do it.",1530748800,2,479,4.370786516853933
7364262,1,B013FO6OXE,"Not sure, but maybe the second worst thing I've ever watched. Lemme think, ....Yep second behind Mozart in the Jungle as far as bad, really bad acting. Come'on  Danny, you know you can get better roles than this dribble. As an carpenter even i could get you better directors/screen plays than this. Yeesh.",1530057600,,305,4.754716981132075
7364263,5,B013FO6OXE,Awesome series!  A tale of magic and faith - and how they both dwell within us.  I wish I had discovered this series sooner!,1529971200,,124,4.125
7364264,1,B013FO6OXE,"While many seem to enjoy this series on its own merits, fans of the original books will be horrified with the large number of liberties take with the source material which include 1) colorblind casting for a work that is very important in that the ""civilized"" peoples are nonwhite and the barbarian's are the white guys 2) weird, pointless switching the the main character's true name and use name (Ged vs Sparrowhawk) 3) Ogion the silent who really, really likes to talk.

That was as far as I could get really. Many people like it cause it's about ""defeating the darkness"" which is a far departure from the Taoist themed source material which is more about the balance of light and dark and how both are important.",1529884800,5,716,4.637795275590551
7364265,3,B013FO6OXE,"This is one of those fantasy mini-series (two episodes on Amazon Video) where reading the books is probably the better idea. Nevertheless, as a standalone movie, it was okay. Earthsea the movie seemed like an abridged mixture of some nuanced unique-like subplots with some derivative storytelling arcs and main plot lines as crafted for the movie format. The wizard's school reminded me a lot of another major series; not a bad thing, but derivative. Earthsea was in no way based on the other series I'm thinking of; I'm just saying that Earthsea as presented in this movie form reminded occasionally pressed the derivative button, so to speak.

The relationship--though it's a stretch to really call it that--between Ged (played by Ashmore) and Tenar (played by Kreuk) was just enough of a unique tilt in this series for me to recommend it. For example, I did like how Ged and Tenar ultimately came together to defeat the Unnamed Ones and restore balance. Their relationship would be rated PG.

The acting was inconsistent, but not bad. I say inconsistent, because the king character, Tygath (played by Roche) was too campy--not sure if it was overacting, bad directing/script, or bad acting, but whatever it was, it was distracting and detracted from the other actors, in my opinion.

Overall, Earthsea--the movie--just felt very rushed and overly abridged. There were plot holes, like how did Ged initially prevent himself from being possessed in the fjord search scene when he went looking for the Gebbeth to basically tell it it had no power over him? There were a couple other plot holes, too, but I am giving the mini-series the benefit of the doubt. And that is the thing, I had to give the benefit of the doubt too many times. It was still entertaining with a couple of interesting subplots here and there, but it was overall just okay. I do recommend it to serious readers/viewers of the fantasy genre, but there are better series to start with.",1529712000,3,1955,4.864864864864865
7364266,3,B013FO6OXE,"I watched this years ago, and I'm going to re-watch the thing. In the interim, I am obliged to note that Ursula K. Le Guin (see wikipedia or her website) did not like this ""version"" of her books. She wasn't really consulted and objected to a producer saying that she was. She had sold the rights and really had no participation in the tv series.
Still, it may sail, as is.
Personally, I found it hard to recognize the books from watching this.",1528934400,,443,4.349397590361446

8727557,4,B013FO6OXE,"Although there have been many people complaining that it is not much like the book, I believe this movie to have done a very good job with what it presented the viewers. The story was coherent. The characters were well-developed. The plot made sense. Judging it with no reference to the book, and looking at it as two TV movies, it was well done. It certainly was better than the Studio Ghibli one, which made no sense whatsoever as it just threw viewers in the middle of a convoluted plot and expected them to understand the mind of the director. It wasn't a perfect epic like Lord of the Rings, but hey, this was basically a miniseries for a channel that is not known for quality.",1535241600,,682,4.420634920634921
8727558,1,B013FO6OXE,"This series is Earthsea in name only. Almost nothing about this adaptation is true to the books, which is a shame, because they did not improve upon the books at all. Bad acting, terrible FX, in general, a terrible experience.",1534982400,,226,4.675

8727562,3,B013FO6OXE,"The book was excellent and had the kind of depth this lacks.  I understand when dealing with a fantasy that producers see the budget as being well spent on props and FX, but in truth the story would be better served by understanding that when we read the books, our minds fill in all that is visually missing if we care enough to do so.
As it stands it is a fun enough time and there are a few some solid performances even if the filmmakers tried to copy Harry Potter amongst other fantasy themes.",1532131200,,497,4.231578947368421
8727563,4,B013FO6OXE,"peace between humans and dragons? more like defeating the evil forces and human minions, and keeping the whatever they were, stuffed in a magical closet so it can't hurt people.
The part that i really liked- when the guy and girl who belong together, lock that amulet thingy as one, and their combined gifts are super powered- as ordained no doubt by the Creator ( i am very sure that's how it would be determined, with real humans anyway). YES!
Didn't think that GED ( is that a high school dropout ?) was well cast, most everyone else was.",1531180800,,541,4.474747474747475
8727564,2,B013FO6OXE,"I didn't like it because the acting was flat and missed the normal interaction of conversation. A poor attempt to sound like old English mixed with modern English. My stomach was turning and I really wanted to turn it off, it was so bad, but like a train wreck I had to keep watching. The only redeeming quality was the occasional magic and supernatural parts but even some of them were poor. All in all, if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have watched it.",1530835200,,463,4.2727272727272725
