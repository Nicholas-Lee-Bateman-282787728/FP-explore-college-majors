8405166,2,B003TKS7EY,"Very cute stories. some of the DVDs contain cartoons and songs from the 60's. Though I didn't mind, it seems they add one popular cartoon to each DVD and fill it up with extra, old, cartoons. My son liked them, but  think it wasn't worth the money.",1417824000,,248,4.276595744680851
8405167,5,B003TKS7EY,"When I saw this video, the price has dropped to $2.99 for all three DVDs! I could barely believe it! i have a lot of Scholastic DVDs for my classroom use and this was a great addition. I already had one of the DVDs included (there is Where the Wild Things Are + other stories, The Black Lagoon and other stories and then the Halloween Collection with the Very Brave Witch. I just have the Where the Wild Things Are DVD to another kindergarten teacher at my school.",1398470400,,464,4.284090909090909
8405168,5,B003TKS7EY,"This set is a great value for the price, and my daughter really enjoys watching it. Although it's marketed as a Halloween collection, the ""Where the Wild Things Are"" disc doesn't really fit the theme, nor does ""Shrinking Violet"" on the ""Teacher From the Black Lagoon"" disc. ""Shrinking Violet"" also appears on a different Scholastic collection we own.

I can't complain, though, because my daughter is happy. :) I plan on ordering more Scholastic dvds in the future, and highly recommend them.",1383696000,,492,5.0
8405169,4,B003TKS7EY,"The Halloween Stories Collection
18 Stories on 3 DVDs, being released October 26, 2010

Scholastic Storybook Treasures is releasing 18 of their kid-friendly Halloween stories bringing books to life in a way that will get the children excited for the holiday without freaking them out. Scholastic claims this set encourages cooperation, early reading skills, and problem solving. It includes some narration from Elle Fanning and Calista Flockhart among other celebrities but the focus here is on the classic stories. The first DVD includes ""A Very Brave Witch"", ""By the Light of the Halloween Moon"", ""A Dark, Dark Tale"", ""Georgie"", ""The Witch in the Cherry Tree"", ""The Three-legged Cat"", ""The Three Robbers"", and ""Little Tim and the Brave Sea Captain."" The second DVD is a collection of stories by Maurice Sendak. It includes ""Where the Wild Things Are"", ""In the Night Kitchen"", ""Alligators All Around"", ""One was Johnny"", ""Chicken Soup with Rice"" (mmmm), and ""Pierre."" The last DVD includes the slightly scary (but not really) stories of ""The Teacher from the Black Lagoon"", ""The Librarian from the Black Lagoon"", ""The Gym Teacher from the Black Lagoon"" (Clearly, this is a location of prime real estate.), and ""Shrinking Violet.""

Bonus Features:

There are Spanish and French versions of ""Where the Wild Things Are"", a featurette on author Maurice Sendak, interviews with author Mike Thaler and illustrator Jared Lee, read-alongs, and discussion questions for comprehension.",1288483200,10,1475,5.349137931034483
