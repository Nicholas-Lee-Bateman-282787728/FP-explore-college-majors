8545600,5,B009Z4AB8I,"Berlin Tunnel 21:  First rate combination of Hollywood and real world events. Filmed entirely on location in West Berlin. German actors speaking English give it an authentic ""sound"" but it is easy to follow due it being in English. Came out in 1981 (I was in Korea) but I never heard of it until 2017. Wow! Great movie, nail biter much of the time, intrigue, impossible odds, powerful ending. Richard Thomas and fellow cast do a great job at acting like real persons ....""Sandy"" being highly motivated but somewhat naive, other characters afraid to leave the known East for the unknown West, the impact of divided families, etc. (the wall was new when the movie was based).",1494892800,,673,4.752136752136752

8545602,5,B009Z4AB8I,The stars are for Berlin  Tunnel 21. I am not a Thomas fan but found the movie very involving and ncely paced. Surprised at how nice the picture and sound are considering it is Issued by a cheapo dvd company.,1435708800,,208,4.2
8545603,4,B009Z4AB8I,Both were entertaining and well done. Berlin Tunnel 21 was of particular interest because I was stationed in West Berlin during the late 70's. The East German police and their Soviet puppet masters were portrayed well.,1421020800,2,218,5.083333333333333
8545604,5,B009Z4AB8I,I watched this movie about the Berlin Wall coming down and the necessary requirement of families re-uniting by creating a tunnel and I really enjoyed it. I strongly recommend it because I showed it for my World History class and the students really enjoyed it. We also did several Common Core Standard assignments using the plot! Great film!,1403568000,,341,4.896551724137931

8545606,3,B009Z4AB8I,"Good film, Another film made for TV(but NOT on DVD yet in the USA! the Tony Danza movie f: Freedom Fighter made in the 80's  was  just as good if not better.",1358899200,,157,3.875
