I'm sorry it doesn't seem to be in production any longer, because it is one of the most fun videos I have ever done.  I didn't understand a lot of what was being said, because it's in Spanish, and some of the moves are tricky to get at first, but that's ok.  If I could do it all the first time, it wouldn't be challenging.  The music is great, and the moves are fun.  The time just flew by!",1028764800,,493,3.919191919191919
