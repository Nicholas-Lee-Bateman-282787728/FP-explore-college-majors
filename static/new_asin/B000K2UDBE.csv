8153984,1,B000K2UDBE,"East Coast Swing Volume Three
One of the weakest of the Grant Austin series of lessons. The DVD is only 59 minutes long; most of his other DVD'S are 90 minutes. The focus is very soft, with looks like a transfer from an old VHS tape. I have had four years of dance instruction, and I did not learn much from this ""advanced"" East Coast.
There is too much emphasis on syncopated footwork and syncopated tucks. What I did learn was the right side slotted tunnel, the ""around the world"" (tuck and roll), and other tunnel moves and tips. Other than the tunnels, I cannot recommend this DVD.
