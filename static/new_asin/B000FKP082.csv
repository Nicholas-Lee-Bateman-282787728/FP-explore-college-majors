8124280,5,B000FKP082,"Loved this DVD.  Railroads are the backbone of the USA infrastructure. This DVD showed how important safety is in the railroad industry, and how it took a long time for railroads to see that, via thier own history.",1374105600,,214,4.631578947368421
8124281,3,B000FKP082,Not sure what I was expecting but I found this interesting but of limited watchability if that is a word.  I prefer working steam trains and much of this is historical picture of wrecks or drawings of same.  It would make a better book than a video.  In videos you want to see movement.  This is like seeing a video of the Mona Lisa.  It just sits there.,1358035200,2,354,4.147058823529412
8124282,5,B000FKP082,"I have researched the Dutchman's Curve train wreck for almost a year
and this is the only DVD on railroad history I viewed that includes
the Nashville rail disaster of 1918. However,I do wish the film maker had explored
the disputed death toll, (witnesses and survivors believed there were
far more fatalities than the ICC reported.) The photos by NC&StL photographer Henry Hill Sr. are very clear and the reenactment is very well done . Little is known about the head on collision that occured near Nashville on July 9th
1918 so I was happy to discover this DVD.

Also lots of information on the causes of rail accidents in the early
years of rail history.",1195171200,,657,4.663793103448276
8124283,2,B000FKP082,"I thought Great Train Disasters but it wasn't, what a disappointment. A re-hash of train history in 50 mins with not a single modern disaster in sight. Barely made it into the 1900's. Why pay the price when you get whole box sets for a little more? Not good value for the dollar.",1171065600,,279,4.283018867924528
