8288238,5,B001CMZCK8,"This is an extremely helpful documentary. ""Sacred Buffalo People"" greatly assists the non-Native-American
with understanding the spiritual nature of the bison, the buffalo -- the animal's true power -- for Indians (and members of the
Sioux nation in particular). It also targets the nuanced reality of the human-wild animal relationship (compare it, for example, to Herzog's
touching & disturbing ""Grizzly"" documentary).
""Sacred Buffalo People"" is very unpretentious, clear, direct, authentic.
And, to tell you the truth,
it's been such a success in my own attempte to instruct this subject that the DVD was stolen! The students
loved the film;  yet soon discovered that only a few minutes of it was available online. Thus they could not stream it, download it, for free.
So this wonderful film disappeared from our ""for reference only"" section.
Oddly enough, I think this was a good sign, in a way. For when things get lifted a lot,
it certainly shows how popular they are.
Not to worry -- I'm back again buying yet another copy. It's worth it.
For what the shark has been for the Polynesians, the reindeer for the Laps, the buffalo has been for many Indians past & present.

It's a life-sustaining relation, well worth trying to understand.
Thank you.
