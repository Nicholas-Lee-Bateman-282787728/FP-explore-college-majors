4107817,4,B003C9VFDW,"As others have mentioned, the content of this video is amazing! You will not be disappointed by the amount of detail this documentary has in it. However, the supposed ""HD"" quality of the video is terrible. Bright lights and fast movements cause lines and blocks to appear on the screen. At first, I thought it was my TV, but after reading other reviews, it's definitely the way they made the DVDs. It's still watchable, but it can get annoying, especially during the Lighting section. It's still worth buying just for the content.",1262563200,5,530,4.771739130434782
4107818,4,B003C9VFDW,I echo the thoughts of many of the reviews on here. Very intense behind the scenes look at everything that helps to create a Rush gig. At 250 minutes long you get great value for money. On the minus side the quality of picture isn't great and the biggest bug bear for me is the dreadful repetative heavy background music (not Rush unfortunately) which tends to drown out a lot of the speech. There is no need for it.,1261958400,3,416,4.2784810126582276
4107819,4,B003C9VFDW,"I am a huge Rush fan, and I also do production work, so I was really excited to get this.

On the upside the content of this show is fantastic.  They do an excellent job of taking you through the day of a touring rock show.  Plenty of basic information for those who don't work in the industry laid out in layman's terms, and there is some great content for seasoned professionals.  This is great for any Rush fan, and for those looking to go into production as a profession.

On the downside the actual production of this DVD set blows.  The DVD rolls through episodes without stopping, as if it were on a default ""Play All"".  Not only that, but the 3rd part is actually split between the two discs so you get an insert second disc message.  Also, for a production company called High Fidelity HDTV the video quality is lacking.  Any time there is a quick camera move or the concert lighting gets intense the image gets blocky and seems to have trouble keeping up.  If this documentary was actually shot in HD then the company really dropped the ball here.  It's as if they just dumped it onto DVD with out really thinking about the quality or usability of it.

The pros far outweigh the cons here though.  For the veteran rush fans the brief interviews and glimpses of the band backstage offer a nice little peak into their world. I would also reccommend this to any high school drama or theatre teacher looking to nurture their tech crew and show them they can get into the business.",1261872000,3,1486,4.419117647058823
4107820,5,B003C9VFDW,"Great insight into pre & post gig preparations and the amount of hard graft involved to put on a show but there isn't much in the way of concert footage if that's what you're expecting.
For die hard fans really",1261785600,,210,4.275
4107821,4,B003C9VFDW,"This is a very in depth look at what it takes to be on the road. Just so happens to be about my favorite touring band, Rush. The access is amazing adn fans get to see all of the behind the scenes goings on of a major rock show.

The only caveat is the video isn't always great. During certain stage effects and lighting shots the video will become very blocky and pixelated. This occurs at least once per episode and is annoying, but the content more than makes up for that.",1260835200,3,474,4.1521739130434785
4107822,5,B003C9VFDW,"If you like rock concerts - you will like this video

If your a Rush fan - you will love this video.

I found it fascinating and well worth watching.",1260835200,2,149,3.933333333333333
4107833,5,B003C9VFDW,A great way to understand what it takes Rush (or any other large band) to put a show together.  It's amazing how it all comes together in such a short time and then off to the next show.,1334275200,2,186,3.8947368421052633
4107834,5,B003C9VFDW,"IF you are a Rush fan, you MUST get this DVD.  Very interesting about how the stage is setup, lighting, sound, etc. VERY good video!",1331510400,2,132,4.28
4107835,5,B003C9VFDW,"This was a wonderful, very very detailed look into the making of putting on a show from the perspective of the road crew directors while Rush had toured during the Snakes and Arrow's period.

The Chapters are broken down into Sound, Lights, Instrument, and overall management of directing the show from load off point.
I was really impressed with the care and motivation these individuals put into their jobs.  It is common for them to work 16 hour long days to get a show into gear.

Some of my favorite areas were Lighting.  ( Nothing can be put onto the stage until the rigging of sound and lights can be put into place).

Too much to share here, but I intend to watch this over again.",1325376000,2,688,4.428571428571429
4107836,5,B003C9VFDW,"A REAL rock band, with the BIGGEST production in rock. Rush's stagehands lead you backstage. You don't get the posh and glitzy, ""star"" treatment---you see the HARD, and dangerous work these guys (and gals) do EVERY day, and the time constraints they're under. It's become so taken for granted that you go to a concert, and you expect good sound, good lights, and a glitch free show. There's no band like Rush live, and that is as much due to their FANTASTIC (best in the biz, most likely) road crew.

If you love rock and roll, whether you care about Rush or not---get this. It is CHOCK full of GREAT behind the scenes stuff that I've really never seen on a DVD before.

I think this is a very important work. I cannot tell you how impressed I was by the quantity and the quality. You get TWO great DVD's and there's NO filler. You'll be on the edge of your seat and TIRED by the end. Watching these folks, and biting your nails night after night might just do you in, lol.

Enjoy this. It's better than you might think, and there's NOTHING else like it!",1324339200,3,1054,4.340101522842639
4107837,5,B003C9VFDW,This is an outstanding video for anyone who has ever wondered what it's like to work as a roadie. It has a lot of detail and information about what goes into setting up for one of the greatest bands of our time.,1322092800,,211,4.0476190476190474
4107838,4,B003C9VFDW,"If this didn't feature RUSH, I wouldn't have bought it.  I expected it to be more like ""Behind The Lighted Stage"" but I was wrong.  Not the best documentary, very slow at times and not as informative as it could have been.  But it's RUSH, so I had to have it.",1320019200,,259,4.03921568627451
4107839,5,B003C9VFDW,This is a well made and comprehensive behind the scenes look at how a concert tour is put together.  There's a lot of info here that is not common knowledge.,1305417600,2,157,4.233333333333333
4107840,4,B003C9VFDW,"The Backstage Secrets is very similar in structure to a little known, but fascinating documentary done by NFL films of the Journey Frontiers tour many years ago. This video has a great structure in that the individual components of the total production are broken out into chapters, each approx. 1 hour long and covering specific aspects of the concert production. If you are a Rush fan, the bands appearance and on stage performances are very minimum, but very candid and interesting. If you are a musician, and have been on the road, or a roadie, this is a must watch and very, very interesting. I am an automation engineer and an ex-professional musician many years ago. I found this video, which appears to be a multi-episodic documentary, probably produced for Canadian Public TV, interesting from the technical side to the extreme. The explanations of the setup, the magic of the rigging, the incredible talent and creativity of the road crew, and the relationship of men who must work together for months in demanding conditions are all presented with a great sense of light comedy. The cast of odd characters is entertaining, and the devotion to their work at the cost of their personal situations is sobering. This video isn't for everyone, but if you are a rigger, electrician, pipefitter, mechanic, roadie, basement musician, or aspiring band manager, get it and you will enjoy it immensely. And for you Rush fans, you can even figure what the dinosaurs and Barbie dolls are all about!",1299196800,15,1496,4.91699604743083
4107841,5,B003C9VFDW,"I wasn't expecting much, but this DVD set blew me away. Everything you ever wanted to know (and more) about what's entailed in putting together a major show. Sound, lighting, instrument techs, video, tour buses,... how they do it all day in and day out is simply amazing. I'm a Rush fan, but you don't need to be to enjoy this 4+ hour gem.",1296345600,14,339,4.3125
4107842,5,B003C9VFDW,"This is the best behind the scenes with RUSH. Shows and explains everything there is to know about setting up the stage, rigging lights, sound checks, etc etc etc. Each chapter on the dvd is a solid hour long! Will take a while to watch all of it, so this is by far more than worth it for RUSH fans world-wide. Makes you not only appreciate the band more but the crew that sets the show every night. Its truely amazing to watch. This is a MUST for any RUSH fan!!!!",1293408000,3,464,4.1098901098901095

fully entertained.....",1282694400,16,209,3.75
4107847,2,B003C9VFDW,"The band ought to sue the makers of this video for what a crappy job they did on it. And to think that RUSH allowed them to use their band name on the front cover. I have never seen video production this bad. These guys need to go back to school and re-take ""DVD 101"" all over again. It's simply disgraceful. Then, they use stock music (monotonous, bad stock music) throughout all five hours. Uggh! No Rush music. It's cool if you want to see what it takes to get a rock show up and running (although this documentary could have been about ANY band), but that's about it. I wanted desperately to give this only one star, but gave it two only because it has something to do with RUSH! Do yourself a favor: DON'T waste your money on this horribly produced monstrosity. Save the cash and go see RUSH this summer!",1272240000,2,809,4.294117647058823
4107848,2,B003C9VFDW,"This is a behind the scenes look at setting up for Rush concerts. I had done this kind of work for one summer, so i knew a lot about what they were talking about. I am a huge Rush fan, but this is one item that I could do without. Seeing there stage set-up is not as cool as seeing them perform on stage. Love Rush, and I know that the crew works hard for the shows, but I do not need a chronicle of their work. I say pass on this DVD.",1268697600,3,435,3.6881720430107525
4107849,3,B003C9VFDW,In a nutshell I agree with all the above reviews but the thing I hated the MOST was the annoying background music. Was too loud at most times and was the same stuff over and over. Otherwise a good technical view of backstage and all the roadies were colorful.,1266710400,2,259,4.3061224489795915
4107850,3,B003C9VFDW,"As a big Rush fan it is amazing to see what goes on behind the band, and the team work that puts together a great show. I only gave a 3 star rate because the dvd quality was not great.(Been spoilt with blu-ray)
all together worth having. A must for any Rush fan.  :-)",1264809600,2,267,3.9444444444444446
4107851,3,B003C9VFDW,"Having watched the first two episodes, it is clear that the concept this video is trying to show has a lot of merit.  Showing some of what goes on behind the scenes setting up for shows in several arenas, and brief bits of the actual performance during the shows.

What is also clear is that this is a very cheaply made video.  It's potentially better than home video quality, but in many places it's really hard to even give it that level of quality.  There are considerable compression artifacts in the video, to the point of distraction.  This becomes very obvious in the lighting episode, but others have similar problems.  If you're thinking ""How it's made"" or similar History Channel or Science Channel serial documentary, it's nowhere close quality wise.

The videos are also a bit of a tease.  They start going into detail on one of the roles, then jump back to high level fluff like ""waiting for points"".  If you're interested in what they're actually using to produce the show, you'll be disappointed, very little of that information made it into the final video.  If you know what various bits which could be in the rig look like already, the video gets you close enough to pick out what the various items actually are, but again you have to know what you are looking at first.

The idea, done right would be great, but as is, this video is often painful to watch.",1264636800,11,1375,4.571428571428571
4107852,3,B003C9VFDW,the content of the dvd is fabulous.its the quality of the data and the manufacturing/ burning of the disc that leaves alot to be desired. thru-out the entire 2 disc set the bottom portion of the television screen appears blurry and wavey. granted i don't have the highest tier equipment but none of my other rush disc's does this--in fact none of my other stuff does it all.,1263081600,,374,4.514705882352941

8394168,1,B003C9VFDW,"It's longer than 5 hours!  Did you know that?  This is not a good thing.

It's ridiculous.  They don't have any ""secrets.""  All they did was chase, with a camera, 5 different people who were setting up a Rush show:  the lights guy, the sound guy, the effects guy, the instruments guy, and the road manager.  I simplify a bit, but that's basically it.

Do we really need to hear about how the road manager arranges hotels for Rush tours?  Sheesh.  Or what vegetables Geddy's personal chef is making for him?  Documentaries about the influences on and development of their music are one thing, but if your level of interest in the band extends to wanting to know who among the road crew considers himself ""Geddy's friend"" and who doesn't, then I suggest you have psychological problems.

I've always considered myself an enormous Rush fan, but this is the limit.  It would have been much more interesting if they had edited it down to an hour, an hour and a half.  But five hours!  You're gonna be completely sick of this by the time you're done watching it.  It's longer than Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace""!",1395532800,2,1104,4.584615384615384
