8049214,4,B0007NC97W,"These three shows are a trip down memory lane, including the ads for Mazola Oil (""saturated fat"" was the watch-word in the '60s), and other products, with an opening song and dance number from the Jack Boyle dancers, David Rose and his Orchestra, and a ""warm-up"" from Red, and of course, a main skit that features a guest star.

In the first episode John Carradine is guest star as Gregory Grumbacher, and the theme is the art world, where Clem Kadiddlehopper becomes a famous New York artist, and there is a ""bit"" he does with a ladder that is priceless.

The second episode is the best and is about two sailors; it is laugh-out-loud hilarious, with a riotous Jamie Farr as guest, as Jamie and Red find themselves on a South Seas island, and think they are alone...not !

The third episode, ""Half a lawyer is better than none"" (there are plenty of ""short jokes"" in this one) features Mickey Rooney as Perry Mason-Jar, an out of work attorney, making sure Red becomes his client. There are also a few Kennedy jokes, so this one must be from the early '60s.

Red Skelton (1913-1997) did vaudeville, radio, film and TV, and his TV show lasted for 20 years (1951-1971) and was second only to ""Gunsmoke"" in popularity.

These shows are fun to watch, and are certainly a time capsule of the early days of television. The Vina DVDs can be obtained for less than the cost of a cup of coffee at your local discout retailer, and the quality is rather like watching TV in that era, so it's a good deal, and you're guaranteed some laughs. The box says the format is ""color"", but it is ""b&w"", and total running time is 90 minutes.",1110672000,3,1618,4.4711864406779664
