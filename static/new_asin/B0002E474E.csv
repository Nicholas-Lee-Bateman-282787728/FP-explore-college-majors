8027101,4,B0002E474E,Interesting  differant moves than most martial arts DVD.  Too many young kids in it.,1457308800,,84,4.928571428571429

8027104,4,B0002E474E,this is a rare look at a martial art that usually does not have competitions the demos were good even the ones done by kids that must be only around 6 or 7 what was really good was a chance to see some sparring which was interesting it was taekwondo with sweeps and takedowns,1185926400,,275,4.111111111111111
8027105,4,B0002E474E,"It has good demo's and ok fighting.  It looked like taekwondo with takedowns.  Olympic taekwondo is more exciting because they throw faster, better kicks without the worry of being  swept or taken down. It was still fun to watch because there are very few hapkido tournaments in the world.",1125100800,2,289,4.857142857142857
