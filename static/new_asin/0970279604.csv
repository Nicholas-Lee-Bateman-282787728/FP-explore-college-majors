7794167,5,0970279604,"This is a tape of the highlights of the Truth Tour running from 1.28.96 to 12.15.96.  It is a very technical exhibition of fighting compared to many UFCs with much less striking and palm strikes intead of closed fists.  A couple of veterans of UFC like Bas and Frank Shamrock who each have two fights each. The Bas Rutten/Masakatsu Funaki match is as brutal as I have seen.  Jason DeLucia shows great heart in both matches.  Only downside is that it is only 1:25 in length.  Overall, though, a great tape with Frank Shamrock being knocked out against Yuki Kondo and Bas Rutten dominating.",970876800,9,588,4.615384615384615
