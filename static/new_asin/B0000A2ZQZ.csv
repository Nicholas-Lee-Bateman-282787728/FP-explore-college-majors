7995512,5,B0000A2ZQZ,Monique is a favorite but the movie certainly brought out things that go on in the dark that you know is there but never wanted to visit. Watching the twists to this movie were great and as I said Monique it one of the best.,1358294400,,224,4.0

7995514,3,B0000A2ZQZ,"I saw the unrated version years ago on VHS. This version was pretty hot and it was actually a little better than what I expected. Although the unrated version was consisdered Soft Core, it kinda pushed the envelope, paticularly in a long scene between Monique Parent and Julie Strain. I don't know about the rated version as I tend to look for the invarible Unrated versions of these things. I saw Monique Parent in a little thing called Playtime in an unrated format on VHS as well that was hot. The unrated version is probably much better than the Rated version.
