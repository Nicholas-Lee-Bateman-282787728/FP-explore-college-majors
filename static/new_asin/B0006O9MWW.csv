2190040,5,B0006O9MWW,"I have to admit, I had never heard of Call on Me or Ministry of Sound until I read a post about this DVD on an exercise blog. The review made it sound interesting and entertaining so I looked it up on Youtube (in case you're curious, the entirety of this video is available, albeit cut up into 8 sections). I tried it out by streaming it through my TiVO and found it kind of strange the first couple of times I tried it given the outfits, the pelvic thrusting, etc. However, on about my third workout, I was seriously hooked. I have been trying to get serious again about regular exercise for over 3 years and this DVD was what helped me finally accomplish that. Don't get me wrong, this DVD is not easy. I find it harder than any Jillian Michaels DVD but it's a million times more fun. The Pump It Up section especially is killer but the dance moves from the Call on Me video at the end are crazy fun and a nice treat for making it through the hard cardio. The dance moves flow quickly from one to the other but after a few workouts, you pick it up and then don't have to suffer through the explanations every time afterwards like most exercise DVD's. Deanne Berry is truly the most likable instructor I've ever found, energetic and encouraging without grating.  Also, I can't describe enough what a difference it makes to workout to music you actually recognize rather than some generic instrumental pop or electronic.  To be honest, I wasn't really looking to lose weight when I started using this DVD, but wanted to tone up and improve my cardiovascular endurance.  After three months of regular use, at least three times a week, I'm starting to see some definite changes. I've lost an inch off my hips, dropped a jeans size, and my arms and legs are looking more toned.

The video itself is pretty basic and there is one brief part in the dance section that is edited incorrectly to what Deanne is instructing. However, it's only about 30 seconds and otherwise, I haven't found any other major mistakes. After a solid month of use without getting sick of it, I finally ordered my own copy and um, figured out a way to get my American DVD player to play a Region 2 disc. I like that I can skip around in the workout, so if I'm feeling a bit tired, I skip the Pump It Up section or mix up the order for something different.  I've since ordered Pump It Up: Burn It, Lose It (also Deanne Berry) and just ordered some of the Gareth Walker MoS DVD's to try something a bit different.  If you like a dance-based exercise video, then definitely check this out!",1332460800,6,2557,4.372631578947368
2190041,5,B0006O9MWW,"There were a lot of negative reviews for this series, but I tried them anyway.

I have to say this is the best workout video I've ever used.

Most of the complaints said things like: ""it was too hard,"" ""couldn't get the dance moves down,"" ""didn't explain well,""

I think the real problem is this heavier on the dance end, than other workout vids. It's also extremely high intensity, so if you're mediocre in the fitness realm (and you have no hopes of putting yourself to the ultimate fitness test), then this series may not be for you.

But if you need some high energy and fun, and are able to learn dance combinations, then this is really fun! This woman works your butt off.

Also, if you like the club music and Deanne Berry (the blonde in this vid), checkout her Club Mix: Work It Out dvd, too. It's even more fun, and way more fun dance moves than this, then it's a really detailed, high disciplined tae kwan do section, and the bums and tums is fantastic!! Really challenging! Different exercises.",1328054400,11,1005,4.469945355191257
2190042,5,B0006O9MWW,"This video is VERY inspring!  It makes you want to get up and dance with the group. From the music to her presentation, to the steps to the beauty of every single girl (and one guy)...you are INSPIRED! I find this not too hard, but not so easy that you get bored. The moves get all the muscle groups. She tells you precisely what you need to do the first time through, then prompts you when you go through the routine the next times. Their music has a great beat, and they are hits I recognize. She is an odd mix of wholesome but very sexy, with that Aussie accent and all. Buy this! You won't even think of it as exercise....just wonderful, fun, exercise that makes you break a sweat! Don't get me wrong, you get a workout, but it's fun. Midway through is a latin flavor dance routine for added fun.",1325980800,2,800,4.228758169934641
2190043,5,B0006O9MWW,"The Ultimate Dance Workout is what me and my workout buddy call ""the hard workout"" and we try to do it once a week. The dancers are all gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing, pulled right from the dance scene.

Far before the cardio portion you will be sweating, beginning with the very fun workout and into the dance portion. The ten minutes of pure cardiovascular activity is killer, but totally worth it! The workout is so complete it has a ""bums and tums"" section that focuses on the two main trouble spots we are all trying to work. Even this section is set to great music. It ends with a nice cool down.

The whole workout runs about an hour and is worth every minute. If you are willing to put the time and effort in, you will see amazing results. It only helps that the dance moves are fun and there is NO WAY you can be bored!

Definitely purchase!",1325635200,3,858,4.283950617283951
2190044,5,B0006O9MWW,"This is definitely one of the best dance videos of all time. The music is fantastic, instructor Deanne Berry is sweet, the dancers look and dance very well. I would recommend anyone looking to lose weight and have fun at the same time to get this DVD!  [...]",1298678400,5,258,4.375
2190045,5,B0006O9MWW,"This workout video is so much fun and it really gives me a great workout towards the end. I sweat and ran out of breath. Just remember not to pause too much but drink plenty of water. You can always add your own workout, like sit ups/crunches after the whole video (if you desire). But this video is complete from warm-up, salsa, heavy upbeat workout, stretching to cool down. I just love this workout video. The music makes it a plus; it's very energetic and you will not get bored at all! When I'm busy and I couldn't go to the gym. I workout at night with this. I definitely recommend this.",1287014400,10,593,4.303571428571429
2190046,5,B0006O9MWW,"I love this workout DVD! In fact I wake up in the morning all excited about doing the routines... again! Yes it's that addictive. I personally love electronic music and therefore, this DVD is perfect - it has a lot of famous dance tracks that everyone loves.

It's divided into several sections, so you can always choose the ones if short on time:

1) Warm up - about 8-10 minutes
2) Dance Section - about 20 minutes
3) High Energy - another 20 minutes
4) Bums and Tums - about 10 minutes
5) Cool Down - about 15 minutes

I do 30 minutes of cardio in the gym, so usually when I choose to workout with this DVD I'd do the warm pp and then high energy. I find the dance section less challenging, and I like to do the difficult part first, so I always do the high energy first and then if I have extra time, I'll do the dance section.

Deanne is very encouraging (in fact she is called Ms. Motivator now I think), although she does not give proper ""warning"" about what's coming up sometimes. But as you get familiar with the routine, you know what to expect next.

Overall this is my favorite workout DVD I have to say. I highly recommend it!
mend it.",1252540800,24,1148,4.2
2190067,3,B0006O9MWW,"Was as delightfully cheesy as expected but offers little to no guidance. They jump right into it and if you don't have any experience with aerobics, you'll never keep up.

2190076,3,B0006O9MWW,Got to see it on youtube but not on the DVD.  The DVD wouldn't play on my DVD player. From what I saw on youtube it was silly but it was a decent workout. I couldn't help but laugh at the guy and the girl in the back ground. The workout wasn't boring a bit silly but it got me moving. So make sure you have the right DVD player for this DVD type.,1406505600,,346,3.675675675675676
2190087,5,B0006O9MWW,I love this DVD workout lead by Deanne Berry.  You will get a full workout with this video.  It starts off with a stretch and then a warm up slowly getting you ready for a full cardio workout following a cool down.  I love this workout becasue it does not strain your muscles by jumping right into hard pounding workout without your body warming up first.  Sometimes I feel like I'm back at Bally's gym having a great group workout.,1392854400,,432,4.3625

""PUMP IT UP"" lived up to its name as I have never ""pumped it up"" to the magnitude in which I did.  The music is great, the scenery is great, the instructor and [most] of the helpers are great!!  If you're looking for a workout that will make you wanting to come back for more, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS VIDEO!!",1389657600,,462,4.043956043956044

I inserted it in to my tv and got a message that it was unable to read the data on this disc. so I thought that it might be just my dvd player, so after that, I tried it in my psp3 and it did the same thing! I tried messing with the settings in my psp3 and the settings in the dvd player, but nothing worked.in the very end the only place this product would play was on my labtop and even then there was something that I had to mess with.

I should have returned it! It only works if I put it in my computer and play it on there. So 2 stars to the seller or whoever made this dvd because it doesn't work in dvd players! :( I really wanted to watch it on my big screen.

It's hard to find the perfect dance workout.  Everyone is different.

I really haven't given this product a fair chance.
I haven't worked out in sometime and I admit that I'm really out of shape.
I was looking for something that was more for the beginner that would progress in levels to an advanced workout.
I think this work out is geared more to the intermediate level and above in workouts.

I am not saying it's not a good video, one can always stop when they've had enough,
but for the feeling of accomplishment and self satisfaction, we want to finish a workout and it wasn't possible for me.
A Good workout, but just not for the out of shape beginner.",1344297600,,770,4.510791366906475

It is  more of a challenge than another  beginning or dance aerobics workouts, and it's not too tough on your knees. Deanne Berrry is a talented leader and I am sorry she hasn't done more videos.

I admit, it was hard to catch on at first, but like anything else, you just have to practice.

I started out slowly and awkwardly as the steps were challenging for me but the challenge is what kept me coming back.  I love Deanne Berry and her crew and unlike some reviewers, there's nothing about her I find ""annoying"".  I've been able to increase my usage of this workout video to a frequency of 1- 3 days/week.  I alternate this with lower impact Richard Simmons ""party off the pounds""  DVD once or twice a week.  Some nights I just plain walk but regardless this MOS vid is a blessing.  Stick with it.  Hit pause if you have to.  Take water breaks.  Just don't give up.  This video gave me confidence with dance moves so I have ordered Gareth Walker's MOS 'Body Burn'  just a week or so ago.  I LOVE MOS. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.
