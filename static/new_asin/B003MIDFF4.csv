8400413,4,B003MIDFF4,I love this show and am happy to be able to purchase and play region 2 dvds. It loses 1 star because the product packaging is pretty bad. The case has a spindle in the center onto which the 4 discs are placed. It is extremely difficult to remove the discs from the spindle. I have never seen a container like this before. I hope subsequent series are packaged in a more conventional way.,1361491200,,387,4.243243243243243
8400414,1,B003MIDFF4,These discs will not play on any U.S. Blue Ray player--even a new one!  Advertisements should make this clear to the reader.,1360195200,3,124,4.636363636363637
8400415,3,B003MIDFF4,"It's a pity, but this Dutch Pal import has all episodes shortened by approx 10 minutes. The cutting has been done ""gently"", but leaves some strange ellipses.
No subtitles other than Dutch ones.
Otherwise good quality.",1338595200,8,217,5.055555555555555
8400416,5,B003MIDFF4,"Don't underestimate Detective Superintendent Inspector Andy Dalziel, under that pugnacious exterior is a ferocious intelligence. Warren Clarke is marvelous as the robust and uninhibited-itchy Dalziel. Yorkshire is not the charming, murderous environs of Midsomer, nor the rarified sphere of Inspector Morse's Oxford. No. This series features mysteries with the roughness of the rolling Yorkshire dales and Dalziel's formidable form. To quote the Fat Man, ""A man who can play the bagpipes shouldn't have trouble with this job."" Colin Buchanan convincingly contrasts as Detective Inspector Peter Pascoe, trying to cope with balancing work and life. It's worth making it to the standout Series 7, with continuing themes from Andy and Peter's lives, and real character development. Beware, with Series 8, the series slopes into weary decline.

The Unwanted: In beautifully filmed countryside, we finally peer inside Peter Pascoe's uncomfortable family; his father is a grouchy Yorkshire farmer. Migrant workers are targeted for discrimination, while another farmer attempts to create a dynasty. Peter must deal with his parents' problems, and Andy's troublesome health.

Men's Sana: An outstanding episode in the entire series/seasons, with wonderful music, Fat Andy exerting himself in a spa, and a poor badger.

Sins of the Father: A mysterious wood has a healing Angel tree. This story has a moving exploration of Andy's relationship with his sister, family secrets are explored. The sins of the Church towards orphans ripples through generations.

For Love Nor Money: Well-directed by fine actor Warren Clarke (Dalziel)! Pascoe is manipulated into questioning the Fat Man, who does a fine turn bouncing up and down on a trampoline; vintage Dalziel.

Fans of the Fat Man, you are not alone. Even in the U.K., for some bizarre reason, you can't get further Dalziel & Pascoe Seasons without Dutch subtitles, and Dutch product/story descriptions! Series 6 - 11 are available, even though they're formatted for Region 2. Series 6 and 7 will satisfy your craving for more, but by Series 9, the show drastically declines in quality (also noted by U.K. reviewers).

The DVDS: The soundtracks are in English. It's easy to turn-off the Dutch subtitles by going to ONDERTITLS on the main menu, and selecting UIT, very simple. Even in the U.K., viewers have to do this, since the Series isn't available even in the original BBC format. The Dutch are keeping Dalziel & Pascoe alive. I know several residents of Amsterdam, archaeologists and fanatical fans of U.K. mysteries, who stay up late into the night watching shows like this. Now, we're enjoying MORE marvelous Dalziel and Pascoe without having to wait for updated or Region 1 versions.

The DVD Player: Get yourself a DVD player with Region-Free capacity, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-DVP3560-All-Region-1080p-HDMI-Upconverting-DVD-Player/dp/B004BI6MVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips DVP3560 All Region 1080p HDMI Upconverting DVD Player</a>, but order a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-6-5-Feet-2-0-Meters/dp/B003L1ZYYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters)</a>&nbsp;with it, as this important component is not supplied! Or get another brand of HDMI cable, they're all ok. If all you want is to play your U.K. or other DVDS, that's all you need, don't worry about the other plug-ins that come with the DVD player. BUT be sure to read how to get the DVD player Region-Free with instructions posted by the first reviewer (S. Hatayama). When you enter the numbers as he instructs, you won't see a change on-screen until the Region Code pops up, don't worry, his instructions are perfect. To adjust picture-size on screen (mine was too stretched out), just hit the zoom button on the remote until it fits your screen. ""Setting"" will give you high-resolution choice - my old T.V. is 1080i. If the picture is too black (I had to go +5 to see all the details, you may need more/less), up the brightness under the ""Personal"" choice in Picture (Standard, Bright, Soft, Personal) menu. Good luck!",1335225600,15,4219,5.676703645007924
