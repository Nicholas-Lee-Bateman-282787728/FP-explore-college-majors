8001995,4,B0000E6EKZ,"Robson Green may hold the patent on tormented detective types.  He does not play an official policeman in this adaptation of the book of the same title.  He is a psychologist who is drawn into the mad world of the sociopath by his relationship with the police.

This adapation is actually better than the novel it is based on.  In the novel there is very little suspense as to who the killer is, the television show is far more convoluted and atmospheric with some very clever camara work.  I take leave to doubt that the opening sequence could actually happen but it is horrifically effetive.

Fans of Prime Suspect or Patricia Cornwell's early novels should take note.",1090972800,4,670,4.683760683760684
8001996,5,B0000E6EKZ,"If you loved Wire in the Blood:  Mermaids Singing, then you'll love Wire in the Blood - Shadows Rising! Dr. Tony Hill and Detective Inspector Carol Jordan are on the hunt once again for a serial killer with a taste for young teenage girls while having to deal with an assignment involving threats against a popular celebrity. Crime scenes show two distinctive kill patterns.  Is this the work of one or two murderers? Watch the dvd to find out!
A very creative screenplay with a very scary killer.
Highly recommend this to all who thirst for intelligent mysteries.",1073779200,4,564,4.744897959183674
