7899959,3,7798978127,"It would have been hard to top the original and IYATO 2 certainly tries, but that's the problem. Like so many sequels, they simply re-do what worked in the original and then do it twice as much.

The story picks up where the first one left off as You and Qi's characters are trying to figure out what to do with what they have. As in the first one, there is excellent writing about relationships as well as greater life philosophies and enough laughs to satisfy. However, the final half hour is so over-the-top that it is practically maudlin. Sure it was sad and tearjerking, but after a while, I simply wanted it to stop and move the story forward.

If you haven't seen the first one, I highly recommend that you do so. Immediately. Then, if you can catch this one fairly cheaply (via Amazon on-line rentals as I did), give it a try and do a comparison. You won't regret watching it, but you'll also see how it came up short.",1326412800,2,926,4.3468208092485545
