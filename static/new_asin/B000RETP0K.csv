2865045,4,B000RETP0K,"All of the biographies in this series are well done! The photographs, videos, and interviews create greater insight into the person being profiled. I was hoping to learn more about Grace Kelly's time as a princess, but most of the documentary was her time in Hollywood.",1368144000,5,269,4.869565217391305
2865046,5,B000RETP0K,"""Grace Kelly, The American Princess"" is an earnest and heartfelt tribute to a woman whose talent greatly impacted the nation and the world. An illuminating look at a captivating actress!",1359417600,3,186,5.233333333333333
2865047,3,B000RETP0K,"Made in 1987, GRACE KELLY: THE AMERICAN PRINCESS was one of the first major documentary projects to detail Kelly's remarkable Hollywood career and later life as Her Serene Highness, Princess Grace of Monaco.

Warmly narrated by future A&E Biography stalwart Richard Kiley, the documenary has interviews with the ""usual suspects"", including friend/bridesmaid Rita Gam, Judy Balaban Quine, director Delbert Mann and producer Stanley Kramer.  It's great to have some insightful interviews with some of Grace's surviving co-stars, too (Louis Jourdan from ""The Swan"" and Jimmy Stewart from ""Rear Window"").

Soft-pedaling some of the more controversial aspects of Grace's Hollywood life (such as her parade of male lovers), this documentary is much more a loving tribute than it is a tawdry expos.  There's lots of great footage from her movies and some rare Kelly family clips that have rarely been used anywhere else.  This documentary had the blessing of the Kelly family estate, and Grace's younger sister Lizanne participates in the interviews.

Recommended for fans.",1298592000,7,1066,5.469512195121951
2865048,3,B000RETP0K,"A precious picture of childhood of Grace is collected in this DVD.
However, there are comparatively few pictures of her thing and is dissatisfied slightly.

2865091,4,B000RETP0K,Very enjoyable story.  The photos and film really give you a feel for her as a person.  So much is about what others thought and knew.  Would have liked a little more insight from her in the form of letters or old interviews.  Perhaps she was just a private person and that was all you could know about her.  Her elegance is very intriguing.,1400284800,,341,4.265625
