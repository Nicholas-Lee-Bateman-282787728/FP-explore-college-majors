8042085,4,B0006OMBGG,"Good movie.  Love David Niven and Mifune.  Kid was cute. Good story line.  A little hokey as for the bad guys, but I have no problem with that.
Way too much blood and guts in today's movies.",1516060800,,190,4.081081081081081

8042093,4,B0006OMBGG,"An enjoyable tale of a school teacher who takes a job tutoring a Japanese Ambassador in Thailand.  The likeable teacher is a ""paper tiger"" in that he likes to tell courageous stories to people as he masquerades as a former ""Major"" and tells brave tales to anybody who will listen.  His young student is in awe of him.  Then they are kidnapped by revolutionaries and he is faced with a dilemma as his talking faces reality and his young protegee looks on. A good role for David Niven.",1411171200,,483,4.465909090909091
8042094,5,B0006OMBGG,"The story is admittedly very simple:  elderly British ""Major"" Walter Bradbury (David Niven) is engaged by the Japanese ambassador to an unnamed Southeast Asian country, Kagoyama (Toshir Mifune) as tutor to his enchanting 11-year-old son Koichi (Kazuhito Ando).  ""Mister Bladbelly"" soon wins the reverence of the ever-trusting and perfectly-mannered Koichi by spinning yarns about his heroic wartime exploits that could hardly be further removed from his quiet nonentitous life, but is unexpectedly and severely put to the test when they are both kidnapped by guerillas.

However simple though, the story is still a good one and it is fantastically well and charmingly acted by all three of the main characters. Anybody who has known a paper tiger, especially the more amiable types who, like Niven, have twinkles in their eyes gently hinting at their harmless fraud, will surely warm to his authentic depiction of one.

Paper Tiger is a gripping story, alternately funny, tense and moving, but above all it is a thoroughly warm-hearted and tenderly told tale of redemption.
