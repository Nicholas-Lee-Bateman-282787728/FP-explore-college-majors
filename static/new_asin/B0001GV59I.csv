You'll follow the pups on their adventures, learn interesting facts about each specific breed, and enjoy the lighthearted soundtrack to accompany it.  There's a cute, colorful animated character throughout to introduce each new segment.

However, the voice chose to do the NARRATION is both annoying and difficult for children to easily understand, and after 10 minutes, my two youngsters lost all interest in listening.

I don't know what the director was thinking to cast a child with such an obnoxious ""baby-ish"" voice with barely audible pronunciations of simple words.  It's like listening to a nursery school child try to read from a First Grade level book...it just doesn't sound good.

I guess PUPPIES AT PLAY is acceptable entertainment, but thanks to a terrible choice of voice over, this one won't last long in our cherished video collection.",1114041600,,923,5.1610738255033555
