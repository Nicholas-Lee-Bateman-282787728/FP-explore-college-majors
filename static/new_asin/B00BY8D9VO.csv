5681793,5,B00BY8D9VO,"This Pat Boone service comedy is like the movie ""Everything's Ducky"", also with Buddy Hackett, but this time featuring a pelican instead of a duck...and it also has Boone croon a few tunes during his heyday.  Now they need to get 2 more Pat Boone movies on DVD: ""The Horror Of It All"" and ""Mardi Gras"".",1369872000,3,302,4.392857142857143

5681797,5,B00BY8D9VO,Pat Boone and Buddy Hackett - both are fantastic actors and come together for a great comedy.,1438732800,,93,4.529411764705882

5681800,5,B00BY8D9VO,Wonderful and funny show - especially since it stars my father's ship from World War II.  Buddy Hackett is hilarious.,1422316800,,117,4.85
5681801,1,B00BY8D9VO,"Oh, it's bad...oh yes, indeed. It stinks, and to prove it, the company that released it over fifty years ago won't even give it the decency of a faithful presentation, even though they initially greenlit the coin in the first place (God only knows why) to film it in CinemaScope.  This is Fox's slap-in-the-face to the consumer who is dumb enough to spend hard-earned money for a junk product that the production company obviously no longer believes in, and probably never did (and honestly, who can blame them?  This is an awful movie, rivaling the worst of the beach pictures some three years later).  Fox should be ashamed to release such full-screen drivel, and you, the consumer, would be wise to avoid being suckered into paying for such an inferior product.  Truly deserving of the bottom of the poop-deck.",1419724800,,813,4.827338129496403

5681804,5,B00BY8D9VO,I love most military based movies.  This is a great movie about a Navy ship that has a turkey stealing the show.,1417478400,,112,4.090909090909091
5681809,4,B00BY8D9VO,A fun movie that kept me laughing.  A great choice for everyone in the family.,1410048000,,78,4.2

5681813,4,B00BY8D9VO,"Absolutely horrified that a Cinemascope production was rendered into the JUNK category by converting is to Pan and Scan.
There should be a law against this kind of chicanery. We all have High Def TV's with wide screen capability these days so the ""This movie has been resized to fit your screen"" caption is obsolete.",1405987200,4,316,4.763636363636364
5681814,5,B00BY8D9VO,I enjoy watching this movie,1405728000,,27,4.6
5681815,4,B00BY8D9VO,"OK mild musical comedy.  Always liked it.  Pat Boone is good-looking, sings nice, and is EXTREMELY clean-cut.  Barbara Eden is at her loveliest.  Buddy Hackett is irritating and probably somewhat offensive to Native Americans.  The DVD-R transfer is excellent.  The quality is beautiful.  Movie is nice little time-passer.  Recommended.",1402876800,,336,5.714285714285714
5681816,2,B00BY8D9VO,"""All Hands On Deck"" (1961) is simply one of Norman Taurog's worst films, his usual rather forced slapstick being irkingly annoying rather than funny.  Pat Boone is just okay warbling some more unmemorable tunes as the star with Barbara Eden not quite hitting her stride yet and she is stymied under Taurog's direction as the love interest.  They later teamed again in ""The Yellow Canary"" ,"" a thriller, also for 20th.  Dennis O'Keefe is plain awful and Buddy Hackett has never been so irritating as an Indian in the Navy with an unbelievable financial backing making his witlessly irascible antics given center stage making one painfully stupid movie.  It makes his performance in ""Muscle Beach Party"" deserving of an Oscar.  The movie was filmed in Cinemascope and is presented here in pan & scan from 20th Century-Fox's Cinema Archives Collection.",1397347200,7,849,5.035714285714286
5681817,5,B00BY8D9VO,I saw this movie around 20 years ago once I realise I could purchase it that is exactly what I did.  I still love sitting watching it with family and laughing at the antics of Buddy Hackett,1389744000,,189,4.108108108108108
5681818,1,B00BY8D9VO,"I'd LOVE a copy of this film... just NOT in the ""as-seen-through-a-keyhole""
modified to fit your square, glass screen, CRT, ancient TV set processing.

I'll probably NOT see this review in-print because I'll remind you of what
Spielberg calls t-h-a-t process: ""cra-po-vi-sion"".

Looks even worse on a widescreen TV; you can imagine WHAT you AREN'T seeing!",1378598400,15,355,5.321428571428571

8575312,5,B00BY8D9VO,"Barbara Eden is 110 in the shade.  Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

This is a Great Movie.  The image quality is excellent. Humorous and well acted.",1515888000,,740,4.638461538461539

8575318,4,B00BY8D9VO,"Romantic comedy set aboard LST 1096 St Clair County based in Long Beach Navy Yard.  The story may be considered dated and politically incorrect by today's standards, but there should be enough footage of the ship to interest naval buffs.

8575320,1,B00BY8D9VO,"Fox should be fined by the Government for false adverting. How dare they continue to release CinemaScope films, with the CinemaScope logo on the front box artwork, with a 4:3 transfer. Old square TV's are no longer in use.

Why do some people review these films and honour them with stars.....amazing how this is still on-going.

Avoid ALL FOX ARCHIVE release and stay with WARNER ARCHIVE where you receive a terrific if not satisfactory print always in the correct ratio and wherever possible, stereo and now even 5.1 sound, as they re issue previously released films.",1454025600,,569,4.916666666666667
