8357809,2,B0029F2MV4,"This DVD did not include any background information on the fire ceremony nor did it describe the meaning of the actions or chants that were included in the ceremony. The production quality was very, very basic (think home movies). I expected more for $45. If someone wants to watch a fire ceremony, this DVD will meet the bill (if you ignore the editing). However, if you are looking to learn about the fire ceremony and its components, this will NOT meet your needs. I'm glad they shared the ceremony, but would appreciate something more instructive.
