Very good product to support your kid with amblyopia",1442016000,,64,4.909090909090909
8349577,1,B0021ZX35G,"This DVD looks like a really cheap made home video.  My son was interested in it for about, uhh...2 seconds. I almost threw it in the trash.  Waste of money.",1307923200,,157,4.2

She has not been resistant to wearing one, but the writeup on this DVD sounded good so I got it. She found it noisy, the puppets not very appealing, and mostly she could not  make out most of the words, which we also found garbled, so we could not help her out. Also, the theme stressed that children do not like wearing an eye patch and we never approached her with that idea, which may be why she has not complained about it. We finally turned it off before we got to the ""sing-a-long"" since we could not figure out what the words to the song were. This ended up as a not cheap children's DVD that we will not even play all the way through once.",1298332800,,742,4.0476190476190474

I wish the library had this to rent instead. If fact, that's where I'll be donating our copy!",1287014400,,249,4.813953488372093
