6554546,3,B00M31VF2G,"My main issue with the VH1 TLC Biopic is the way Left Eye was portrayed.

Lil Mama did a great job acting wise. They all did. However, the script that was written. There was just too many inaccurate stories with Lisa.

For one, they made Left Eye look like she was being selfish when they wouldn't go with her ideas on the ""Creep"" video set and that's not true.

Left Eye was going to wear the black tape over her mouth to protest the song since the song is about cheating and she was against cheating. Instead Lisa ended up doing a rap verse where she insulted the activity of creeping that ended up on the single

Secondly, They also made Lisa look like the only reason she went solo and did her solo album, Supernova was because she wanted out of the group. She didn't want out of the group. She wasn't able to fully express herself in TLC because a lot of TLC's songs didn't even have her vocals on it and She was against some of the songs that TLC recorded like ""Creep"" because she didn't agree with the messages behind the songs. She never wanted to quit TLC, she wanted to do a solo album so she could fully express herself

Reigndrop Lopes, Lisa's sister said the Lopes family wasn't involved in the movie. That's probably why there were a lot of inaccurate parts with her story.

last, They never explored when Chili met her dad the Sally Jessy Raphael Show or Lisa signing to Death Row Records as NINA.

This biopic movie left out a few things and could have been more accurate when it came to Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes' story

ALSO the Dvd is disappointing. the profanity is still censored.",1411948800,4,1597,4.353535353535354
6554547,5,B00M31VF2G,I will buy this as soon as possible! I cannot believe it's on dvd. I will love to watch this repeatedly because I never knew a lot about that group I was so young when they started out. I love this movie and it hope they release the Aailyah movie too from lifetime like other famous movies,1411862400,8,289,4.087719298245614
6554548,5,B00M31VF2G,"Beyonce who? CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story is a breathtaking retelling of the struggles and successes of the #1 selling female group in America.. TLC. The movie strikingly portrays the lives of Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins, Rozonda ""Chilli"" Thomas, and Lisa ""Left-Eye"" Lopes as they embarked on a journey to become one of the best successes in music. They recreated their iconic music videos to a point where I had to do a double take, each actress became their character, and we all fell in love again with TLC. Let us never forget the true legendary impact TLC made in music history. TLC is timeless, while acts today will fade over time.",1411430400,13,633,4.763636363636364

The things they went through in the music business was very sad, but the way they dealt with it, by pouring their souls out, through their music - shows a lot of strength, intelligence, discipline, and perseverance.",1486080000,2,388,4.287671232876712

6554581,5,B00M31VF2G,"Well, first of all, as great as TLC was/is, it is misleading to only say they are the ""best selling female group of all time"". In complete candidness, Diana Ross & The Supremes remain the ""Best Selling Female Group of Time"" with over 12/14-#1 gold/platinum singles extracting ranking averages from all 3 record business trade magazines and another dozen or so gold/platinum albums with 3 going to #1! TLC is the ""best selling group of the Soundscan era"". (The Supremes most potent sale period in the 60s were not captured by computer tally). Let's see if TLC will stil be ranking Top 30 albums a half century later as The Supremes presently do.
That said, ""CrazySexyCool"" is an entertaining journey of bad deals and massive success the young ladies both experienced. With 4 multi-platinum albums selling over 25 million + 2 additional Gold albums, these totals underscore their success in the Soundscan era.
Unlike what is rumored about The Supremes, TLC was indeed assembled by the ex-Pebbles Reid, looking for a female group to add to the roster. The ladies immediately captures the imagination of millions with their colorful hip hop/R&B music and apparel.
After a cold, rude awakening of being told despite selling 4 million plus on their debut album with 3/Top 10 singles, by album 2, the ladies demand and get more control of their career. Hence their 2nd album, not only avoids the classic sophomore slump, but, actually outperforms their debut with the near Diamond selling, ""CrazySexyCool"".
The cast is hauntingly perfect with each of the actresses giving very real portrayals of T-Boz, Chili and the egnimatic Left Eye. Their key producer, Dallas Austin, is played ironically with sly skill by Diana Ross' son (formerly lead singer of The Supremes), Evan Olaf Naess Ross. In a near wordless performance, Ross gives an Emmy-worthy performance.
The travels of the group is riddled with massive success and crippling handi-caps. They recreate their iconic music videos with near perfection despite a television budget.
Their third album, ""Fanmail"", creatively expands their base with alternative R&B/hip hop ensuring their success at T40 radio.
After the tragic, unexpected departure of key member, Left Eye, the ladies become a duo and achieves some success, but, to a limited degree.
There is a question mark of how well the ladies perform monetarily because their material success is just not equivalent to how well their career dominated the 90s.
A fun, excellent bio-pic that does a great job in reviving their music catalog.",1441065600,3,2537,5.086330935251799

I grew up in the age of TLC and really couldn't believe how perfectly these women portrayed the real ladies. I would definitely watch it more than once because it was nice to relive that time period in my life through the music, acting, and even real TV footage here and there.

6554597,5,B00M31VF2G,"Crazysexycool: The TLC story is one of the better biopics made in recent memory about one of the greatest female groups of all-time, TLC. The story and direction were great and I felt like the movie explained some of the legendary groups trials, tribulations, and triumphs in great detail. The three ladies who portrayed T-Boz (Drew Sidora,) Left Eye (Lil Mama,) and Chilli (KeKe Palmer) were perfectly cast and turned in strong performances. This is the biopic that will last, unlike that tragedy of an Aaliyah biopic that Lifetime aired last year.",1424908800,5,549,4.978260869565218

6554599,5,B00M31VF2G,"Among the many biopics, the TLC Story, in my opinion, is a very good production. The three young ladies that portrayed T-Boz, Left-eye, and Chili were excellent. Not only did the actors look like the real TLC, but they also had their personalities and mannerisms down pat.  TLC's story was told at a brisk, but thorough pace and included many well known episodes in their journey to become one the most successful female groups.  Also impressive was the overall production - no shoe-string budget for this movie. The music was also good and well utilized. A particular favorite scene was when Left-Eye does the math and explains why they were broke. The dialog was taken from an interview for a VH-1 Behind the Music segment, but is no less revealing as to how the music business works. If you're a TLC fan you will definitely want this DVD; if you're a casual fan this is worth watching to see the business side of the music industry.",1424563200,,935,4.626506024096385

Some say this movie shined a bad light on Lisa (Left Eye) but I do not think this was the case at all. This was a display of the truth and that is what Lisa would have wanted.
