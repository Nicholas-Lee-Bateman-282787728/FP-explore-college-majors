7892260,4,6305538557,"These episodes were really good, but not as good as some of the other Kid Rhino videos.  The first episode showcases the Autobots at their worst, and the second episodes animation is a little below par.  But, I still  recommend this video to anybody and everybody.",964051200,,264,4.695652173913044

7892262,5,6305538557,"The first episode of this video has the Autobots dealing with aclone of thier leader Optimus Prime and some very weird crystals. Thisepisode starts off in the orginal title format! This episode is my favorite as it have the title sequence I remember the most from watching the series in the 1980's! This video is a must for fans of the orginal ""Transformers""not ""BeastWars"" or ""Beast Machines""! To me these are the real ""Transfomers"" not some computer wannabe 's which don't even feel like the ones I grew up with! So remember buy this video if you are are fan of the original ""Transformers""!",954028800,7,592,4.701923076923077
7892263,5,6305538557,The mighty transformers I never thought would come back. I have alway loved the Transformers and the Beast Wars. They always give them such great animation and great adventures. It really does bring back alot of memorys  of what I used to watch. THE HAVE THE TOUCH AGAIN!,952732800,,271,4.645833333333333
7892264,5,6305538557,"Original TF-G1 episodes have been hard to come by until recently. They've been available on-line now for about a year and a half from Sunbow Productions in Canada.  But now Sunbow and Kid Rhino are releasing this  classic in the United States. And they're available here at Amazon.com!  <--- web site plug :-) Both of these episodes take place in  Transformers' second season when there was a mass surge in the creation of  adjunct teams on the show. The second season was also the peak in  creativity for the writers, as they searched for new ways to keep the story  of the pre-Cybertronian Transformer wars interesting. I really enjoyed the  episode selection for this volume.""A Prime Problem"" tells the  story of Megatron sneaking a duplicate Optimus Prime into autobot ranks to  lead them into a dangerous crystal-trap. The episode was a gem as far as  character-reinforcement. Optimus Prime as the patient leader who kept his  cool even when his very identity was on the line, and who's caring and  protective nature eventually restores his identity. Ironhide as the one to  step up and take charge during a crisis. And especially accurate was  Starscream, the impatient and unrealistic psycho-bot who's lack of wisdom  or backbone works against his plans for fame and glory... once again. In the  second episode, ""City of Steel"", Megatron dismantles the  foundation of the Empire State Building right out from under the building  (unlikelihood considering laws of physics notwithstanding), and features  some of the most haunting images of the Generation One series... especially  to a seven year old (which was how old I was when the show originally  aired). What awestruck child who sees Prime as the greatest leader of all  could forget the images of Prime's disembodied head, his body reconstructed  into a reptilli-con, and his own right arm set atop of the highest  skyscraper in all of New Cybertron! Making an always-welcome cameo are the  famous Constructicons, first seen in ""Heavy Metal War"" season one  (this episode is thankfully featured in the new Boxed Set, Vols. 4-6).If  you're a remeniscing fan, this video is well worth the price. If you're a  stickler for quality, there is a bit of disappointment in this series which  is obvious when comparing it with the Canadian releases. The Canada  editions have been remastered and look fantastic, but it seems that less  care was taken in preparing the US releases. At least the US versions don't  use ENTIRELY movie art on the covers of G-1 episodes! To a fan, this is a  no-no. :-)All in all though, this video well worth the cost for a fan, and  probably the best volume of the first three. Highly recommended for  purchase here at Amazon.com. If you found this review helpful, check out my  reviews for everything Transformers (including volumes two and three of  this pack... reviews for the second pack coming soon.)",951436800,10,2891,4.945833333333334
7892265,5,6305538557,"Well, there is not much one can say. I was a true transformers fan as a kid and now watching this brings many a tear to my eyes. This is by far the best daytime cartoon series ever made and these two episodes are a prime  example of the quality of the series. Get it right now, the best 9.95  you'll ever spend. Better yet, get the whole trilogy that was recently  released.",949190400,3,374,4.095890410958904
