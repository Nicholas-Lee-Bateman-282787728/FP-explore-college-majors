Hockey fans will love it, but I doubt the general public would understand what was going on, although if you are interested in Soviet Russia, then you might also enjoy it (spoiler: no one likes Brezhnev).  The acting is superb, Danila Kozlovsky is AMAZING as Kharlamov, and he looked just like him.  The actor portraying Tarasov was a good actor, but looked nothing like the actual person, so that was a little jarring to me.  It is a high-quality production, with typical moments of Russian cinema drama (slo-mo bull fights), and the bad guys (Canadians) are portrayed as bulls (and those guys could be considered bullies, so I guess it fits) that our hero defeats in epic fashion.  Subtitles are easy to follow.  There is an interesting point raised by the movie, that somewhat abusive ""coaching"" makes for players who in the end worship their abuser as their fatherly mentor, this movie's Tarasov makes Herb Brooks look like a poodle.  The ending takes events from different times and combines them for the sake of drama.  :::::spoiler alert::::::

Kharlamov's car accident was in 1976, the Summit Series with Canada was in 1972.  The Soviets won game one 7-3, but Kharlamov's ankle wasn't slashed until game 6, it was broken, he missed that game, game 7, and in game 8 his play was pretty ineffective.  But in this movie, this all gets mixed into a drama soup for the final sequence.  I also felt it ended too early, as some of the most heart-wrenching stuff in his life was yet to happen.  Still, if you are ignorant of these things, and just view this as a drama and not a docudrama, then all is well.  It's a great romp. After all, as it is said to be Putin's favorite movie, what's a little fabrication of the facts?",1435276800,,1772,4.67741935483871

8653911,4,B00JUWIKC4,"Awesome movie about Russia's best ever player. The ending is an astounding work of fiction, but a fun ride all the same. Kind of the Russian version of John Huston's outlandish but very fun ""Escape to Victory"" with Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine, and Pele.",1423699200,,259,4.909090909090909
8653912,5,B00JUWIKC4,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting and picture were excellent. It is a biographical movie about Russian ice hockey legend Valeri Kharlamov. The movie starts off with a short scene taking place in Spain (Kharlamov's mother was Spanish and he lived there before emigrating with his mother to the USSR). Then it follows his life as an up and coming young talent playing for an obscure team in a Russian industrial town to being drafted by the legendary coach Anatoli Tarasov to play for CSKA Moscow and eventually the Soviet national team. It follows various aspects of his life from fighting a serious career threatening injury, to meeting the love of his life, as well as being pursued by an authority figure to denounce Coach Tarasov in order to have him sacked. The highlight of the movie is the first game between the Soviet national team and the Canadian all-stars, an epic game in 1972, which changed the sport of ice hockey forever.",1421798400,4,942,4.75
