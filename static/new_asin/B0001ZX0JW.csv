2049920,5,B0001ZX0JW,"I was blown away by this low-budget, high quality film. While the cast and crew eschew a self-deprecating humor in reference to their own work (don't forget to see the ""interviews"" after the movie), the viewer's experience is one of appreciation and awe.

The movie does to the martial arts genre what ""Airplane"" did to mainstream Hollywood films, only better. The plot is a perfect vehicle for the physical humor, and subtly hilarious script of brilliant writers and cast members.

With satirical nods to the great cinema of the 20th century, Stutter keeps the viewer belly laughing while trying not to miss the next joke.

Also, Sam Manu is my hero.",1109635200,9,651,4.846846846846847
2049921,5,B0001ZX0JW,"I too saw this little gem at the Hawaii International Film Festival in 02 and have been waiting for this DVD ever since.  A big audience favorite.  I remember watching this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about.  As soon as the first actor starting talking, I knew this one was special.  I laughed throughout the whole thing.  I have never honestly laughed that hard ever.  Me and my friend kept hitting each other trying to stop each other from laughing.

Obivously making the best of every buck this sucker never lets up.  Everything is done so spot on professionally that you overlook the low budget nature.  There isn't much of story but it's so way over the top, witty, colorful, and creative that you can't but help smile at the chaos being thrown up on the screen...Truly a low budget work of art.

Total motivation for aspiring filmmakers who don't have money to spend but have big ideas for movies.  This is how it's done.

A definte must see!!!!",1093651200,9,965,4.546511627906977
2049922,4,B0001ZX0JW,"I saw this film in Hawaii at a film festival a few years ago and have been waiting for it to be released on DVD.  Tongan Ninja is totally hilarious.  Kung Pow was released around the same time and got a lot more attention which is a shame, cas Tongan is way funnier!  I dug the musical numbers and sight gags.  Totally recommend it if you want a good laugh.",1088985600,4,357,4.057142857142857
2049930,1,B0001ZX0JW,"After watching Flight of the Conchords, I thought I would give this a try.  Jemaine Clement was painful to watch in this... maybe one funny scene in the entire movie.  Now, I am one who loves terrible movies... but i realized they are usually the ones that are supposed to be serious... Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, etc...  This movie was not funny at all and I felt ashamed for having bought it.",1219622400,,395,4.458333333333333
2049931,4,B0001ZX0JW,"A bit disappointing that Jemaine is not in this movie as much as we had hoped, but overall its pretty entertaining especially if you can allow yourself to take it for what it is- a spoof on old ninja flicks with silly overdub and sweet moves :-)",1213574400,,245,4.23404255319149
2049932,4,B0001ZX0JW,"This movie is hilarious if you enjoy stupid humor. A great mockery of martial arts films and old school dubbed Asian imports. As long as you expect it to be bad, and realize it is bad for a reason, you will enjoy this!",1211846400,,218,4.093023255813954
2049933,4,B0001ZX0JW,"OK, I am admittedly an unabashed Jemaine Clement fan and think that Flight of the Conchords is one of the best comedy shows on TV right now.  But in all honesty, I really didn't have high expectations for this film at the beginning.  I thought it was likely to be a low-budget, testosterone-drenched, comedic tribute/spoof of Kung Fu movies.  And...well...yes, that's exactly what it turned out to be.  But to my surprise, it also turned out to be an amazingly entertaining film and one that had me in stitches at several points.  And it's OK if you're like me and aren't really that familiar with all the ninja stuff that's being alluded to throughout the plot.  All you need to appreciate this film is a sense of humor and an appreciation of the absurd.",1207958400,2,755,4.597014925373134
2049934,4,B0001ZX0JW,"I enjoyed this martial arts spoof film, but the best part was the ""Making of Tongan Ninja"" featurette in the special features.  The movie itself was quite silly with obvious overdubbing of english over english.  The featurette is done very comically as well.",1206576000,,258,4.976744186046512
2049935,3,B0001ZX0JW,"I would say that if you're a big fan of Jermaine and you like low-budget/semi-homemade films, then you should see this film. It's incredibly stupid but there are some great one-liners that you can take with you.  Be forewarned: the more you watch it, the more you'll like it.",1198886400,,275,4.612244897959184
2049936,5,B0001ZX0JW,"This movie is hilarious if you like silly comedy, which I do.  I also think Jemaine Clement is one of the funniest people around.  I recommend this movie, watch it!!!!!",1198195200,2,168,4.566666666666666
2049937,5,B0001ZX0JW,"This movie is totally tongue-in-cheek and over the top funny.  If you've ever watched a B-grade Martial Arts movie, plus any of a number of blockbusters over the past few decades, you'll get a kick out of it.  As a Kiwi living in the US, I appreciated the sly digs at NZ culture on top of all that.  Take nothing seriously in this movie and you will be laughing the whole time.  The good news is that now this is out on DVD, the rental shops are carrying it.  However it is so good, you will want to own it, to share with friends and families.  Enjoy!",1192665600,5,551,4.102803738317757
2049938,5,B0001ZX0JW,"This is a funny movie that FOTC; Jemaine Clement, stars in.  He won't be nominated for a 'supporting actor' award, but he is really good here. Worth the time to watch, he can dance too...",1188345600,,187,4.3428571428571425
2049939,4,B0001ZX0JW,"I started watching this thinking it was just going to be another one of those stupid ninja movies I get bored with after 10 mins and switch off... however, I soon found it was a comedy, and one that was actualy making me laugh and keeping my interest all the way to the end in whats been the most suprising comedy I've seen for a while.

Togan Ninja kicks off in a small charter plane where a guy is taking his son and another kid for a fly around the place, the kid in the back is a bad egg and decides to cut up some wires in the plane which causes them to crash land on an island somewhere in the south pacific. The father is then eaten by piranas and dies and the two kids end up being taken in by a group who then teach them the art of ninja... then 20 years later or so Togan is asked to go to New Zealand to help someone who is having a problem with a ninja syndicate that want to take over her grandfather resteraunt.

This New Zealand comedy is great, its funny in the slapstick kind of way, it's zanel and corney but enjoyable. There is some classic comedy lines, memorable scenes and laughs and is a-ok for the entire family to enjoy. It's a shame it's not a well-known title, it's sure to have been a hit in the comedy rentals if it had've been promoted (better?)

Hearing New Zealand and Australian voices for ninjas is a crack up... in a ninja fight where 100 bad-guy ninjas are circling the good guy and being beaton off one by one, you have to crack up laughing hearing a ninja with an aussie accent say, ""step aside ladies, let me have a crack at it""... if that sounds humours to you, you may well just like this comedy!",1154649600,2,1637,4.109375
8019283,5,B0001ZX0JW,although this is a low budget film it contains lots of clever subtle jokes.,1460764800,,75,4.428571428571429

8019288,5,B0001ZX0JW,"This NZ action-packed comedy gem is a keeper for sure. What's even sweeter is that I seized it at a bargain basement price. I loved this film not only for all its awkardness and subtle jokes, but also for some really hilarious dancing & musical bits. Still, the most memorable parts for me might be the great bonus features - theatrical trailers, commentaries with Jemaine, the director, Jason Stutter, and other key actors/voices in the film and the official ""Making of.."" with kiwi film luminaries. Would've loved to see more of the actor who played Tongan Ninja but can't have it all, I guess. See Hollywood, you don't need a billion dollars to make a truly great & original film if you load it with good writing and talented artists.",1271376000,,737,4.676923076923077
8019289,5,B0001ZX0JW,"c grade movie but still good.

and u only wanna watch the rest because the start was that funny, but its the only real funny part.
type tongan ninja into youtube for a trailer.
a definate must own.! the type u watch once, just because.
and never will watch again. lol.
i still rate it though :)",1252195200,,348,4.132352941176471
8019290,2,B0001ZX0JW,"First let me start off by saying I am a rabid Jemaine Clement fan.  I love Flight of the Conchords, and it was a youtube link that directed my attention to this movie.  After laughing at the humorous plot synopsis on the back of the case and reading the amazon reviews, I couldn't wait to pop this into my dvd player.  The intro song was a little catchy and silly with that trademark Jemaine type of humor, so I thought I was in for a treat.  Boy was I wrong.  This movie has maybe two parts that I might have chuckled at.  The fact that so many of the reviews on this site are so positive is completely astounding to me.  Its not even an interesting movie. I wanted to stop watching the movie 15 minutes into it, but I kept going in the hopes that things would get better.  Not the case.  The movie is littered with songs that make me feel like a complete dullard for even watching them.  They aren't funny at all, and the fact that Bret McKenzie co-wrote them makes it even harder for me to believe.  The characters aren't likable, and the movie just drags on.  The whole 'martial arts B-movie' shtick wears off long before the ending credits roll.  I really can't figure out what type of film fan I can recommend this to.  If you want a silly/b-movie/musical with shoddy production values, check out Cannibal the Musical. Sorry Conchords.",1239753600,6,1341,4.376518218623482
8019291,4,B0001ZX0JW,"Since they tell you themselves that they made this movie on their spare time on the weekend and the whole movie being dubbed, I didn't expect much.  I was happily surprised and disappointed, but laughing the whole way through.  Many of you may know Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords, he is Action Fighter, Tongan Ninja's bitter rival.  In that fashion there is several songs in this movie written by Jemaine and fellow band member Bret Mckenzie that don't disappoint.  Don't expect much in the fighting sequences either, this isn't Hollywood.  But there is a few surprises like a quite entertaining car chase scene. Overall, a funny movie, and being a fan of Flight of the Conchords makes it that much better.",1239235200,,720,4.821138211382114
8019292,4,B0001ZX0JW,"A pretty funny movie.
Their English on English over-dubbing is hilarious. Some of the filming is home-movie quality and must be dealt with, but the movie overall contains a few laughs that make it worth a watch. The best part of this DVD is the making of Mock-umentary. This film does well of making fun of martial arts films.",1239062400,,326,4.5423728813559325
