7909345,5,B00000I1PX,"Epic 80-minute video collection of  Earth views captured by astronauts on various space shuttle missions in sync with a relaxing instrumental soundtrack. Playback options include continuous loop playback & subtitles in 12 different languages that show the location you are looking at on Earth, the approximate direction of the north pole and the altitude of the shuttle when the scene was captured.",1478908800,,398,5.419354838709677

In agreement with other reviewer clouds and more clouds and more clouds predominated... ...  The DVD was returned",1333065600,,280,5.021739130434782

This set of overflight views is extremely repetitve. If I had made the DVD, I'd not be at all proud of it. It is just clouds, clouds, more clouds, a couple minutes of desert, back to clouds, clouds, clouds, clouds ..... It could make a beautiful 15-minute video. At 85 minutes, it's a joke.
As example, the 3 overflights of Brazil take almost 15 minutes alone and the entire time you can scarcely see a single ground feature. Just clouds. And clouds, and clouds ... for 15 minutes!
Maybe if you view this stoned, the views set to fairly nice music would be entrancing. But I wasn't stoned and my normal-speed brain kept wondering when I'd actually get to see something!
Maybe that's what the whole view really is. Probably. But I was expecting much, much more. With modern telephoto photography a spy satellite can see you mailbox from space. There was no real telephoto camera work here. A few zooms such as a amateur videographer could do with cheap equipment. That's all.
Bummer. Any commercial crosscountry flight is more interesting.
PS - After writing the above, I have had a change of heart.
1) I finally started looking at the screensavers. They are among the best I've seen. I like them all. These views are just exactly what I'd expected from the 85-minute video. They are maybe worth the price of the DVD, though rather pricey.
2) Also, the view of the earth, though as stated in my main review as boring and needing huge editing, it is nevertheless instructive. That is to say: we DO live on a water planet with a very thin envelope of habitable space. It is a view everyone needs to understand viscerally. Maybe it WOULD be a good idea to view the whole series of overflights, but preferably stoned or somehow in a deep meditative state. Once.",1074902400,7,1878,4.625748502994012
7909349,2,B00000I1PX,"This is not exciting or awe-inspiring.  The pictures are repetitive though well-photographed.  The music is mundane and boring.  There are far better examples of s[ace and music combinations.  The IMAX  'The Dream is Alive' is far superior, although it has narration.",1061596800,2,267,5.414634146341464
7909350,5,B00000I1PX,"When you're sick and tired of these filthy life on earth,
you may turn to this amazingly secluded world of 'earthlihgt"".
Some criticize it for its long coverage of water or oceans,
but it's the way the world exists. They needs to know more things of the real world?!
What a wonderful world!
It needs no addtion, no disguise, no distortion and no documentary footage.
Just as it is...
The earth is just simple, clear, bright and cool...
You would have heart of mercy on your fellow humankind.
Looking down from the heaven,
you may see not people's immeasurable sorrow, agony and bitter revenge,
 but their ephemeral achevement and transient joy...

I would like to recommend it.",1021766400,4,677,4.777777777777778
7909351,5,B00000I1PX,"Seeing tis magnificent Atlantis launch and hearing it in roaring 5.1 dolby is solely worth the price of the dvd. lus, you get many, many shots of our beautiful planet, crisply videotaped from the space shuttle missions. You get to see most part of the south emisphere of earth, along with USA at night, most Asia and Arabia and South America. Subtitles in more than 10 languages let you know what you are looking at, and the ethereal, space music really lets you get in the mood for watching, meditating or simply enjoying the pictures. Dont let it pass.",990576000,,554,4.606060606060606
7909352,1,B00000I1PX,"Unfortunately, the people at DVD International are fond of showing water shots in small screen, whereas this material cries out for land shots in widescreen.",963187200,3,157,5.32
7909353,2,B00000I1PX,"I bought Earthlight: Special Edition with much anticipation, as it was billed as the space shuttle view of earth.  I was disappointed in the video segments.  While it is true that 70% of the earth is water, there is  a limit to the interest generated by showing cloud formations over water.  70% of the video segments are over the Atlantic or Pacific ocean with no  land in sight.  Within these segments there are a few where you can see  land approaching and thats' where the video segment ends.  It's as if they  asked NASA,  ""What are the most uninteresting video segments you have  on all your shuttle missions.  We want to make a DVD out of them."".  That being said, the still photographs they have are marvelous.  They are all land or island shots.  The screen saver software will load  them on your HD.  They have additional stills available on the web site  that can be unlocked from the DVD after they are paid for.  Wait for  Earthlight: The Land Edition, if your interested in this sort of thing.",918950400,36,1007,4.5195530726256985
