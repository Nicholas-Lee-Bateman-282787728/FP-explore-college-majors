If you are a silent film purist, the Slingshot DVD will surely cause the hair on your neck to stand up.  The score is excellent, but of a modern style and totally out of character.  The titles (even the opening credits) have all been replaced by a modern style.  The original film  portion would rate 5 stars, but the slash and burn reconstruction detracts.

1328740,5,B00003ETJU,"The 1920 version of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is far and away the best screen version of this oft-filmed tale. In it's restored and tinted version it is a visual masterpiece, containing some of the most breathtaking scenic photography in movie history. What makes it truly great however is the fact that even after eighty years it refuses to be a ""dated"" antique. Far more emotionally complex than any of the other adaptions, particularly the Michael Mann version of the nineties, and much less sentimental. The drama can still grab a viewer by the throat and refuse to let go.  Highlights include the Massacre of the british fort as well as the finale set atop a huge cliff that is as tragic as it is thrilling.  The acting is uniformly excellent, even Beery as Indian villain of the piece. The direction by Tourneur and Brown is stunning.

Not only is it not restored at all (it's a fuzzy, gross PD-level transfer), it's in fact the 1936 sound version of LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Their box art and disc, as well as the product description here on Amazon, claim this is the 1920 Maurice Tourneur/Clarence Brown version, but pop the disc into your player and it's the 1936 George B.

Plus, Hawkeye is mostly behind the scenes. The focus is clearly on Uncas and the ladies (and the bad guy).

There is also a secondary villain who adds a bit of interest (and, for me, surprise) to the story. Montcalm is more honorable (... sort of...) in this version than in the 'revised' versions which have been the accepted mainstay since about  1934 or so (the first talky version, I believe).

The Last of the Mohicans is a fine adaptation of the novel, the format like successful silent movies relies on crisp texts neatly followed by the actual footage.

Magua is the villain here and the the relationship between Uncas and Cora is brilliantly portrayed just fantastic performance by all key characters.

The ending of the movie is particularly powerful with Chief Great Serpents thought - ""Woe for the race of red men!

1328784,3,B00003ETJU,"Last of the Mohicans, 1920 film

The novel by James Fenimore Cooper has been adapted to film often. This story begins in the summer of 1757 in the Hudson River Valley - the wild west of the 18th century. Two Indians go to warn the pale faces of danger. Fort Edward is an English outpost. Cora Munro and her younger sister Alice are visiting. An Indian brings news of the danger from the Hurons. The French are attacking Fort Willian Henry with their powerful army. Magua brings a message to Fort Edward asking for 3,000 soldiers. Colonel Munro's daughters will be sent to him with Magua as a guide. Troops and supplies depart the fort as reinforcements. Major Heyward and the Munro girls follow Magua on a path through the forest. A preacher joins them on the way.

How did their Indian guide lose his way? Hawkeye warns them the woods are no longer safe! They stay at a cave near Glenn's Falls. The morning brings an attack. They fire their muskets then retreat. The Munro sisters, Major Heyward, and the preacher are captured. Magua offers a deal to Cora, but it is refused. Then Hawkey and the Mohicans attack and rescue them. They all travel to Fort William Henry. Cora handles a musket, just in case. Colonel Munro knows their defense is weak. A British officer makes a visit to General Montcalm. There is a truce and a meeting. Montcalm asks for a surrender of the fort. His terms are accepted. But the Hurons get firewater at night! The British leave the fort, followed by women and children.

Magua incites the Hurons so they attack the refugees! Magua leads Cora and Alice away. Wounded soldiers are killed. A blazing torch is dropped into the powder magazine. Fires break out. Magua visits the camp of the peaceful Delaware tribe. So does Hawkeye and the Mohicans. The Delaware wise men give their decision. A compromise? Cora will go with Magua as a trade for Alice. Uncas will follow Magua after sunset. What will Cora do now? Uncas finds them and fights Magua hand to hand. There is no happy ending.

I've never read the novel but I can tell this is a very condensed version of it. It is a romance that takes place amidst historical events. The rivalry between Magua and Uncas over Cora is similar to the opera ""Carmen"" (which I've never seen). You probably need to read the book to best understand this movie. The scenes are interesting in portraying 18th century New York in the early 20th century. Those who are familiar with the geography can tell if this was filmed near Glens Falls. The town of Fort Edward is on Route 4 north of Saratoga Springs; Glens Falls is a few miles to the north. Before the 1920s the New York city area was the location of the American film industry.",1342396800,,2695,4.550515463917526
1328785,4,B00003ETJU,comparing this with the D D Lewis version is so very interesting.... esp. the falls jump which was only slightly alluded to in this film and greatly exaggerated with DDL... I assume this is more closely tied to the original literary concept and was surprised at the diverting plots... the love story which was only hinted at in that day was very touching and their demise in each others hands was truly sentimental and moving... I found the titles much more intelligent and educational compared to other silent films and actually thought this was a superior format to talkies as it gave more insight to characters and their motivations and I did not have to take notes on the machinations of the plot... very intersting experience for me who typically eschews the silent era... thank you for this wonderful expression of the text! high recommend,1337817600,,845,4.834482758620689
1328786,4,B00003ETJU,"In 1757 during the French and Indian War, the daughters (Barbara Bedford, Lillian Hall) of a Colonel (James Gordon) in the British army are traveling from Fort Edward to Fort William Henry to join their father when they are betrayed by their Indian guide (Wallace Beery). They are rescued by an Indian scout (Harry Lorraine) and his Mohican friend (Alan Roscoe) but their danger is far from over as the treacherous Magua (Beery) won't stop in either his desire for the lovely Bedford or the destruction of the British. Based on the James Fenimore Cooper novel, this is the second film version of the novel. The first was filmed in 1911 and would be filmed at least another three times after this film. Co-directed by Clarence Brown (NATIONAL VELVET) and Maurice Tourneur (the father of Jacques), it's a solid and absorbing condensation of the novel. However, unlike the other film versions, the character of Hawkeye is reduced to a minor role with the emphasis on the elder daughter and her ""romance"" with the Mohican chief's son (Roscoe). As such, it certainly can't be seen as a faithful version of the Fenimore Cooper novel but it's so good on its own terms that one would have to be churlish to complain. The Huron attack on the English is very well done and, for its day, quite brutal. One scene has an Indian grabbing an infant out of its mother's arms and tossing it away in the air!

1328787,5,B00003ETJU,"I had read about the 1922 version of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS in William K. Everson's excellent book AMERICAN SILENT FILM and CLASSICS OF THE SILENT SCREEN (Joe Franklin gets credit for this one, but Everson's was the one who did the research and most of the writing for that work). Directed by the great French director Maurice Tourneur and Clarence Brown (who later directed THE YEARLING) this is pictorially one of the most beautiful early films ever. The acting is very underplayed (especially for this early in film history) and the film follows James Fenimore Cooper's historical romance more closely then any of the films that have followed. It's one fault is that printed titles replace the showing of development scenes. The big shock was comparing it with the Daniel-Day Lewis version which  received an ""R"" rating. The indian violence in this film is actually much more disturbing then anything in the 1992 version. The print survives nicely except for the fact that the producers have removed the original opening titles and replaced them with some of their own in order to deter this print from being used by other DVD distributors. The scoring of the film is well done. Recommended to silent film fans and those who are interested in seeing a well done adventure film. If you've only seen the sound versions you are in for a shock as you see the climax of the 1922 rendering. ""A MASTERPIECE... Beautifully designed and lit... A rugged adventure tale, faithful to the spirit of the Fenimore Cooper original.""

1328789,5,B00003ETJU,"Although all-but rendered a trivia question these days because of Boris Karloff's appearance among Magua's exceptionally bloodthirsty Hurons, this 1920 silent adaptation is well worth a look.

Rather than Harry Lorraine's Hawkeye, for once the emphasis is on Uncas and Cora's doomed love affair, which is portrayed in a surprisingly non-judgemental fashion for its day. In a film filled with surprisingly restrained performances (even Wallace Beery doesn't go over the top as Magua) Barbara Bedford is so incredibly impressive that you wonder how it was that her career filtered out into uncredited bit parts and walk-ons, and the film is certainly worthy of her performance. Maurice Tourneur and future 30s A-list director Clarence Brown work wonders as co-directors: there's little camera movement, but some highly effective editing that keeps things moving along briskly while there's an interesting use of shifting light and shadows in some scenes. It's also surprisingly violent - the massacre scene is still shockingly brutal, with even babes in arms not immune from the vivid carnage.

The Slingshot DVD offers a pretty good print from the George Eastman House collection, with various tinted sequences restored to something like their original glory. Only the synthesizer score and new title cards are a bit of a letdown, but not enough to be a real problem.",1241654400,3,1366,5.319444444444445
1328790,3,B00003ETJU,The film is great to watch and recaptures the original effect seen by the 1920's audience. The musical score applied was crude and modern not matching the drama at any point. The title pages had also been recreated and lost their 1920's feel.,1231977600,3,242,4.651162790697675

1328804,5,B00003ETJU,The movie is an excellent depiction of James Fenimore Cooper's nove.  The filming is beautifully done and for the most part true to Cooper's story line.  Overall the movie follows the original book's plot better than any of the subsequent movie efforts including the 1990's version with Daniel Day Lewis as Hawkeye.  The only other filmed version more true to the book is the 1970's Masterpiece Theater production.  The filming of the massacre at Fort William Henry is a film masterpiece considering that it was produced in 1920.  The realism is frightening in its rendition.  Overall this is an excellent movie.,1215129600,7,612,5.00990099009901

1328807,5,B00003ETJU,"I couldn't believe it when I first saw this film. Uncas, the American Indian - not Hawkeye - is the protagonist?! The white love interest is attracted to him?! And this was made in 1920?!! (However, it seems that depiction of inter-racial couples were more likely in silent films which predated the 1930 introduction of the Hayes Code that ruled the next few decades and included anti-miscegenation rules.)

[edit July 2010]
I finally read a synopsis of Cooper's novel and was surprised to find out that the pairing of Cora and Uncas came directly from the book. It was perhaps made palatable by Cora being a quarter Black (which I don't recall being  mentioned in the movie).
[end edit]

Of course, the Indian is played by very white-looking Albert Roscoe. But, it's the thought that counts. Especially when that thought is expressed by pretty, goth-looking (with her shadowed eyes and wild hair) Barbara Bedford. She was about 17-years-old at the time, but she gives a beautifully understated performance, altho her intense eyes convey plenty.

It took me a while to recognize the actor playing Magua, the bad Indian. It was Wallace Beery, looking more like an African warrior. He's a terrific bad guy, tho.

One of early cinema's innovators, Tourneur (and fill-in director Clarence Brown) make frequent use of vignetting (frames), silhouettes, long shots, and daring lighting (such as the flickering lighting of a fireplace). So, this is a visual treat. Even the tinting in this film is effective.

It's a 1 hr 12 minute movie, so expect most of the novel to be glossed over. But the action scenes are engaging. Well...the Indian massacre of the surrendering British soldiers and civilians leaving Ft William Henry (a historical fact) went on a little long (in dramatic terms for this short movie).

It's a silent film, so many people won't be interested. While it's not dramatically nor technically perfect, if you're American Indian, like me, and/or you like new movie experiences, you might find this a fascinating curiosity.",1183766400,2,2031,5.008902077151335
1328808,4,B00003ETJU,"James Fenimore Cooper's 1826 classic novel, LAST OF THE MOHICANS is a pure example of historical romanticism.  Directors Maurice Tourneur and Clarence Brown brings the classic American novel alive with this 1920 silent film adaptation.  With great vividness and photographic craftsmanship, viewers have the opportunity to see Hollywood's take on the French and Indian War.

Within the same lines as D.W. Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION and other early American film classics that depict America's historical past, LAST OF THE MOHICANS reflects and laments on a time that has long gone by.  For those who have studied or read American history, Hollywood films tend to posses inaccuracies and misinterpretations of historical events in order to recapture or glorify a period for the present day moviegoer.  In spite of the filmmakers staying loyal to Cooper's narrative, sadly, they depict and magnify the savage aspects about Native Americans and only show a small inkling of the alliances made between colonists and indians within their dying civilization.  In addition, one sees the subtle romance between White woman, Cora Munro (Barbara Bedford) and Mohican Indian, Uncas (Alan Roscoe) that is dramatically shown throughout the film.

The most impressive part about the film is its cinematography and restoration and preservation done by the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House.  The distinct color tints, depth of field of the landscape, and the period costumes are exceptional minus the pale over-powdered faces of the actors.  Tourneur and Brown shot the picturesque mountainous scenes in California's backcountry - Big Bear Lake, San Bernadino County National Forest and the legendary Yosemite National Park - absolutely breathtaking scenes that are captured during the conclusion of the film where antagonist, Magua (Wallace Beery), stands atop a cliff viewing the vast untouched landscape.

If there existed a list of top films with a historical slant, LAST OF THE MOHICANS would be on the list.  The film is a pure example of imaginative film-making as well as how history is depicted through the Hollywood perspective.",1171584000,2,2150,5.407185628742515
1328809,5,B00003ETJU,"Having recently revisited this title as part of the available films of Maurice Tourneur on commercial DVD (the others are ALIAS JIMMY VALENTINE, THE BLUE BIRD, A GIRL'S FOLLY, LORNA DOONE, VICTORY, and THE WISHING RING), I am again reminded of what a remarkable director he was and what a remarkable achievement this film is. Of all the existing versions this one is by far and away the most faithful to the James Fennimore Cooper original (the Daniel Day-Lewis version strays the farthest).

The film was beautifully photographed on mostly natural locations (Yosemite Valley) and features fine understated performances from all the principal players especially Barbara Bedford as Cora (Boris Karloff is briefly seen as an Indian who throws a baby up in the air). The film is co-credited to Tourneur and Clarence Brown (Garbo's favorite director and maker of THE YEARLING). Tourneur was injured during the filming and Brown shot most of it. In a magnanimous gesture Tourneur wanted Brown to receive full credit but Brown refused saying that he only followed what Tourneur had already laid out and that he learned his craft from him.

The print used here is from the George Eastman House and it is beautiful with subtle tints and proper framing. The title cards are new as is the electronic music score. While the score is perfectly suitable it really needs a chamber ensemble or small orchestra to fully bring it to life but this is a small quibble. The DVD is officially out-of-print but is worth tracking down as one of the very best silent examples of transferring a classic book to the screen. That comes as no surprise for if you check Tourneur's available titles, all but one are taken from literary sources.",1155081600,16,1714,4.88659793814433
1328810,4,B00003ETJU,"This review is not speaking to the historical and writer's inaccuracies about the Mohican People, but is speaking to the added music score.  A new edition of this film is available now with an entirely new film music score. The film itself has been remastered from a french nitrate master, by George Eastman House. The Slingshot and Miramax releases added a rather poor film score, with flute and synthesizer. A new version exists now, however, with an entirely new film score by a Mohican Composer, ""The 1920 Classic Myth: The Last of the Mohicans"" (2003) in 5.1 surround sound, re-scored for full orchestra, and American Indian instruments.

1328811,5,B00003ETJU,"I have to honestly say that I did not even know there was a silent version of this film.  I actually ordered it because I like the story and thought it would be interesting to see a silent version.  Viewing this version was- breathtaking to say the least.  The video transfer of this film is remarkably good which helps but more importantly the story itself and the acting I found incredibly interesting.  Unlike the Dnaiel Day-Lewis version, which is excellent in its own right- this version has Hawkeye as a Minor Character.  It focuses on the affection between Uncus (one of the 2 last of the Mohicans) and the General's Dauhter Cora (played by Madeline Stowe in the modern version).  It must have been somewhat unsettling back in 1920 to even hint at a relationship between a Native American man and a Caucasian woman.  This movie only hints at this relationship but I found it to be very believable and a refreshing point of view  tastefully done. Another major plus of this movie was the actress who played Cora. If you view this movie it will be difficult to not think about this woman.  I've seldom seen an actress or an actor emote so much simply by facial expression.  Wallace Beery portrays Magua, the ""bad"" guy, menacingly well and, early in the film, you can see a very young Boris Karloff as an Indian raider.  If you enjoy the story of Last of the Mohicans and if you have had the pleasure of seeing any silent film masterpiece you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD.",1060473600,13,1478,4.5606060606060606

Atmosphere is so important when watching a silent film -- you have to be totally immersed in all the aspects that constitute the whole. Having a totally inappropriate and monotonous synth score and sub titles that have no charm whatsoever,kept jarring me back to the present and as a result I could not appreciate the film as it deserved to be. A solo piano would have been preferable if a cost was a consideration and there is no excuse for not using, or at least reproducing, the original titles.",1004400000,,689,4.564516129032258
1328813,5,B00003ETJU,"Last of the Mohicans is a very fine silent adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's Classic novel. The film distils a long novel into its fairly short running time, but remains faithful to the essence of Cooper's story. The main change is that the role of Hawkeye is relegated to one of secondary importance. The emphasis of the film is on the romance between Uncas and Cora Munro and the scheming of the evil Magua to have Cora for himself.
The performances in the film are naturalistic and full of feeling. Wallace Beery as Magua makes a fine villain, while Barbara Bedford is a stunning Cora, brave, beautiful and feisty. But what makes this film work so well is the use of location, the glorious scenery and the thrilling action. Some of this action is surprisingly violent, especially an attack by drunken Hurons on a group of refugees. This attack includes a shocking scene of an infant torn from her mother's arms and thrown skyward to its death. Although the Hurons are shown in a poor light, the film on the whole, as is the case with Cooper's novel, is sympathetic towards the Native American characters. Uncas is portrayed as a far superior man to Cora's original British suitor. Her being attracted to Uncas is shown to be natural and indeed commonplace. This must have seemed a daring approach for a film made in 1920, a time when interracial romance was considered taboo.
This is a very well produced DVD. The print quality is first class with almost no apparent damage.  The colour-tinted images are sharp and clear and some of the scenes are dazzling in their beauty.
