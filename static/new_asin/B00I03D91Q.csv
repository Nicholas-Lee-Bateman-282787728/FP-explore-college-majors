The single star was required to give this review, but this is no one star. it's a negative -*",1396656000,7,245,4.020408163265306
6244746,5,B00I03D91Q,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!!!!! Perfect to give your kids ;) I was pleasently surprised... The other reveiws were so harsh but I am glad I made up my own mind. This is a timeless movie perfect for all ages. My kids watched it with there grandparents and they were both laughing. Very cute movie,1396224000,11,286,4.415094339622642
6244747,4,B00I03D91Q,"This is a great movie that your kids will enjoywill laugh a lot atbut will make the adults groan. This is not the Little Rascals you grew up with, sort of.

Viewing this movie with the fondness of the past will cause pain; the anachronisms are too much to handle. In the same scene an ice cream man delivers a treat to school, a kid dances to music from his iPod. In another scene, we see an old time theatre, soda jerk shop, and bakery, but then a hummer pulls up. I get they wanted to show the new and the old, but it wasn't the same ol' Rascals.

The other issue I had was the over-acting. Aside from the venerable Doris Roberts, most of the adult actors did not correspond well with the children actors. It just seemed off.

That said, my kids enjoyed this movie. Adults falling, cakes blowing up, pets being turned different colors, cars rolling down hills: everything kids love to laugh at. In the end, isn't that what counts?

Im giving this four stars, not because of my own enjoyment, but because I believe every kid (whom this movie is meant for) will have a great time watching it.",1396224000,12,1092,4.338235294117647

6244749,1,B00I03D91Q,"Generally as a rule, I don't go below 3 stars on a bad kids movie unless it is a real stinker. I didn't like the last Little Rascals movie, and as bad as that one was as compared to the original, this one is worse than that one.

The characters were reproduced horribly down to Alfalfa's fake cow lick. It is as if they attempted to parody the original. This film combines several of the original episodes into one as the gang tries to raise money to save grandma's bakery. I couldn't help but cringe at the climax as ""The International Silver String Submarine Band"" performed Sonny and Cher as opposed to the wonderful original where all the gang members sang ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze."" If this was a play, Spanky would have been booed off stage.

If they couldn't make a film better than this, they should not have even tried. It was a pathetic attempt.",1395446400,4,861,4.408805031446541

Humor was almost all slapstick kind, like the cop who gets dragged spread eagle into a pole.  The big downfall for me was the writing.  I like movies where children act like children, and not like small versions of adults.  But that is very subjective and for those who like this movie, great for you.  It just did not work very well for me.

Acting was just average in most cases with some of the adult actors just marginal.

For me, I give this movie a C.",1424304000,,640,4.180327868852459
6244790,1,B00I03D91Q,"Very young kids will get a laugh out of this mindless slapstick but for anyone else this one is just painful.

6244791,5,B00I03D91Q,My daughter loves this movie. She received it as a stocking stuffer this Christmas.,1423180800,,83,5.0
6244792,5,B00I03D91Q,"If you grew up on the original Our Gang/Little Rascals like I did, your first thoughts might be ""this is going to be awful"". It isn't, at least not for the kids. I was surprised at how clean the humour was, how there were imaginative gags from the original Hal Roach shorts, instead of the gross-humour garbage we see on TV these days.
I first learned of this movie through Rio Mangini's (""Woim"") acting teacher, who also trains my daughter. The movie came out quietly in 2014 and while it was done on the cheap, it's fairly nostalgic and sentimental toward the original. A number of situations come directly from those B&W shorts, most noticeably ""Birthday Blues"" (with the weep-wow cake gag taken to absurd exaggeration here), ""Helping Grandma"", and ""Came the Brawn"" (the Masked Marvel wrestling match). It even paid homage to the MGM era, with the ""Let's put on a show"" idea. Here, the song chosen is not of the time period for the original Rascals, but these aren't the original Rascals. We could assume them to be descendents of the originals, as we see glimpses of adult versions in one scene.
Perhaps the most puzzling change was Mary Ann Jackson (played here by Jenna Ortega, adorable). The original was the 20's-30's version of a tomboy, but due to that era's sensibilities she mostly wore dresses. In this version she's gone full overalls. It's a type that makes sense for today's audiences, and my daughter, who loves the original Mary Ann, didn't mind at all. She was more aware that Pete the Pup didn't look quite like he should, but it didn't bother me.
Mary Ann Jackson was not a part of the Alfalfa/Darla era. In the 1994 Little Rascals she was included, and they even used an actress who heavily resembled her, but they didn't give her much to do. Here Mary Ann is definitely a part of Our Gang and my daughter's favourite character.
Now, if you are a fan of the 1994 movie and not necessarily of the original Little Rascals, you might be disappointed here. The humour is cleaner, the pacing less hectic, and the entire thing was shot on the Universal backlot. You can even see the Hill Valley clock tower from Back to the Future. The scenes involving the town square are like a trip back to ""Back to the Future"".  Drew Justice is very good but he's no Bug Hall (although Bug makes a cameo as the ice cream cake delivery man). One of the reasons there has never been a de facto successor to the Little Rascals series is the absence of ""natural"" talent in Hollywood children. By that I mean, the way the originals interacted was the way children interact normally, not acting precocious or imitating adult actors or thinking they're in the Disney Channel. That natural quality is almost entirely absent from child actors today.
My family hopes for sequels (and my daughter, who watches this every day, looks for casting notices for one) but given that the movie went straight to DVD and isn't very well publicised, it's likely we'll have to wait another 20 years for the next attempt at a Little Rascals movie. Maybe by then my daughter will audition for Miss Crabtree. ;-)",1421193600,4,3089,4.626593806921676

6244836,3,B00I03D91Q,"I was looking forward to this movie.  I'm a fan of the original Our Gang comedies, as well as the 1994 movie directed by Penelope Spheeris who got the casting of the kids about as right as you could want & managed to coax very good performances out of the kids, closely mimicking the personalities of their counterparts from the original shorts.  I'm sure kids will love this new movie just fine.  Mine did, but for me it was a disappointment.  The director was clearly more focused on getting the best performances out of the kids, less concerned about story & editing & I couldn't help but feel embarrased for the adults in this film.  This movie is 100% made for kids and makes no bones about it so I cant' really be too critical.  I was hoping this movie would be as good or better than previous one.  Look for a cameo by actor Bug Hall who played Alfalfa in the '94 movie - he plays the ice cream delivery guy in this one.",1397433600,3,927,4.2628571428571425
6244837,1,B00I03D91Q,I trusted the other reviews and thought it was going to be fantastic but it wasn't.  The kids are cute but the movie isn't worth the money. I should have rented it.,1397260800,3,164,4.125
6244838,1,B00I03D91Q,"My 10 year old is a huge fan of the 90's version so we rented this one.  Ugh. We couldn't finish it.  I know that the actors are kids and that this is a straight to DVD release, but still, the acting was horrible and the story line was even worse. I get that it's a kid movie and that kid movies are notoriously bad but when even my kids lost interest 20 minutes in,  that says something.",1396742400,4,388,3.948717948717949
6244839,5,B00I03D91Q,"I just rented this and the original ""Little Rascals"" on demand last night even though I already own the first movie on DVD. I only rented both movies mainly for ""The Little Rascals Save the Day"" and the only way I could rent it on demand through my cable TV was to rent the double feature which contained both LR movies and I did not want to rent it with Amazon video on demand and watch it on my computer moniter. So I think I got me pretty good deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith

Update for 11/9/2014 I just bought this DVD as an upcoming birthday gift for my sister who is a die hard ""Little Rascals"" fan. I know that she will really enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1396656000,,662,4.338709677419355
