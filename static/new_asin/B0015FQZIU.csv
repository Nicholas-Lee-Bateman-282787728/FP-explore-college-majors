3144734,3,B0015FQZIU,"I purchased this set at Big Lots for $6.00, but wish now that I had bought it here.
Big Fat Liar features two of the most fun actors in Hollywood (Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes), who were both likely young teenagers in this movie.  Having the two popular young actors makes for one really fun movie.  Thunderbirds seems a bit lame at first, but starts to grow on you.  The scenes are bright and colorful, and make for an enjoyable, adventurous family film.  Vanessa Hudgens is cute and interesting.
Johnny English can be either funny or tastelessly bad, depending on your personal taste in comedy (it's definitely not a film for the kids).  I thought it was crap.
Rocky and Bullwinkle is interesting to a point, though it is not a really great movie.  It has a tendency to drag at times.  But for what you will pay on Amazon at its lowest price, the set is worth some good weekend fun.  Get some friends to9gether, have a party and enjoy yourself!",1286064000,2,948,4.47093023255814
3144735,3,B0015FQZIU,"I love all of these movies, and having a set of dvds with four movies is a good idea, but they really should've had the movie been related in some way. Like four movies in a series or movie with the same actor or actors. That aside, this set is great. And it IS the only way to get Big Fat Liar in it's proper widescreen picture. True, you don't get all the same extras as on the single disc releases, but these aren't really the kind of movies that cry out for extensive documentaries or commentaries.",1276041600,2,502,4.185567010309279
3144736,3,B0015FQZIU,"""Big Fat Liar"", ""Johnny English"", ""Thunderbirds"", and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" make a nice family pack of entertainment.

Big Fat Liar is about a fourteen year old that gets into trouble for lying quite often. When he decides to clean up his act he writes an English paper about a big fat liar to pass his class. When a movie producer steals it, he follows him to Los Angeles to get it back. A fairly funny movie with Malcom in the Middle star, Frankie Muniz. Individual price $8.49. Three star movie.

Johnny English has the always amusing Rowan Atkinson as a spy for Britain. More of a bumbling basket case like ""Get Smarts"" Don Adams, the movie has quite a few laughs. Individual price $9.99. Three star movie.

Thunderbirds is based on the puppet series and does a nice transition to live action. Good cast and decent effects make this action movie well worth catching. Individual price $17.99. Three star movie.

Rocky and Bullwinkle is based on the cartoon series and once again becomes a good live action movie. If you enjoy the cartoons and like the ""Adams Family"" movie you will probably enjoy this one. Individual price $9.99. Two star movie.

This pack is very reasonably priced at $4.25 approximately each, and it has movies the whole family will enjoy. The movies are rated for most ages and are not derogatory. I recommend this set of good quality DVDs with good replayability. - C. Luster",1208822400,7,1401,4.702040816326531

8258330,5,B0015FQZIU,Thanks!,1476835200,,7,7.0
8258331,4,B0015FQZIU,"Rocky and Bullwinkle, Johnny English,  Thunderbirds 2004, four film favorites.... three really good movies .... so much better than the absolute junk that's been coming out of Hollywood in the last 10, 15, 20 years.  recent movies are so visually dark and ugly dirty dingy looking and noisy... they are lacking color, almost mono tone.... add to that the lack of acting due to the reliance upon special-effects computer graphics fistfights and gunfights.... there's more automatic weapon fire than dialogue in a lot of movies... mindless drivel... not to mention all the foul (idiotic) language in today's movies.

However these (3 of 4) movies are refreshing reminder of what the theater used to be like ... it used to be enjoyable to go to the cinema and relax and watch a movie.... not so today.  so i'm really glad to find these 4 movies (big fat liar is OK I wouldn't say it's good, but it's Okay compared to movies being made today) whereas the the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie is excellent... having grown up watching this cartoon series with its intelligent dialogue... it refreshing, well done and creative.... very nice to see the combination of the cartoon characters with the real world characters and the way it was handled.  I read lots of reviews criticizing the acting etc. etc... this is not a serious movie,  it's not supposed to be Academy award acting performance, this is Rocky and Bullwinkle !

The Thunderbirds movie, 2004 I think is also excellent, having grown up watching the Thunderbirds.  this version is a nice extension of the Thunderbird story in a modern context, the cinematography is colorful and pleasant to watch.... the story is fun interesting intelligent. The Mr. Bean Johnny English movie is excellent.

so three movies which I would give five stars each because they are enjoyable, fun, well done, intelligent.... I don't like the big famous Academy award-winning movies with the big famous movie stars.... thery are all so serious and think they're so important... what is an Academy award anyway except the motion picture Academy giving awards to itself.... hype...

these movies (3 out of 4)are a refreshing taste different set of what the cinema used to be like before it got too heavy, dark, and obscene....

 not to mention the super cheap price ... these are all good quality movies, good sound , good image, a nice DVD set.",1441324800,,2370,4.882793017456359
