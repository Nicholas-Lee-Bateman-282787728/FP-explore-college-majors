1586717,5,B00005JPII,"This show is two things for certain:
1. On the outside, it's a funny, clever, sometimes even witty comedy drama about an out of place latino girl and her adventures in the sophisticated New York fashion scene.  Think ""The Devil Wars Prada"" the TV show, only with a girl who decides not to change to fit in with the crowd.

2. This show tackles a lot of things currently going on in todays society.  There are several gay characters, including possibly Betty's young nephew.  There are some lesbians, though not terribly often.  There are transsexuals, including Betty's boses thought to be dead brother who is now his sister.  There are topics and discussions about illegal immigrants and the impact of such things on people's lives, etc, etc.

All in all it's probably one of the best shows on television.",1183766400,6,806,4.755395683453237
1586718,5,B00005JPII,"In retrospect, the 2006-2007 television season debuted an unusually large number of first rate new series:  HEROES, MEN IN TREES, 30 ROCK, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, DEXTER, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and UGLY BETTY.  That is a remarkably strong group of new shows.  UGLY BETTY occupied a unique niche among them.  The new show it most resembled was MEN IN TREES.  Both were light fare, intended to entertain and charm rather than challenge and rattle.  It was unorthodox, but in comforting ways.  It was, basically, a very nice show.  One never came away from any episode shocked or dismayed as with the best episodes of DEXTER or FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but to tell the truth, after a week of watching my favorite shows on TV--BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, LOST, DEXTER, and others that were sometimes exceedingly emotional affairs to watch, I found it a refreshing change of pace, never shocking, never emotionally taxing, never intellectually demanding.  It managed always to be smart while also very easy to absorb.  Most of all, it was great fun.

The plot was simple.  Betty Suarez desires a job in publishing.  After she applies at MODE magazine, where she has a disastrous interview, she finds herself mysterious hired as assistant to editor Daniel Meade, playboy son of Meade Publishing owner Bradford Meade.  It turns out that Bradford had seen her leaving the building and ordered her hired for his son simply because she is as far from a fashion model in appearance as can be imagined.  She has terrible hair, dresses horridly, has garish braces, thick glasses (and eyebrows), and carries more weight than your standard attractive woman.  Father makes her employment mandatory for his rare-do-well son.  Very quickly, however, she proves herself not merely necessary for Daniel's professional life, but a good friend as well.  One of the most attractive aspects of the show is, in fact, their genuinely caring, completely platonic, friendship.  Working at MODE pulls Betty into a world of interoffice intrigue and political infighting.  To be honest, I could have lived without any of the stories.  The appeal was just about 100% based on a large number of likable and adorable characters popping up each week.

America Ferrera, who had previously been amazingly effective in the cult-hit film REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES and the teen chick flick THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS (a sequel to the latter is due in 2008), simply steals this show as Betty.  Though not a slender actress, America in fact has a beautiful face.  They do a great make up job on her, however, putting a terrible wig on her each week (with very stressed looking hair), gluing thick, fake eyebrows on her, giving her thick-framed, brightly colored glasses, fake braces, make up to give her an unpleasant complexion, and an incredibly unflattering set of clothes.  Despite this dramatic transformation each week, Betty manages to be utterly charming and adorable.  A couple of people I've talked to feel it is a bit of a cheat to have an attractive woman play someone who is supposed to be ""ugly,"" but I think it would be a bit cruel to take an unattractive person and have them play such a role.  I would be surprised if she does not get an Emmy nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy.  Lauren Graham deserves to win in this category (as she does every year) for her genius work in THE GILMORE GIRLS, but since the Emmys year after year have ignored Graham (her show is on the wrong network), I will probably be pulling for America to win.

Ferrera is supported by an amazingly strong cast.  Eric Mabius is wonderful as Daniel, consistently showing himself to be a decent guy despite his efforts to transform himself into a waste of humanity.  I think there is a secret contract someone dictating that Alan Dale appear in every other show on TV in some capacity or other.  He is his usual stern self as Bradford Meade (he also has a very occasional but ongoing role in LOST, the only show I've seen him on where he gets to use something like is native Kiwi accent).  Vanessa Williams is a lot of fun as the scheming and unscrupulous Wilhelmina Slater, the fashion editor at MODE who would love to be the editor in chief.  Ashley Jensen, who really is Scottish, plays the head of wardrobe at MODE and one of Betty's few friends at the magazine.  But the people at MODE who make the show worth watching are Michael Urie and Becki Newton, who play Marc and Amanda, Wilhelmina's gay assistant and the mildly sluttish receptionist, both of them for most of the season Betty's mortal enemies (though by end of season she was making headway with both of them as friends, in particular Marc, inspiring him to come out to his mother).  There is also Henry, winningly played by Christopher Gorham.  He had previously played the title role in JAKE 2.0, on which UGLY BETTY executive producer Silvio Horta also worked.  I suspect his appearing on UGLY BETTY has something to do with that connection.  Gorham is a very good-looking guy who is somehow able to pull off completely nerdy guys, in this show an accountant.

But there is more than just the office.  There is Betty's home life.  Veteran character actor Tony Plana plays Betty's illegal immigrant father (one of the subplots deals with his attempt to get a green card).  He is one of these actors who has appeared in literally hundreds of TV shows and movies, but has rarely had an especially prominent role.  You love to see fine actors who have paid their dues get a great role like this one.  Ana Ortiz is hysterical as Betty's garish sister Hilda, but the person who steals nearly every scene in the Suarez household is twelve-year old Mark Indelicato, who plays Betty's nephew Justin.  We don't know that Justin is gay, but his effeminate swagger, his deep love of stage musicals, and his encyclopedic knowledge of fashion marks him with all of the stereotypes.

This show is too smart to be a guilty pleasure, but it is just as much fun as one.  It doesn't go on my list of my absolute favorite shows.  It isn't as sophisticated or as intelligent as FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, as engrossing as LOST, a fist-in-the-gut like DEXTER or THE WIRE, or as original or jaw-droppingly brilliant as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, but sometimes you just aren't in the mood for something as heavy as these shows.  Sometimes you just want to have a good time and relax.  I promise there are few shows on television more perfect for that than this.",1179360000,88,6439,4.745503597122302

1587261,5,B00005JPII,"While the cast is extremely talented, the acting amazing, the dialog witty, and the sets and wardrobe ""to die for"", what makes Ugly Betty really special, is the program's outstanding writing, and unique narrative style.  The stories are interesting, funny, poignant, and have a singular ability to touch your emotions, and make you reflect about what is important in life.  Throughout the season, the series' creative team, skillfully incorporates a number of long story arcs, some of which dramatically culminate in the season's final episode.  Spoilers will follow, so stop here if you have not watched Season One.

America Ferrera plays Betty Suarez, a recent college graduate, who because of her less than glamorous appearance, gets a job at Mode Magazine, a fashion publication, as the executive assistant to the newly appointed editor, Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius).  Aware that his son Daniel has a habit of sleeping with his female coworkers and models, publisher Bradford Meade (Alan Dale) is the reason why Betty, who wears glasses and metal braces, was hired.

Betty doesn't quite fit in at Mode, but her dedication to her job, and loyalty to Daniel, prove invaluable, as there are some who would like to see Daniel fail.  Over the course of the season, there are a number of plots to discredit Daniel, or remove him as editor.

Quirky, unique, and with a heart of gold, Betty is also tough, and able to adapt to difficult situations.  Her professional life is balanced by her family, as she lives in Queens with her father Ignacio (Tony Plana), older sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz), and her nephew Justin (Mark Indelicato).  Family members figure prominently in the drama, as crossover between work and home, soon becomes quite common.

A drama/comedy, the program is like a soap opera, concurrently developing a number of ongoing storylines, which unfold over a series of episodes.  The pot is always bubbling, with new flavors being added in.  With colorful characters, outrageous behavior, intriguing angles, devious schemes, and surprising twists, Ugly Betty is always an engaging watch.  While some of the characters might seem superficial or shallow, when the focus zooms in on them, there is usually something there that makes them sympathetic, or at least interesting.

There is an inherent contrast between the glittery world of Mode, and the struggling to get by reality of Betty's life at home.  Each world is special in its own way, and holds lessons to be learned.  In navigating through them, Ugly Betty features many special relationships between the various characters, tapping into the emotions in some very unique ways, and making some poignant statements about values.

The fabulous regular and guest cast also includes Vanessa Williams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraser/dp/B001CT877Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraser</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanessa-Williams-Greatest-Hits/dp/B00000DLYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanessa Williams Greatest Hits)</a>, Rebecca Romijn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Femme-Fatale/dp/B0000897EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Femme Fatale</a>), Becki Newton, Michael Urie, Judith Light(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-The-Boss/dp/B0001Z3I1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's The Boss?</a>), Ashley Jensen, Kevin Sussman (The Big Bang Theory), Christopher Gorham, Gina Gershon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showgirls/dp/B004TJ1GVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showgirls</a>), Jayma Mayes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Blart-Mall-Cop/dp/B001VLFE6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Blart Mall Cop</a>), Lucy Liu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-1-and-2/dp/B007JNWQZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill 1 and 2)</a>, and co-executive producer Salma Hayek.

1587468,4,B00005JPII,"""Ugly Betty"" had a lot of elements that made for a great series.  At times, it was hilarious, touching, and insightful and I think the cast was just great.

The only flaw to me was the whole character of Alex Meade/Alexis Meade.  I know I risk people calling me a bigot but I think people who get sex change operations are very strange and unnerving.  I say this knowing that some people really are born with the wrong sex and need to get that changed.  I have no problems with them doing that if they and their doctors feel it is appropriate.  I think they should be left alone (for example:  I thought the way that some jerk pretended to like Alexis in a bar only so he could humiliate Alexis was a hateful and cruel way to behave).  But with all that being said, I'm not interested in watching how such a person goes about their life...even if it's in a comedy.

Fortunately, one can fast forward past stuff like that.

Also, I think it was a mistake to cast Rebecca Romjin in the role of Alexis.  I think it would have been a bit more believable if a somewhat plainer actress (or maybe a male actor) had been picked up for that role.",1304985600,,1137,4.241860465116279

She is constantly told that in order to fit in with the world she works in, she must change to be and look just like them, but through each episode you notice that she is the one who has the positive affect on those around her and changes them for the better instead.  I love the special features that come with this box set too.

1587638,4,B00005JPII,"When this show first came out, I had as much interest in it as I do in fashion.  Zip.  I can't stand the whole industry, so why would I want to watch a show that takes place in the one place that I can't stand?  Well, boredom got the best of me and I rented season 1 from the library.  Half a day later, I was completely done with the season and was frantically searching the library catalog for season 2.  Finally I had to just go out and buy the second season.

This show is addicting.  Even though it bugs me to no end that they think that just adding braces, glasses, making her hair stand out a foot from her head, and making her dress in awful clothes (for me to say that...it's bad) will suddenly make America Ferrera ""ugly"".  When she is surrounded by all the beautiful models and handsome men that have natural fashion sense, you can see that she's the ugly duckling.  The whole time you're rooting for her...like you should be.

The first two seasons were amazing.  There are all these little subplots while Betty is running around, saving the day.  People are plotting to take over Mode magazine, blackmailing is going on, dead people come back to life...etc. (sounds just like a cheesy soap, but this is so much better) But, by the time season 3 started, the show lost some of its flair.

When season 4 started, I decided that it should't be called Ugly Betty anymore because they aren't even trying to make her look like the ugly duckling anymore.  She dresses in completely awesome work clothes that look normal, no more braces, she lost weight...it's just not the same Betty.  Granted, you really only have braces for so long and they were bound to come off sooner or later, but all the other stuff on top of it?  She looks more like someone who belongs at Mode and that's why I liked the show in the first place...because it was obvious that she was in a place where people thought she didn't belong.  She was going for what she believed in...but not so much anymore.

Don't get me wrong, I still watch the show every week, but I love the first and second seasons the most.  If you want to see the show, at least see just those two seasons.",1260144000,,2156,4.345

1587705,5,B00005JPII,"A one of a kind series, Ugly Betty, brings to the screen the parallel stories of those found within a New York City based women's fashion magazine's microcosmos.
America Ferrera, Eric Mabius, Salma Hayek, Rebecca Romijn, Vanessa Williams, Michael Urie, Becki Newton, Tony Plana, Ana Ortiz, Mark Indelicato, Ashley Jensen, Christopher Gorham, Judith Light, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears. The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it is actually a bit of both. Ugly Betty does a great job of describing people's different personalities, fears, and the problems they face. It is all about human relations, hope, and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
There are, however, two (relatively minor) points worth noting:
1) There is an ongoing adult theme (homosexuality) throughout the series not suited for children.
2) Amazon's Jae-Ha Kim whose review for no apparent reason speculates as to the sexuality of one of the actors; the young teenage actor Mark Indelicato! Leave the kid alone!
Nevertheless, that is all insignificant compared to the acting, the setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues, and the music, which are just wonderful! It is indeed a rarity when an amazing series such as this comes by.
In short, Ugly Betty is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1219622400,,1849,5.082236842105263

1587707,5,B00005JPII,"I am not a big television person, which is why I did not watch the first season of Ugly Betty while it aired.  I've had the DVD box set for ages, but didn't watch it until recently.  I watched the original telenovela this show is based on (Betty la Fea), and I wondered if the American version would do it justice.  Ugly Betty, like its Colombian counterpart, has proven that a soap opera-ish TV series could be over the top and entertaining and still be well written and clever.

Betty Suarez is a Mexican-American from Queens is fresh out of college, hoping to land a job in magazine publishing.  First impressions are not in her favor.  She is not an attractive girl (to say the least), but she's got intelligence, wit and an exuberant personality on her side.  Unfortunately, Meade Publications' most successful magazine, Mode, is not interested in the aforementioned qualities.  It is, after all, a fashion magazine.  So imagine Betty's surprise when she does get hired.  But she gets hired for the wrong reasons.  Bradford Meade (Alan Dale) hires Betty to be his womanizing son Daniel's assistant (Eric Mabius) to keep him concentrating on his work and not on getting into a beautiful secretary's skirt.  Upset, Daniel tries to get Betty to quit, but quickly warms up to her sweet disposition.  She is the brains and strength behind most of his decisions regarding both his job and personal life, so she soon becomes something of a lifeline for him.  Things aren't easy for Betty at Mode.  Marc (Michael Urie) and Amanda (Becki Newton), an assistant to the creative director and the receptionist respectively, decide to make Betty's life hell by constantly mocking her.  Everyone else seems to find her amusing.  She does have friends though.  Christina (Ashley Jensen), the magazine's Scottish wardrobe person and Henry (Christopher Gorham), the hot geeky accountant, are always there with and for her.  Throw in lots and lots of office politics, a mysterious woman about to make a comeback, an ambitious creative director who will do anything to become Mode's editor-in-chief (Vanessa Williams), murder, intrigue, and immigration issues, and you have yourself one entertaining show.

First let me give props to America Ferrera.  She is absolutely adorable as Betty.  Though not classically beautiful, America is a very attractive young woman, and it must not be easy to be shown in the most unflattering light week after week.  She pulls it off with aplomb though, and the actress succeeds in endearing the character to the audience with her sweetness and cheerfulness.  The show is about an ugly girl working in one of the most superficial industries around, but this one girl manages to bring out depth in the shallowest character.  Yes, even Willemina (Williams), Marc and Amanda surprise you every now and then.  Rebecca Romjin is surprisingly great as ""Alexis."" She can be ruthless and petty one minute and vulnerable and complex the next.  I probably would have picked a better-looking actor to play Daniel, but Mabius is doing a wonderful job.  At times, it seems like he's only using Betty, but he truly cares for his underling and sees her more like a friend and confidante than just an assistant.  Marc and Amanda remind me of Jack and Karen from Will & Grace, which is fine with me, for I used to love that show.  And who can forget the Latin talent on this show?  I love Betty's supportive dad Ignacio (Tony Plana), her loud and tacky sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz) and her fashion-savvy, Broadway enthusiast nephew Justin (Mark Indelicato), who is so going to be gay when he grows up.  (I crack up when the family watches what is so obvious to me parodies of a Mexican soap opera.)  Put all of that together with guest stars like Salma Hayek (also one of the show's executive producers) and Lucy Lu and you've got a winner.  There is comedy, intrigue, romance and poignant moments.  I absolutely loved the season finale.  So many cliffhangers and sad moments.  I am so rooting for Betty and Henry.  He'd better be back next season.  I can't wait to pick up season two.  After that, I will definitely be watching season three every week.

* I haven't had the opportunity to check out the DVD extras, but I look forward to watching the interviews and listening to the commentary. *",1218067200,,4294,4.811475409836065
1587708,5,B00005JPII,"Ugly Betty, Season 1, is a fantastic TV show. It's different from a lot of shows that one can view on television. The main character, Betty, is unique and lovable. It's hard not to like her. All of the other characters are great as well, especially Wilhelmina Slater, who is the villain of the show.
The special features contained in these DVDs are excellent; there are several featurettes as well as audio commentary on several episodes by the cast and crew. My favorite special feature is the audio commentary; it is great because you get all of this behind-the-scenes insight that you can never get by simply watching the episodes alone.",1214524800,3,640,4.774774774774775

1587710,5,B00005JPII,"with a great message underneath all the backstabbing, lying, egotistical models, plotting, and everything else that makes Ugly Betty a truly great show.  It also lets people know that it is okay to be who you are and that you don't have to conform to everyone else's opinions or thoughts on you.

The First Season of the show runs the gamut from evil, vindictive and power hungry creative directors plotting with a secret someone to take back control of the Mode magazine.  Run currently by Daniel Meade who's late night out short of being fired on a daily basis with his sleeping with just anyone that comes in his office or within his sights.  Until Betty Suarez walks into his life as his new assistant that doesnt fit the model, slim and at your whim mode that he's used to.  She's actually very good at her job and manages to get Daniel to change (well in some ways at least). All the while dealing with his brother Alex's ""death"" (you've gotta see that one coming).

Meanwhile Betty is trying to juggle all the things going on with her family at home.  Her father's immigration problems, her sister's job crisis and her nephew Justin. Who would fit in perfectly at Mode as he knows all about fashion, musicals and everything else that Betty is pretty clueless about.  She's also seeing Walter who she thinks is the one but isn't quite sure on that even though he ""wuvs"" her very, very much.

Her sister Hilda is dealing with ex coming back into her life and doing what he did best in the past not showing up.  But things get a bit better on that road for her as she still struggles to find her own way and niche in life.

I also love the show because of Marc the gay assitant and Amanda well for being herself.  It's great to have that in the show and helps draw more folks to a show that might not watch Ugly Betty otherwise and besides.  The way they play off of each other is just another added bonus to watch throughout the season.

The season ender ""East Side Story"" ends on a shocking and traumatic cliffhanger for the Suarez family as a tragedy rocks Hilda, Betty, and Justin.  Suffice to say the first season of Ugly Betty is off the hook and is only a slight peek into what i'm sure will be an equally great 2nd Season of a bright and upcoming show.

An excellent show with all the things listed plus a message in it as well.  Be who you are and have fun with it no matter what.",1210291200,2,2393,4.329596412556054
1587711,5,B00005JPII,"""Betty La Fea"" the Colombian ""telenovela"" this show is based on, was a ratings phenomenon.  Americanized daughters who would usually poke fun at their Latin moms for watching corny ""telenovelas"", got hooked along with their moms.  ""Macho"" dads and granddads joined their wives, daughters, and granddaughters, in laughter and sometimes with misty eyes, to watch Betty's travails; night after night.

When I first heard the show was being adapted to an American audience, I was very skeptical.  For one, Latin ""telenovelas"" last one season, with a plot arc that is designed to evolve and be resolved within 9 to 12 months.  American TV series can last several years.  How can Betty stay ugly for so long without reducing the plot's credibility?  Even if she is comfortable with herself, some of the glamour will have to rub off on her.  She will at the very least have to stop wearing her most hideous clothes mismatches  especially when her best friend at Mode is a fashion designer and can give her a few pointers to improve her image.  She will be tempted at some point to be beautified.  How will they handle this without making her abandon her true self? and how long will it take for her to do this if the series turns out to have a long run, remains to be seen.

In any case, I will be there for the long haul.  I am a total fan.  This is a great show, with lots of laugh, and lots of heart.  Every actor is incredible in their role.  The good guys are adorable, starting with Betty , her boss Daniel, Christina, Betty's family and that incredibly sweet Henry that I am totally rooting for.  As far as I'm concerned Betty and he make such a great couple if they ended the series tomorrow with the two of them ending up together, I would be ecstatic.  Even though it would be in sharp contrast to the original Betty who ended up with her boss, of course.

The bad guys, are also adorable.  So well scripted, definitely mean, but with touching human sides.  You know they are ""evil"" because they've been through some rough stuff in their life and not gratuitously so.  I love them as much as I love the good guys.  Vanessa Williams is incredible as Wilhemina Slater. Her gay assistant is amazing in his role, and so is Amanda the slutty receptionist, jealous of Betty's position.

Even minor roles, like Ignacio's immigration case worker are a treat to watch.

SPOILER:  I was shocked with Santos (Justin's father) being shot in the season finale. I am hoping he is just hurt and not dead.

This is a well-written, well-performed show, that is very funny and that will touch your heart.

1587945,5,B00005JPII,"""Ugly Betty~The Complete first Season"" is the first TV series on DVD, that I have ever purchased sight unseen. Usually I stick to shows, that I have enjoyed in the past and I know will be good on repeat viewings. With the initial price of most DVD box sets, can you blame me? But after hearing about the critical acclaim this show has received, plus that lovely face on the front box, how could I refuse? Well my gamble paid off. After thoroughly enjoying this box set, ""Ugly Betty"" has now become my favorite series currently being shown on network television.

For those who don't know the comedy/drama, ""Ugly Betty"" is about a truely aesthetically challenged (braces, glasses and huge eye brows, that Ed Asner would kill for) young woman named Betty Suarez (America Ferrera), who despite all odds gets a job at the ultra-chic, fashion magazine, 'Mode'  as the Personal-Assistant to the newly installed, Editor-in-Chief, Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius). Betty becomes Daniel's friend and protector as they stave off numerous, nefarious, soap-operish plots by Daniel's family members and employees at the magazine to dislodge the young and naive editor from his position. The villains include the glamourous, but evil, Creative Director, Wilhemina Slater (Venessa Williams), her brown nosing, assistant, Marc St. James (Michael Urie) and the catty receptionist, Amanda (Becki Newton). On top of this Betty must also deal with the trials and tribulations of her Mexican-American family which includes her father (Tony Plana), pushy sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz) and teenage nephew, Justin (Mark Indelicato) who live in a cozy household in Queens.

The above discription just scatches the surface of the various soap-operish plotlines, that goes on at 'Mode' magazine and the Suarez/Meade households. But what is so great about this show is that you basically should expect the unexpected. The plots zig & zag. The expectations are that the naive and virtuous, Betty dosn't stand a chance against the cynical and corrupt, plotting vipers, that surround her. But in the end no matter what happens, Betty usually comes out on top (if not emotionally battered and bruised) with her intergrity in place.

The colorful personalities are quite overdone but that is part of the charm of the show. As Betty makes a place for herself in a world very unlike her own, she also carves out a place in pop culture for a girl who doesn't look or act like everyone else but is genuinely happy with herself. Most chubby and awkward young women are portrayed in films as introverted misfits who desperately want to become one of the beautiful people ... and then there is Betty, surrounded by glamorous people every day at work and yet remains so at ease with herself that one can not help but love her.

1587953,5,B00005JPII,"Ugly Betty is a comedy with several ongoing plots: murder, illegal immigration, infidelity, a vendetta, and death. The perfect combination of ""Profit,"" ""Desperate Housewives,"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" with all the best elements of each: comedy, drama, hidden and transparent agendas, amoral atmosphere, fish out of water themes, and both intentional and accidental evil.

America Ferrera is excellently cast as Betty, a hapless but intelligent assistant at a top women's magazine (VOGUE?) who is a fashion casualty but still is attracted to the world of media. Her glamorous colleagues at the magazine shun her because Betty dresses in mismatched outfits thick cat-eye glasses and bizarre colored braces.

""Frenemies"" is a word coined for this series, with the glamorous, amoral and aging and unmarried Amanda (Becki Newton) and flaming gay stereotype Marc (Michael Urie), providing most of the laughs. Betty's boss Daniel (Eric Mabius...a weak choice in my book), is dull, but fabulously wealthy and handsome, so he gets more than his fair share of female attention and resists none of it. Salma Hayek--one of the show's producers--guest stars and is as usual excellent.

Betty still lives with her father, Ignacio (Tony Plana), older sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz), and nephew Justin (Mark Indelicato) and each actor is excellent and on-target in their roles as Betty's anchors.

The casting for this series is excellent for the women, and not too bad for the men. Mercifully, the director was not afraid to type cast and then push actors further into their stereotypes. The cartoon excess of some of their dimensions makes the series lively and engaging, especially since the cartoons are working through a well-unfolding plot.

Gentlemen should be warned, there is a large dose of ""ChickFlic"" ethos in this series, but nothing too hard to swallow and it is a fun romp, especially when the criminal undercurrents of intrigue and violence unfold.",1199232000,,1945,5.241157556270096
1588181,5,B00005JPII,"From my point of view, ""Ugly Betty"" is the kind of tv series that can make a fan out of you instantly, even if you watch just an episode. So if you don't have some free time you can dedicate to it every week, remember to avoid this show like the plague :)

Why is this series fun? It's about a young girl from Queens, Betty (America Ferrera), that begins to work as assistant to Daniel (Eric Mabius), the new editor-in-chief at a fashion magazine. Betty is very intelligent and kind, but has a characteristic that amounts to sin in the world of fashion: she is not beautiful. The different episodes show us how she copes with stereotypes, makes new friends, finds love and tries to fight off the people who don't like her or want to see her boss fail.

I think that you will be surprised by how good the actors in ""Ugly Betty"" are (even though special mention should be given to America Ferrara and Vanessa Williams, everybody shines). But more importantly, I believe that you will love the fact that a show that entertains also happens to deliver a strong and positive message. This tv series allows us to watch things that we take for granted from an unjaundiced point of view, that is from Betty's perspective, saying things that need to be said, but in such a way that you end up being entertained, and wanting to know what will happen next week. And then, you are hooked :)

All in all, a show to recommend...

Making a subplot about her father's ongoing attempt to get a green card was pretty daring, when the off-screen trend is just to point fingers and yell about 'those people' entering the country. The sexuality of Betty's nephew Justin (Mark Indelicato) is another recurring plot device, he is also 'different' compared to what is considered normal for twelve-year old boys, but the family does not seem offended.

The most critical plot catch is that she was intentionally picked by that head's father so he would not sleep around with his assistant. For once he will actually get stuff done and the magazine will thus succeed. In this workplace, she is the anti-heroine because the rules of the game are expecting that she look 'beautiful' but be very dumb.

I have been pleasantly surprised by Vanessa Williams's acting chops. She equally steals the scene as fashion editor Wilhelmina Slater, who is plotting to take over the magazine if given the chance. Who knew she could act well on a weekly television show?

But the best part of this show is that its schemes are light-hearted camp. They are not something which you would find going down on an American daytime/nighttime soap. I still like tuning into those, but this is the type of series which you would watch to commiserate after your own trying day in the office--and/or jobs past.

The series is especially a refreshing antidote to all of the reality shows which seem to continue polluting the networks.",1190419200,2,1941,4.831325301204819
1588364,5,B00005JPII,"I had not seen a single episode of this show when it was on the TV, but since I had heard so much positive feedback about it, I decided to check it out on DVD before the new season started. I cannot say enough how much I liked this show! It's not only funny, but poignant and relevant. America Fererra is winning as Betty, the supporting characters are very good. Highly recommended!",1190332800,,383,4.333333333333333

I am glad I picked up the Season 1 DVD though, because this show is hilarious. I was able to watch the shows obsessively and without commercials until I got to the end of the season. I was watching 4 episodes a night because I am hooked. I can't wait for season 2 to start. Betty is so adorable, the the people she works with are a scream. It's a little over the top and implausible at times, which is what makes it so funny. I am especially enjoying her potential new romance. Its nice that a tv show will address things that are kind of sensitive and off topic with humor and heart. I totally recommend it.",1189555200,,722,4.164285714285715

Each episode has it's own agenda, and the episodes always vary. Sometimes I found myself counting down the days until the next episode came on. I've seen every episode, and not one of them had me falling asleep. Who knew that the adventures of an nerd in New York could be so entertaining!",1187740800,3,407,4.298701298701299
1588479,5,B00005JPII,"20 years from now, you might get to see this on TV Land. Obviously, this show is worth buying into. You get all 23 episodes from season one. You get an up and comer-like Ugly Betty trying to become big in this cut-throat world of modeling, fashion, and making it on the front-cover of MODE magazine. Think of this show as a mixture of Ally McBeal, The Devil wears Prada, & Just Shoot Me-all in one. This show is all about Ugly Betty, and one of the show's 2 main stars, America Ferrera. Ferrera plays the strong-willed girl show a lot of bravery from the inside out. Betty Suarez is a very-brainy woman who shows off her ideas and tries to get coffee for everybody at work-now that's using her head.

This Show also Co-Stars Vanessa Williams (The Singer & Former Miss America) as Wilhelmina Slater, Betty's Arch-Nemesis. As you can see, Wilhelmina happens to be a back-stabber, and a schemer. The incredibly-tanned sister tries to do everything to become a high-level executive by hook or crook, and she tries to do everything she can-Even Marrying Brad Meade, The Chairman of MODE publishing. Brad's son Daniel happens to be Betty's Boss at her job. Wilhelmina also have her own assistant, Marc St. James-her so-called ""Personal"" seeing eye-gay.

Betty also have issues at home, too. She lives with her dad, Her big sister, Hilda and her gay son also lives there as well. I gotta hand it to you, People are buying their favorite shows so they can watch every single episode, without the distraction of commercials. I believe ABC has done something imaginable-by putting this and other great shows (LOST, Desperate Housewives, & Gray's Anatomy) out on DVD. I hope this show will win big at the Emmys in September.",1187568000,5,1713,4.706666666666667
1588480,5,B00005JPII,"I love this show.  If I didn't have some way to record it every week, this would be the one and only show I would have revolved my schedule around.

As you read (or should have read) the main plot is about a super smart girl from the city who works for a fashion magazine.  She doesn't look or act at all like them.  How did she get her job?  Her boss' father wanted her to stop him to cease sleeping with all his assistants.  Well, he stopped sleeping with the assistant (Betty) but that didn't stop him from creating chaos in other parts of his life.  Henceforth, allowing the plots of Ugly Betty to come forth.  However, the writers don't just rely on him for material.  There's Betty's family, her boss' family, her co-workers and everything and everyone else.  What amazes me about this show is how well it's written so that the drama doesn't come off as a drama, but as a comedy (excluding the season finale).  It's also written so well that there are no loose ends and no thoughts of ""Well, that was stupid!"" left in the viewers' minds.

I have to say my favorite character is Betty's nephew.  As the description says, he's either gay or going to be gay.  His character is very effervescent and with it.  He's not afraid to show his metro-sexual side.  He blends so well with Betty's male frenemy.

Onto the actors and actresses.  America.  Love her.  I 'discovered' her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-Women-Have-Curves/dp/B000AM4P90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real Women Have Curves</a>.  She's fabulous and knows how to play the 'dumb'/smart girl to a tee. Other than a few of the other actresses, I'm not to familiar with anybody else.  But, I have to admit I started watching the show simply because I'm a fan of America's.  This isn't to say she carries it.  The cast including the writers and director(s) do as well. But I love America.

If you have never seen the show, you have to rent it and watch it.  You will not be able to just watch one episode, trust me.  Too much happens to too many characters.",1187481600,5,2070,4.7254901960784315
1588481,5,B00005JPII,"Comedies, while they are by definition amusing (or should be) are often so at someone's expense.  I feared this would be true of Ugly Betty  which I pegged as a one joke show and avoided for several weeks at the beginning of the season.  I don't know why I began watching, but I'm thrilled that I did because I was dead wrong.  This is no one trick pony, but rather an intelligent and very humane series which just happens to rely on some very sharp humor to make its observations about the human condition.

As we do in life, we meet new characters and see only the side of them they're willing to show to the world.  Some you like instantly, some... not so much.  But little-by-little, as you come to know each of them, you learn who they really are.  The ugly jokes  which persist on the surface become commentaries on those who make them.  You may not like these people, but you understand something of what makes them tick, and in the end, you're pulling for them to grow, and change, and become better people.

Ugly Betty is blessed with a cast that is nothing short of brilliant.  They are capable of both under and over-playing for effect, and sometimes leave me slack-jawed with admiration for their deft interpretations of the complexities of their characters.  The scripts can move from mad to sad and back again in a matter of minutes, and while they're not without their flaws (The arc about Ignacio's amorous immigration officer thudded over all, though it did provide some very funny moments, and one which was tremendously touching.) they've been good enough that I would recommend the series to anyone.",1187395200,21,1619,4.618881118881119

This show has Heart and soul, it's funny and sad at the time. The story line has twists and turns and the hour flies so fast! I am guessing most people that come to view this time will already be fans and I don't need to tell you how great this show is.
As for the 2 reviews I read that didn't like UB, well nothing is for everyone and lord knows there is plenty of TV I can't get into or dislike so to each his own, but Ugly Betty is the best show in years for my tv!",1187222400,18,588,3.712
1588483,5,B00005JPII,"Ignore the 2 posts that say this isn't good. They either didn't actually watch this or have no sense of humor.  I have waited and waited for a good comedy to come along.  I can't remember the last time I found a comedy that I felt was worth even a half an hour of my time - it's been years - literally.

I came across Betty by accident and was in love right away. It can be very silly, but it manages to do it in a clever and sometimes endearing way.  There's just enough drama to make you care about the characters.  The stories are fresh and funny and if you watch it alone you will be chomping at the bit for someone to talk to when it ends.

My mom, who is nearly 70 watches it, my younger sister who has very different tastes to me watches it and my husband, who at first was resistant, got hooked after one episode.

There are characters and plots to appeal to everyone.

Take it all with a very good natured grain of salt.  It's meant to be campy fun.  If you try to view each little piece under a microscope and determine how realistic you think it is then you're better off watching the History Channel or the Discovery Channel.  This is living fiction and you should give yourself over to it and fully enjoy it.  You'll be amazed how quickly the hour passes.

All of the actors are excellent in their roles, with the possible exception of Rebecca Romein, who does a very good job, but not as good as the rest of the cast, in my opinion. The characters of Marc, Amanada and Justin often steal the scenes and sometimes the show.

If you are the type of person who can enjoy a clever campy show mixed with a bit of drama and the occasional dash of pathos then Ugly Betty is a dream come true.",1187222400,7,1699,4.140243902439025
1588484,5,B00005JPII,"I can't wait for this DVD to be released.

They had to do a real job on America Ferrera to make her ""ugly"" and still didn't hit the mark; she is adorable, inside AND out, even whle sporting a hideous poncho loudly proclaiming ""Guadalajara"" to all and sundry and an even more hideous replica of the unfortunate Anne Boleyn's necklace that she wears in every episode (Betty, not Anne Boleyn, who lost her head, along with her necklace, ages ago). She even dares to wear the poncho and necklace together (gasp), breaking at least half of the sartorial commandments with one stroke.

Naughty girl.

Ugly Betty is over the top and campier than William Shatner in a tutu but then, so is the fashion industry. It can get a little preachy at times and the political agenda is as obvious as Betty's braces, but heap big fun to watch.

1588486,1,B00005JPII,"I saw a while ago a clip online from some show David Spade has on Comedy Central and he basically hit the nail flat on the head with this show;

oh man, you throw some glasses, braces and a quirky wardrobe on a semi-hot actress and all of a sudden she's incredibly ugly, how completely hilarious; yeah, no.

""oh, hey, she looks like me, she's awkward, has braces and glasses, awesome what's the name of this fantastic sho...ugly betty? *kills self*""

and to quote a great comedian, ""how do you think ugly people feel when someone says ""this is gonna get ugly""?  ""well, this doesn't affect me.""

alright, that's totally unrelated, but hilarious none the less.  unlike this bottom of the barrel, horribly written and utterly overblow, cliche american television; not ALL american TV is a joke, HBO has dished out some classic stuff, but that's HBO, not NBC, the channel that hasn't had anything worth watching in over 6 years.",1184284800,11,924,4.708074534161491
1588487,5,B00005JPII,"Ugly Betty is a show set around an 'unattractive' secretary at a fashion magazine. Based on the Colombian telenovela ""Betty La Fea.""  It's excellent and I watch or tape it each week.
Betty works for Mode magazine (hired by the publisher of the magazine, to be his son's secretary because he knew she'd never someone his son (Daniel) would sleep with) - an upscale fashion magazine where being thin is the rule and dressing the part as important.  It's obvious from the beginning that Betty doesn't fit the mold but she ploughs through anyway - sometimes wanting to pack it all in but she does hang in there.
It is definately the best new show of the season and won several Golden Globes and rightly so.  America Ferrara (who I loved in Real Women Have Curves) does a fantastic job and while she may seem ugly (to some) in her physical appearance, she is the nicest staff member at Mode.  Her hard work and determination earns her boss's respect.  She is a caring, friendly girl who is dedicated to her job and her family and I love to watch her trials and tribulations each week.  It's such a fun show that ultimately has a message that it isn't what's on the outside that counts (or shouldn't count).  I think this is something that most people would really enjoy and get a laugh from and hopefully learn not to judge people harshly because of the way they look.",1184198400,12,1363,4.493927125506073
