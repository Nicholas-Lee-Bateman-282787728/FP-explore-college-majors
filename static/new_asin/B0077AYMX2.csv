5060248,1,B0077AYMX2,"This movie bills itself as something it is not... worth your time. The acting is horrible. The plot is so drawn out I actually found myself begging for a power surge to knock out my dvd player. Thank God I borrowed this from someone and did not actually pay money for it. I have seen better acting and filming from a 1970's porno. Special effects are enough to make one vomit with outrage. Please for the sake of little kittens, DO NOT buy this. Thank you.",1387584000,2,456,4.313953488372093

5060251,3,B0077AYMX2,"Night Wolf/ 13 Hrs is a 2010 British horror flick starring Isabella Calthorpe, Gemma Atkinson and Tom Felton, better known as Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies.

The film is very well done for what it is; a low-budget British horror. There's a storyline which has actually had a bit of thought put into it, the special effects aren't the worst, the acting is acceptable and the relationships between the characters is well established from early in the movie.

However, I found it difficult to sympathise with many or indeed any of the characters in this film for the simple reason that they are on the whole, over-privileged, arrogant and generally unlikeable with very little in the way of redeeming qualities. In fact, it was a delight to watch many of them meet their end. Moreover, I struggled to look at Tom Felton and think of him as anything other than Draco Malfoy. Of all the actors, I was most surprised by the performance of Gemma Atkinson who was able to demonstrate a greater range than that of mere eye candy and monster fodder.

The feel of the film is that the group was genuinely trapped within the house and as is necessary with any horror film made in the 21st century, there's an explanation for the absence of mobile phones from anyone's person that allows the movie to progress nicely towards a fairly predictable horror flick ending.

The film was comfortable within its 85 minute running time but feel that some gore, death scenes and shots of the beast are gracing the cutting room floor for the sake of getting this particular flick a ""15"" certification and therefore a potentially wider audience. Boooooooo!

I've certainly seen worse horror movies and definitely shoddier domestic productions. All in all, I would suggest that this one is fairly middle of the road but could certainly have benefited from a bit more ""horror"" in this horror movie.",1352505600,2,1883,4.781538461538462
5060252,2,B0077AYMX2,"Set in the murky English countryside, NIGHT WOLF could have been a worthy werewolf saga.  The operable word here is COULD; poor lighting, a muddled, predictable script and weak performances sabotage the film's effectiveness.  The effects are likewise unimaginative and the movie employs lots of screaming and jittery camera work to elicit the suspense.
Isabella Calthorpe and REVENGE's Joshua Bowman struggle but can't overcome the material.  AMERICAN WEREWOLF and THE HOWLING are still the most enjoyable wolf-tales.  Watch them instead.",1339372800,2,538,5.6875
5060253,1,B0077AYMX2,"One of the reasons I decided to give this a try was because of the ""From one of the producers of Dog Soldiers"" on the cover.  Dog Soldiers is a great a movie.  Unfortunately, the producer they got for this film must have been the one that sucked, cause this movie was bad.  The ""big name"" Tom Felton is killed off early on, leaving you with some truly horrific acting.  The special effects were less than lack luster.  And if that wasn't bad enough, the ""werewolf"" looked truly horrible.  I've seen better makeup on kids at halloween.
The only good thing about the movie was......
wait..there wasn't any.
Absolutely don't waste your time on this, unless you want to see the crappiest werewolf movie since Full Moon High. (at least that was comical!)",1337558400,4,749,4.593984962406015
5060254,4,B0077AYMX2,i gave it 4 stars cuz it was much better than expected.........i felt it was a good solid horror movie.........i liked the special fx's with the wolf creature.... overall once the action started it kept a good pace........and the irish or scottish (not sure which one ) background & accents made for a nice touch :):)  if ur a horror fan give this movie a chance.....i thought it was a decent horror flick !!!,1336176000,9,409,4.527027027027027
5060255,2,B0077AYMX2,"This appears to be a re-release of the 2010 film called ""13 hours.""

Sarah (Isabella Calthorpe), who has been away from home for a long time, returns to England from LA. The house is being remodeled. We are introduced to Duncan (Simon MacCorkindale), Sarah's stepfather. There are some bill issues and mom is away for...? but will return in a couple of days. She is accused of keeping a boyfriend and draining the family of money. Sarah joins her brother out in the garage/barn where we are introduced to the rest of the gang. She has 3 brothers: Steven (Peter Gadiot),Charlie (Gabriel Thomson), and Luke (Antony De Liseo). Doug (Joshua Bowman) is a playboy and a friend of the guys. Emily (Gemma Atkinson) is Steven's girlfriend, formerly Doug's girlfriend as so crudely pointed out by Gary (Tom Felton)another party animal.

After we get the basic idea of who all these people are, under a full moon and a power outage, the drunk stoned party moves to the big house with flashlights and candles....only to discover the terror that occupies the house. (If you have read the title or looked at the cover, you got a good idea what is there.)

The creature makes noises that sound like ""Predator"" apparently an easy noise to duplicate as all the horror films have gone to it. The ""night wolf"" moves through the house by jerking around an infra-red camera. The movie was a fairly good idea that was poorly executed and suffered from the lack of decent special effects. I thought the support cast of Tom Felton and Gemma Atkinson were great. Isabella Calthorpe left much to be desired.

F-bombs, sex talk, no real nudity. Pot smoking, drinking.",1335571200,9,1640,4.743859649122807

5060283,5,B0077AYMX2,"This is more of the classic style werewolf movie when people are in the forest at night and get attacked repeatedly by a monster resembling a large wolf.

5060284,4,B0077AYMX2,"I do not have too much to write. I would like a sequel to Night Wolf. The first Night Wolf so was good that a person wants some more of the story done in the same style and exploring the same likable characters further. I liked that Night Wolf had different dynamics than the usual story. A group of siblings, instead of unrelated friends, must confront some very ugly and monstrous goings-on around them. The movie resembles The Hamiltons, The Gate, or Flowers in the Attic to some extent. And, these kids are not the usual morons that the Scream franchise mocks for appearing in horror film after horror film. No, these youths are as thoughtful and erudite as the protagonists in April Fool's Day. These characters are as resourceful as the final girl in Halloween or You're Next, yet they are realistically scared ""witless"" as anyone would be in their circumstances.
I liked that Night Wolf does not show the wolf too much. BUT, it does not spare viewers brief glimpses at the monster's great carnage. The audience's imagination gets to scare the hell out of the audience. I like that.
I liked the performances. I liked the violence and nudity. I liked the mystery and suspense throughout. I liked the after-credits scene foreshadowing a possible sequel. Generally, I liked Night Wolf. You might too.",1389657600,8,1303,4.769911504424779
