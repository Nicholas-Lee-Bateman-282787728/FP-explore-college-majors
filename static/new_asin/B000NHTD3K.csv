You want a great collection of Driver's Ed films that will play in your DVD player, and with this buy, you'll get one. The quality doesn't suffer one bit. It is a good investment.

I'm sitting watching the first film, ""Last Date,"" and realizing that I got more than I bargained for. Dick York? Hell yeah! Of course, this film is geared toward girls, warning them of the trouble ""bad boys"" can get them into. Seriously, though. DICK FREAKIN YORK!!!

Next is ""Road Runners."" This one is aimed at getting teens to bring their competitive tendencies to the drag strip, instead of endangering the public by racing or driving aggressively on the streets. I guess this one could come in handy if you have a speed demon child. Definitely not a ""shock and scare"" film.

Now comes ""None for the Road,"" a film about drinking and driving. The acting is endearing; reminiscent of a high school play. It features an interesting experiment showing the difference between not drinking, drinking just to catch a buzz, and getting sloppy drunk. It ends with a poignant twist. I really liked this one.

""A Cool Hot Rod"" takes a teenager who is numb to getting traffic tickets, or rather proud of it, and subjects him to peer justice. Like ""Road Runners,"" this film focuses on proper outlet for the need for speed, as well as maintaining your car's safety systems. Then for a long while, it goes into working hard and being rewarded. Not being a gear head, I didn't enjoy this much. The film could have been a lot shorter.

And now, ""Signal 30,"" the creme de la creme of olde tyme Driver's Ed films. This one is much more ""to the point."" Steering away from what a bummer it is to get a traffic ticket, and into the often terrible and sometimes tragic consequences of failing to obey traffic laws. Speeding, running stop signals, failing to yield the right of way, and distracted driving are all covered here. The pain you'll feel while watching these beaten, broken, burned and expired bodies being extricated will be real, because the pain you are watching is real. The pain of the families, the pain of the living victims, and the pain that was finally relieved by sweet, merciful death. This is the one I hope to show the children in my life once they reach driving age.

""Stop Driving Us Crazy."" This is a whimsical cartoon about Martians learning about automobiles on Earth. It combines stern warnings and rules about driving etiquette with the 10 commandments. Very entertaining. It has to be seen to be believed.

""Live and Let Live"" is a stop-motion piece that uses physics and statistics, combined with sensible lecturing to encourage safe driving. There's not much to say about this one, except that it tells the message well. Definitely worth the watch.

""The Other Fellow"" is a very cute film about a pompous idiot who is more concerned with the driving habits of others, than with his own. A great watch with a great lesson.",1319241600,4,3023,4.658536585365853
8177738,5,B000NHTD3K,"A good compilation.  Easily recommended. This DVD takes me back to those high school days learning to drive.  This includes all the films we were shown to instill proper respect for the highway, or not. Amazing to see again and recall the emotions of seeing ""reality film"" in the 1960's.  It is fun to critique these films after years of driving experience, and after years of volunteering in EMS and seeing how things were done ""then"" versus now. For the younger folks it is a revelation of history, the old cars, clothes, and philosophy of new drivers education.  Be aware, it has raw footage, graphic car wrecks, and straight talk by the narrators.",1229299200,4,651,4.734513274336283
8177739,1,B000NHTD3K,"This is a DVD-R.  The films themselves are fine, but it should be mentioned in the description that these are burns and not factory DVDs.",1210809600,8,137,4.48
