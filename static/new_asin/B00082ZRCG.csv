8055452,4,B00082ZRCG,"More over Jonathan and Jennifer. The 1950's TV equivalent of ""Hart to Hart"" was the offbeat murder-mystery series MR. & MRS. NORTH. When it became apparent that Richard Denning wasn't going to be automatically re-cast opposite Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy"" (the show inspired by the radio serial ""My Favourite Husband"" in which he had starred with Ball), Denning took the role of Jerry North, a publisher who also dabbles in sleuthing with his lovely wife Pamela (Barbara Britton).

MR. & MRS. NORTH was based on a series of novellas written by Richard Lockridge; the characters were later featured in a long-running radio serial, which started out in 1946 and ended up airing concurrently with the TV series (which debuted in 1952). The TV series of MR. & MRS. NORTH, sponsored by Revlon Cosmetics, played on CBS from 1952-53, and was later picked up by NBC for additional episodes in 1954.

Episodes:

""Million Dollar Coffin"" - Jerry is hoping to discover a set of priceless letters buried with a Revolutionary War patriot, whose grave happens to be near the hiding place of stolen bank loot.

""Model for Murder"" - Pam enrolls for classes at Don Santiago's School for Models, where a dangerous love triangle leads to murder.

""The Man Who Came to Murder"" - The Norths arrive at the Honeymoon Inn for their fifth anniversary, only to have their romantic weekend spoiled by the discovery of a body in the kitchen pantry.

""Mask of Hate"" - Turmoil between the Norths' friend Gordon Lane and his wife Marion turns deadly. Marion is having a secret affair with a coworker, while her husband, paralyzed and bedridden since a horrible car accident, harbors a secret of his own.",1130630400,6,1672,4.828671328671328
8055453,5,B00082ZRCG,"Mr. & Mrs. North is a very early TV series that enjoyed a long run. That they are being released on DVD all these years later is fortunate indeed as in viewing this fourth DVD of the series shows how well a series can hold up for todays viewer. This series had good acting & well written scripts for the light mystery/comedy genere. Barbara Britton & Richard Denning were perfect in the roles. 4 episodes per DVD means there should be more to come as this once popular series finds a new audiance.

One wishes producers of other early shows would show as much interest as Mr.& Mrs. Norths, & release other great early TV shows. This is one series worth owning.",1125187200,10,660,4.409836065573771
