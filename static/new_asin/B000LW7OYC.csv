2715674,3,B000LW7OYC,"Cost and delivery were perfect. But I was a tad disappointed that it really wasn't the whole show. I'd be much happier if it wasn't so documentative. And once again the cover is deceiving, because that scene is not in the actual dvd.",1267574400,,233,4.441860465116279
2715675,4,B000LW7OYC,"I have a tendancy to not check out the product information as thouroughly as I should.  Remembering how much my brother and I were helped with our reading from watching The Electric Company, I got it to help my kids with their reading.  So when I got this DVD, I was surprised to learn that it was a documentary.  I was a little disapointed, because I knew they would never sit through a documentary.  But I so enjoyed hearing the anecdotes, I decided to keep it for myself.",1257292800,,474,4.3522727272727275
2715676,2,B000LW7OYC,"Yes, as some of the others have said it is a documentary. I found it on another website and have to say that the title and descriptions I found pre-purchase were not clear about the content. Hits and Bits? More like snip-its and interviews. Now I see the ""The best of the best"" and I'm skeptical. Is their version of ""the best"" what I remember as being so awesome? I wasn't planning on dropping $35-$50 each for Volumes 1 & 2. I should've checked in with Amazon reviews first.",1243728000,,476,4.359550561797753
2715677,5,B000LW7OYC,"This DVD brought back very fond memories.  The skits, the songs, the people who made this show work.  And, of course, The Adventures of Letterman.  That, and the Spiderman skits, were my favorite parts of the show.  This DVD also opened my eyes, too.  I was surprised by the very famous people who were part of the show, but never got credit for their work on the Friday credit roll.  If you were, or still are, a fan of this groundbreaking show, get this DVD.  Trust me, it'll a great trip down memory lane.",1237248000,,508,4.340425531914893
2715678,5,B000LW7OYC,"Yep the original is still great,  a fun trip down memory lane for any 30+ something growing up in the 70's.  Outfits are Groovy! and the lessons are timeless.  Let's hope the new version is as much fun.",1234396800,,202,4.2631578947368425
2715679,2,B000LW7OYC,"I am  a kindergarten teacher and I have been using the electric company videos in classroom  for a couple of years for language arts.  I thought that this dvd was more shows,  it turned out to be more interviews than anythings else.  My students love watching the shows.",1228608000,3,270,4.541666666666667
2715680,3,B000LW7OYC,"This is a documentary with interviews from the original cast and a good description of the history of the Electric Company.  This is, however, not something that will be easy or as fun to watch for your children, since only a few of the Electric Company skits are actually shown between the various interviews.

Buy this if you want to learn the history of the show and watched it as a child.  Don't buy this if you want your kids to enjoy it with you.",1225670400,19,452,4.294117647058823
2715681,4,B000LW7OYC,"This video is full of old, funny routines and cartoons from Electric Company. It also includes more recent interviews with the actors from the series.  It's more of a reminiscence than an episode from the actual show.",1194307200,8,217,4.864864864864865
2715682,4,B000LW7OYC,"First shown on PBS, ""The Electric Company's Greatest Hits and Bits"" is a fun look back at the 1970's TV Show. It consists of several clips from the show as well as interviews with cast members Skip Hinnant, Jim Boyd, Rita Moreno and Judy Graubart as well as contributors to the show Joan Rivers and Tom Lehrer. There is also an interview with Joan Ganz Cooney who helped create the show. The special features include deleted interviews with the cast members and an audio review with Tom Lehrer.

For the most part, ""The Electric Company's Greatest Hits and Bits"" is an enjoyable documentary. At the time it debuted in October 1971 it was a groundbreaking show with a fully integrated cast teaching children how to read using comedy and music. It's always fun to watch a show as an adult that you loved as a kid and catch some of the references you missed back then. Easy Reader was of course based on Easy Rider but it was interesting to hear Skip Hinnant say that he stole largely from ""Get Smart"" when doing Fargo North, Decoder; Jim Boyd saying J. Arthur Crank was based on Ralph Cramden; and Rita Moreno saying ""Hey you guys"" came from Abbott and Costello. There are plenty of clips from the show including animated ones such as ""The Adventures of Letterman"" and several based on Tom Lehrer's delightful songs including ""Silent E"" and ""-ly"". The live action skits include ""I'm in love with a giant"" and ""The Super is eating his supper"" which is fun to watch just to see the cast trying to keep a straight face as water pours down on them.

Since this is a documentary and not full episodes of ""The Electric Company"" adults will probably enjoy this DVD more than children. It does have quite a bit of praise for Morgan Freeman, currently the most famous of the then unknown actors, but it stops just short of going overboard on the praise. While it was nice to see Hinnant, Boyd, and Graubart, I hope other actors from the show such as Luis Avalos, Hattie Winston, and Lee Chamberlain show up in interviews on future DVDs. For some reason the show focuses solely on the adult members of the cast, with no mention at all of the Short Circus and the child actors, a bit surprising since Irene Cara was a member of the Short Circus for awhile.

""The Electric Company's Greatest Bits and Hits"" is good nostalgic fun.",1174867200,37,2315,4.533492822966507
2715683,5,B000LW7OYC,"Not sure what a lot of the other reviewers expectations were, or what their definition of a documentary is, but I'm glad I didn't listen to them and decided to buy it. I have Best of Electric Company Vol 1 and Vol 2 and they are both excellent, and my 6 year old daughter LOVES them.  This dvd does have interview footage that a lot of kids might be bored by, but the interview clips are brief and they all lead up to great skits. Again, the other reviews (many of them) imply that there are hardly any skits. There are 20+ skits in this -- not sure how many they were hoping for but this dvd is great and includes lots of great extra footage for you and your beginning readers to enjoy. To be clear, this is not for kids under 5 - they won't appreciate it. This is for kindergarden thru 4th grade ideally. The Electric Company was without a doubt the best kids television program ever created, and remains so to this day. It is highly entertaining, edgy, funny, progressive, and not all santized and boring like a lot of current kids television today. Hey you guys!!!! It's awesome.",1392422400,2,1083,4.334975369458128
2715684,5,B000LW7OYC,"This is a wonderful walk down memory lane. But it has interviews and commentary throughout the entire length of the video, interspersed between the clips from the actual show. So my child loves the show clips, but is bored to tears by the commentary. It's a great video for the grownup, but not as entertaining as a child would like it to be.",1357689600,,342,4.444444444444445
2715685,4,B000LW7OYC,I don't care for the interview and all the talking inbetween episodes and didn't know it was like this when I bought it BUT my daughter loves the DVD and doesnt care about the interviews.  Still a great DVD!!!,1347062400,,209,4.358974358974359
2715686,1,B000LW7OYC,This is not a greatest clips collection. This is the Making of The Electric Company. I got this for my 6 year old who loves the old EC shows and she learns great literacy concepts from the old shows. This particular DVD is just commentary and discussion and very few actual show clips.,1332115200,5,285,4.39622641509434
2715687,3,B000LW7OYC,"This is an interesting little documentary which could work as an introduction for those of us across the Atlantic who have never seen The Electric Company in it's natural habitat. Unfortunately it never seems to make up it's mind whether it is intended as nostalgia or as an explanation of the educational intention.

The interviews with the very personable presenters are about what you'd expect for this kind of 'clips and quips' and everyone seems genuinely proud of what they made - and rightly so. Neither Bill Cosby nor Morgan Freeman appear, which seems a shame.

The Electric Company's Greatest Hits and Bits is defintitely documentary-lite style programme making but is jolly viewing and well worth the low price asked.",1322092800,,728,5.058333333333334
2715688,5,B000LW7OYC,Gave this as a gift to my daughter.  The collection was high powered and fun to watch. We as parents had seen the originals on PBS.  Nicely done with great episodes.,1320451200,,165,4.290322580645161
2715689,5,B000LW7OYC,This is certainly a trip back into time when I was a child and now my young 5 year old is in love with it too. Goes to show that great programming doesn't get old but better with time.,1310947200,,184,3.7435897435897436
2715690,5,B000LW7OYC,"This is a fun collection of excerpts from this show.  It was enough to whet my whistle for more, so I've now ordered a DVD of entire programs.  I'd forgotten what an array now-big-names were on the Electric Company.",1304035200,2,215,4.487179487179487
2715691,1,B000LW7OYC,I thought this was an electric company video but mostly it was more of a commentary on how it got started...  of absolutely no interest to my children.,1278115200,3,151,4.392857142857143
2715692,4,B000LW7OYC,"""The Electric Company"" should be regarded as an important piece of children's educa-tional televisions history. Even with the more recent version of this show aired on PBS stations today, I feel that the children of the new generations should watch the original T.E.C. at least once. It was one of the shows that launched the movie car-eer of actor, Morgan Freeman (aka ""Easy Reader"" in the original show). Comedian and Movie/TV actor, Bill Cosby was on the show for a few seasons. It's interesting to see what these celebrities were like when they were on the first T.E.C. The theme song from the original T.E.C. and the 80's sitcom, ""Three's Company"" was writ-ten by the same song writer. ""The Electric Company"" (original) is a timeless work and a great collector's item to be enjoyed by all.

8164668,3,B000LW7OYC,"The problem is I wish there would have been more clips. And that a lot of the ones shown weren't from the two best of box sets because I already have those. While it's nice to hear from the cast and hear behind the scenes info, I bought this to see the animated and live action clips. And it's hard to focus on a clip when it's being interrupted to tell me some random thing about it. It would be hard to place kids in front of this because they'd get bored of all the adults talking. All this being said, there are some great clips here: the tion song, the ly song, the plumber and the parrot, Millie the helper. But only a few of these clips aren't on the best of sets. And those can be viewed for free on YouTube. Save your money.",1488240000,3,733,4.027397260273973

8164673,5,B000LW7OYC,I remember watching this show when I was in the third grade and learning from it so I purchased this set as an aide in teaching my 6  and 7 year old how to pronounce and read words and it's working like a charm. They are reading words at their age that I didn't know when I was their age and they're able to recognize each syllable and put them together to complete words.

However, the use of such great stars from such a large cultural diversity was the most exciting feature.  Thank you, CTW for introducing me to Morgan Freeman and Rita Moreno outside of the movies.",1393718400,,373,4.78125
