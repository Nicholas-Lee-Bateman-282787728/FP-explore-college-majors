1949702,3,B0000V6SD2,"This is a variety collection of related Sherlock Holmes films, some very old, some cartoons and radio programs, and classic films by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce and by Ronald Howard and H Marion Crawford. There is a 1954 TV series of 39 episodes of these two actors which feature one episode; The cunningham Heritage depicting how the team of Holmes and Watson first met. There is an old Boris Karloff movie ""Killer Bees"" in which Boris Karloff portrays a detective who solves a mystery Sherlock Holmes style. It's a ""bits and pieces"" kind of set having some interesting material for true Sherlock Holmes fans.  It contains the first ever film featuring the Sherlock Holmes character of A.C.Doyle. Also there is a more complete personal chat by Arthur Conan Doyle on film which shows his dog as well. 12-1/2 hrs; 6 disks; all black and white; 6 or more are silent films; none have been remastered; none by Jeremy Brett or later actors but a lot of material and Sherlock history for a very good price. I paid $ 11.49 which included shipping May 2014.",1419811200,4,1052,4.686486486486486
1949703,4,B0000V6SD2,"Sherlock Holmes Four Classic Films

This set contains four movies that were adapted from Sherlock Holmes stories. A. Conan Doyle wrote the first long story in 1887, the short stories in the 1890s. These stories have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and preserve the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading. Read the individual reviews for more information on each movie.

Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon [1942] tells of a plot to steal a bombsight to aid a foreign power. Its four parts are produced in separate factories [as a security measure]. Will foreign agents be able to steal this secret weapon?

Sherlock Holmes and the Woman in Green [1945] tells about a number of unsolved murders. Holmes deduces the scheme but lacks evidence. He visits Lydia at her home then encounters danger. Can help arrive in time?

Terror By Night [1946] is about an expensive diamond which brings bad luck to its owner. Sherlock Holmes will guard it. There is a murder in a railway carriage, one of the passengers must be the murderer!

Dressed to Kill [1946] is about stolen music boxes. One has an engraved plate that can be used to print counterfeit 5 notes that cant be distinguished from genuine 5 notes! Can Sherlock Holmes recover the plates and catch the criminals?",1418342400,,1565,4.912878787878788
1949704,4,B0000V6SD2,"This is a varied assortment of Holmes filmed memorabilia, from the first silent film (1901) to oddities and parodies, as well as classic Holmes tales with Eille Norwood, Basil Rathbone, and others playing the role.",1400284800,,214,5.142857142857143
1949705,3,B0000V6SD2,"Please be advised that this is an odd assortment and not a Basil Rathbone collection. There is only one Rathbone movie in this set- '...Secret Weapon'. Rathbone fans are not getting a Basil Rathbone filmfest. There are some early classics including a  silent film  from 1900 billed as the first Sherlock Holmes film and it is nice to see a bit of a variety  just to see some others in the part and Holmesian history but there are 3 Ronald Howard T.V. episodes (to me, a very poor choice for Holmes) and radio shows and Nigel Bruce audition films and it is this oddball collection that seems to make up a huge portion of the 12-plus hours. If you're into just anything Holmes and love to collect, then buy this set. If you want Basil Rathbone, this ain't it. Good for a collector though. Maybe very good for a collector but not for the casual.",1394236800,15,842,4.419354838709677
1949706,5,B0000V6SD2,"I ordered this for my Dad for Christmas, last minute. It arrived ON TIME and was exactly what he wanted, at a lower price than I had seen elsewhere!",1390003200,,148,4.137931034482759
1949707,4,B0000V6SD2,"The highlight of this Sherlock Holmes set is its coverage of  examnples of film from the very earliest Silent Movie of Holmes through to the Basil Rathbone years. Some of the early works are a bit shifty in places but well worth the experience. Later films are better, some even have a ""restored"" feel. The sound on most discs is suprisingly good. If you are a collector, as I am, this is a must-have set. The price is good, service is great, and all well worth a place in your DVD library.",1385424000,3,490,4.326086956521739

8003633,1,B0000V6SD2,"Not at all what I was looking for as a gift. Basil Rathbone is listed as the star but he is in only one film on the complete set and one recorded episode. His name was only promoted on the set to sell a basically over priced mediocre collection that doesn't include as many Sherlock holmes ""films"" as the description claims. This was a Christmas gift for someone and I'm embarrassed to give it to them. I guess everything on amazon is too good to be true.",1513382400,,455,4.241379310344827
