2864706,2,B000REQTA4,"Sorry, but I've a much better print of this film on vhs, bolder, brighter colors. I bought this only because the SINISTER CINEMA catalog listed their version of this film as having "" GOOD COLOR ""......Maybe that means faded washed-out color is good, I don't know. All I do know is that if you already have this gem of an Italian Sci-Fi film on vhs then you're probably better off sticking to what you have then going here. Maybe, in the far distant future some dvd company will see fit to give this film the proper release it deserves, along with other Italian Sci-Fi classics like WAR OF THE PLANETS, WILD, WILD, PLANET, and SNOW DEVILS being offered by WARNER BROS. on dvd-r at far too much $$$...Give us fans of such stuff a break!!!
Go to OLDIES.com, they often run WARNER BROS. dvds at a pretty good discount. That's where I'm ordering my copies of WAR OF THE PLANETS, WAR BETWEEN THE PLANETS and SNOW DEVILS.
As for BATTLE OF THE WORLDS, I guess I'll just have to go on waiting until some major company steps up and releases this classic. Come on, it has one of Claude Raines best performances as well as being one of Giuliano Gemma's (PISTOL FOR RINGO, ARIZONA COLT) first billed roles.
Sorry again, but even as this is a real miss from Sinister Cimema, go to their web site and order any Spaghetti Western title that's listed as 35mm/scope. They're ALL GREAT!!!! I finally got a chance to see BULLETS DON'T ARGUE, the Rod Cameron Spaghetti Western that was the main feature being shot with back-up money being channelled into the low-next to nothing budgeted A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. FISTFUL made history and BULLETS DON'T ARGUE is all but forgotten, 'tho is was destined to be THE MAJOR FEATURE.
Let me tell you, it's really a pretty good movie and I enjoyed it a lot...looks as though it had been shot yesterday.
So forget their crappy BATTLE OF THE WORLDS, my monotary loss, hopefully not your's, but check out their Spaghetti Western selection which offers some pretty great stuff.",1319414400,8,1990,4.592696629213483
2864707,4,B000REQTA4,"... the special effects are so much craft and by their way  fun. Movie valuable if you have the taste of naive, but not remarkable for its ability to charm and influence, focusing on atmosphere rather than the budget.
Second S.F. feature  by A. Margheriti, aka A.M. Dawson, after Space Men (1960) which was signed with the pseudonym of Anthony Daisies. Screenplay by Vasily Petrov, a pseudonym of Ennio De Concini. Filmed with few resources and a great visual grace, but with special effects craft interesting suggestions metaphysical. Unforgettable zombie-aliens. Rains still in great shape.Italian title: Il pianeta degli Uomini Spenti; (Planet of the Men dead); reissued in '70 as "" Planetary Wars"". An italian Quatermass, more valuable if we consider the ability to work with Margaret in a few means available. The film is beautiful and enriched by the presence of Claude Rains, hired by the production because ""it was cheap."" Another jewel of Margheriti",1274745600,,959,5.101910828025478
2864708,2,B000REQTA4,"I NEED SAY NO MORE THAN MY TITLE. THE 2 STARS THAT I HAVE GIVEN THE FILM IS FOR THE PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY ACTOR, CLAUDE RAINS. HE WORKED WITH WHAT FEW THINGS HE HAD. The only reason rains was in the film, was to get a free holiday to Italy. I would not recommend this film, but if you are a Rains fanatic, then I would not recommend this distributor, except for maybe the Rains film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Mind-The-Clairvoyant-1935/dp/B000W9SEX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Mind (""The Clairvoyant"") (1935)</a>.",1210204800,,578,5.892857142857143
8200081,2,B000REQTA4,"Not a big fan of the Italian-style of pacing and direction in movie making.  Claude Rains chewing the scenery was kind of hard to take as well.  Due to the general condition of the movie I can only assume it's not a transfer from a remastered print.  I would rate the quality of the print as only fair.  All in all, you might want a copy to complete an oldie Science Fiction collection.  Otherwise, there's not much to endorse.",1503705600,,427,4.3544303797468356

8200084,3,B000REQTA4,"Let me get the technical stuff out of the way - the volume is a little low on this one, the contrast isn't that great, and the picture is a bit fuzzy. The worst part is when the aliens finally appear, and we can barely tell them from the background; I still have no idea what they look like. Maybe it's nostalgia, but I feel like we got a much better picture when this was shown on TNT late at night back in the 90's.

In any case, this is a low-budget sci-fi movie, and it shows. The FX are practically non-existent, the dialog is awkward, and the acting is all over the map, tho nobody was bad enough to spoil the experience. The beginning is actually a bit slow - imagine entire theater and TV audiences sitting still for this stuff and then cry a little at how our attention span has withered over the decades. I almost stopped watching, but what saved the show, for me, anyway, was the character Benson.

Benson is this wonderful, crusty, horrible old man, at once pushed aside to potter in his lair and yet still feared and respected by his colleagues at the science station. He tells everyone exactly what he thinks about them, has a very low opinion of the human race, and prefers the company of his dog. Then suddenly, his predictions about the incoming planet are all proven correct, and everyone needs him and pays attention to him again. He has the answers to save the world, but hardly cares, as he finds the act of explaining things tiring - what finally brings him to the aid of mankind is the thirst for knowledge - he must know what is at the core of the incoming planet.

It's hardly Shakespeare, but there are elements of genius in the Benson character's dialog and actions, especially in the scene when he demands control of the entire space force in exchange for his help. Benson comes across as this sad, mad, tragic figure, and IMO, he saves the movie from being just another b-grade sci-fi. I'd go so far as to say I wish there were a remake just so I could see a modern actor assay the role against a backdrop of spiffy FX and contemporized dialog.",1393286400,7,2073,4.365284974093265
8200085,1,B000REQTA4,"What a heavy handed, hack script! This is one cheesy movie with characters that are made of cardboard. I finally couldn't stand it about halfway through, so I just ended the torture, and I'm glad I did.",1392681600,,202,4.486486486486487
8200086,4,B000REQTA4,"In the opening minutes of BATTLE OF THE WORLDS, we find ourselves bombarded by some of the worst movie theme music ever conceived! a female voice warbles, and dissonant horns blare at odd intervals! If that's not horrible enough, we also discover that a rogue planet known as ""The Outsider"" is headed toward the Earth! An ancient Claude Rains (THE WOLFMAN, THE INVISIBLE MAN) plays a crabby professor w/ a penchant for gardening, who could be our only hope. Panic sweeps the globe, resulting in mass suicides and riots. Contrary to all known evidence, the professor believes that ""The Outsider"" will miss our planet. Oh no! ""The Outsider"" has gone into orbit around the Earth! This means that this doomsday planet is under the control of some alien intelligence! A ship is sent to investigate, but is quickly attacked and destroyed by a squadron of flying saucers from ""The Outsider""! The professor realizes that the eeevil orb will continue to tighten its orbit until it causes a global catastrophe! Will our world's leaders listen to the professor before it's too late? While not the best sci-fi movie ever made, BOTW is good, and its unique storyline is never boring. Well worth watching...",1377388800,,1193,4.910891089108911
8200087,3,B000REQTA4,"How did Claude Rains lower himself to do this film?
The only English speaker in the film along with some good looking Italians.
Loud dialogue, Interesting premise, But glad when the finale came and Claude was put out of his misery.",1373587200,,231,4.658536585365853
8200088,2,B000REQTA4,"This is a 1963 Italian sci-fi film. A planet from outside the galaxy has been seen in our solar system and is headed for earth. Only the obstinate Dr. Benson can save us because he know calculus. The picture takes place in the future where we have bases on Mars.

The acting was bad as the film lacked any decent dialouge. The special effects were cardboard space craft on a string. This is a color film but doesn't hesitate to use black and white stock footage of natural disasters. The film lacked the camp value to make it a good ""bad film"" to watch. It was interesting to see their vision of our future. There are better and ""badder"" old sci-fi films out there.",1369612800,,665,4.362903225806452
8200089,3,B000REQTA4,"I saw this as a kid and remember it being spooky and mysterious and full of rockets and flying saucers and something I never thought of before ......Artificial planets being used as space arks. The concept is great and certainly original for the time. The story:
A large planet  wanders into the solar system and many scientist believe its trajectory may put it on a collision course with earth. One Astrophysicist ""Dr. Benson"" has calculated that the intruder will miss the Earth by 90,000 miles. Everyone is grateful that the planet does indeed miss the Earth but..... instead of bypassing the Earth it slows down and changes course and goes into orbit around the Earth. Dr. Benson realizes that only one thing can explain this and it does not bode well for Earth. There are some interesting twists and turns and this is not your average Earth VS the Aliens flick. Also Benson is played by Claude Raines. That's the good . Now For the bad: The production values are low even for the time. Most of the characters are cardboard and so is most of the acting. Many of the sub-plots and dialogue are ludicrous. This is a movie that could have been great with a good director and decent actors and some Money!!! If only Ray Harryhausen or George Pal or Irving Block had done this!!! Oh well. Worth the watch at least once particularly if you like late 50's early 60's Sci-Fi. Rent it Don't buy it.",1368576000,4,1393,4.572
8200090,3,B000REQTA4,"Battle of the World was not the movie I thought it was, other wise a watchable if not drawn out movie.
You would need to love the old classics and have and be will to watch the whole move to find out what is all about.
No problem play this oh my blueray either.",1355616000,,261,3.8518518518518516
