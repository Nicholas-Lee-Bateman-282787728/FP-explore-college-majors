8571087,5,B00BMUL6P0,"Even if the title might promise quite a bit of sleaze, this film features anything but, instead being an in a weird way rather touching human drama that might come across intentionally blunt at times, even disgusting (again, intentionally so), but it does feature a compelling story with plenty of heart and soul - and quite a bit of suspense, as this is no feelgood drama but a film about a wife-beater, and it's directed accordingly as a thriller rather than a tearjerker or something ... and everything does work out, this is a rather interesting and quite unusual piece of low budget cinema that really deserves quite a bit of attention!",1422403200,,641,4.732142857142857
8571088,5,B00BMUL6P0,"Sex, Lies and Depravity starts off with a reflective account of two friends enjoying happier times. This helps to set the foundation of the problems that are highlighted through this film by the main character of Jake. In many ways, this is true for all of us to some degree, as a persons deepest problems can be traced back to key points in their childhood.

 It is with this in mind that you can begin to understand why Jake is suffering from repressed personality traits and depression and his unhappiness of where he is with his life situation and the longing for his old friendship with Aaran.

 Once you understand why Jake is depressed, the domestic violence you encounter as the viewer becomes less shocking, but even more heart-breaking as you become involved as you watch, simply because you understand why. As part of Jakes story is told in flashbacks you can understand how physical and mental abuse can perpetuate, from one generation to another, even when you hope that it does not.

 Is it any wonder that virtually all of the characters take solace from sex, drugs and alcohol, but these highs are only ever fleeting, shallow and ultimately self-destructive. But even here, there is a small, flickering light of hope, as one of the secondary characters, Kyle, had a beautifully, healthy and constructive escape. To find out what though, you're going to have to watch the film.
 The other central character of Ethan, I found was the most honest and realistically grounded member of the cast. He made do to survive, as we all do and he knew how to survive. However, what made Ethan different, was that he knew how to communication and through all of the bravado you heard him come out with, he also actually cared about the people around him. You will, most definitely find Ethans language, colourful.

 I won't say any more about the film, as I would start top give things away. But after the first ten minutes you can see how this will end. Its just like being locked into a Roller-coaster, you can see where you are heading, but there is absolutely nothing that you can do about it.

 In many ways, the style of this film, with the faded colour, gives you the impression that everything is filmed underneath a giant shadow. Depression can and does leave you feeling this way and the whole film captures that perfectly.

 Overall, this film ends with hope and that life does indeed, carry on. If you like Indie films, that does not have the false, showbiz glitz of Hollywood, then this is the film for you.",1413244800,,2522,4.653153153153153
8571089,3,B00BMUL6P0,"Firstly, there may be some Americans confused by the british accents and language in the film. This can't be helped. Other than the few detracting sound clips (to be expected in an independent), this film is beautiful in it's own dark and heartwrenching way.
Performances to look out for from Leigh Sorrell, Natascha Sauer and Wade Radford. Whose portrayal of violence, pain and anguish is only overshadowed by the evident sexual chemistry between the two male leads.

Watch this film if you like sex, drugs and brutal violence. .. And young british flesh.",1378425600,2,556,4.978494623655914
8571090,1,B00BMUL6P0,"Sex Lies & Depravity was filmed in 10 days, and it shows. Originally named 'Jake' in the UK, but changed to sell more DVD's across the pond in the USA.

I think this was a day in the life of some tri-sexual little children playing adults in or around Bedford England. The writing is horrible, the acting is atrocious, the sound quality is a joke and the lighting is below amateur and set on horrible sound stages with shadows all over. This movie is bloody awful. The decent underground soundtrack is the best thing I can say about this English excuse for an indy, otherwise its complete bollocks.

The annoying thing is all the high ratings on IMDB and Amazon clearly written by the people involved with the movie. I'm only posting this review to save my fellow movie addicts time and money. Punt this movie into the trash like David Beckham. Don't watch this or you will be sorry!",1377648000,4,882,4.50625
8571091,5,B00BMUL6P0,"That should have been the title of this hard-hitting, sad and shocking tale. Need, need is what drives the characters of this story - the needs of Jake, in particular, whom is the catalyst which leads the train to its shocking end. Jake's need for a mother, his friendship with Aaren and the love he feels for Ethan but is ashamed to admit. These people are not depraved, that would suggest they were somehow WRONG or crazy. That is not the case. These are normal people driven by compulsions into insane conditions and for Jake, those compulsions lead him to commit some of the most heinous acts out of revenge and self-loathing.

I also noticed in the credits that the Ethan character is the same guy who wrote, produced, edited and directed this masterpiece. My hats off to him. He did an amazing job for someone wearing so many hats and with the budget he had. Sure there were some places the writing could have used some brushing up, such as the ending. I wasn't crazy about the way Ethan apparently just walked away in the end and goes back to Kyle's place. What about Hannah? Why not call the police or something? Aside from that, good job. I look forward to seeing more of this guys work.",1376784000,2,1196,4.486238532110092
8571092,5,B00BMUL6P0,"At turns heart wrenching, shocking, humorous...well, this pretty much explored the whole gamut. It's kind of an emotional roller coaster, but a very good movie & very well acted.",1374969600,3,178,5.172413793103448
8571093,5,B00BMUL6P0,This is the new breed of indie movies as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to give away to much but suffice to say there are some bold moves here. Great concept and execution.,1374710400,,176,4.057142857142857
8571094,4,B00BMUL6P0,"This wasn't what I was expecting, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. For the most part you only see indie movies that cover some of the the subject matter here. Support the good stuff.",1362700800,2,178,4.424242424242424
