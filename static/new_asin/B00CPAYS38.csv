8584435,3,B00CPAYS38,Fun to watch some of the selected old time country artists.  It is as advertised a small selection of cuts out of the Reunion Show.  Bill Anderson and Larry Black introduce the segments being shown. They provide some interesting stories.,1529884800,,237,4.9
8584436,5,B00CPAYS38,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He LOVES it!  He loves it so much, I will probably be buying more country family reunion dvds in the future.  In fact, I have bought a few already, but this one set seems to be his favorite!  I believe it was used, but it is in very good condition - can't tell it isn't new!!!",1524787200,,324,3.9384615384615387
