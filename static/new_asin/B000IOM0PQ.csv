2659216,5,B000IOM0PQ,"I ordered this DVD for my husband for a gift.  He has always loved her as a comedian.  We saw her and her DVD advertised on Jay Leno early this year.  I was only able to find this DVD on Amazon.com.  High quality, quick shipping, average price. Thanks.",1173312000,5,252,4.1875
2659217,4,B000IOM0PQ,This shows how much of a professional Phyllis Diller is.  She controls all of her act to make the audience really enjoy her performance.  What a trooper!!,1170979200,5,154,4.666666666666667
2659218,5,B000IOM0PQ,"An excellent documentary of the best female comedian of our time.  Certainly the best of the 20th century!!  Well filmed, with great interviews from her peers.  The special features are wonderful with a full uninterrupted version of her final performance.  Truly Wonderful!!",1169596800,8,274,5.4523809523809526
2659219,5,B000IOM0PQ,"Even though I am still actively stalking Phyllis Diller to this very day, my association with her goes back to 1971. People always ask me, ""Is she really that funny in person too?"" Is she EVER! Unlike many comedians, like Jerry Lewis for instance, who was often actually quite morose offstage, Phyllis was and is a genuinely funny lady. In the 1980s I shot a feature on Phyllis for the Los Angeles Times Sunday HOME magazine, and spent the entire day at her home in Brentwood. Because prepping the shots took up most of my time, Phyllis would keep bouncing into whatever room I was setting up to shoot in, or the yard, to check on me, feed me, bring me something to drink, and always make some wonderfully off-the-wall comment or joke that made my work that day a luxury. Even though I have worked as a photographer for, and with, approximately 200 celebrities, Phyllis remains one of the people I can count on one hand who treated me with warmth, kindness, and inclusion. We photographers are basically a throw-away, interchangeable commodiity in Hollywood, but Phyllis has always treated me with respect and regard. And I love her for it. And you'll love this DVD!",1168387200,33,1166,4.665048543689321
2659220,5,B000IOM0PQ,"In 2002, the 84 year-old legendary comedian Phyllis Diller decided to retire from doing stand-up comedy. But never retire altogether! As her son Perry says in the documentary, ""We never use the R word in mother's house. She will never retire. She'll always be working at something."" Today Diller continues to make appearances in films and on tv and continues to paint, another of her many talents. ""Goodnight, We Love You"" provides the viewer with a glimpse into Diller's private and public life and shows what a consummate professional and caring and giving person she truly is.

This wonderful documentary follows Diller as she prepares for her final appearance in Las Vegas. We see her arriving at the hotel, inspecting her rooms, rehearsing, applying her make-up, wig and costume, and her 5-minute ""quiet time"" that she demands before every performance. It is a grueling routine and Diller is a perfectionist and pro when it comes to the set-up of her stage, lighting and sound. We also get a glimpse inside her beautiful Brentwood home which includes rooms for her wigs and costumes. She also shows off one of her many antique automobiles and her red kitchen, where she often prepares gourmet meals. Her home office contains huge filing cabinets where thousands of her jokes (all of which she wrote!) have been filed, cross-referenced and organized.

Throughout the documentary, comments are provided by fellow comedians such as Don Rickles, Lily Tomlin, David Brenner, Bonnie Hunt and others as well as people who have worked with Diller through the years like her personal secretaries (who were given the name ""Dustbuters""), agents, etc.

Extras on the dvd include her full 43-minute final performance in Las Vegas, a question and answer session with Diller and director Gregg Barson and a ""Dustbiter Reunion,"" where Diller meets up with many of her former secretaries.",1165536000,38,1876,5.084415584415584
2659221,5,B000IOM0PQ,"This is a very nice documentary on the legendary comic, Phyllis Diller. The focus is on her final stand up performances. But we learn so much about her and the people that have been a part of her life. Much better than an A&E biography. I didn't know she was a painter.

The bonus is you get one of her final shows uncut.

This is must viewing for anyone who enjoyed her.",1165276800,34,371,4.138888888888889

2659223,5,B000IOM0PQ,I love Phyllis Diller - she was a class act.  And she had an an amazing work ethic and she certainly brought smiles to others.  Great video.  Great lady.  She is missed.,1418601600,,169,4.1875
2659224,5,B000IOM0PQ,"This documentary is about Phyllis Diller as she prepares/performs her last performance. I was in awe of what a brilliant and creative person she was here. She talks about a couple times where she was in the right place at the right time and how those moments changed her life. She designed her own clothes, shoes, hat boxes. She talks about things that are really important in life which you may not notice the first time through (I have watched this twice now). She was a perfectionist - she believed in doing her very best and so interesting it was to see how she prepares for the show and how she lived her life. She was one of the all-time great ones. She tells her jokes from her last performance throughout the documentary which breaks it up and keeps the whole thing light. Well done!",1417478400,2,791,4.462068965517242

2659227,5,B000IOM0PQ,"Goodnight, We Love You - The Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller  -- Ah Phyllis..... I grew up with her and tried to watch everything I could find on TV.  I never saw a live show and was saddened when she passed. RIP.
This is a great memory for this lady.  It gives some interesting looks, mostly centered around her last appearance at back stage, on stage and around stage with some peeks during her career.  you will even get to meet the ""DustBiters"".  You get a peek at what this lady was about and it fired some very fond memories.
If you liked Phyllis Diller then you will want your own copy for your memories.
I highly recommend.",1406678400,,633,4.285714285714286

2659229,5,B000IOM0PQ,She made us laugh so hard. This was not long enough for me. I wanted more after it was done. She started the housewife jokes and was awesome. Then she got into the getting older jokes. We loved her.,1404000000,,198,4.102564102564102
2659230,5,B000IOM0PQ,"This product arrived fine.  I'm happy to be able to have had the opportunity to catch a unique, funny, queen of comedy to add to my collection.

2659232,5,B000IOM0PQ,A classic.  The quality of the print is poor with uneven vocal quality.  The content is fascinating; I would hope that Americans take notice of the value of the comedy and entertainment in our culture that comes from individual effort.,1396224000,,235,4.85
2659233,5,B000IOM0PQ,"A real riot. As usual, she is hilarious. Her humor is so corny and that is what makes her so funny. I had the priviledge of meeting her and getting her bookk on ""Housekeeping Hints"" autographed. It is priceless. Great comedian. I was saddened When I heard we had lost her.",1388016000,,272,4.352941176470588
2659234,5,B000IOM0PQ,I wish there were more videos of her.  She was an amazing woman.....I think she got better with age.  She was in her 80s I believe when she did her last performance.  Truly a dynamic woman.,1380240000,,189,4.194444444444445

2659238,5,B000IOM0PQ,"Even at her last live show Phyllis Diller still has the machine gun delivery of one liners ! So funny you can gasp for breath laughing. Truly the Queen of comedy. A great DVD, you will know Miss Diller much better after viewing  this. Fans will love this. Many celebrities such as Ann Miller comment on how marvelous Phyllis Diller really is as a person and performer.",1363392000,,368,4.492537313432836

2659240,5,B000IOM0PQ,"It's Phyllis Diller there is no way you can go wrong! The only thing to do is put the DVD on sit back and LAUGH! Watching this made me think of seeing her while I was growing up, brought back such good memories.

2659243,3,B000IOM0PQ,"This would have made a good 30 minute documentary. The repetitive clips of Ms. Diller onstage got tedious, as did some of the personal anecdotes. I enjoyed it but stopped watching after a while.",1346284800,,194,4.735294117647059
2659244,5,B000IOM0PQ,"I've always loved Phyllis Diller.  I grew up watching her on TV and always wished to see her in person, though that never happened.  This video is a real treasure.

2659245,3,B000IOM0PQ,"If you're a Phyllis Diller fan, then this film is certainly worth watching.  But honestly. . . I found it to be a bit sad.  I think I would prefer to see her simply preform onstage rather than all of the ""background stuff"".",1345334400,,223,4.162790697674419
2659246,5,B000IOM0PQ,"I bought this for my mother who used to work with Phyllis Diller during Diller's copyright days at Kahn's Department Store in Oakland, CA.  The DVD didn't go much into that part of her life, but it was a gem of a documentary about her life and her career. I used to do a little stand-up comedy so this would be good for anyone thinking about getting into the business.",1342569600,,368,4.257142857142857
2659247,4,B000IOM0PQ,"Watching Phyllis discuss her work ethic and comedy in general makes you feel lack an underachiever no matter what your chosen profession.  Phyllis is incredibly prolific and it's great to see her open up about her decades in the business.  The stakes were never particularly high and certain moments seemed subdued, but it was lovely to follow her towards the tail end of her expansive career for 90 minutes.  Truly lovely.",1323820800,2,423,4.929577464788732
2659248,4,B000IOM0PQ,"Love Love Love Phyllis Diller.  Miss her also.  That whole era of television.  I grew up watching Phyllis, Red Skelton, Don Deloise, Smuthers Brothers etc and it was a time of real comedy.  No swearing, cussing, talking about private parts etc.  There aren't many comedians out there today that can match Phyllis Diller!",1317600000,2,320,4.962264150943396
2659249,3,B000IOM0PQ,"Goodnight, We Love You: 5 out of 10: This collection of Phyllis Diller sex tapes is somewhat disappointing. Often filmed in that awful night vision green it is hard to make out the action. In addition, Miss Diller rarely takes on more than one man at a time (except for the Catalina Island orgy) and her only lesbian scene (with Elaine Boosler) is all to brief.

Phyllis of course was a famous sex kitten who had myriad affairs with such luminaries as Troy Donahue and Anwar Sadat. In fact, Sadat's last words 'Phyllis it was always you' is often misquoted... okay okay I kid I kid

Fans of Phyllis Diller will be pleased... Fans of elderly woman checking into moderate hotel suites will be in heaven. Goodnight, We Love you does beg a few questions. The primarily one is should you allow your stalker to film your biography. To describe director Gregg Barson as fawning is to completely underestimate his obsequious servitude towards Miss Diller. Honestly, it is more than a bit creepy.

Not that celebrities interviewed are any less ingratiating. Not one expresses surprise that Diller is still alive and the kind words flow as if they were giving an encomium rather than personal insights. I understand that is human nature to say something nice but after the twentieth or so collection of hosannas, Don Rickles' sneering come across as a breath of fresh air rather than the senile rambling it actually is.

In fact, Rickles' own recent documentary 'Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project' would make a nice companion piece for this film

Diller's Guinness Book awarding rapid-fire delivery is well covered here and a reunion of her personal assistants is the highlight of the film. I wish there was more of the personal stories and less generic celebrity praising. There is also not enough actual stand-up in the film itself as a result the companion disk of her last live performance is a welcome addition.

A nice enough film for Diller fans but one should check their blood sugar levels before watching.",1258675200,3,2007,4.802898550724637
2659250,5,B000IOM0PQ,"I have been a fan of Madame Diller's for a long time.  I had seen the A&E Biography, and I've read her book (""Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse"" which is excellent by the way).  So I bought this expecting a nice little DVD.

I was quite surprised at the depth.  This film is truly great.  It mixes footage leading up to and including her last stage show before retiring from stand-up.  This was great, but also interspersed was interviews with Phyllis Diller, friends, and associates.  There is also a fairly in-depth tour of her home: her clothes, her painting, her office, the gag file, etc.

One of the most delightful things for me was the interviews with the ""Dustbiters.""  They were Madame Diller's traveling secretaries over the years (most apparently only lasted on the gruelling life of touring for a couple of years).  It is a true testament to the person that she is that they all have come together with only warm and loving things to say.  Her son Perry Diller also provides his thoughts as well.

The bonus features are great too.  There is footage from a Q&A with the director and Madame Diller after a showing of the film at some festival that lasts about 10 minutes.  It is entertaining as well as interesting.  Also included is a chat with a ""Dustbiter"" from the 1980's who was not with the other Dustbiters in the film.  The films trailer is also included, but by far the best bonus feature is the complete performance of Madame Diller's farewell show.  A lot of it is seen throughout the film, but it is really great to watch it in its entirety.

This is a must-have for any fan of Phyllis Diller, but it is also a great buy for people who love to laugh.  I laughed a lot watching it!",1205107200,6,1703,4.435483870967742
2659251,5,B000IOM0PQ,This movie is a must for anyone who enjoys stand up comedy. Ms. Diller is the Godmother of standup. The film captures her rise to stardom in a man's world. She stayed on top of her game because she kept up with the times. I recomend this film to everyone.,1175385600,5,255,4.12
