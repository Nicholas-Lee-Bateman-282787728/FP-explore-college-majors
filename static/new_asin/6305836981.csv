7897213,3,6305836981,"This movie is good. I remember it from when i was younger. Its about a wanna be writer and a wanna be dancer named Lola. The guy sees her dance and can't get her out of his head so he looks for her (but the catch is when she danced she was wearing a mask). He eventually finds her (even though he doesn't realize its the woman he's been looking for until the end). They become quick friends and he tells her how he lied to his parents by telling them he was rich and had a girlfriend. So she agrees to pretend to be his girlfriend and let him borrow her house so he can look rich, all the while she is lying to him because she's really a housekeeper that is house sitting. They basically get caught in a bunch of lies while unintentionally falling in love. It is a very funny and romantic story!!",1237680000,6,796,4.076433121019108

7897215,1,6305836981,Do not waste your time with this movie. The plot is predictably and silly. Remind me of those college movies. The dance is poor and not worth any praise. I had trouble not sleeping through it.,1090195200,3,192,4.361111111111111
