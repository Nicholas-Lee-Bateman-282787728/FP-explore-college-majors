8221248,1,B000W4T9B0,"The concept, background research and photography were good.  The voice recording is dreadful!  The narrator speaks way too fast and his pronunciation is abysmal!!  I don't expect that he would pronounce names precisely as a native would, but he was so far off that we could not  understand what places he was talking about. Painful to listen to.  Very very poorly done.",1384992000,,369,4.887096774193548
8221249,4,B000W4T9B0,"This is a very useful and informative video for both the first time or frequent visitor to Estonia.  There is enough useful and historic information to be interesting but not in not such large portions to create n information overload.

This DVD is to be recommended to anyone with any interest in Estonia.",1226448000,,306,4.754716981132075
