How amazon lets this person do what he is doing is appaling.  The filthy language (although censored) he uses in his music reviews is not necessary, and in no way is it even possible for him to garner the vote count he has.  Look at his rank.

Look at his rank.

Then look at his total number of votes, and just compare them to the other reviews around him.  It is obvious whats going on.  Sad and pathetic.  As a newcomer to Amazon I find this distasteful to say the least.  His account as well as all his reviews should be removed.

1676800,5,B00005YU7H,"Just like I said, out of our usual world.  Is it really like that under the water.  The Blue Planet team not just filmed it, but brought it to life for all those of us who don't spend their lives under the sea.  Excellent script, perfect photography, flawless sound mixing, magical music.  A multiple thumbs up.",1023753600,6,311,4.5

7957096,5,B00005YU7H,"So much of our lives depend on the ocean. It's worth getting to know it better, even if just by watching a video. This is a beautiful and informative video. We watched it so many times, we wore the old one out, and I had to purchase another copy. Totally worth the expense. Plus, you get David Attenborough. I want him to adopt me.",1395446400,,331,4.1875

7957101,5,B00005YU7H,"This planet of ours continues to amaze me with each new episode I watch.  I had already seen Planet Earth which influenced me to buy the Blue Planet.  From common everyday fish to monsters a science fiction writer couldn't come up with on his best day, The Blue Planet amazes and keeps me in awe of what a diverse and beautiful planet we have.  When I see the variety and bounty of the ocean, and our planet, I know there is a God.  None of this wonder could be an accident.  It also makes me angry that we all squander our wealth with no thought to the future generations who will not have the beauty we do.  When its gone, we won't get a second chance!",1215907200,,654,4.150793650793651
