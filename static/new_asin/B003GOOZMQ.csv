4123399,4,B003GOOZMQ,"In the realm of date movies and sex comedies I think this flick has a place. First off I think it merges the two concepts. It is a date movie with with sex comedy jokes. Krysten Ritter is hot and solid in the show, the supporting characters are funny and the music is decent. The dinner table scene with the family is a gut splitter and who would like to get sex advice from Jenna Jameson.",1278633600,2,389,4.131578947368421
4123400,5,B003GOOZMQ,"After I saw this movie at a screening, I literally told all of my friends about this movie. I can't wait for all of them to see it! The actors are so funny, you'll nearly pee yourself. Don't let ""romantic comedy"" throw you off, it's for sure NOT a chick flick! Hey boys, wanna learn How to REALLY Make Love To A Woman? This movie has all of the answers you need :-)

Already pre-ordered it to put in my comedy collection!",1277337600,3,421,4.134146341463414
4123401,5,B003GOOZMQ,"What a cool film - one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in years.  Its basically a story about one couple's journey to understand what each other needs in a relationship, and the quirky turns they go through to get to the truth.  I loved Josh Meyers in the lead male role, and Kristen Ritter really showed her dramatic muscle as his girlfriend.  And there was solid chemistry between them both, which made the story all the more credible.  Oh, and let's not forget Ken Jeong and Jenna Jameson's characters - off the charts funny!  Great date movie!",1276041600,5,555,4.565656565656566
4123402,5,B003GOOZMQ,"I went to go watch this at my school in Cal State San Bernardino because they were offering a free screening.
I fell in LOVE with the movie and how everything was put together. It was amazing. I definitely look forward to any future sequels that this film may have. I hope that word about the movie spreads out as fast as it can because it was great.",1275436800,4,350,4.161764705882353
4123403,5,B003GOOZMQ,"I caught this at a film festival in LA and was so surprised at how funny it was!  I love Ken Jeong from The Hangover, and he did not disappoint!  Krysten Ritter was also really great.  This would be a fun movie to watch with a date!",1275436800,3,232,3.893617021276596
4123409,4,B003GOOZMQ,"The movie is good. The only reason why I bought this movie is that I love Ian Somerhold.
It had it's funny parts but not really a guy movie, more of a chick flick.",1372464000,,163,3.823529411764706
4123410,2,B003GOOZMQ,this movie was cute and funny but moved slow and was not all that entertaining to watch for more than 30 minutes.,1363564800,,113,4.181818181818182
4123411,4,B003GOOZMQ,"Very funny movie.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Actually had decent tips too lol.  Lots of actors and actresses i know, including Krysten Ritter, who's hilarious on The bitch in apt. 23.",1354233600,,186,4.935483870967742
4123412,4,B003GOOZMQ,Watched this movie in order to see Ian Somerhalder. I was a bit sad that he did not have a bigger part. He does well with the part he does have though. I enjoyed this movie and I am glad I bought it. Funny and very full of laughs. Give it a look.,1344211200,,246,3.660377358490566
4123413,4,B003GOOZMQ,"I didn't expect to, but I really enjoyed this movie! MUCH much better than 30-year old virgin! (That was just pathetic to me - this was actually funny)

Characters Andy & Lauren are a fun couple who have been dating for about a year. Andy could be ""the one"" but there are a few issues...for example, he never heard his dad tell his mom he loved her so Andy never says it to Lauren (even though he seriously loves her and is thinking about popping the question), and on top of it the sex just isn't that great as he fails to ""get her train to Orlando"".  Lauren is the typical woman who suffers in silence so Andy is clueless about this until he gets the big (unsatisfied) ""sigh"" from her after they do it on their 1-yr anniversary.  This makes him worried about getting benched, so he brings up the problem with a friend and basically it gets blabbed all over the place and he gets different advice (some good, some not) - but it's done in such a fun/funny way (good comedy).

He already thinks he's going to lose her, and then she gets offered a fantastic promotion (that would relocate her to Chicago) and a handsome guy appears on the scene and Andy panics and pretty much does everything wrong pushing her away when what he most wants is to hold her tight and never let her go...

The characters are fun/interesting, the situation is realistic -- the girls will be going ""uh huh"" through the whole movie, and the guys will too, but they might just learn a thing or two along the way -- with plenty of funny moments for both genders and all ages!

It's not a mushy romantic comedy that you'd want to watch while cuddled up together -- this would be a good movie for a group of people to watch together and laugh over.",1337385600,,1719,4.306501547987616
4123414,4,B003GOOZMQ,In a nutshell this movie is just trying to tell men that most women need to be turned on in their minds before the bodies; and their probably goin to need what and where the clitoris is....lol.,1315699200,,193,4.243243243243243
4123415,1,B003GOOZMQ,"I deceided to rent this movie after reading all the good reviews, and seeing that Ian Somerhalder was in it. But, I was thouroughly disappointed after watching it. It brings nothing new to be seen and is even quite tame in most respects... Boring movie. Also, I've never found myself actually rooting against the main character... He was so annoying and whiney in that clueless sort of way through the entire movie, I just wanted him to fail... Fail miserably.",1295568000,,460,4.7625
4123416,4,B003GOOZMQ,"Well let me just say that I more than ADORE Ian Somerhalder...it was not enough of him in this movie but it was still quite interesting...I kinda feel as if Andy didn't not deserve to get the girl, he was selfish and sometimes cruel because he had low-self-esteem...I mean you went out with the chick for a whole year and she never ""got to go florida"" that's selfish...but the film was pretty good none the less..I mean it's worth watching :)",1293494400,,442,4.469135802469136
4123417,5,B003GOOZMQ,"I got the movie a few days ago and just got around to watching it.  I thought it was great!  I never thought of Josh Meyers as a ""lead role"" kind of guy, but this movie definitely proves he can pull it off.  The scene with his little brother made me laugh and feel very uncomfortable at the same time...very fuuny!  I'm telling all my friends to buy this movie.",1280361600,,361,4.114285714285714
4123418,4,B003GOOZMQ,"I watched this last night and laughed through most of the movie. I say ""most"" because there are some serious moments. Josh Meyer is definately an underappreciated actor and they justify this fact in the ""behind the scenes"". This is another pearl of this movie. The extra features are excellent.
Cameos by up and coming music artists in the movie are well acted as well and will surprise you when you find out who they are. One example is Ronnie Winter. I kept telling myself, "" I know that name. Where do I know it?"" He is from Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. They did that song, ""Face down"".
One of the funniest cameos is by Jenna Jameson. It was a short cameo but I kept laughing at her performance and additional interview in the extras menu.
Just look at the stars on the cover and you can see how good it can be.
The only negative is the rare moments in serious scenes where the tempo kind of drags you down. Also, the awful clothing design. I kept saying, ""What are they wearing and who needs to get fired?"" The attempts to be trendy just came off as poor fashion sense.
Well worth the watch though since fashion sense is a very small negative.",1279065600,4,1142,4.366197183098592
8396507,3,B003GOOZMQ,Fun B-list movie. Got it because my girlfriend is kinda head over heels over Ian Somerhalder(credited as starring) but he's only briefly in it a few times. Kinda let down there. Whatever. Still fun to watch.,1526256000,,207,4.777777777777778
8396508,3,B003GOOZMQ,"this is nothing that we haven't seen before. Guy thinks he is a sexual dynamo and actually pleasing his girlfriend when he suddenly realizes that he isn't. he goes and looks up his best friend and then they go and get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. Josh Meyers is the guy in question and I seem to remember him for That 70's show, towards the end of the run. Anyway were there some pretty funny bits, yes there were. did it take a very odd serious turn? It did. As I said this is nothing we have not ever seen before. Would I recommend it? I will say yes because there were some things in it that were different.",1484006400,,627,4.105691056910569
8396509,3,B003GOOZMQ,"It was ok....nothing spectacular at all, except for Ian Somerhalder (who, incedently, was the ONLY reason I bought the movie) who was gorgeous & wonderful as usual!!!",1441497600,,166,5.185185185185185
8396510,4,B003GOOZMQ,"Good movie, I liked, pretty funny.",1437609600,,34,4.833333333333333
8396511,2,B003GOOZMQ,The acting was painful to watch.,1419984000,,32,4.5
8396512,2,B003GOOZMQ,"Sry a real snooze, not worth watching.",1406419200,,38,4.571428571428571
8396513,5,B003GOOZMQ,I went on Amazon and found every Ian Somerhalder film I could find and bought them for my daughter who's a big fan.  I did check them all out to make sure they played and they all did.  My daughter is happy with all of them. All were shipped in a timely manner.,1393286400,,261,3.9056603773584904
8396514,3,B003GOOZMQ,"At least it was suitable for region 4, unlike the Rules of Attraction DVD you sent me and I had to return , at greater expense than the original purchase....",1390867200,,157,4.266666666666667
8396515,3,B003GOOZMQ,"How to make love to a woman was an ok movie, I expected to see Ian Somerhalder a lot more, was funny, probably wouldn't buy it",1381449600,,126,3.8846153846153846
8396516,5,B003GOOZMQ,I like it but this movie is not for everyone.  Lots mature content!  Ian Somerhalder is great but doesn't have a big part.,1379635200,,122,4.260869565217392
