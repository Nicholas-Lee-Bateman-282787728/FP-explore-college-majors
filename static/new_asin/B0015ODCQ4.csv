8259253,5,B0015ODCQ4,"This particular version of these two great Tod Slaughter vehicles (including his signature role) is the genuine article. They are easily the finest looking Region 1 prints that I have seen and it's doubtful that they will ever be bettered unless Tod becomes a hot commodity which is highly unlikely in this day and age. It would also seem unlikely that Rockabilly musician / actor / wrestling manager Johnny Legend would be a fan of Tod Slaughter (if you've never heard of Legend, google him) but I, for one, am grateful as he went to lot a trouble to run down these prints, clean them up, and then make them available for us (a special feature on the DVD has Johnny L. telling you all about it). Avoid all others especially the public domain Alpha Videos. Older B & W movies need to be presented in the best prints possible if there's any hope of getting a 21st century audience to hang with them.

Tod Slaughter (1885-1956) was an English actor who specialized in portraying Victorian ""You must pay the rent"" type villains. Think of him as Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price combined! He's that subtle. Most of the movies he made in the late 1930s and early 40s were film adaptations of his many traveling stage shows which played all over England especially in the small towns. SWEENEY TODD has gained latter day notoriety because of the Sondheim musical and the Tim Burton movie with Johnny Depp but this is the story more or less as the Victorians knew it from the ""penny dreadfuls"". It is also bound to disappoint today's jaded sensibilities as British censorship restrictions in the 1930s made sure that the story of the mad barber and his accomplice Mrs Lovett turning customers into meat pies would be heavily watered down (even from the stage show). Still, it has its moments.

While I only became acquainted with SWEENEY TODD after college, I knew the story of CRIMES AT THE DARK HOUSE from before high school. It's a stage adaptation of one my favorite 19th century authors, Wilkie Collins. The novel is THE WOMAN IN WHITE (Collins' THE MOONSTONE is even better) which is chock full of atmosphere and all sorts of mysterious goings on. This adaptation is full throttle melodrama with Slaughter pulling out all the stops as Sir Percival Glyde who is the major villain in this version not Count Fosco. Although it's common outside of England to dismiss 1930s British cinema, I have always had a fondness for the ""pictures"" as the Brits like to call them. Tod Slaughter and English movies aren't for everyone but if you love the latter then you'll thoroughly enjoy the former. Just make sure it's the Johnny Legend edition. Accept no substitutes. FYI: The image on the DVD is from THE FACE AT THE WINDOW which is in Volume 2.",1412294400,2,2729,4.659751037344399
8259254,5,B0015ODCQ4,"While ""Sweeney Todd"" is considered the definitive Slaughter film and is superior to the musicals I found ""Crimes at the Dark House"" to be even better.  Both films are dominated by Slaughter, but the supporting casts do a fine job too.  ""Sweeney Todd"" is a murdering barber who disposes of bodies with the help of his neighbor the piemaker. The film is fairly faithful to the book, though at times the subplot involving the young sailor slows down the fun and a modern day framing sequence with a barber narrating the story served was not needed at all.  ""Crimes at the Dark House"" is loosely based on Wilkie Collins' ""The Woman in White"" and is more enjoyable than the lengthy novel.  Here Sir Percival Glyde is the villain and Count Fosco a secondary character with the background changed to make Glyde an imposter rather than illegitimate.  The rest of the story remains the same, he marries for money, substitutes his wife for a dying madwoman she resembles in order to inherit, kills a blackmailer, and meets his end in a similar manner to the book.  Slaughter's performances in both films is exactly what the roles required, Todd and Glyde are men without consciences and were played as the villains they were.  Slaughter did not come off as outdated or excessively melodramatic, he came off as someone who know both what the parts required and what the audience wanted.",1352505600,2,1375,4.7521008403361344
8259255,5,B0015ODCQ4,"I had always avoided Todd Slaughter films due to the gruesome covers dripping in gore. Boy was I wrong! They are marvelous, very like Val Lewton films. Done with a tiny budget and unknown cast they more than hold their own. It's wonderful to see an accomplished actor like Todd do his stuff. The perfect melodrama villain, he plays with skill and panache. A different style from today but very much of it's time. We have only seen ""But you must pay the rent!"" hammy villains, Slaughter is the real deal. Sweeney Todd stays fairly faithful to the original story (which can be read on project gutenberg)and Crimes at the Dark House is a very good version of Wilkie Collins The Woman In White.
Thank you Johnny Legend for putting out these films of Slaughter with quality prints. I am collecting them all.",1268092800,3,802,4.615384615384615
8259256,5,B0015ODCQ4,"The Great Johnny Legend has presented two classic Tod Slaughter features, SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET and CRIMES AT THE DARK HOUSE.  The first is a classic story that has its origin in a ""penny dreadful""(or penny number, referring to 19th century British fiction publications, usually lurid serial stories appearing in parts over a number of weeks, each part costing a penny) entitled THE STRING OF PEARLS: A ROMANCE written by either James Malcom Rymer or Thomas Peckett Prest(the same two to whom was attributed VARNEY THE VAMPIRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD) and later dramatized into a play entitled THE STRING OF PEARLS by George Dibden Pitt.  The second is based on the classic epistolary mystery novel by the famed author Wilkie Collins entitled THE WOMAN IN WHITE.  SWEENEY TODD has been dramatized and filmed many times by such actors as G.A. Baughan(1926; lost film), Moore Marriott(1928; silent film), Tod Slaughter's version(1936), Mavor Moore(1947; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio play), John Miranda(1970; Andy Milligan's film BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS), Freddie Jones(1970; part of the MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION ITV T.V. Series), Barry Morse(1973; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation T.V. Series THE PURPLE PLAYHOUSE), Len Cariou, later replaced by George Hearn(1979-82; Stephen Sondheim & Hugh Wheeler's Muscial Thriller), Ben Kingsley(1998; British Sky Broadcasting T.V. Movie), Ray Winstone(2006; BBC Television Drama), Johnny Depp(2007; Tim Burton's Musical Film).  Tod Slaughter gives the BEST performance out of all of these other versions, and I may be prejudiced, but no one could ""polish off""(a term used in SWEENEY TODD to refer to both clean-shaving a client or slitting their throat!) a potential victim as Tod could, with his unctuous, leering, crocodilian-smiling manner, rubbing his hands together and chuckling most macabrely as he winks to the audience to come and join him in his devilish fun!  Likewise in CRIMES AT THE DARK HOUSE, Tod completely dominates the story, even ""polishing off"" his cohort Count Fosco(played by Hay Petrie) in a twist from the story which has Count Fosco as the prime mover.  Whether driving a spike into a sleeping prospector in Australia's ear and assuming his identity as the false Sir Percival Glyde, throttling lovely damsels or old beldams with ""So You Wanted To Be A Bride, My Dear, I'll Make You A Bride, The Bride of Death!!!! Hah hah hah hah hah!!!!!""  Tod is colpletely in his element, slitting throats for ""fun & profit"" as the redoubtable Sweeney Todd, terrorizing his young barber's assistant Tobias and supplying his henchwoman Mr. Lovatt(Stella Rho) with the ""material""(i.e., human flesh from the corpses of the victims) to make her ""delicious"" meat pies!!!!! Nobody could upstage Tod, he is an unsung hero in the annals of cult and horror cinema who has been sadly neglected by fans and DVD companies alike!  All we have had access to until now have been scratchy, jumpy, poor quality ZIV T.V. prints on such labels like Alpha Video, the cheapie outfit.  Now, finally, with the auspices and hard work of the Great Johnny Legend, we can enjoy Tod's capers as they were meant to be seen, in beuatiful pristine prints which Mr. Legend has worked long and hard to acquire and present as a labor of love to Tod's fans everywhere.  Tod Slaughter(Norman Carter Slaughter) may have been a HAM, but he was a SUCCULENT HAM of the FIRST WATER, right up there with Robert Newton(ARRRRRRRRR, MATEY!!!!!), Charles Laughton(THIS IS MUTINY, MR. CHRISTIAN!!!!!) and other cinematic greats.  I, and others and only hope there will be more of Tod's films coming from Johnny Legend's skilled expertise, including THE CRIMES OF STEPHEN HAWKE, THE FACE AT THE WINDOW, THE TICKET OF LEAVE MAN, THE CURSE OF THE WRAYDONS, NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND, MARIA MARTEN OR THE MURDER IN THE RED BARN, etc.  A FIVE-STAR product, I recommend it without reservations!",1226361600,7,3922,5.159055118110237
