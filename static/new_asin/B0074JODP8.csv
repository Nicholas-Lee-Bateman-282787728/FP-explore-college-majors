I suggest you get the set so that you can get the whole package.,1434499200,,264,3.8181818181818183
5054175,4,B0074JODP8,"Joe never leaves anything on the table.
This is my favorite Bonamassa. More blues and less rock.
The next to last cut ""I'll take care of you"" with Beth Hart is as close to guitar sex as you can get in public.
Joe is wailing and bending notes, Beth is writhing and feeling the music.
Phew! I need a shower.
Seriously, I wish she did every song. Her and Joe are quite a team.

I never heard of either until the Kennedy Center Honors of Buddy Guy.
Beth Hart sang an Etta James song, with Jeff Beck on guitar. It brought the house down.
I thought she was the reincarnation of Janis Joplin and Etta James.
I think that one song changed her career. I looked her up on YouTube and found her with this player
Joe Bonamassa, and thought, ""Oh, my god, where has he been?""

Now, I have 5 or 6 DVD's with Joe. I like the old blues stuff. This is good, so is Red Rocks (Muddy Wolf).
Joe started playing at age 4 and at 12 went on tour with BB King. Even then, he could wail.

I gave it 4 stars, not because of quality, but I'd like more of Beth.",1433635200,3,1032,4.0

John Hiatt and Beth Hart are also superb guests.

5054231,5,B0074JODP8,"Joe consistently blows everyone else out of the water. He is so good on so many levels. His playing is impeccable,while at the same time displays a level of adeptness unparalleled. The years he spent practicing have given him a sense of timing, and a sense of knowing which notes to hit at which time, which is pure  genius. It is a real treat to watch him play, especially when he is unleashed within the structure of any song he is using as a vehicle for his mastery. People might make fun of Joe for wearing the suits, the glasses and a youthful awkwardness when it comes to relating with his audience in any other way than through his guitar, but I find it even more endearing. This is THE master of the blues without the  ""Rock Star"" persona. To be honest, I don't know how he survived Black Country Communion, and its attendant egos. Thanks Joe for being so great, and so authentic. You converted me into one of your true fans. This concert is stripped down with  perfect backing from bass, organ and drums as accompaniment. I was disappointed with the Joe and Beth live in Amsterdam concert. This more than makes up for that. This is Joe for his fans.",1402272000,,1158,4.427230046948357
5054232,4,B0074JODP8,Joe puts on a great show and I really enjoyed his special guests that came out to play with him...outstanding!!,1400716800,,111,4.6
5054233,5,B0074JODP8,"I really enjoy putting a concert on the home theater system with the surround sound. It makes for a great escape. I have between 60 & 70 ""concert"" DVD's. Joe Bonamassa has become one of my favorites to put on & this concert is Awesome. He is one of the greatest guitar players out there ((how can anyone pick a #1 with all the different styles of players) and this concert shows how truly amazing he is. If you are into Joe Bonamassa, I highly recommend this DVD as well as his ""Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House"".They are must haves. All his shows are fantastic & you would not be disappointed in any of them. That being said, if you are not aware of this man and want one DVD to own & show off, you can't go wrong with either, but in the end, you need to have him playing the electric guitar. I would suggest this one. You play it a few times, you'll want the Acoustic as well & will NOT be disappointed in either.",1400457600,,925,4.144444444444445
5054234,5,B0074JODP8,He is absolutely amazing. Love just chilling to this and him or even cleaning house .  This is Just awesome,1399248000,,107,4.35
5054235,5,B0074JODP8,"If you don't know Joe, this is as good a place as any to start. I probably prefer the RAH show slightly, but not by much. Great set list, and great guests. John Hiatt is amazing, and Paul Rogers sounds exactly like he did 30-40 years ago. Joe's playing is so refined and almost perfect, but there is still feeling and emotion in it.

It could be easy after a while to dismiss new things from Joe as just ""okay"", because of how prolific he is and because of the high level of excellence expected of him. But taken release by release, not measured against my own ""favorite"" or ""best"" opinion of other recordings...this is definitely a 5 star.

If you like blues/blues rock, this guy is the best on the planet. Great band, great songs, great execution. So good.",1397779200,,758,4.4071428571428575

If you like Guitar Driven Rock, Blues, Blues Rock, Jazz - all from a very young guy who not only writes his lyrics but also his music and it's actually good - you want this. This guy is the most under-rated musician you have never heard of. When you hear this (hopefully through real speakers - not amped up bass boosters from hell)  you will hear music - like it's the first time. I accidentally found him and bought 2 CDs.
Then I went to a used CD shop and bought the rest of his entire catalog (new & unopened) including the 2 CDs with Beth Hart and his first rock band's CD and his other pet project Rock Candy Funk Party. Then I found the DVD concerts and then the blu rays concerts. I'm tellin' you ""Get up off-a that thing"".........and buy ALL OF IT. You WILL thank me.....",1384732800,,870,4.178571428571429

Anyone who thinks this disc in, either Dolby Digital Or Master HD, sounds good DROP YOUR IPODS THIS INSTANT AND GO LISTEN TO SOME DISCS FORM THE LATE 80'S EARLY 90'S. on a system with some dynamics. This disc sounds weak. NO DYNAMICS AT ALL. ZERO. Who mixes this crap ? Members of his son's fifth grade av club? I was hoping His Black Country Communion , Live over Europe was a fluke. Unfortunately no. He just has incompetent production. Anyone hear his albums? Are they as anemic as his concert discs? These are recorded in DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO??????  B.S. the music in the menu sounds better than any of the performances on either disc. If your a fan than by all means pick this up. He is a very fun guitarist and I like the way he sings. also the songs with Beth Hart sound better than the rest of the disc...Hmmmm...wonder why...",1380931200,,962,4.497142857142857

5054347,5,B0074JODP8,"Strong performance from a strong performer. He reminds me of Gary Moore (whose ""Midnight Blues"" is tastefully covered on this DVD), Clapton and Kossoff. His guitar playing and singing remains powerful and inspiring. His guest singers (including Paul Rodgers from Free/Bad Company, Beth Hart-his part time collaborator, and John Hiatt- whose songs he often covers).

5054351,5,B0074JODP8,"Here is Joe Bonamassa at his best, performing with a great backup band and some impressive guests. The sound recording quality is excellent, and the audio appears in all its glory on the Master Audio track of the blu-ray disc. At the high end, the cymbals sizzle, and at the low end, the bass guitar is clear and musical and can be felt as well as heard. It takes three things to make a great concert video: the performance, the recording, and the video. The first two are so good I almost forgot to watch the video, but that's superb too. Everything came together fabulously here. A must-have concert video.",1375747200,,608,4.536363636363636

5054468,5,B0074JODP8,Was extremely happy to find Paul Rodgers and  a few other great performers on this DVD. Great production and sound quality.,1357171200,,123,4.857142857142857
5054469,5,B0074JODP8,"This DVD is almost as good as sitting on stage for the show! The sound is amazing and the video crystal clear.  I've seen Joe live, 20 rows away, and this DVD rivals my experience.",1357084800,,180,4.142857142857143
5054470,3,B0074JODP8,"3 stars is a little harsh - but I only gave the Royal Albert Hall one 4 stars and I liked it better than this, so I've got to go one less.  Why?  Like on RAH, the guests were a total distraction.  Unlike some reviewers here, I really do not care for Ms Hart's vocal stylings.  My negative reaction to her is nearly as strong as my deep disappointment with Glenn Hughes & the BCC sound.  Hiatt and Rodgers were like the guests on RAH - old greats that just don't hold a candle anymore to the stratospheric Mr Bonamassa.

Fortunately, it's a nice full program and so you can skip past the guests and still feel like you got your money's worth.  Joe and the boys are really very good - worthy of the many 5 star reviews here.  Bergman is the only lineup change from the group I saw perform live - and a fine addition.  I especially liked Blue and Evil, since that was the highlight for me on Black Rock.  I was delighted that Joe dug into the old catalogue and pulled out The River, because I missed him playing that one when I saw him.

But that tees up my recommendation.  RAH is better than this for the musical selections but the DVD you should really get is the old Rockpalast one.  Joe really shines in that more intimate club setting and you can see why he deserved the recognition that enabled him to move on and play the grande venues.",1356998400,2,1341,4.19140625

5054554,4,B0074JODP8,"I'd rate this performance 95, and the Albert Hall performance 105.  For the price it's worth having both.  If you're just going to buy one, buy the Albert Hall performance.

5054559,5,B0074JODP8,Joe B. is the best in the world. Buy this dvd and find out. If you are a guitar rock/R&B fan is does not get any better than Joe Bonamassa.,1352764800,,139,3.6666666666666665
5054560,5,B0074JODP8,I fell in love with Joe Bonamassa's riveting blues sound when I stumbled upon this concert on PBS one Saturday night.  He plays with such power and sweetness at the same time.  It's the new sound in my car wherever I'm going.,1350864000,,225,4.333333333333333
5054561,3,B0074JODP8,Joe is very talented. Love his music .have every album he has out. This record is wonderful except for the way it was recorded. Sounds to me like its analog. Very dissapointed. By now he should also be concentrating on the quality of his music. I love it when a record has a professional sound. Please JOE DO IT RIGHT.,1350518400,,318,4.316666666666666
5054582,5,B0074JODP8,Seen him on TV one night and loved his music and style. I could watch this one over and over. Great music! Plays spectacular guitar and sings great. I would recommend this one to all!,1350086400,,183,4.257142857142857
5054583,1,B0074JODP8,"Joe does not have a ""blues"" voice.  It is pitched too high.  A person is born with good vocal quality, but not Joe.  Rick Melick the keyboard player is useless, especially the lame Hammond solo on ""Better Watch Yourself"".  Rick should look at other Hammond organ players such as Chester Thompson, Lucky Peterson etc. The drummer is a rock drummer, wears gloves, what up with that?  Bass player is OK.  Don't buy this dvd, check out The Phantom Blues Band, dvd live with Taj Mahal in St. Lucia.",1350000000,4,493,4.545454545454546
5054584,5,B0074JODP8,"I won't pretend to be an expert, but I know good music  when I hear it, and this performance is fan-fing-tastic from beginning to end.  Joe Bonamassa is an incredible musician and vocalist, and has surrounded himself with the best people.  This band is so in sync, and you can tell they are loving every second of it.  Old fans will love it, and I hope new fans will discover this rare talent...this performance is a great way to start!  For those who care, the production value is fantastic.  The director and crew deserve major kudos for a production that is so clearly well planned and expertly executed.  The lingering shots of Joe's hands are exactly what you want to see...you could almost believe that Steadicam was invented with Joe's hands in mind.  Everything about this disc is top-notch.  You won't be disappointed!",1348704000,,827,4.7272727272727275
5054585,5,B0074JODP8,"I read, ""Joe did play two shows at the Beacon. Footage from both shows, mostly Saturday, was used for the DVD. First song up is Slow Train.  With two minutes to midnight playing in the background, the stage goes black. The train is coming! Joe rips into Slow Train. Next song Joe plays is Cradle Rock."" Rory Gallagher would be proud.

17 songs later you let your breath out as you can't remember if you had taken one since the concert started. And that pretty much sums up how I feel every time I play or watch a new offering by Mr. JB.

You grip your lazy boy chair and launch into the second DVD which contains more great tunes plus two bonus songs, ""If Heartaches Were Nickels"" and ""Woke Up Dreaming."" Bonus footage on the DVD includes Joe and David Crosby together with David wowing Joe with an acoustic guitar session. Great back stage pictures, photos, and back stage footage.

Guests include Beth Hart, The Paul Rogers and John Hiatt along with his formidable bandmates Carmine Rojas, Tal Bergman, and Rick Melick.

""Beth Hart joins Bonamassa on stage for soulful duets on I'll Take Care of You and Sinner's Prayer, which is featured on the recently released Don't Explain - an album of soul covers Hart recorded with Bonamassa."" She has such a smoky sensuous style that keeps you gripping tightly on your seat.

""John Hiatt, a Nashville Music Lifetime Achievement Award recipient and American Music Award (AMA) winner, joins Bonamassa for a rendition of Down Around My Place and I Know A Place."" John's near perfect performance highlights the amazing guitar work playing along side.

""As legendary classic rock singer Paul Rodgers (Bad Company, Free) hits the stage, the audience jumped to its feet as Bonamassa performed Fire And Water and Walk In My Shadows."" Two classic frontmen, and distinct voices presenting flawless blues rock at its finest.

A magical couple evenings at the Beacon resulting in some of the most memorable performances by Joe and his guests. Joe never falters or misses a beat,his instinct as a performer is uncanny. He always puts together a winning production.",1348272000,3,2095,4.8
5054586,5,B0074JODP8,the music was great.the sound was great.this is the first dvd by joe that i have seen.i plan to listen to many more.,1347840000,,116,4.086956521739131
5054587,5,B0074JODP8,"This great 2011 concert follows Bonamassa's last recorded event at Royal Albert Hall in 2009.  This time out, he cuts out the horns, the extra drummer, etc. and goes for a 4 man group.  He and they are great.  I didn't notice any common songs, except for his outstanding acoustic ""Woke Up Dreaming"" which once again finds its way to the ""Bonus"" section of the disc.

Helping Joe out with some vocals are blues belter Beth Hart, folk rocker John Hiatt and from Bad Company and recently Queen, Paul Rodgers.  Each does a couple numbers with Joe torching the strings in the background.  The stellar band is certainly worth mentioning with Carmine Rojas on electric bass, Tal Bergman on drums and Rick Melick on keyboards.  By my count Joe uses 8 different guitars on the 18 songs including a vintage 1959 ""Les Paul.""

Like his previous Blu ray/DVD the concert is directed by Scot McFadyen who does another masterful job.  Unlike most concert films these days, the transitions are smooth and stay focused on what is important at that place in the song.  Editing is well done.  Lighting is appropriate for the venue.  Excellent production which comes across in the Blu ray.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is well presented across the channels. There is also a LPCM stereo and a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 mix.  Crank it up and enjoy one of the great guitar masters of our day.",1347235200,6,1379,4.621399176954733
5054588,4,B0074JODP8,"Disc number one of this release had a really strange flaw: depending on how I accessed the cuts, sometimes there would be no audio. It was like the audio file just didn't load correctly or something. At any rate, there was no problem in returning the DVD, but because it was from a private seller, I couldn't get an automatic replacement. I did get credited for purchase, but because to get it replaced, I would have had to order from the same dealer, I opted instead to buy directly from Bonamassa's site.
Great DVD, great performances though.",1346889600,,544,4.618556701030927

Bonamassa is not an extraordinary blues guitarist, not an extraordinary rock guitarist, not an extraordinary jazz guitarist - he's just extraordinary. He plays and sings the blues in a way that makes you feel it in your gut and in your head, and Joe's surrounded himself with a top-rank trio of musicians who complement and enhance his dynamic performance. Wrapped up in exemplary production, this DVD is superb. So darken the room, don your headphones, keep your eyes open, and press Play...",1346803200,,594,5.01010101010101

5054593,5,B0074JODP8,"It is a real shame that the ""mainstream music"" stream is dominated by generic AOR where folks like the Jonas Brothers and whatever manufactured group-of-the-day ""band"" are viewed as ""musicians""  I have played the guitar for about 30 years all around the world and can't listen to the ""Mix/Hot/Hits"" radio stations anymore due to the lack of innovation, overuse of sampling and copycat lyrics.  Joe Bonamassa blows every other guitar player out there today away.  This DVD was my real intro to Joe and I am now hooked. I can't wait to see him when he comes to DC this fall.  Buy this DVD and you will NOT be disappointed.",1346198400,,620,4.609090909090909
5054594,3,B0074JODP8,"Joe is a talented guitarist and if you like musical fusion, then Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theatre is for you. The reason I purchased this DVD was because I really liked his CD with Beth Hart, but had I realized his solo performances combined so many styles of music, I wouldn't have bought it.  He's obviously good on each song, but his music wasn't distinct enough for my untrained ear to fully appreciate.",1346112000,5,403,4.597222222222222
5054595,5,B0074JODP8,"Honestly I believe that every adjective known to ""Webster"" has been used for this talented Guitar and Blues lover.  They all are correct.  Joe Bonamassa's talent knows no end.  Now that the CD will be available he's even more accessible.  When he plays, he and the guitar are ONE.  When he sings, he's in his own world.  I thoroughly love every piece in this set.  My favorite has to be ""Blue and Evil"", with ""Dust Bowl"" a close second.  If you haven't heard this man you are missing out on pure Heaven.
This DVD set is worth the price, although seeing him in person would be a treat.
Until I can sell a kidney to get the money for a ticket, I'll just watch him on my TV and enjoy him whenever I want.",1345852800,,701,4.17910447761194

I miss the dual drummers they are a better fit than Tal he is to much glitz style of "" Metal Drummers "" and doesn't fit Joe's style. I think Joe tried something to be a little different than his Great Usual Style and it fell short of my satisfaction.

John Hyatt is superb guest guitarist, especially on a number called ""Down Around My Place."" Tal Bergman is fabulous on drums . Beth Hart is a guest blues singer on two songs and really belts 'em out. This concert ran as a fundraiser for public TV in Philadelphia. I donated to station AND bought the DVD set.

What am amazing talent. I am not easily impressed, having come from a classical background, myself.  But, I happened across this performance on PBS and was absolutely overwhelmed.  He is a phenomenal talent - true genius. The interview with him also revealed a man of great humility and generosity of spirit.  Not a bad combination.  I hate it that terms like ""genius"" and ""artist"" are used so loosely, indiscriminately, and irreverently these days.  He truly deserves them. I hope that I am able to see him perform in person some day. I will be stocking up on his music, in any form, as much as possible.",1340582400,,779,4.568345323741007

5054607,5,B0074JODP8,"Let me start by saying that I had (along with my girlfriend) the opportunity to see this amazing band playing live in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on June 2nd (a forever memorable Saturday night). The concert we saw was, in fact, heavier than the one recorded for this DVD, as there were neither special participations (hey, nothing wrong with that), nor acoustic songs. What we had, as a special treat, was a drum solo by this great drummer (I got a drum stick for my collection).
Just to give you an idea, he played stunning versions of ""Song Of Yesterday"" (from the first BCC album) and ""Sloe Gin"".
About the DVD, I don't want to sound repetitive, so I recommend you read some previous five stars reviews let by other costumers, which are all complete and/or detailed reviews. That said, stop wasting your time and find yourself a way of bringing this wonderful concert to your home. You won't regret it!
About Joe (from whom I got a guitar pick for my collection), he is the best ""guitar character"" that appeared in the music business in the last ten years. I hope he will know how to deal with all the compliments he is receiving recently (all deserved, I must say!). We don't want to lose you, JOE! YOU'RE THE MAN!",1340236800,,1210,4.504545454545455
5054608,2,B0074JODP8,"Joe is obviously an excellent musician, his guitar pyrotechnics are only matched by a very few.  That said, I expected much, much more from this DVD than I got.  First, the audio was slightly muddy, an inexcusable happening with the technology available today.  Then the video was fuzzy and colors washed in strange ways, probably because of stage lights, so I'd give that one except I've seen many with colored lights on stage that didn't mess up the video.  Finally, Joe himself.  When he sticks to the guitar, he's fantastic, but you can't watch a couple hours of that without songs attached.  There are about 3-5 good songs on this DVD, and 2 of those are by his guests!  His vocals are slurred, muffed, and unfathomable.  The songs themselves, other than the handful mentioned, are just plain boring. If he'd hire a songwriter and a singer, he'd be much better off.",1339200000,2,870,4.71523178807947

5054612,5,B0074JODP8,"Joe Bonamassa is among our greatest living guitar players. And you may not know who he is. Such is the peril of the blues. The difference in units sold between the No. 1 album on the pop charts vs. the blues charts can be in the hundreds of thousands. As a blues mainstay, five of his 12 albums have debuted at No. 1 and seven have reached the top spot.  The 34- year old West Hartford, NY native regularly opened for B.B. King as a teenager.  He has since sold out London's Royal Albert Hall and shared the stage with the likes of Clapton, John Hiatt and Paul Rogers. The fact that blues players are primarily featured in guitar magazines full of technical jargon and equipment features make them further inaccessible to the mainstream. Nonetheless, Bonamassa's brilliant under the radar career has been defined by a tireless work ethic and the simple passion for making music in the most puritanical sense. He mainly plays small venues and cuts albums whose sole criterion is to produce his best work every time. Some are destined to become blues classics.  As often as the term guitar hero is ascribed to him, pop culture antihero is also equally accurate. In a 2011 American Blues Scene Interview, when  asked why he wasn't featured on the Rolling Stone Top 100  guitar players of all-time list, he replied, ""Have you seen who's on the cover this week?(It was Snooki) Rolling Stone has about as much credibility as The National Enquirer.""  The only time he was ever mentioned in a mainstream music magazine was in an issue of SPIN, when he took out a full page ad to promote his tour. The terms ""blues titan"" and ""the next Stevie Ray"" have not unfairly been ascribed to him. His newest album, ""Driving Towards the Daylight"" (out May 22) is a balanced back-to-basics album that highlights Bonamassa's signature style of roots blues with rock-and-roll guts, while honoring the traditions of the original blues musicians. ""We've taken some really traditional old blues songs and we've tried to imagine how they would be done in a rock context,"" said producer Kevin Shirley. ""It's a very exciting return to the blues in a very visceral way. It's vibrant and it's gutsy and it's really, really rugged."" Special guests Brad Whitford (Aerosmith guitarist), drummer Anton Fig  and Carmine Rojas pulling bass duty. Initial reactions from rock critics have been overwhelmingly favorable and  suggest that Bonamassa will likely become a crossover star with this latest effort. It was once rumored that at Live Aid, Clapton said to Mark Knopfler, ""I think we're in trouble,"" after seeing Stevie Ray play.  After hearing Bonamassa, it is easy to see how that very statement might be repeated. He is that good.",1336521600,,2700,4.814254859611231
5054613,5,B0074JODP8,"After being pretty disappointed with Joe's recent CD with Beth Hart, I was elated to be knocked out by this DVD! Joe and his band and special guests are firing on all cylinders throughout! The only track I wasn't too excited about when I saw the listing is Mountain Time, as that tune has appeared on just about every one of his concert videos, if not all of them completely. It's a good song, but...it would have been nice to have some seemingly forgotten gems of his instead, like Pain and Sorrow from his So It's Like That CD...GREAT SONG! Hendrix would be proud! Why can't we have a treat like that on DVD, Joe??

But...no huge deal...minor gripe. Joe's playing is phenomenal in this concert, and he sports not one, but TWO '59 Les Pauls!! Dang...most of us mortals could never find, let alone even coming close to affording, one! The greatest electric guitar in existence, hands down, and Joe shows us why on this video...THE TONE! Nothing so sweet have you ever heard! I don't know what he paid for those babies, but I'm sure he feels they were worth every penny! I'm envious, of course, but if one person in this world deserves to have two '59's, Joe is it!

Beth Hart does a great job on her selections, and John Hiatt was fantastic...great voice, and a legendary songwriter! Paul Rodgers...out of this world! Singing just as well as he did over 40 years ago, and looking youthful and fit!

If Heartaches Were Nickels was a real treat, as that is a great song, and I was disappointed that he didn't sing a complete version of it on his Live From Nowhere CD. He makes up for it here by churning out a scorching electric version of it on the bonus disc of extras!!

I thought Joe's Royal Albert Hall video, while still very good, was not as great as his Rockpalast DVD, but this Beacon DVD is right up there with the Rockpalast disc, for me!  An indispensable addition to the collection of any Joe B. or blues rock fan!!",1336521600,2,1926,4.429378531073446
5054614,5,B0074JODP8,"This guy is phenomenal. The best guitar player out there and he has a great singing voice. The best! Highly recommend this DVD/Blue Ray.
I highly recommend any and all of Joe Bonamassa's music. It is all great and well worth the money. Great Blues Rock.",1336176000,,253,4.521739130434782
5054615,4,B0074JODP8,"It's fairly unbelieveable that there are 28 five star reviews as of writing this.  Obviously there are a LOT of die hard Bonaholics who are writing these reviews (which is great).  The only reason I lowered my rating to four stars, is that in comparing this to his Royal Albert Hall DVD, it diminished the importance.  Here are some pros and cons;

Pros;

The Gary Moore cover was a great choice, especially at the time of it's recording.
The new drummer is great, and maybe a little better than the former one.
""If Heartaches Were Nickels"" was finally performed on a DVD.
The special guests are amazing, especially John Hiatt.
The snippet about Joe playing in the subway was great.

Cons;

Not that I don't like the songs, but why put ""Mountain Time"" AND ""Woke Up Dreaming"" on ANOTHER DVD?  They are very long songs, and I really didn't think it was an asset to add the same 20 minutes of songs that we heard on the Royal Albert Hall DVD.

The second DVD was really unnecessary, because if you eliminated the above mentioned songs, you could have surely added the bonus features to the first disc, and lowered the price of the DVD.

The featurette with David Crosby was very boring, and no disrespect to Crosby, but Joe looks completely bored during the whole ""interaction.""  It seemed to me like a situation in everyday life when you are talking to someone you are bored with, and just keep saying ""yes"" and ""ok"" in hopes that the conversation will soon end.  Does Crosby really think Joe needs hints on playing guitar?  I just didn't find this interesting at all.

So for all the people who couldn't imagine that I gave this four stars, please calm down.  I liked this DVD a lot, and would tell anyone to buy it.  But, for those die hard fans who have everything Joe has released, I have already gotten tired of two DVDs with a few of the same songs on them.  Why does Joe always tend to skip material from his first few albums?  At least the BCC DVD ""Live Over Europe"" had a wide range of songs.",1336089600,6,1999,4.4301369863013695

5054617,5,B0074JODP8,"I read a recent review of Joe Bonamassa and this person said that Joe should stick to other song writers' material!  Are you out of your mind?  I hope Joe pays no attention to some of these reviewers and sticks to his own agenda which seems to be creating more and more beautiful, creative, ever-expanding musical styles and sounds.  In particular, ""Slow Train"" and ""Dust Bowl"" have the earmark of Joe's ever growing creative work.  I, for one, am hooked for the long haul and look forward to where Joe will be going next.  It's blues and beyond--wherever you want to lead us, Joe!  The experience with Joe's music is new for me.  It's been mesmerizing!  Love you, Joe!

5054620,5,B0074JODP8,"It is amazing how just a short time ago I really didn't know who Joe Bonamassa was. Thanks to the PBS special of the Beacon concert, I learned that the art of guitar playing had reached new heights. How can I say this? I have been playing for 50 years, been around some of the best, and thought I had heard the best. Suddenly this 30-year old wonder burst into my consciousness with a creativity, taste, and technical virtuosity not reflected by many. Many people would point to Stevie Ray, Jimmie Hendrix, Doc Watson, Raun MacKinnon, Jerry Miller, and other virtuosos who displayed these kinds of characteristics, but none of them except for him has gone further. Listen to the haunting modal solo where he simultaneously hits harmonic notes while moving the volume knob with his little pinky. Listen to his fabulous cross picking on a great Martin in the opening busking piece, and then later on, the fabulous flat and finger picking piece on an acoustic while on stage. Listen to his lovely singing. His accuracy and timing are impeccable, and the speed is not only Ferrari fast, but tastefully done so that each note is clear and purposeful. Listen to Slash, a Les Paul speed freak who wears you out with noise, not wise playing. Bonamassa owns hundreds of guitars, and uses each for selected songs. He is the new standard. Enjoy him while you can.",1334620800,3,1352,4.684873949579832

But after seeing him on a PBS special on a late Saturday spring night,i became an instant fan !!!
This guy is a GUITAR GOD ! He's way up there with all the greatest like SRV,Clapton,Hendrix,Page,Townshend or whoever you may think of.
Joe Bonamassa is definetely one of the greatest guitar player of all time no doubt about it.
His fingers are just like magic,not to mention his voice.
I can only imagine how it youl'd be to see and ear him play his stuff on a Stratocaster...
I still can't get over this concert as i was blown away big time by the sheer performance. Just the extras are worth the price. I mean WOW !!!
A jaw dropping piece of anthologie.
I don't know what to say more than maybe it should have gotten an Oscar for best movie of a concert an a Grammy for best concert filmed :-)

5054624,5,B0074JODP8,"Everyone involved with the production of Live at the Beacon should be proud. This DVD captures great performances with excellent picture, sound, directing and editing. Even the packaging, photography and design are special. This is yet another showcase of Joe Bonamassa's ever increasing skills as a guitar player, a vocalist and a collaborator.  Joe is becoming more sophisticated in his playing as time goes on and his vocals are superb - noticeably stronger than the early days of his career. It is clear that this band has great chemistry: Tal Bergman on drums, Carmine Rojas on bass and Rick Melick on keyboards. (I especially enjoyed Tal's bigger than life personality which was apparent even from behind the drum kit.) The set list is well balanced with some blistering blues rock (The River, Blue and Evil, Young Man Blues) as well as more quiet, nuanced and soulful songs (Midnight Blues, Bird on a Wire, Mountain Time, for example).

All of the guests are exceptional and each felt like a true collaboration - with time for the guest artist to shine as well as time for Joe to shine with his fantastic solos. It was obvious Joe brought in artists he very much respected and his desire to collaborate only makes him a better and more well-rounded artist. Paul Rodgers still has a great voice and it's nice to hear Joe play a couple of Free classics with him. John Hiatt is a wonderful song writer and I remember Joe stating earlier last year that Down Around My Place was his favorite song from Hiatt's release ""Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns."" It is a haunting and dark song and Joe's solo made it even better. Beth Hart's outstanding vocals and stage presence added a lot of energy and exuberance. Her beautiful vocals on I'll Take Care of You and her dirty strutting growl on Sinner's Prayer complimented Joe's playing so well. It is delightful to see such pure joy and appreciation of the other musicians on the stage just beaming from her. Very much looking forward to their future work together as their collaboration album ""Don't Explain"" is world-class.

Bonamassa is not just highly skilled but the emotion that he conveys with his playing is incredible. He pays tribute to his influences as well as honing his craft and his own personal style. He put together an amazing set list, an amazing band, brought in some stellar guests and put on a memorable show that I'm very glad to have on DVD to enjoy anytime. Highly recommended!",1333238400,,2447,4.752941176470588
5054625,5,B0074JODP8,"Okay, so here's the deal.  Boomerocity is such a HUGE Joe Bonamassa fan that, by all accounts, every review we post should just read, ""Love it. Buy it. Now!""  This review is no different.  So, die hard Bonamassa fans: I know that you're either not reading this or you are stopping now and ordering your copy.

For the rest of you, with Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theater Live From New York, the guitar prodigy knocks it out of the park yet again with a tremendous delivery of 21 tunes - 6 of them with a little help from his friends Beth Hart (I'll Take Care of You and Sinner's Prayer), John Hiatt (Down Around My Place  and I Know A Place), and Paul Rodgers (Fire and Water and Walk In My Shadow) and all of them great.

The DVD starts out with playing an acoustic guitar in a New York subway, trying to earn some money without much success.  No, I'm not joking with you. Can you imagine?

As the scene shifts to inside the beautiful and iconic Beacon Theater where the real show begins with an incredible deliver of Slow Train from Joe's latest CD, Bust Bowl. From the opening note on, you will be mesmerized.  Of course, the all-time Boomerocity favorite tune, Mountain Time, is performed on this DVD - this time with a great little blues riff added towards the end of the solo.  I imagine guitarists the world over will be mimicking that lick (or try to) as a result.

On the two disc DVD set I received, the second disc (all on the same blu-ray disc) has two bonus tunes (If Heartaches Were Nickels and Woke Up Dreaming) as well as a behind-the-scenes look at Joe visiting with a very legendary artist who shares a tuning secret.  Guitarists will want to purchase this just to watch two greats share notes.

The guest spots are all really good.  John Hiatt was especially good.

There is not a need for a wordy review here.  Concert is superb.  Extras are very nice.  Another awesome performance from Bonamassa and his spot on band.  Just go ahead and order it.  If you have the capability for the DTS Master HD Audio....get the BluRay!",1333152000,4,687,4.586776859504132

Right up there with and somewhat better than TOTO's ""Falling in Line"". It's noticeable how much better Joe's phrasing has become with experience and how his musical counterparts blend with him. It's amazing how clean his playing is yet has all the feel of a journeyed guitarist.

Song set is good, much different than the RAH show. My favorites are still his standbys like ""Dust Bowl"" and ""Mountain Time"". The guest slots are good although I'm not impressed with Beth Hart. A lot of her time on stage was spent just moving around without singing. I can't help but think how well Susan Tedeschi's voice and playing would be a better fit.

Solid drumming but hey, lose the scowl. Sorry but I'd rather see Jason Bonham on skins. Heavier feel. Pay attention to Carmine's bass playing. I can't think of anyone else who would compliment Joe better.

A wonderful tribute to Gary Moore with ""Midnight Blues"". Listen to Gary and the Midnight Blues Band playing at the Montreaux Festival a few years ago. His version of ""Midnight Blues"" will melt you.

Hopefully Joe might find time to tour with Black Country Communion again. An awesome show and dvd too!!!",1333152000,2,1299,4.76

* ""Cradle Rock."" Wow. brought back memories of the ""Irish Tour"" LP.
* Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues."" Hair-raising cover of this recently departed guitarist.
* ""Walk In My Shadows."" One of my faves from ""Live from Absolutely Nowhere."" Cool to hear Paul Rodgers sing it. He still looks pretty good for 62.

If you like this guy this will blow you away. Heck...every musician or any one with a lick of musical sense should pick this up. Yeah it's that good. I have several dozen concert Blu Rays ...(and 100 or more DVD's)...in my ever growing collection and this is now in the top 3. Porcupine Tree's Anesthetize, Rush's R30, Peter Gabriel's Growing Up, David Gilmour's Albert Hall and Toto's Falling in Between would be the other great ones so far. This is better than his Royal Albert Hall Blu Ray. (which is great too)

Here's the basics. Set list is great. Picture quality is great. DTS Master 5.1 is AWESOME on a good system. Band is tight. Venue is great. Guest artist great. None of the artsy fartsy distortion or quick 1 and 2 second cut and pans of Black Country's or other Blu Rays. Every one is showcased as needed for a proper amount of time.

 The Sound quality is spectacular in DTS Master Audio! You can clearly hear every note being played at all times from all the band members, what struck me was the drums being so sharp and having very good punch and snap. Excellent micing and mix, hats off to the sound engineer guys, one of the best I've heard.

  The opening is JB playing acoustic guitar in the NY subway and then jumps to the Beacon Theater where Joe struts his stuff.
His rendition of Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" is to die for, the best version I've heard. Check out the guitar he uses on ""Bird on A Wire"" watch how it changes color and patterns. JB never ceases to amaze me, he might be one of the best musicians (not just guitar players) alive today. I think what makes him so enjoyable to keep listening to is he plays a different guitar on every song. Each of those guitars have a different sound and he makes them work, sound wise, with each song so the sound is not fatiguing.

Beth Heart is worth the price alone on ""I'll Take Care Of You"". Paul Rogers was impressive, he might even sound better now than he did with ""Free"" or ""Bad Company"". John Hiatt's section was very good also, ""Down Around My Place"", a typical Hiatt song, was extremely entertaining due to Joe's excellent guitar playing.

 With out hesitation this is a must have for anyone who collects Concert Video's, is a JB fan, a blues fan, etc... etc.... just get it you won't be disappointed! Now I'm just waiting for the new CD ""Driving Towards the Daylight"" where he goes back to basic blues tunes.

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVDs and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice.

5054635,5,B0074JODP8,"[Note: This review is of the two-disc standard DVD package, not the single-disc Blu-ray edition.]

On November 4-5, 2011, Joe Bonamassa and his current touring band, plus some special guests, played two shows at the legendary Beacon Theatre on Broadway and 74th Street in Manhattan, New York City.  This two-disc DVD set is a chronicle of those performances, similar to Bonamassa's popular Live From the Royal Albert Hall set issued in 2009.

It is no surprise that this DVD lives up to the high standards of its predecessor, since it featured the same brain trust (producer Kevin Shirley and director Scot McFadyen).  If anything, the more intimate Beacon allows for more closeups and camera angles than were possible at the Albert Hall.  Both the video and audio are top-shelf here, as is the packaging by Bonamassa's J&R Enterprises production company.

Disc One begins with a clever segment featuring Joe ""busking"" on a New York subway platform, then making his way on foot to the Beacon.  In a wry P.S. to his liner notes in the accompanying booklet, Joe says ""I was not able to make a single dollar busking in the subway on 72nd Street...Isn't it great to be back in New York!!!!""  Those lucky enough to attend one of the Beacon shows would say Joe's return was, indeed, great!

In what was a slight reversal from his set list earlier in the year, the concert itself opens with ""Slow Train,"" one of Joe's originals (co-written with producer Kevin Shirley) from his recent solo LP Dust Bowl, followed by his cover of Rory Gallagher's ""Cradle Rock"" (with a nice bit of slide work by Joe).  An awesome one-two punch, no matter the order.  Next up is Joe's own ""When the Fire Hits the Sea,"" a bouncy number from his 2010 LP Black Rock featuring some tasty honky-tonk piano from keyboardist Rick Melick.  Then the mood changes considerably when Joe pays tribute to the late Gary Moore with a beautiful and evocative rendering of Moore's ""Midnight Blues,"" masterfully played and sung.  The tempo changes again as Joe continues with his ""Dust Bowl"" and fan-favorite ""The River"" (co-written with Bob Held, from Joe's 2004 Had To Cry Today album).  On the latter, drummer Tal Bergman and bassist Carmine Rojas lay down a rock-solid, heavy groove, and Joe breaks out the slide again to excellent effect.

The evening's first ""special guest,"" vocalist Beth Hart, did a guest spot on Dust Bowl before releasing a well-received album of soul tunes in collaboration with Bonamassa (Don't Explain) in 2011, just a few weeks before the Beacon show.  Here, she tears into Brooke Benton's ""I'll Take Care of You"" and the Lloyd Glenn/Lowell Fulson classic ""Sinner's Prayer"" (with Joe's bluesy slide work complimenting Hart's singing beautifully).  If there is any justice, this DVD and Don't Explain should help Hart gain the wider audience her unique voice deserves.

After Hart's appearance, Joe kicks the tempo back into high gear with a rollicking version of Little Walter's ""You Better Watch Yourself,"" also from Dust Bowl.  This is followed by a couple of tunes from Black Rock, a cover of Bobby Parker's ""Steal Your Heart Away"" and a touching rendering of Leonard Cohen's ""Bird On a Wire"" that practically re-invents the song (with the help of Joe's Gigliotti Telecaster-style guitar).

Speaking of Cohen, an American musical treasure, the evening's second ""special guest"" is another of America's great singer-songwriters, the amazing John Hiatt. One of the highlights of the DVD is his collaboration with Joe on the haunting ""Down Around My Place.""  Unforgettable.  Their blues-rock rendition of Hiatt's ""I Know a Place"" (which Joe covered on Black Rock) is also a treat.

Following Hiatt's appearance, Joe and the band tear into Joe's original ""Blue and Evil,"" my favorite song on Black Rock.  Glad to see this one back on the set list, Joe!

The evening's final ""special guest"" had to have been special indeed for Bonamassa, since Paul Rodgers was lead singer for Free, one of Joe's favorite British blues-rock influences.  Rodgers' distinctive voice is in fine form on two Free classics, ""Walk in My Shadow"" and ""Fire and Water"" (Joe covered the former on his 2008 album Live From Nowhere in Particular).  Quite a treat watching Joe channel Paul Kossoff while sharing the stage with his hero's former bandmate.

Disc One concludes with the set-closer ""Mountain Time,"" another fan favorite for nearly a decade (it debuted on Joe's album So It's Like That in 2002), with an intro featuring a medley of the Bonamassa instrumentals ""India"" and ""Django.""  And then there's the encore, a blistering version of Mose Allison's ""Young Man Blues"" that gives The Who's rendition a run for its money.  Rojas and Bergman in particular have a blast on this one, and Joe makes splendid use of both necks on his ""Hotel California"" Gibson ES-1275.

Disc Two features two Bonus songs, a cover of Warren Haynes's plaintive ""If Heartaches Were Nickels"" and Joe's crowd-pleasing acoustic tour de force ""Woke Up Dreaming"" (co-written with Will Jennings, from Joe's 2003 album Blues Deluxe).  Also included is ""A Friend Stops By,"" an amusing backstage visit by David Crosby (who shows Joe a couple of tuning tricks), and ""A Busker's Tale,"" a tongue-in-cheek mini-documentary about Joe's busking adventure on the 72nd Street subway platform. Finally, there is a wonderful picture gallery (set to the studio version of ""You Better Watch Yourself"" and Joe's ""Black Lung Hearache,"" both from Dust Bowl), including shots of some other ""special guests"" (and guitars!) that didn't make it onto the DVD. Nice.

The package is not without some relatively minor flaws:  Rodgers' name is misspelled, for instance, and the list of guitars used omits the Ernie Ball Music Man Steve Morse model Joe uses on ""Mountain Time.""  More significantly, the booklet has ""Fire and Water"" and ""Walk in My Shadow"" reversed from the order they appear on the DVD.  Oops!

This well-produced package will prove a treat to long-time fans, and newcomers encountering Bonamassa's virtuosity and showmanship for the first time will find it hard to resist as well. It isn't easy these days to find a band focused more on the music than on the stage act, but Bonamassa, Melick, Rojas, and Bergman put out tight, excellent music with honesty and joy.  They're clearly enjoying themselves, and you will too. Highly recommended!",1332288000,55,6365,4.986754966887418
5054636,5,B0074JODP8,"Joe Bonamassa once more sets the blues/rock world on fire with the release of his new 'live' DVD... Joe Bonamassa: Beacon Theatre - Live From New York.  Recorded at the historic Beacon Theatre in New York during his current world tour, Tal Bergman is on Drums, Carmine Rojas plays Bass & Rick Melick is at the Keyboards with very special guest appearances by Beth Hart, John Hiatt & Paul Rodgers!  Kevin ""Caveman"" Shirley who also produced Dust Bowl is again credited for the astounding sound mix that must be heard to be believed, and indeed everyone involved in the production of this sensational DVD should take a bow!

Joe Bonamassa continues to fascinate his audience with his gifted guitar and passionate vocals, and whilst extending his own repertoire, he also makes sure he pays tribute to all the people who inspired him along the way.  Like all great musicians Joe Bonamassa knows it's not just what you play that's important, but how you feel and deliver it that matters... and this guy certainly knows how to do just that!

Disc 1 (Feature) starts with an interesting opening sequence showing Joe Bonamassa busking '72nd St. Subway Blues' at the same location in New York.  He then joins his band at the Beacon Theatre to open the show with his pulsating 'Slow Train' followed by 'Cradle Rock', 'When The Fire Hits The Sea', 'Midnight Blues', 'Dust Bowl' and 'The River'.  Next enter one of the most powerful female blues/rock singers to emerge since Janis Joplin... Beth Hart joins Joe onstage, having worked together on Dust Bowl before making their stunning hit collaboration album Don't Explain.  Bonamassa's guitar once again provides the perfect foil for Hart's soulful vocals as she beautifully delivers Brook Benton's 'I'll Take Care Of You' (worth the entry fee alone) and then pleads for mercy on 'Sinner's Prayer', probably just as Ray Charles imagined when he wrote it... simply breathtaking!

Worthwhile renditions of 'You Better Watch Yourself'' and 'Steal Your Heart Away' precede a heartfelt cover of Leonard Cohen's 'Bird On A Wire'.  American songwriter/musician John Hiatt then makes his entrance with 'Down Around My Place' off his excellent Dirty Jeans And Mudslide Hymns album and 'I Know A Place' that nearly brings the house down, and rightly so as this storyteller is way overdue the recognition he truly deserves!  After being treated to 'Blue and Evil' off his Black Rock album, rock royalty takes centre stage with Paul Rodgers (Free/Bad Co/Queen) singing the first song he ever wrote 'Walk In My Shadow', prior to strutting out another Free classic 'Fire And Water' aptly fuelled by Bonamassa with Kossoff inspired guitar riffs... totally spellbinding!  And just as you thought this concert couldn't get any better, you get blown away with a monumental version of 'Mountain Time' before 'Young Man Blues' ends this memorable set.

Disc 2 (Bonus Disc) boasts another couple of fine tracks from the gig... 'If Heartaches Were Nickels' and his acoustic extravaganza 'Woke Up Dreaming'.  Other special features include 'A Friend Drops By' that reveals amazing footage of Joe discussing chord structures with Byrds/CSNY legend David Crosby!  Finally 'A Busker's Tale' explains the making of '72nd St. Subway Blues' that opened proceedings followed by some memorable photos & credits... end!

For those of you who couldn't make it... Joe Bonamassa: Beacon Theatre - Live From New York is a modern day musical happening thankfully captured 'live' on Saturday, November 5th 2011 and is as good as it gets... enjoy the ride!",1331856000,101,3556,5.052991452991453
5054637,5,B0074JODP8,"I just watched my 2nd show with Joe Bonamassa on KQED, and have totally fallen in love with his music.  I did purchase at the $125.00 level, so I could get all the music from that night of ""Live at The Royal Albert Hall!""  I have been to the RAH in London on 3 different ocassions to see my favorite band, The Moody Blues, so the RAH has very good memories for me.  I've also been very busy on amazon.com buying more of his music.  I also purchased a ticket for his show in Fresno, CA, that is coming up on 19 Apr 2012, and can't wait to see him live.  I had never heard of this guy, but when he invited Eric Clapton to come out and play a song with him, I would have to say that Joe Bonamassa ""Has Arrived.""  He is fantistic and awesome, and very methodical at times, which puts him in his own style of music.  Thank God for KQED introducing this young man to us, as he is definitly has come into his own!!!  Like Stevie Ray Vaughn says, ""If the house is rockin', come on in.""

5054638,5,B0074JODP8,Joe is loaded with talent. The DVD looks and sounds great. Has a great group of musicians playing with him.,1331596800,,107,4.4
5054639,5,B0074JODP8,"I was there for the concert and it was great. Joe was super as usual giving his all. The concert sold out in about 20 mins. There was a second night added later. It was almost a duplicate of the one earlier in the year at westbury but for the addition of guest performers. Been looking forward to the dvd. I hope it does it justice. I do have to add that even though I liked both concerts last year, his live at the Albert Hall was my favorite.

Update after release
The more i see it the more i like it.  Joe gave another great performance. This concert was augmented by some great blues singers. When Joe pairs up with Beth Hart it is really great. Beths performance in sinners prayer brought strong reminesence of the immortal Janis Joplin. With Joes guitar getting into heavy blues and Beths singing there is magic and it is like capturing lightning in a bottle. I look forward to their collaboration on an album together. What a combination! paul rogers too made a good pairing with Joe.  We all know Joe can sing and needs little but he had a good idea putting his playing guitar with other singers. This is what makes this a standout concert to own with albert hall. The only disappointment with this dvd is they left out some of the concert like just got paid and sloe gin two of my favorites. I was seeking a complete replay of the experience and didn't get it but this is still extremely worthy whether you were there or not. The beacon is a must have with albert hall. Enjoy and keep an eye on Beth Hart.
New addition:
Beth hart and joe bonamassa album is out and the title is ""dont explain"". After listening to the collaboration album the first time i thought it was so so but after a few more times it got better as i listened to it. Sinners prayer was better on the dvd but most of this album has style and Beth can really sing the blues with her own imprint not just singing in the style of Janis but with other influences present to form her own way of warbling. Chocolate jesus is very catchy too and your heart is as black as night is a sultry affair. Joes production company put out this album and beth has a future. They team well together. Buy this one too, i don't think you will be disappointed.",1331510400,3,2218,4.263657957244655
5054640,5,B0074JODP8,"Right now I'm recording KQED's (PBS in the San Francisco Bay Area) broadcast of Joe Bonamassa's Beacon theatre - Live from New York.  It's my custom to not watch it while it's recording but I jumped in just when Joe was starting Mountain Time.  I still haven't heard all of it, it doesn't matter. I'm on Amazon and now I'll have the DVD in a matter of days.  I own everything he has ever done and I really didn't think he could play a better rendition of Mountain Time; I was so wrong.  Buy this DVD, play it till your ears ring with his music, I will.  He is absolutely, positively, the best.",1331078400,4,593,4.212389380530974

I had pre ordered this right away as Joe can do no wrong in my book...another great release, and from the Blu Ray track list much different set list than Royal Albert as this release coincides with Dust Bowl. Beth Hart, John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers each guest on 2 tracks apiece.  Amazing concert.  Enjoy!",1330992000,4,437,4.493670886075949

If you extracted a healthy measure of talent and style from SRV, Clapton, Les Paul, B.B.King, and Jimmy Page and mixed it all in a cauldron infused with other-worldly magic, then placed it in one guitar player, youd have Joe B.

Stunning sound, stellar camera work, great set list and killer guest performances. The John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers guest appearances alone would justify the purchase. I own 45 Blu Ray / DVD rock & Blues concerts and this show is solid top 5.
