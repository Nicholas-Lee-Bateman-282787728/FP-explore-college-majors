4625341,3,B0059XTU1S,"He's also now added the same mistake he made in King Kong of indulging in excess - and I'm not referring to the length. The problem is not the length but that everything is over the top, from the size of the trolls and orcs to the scale of the special effects and the set pieces like the battles.

But what are these mistakes he made in LOTR? Well the ones now anyone can even see from the trailers and clips for this new film are the ones that struck me first in the other films, namely: too many facial close-ups; too much zooming and panning, too much swooping  moving-crane or airborne camera always in perpetual movement; excessive use of the wide angle lens which distorts space and perspective; the old fashioned dubbing of the actor's voices; and in particular  too much close-miked dubbing of Gandalf's voice which has him sounding as if he's muttering to himself, or as if we're meant to be 'hearing' his thoughts. The tendency towards using too many close-ups means that we seldom get enough shots of figures in context which would allow for some impressive framing and contribute to a sense of atmosphere. But at least the close ups aren't quite as much of a problem as they were in LOTR.
As usual we have to put up with New Zealand instead of Tolkien's intended English landscape. The English countryside, landscape and atmosphere is a very important part of Tolkien's imagination and we've not enough here which can be mistaken for the real thing even in the earlier stages of the journey.
Like all big budget action films these days it's all too much 'in your face', and surely it should be obvious that this is not the right visual style for 'The Hobbit' the book. These constant camera movements, sometimes violent, and the fast editing, are all very familiar anyway having been used increasingly for the last 20 years, but here they are really overdone. The almost continual movement here is no doubt the result of trying to get the max out of 3D - as is the number of times things come suddenly towards you and jump out of the frame. It's also obvious that the battles are overdone with far too many evil goblins against so few in the company of dwarves, resulting in the unbelievable, yet nauseating, slaughter of the many by the indestructible few.

In addition much of it looks very artificial with the dwarves looking either like Disney cartoons brought to life or like good looking actors dressed up to look like romantic Vikings, or some such, and not dwarves at all - everyone seems to have too much make-up on. Still these things are perhaps not fatal to the final effect of the film because after all The Hobbit is not the sacred book that LOTR is, and this is going to be a big family movie. On the other hand Martin Freeman looks not much more like a Hobbit than the actors in LOTR did - for a start he's not fat enough and what's more he looks just like Martin Freeman. It seems to me this sort of casting alone condemns all the films to inevitable failure for the true Tolkien enthusiast, and this and they would have been better family films if an effort had been made to look for some fairly small unusual looking people to play the parts. In any case we certainly don't need to have recognisable actors like Ken Stott and James Nesbitt who obviously make suspension of disbelief impossible before we've started.
This film and LOTR had no business with being about actors and acting and would have been better off with total unknowns in every part. And everyone knows that Bilbo looked something like a younger Paul Simon, don't they?

And then there is the music. We have been subjected to the same old music all over again, which those of us who disliked it the first time around, finding it inappropriate in tone, style and scale, as well as poor in quality, inevitably feeling it even more intolerable  to hear again. In fact IF this music was going to be repeated why would we want to see the film at all, if we know and love the book, or indeed the old 1968 BBC radio serial?
But even if there had been new  music I suppose that given the same composer it was always going to be the same overblown all-purpose generic BIG film music that we hear all the time for any subject that isn't trying to be 'cool' and contemporary. And surely one of the worst things about the music in the case of the LOTR films was that the Hobbits in the Shire were given music with a strongly Irish or Scottish flavour. Now even one of the Dwarves  has an unmistakable Northern Irish accent and another one a Scottish. But why should we be surprised when it seems so often that any film maker setting out to make a film 'entertaining' also feels that he can forget any need to achieve a sense of reality (albeit what Tolkien called 'secondary reality') other than by means of costumes and CGI
This kind of soundtrack makes any sort of detachment - upon which enchantment depends - extremely difficult. And enchantment is a large part of what a 'secondary world' is all about (we have Tolkien's word for that).

Anyway the music is mostly just the same stuff we were given in LOTR and which alone would have been enough to ruin the final effect of however good a film it might have been.  Like the rest  it's film muzak, the current industry standard for 'big' films,  and can be produced on demand by the yard.
I said that the music is in the wrong style anyway, but it's not that I don't love the late-Romantic style when it's done well as it used to be by John Williams, and he CAN do enchantment too, but even he wouldn't be right for LOTR or The Hobbit. What is needed I believe is something much more pared down, and that could be something more contemporary in terms of serious music (contemporary classical music if you will) or it could be something in the ancient manner like our medieval music, or the classical music of some other cultures. A blu-ray disc could even give us a choice - or no music at all.

I do realize that most of what I have called faults are just the sort of thing the film industry now demands when it wants a huge box-office and marketing success to rival all the superhero films based on comics. This is why the current style of film music in action films, with all its heavy dependence on sudden physical shocks (produced by the new bass technology and 5.1 surround), is all of a piece with fast and constantly mobile camera movement in three dimensions and fast editing, and why the commercial film industry insists on so many close-ups. The frequent close-ups are also related to the close miking and dubbing of the voices as a strategy for the total immersion which is supposed to provide the maximum possible manipulation of the consumer. It can be appropriate for some subjects where the emphasis is on character and acting but it doesn't work for epic narratives like LOTR and I don't believe it will work for an equally extended three part Hobbit which, with otherwise good justification, is obviously intended to represent another part of the epic story of the Ring. Epic requires some distance, and so does enchantment.

I strongly recommend everyone listens to the 1968 BBC radio serial of The Hobbit which has been available for some time on a CD set. It has a magic this film can't achieve, and the theme music and the Dwarves' song are just right. I also recommend its wonderfully idiosyncratic Gandalf. It has no great aspiration to the epic any more than did Tolkien's original book and is much more in keeping with its style. I have no objection to the the narrative being upscaled to the epic for this new film but for the reasons I have given I don't think has succeeded  much more than the LOTR films did. I am not recommending the BBC radio serial of LOTR from around 1982.

But Gollum is still a wonder of at least one aspect of the film industry, and at least one way it has done Tolkien justice.",1353801600,6,7873,4.487430167597766

4625404,2,B0059XTU1S,"If you are a fan of the original book The Hobbit, this movie will probably disappoint you. The opening scene of the dwarfs meeting Bilbo is pretty true to the book but after that it starts to deviate.  Its not true to the original book. There are characters, events, and entire plot lines that do not exist in the book. Also, the original book would translate well into a movie with some action. But its not meant to be an action movie. This movie is obviously another tired example of the new genre of movies whos real purpose is to sell the video games to be released under the same name. If you want to see a movie thst takes the classic book and turns it into an action film where every character is a martial arts swordmaster like in a video game, changes the plot, and adds characters, then this is your movie.",1526688000,,816,4.298701298701299

4625408,3,B0059XTU1S,"This movie could have been alot better in my opinion, but that's because I was expecting something a bit more epic thanks to the Lord of the rings trilogy. For whatever reason the graphics and animation was too cheesy and childish overall. But it's a good reminder that this story was intended for younger audiences, originally. It would have been better if the Moria was done better. The book had my heart racing. The spiders in the forest scene could have  also been alot better (though not sure they even had it in this movie, now that I think about it). Must not have been memorable. This is great to watch with your kids but not so much if you want more seriousness. I genuinely hope Amazon can create a serious series comparable to something like game of thrones (from what I've seen) or Salem (very dark) for their ""Lord of the rings"".",1525564800,,842,4.503267973856209

The problem I had with this movie was just it took so long to get going.  Then when it did, it was still not enough for me.

Add: extraneous characters and old characters nowhere near the original. Use made up character to create a non existence romance between Dwarves, who can not suddenly be dashing and handsome simply to use as fodder to paf the story into oblivion.

This train-wreck was NOT ""The Hobbit"", merely a story (uninspired by it. Pure drek of what should have been another masterpiece.",1504742400,,643,4.944444444444445

4625765,3,B0059XTU1S,"Only very loosely based on the (part of the) book! Neither the Necromancer, Radegast, the Lady Galadriel nor Saruman appear in the original tale by J.R.R. Tolkien. ""The Hobbit"" outright invents entire events and does not stay true to the characters in the book. The dwarfs are unlike those portrayed in the book. Interestingly, it appears to pick up and present the extensive and careful landscape description that is found in ""The Lord of the Rings"" throughout, but which is near absent in ""The Hobbit"" as it is was written for a younger audience.

 As a fantasy tale approached without expectations it's a good movie (which makes three stars), though it is cliched as in the feud between Thorin and Bilbo or the pitching of arch enemies against each other as in Azog vs Thorin. I would have loved to see the characters, atmosphere and the  fantastic adventure of Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" on the screen, but this is not it.",1503792000,,922,4.75

4625853,2,B0059XTU1S,"Just because I love Tolkien's tales and have read The Hobbit many times since I was a kid, doesn't mean I have to like the movie. I wanted to, since Peter Jackson did such a wonderful job capturing Middle Earth in LOTR. But The Hobbit -- in its three parts to tell the tale -- is ungodly long and doesn't really catchy the attitude of the book, which to me means it lacks the charm and pace of the original text.
I've tried more than once to watch this through appreciative eyes, but since sitting through it in the theater, I cannot make it all the way through. At home, when I have the power to choose, I get bored with it and change to something else. Sorry, to me it feels like an appropriation of a classic story by an iconic author simply to make money.
For me, the only way to visit Middle Earth is through the books themselves. Tolkien's stories told with Tolkien's prose and poetry. Any interpretation by another is a view once removed, and the experience suffers by comparison.",1497052800,9,987,4.369565217391305

I am not a fan of fantasy fiction, and it was warchung The Desolation Of Smaug, when I was looking for something to watch one day,  that made me go back and watch The Hobbit :  An Unexpected Journey.

And I loved!!!!! This Trilogy.  It is up there with the original Star Wars Trilogy in terms of awesome story telling.

The Goblins, trolls, Gollum and the special effects were beyond amazing.

But the story itself that makes the whole movie worthwhile.

After seeing the Hobbit, I decided to watch the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  I had only seen parts of the Fellowship.  The Hobbit movies definitely make the series of movies so good.

They take every chance to drag in elements from the lord of the rings and take one sentence references from the book and expand them into very long complicated plot lines, filled with more dark depressing themes.  Worst of all, they completely make up parts that aren't in any book.  A romance between a dwarf and an elven princess?!!!  Incredibly stupid idea.",1485388800,,689,4.73109243697479

Witlessly conceived, unimaginatively executed and glacial in pace. Beyond that however, I found the lack of diversity in the film to be shameful. Especially since all the of characters and cultures in the story are entirely imagined, it was abhorrent to see that there were literally zero people or characters of color in the film. None in leading roles and none visible even as extras in the background. What a tired, passively racist world view. In addition, with the exception of one leading female character, the same lack is true for females visibly present. Again, a single role and then nothing more. Just curious, how do these societies reproduce? Are they misogynist separatist cults? I'm a white male and a father of a young daughter. In this 21st century, we live in a diverse world inspired by the breadth of contributions by men and women around our interconnected world. Uh just asking, don't people of color, girls and women buy tickets to movies as well? I will support films that combine relevant plots with authentic creativity over shrunken, distorted and recycled white suprematist and patriarchal visions. Whether they're fictional or not.

I don't enjoy all the CGI or the unrealistic physics of some scenes (escaping the goblins, or the barrel scene in Desolation of Smaug). I also thought making three movies out of one (not that big by the way) book was a little unnecessary. When I saw them in theaters I thought they seemed rather clunky. I must say, the extended edition makes this movie a heck of a lot better. It flows as a story much better, and while some reviewers may say most of the extra scenes in an unexpected journey don't add much, I think they make the movie a lot more enjoyable, especially the first half.

4626351,5,B0059XTU1S,"This movie is the best movie ever because of its graphics, it starts to introduce the lord of the rings, and The way it starts out with Bilbo as he is old is awesome.  I saw the movie like a HUNDRED times through and it still is really good.  It had a lot better graphics than the first lord of the rings movie. Bit by bit in each movie it starts leading up to the first the lord of the rings movies.  There is little swearing for smaller audiences.  All in all it was a great movie but I hate in the lord of the rings how its always changing perspectives from like Merry and Pippin to Sam and Frodo to Aragorn Legolas etc.  Just confused the crap out of me, but in the Hobbit it rarely changes perspectives in it.

Ian McKellan seemed weary of the Gandalf role and his platitudes admonished upon Bilbo, the chosen carryover from the prior movies, seemed all to disingenuous.

I wish they had either stuck with the true story line  or some how tweaked the name to let you know they tinkered with the story line.  I now have an answer as to how The Hobbit could possible -ever, be worth a three movie series.  Also the violence and battle scenes they added were a shock.",1476921600,,453,3.869565217391304

4626557,3,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson invokes memories of his Lord of the Rings though stretching a single book to four long films seems slightly extreme. We begin with Frodo and Bilbo at Baggend before slipping back to Bilbos youth. His hobbit hole is invaded by houseguests from hell, dwarfs who proceed to raid his substantial larder and eat and drink everything in sight plus play frisbee and other games with his plates and cutlery. Had he not joined them hed have had nothing left to eat.

The Dwarfish cast have the deepest basso profundo voices the agents could find and their voices rumbling in song vibrate the window panes as much as their snoring does later.

Somehow the pacing here seems to drag.... By contrast the pivotal scene in the entire 24-hour-long saga in which Bilbo burgles the one ring passes rather quickly.  Its been too many decades since I read the original for me to comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation

We get to see extended views of spectacular New Zealand scenery, lengthy fight and chase scenes riddled with special effects but three hours is a long time to sit.",1475625600,,1084,4.71957671957672

I found the beautiful landscapes visually stimulating and ultimately entertaining! That's all I expect from a great flick... one that de-stresses and takes me away from the day-to-day. However, I do wish someone would tell me what's included with the Extended Editions vrs Bonus Features for the Amazon Video purchases Only. Amazon should list what's included but they don't. Maybe there's somebody who just loves to type reviews and will let us all know the details.

The story didn't contain a drawn-out mushy love story at its core--just enough to give you those ""Awww"" moments--but had plenty of action and gave the background behind LOTR.

4627166,5,B0059XTU1S,"When I was a kid I soaked up all there was that Tolkien produced. The Hobbit was one of my favorite books. After The Lord of the Rings I was waiting and hoping that the movie industry would take on this monster of a production. This is the first of the three movies and it compromises only 1/3 of the book. Tolkien had a way with wordiness. There was some critics that said this production was not up to snuff after the epicness we got in The Lord of the Rings, but this story is far more simple and far more devious at the same time. It tells you about the small things that led to the big things in the world we have already seen in The Lord of the Rings. We learn the history and the back story behind all those huge battles, and we see people being... people... or in this case. Hobbitses. Yes there are epic proportions to this story but it is a beginning, building to an end we have already seen.",1463443200,,902,4.101694915254237

4627198,3,B0059XTU1S,"I read the Hobbit many years ago, and it was great to see it come alive in the same way as the Lord of the Rings t Trilogy did. The film was excellent, however there is an inconsistency between PRIME video and VERIZON on demand which I would appreciate if AMAZON could explain. I am hard of hearing and use a special digital headphone amplifier attached to my receiver by optical cable where the digital signal is not modified by the receiver - I can listen at my volume and my wife can listen to the speakers at the volume she chooses with our Home Theater receiver.
Here is the thing: Using Amazon PRIME no sound is transmitted to me on the optical cable
BUT renting the same movie from Verizon On Demand - does transmit the audio signal over my OPTICAL CABLE/Headphone Digital amp/Headphones which is a much more enjoyable experience for me.

Until AMAZON can explain why the digital sound in the movie is not transmitted via PRIME video I will rent through Verizon On Demand.

If AMAZON had a live person you could talk with about issues like this, this would not have made it to a public statement.

The movie would have got 5 stars for me if the digital sound had been there",1462838400,,1180,4.4036697247706424

4627281,2,B0059XTU1S,"This movie is not true to the book The Hobbit.  Instead, it is a mix mash of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion.  While there are some good scenes, like the unexpected party, there are too many additional scenes that were never in the book, but that are jarringly interspersed throughout the movie. Even when the movie is projecting a scene from the book, it misses the point.  One example is that Thorin's beard is more of a 5:00 shadow.  That should concern you.  Thorin is a dwarf, but they make him look like a Aragon!  In the book, Dwarfs have beards--all of them.  Then, there are the trolls.  In the book the trolls are bumbling, rude, dim-witted, oafs with cockney accents.  In the movie they are just monsters.  This scene completely misses the fun that is Tom, William, and Bert bumbling around like idiots, and replaces it with something more akin to  the mountain troll in LOTR.

In the end, this movie was just not enjoyable after the first ""unexpected party"" scene in which we were introduced to a beardless dwarf. Bummer, because I really wanted to like this.",1462060800,,1095,4.587628865979381

I haven't seen the other two in this series yet, but my sense on this one is that they padded the material to make it stretch to three films.  There are several  jarring anachronisms and some of the action scenes last so long that they actually start to be a snooze fest and the film loses forward momentum because someone wanted to show off some whiz bang special effect.

I've always enjoyed Martin Freeman's, from the first time I saw him in ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"", as Watson in ""Sherlock"" and now as a ""young"" Iam Holmes, the actor who created our first view of Bilbo Baggins. He, fortunately, doesn't try to ""play"" a young Ian Holmes, but takes full control of the character as his own interpretation. I was well pleased with casting of the dwarves, but since there are so msny, none of them can stand out on their, except for Thorin. All in all, a fun trip, again, across the beautiful New Zeeland countryside, with good VFX to fill-in the world of Midfle Earth, but it still lacks in bringing out all the characters as they are, as I said, just part of the scenry. 4 out 5 for a good effort, but bit draggy in parts that should have left on the cutting room floor.

Taken on their own, they're decent movies, but they can't hold a candle to the original trilogy.  As far as this trilogy goes, this film is solidly middle of the road.  It rarely reaches the heights that the second film occasionally achieves, but neither is it a disaster as the final film was.  There are moments in this film that are genuinely exhilarating (especially Gollum's scene), and Martin Freeman and Ian McKellan remain enchanting throughout.

As it turns out this DVD has ""The Desolation of Smaug"" encoded as the DVD title and the ""Smaug"" DVD cover picture of Bilbo when I play the film using Windows Media Player.

The ""suspense moments"" are drawn out, physically impossible, and way to numerous. What I experienced watching this trilogy was rare; I actually became psychologically detached from experiencing the movie and my heart was in pain at watching the overly-sappy screenplay.

I could nitpick plot here, but I'm sure all that can be said already has. My biggest disappointment in that category was the love story, and that's all I'll say. Overall, the movie was horrible both in screenplay and in paying homage to the books. I can more or less call the plot and screenplay from the Lord of the Rings trilogy fair enough, considering the complexity and ""boring parts"" of Tolkien's work being a cinematic challenge; however, this trilogy was downright embarrassing. You can check my other reviews - I'm not a hater.

4627897,3,B0059XTU1S,"Review for the regular film not extended

After seeing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.  The movie was decent.  Overall much better than average like a lot of the reviews are giving it.  I thought it was far better than the dreadful Star Wars prequel films.  The actors are all strong, likeable and do a nice job portraying their characters.  The story moved along well.  I thought it stole some scenes to similar to The Fellowship of the Ring.  Especially with the rock fighting giants, while our heroic party is edging along the side of a cliff with objects falling on them.  I thought that whole scene was unnecessary because the film already had plenty of action scenes.  The film confuses itself on who the main villain is.  Do the dwarves want to get back in their home of the lonely mountain or the mines of Moria?  I thought the Dragon Smog was the main villain, but in this film it is a white orc named Azog.

Then the film goes off in another direction with a crazy forest wizard and a necromancer villain who is poisoning a whole forrest.  It leads you to the notion that one of the Nasghouls is still alive.  I think they are trying to tie in the origins of the Witch King of Agmar.  This would be incredibly interesting to see how this plays out in the next film,.  It could help form the basis of the following trilogy far better than Star Wars did with that prequel trilogy.  The film is a little slow to get things going.  It seemed like everyone in the theater was cheering once Bilbo finally leaves his house, and the party gets on its way.

The only part I disliked about the movie was the Goblin King getaway scene.  Where the dwarves are chased being chased by the goblin army after in the underground kingdom.  This whole scene seemed to much like the chase scene from the Mines of Moria.  There is a ridiculous part where they fall down a vast caussom on some planks of wood hundreds of feet in the air down a narrow ravine and no one gets hurt when they hit bottom.  The whole battle scene was to much like the ""A-Team"" for me and requires a lot of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer.  You never see any of our hero's get injured, or even exhausted from the fighting.  After awhile you get the feeling that they are not even in danger.  Remember these are supposed to be ordinary dwarves not champion fighters of their race like Legolas, Gimli, Aragon, and Boromir and they mow down goblins like superman, without any effort or exertion.

When Bilbo finds the ring it is set up differently than what was portrayed in LOTR movies.  Remember the ring just up and left Gollum in those films and in this movie it just happens to slip right out of his clothing as he wrestles with the goblin.  I think the scene in the LOTR movies was done a little better.  It would have been kind of cool to have Sauron use some kind of telepathy to abandon Gollum.  Since when is Gollum a cannibal?  It has been a long time since I read the original Hobbit.

Overall I was fascinated much more  by the non action scenes, where you get to meet the characters in the Lord of the Rings movies.  You know how their futures will play out.  Scenes with Soroman, and the lady of the wood and Lord Elrond are all great.  But I was confused in the story who the lead elf king Thranduil was in the film how was he related to Elrond maybe a brother perhaps?  What happened to the 3 rings given to the elves?  Was he one of the 3 Elves given a magic ring at the beginning of the Fellowship of the Rings movie?  The film also does not really explain why the dragon is so attracted to gold.  It just leaves it with an open question ""when one craves nothing but wealth bad things happen.""  Though this may be true but it leaves a lot unsaid about what drove the Dragon Smog to make the Lonely Mountain his home.  Maybe I just need to read The Simarillion to find the answers to these questions.

You do see scenes and places out of the other films that will be familiar with the audience.  Broken Top, Rivendale, The Shire of course.  Like the Fellowship the movie is just a setup film to what comes next.  I thought it was definitely worth watching but left with the feeling that it was not as good as The Fellowship of the Ring.  Another thing that came to mind while watching the end of the film is why didn't the Eagles just drop the party right off at the Lonely Mountain.  Also after Thorin is injured by Azog he must have Wolverines healing power to be back up on his feet so soon after being in a big beasts jaws.",1450051200,2,4528,4.288075560802834

4628065,1,B0059XTU1S,"Here is my brief spoiler free review.

Peter Jackson went full on George Lucas with this trilogy.  He took a beloved part of my childhood and dragged it through a large pile of excrement.  I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings many times since I was a kid.  I enjoyed the old Rankin/Bass animated version of The Hobbit.  Growing up, we had the condensed audio version on vinyl.  Back in the sixties (before my time) when my family cabin was being built, a 14 year old kid painted the artwork from the old Lord of the Rings trilogy in a brilliant mural across the wall.  It made this old, decrepit cabin a magical place to spend time growing up.

I loved Peter Jackson's adaptation of TLOTR.  I felt his movies did justice to the books as few adaptations ever do.  The Hobbit is a different beast.  I saw the first one in the theatre and hated it.  Being a huge movie buff and collector of DVD and Bluray, I still had to own the extended versions of the first two films, and I will purchase the last, but it doesn't mean I'll ever watch them.  The impression that I got was that Jackson knew he was out of hobbit material so he tried to milk as much money as he could by turning a 200 and something page children's book into a 10 hour epic piece of crap.  Most of the material in these movies is the creation of Jackson, not Tolkien.  The basic plot is the same, everything else was made up.  The movie is beautiful to watch and well acted, but I got such a Star Wars prequel vibe with each successive movie.  I've had to wait for the films to be released on HBO because I did not want to spend a dime more than what it would cost me to own the extended versions.  I guess that makes me a hypocritical rube.  Congrats, Pete!  You got my money in the end.

I hope someone buys the rights to The Silmarillion.  Not so they will make a movie, but so they will keep the material out of Peter Jackson's hands.",1445212800,3,1914,4.1580381471389645

4628078,1,B0059XTU1S,They changed the entire plot and story. Bilbo didn't kill until the spiders in the book - his entire character is wrong in the movie. In the book his biggest antagonist was learning detachment from his comforts at home and what he knows. This movie took a wonderful book and added a demonic/satanic character that hunts the company and changes the feel (PLOT!) of the entire story. This movie is just another duke it out good vs. evil hollywood action with a lot of stupid added plots that prolong the story. I am disappointed and wish it had never been made and that I had never seen it. I guess society is becoming so numb to violence that hollywood has  glorify it in everything...,1444348800,5,684,4.516129032258065

4628124,4,B0059XTU1S,"My opinion only and this review is for all 3 parts.  The actor who plays Bilbo does an excellent job of bringing him to life, rounding out his character from what little we see of the aging Bilbo in LOTR.  We also get to see a whole other type of dwarf from the guy in LOTR--these dwarfs seem to be a taller variety.  The Hobbit book was only one book long so I do not see why Jackson felt he should break the movie into 3 parts, it really wasn't worth 3 (maybe 2 at most) and it kind of hurts to think he did it simply for money (I would like to have some delusions).  I'd gone back and reread The Hobbit book again before seeing the movie just to refresh my memory but the book is so unmemorable itself, rereading it really didn't help.  The pros for me were you get to go back to the Shire (a place I'd love to live) before the bad stuff started happening (in LOTR and after--if you didn't read the books you missed the whole ""after"" part because Jackson doesn't cover that in the movies).  And I thought the rendering of the dragon was excellent although I found the voice of the dragon not right (not sure why, I just know dragons don't sound like that).  I also don't know why Jackson felt he needed to bring Legolas into this, or why he needed to stick a love story between the elf lady and the dwarf guy--just seemed to be completely useless, too time consuming and what was the point?  Many of the changes Jackson made to the storyline don't make any sense except that he wanted to extend the story so he could have 3 parts to generate money off of.  Even the battle between 5 armies--you'd think it's be one hell of a battle but it wasn't.  The battle wasn't even as good as most of the skirmishes between orcs and others in LOTR.  You see Gollum briefly in the beginning but then nothing more after that until LOTR.  I just feel that these movies were just money generating vehicles for Jackson and nothing more; he didn't feel the heart and should for The Hobbit as he had with LOTR and it showed.",1443312000,2,2009,4.203125

So why is the Hobbit (1 book) made into 3 movies? Obviously money.
On the plus side, Peter Jackson and his crew have done a nice job of staying true to the story and bringing the book to life. For that you must give them credit.
On the negative the movie is WAY TOO SLOW. That's the problem with stretching out 1 book into 3 3-hour movies - you can totally feel the parts where they are 'stretching' things to fill space. It's a shame.
I could even see 2 movies and it would have been faster paced, but 3 is just way too slow!!",1442016000,2,590,4.008474576271187

4628294,4,B0059XTU1S,"First, I admit that I'm a fussy purist with these things. I first read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in high school about 45 years ago, and enjoyed them so much that I have read them again and again. After seeing LOTR I knew pretty much what to expect from The Hobbit, which was not to expect too much. More irrelevant unnecessary filler; dumb things that Tolkien would definitely detest, like Dwarves coming into a strangers home and using a piece of furniture to scrape mud off his boots(!), and then sitting down to eat and throwing food at each other; and the exaggerated chases and crudeness that seem to turn on the baser folk of today. Sad.

And then there are things which bother people who think and reason. Just one example: Beorn shows a shackle on his wrist and tells about his once being held captive. When he changes to a bear, what happens to that shackle? If it remained, the bear would be in serious pain and limping. Or does the shackle stretch and then shrink back again? Beorn looks pretty strong and clever with tools, so why doesn't he remove it? The Dwarves are especially famous for their cleverness with tools, forging, metalworking, etc. Why don't they offer to remove it? Gandalf is a wizard (supposedly, although many times throughout this movie you have to wonder...), so why doesn't he offer to remove it? Pure silliness that Hollywood folk don't think through when they add unneeded filler. Within the Tolkien world of fantasy -- in the books -- the stories and histories make sense, there are no conflicts or contradictions. The movies don't have that.

Enough of that. On the plus side, it is fun to see the characters all made up and on stage doing their bits. The parts that are true to the book are done very well. If you can turn off the need to be loyal to the book; turn off the thinking and reasoning part of your head and look at this as an entertainment based on Tolkien's works but finished up in the modern Hollywood way to please the computer gamers, you will probably enjoy it.",1439424000,2,2030,4.4986449864498645

I find it hard to keep paying attention, to keep all the characters straight, and quite frankly, to care.  Have the third movie sitting here but haven't found the three hours to watch it.

4628532,4,B0059XTU1S,I think I summed it up in my other reviews of the series. I won't say much but four stars due to lack of the original story.  Worth watching but the book is ten times better!

4628601,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
 What a great and wonderful pleasure it is to once again hear the liquid syllables of the Elfish tongue delivered by the High Elves themselves.  It has been much too long.  The long awaited prequel to the Lord of the Rings series is now in the theater and it is well worth the wait.  The Hobbit lives up to the astonishingly high standards of the previous Peter Jackson interpretation of Tolkiens master work.  Writer, Producer and Director Peter Jackson again demonstrates his domination of popular culture in this beautifully filmed work of mass art.  He will become even more stupendously rich but it is we the viewers who have won the lottery.  The Hobbit is grand, epic and satisfying.
 Many of our old friends reprise their roles in this prequel to the Lord of the Rings films.  Hugo Weaving and the enormously talented Cate Blanchett are back as the royal rulers of the long living Elves.  Blanchett puts more emotion and grace into simply pacing back and forth than most of us could dream possible.  Christopher Lee is spooky as the wizard Saruman and his colleague Gandolf the Grey is again played with humor, wisdom and pathos by Ian McKellen.  McKellen has Gandolf subtly allow the audience to know that he knows more than he lets the other adventurers know, and that it scares the sap out of him.
 Gollum is entirely computer generated; all save for his unique and unforgettable voice.  Andy Serkis again provides the animating voice to complete the CGI image of the tortured creature.  Martin Freeman is the young and courageous Bilbo Baggins.  The events in The Hobbit are a generation prior to the events in Lord of the Rings.  Richard Armitage plays Thorin Oakenshield and we are permitted to discover why he is called by that name.
 This PG-13 rated movie is very long at two hours and 46 minutes, but not too long.  Fans of Tolkien who know the story will be glad to know that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes the tale from the Shire to just before the adventurers enter the mountain stronghold of the Dragon that drove the Dwarves from their home.  There is a lot of detail in that nearly three hours that the fans will relish.  Two more films in 2013 and 2014 will finish the saga.
 The budget on this four saw blade film is reputed to be around $150 million.  Make no mistake; this will be a huge movie.  In three days it gathered in $141 million worldwide.  Producer Peter Jackson will be rewarded for the genius of Director Peter Jackson.
 This might be a tad less impressive than the Rings trilogy, or maybe I just expect wonders of Jackson-and get them.  I managed to find a flaw or two.  Nonetheless, what a vast pleasure it was to immerse myself once again in the fantastic world that Jackson has created from Tolkiens imagination.  From the opening shots of the hobbit houses through almost three hours of travel, I loved being a part of An Unexpected Journey.",1434326400,,2929,4.633009708737864

Lord Of The Rings was made first and set a standard for movie epics that is hard to measure up to - in a better world this would have been made first - but that is just my view. This has its own magic and is an engrossing adventure full of dwarves, elves, men and monsters that also tells the tale of how Bilbo Baggins found the Ring of Power that was the key to Lord Of The Rings.

4628786,3,B0059XTU1S,"Not bad, not great - Certainly too long. If you have nothing els to do, it's watchable. But, one more time, this film drives home that as long as you can CGI ANYTHING, there is just no ""wow factor"" left. It was only $1.50 for a 3 day rental from our local library, so we didn't lose much.

As always this loses a star for using CGI at all - It loses one more for its overuse and lack of imagination. It would have been AMAZING if it had used ""old school"" special effects!

Before you comment, understand please: This is MY review. My opinion regarding the use of CGI in film has not changed in 30 years - it's not going to change today, for or because of something you or anyone else may try to point out. If practical effects are harder to do, too dangerous to do, too expensive to do - more than they are worth... write around the scene or do the WHOLE thing as a book - simple. If for no other reason, all the wonderful, talented, FX people, model makers and set designers the industry was once known for, may never work again...that's just not right - Sadly, those skills may well end up forever lost. For instance, MUCH of what was generated by CGI in this movie could have been, and SHOULD have been filmed with miniatures and/or hand drawn and painted , frame by frame.",1431561600,,1276,4.225409836065574

As a long-time lover of the Hobbit and LOTR books, and of the LOTR movies, I was surprised that I didn't enjoy the Hobbit movies as much, in the theater, as I'd expected.  I chalked it up to too much anticipation and expectation, but realized that the movies were much too action-packed.  They never let you relax and enjoy the movie before the next action scene.

4628967,5,B0059XTU1S,"an excellent adaptation of the Tolkien novel as only Peter Jackson can deliver.

a very clever writer, Tolkien was, using the exact same formulae for all three of his most famous works, The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and LOTR;
the only difference is the time frame. The cast of characters change but the premise is always the same which is a very convenient catalyst that alleviated him of the pressure of having to come up with an entirely different story each time and it made it easier for him to tie it all up nice and neat.

It was very pleasing to see improvements to some of the special effects, especially the Elven blade that glows in the presence of orcs; in addition to that, we are treated to more Elvish being spoken and Gandalf being more frequently referred to by his Elvish name, Mithrandir.

Galadriel in all 3 movies is an especially satisfying character being given more latitude in this trilogy than in the previous LOTR.

The counsel meeting is especially well done which offers us insights into the relationship between ""The Wise"" elders of middle earth in addition to a brilliant performance by Christopher Lee as Saruman and the very thinly veiled ulterior motives behind his sanguine attitude towards all and any evidence of the second rising of Sauron.

I don't think it was necessary to have Radagast half covered in bird poop; yes we know he was the ""earthy""one and all that but really.
The contrivance of the rabbit pulled sled is cute but also a bit much for my tastes. bunnies are cute n cuddly but enough already.

I believe in my previous review of the 5 Armies I mentioned that I very much prefer Martin Freeman as an actor to Elijah Wood who frankly was starting to get on my nerves after awhile.

The history of the ""sundering"" of the alliance between the Dwarves and Elves is elegantly recounted and my trepidations about the opening scene of The Hobbit were laid to rest as the feasting of the Dwarves at Bilbo's home and the antics that ensued was very nicely orchestrated and directed without any saccharine excesses.

the goblin hall scene is not one of my favorites and I could have done very well without the goblin king breaking into song; at that point it brought to mind a certain studio wherein everybody is belting out a syrupy tune every 15 minutes, which always makes me feel as though I need to get a Rx for insulin.

All in all, certain aspects of this trilogy surpass even the first which was pretty awesome to say the least; but I think Jackson is to be lauded for his ability to convey profound nobility and dignity that are the hallmarks of Tolkien's literary style.",1429747200,,2620,4.605150214592275

4628981,3,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy leaves one feeling the cinematic equivalent of over-eating Thanksgiving dinner. It just feels like too much, especially in relation to the light-hearted feelings one remembers from the book. I'm a huge fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR, and appreciate how well he adapted the trilogy to film. Yet, I believe he could have developed the Hobbit's storyline much more effectively in two films without all the filler (not everything has to be a trilogy). Whereas I never seem to tire of re-watching the LOTR trilogy, I have little appetite for more of the Hobbit.",1429660800,,588,5.010204081632653

4628990,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit as Tolkien intended the story to be told!  If you are looking for the poorly written, badly plotted, disjointed children's story filled with cartoon characters and talking animals that Tolkien told to this grandchildren, look elsewhere; but if you want to see the tale of Bilbo Baggins, the dwarves of Erebor, and events from the Tolkien legendarium that led up to The Lord of the Rings as J. R. R. Tolkien envisioned it in the appendices to the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion, this is for you.

The film draws extensively from Tolkien's other work to fill out the story for the adult audience, and every major plot device is pure Tolkien.  Yes, that includes the tragic romance between an elf maiden and a dwarf.  They appear in the Silmarillion, albeit by other names and in another time and place; but the Tolkien family refuses to release movie rights to the Silmarillion.

I do have my quibbles with Peter Jackson's style of storytelling, though none of the self-proclaimed movie critics have caught them as they copy each others' nincompoopery.  As in the Lord of the Rings films, the movie relies too much on disgusting imagery and behavior for emotional effect; and far too often, Jackson relies on Pure Dumb Luck (or perhaps, as implied, the hand of an unseen and unrevealed deity) to get the characters out of a bad spot.  It's a matter of personal taste, but I've never found disgusting imagery and behavior to be entertaining; quite the opposite; to me, they are, well, simply disgusting.  As for relying on luck, the characters should progress in the story and advance the plot through their own actions, never relying on fantastic luck to provide the path they need or tottering towers to miraculously totter just the right direction at just the right time.  Those little quibbles are a small price to pay to enjoy the tale of The Hobbit fit in the legendarium the way Tolkien outlined it in his work.",1429488000,,1934,4.732142857142857

The pacing could use a little work as it takes a while for the journey to actually begin.  Once it gets going though it is just as fun a thrill ride with the memorable scenes from the book.  I feel that the run time is a little long, but overall it was a fun experience.

I like some of the musical themes that they have with this film as well, especially the dwarf song.  It sets up nice for the journey and is a wonderful piece to listen to.

It's such a a distortion and a disappointment and I feel the ones who produced it and wrote the screenplay are just plain greedy, and JRR Tolkien must be turning in his grave with the way it came out.

4629137,4,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was the welcome back to Middle Earth many MANY fans have begged Peter Jackson for after his praise-worthy adaption of the Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, this was a movie that foreshadowed the divided opinion fans no-doubt feel about this trilogy. I can rightly describe myself as one of those fans who wished this movie was done differently. Looking back, however, An Unexpected Journey is really not the worst of the trilogy.

One of my criticisms before even seeing it for the first time was when Peter Jackson revealed The Hobbit was going to be three movies instead of two. If neither movie was going to have an extended edition, I believe that would have made a Hobbit series of decent length. My fears became a reality as I discovered how much material they were adding into the story just so The Hobbit could be comparable to The Lord of the Rings.

The worst comparison, to me, is that the entire story of The Hobbit is told as a flashback from Bilbos perspective. Even though movie-going audiences are familiar with The Lord of the Rings as the original story, The Lord of the Rings is actually the sequel to The Hobbit and not the other way around. This steals some of the magic from the original book, only because we cant follow the story from this point without being aware of the future movies. Watching The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in their chronological order is really an obsolete experience.

However, I can honestly admit that the first few scenes of The Hobbit were quite promising when I watched it, as we were introduced to Bilbo Baggins and Gandolf the Grey just as it happened in the original book, and instantly we get to know them as if we were seeing them again for the first time. As he is one of the Shire folk, Bilbo has no interest or need for adventure until Gandolf invites 13 dwarves to his home and explains what business they have with them.

The story of The Hobbit is simple, yet complicated at the same time. The dwarf prince, Thorin and his company are on a quest because their ancient home and treasure was taken from them by a dragon and they hope the help of a burglar like Bilbo Baggins will be enough to take it back. Many of the movies early scenes match the charm of the book quite flawlessly. One of the best changes from the book was the emotional turmoil and inspiration that forced Bilbo into this adventure, giving us time to relate to him and feel for him.

Much of the movie after that, however, is not quite the same. Maybe the most important detail was the PG-13 rating. Just for the sake of argument, The Hobbit is supposed to have a much lighter, child-friendly tone about it; and thats NOT because I grew up on the Rankin/Bass cartoon. The movie version has lots of action and violence that wasn't in the book. Plus, this is NOT the Lord of the Rings 2. However, the events taken from the book are given so much more drama and peril its quite obvious they are going for a movie that isn't anything like the books. The worst part is, there are moments where you can tell this movie is being goofier and more whimsical than the Lord of the Rings but it doesnt mesh as well as the creative team believes it is. This is why I believe The Hobbit should have been toned down until it was rated PG at the very least. Who is going to believe Peter Jackson was thinking this would be an amazing movie while he was reading the book, like he did for The Lord of the Rings?

There are some things that were still done exceptionally well, I must confess. I cant help but admire Ian Mckellens willingness to play Gandalf yet again, because these production standards are hectic but nobody else has the right to play the grey wizard like he does. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is also a win. Martin Freeman not only looks like his character but he also sounds like him and hes even played characters like Bilbo before. There was no British actor more perfect for Bilbo Baggins than Martin Freeman.

Unfortunately, Richard Armitage as the leading Dwarf, Thorin, was a miscast to me because hes much too serious minded. The Hobbit trilogy likes to emphasize Thorins character with a lot of pretense but I personally have a hard time looking up to his character when Richard Armitage acts like hes going to kill everyone he lays eyes on. Plus, while An Unexpected Journey follows the book quite closely, the introduction of another conflict with the orc chieftain Azog was quite unnecessary. He was probably added for the sake of dramatic conflict but his role is emphasized with just as much pretense as Thorin was.

Whether The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was good or not, it really came down to one thing. Was it necessary to make one book into three movies? The Lord of the Rings masterfully told each of its three installments with a solid beginning, middle and end. An Unexpected Journey is the only Hobbit movie that gets credit for having all three parts in one movie. I might not like how the book is being divided, but it took a few viewings before I decided this was a good movie. Its not spectacular like The Lord of the Rings but it could have been special in a different kind of way.

When I sit down to watch I see the story of Bilbo Baggins who was a simple hobbit before a company of dwarfs decided he was the burglar they needed. Bilbo goes through a struggle trying to fit in with his company as he grows to know these misfit wanderers and then finds his courage, as well a place for himself among them. It is a good experience, even if I have to trudge through a few movie sins.

On a strictly personal note, this movie is not everything it could be or should be. If I thought everything good about this movie was enough to make it worthy of Tolkiens original works, Id be lying. The Hobbit is not just another book either because its the story that fantasy authors are still drawing inspiration from. But this is only the first part of the trilogy, and since it is not the worst of the three there are only so many bad things you can say about it.",1428105600,3,6058,4.4397482014388485

4629197,3,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey comes across as an extended piece of LOTR (Peter Jackson version) fan fiction. The characters are essentially the same, so are the situations. Both the good, the bad and the ugly from the original LOTR films has been included: the heroism of warriors, the loyalty of Hobbits, the supernatural wizards, the evil orcs and the comic relief which often borders the ridiculous (think dwarfs in Bilbo's cabin or Radagast's rabbits from Rhosgobel). The combination of all these elements strikes me as somewhat weird! The plot is strikingly similar to the first LOTR film, with the main characters forming a brotherhood, visiting Rivendell, and being chased by evil creatures both above and below ground. Although I'm finally starting to like the LOTR concept, I'm honestly not sure what to do with this particular little detour through Middle Earth, so I tentatively give it three stars. Funny detail: when The Hobbit was recently shown on Swedish TV, the translation was based on ke Ohlmarks' ditto, which both J R R Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien and their loyal brotherhood of fanatical Swedish fans loved to hate.

4629287,4,B0059XTU1S,Hobbit life is a life of comfort and safety. Snug and comfortable with fireplace and fresh food. But when a Hobbit seeks an adventure it is most curious for the fainthearted folk of the Shire. But never the less Gandolf sets Bilbo a new standard and the wee folk are set with a new standard of adventure. A great portrayal in Jackson's film with the warm humour and his attention to the detail of the events of this adventure. Also a new standard in the history of MiddleEarth life. In this case just turning on the DVD player can begin you on a great adventure. It is classic in the sense that you will view it many times into the future.

4629329,3,B0059XTU1S,"For lovers of Tolkien the entire film series of the Hobbit must have been a severe disappointment. I seldom go to a cinema these days, finding the standards of audience behaviour in general to be essentially anti-social with conversations and an emphasis on the often noisy shovelling in of vast quantities of junk-food to be an intrusion on the quality of cinematic experience, so I waited with interest for the release of the DVD's.
Of the film itself, I can only speak of the first episode, since I shall not be purchasing any further episodes.
The opening sequence showing the general outline of ""Hobbiton"" and the introduction of the eponomous character was promising at the start  but was drawn out beyond the needs and soon degenerated into a patronising send up of the original and was  far from the pictures that Tolkien's written words generated in my head. The emphasis on battle scenes and the inordinate length of these overwhelmed the main storyline and slowed down the  action - time, if saved here, could possible have reduced the overall production by at least  one film and might have resulted in a tighter narrative and something more akin to my personal interpretation of Tolkien's intentions.
The pivotal scenes in the story, such as the confrontation  with the Trolls, the journey through the Caverns or Bilbo's witty exchanges with Gollum gave me the impressions of being dropped-in  Cameo scenes that, for the director, were of little importance to the story and something that just had to be slipped in between the big Computer Graphic scenes that would constitute  the  main""money-spinner"" content for teen-age cinema -fans. All in all, I doubt that few of the overgrown children who saw the films but were not already Tolkien devotoees would go away keen to buy the book and participate in the  experience of the ""Real-Hobbit"" adventures as they s[ring from the written page.
Some one once described Radio as Television with better picture. In those terms ""The Hobbit"" series of films would at best produce a new, even lower rung l on the ladder of quality entertainment, with J. R.R Tolkien's  books at the very top of their particular ladder and the film little more than an over-blown bastardisation of one literature's finest works.
Sorry - but no marks out how ever many the film makers want to put for artistic, interpretive or literary merit, but top marks for gratuitous violence and skilful computer ""manipulation to no meaningful end"".
For me, the only persons on the entire film crew with a grasp on what the story was really about was the composer of the score, the conductor and musicians . Great music which like all successful film music across the history of the sound-cinema will stand alone, detached from the film images and will doubtless take its rightful place in the repertoire of serious music, and there you average teen-cine-goer will turn away scornfully and go looking elsewhere for their so-called ""musical entertainment"".  Oh, and in case you are wondering, I have listened to an edited version of the score and I know that it will make a symphonic score to match the other great film-scores of the past. It just awaits the composer getting down to re-assembling the score onto a coherent  form, but of course, that will probably not appeal to those shallow-minded fans of the computer-graphic battle scenes  which reduced the whole experience to the level of a third-rate computer-game - but sadly, that is where the money lies and so that is all that  the audience can expect.
The Unsuspected Journey is the last of the Hobbit trilogy upon which I will waste my money and my gain will be that I can use the time I save by not watching any further poor interpretations by taking down my well-thumbed copy of the book and revisiting the real story.
Unless you are very shallow and an inexperienced reader then buy the book and forget all about what is just one more ""Hollow Hollywood Travesty"" of a fine story...",1425945600,,3969,4.843426883308715

I can understand why Peter put in some of the extra material, i.e. to give background for Lord of the Rings and to explain where Gandalf disappeared to in the book.  BUT putting in AZOG the defiler, the bunny-sledding wizard, and all that crap destroys the charm of the story.  It does keep you awake through some of the slower parts, but is a mockery.  Desolation of Smaug was a bit better, they just put in the barrel ride and pursuit of the dwarves by the orcs.  Fleshed out again the background of what Gandalf was doing to tie the movie to LOTR.

4629535,5,B0059XTU1S,"I had to watch The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey twice to appreciate just how well put together and well-acted it is.  Up until I saw this one, LOR:  The Fellowship of the Ring was my favorite because it had better character development than The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  Other than delving deeper into Gollum, Two Towers and Return of the King were mostly focused on war with the Orcs and trying to defeat Sauron (yes, that's the story, but ever evolving character development always wins out with me... other stories have done it a bit better than Two Towers and Return of the King).

The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey was an unexpected pleasure from beginning to end.  The casting was perfect and far better than the Lord of the Rings series.  The continuity of the movie was equally perfect.  The Desolation of Smaug was OK, still riveting, but not nearly as well developed as An Unexpected Journey.

This is the one to rule them all - perfection.  I was literally left speechless the last time I saw it - it is that good.",1424476800,,1042,4.518716577540107

I don't feel like anything was lost or injured in his telling and do, in-fact enjoy them. His imagery and effects make these movies absolutely awesome, and the quality of the actors make it a much more (forgive me) human story. One thing that is great about the movies, they make the connection between Sauron and the threat realized in the Lord of the Rings that much more immediate and real. They also add a bit of the history before even the Hobbit abvailable to all. One book stretched into three movies makes perfect sense when three books in three movies could have been three books in five or six movies.",1423958400,,734,4.6106870229007635

It was okay as a movie, but having read the books, and thoroughly enjoying the Lord of the Rings trilogy immensely, this one was quite a disappointment.  I got the distinct impression that story lines were added just to stretch one book into three movies.  The Lord of the Rings was actually a trilogy of books, and hence a trilogy of movies made sense.  But to take The Hobbit from one book and make into three movies really didn't cut it for me.  Of course the movie itself is beautifully made, no question about that.  But the content was very thin.",1423785600,,612,4.419642857142857

Tempted by promises of untold gold, a group of filmmakers are lured back to Middle Earth where they magically expand a small novel into three long feature films.

What did I think?

Despite being bloated and excessively drawn out, it turns out the first film of the Hobbit trilogy is actually fun. With familiar characters, backdrops and the obligatory New Zealand tourism shots there is a sense of relaxing into a comfortable chair while watching. Which is fortuitous because its a long movie and feels more like set-up than a story in its own right.

Having said that I have to admit the sense of fun does over-ride the cynicism and negativity. Its enjoyable, interesting and a visual feast. Good characterization combines with a sense of whimsy to provide more comedy than LOTR, which is a fair reflection of the original novel. Im surprised, but it actually is a worthy addition to the franchise*.

* even if the franchise will be unnecessarily long by the end of it.",1423699200,,988,4.754385964912281

You can read the reviews about the story elsewhere. I am only going to

enough that it made me feel that I was on the journey with them.
Hope you have a great sound system because it really adds to the
impact of the movie.

Like the part of the story where Bilbo and company shelter in a cave and are captured in the night by underground trolls.  Plenty scary and visceral in the book, but Jackson has all sorts of crazy scenes in the troll caverns where the company falls from impossible heights, etc. which give it more of a comic book or sci fi feeling.",1423094400,3,692,4.609756097560975

The movie itself is far too long, it's twice as long as the old Hobbit cartoon from the '70s, yet that cartoon hit all the main plot points and this is the first movie out of three?  Jackson's turning the Hobbit into a trilogy is absolutely shameless and this movie deserves the scorn it has been getting from some viewers.

4629813,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let me preface this review by stating that when I saw An Unexpected Journey in the theater, I did not enjoy it. It felt rushed and too polished thanks to the over-abundance of CGI. However, I went ahead and purchased the Extended Edition with the thought that perhaps the extra footage would assuage some of that disappointment that I felt upon my initial viewing of the film. I am happy to report that I really enjoyed the film this time around. There is only an additional 9 minutes of footage but that time does make a difference. It clarified a few things that I didn't quite understand before but I won't go into detail at risk of spoiling it for anyone who has not seen the EE. While this film is full of familiar characters and set in the same space as Lord of the Rings, the tone is much different. It""s definitely much lighter, as is the book, is a bit more fun than its predecessors. I still can't quite get over the necessity for a CG Azog, but it doesn't bother as much anymore.

4629832,2,B0059XTU1S,"There are many reasons why I watched the 'Hobbit'. Mainly among them was a desire to see such a cherished story come to life.

Perhaps the 'Lord of the Rings' provided me with an unrealizable expectation which I brought to this movie. I thought the movie would have a grim tone to it. I expected a seriousness of both mood and setting. I was wrong.

The Hobbit embraces musical numbers, that involve jolly ridiculous acts and massacre any image of true seriousness that the movie could have portrayed. The Dwarf song at Bag End, and the perfectly orchestrated feats of acrobatics and skill, were generally 'Ok'. Though, I admit ... possibly excessive.

The ""Goblin Town"" song, with that ridiculous ""Great Goblin"" was so out of character and wrong that I've tried to ignore its existence to this day.

The voice acting of the movie took a dive with that ""Great Goblin"". It had a grating, whinny and very human tone that made me cringe. The hilarity and ridiculous special effects involved in that entire ""Goblin Town"" sequence was, in a word, awful. For that, if for nothing else, this movie simply is a failure to the spirit (if technically representative) of Tolkien's 'The Hobbit'.",1422057600,,1183,4.784313725490196

4629854,4,B0059XTU1S,"""An Unexpected Journey"" is the first film in the Hobbit trilogy, an adaptation of the Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It follows Bilbo Baggins as he gets a visit from Gandalf the Grey, who persuades him to go on a quest with thirteen dwarves to reclaim their homeland, by the name of Erebor in the Lonely Mountain.

First off, the film is really slow at the start. While it is great to see some familiar places and faces (like Frodo, for instance), it does drag a bit when you realize that it takes 45 minutes for them to finally leave Bag End. I do believe this could have been part of a 2-part film, but to each his own, I suppose.

The cast does amazing, as they used to. Returning actors include Ian McKellen, who is still great as Gandalf, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, who does a fantastic job in the role once more, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. The new actors of note are Martin Freeman as Bilbo, whom in my opinion is the best person they could have chosen, and Richard Armitage as Thorin, who's character definitely gets even better in future installments.

The music, as in Lord of the Rings, is fantastic. Howard Shore may have left the world for seven years, but he returns as if he has never left. Everything else is great as well. The plot, the characters, the cinematography, the effects, amazing.

Once I own the last film on Blu-Ray, I intend to do a Middle-Earth Marathon. Just because this film was a bit less than I expected, doesn't mean I don't love it. 4/5.",1421884800,3,1499,4.44

4629912,3,B0059XTU1S,"`The Hobbit' is one of the first books I read and then immediately re-read (seven times) many, many years ago as a child and was my introduction to Middle Earth and the whole Fantasy genre. I was somewhat dubious about how Peter Jackson would interpret what is, essentially, a 240'ish page children's book; how would he turn this simple little tale into three epic films?

The answer is... by adding loads of stuff that doesn't happen, pointless action sequences and messing about unnecessarily with things that do happen just to add a bit of cinematic impact. The result is, effectively, the opposite of `The Lord of the Rings' where Jackson again messed about a bit with events and left out important things but, despite my early purist grumblings, the end result was well paced, engrossing and a fine dramatisation of a classic tale. Conversely, `The Hobbit part I' is a painfully sluggish and drawn-out LotR prequel with no identity of its own. The visual effects are, of course, stunning, Weta Workshops have again done Tolkien proud and the casting was, on the whole, spot-on (although I never see Martin Freeman without thinking back to `Love Actually' and Hugo Weaving will always be Agent Smith).

As is evident, I was not overly impressed although probably not to the point of not watching the next instalments. If I watch them as if I'd never read the book and have a few drinks then perhaps the forthcoming events in Mirkwood, Dale and at the Lonely Mountain will keep the tale bowling along (please!!).",1421452800,,1515,4.823076923076923

A bunch of cameos and an actor playing Bilbo who isn't the best choice and I really like Marty Freeman. At times the characters and the emotion get caught in the storyline, that's so involved with itself. Had the Hobbit 2 and/or 3 had been better I think I would have maybe would have given this one a pass, because it is part of a bigger story. It didn't have as many interesting action sequences as the 2nd & 3rd ones did. It got three stars because of the usual beautiful cinematography, interesting characters, and interesting story. It was a story that was told better when I read it at seven years old. Nonetheless, this movie will go down in history as being the group of movies Peter Jackson sold us after he came out with that awesome Lord of the Rings trilogy.",1421280000,,937,4.390804597701149

The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey is the first in the 3-part story that leads up to the 3-part Lord of the Rings chronologically, and since they came out backwards it is hard to grasp the sequence of events on first viewing unless you are really paying attention or maybe read the books, but this does not get in the way of enjoying each and every one of them as a stand-alone film, full of great special effects, interesting characters and story, and nicely plotted.  For relatively long films, I have to admit that I never got bored if the action slowed down like is so often the case with many films, especially longer ones.

When I heard that a movie was being made on my favorite book, I was ecstatic.

Then I saw the movie for the first time and disappointment filled my heart. I will say this, the more I watch the movie, the more I come to enjoy it, but that doesn't excuse them from filling it with enough padding to make a Trilogy.

Delving into Tolkien's excess material is great, except when you use it to create a villain for a movie based on a book that didn't really have an overarching villain. Azog is dead. He's been dead for decades before the Hobbit even takes place.

Fellowship of the Ring introduced Lurtz. He killed Boromir, and Aragorn fought him and slew him at Amon Hen in the films climax. I was ok with that. Was Lurtz in the book? No. But he introduced a villain who could challenge our foes on a more personal level than the mindless orcs or Uruk-Hai.

After LOTR, who could resist exploiting Tolkien's other book in the mythos? LOTR movies are admittedly long, and so I guess it only makes sense to make the Hobbit films equally as painstakingly long.

In doing that, the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has many scenes in which seemed to be prolongated. This is different from British TV shows and films where scenes scenes seem to be longer than American movies, and have good reason. The Hobbit's elongated scenes, in my mind, seem so simply to reach that long runtime so you get your money's worth.

Whether dwarves are throwing plates and singing songs, or Jackson and company are playing on the audience's love for nostalgia as the opening sequence and ending sequence has *sigh* Frodo, and we're living in 2001 LOTR again.. I dock this movie a star for the sake of just showing footage to just show footage. There were a lot of scenes (and maybe a few plot points) that just aren't necessary.

4630037,3,B0059XTU1S,"An entertaining return to Middle Earth, with many of the familiar faces from the LOTR film ages ago. It's interesting how they bridged the two films, although I really got puzzled with where the story was going, or what the deal was with subplots involving the wizard Radagast and the rabbit sled thing (although, to be fair, I loved seeing Sylvester McCoy on the screen, as he was my favorite of all of the Doctors).
As far as the film, the story is comfusing (are the menaces being talked about related to Mordor and Sauron or something else?) and most of the characters are forgettable and sadly the film gets a little too carried away with special effects (namely the horrendously CGI goblin sequences). And how did they manage to survive falling on broken bridges through hundreds of feet, or no one winds up injured from the rockem and sockem battling rock giants?
The production is good and the film looks fantastic, but they got a little too carried away with the special effects this time.",1420675200,,998,4.676136363636363

The story is great and what i really like about the extended edition is the appendices you get with the movie. The appendices are documentaries about the making of the film. The coolest part is they continue on from the LOTR movies. So each movie gets to so LOTR had appendices 1-6 and the Hobbit had 7 and 8. Awesome movie and how doesnt want more hobbits in your life",1420588800,,512,4.181818181818182

4630057,1,B0059XTU1S,"This rendering of the Hobbit to film completely replaces the beloved tale for one that is commercially viable for large video game profits. The director's public evisceration of The author's work is just another example of corporate short-term gain at the expense of long venerated publications. He has managed to transform high fantasy literature into a roller coaster ride to mediocrity. It is apparent that the studio executives thought of the audience as nothing more than a dull-witted goblin horde that would consume anything placed before it.

Read the book instead over a second breakfast. A walk in the woods afterward would give an unclouded appreciation of Tolkien's poetic masterpiece.

The truly stupid thing is, I was able to buy an HDMI to VGA adapter for about $20 which allowed my PC and projector to satisfy the HDCP requirement of this disk (and the update of my player program required to play it).  I've never downloaded a pirated movie and will never upload a pirated movie.  I don't buy that many movies but I believe in paying for what I want to have.  I also believe in keeping my equipment and continuing to use it as long as it still performs well (which is why I don't yet have a projector with HDMI input even though my 5-year-old, home-built, tower PC has HDMI out).  The fact that I could overcome this anti-piracy scheme for $20 just made it an unnecessary hassle and clearly will NOT stop piracy.

4630168,3,B0059XTU1S,"How much you like the Hobbit series (including the third movie at theaters currently) depends greatly on your answers to two questions:
 1.  How well did Jackson and the writers change a relatively short and simple quest into a much, much longer story that serves as a fuller introduction to the mythology and events in Lord of the Rings.  Personally, I think this is an impossible task because the plot of the Hobbit cannot bear the increased metaphorical weight and the greatly extended time on the screen.  This is especially true because Lord of the Rings succeeded so brilliantly.  Still, people may disagree.
2.  How fatiguing do you find another ten hours of movie with a similar settings, similar visual style, similar plot devices and tropes, similar battles, the same villains, similar heroes etc. even when you loved them the first fifty times you watched them in Lord of the Rings?  Personally, I found them quite fatiguing at times despite Jackson and the writer's attempts to change things up, but people who have not watched LOR as much as I have or have shorter memories may well disagree.
  I just wish Jackson had limited himself to the basic story in the book and a shorter movie (3-5 hours at most).  Yet there are surprising and powerful scenes, especially in the last movie of this trilogy.",1420243200,,1312,4.791111111111111

There was almost no character development, and the plot development is painfully slow.  It quite literally put me to sleep.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that Gollum is a spectacular bit of CGI, the best scene in the movie by far.

I first read the Lord of The Rings when I was about 30 (Now 76) and The Hobbit a few years later when I bought a very well illustrated version. Could not count the number of times I have read it since then or watched the LOTR. How sad to make such a juvenile story out of what is an adult story.,1420156800,,555,3.8771929824561404

Now the bad : the battle scenes were tedious, a rehash of the Lord of the Rings battle, except much, much worse. The battles are go on and on and on. What made it so bad for me is that I couldn't get excited over them because they were so utterly stupid: hundreds of 7' muscular monsters, armor plated, with huge weapons, being wiped out by a handful of individuals with no armor and ranging in size from 3' to 6' with average muscles ( including one old man gasping for breath); instead of swords they could have used shoelaces and it would have been the same result. And then . . . . The outcome of the battle is left up in the air--- what happened? Yes, I know they won, but how, when, what happened. And then there was the long drawn out nervous breakdown of Thorin--- tedious. I just could not get involved and could not care less who lived or died.

Still love it, still love Tolkein!",1419465600,2,298,4.245614035087719
4630420,5,B0059XTU1S,"Here begins the tale of the finding of the one ring of power.  Blah, blah, blah...  Some, it seems are a bit challenged with the idea of lengthening a film feature that has already expanded a single book into three feature length films.

To begin with, Peter Jackson's movies are not J.R.R. Tolkien's books.  Telling the stories on film involves a great deal more than simply looking gorgeous.  Now that all three Hobbit movies are released, it's appropriate I believe, to reflect on how the most altered element of all was converting over the narrator's P.O.V. (point of view).  The narrator of the book is the Hobbit himself.  But the movie presumes to display the events which generated the narrative.  By the time the last movie rolls out, Bilbo's narrative conversation with himself doesn't exist any longer.  The illustrations are completed.  But that doesn't mean Tolkien's word crafting has been discarded.

It was the Hobbit who became ""fed up with dwarves"" after they reclaimed Erebor -- The Lonely Mountain, in the book.  Likewise, the hoarding instinct evinced by Thorin when their home is reclaimed was exactly what motivated Bilbo's narrative ire and desertion to the elven camp with the Arkenstone.

Again, with the movies, it's Gandalf (during the Unexpected Journey) cursing the pride of dwarves/their downfall, as he stomps out of the camp of the ruined farmer's house.  On maps and in the calendars that site later became known as the Trollshaws.  Understandably, it's the previously developed movie character Gandalf from LOTR movies who now must script for us a tid-bit at a time, Jackson's character sketch of Durin's folk.

Dwarvish character profiles of the novel were un-polished, with but marginal history that Tolkien hadn't yet developed.  It was Bilbo who grew unsympathetic with them in the end, with their appalling disdain for the suffering of Laketown at the fire and claw of the dragon's wrath awakened by the dwarves.  The movies alternatively have generated a company of other characters to narrate the dwarvish background, and dischord with elves that went un-elaborated with the book.

Unexpected Journey presents us with the principle hurdle the screen writers must overcome.  They're tasked with a rather bleak assessment, delivered in deadpan sarcasm by the Goblin King, as Thorin and his captured company are introduced:  ""But wait"", he says to Thorin ""you don't have a mountain"", and ""you're not a king, which makes you NOBODY really.""  (Enter the conspiracy of the ""defiling-days"" of Azog, the pale Orc).  Now Peter Jackson can show us that Thorin and company can still fight for something.  Now they have motivation.  Pretty much from the moment in Imladris, when the White Council gathers, these dwarves have stopped being Tolkien's original literary creatures and have begun to develop into the maturity of his later developed history of Durin's folk.

This extended edition both introduces Silmaril-like ""jewels of pure star-light"", as the bone of contention between dwarves and elves of the dark days, but also plays this out as narrative commentary with Bilbo Baggain's dis-embodied voice commenting on how sad it is when alliances fall and friendships break under the spell of avarice.  To some, it won't matter how much more mature a Hobbit story has evolved.  But to others, we are refreshed through having spent time with the skillful story teller.",1419465600,8,3402,5.125226860254084

4630542,4,B0059XTU1S,"More than seventy years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a story called ""The Hobbit"", in which the title character somehow gets mixed up with a bunch of dwarves to reclaim missing treasure. The success and acclaim of this book led to the highly acclaimed ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which years later was transformed into one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time by Peter Jackson. It was perhaps inevitable that one day Jackson would return to this territory to tackle the trials of Bilbo Baggins, but because this movie follows on the heels of a towering achievement like the LORD OF THE RINGS films, comparisons are bound to be inevitable.

Adding to the burden of the brunt is the controversial decision to extend THE HOBBIT into a trilogy.  That approach worked ideally well for Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but because THE HOBBIT is a considerably shorter book (more like one third of the trilogy), it doesn't really merit the decision for three two-and-a-half hour movies.  A more ideal approach would have been to film the book as a two-part series, not a trilogy.  On a technical level there's nothing majorly wrong with Jackson's direction; the casting and performances are both excellent, the cinematography breathtaking as always, and the visual effects, for the most part, are as impressive as ever.  The problem is that the movies are just too unnecessarily long.

In fact, it takes a whopping 45 minutes to get Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) out of his cozy home in Hobbiton to go out on his fateful quest with the eponymous wizard Gandalf (Ian MacKellen), as well as a pack of dwarves led by a brooding fellow named Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage).  En route, we first see a lengthy, ten-minute prologue in which the old Bilbo (played with a wavering sincerity by Ian Holm) begins writing his book about his adventures, starting with the downfall of the Dwarven city of Erebor.  The subsequent half hour is basically the first chapter, in which Bilbo's quiet humble life is turned upside down when the dwarves intrude into his household and take over his pantry in no time.  The nature of this scene is also noticeably more lighthearted than even the prologue of the first RINGS film, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.  In all fairness, the tone of Tolkien's HOBBIT is more of a children's story and what's on the screen is more or less true to the original, but it also requires a subjective approach.  Fans familiar with the book will get the gist of it and more or less be fine, but for more antsy audience members, it does require patience to sit through this scene.

Extending scenes like this aren't the only aesthetic choices that Jackson chooses to approach when tackling the story to screen.  Sometimes he ends up culling information from the footnotes of Tolkien's fantasy, even borrowing bits of THE SIMILARION for good measure.  For instance, we meet the wizard Radagast, an eccentric fellow who cares for animals and goes around riding on a massive ""rabbit"" sleigh.  There is also a shady backstory involving a conflict between Thorin against a nasty-looking orc named Azgog (a mostly computer-animated villain with a vicious grin and a prosthetic arm).  Finally we get a surprisingly long scene at the Elven city of Rivendell in which Gandalf converses with his colleague, the ill-fated sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee) about the potential return of Sauron.  This is obviously meant to tie THE HOBBIT into THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, which is understandable because this is, after all, a prequel, but again, whether one is willing to sit through such slow scenes depends on the nature.

THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY really comes to life during the bits when it actually sticks to the story.  The sequence where Bilbo and company are captured by giant trolls does justice to the book.  In the second half, we get a scarifying roller-coaster style confrontation with two stone giants (a scene which nailed me to my seat) to a visit to the infamous Goblin City, ruled by a bloated fellow called the Goblin King.  But the film's real highlight is the ""Riddles in the Dark"" sequence, a cunningly choreographed, thrilling confrontation in which Bilbo must outsmart the twisted Gollum (again brought to life by the remarkable motion capture and hoarse voice of Andy Serkis).

Despite the occasional lull in the story, though, I honestly wasn't necessarily bored at all by any of this; I have quite enjoyed Tolkien's stories and I could spend hour after hour in the fantasy world that Jackson still manages to fully realize on the screen, thanks to the luscious sets and aforementioned cinematography.  And unlike George Lucas, who obviously was no great ""actor's director"" when it came to his weaker STAR WARS prequel trilogy, Jackson hasn't lost his ability to extol performances from his cast.  Freeman was practically born to play Bilbo, embuing the character's neurotic reluctance with a charm that easily makes even the slowest parts of the film tolerable to sit through.  Armitage mostly portrays Thorin as a grumpy, dour fellow who doubts his new charge, but he does so with hints of a tortured personality.  Sylvestor McCoy is also quite good as the eccentric Radagast, and the dwarves are all well cast and fitting for their roles.  And of course, it's gratifying to see McKellan, Lee, Serkis, and even Cate Blanchett (as Galadriel) reprise their roles.

On a more controversial move, Jackson chose to shoot this HOBBIT trilogy in High Frame Rate mode, in which the speed of the frames is increased from 24fps to 48fps.  It's a bold, daring move, and in many ways it works quite well for this movie; Middle Earth looks spectacular and rich in its depth with the 3D format, but other times it gives the feel of a super-polished real-life documentary on TV rather than a film.  Having said that, though, the film plays well either way so aside from the frame rate length.

Is this HOBBIT trilogy on par with the original LORD OF THE RINGS?  No.  But it's still well-made and executed with a style that only Jackson can do.  In short, whether you decide that THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is for you depends on how much you are willing to overlook the eccentric decision to extend what is essentially a shorter story and embark on another adventure.  Having said that, though, I still quite enjoyed the movie and if nothing else, it left me eager for the next chapter.",1418947200,25,6415,4.843406593406593

Why 3 Stars for the Extended version? There are 13 extra minutes; most of the extra time is given over to Peter Jacksons over-the-top grotesqueries. For example  dwarves pilfering silverware from Rivendell or skinny-dipping in the fountains there. Really? Then there is the full song-and-dance sequence by the Goblin King. Really gripping stuff. Theres a clumsy bit of exposition where Gandalf and Elrond are talking and they are overheard by Bilbo and Thorin. Cut it and you don't miss it. The only things I found useful were about 30 secs of character development for Bilbo and the source of the original quarrel with the Wood Elves. You don't need an Extended edition for those.

But hey, if you want the directors commentary (which is quite good) and all the extra features, you have to put up with Peter Jackson skirting around the responsible adults on his writing team (Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh) and the resulting blemishes in an otherwise excellent movie.

If only the Extended version had a Skip button for all of Peter Jacksons excesses, then wed have it all  great movie, good commentaries and great extra features, and we could choose whether or not to sit through poor judgments in storytelling. That would be a 5-Star Extended version.  (FYI  Ive seen both versions of The Desolation of Smaug and strongly recommend the Extended movie over the theatrical version. Great extra minutes there add much to the second film in the trilogy.)

All that said, the movie (whichever version you buy) is a treat, and this film will stand the test of time. In 50 years I strongly doubt it will be surpassed. The scenery, the cinematography, the writing, the sound mix, the art acting and special effects are all outstanding. Getting this devotion to quality storytelling with this much imagination may come only once in a generation. Weve been blessed that with Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, its come twice in a relatively short period.

My final quibble with both movies is the tiny, tiny credits at the end for John Howe and Alan Lee, whose art has been hugely influential in the realization of Middle Earth, its lands and its peoples for Hobbit and LOTR.

4630764,2,B0059XTU1S,"How terribly sad. I really enjoyed Peter Jackson's approach to the Lord of the Rings, but the ham-fisted, over the Hollywood-top treatment of Tolkien's The Hobbit is too much to bear. I began counting the times that this movie seriously deviated from the original story line, then stopped after I ran out of fingers (not even an hour into the movie). I'm sure there is a reason why Mr. Jackson sold out, but it doesn't make the first part of this trilogy any easier to watch. It's now just another special-effect-packed, booming, raucous piece of tinsel town trash. Just to be clear, I thought the acting and actors were top drawer, but my first clue should have come right at the beginning when the opening credits state that the film is ""Based"" on the book The Hobbitand very loosely I might add.",1417305600,,798,4.626760563380282
4630765,1,B0059XTU1S,"My mom likes to tell the story of the time I was five years old and got so excited about Halloween I didn't sleep for a week beforehand.  Predictably, on Halloween night itself, I lasted about a block before falling asleep and needing to be carried home.

I guess I haven't learned much in the past forty-three years.

For some time, I've been looking forward to the film adaptation of The Hobbit.  With all the delays, contractual wrangles, directorial switches, and so forth, I've been kept in a state of nervous agitation for what seems like years.  And now that the movie's out and I've finally seen it, I have this to report:

It stunk.

Oh, there were a couple good parts: the riddle contest had a kind of menacing intensity, and the representation of Thorin Oakenshield, though not at all like the picture in my head of an elderly, stately dwarf, actually worked really well.  And Cate Blanchett was absolutely ravishing as Galadriel, so that was a plus.

Other than that, though, the film was lame, lame, lame.  Here's why:

1. Blockbuster Bloat.  Tolkien's novel may be the prequel to the much more sweeping epic of The Lord of the Rings, but The Hobbit itself is a small, domestic, homely tale (I use all these words with positive connotations, as did Tolkien).  Blowing this story up to not one but three three-hour movies, with endless epic battle scenes, CGI-heavy chase sequences, and 3D-friendly roller-coaster rides made no sense whatsoever (unless, of course, all you care about is making a buck).  I'd have thought Jackson, who was once a director who cared about quality, would have disdained making a movie that cares only about quantity.  But I guess once you become a blockbuster director, the things you care about change.

2. Dwarf Droppings.  In his essay ""On Fairy-Stories,"" Tolkien famously defines fantasy as the act of creating a ""Secondary World,"" with its own rules, logic, and internal consistency.  It's okay, he says, to have magical things, impossible things, in this Secondary World--so long as you don't change the rules in midstream.  I quote Tolkien:

""What really happens [in fantasy] is that the story-maker proves a successful 'sub-creator.'  He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter.  Inside it, what he relates is 'true': it accords with the laws of that world.  You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside.  The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or art, has failed.  You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside.""

This is, alas, precisely what happens in Jackson's film.  I can accept goblins, hobbits, wizards, trolls, and all that stuff--but I can't accept human beings (or even dwarves) dropping five hundred feet on a rickety wooden platform, then being squashed by a two-ton monster, and walking away unscathed.  That's not one of the rules of Tolkien's Secondary World: dwarves are mortal, and (though hardy) breakable, so you can't do any darn thing you please with them for the sake of a really cool computer-generated shot.  But Jackson has shown himself willing to do just that in many of his recent big-budget movies, as in King Kong, where regular human beings roll around on the back of giant dinosaurs with nary a nick or scratch.  It's big, loud, dumb movie-making, and it destroys the credibility of the whole enterprise.

3. Gore, Gore, and More Gore.  The Hobbit was written for children.  The film version was made for the audience that every blockbuster film is made for these days: teenage boys (and their hapless dates). So you've got to have beheadings, impalings, amputations, incinerations, and everything else that, for some inexplicable reason, teenage boys consider really, really cool.  (My guess is they'd find it less cool if it were happening to them, but that's another story.)  Once again, in the interest of marketability, Jackson has decided to violate the spirit and substance of Tolkien's book.

4. Been There, Done That.  I loved The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy--but I don't need to see constant homages to it in The Hobbit.  Same score, same dramatic moments, same lines, same actors (including Elijah Wood and Ian Holm in particularly unfortunate and meaningless opening cameos where they try to play the parts they originally played when they were ten years younger).  Even the great Ian McKellen was rather tired and obvious as Gandalf: he's done it so well before, all he could do was repeat himself here.  In retrospect, it's a shame that Guillermo Del Toro backed out of the project and Jackson took over; a fresh interpretation might have worked better than a retread.  It might not, however, have made as much money, and I guess, in the end, that's what it's all about.

So in sum, I wish I'd learned my lesson from age five.  I'd have been a lot better off sleeping through this one.",1417305600,42,4893,4.851628468033776

4630770,2,B0059XTU1S,"First of all, lets be clear that this review is not about the movie but the hardware ( DVDs) that I bought because I loved the movie in the theater. The DVDs were shipped to me from New Jersey. It wasn't packed the way generally amazon packs stuff. It was packed in a flimsy paper bag which was taped around. I had ordered two DVDs. 1. Unexpected Journey and 2. Desolation of Samug.
The first DVD started skipping in first 20 minutes. I thought it was my XBOX 1 Blue ray player, so I switched to my LG blu ray player and it skipped there as well. After couple of hick ups within first first 30 minutes, the movie ran fine. After that, I opened DVD.2 and found out that the plastic hing that DVD holder clamps on to is broken. So when you open the DVD box, you should see several DVDs arrange in a book fashion with a hing that supports flipping DVD pages from one to another, mine was broken ( could it be the flimsy packing, I don't know). When I ran DVD.2 it ran fine.  Overall I am not happy with the DVDs, again I love the movies but the review is not about the movie. If you want to review or see the review of the movies, please go on imdb or rotten tomatoes. Anyways, will return it on Monday.",1417132800,,1200,4.084745762711864
4630781,3,B0059XTU1S,"A very slow movie. Looking at the special features gave me an idea that the director's job is limited to a minimun, or should I see expanded to a maximum, more like a coordinator of many groups, and each group has its own coordinator. Movies like this are not so much about directing great performances or putting provocative ideas on film as finishing all the special effects to meet a deadline. Certainly it was pretty to look at and I used to go crazy for this kind of movies when I was at college, but now I just find it tasteless.",1417046400,,535,4.306930693069307

Tolkien combine their genius to create this next installment in the cinematic triumph that is THE LORD OF THE RINGS/ HOBBIT TRILOGY. Jackson uses the epic to fill in all the missing pieces and it is a thrill to visit those places and characters we know so well from the first LORD OF THE RINGS! I especially enjoy the childlike fun of the Gandalf, Bilbo, and Dwarves as they fight their way through the Goblin caves, keeping in the spirit of the original book that was written for young people.

The thing I don't like is that they took one movie worth of content, added some extra stuff, and tossed it all into three movies.  On the other hand, three movies gives us more time to spend with the characters and series, which is always good.  I'm not going to say it's just a cash grab because it is still worth the money.

I would wait to see this one until the others are finished so you can watch them all together. it doesn't really have enough content to make you feel like it was worth sitting through. All of the good parts were cut until the next movies.",1415664000,,638,4.129032258064516

4630952,2,B0059XTU1S,"Spoiler alert: I am a lifelong Tolkien fan and have scholarly interest in Tolkien's work as a literary critic and a translator. I am currently teaching ""The Hobbit"" to college freshmen. I had not seen the first or second Peter Jackson Hobbit films in the theater, due mainly to life circumstances. I was absolutely enchanted by Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, even having just re-read Tolkien's trilogy and Christopher's additional editions in anticipation of the films.

Realizing that my students had mostly seen ""An Unexpected Journey"" in the theaters, I bought the extended version out of curiosity; I had also long meant to view it. And I could not bring myself to watch more than an hour of it. I am an excellent binge watcher, and an avid binge reader of at least Tolkien, but I was so disappointed with Jackson's version it could not hold my attention.

I will say, it's not the fidelity issue. Or rather, the fact of the insertion of swaths of narratives from the Appendices or Unfinished Tales isn't in itself problematic. I don't even mind the creation of a non-Tolkien sourced love story between an Elf and Dwarf. The ""love"" or lack thereof of those two peoples in general is a central to both ""The Hobbit"" and, made patent in the developing respect and affection between Legolas and Gimli in the trilogy (a ""love"" most certainly explicated by Tolkien).

The thing that makes ""The Hobbit"" an utterly fantastic tale, that sets it above other ""fairy stories"" of our generation, for children or otherwise, is its patience. To begin a journey that will someday lead to the last and greatest battle of a waning age, between all the forces of supreme evil and the collective forces of good, with the line ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit"" is the stuff of an excellent story-teller. ""The Hobbit"" as a novel only peripherally deals with the grand themes, and is utterly un-cinematic in it's patience and guarded hand. The subtlety of the work is one of its most enduring features. This is eviscerated in the film.

Surely, had the film executed this with more grace and less schlock, as a film it might have worked nonetheless. An amalgamation of various strands of the ""back story"" to fill a 3-part prequel to a franchise can also be awesome. To have this be constructed though in the framework of Bilbo's adventure to Eridor is pretty arbitrary, though, as that particular narrative as written doesn't help us understand that much, except the ""chance"" of the theft of the ring, the ending of the hostilities between the northern peoples, the identification of Sauron--although, no, that only sort of, since it is only tangential to Bilbo's quest. Why not a grand blockbuster about the downfall of the Numenor or the Last Alliance or the Battle of Dargolad or Isildur's drowning? Or just about Dwarves, their creation, their pride, Moria, Durin's Bane, etc. etc.",1415059200,,2885,4.810483870967742

4631064,2,B0059XTU1S,"14 points, for the fourteen companions, for a review of the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (based on Mr. Tolkien's book The Hobbit or There and Back Again).

1. I will try not to spoil the movie for you. If you don't want to take that chance, stop reading now.

2. I believe that if you use source material and claim the same name, that you should be accurate in your interpretation. I give allowance for abridgment, as is necessary. Just bear that in mind too.

3. I went into The Hobbit expecting little resemblance to the book at all. In that, thankfully, I was not entirely correct, and so was a little relieved.

4. I disagree with Jackson making The Hobbit into 3 movies. If Lord of the Rings gets 3 movies, The Hobbit ought to get 1. Que sera sera.

5. The Hobbit is NOT a prequel to the Lord of the Rings. It is a prelude. Jackson apparently doesn't understand that difference, and is bent on making The Hobbit trilogy a prequel to Lord of the Rings. That means forcing information from the LotR appendices into The Hobbit movies. Don't agree, but I understand.

6. The Hobbit (book) is not an epic like the LotR books are. The Hobbit (book) is a lark. It's an adventure. Its focus is on Bilbo. While there is a point to his and the dwarves journeying, it is not a quest in the way LotR was. It was not intended to be that. It was a small band of homeless dwarves attempting the impossible ... the fate of the world did not change if they succeeded or failed.

Not so in the movie. Yes, there are adventures along the way of the adventure, BUT the book was light-hearted. The movie is serious. The movie thinks it is LotR. The movie feels like it is supposed to be LotR. Maybe it does feel that way, but to me it felt off because it felt epic. Because it's not supposed to be epic.

In the very beginning of the movie they come really close to the feel of the book, but then they decidedly do not continue in that light-hearted vein. A pity, really. Thankfully, the scene of the meeting of the dwarves and Bilbo is pretty accurate, for a movie.

7. I do wish all the dwarves had been properly introduced at the beginning of the film. All of their names are thrown out there attached to them at some point during the movie (I think), but it's really hard to keep them separated in the mind. Maybe I'll have it figured by the third movie.

8. The movie is NOT about Bilbo. It should not be named The Hobbit. I think a better suited titled would be ""Thorin: Azog's Prey"" or ""Thorin: The Homeless King"" or ""Thorin: The Journey Home"", as the movie is obviously about the Dwarf King.

9. Since Azog came up, what's he doing in the movie? He has a passing mention in the book. One time. In ancient history. He is not supposed to be pursuing them and it adds nothing to the movie. The movie would flow just find without his presence. Besides, he's horribly CG -distractingly so.

10. Speaking of horribly CG ... was it just me, or did more things in The Hobbit seem CG than in the LotR? Azog. The goblins. The Wargs (or maybe they just looked less real because their mounts looked less real... namely Azog). I mean, in LotR they used a lot of masks. Masks that were not CG, which means they were made and had to therefore look real. Why couldn't they have done that again?

The eagles didn't look terrific (though my husband thinks they look better than in LotR. Maybe they do, I'm not sure. But I didn't look at them in LotR and go ""oh they're obviously CG"", even though I knew they were.)

The trolls. Deeper voices might have helped them look more realistic. The high voices coming out of the big trolls just wasn't working for me.

Some of the landscape. I don't know if they used more CG for where the company traveled for not. I'm inclined to say they did because...

11. of the unnatural zooming that took place. In Dale, for instance. When we're zooming through the town overhead and then in the middle of and then back to the rooftops it didn't feel like something you could do with a camera, but it felt like something easily done in a 3-D model. That doesn't help with realism. It happened a few other times in the movie too. ... And some of the time I felt that everything was out of focus and I didn't know where to look.

Thankfully, those times didn't last long, but they did happen. That's unfortunate.

12. Why the deep-seated hatred against Elves by Thorin? Totally not there in the book. At all. Can't find it. They explain it in the movie, but it's completely fabricated.

13. As is the harshness against Bilbo by the dwarves, particularly Thorin. Ok, so the dwarves grumble about Bilbo after they escape from the goblins under the mountain (in the book) it is waaaayyy drummed up throughout the whole movie.

14. I believe they lifted more lines straight out of the book this movie than they did in LotR, even if the wrong person said them in the movie. I appreciated that, and hope that is something that continues in the remaining two movies.

So there you have it. What do I think? I think there were several things they got right in the movie, which was more than I expected. There was a lot I would've done differently, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie. I did. And I am curious as to how the remaining two movies turn out.

And in spite of the things I've pointed out about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (and I haven't said all I good, for good or ill), and the skepticism I bring to the remaining two movies, I am looking forward to seeing them. After all, when you expect the worst, you can really only be pleasantly surprised when things don't turn out quite so bad. And maybe, just maybe I'll keep learning how to separate books and movies in my mind.",1413331200,3,5708,4.334896810506566

I was so impressed, astonished, BLOWN AWAY by the quality, accuracy and reality of the 3D images that I went back and re-purchased this movie in 3D as well.

Well, it seems to me as if they may have made some advances in 3D technology that were implemented during the time between the production and issuance of these two movies.  The 3D effect was noticeably less pleasing and was a bit uneven, and although it was adequate and amusing at whiles, it was nothing like the consistent impression of reality in ""The Desolation of Smaug.""

I will not address the content.

What if you haven't yet? Should you return to Middle Earth one more time with the prequel story? If you enjoyed the previous trilogy, then the answer is obviously a yes.  Like Fellowship of the Ring, this will probably be my favorite of the trilogy because I love how it starts and I love how it ends with that ""the journey is far from over"" message. Once again I find myself in awe of Peter Jackson's and WETA's production team presentation with this movie's fantastic settings and numerous colorful characters of An Unexpected Journey. I usually love dwarves in most fantasy settings. I find them more interesting than typically athletic and beautiful elves. I'm not going to lie, but that is one of the main reasons why I loved this movie. Each Dwarf looks and has a unique personality that I can't take my eyes off when on screen. We all know how Jackson does like to draw out parts in and out the book, but there are certain moments where I was in complete fantasy nerd heaven. I'm so glad he wanted to elaborate on the dwarf history parts. It's as if Peter Jackson knew that Warhammer nerds like me would want to splatter that type of imagery of orcs and dwarves in an amazing hate relationship with such emotional expression. To this date, I doubt anything is going to capture what I thought was entirely impossible to film. Even the return to familiar settings like Hobbiton and Rivendell brought that feeling of fantasy escape rushed back to me like I did when watching the first LOTR movie back in 2002. And little things that I remember from reading the book somehow made it in anyway. I ended up enjoying the hell out this film. Even dwarves singing (yes, they actually did sing in the books) somehow made it into this movie and it was wonderful to watch.

Now, the real question is what version you should buy of An Unexpected Journey. Unless you are a completion-ist that has to have every scene and every special feature for each entry (i.e. me) then this should be your choice. However, I have a reason I knocked a star off of this review. For nostalgic reasons, this edition did not feel like an extended edition such as the previous LOTR movie. For starters, the actual movie case doesn't have that old timey book feel like the original trilogy DVD versions. Here we get a character insert picture no matter what as if it was a typical bu-ray cover you find anywhere in a retail store. The extra minuets added to the film are barely noticeable with not real new emphasis to have you go ""whoa! This is a brand new scene altogether! Or ""holy crap! That's awesome they added that in!"" One scene is either hit or miss depending on your humor level. I like anything that displays how dwarves feel about elves and I laughed regardless, but for some, yeah I can kind of see why it was pointless. As much as I liked the singing in the movie, I could have done without the Goblin king's. It sounded better on paper, but you can see why they decided to leave it out.

Overall, this is a nice package to buy if you do not have An Unexpected Journey yet. If you just need the first entry for movie narrative sake, you could honestly just skip on this and purchase the theatrical version. However, if you are a fan, then this should already be in your movie collection. The only thing that would have sweetened the deal, is if it came with a DVD copy.

Nerd moments for the rest of this review:
This movie was met with a mixed bag of disappointment or content. I can understand a few of the gripes like it takes too long to get things started, maybe parts not originally in the book were elaborated too much, that certain something is missing to what made reading the Hobbit so special. But you know what? The reason I liked this movie as much as I did was due that I knew what I was getting myself into. Even when I watched this in the theater, the DVD theatrical release, and the extended Blu-Ray version, I still find myself enjoying an Unexpected Journey quite a bit...almost more than Fellowship of the Ring. I was already used to Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord of the Rings. In fact, I'm glad he wanted to pick up the pieces and finish what Guillermo del Toro started.  They did the same exact thing with the previous trilogy, so why not? And to be honest from a business side with WB, it was probably the smarter choice. Instead of 1 movie to tie it all together, why not push it into an epic trilogy format that has a strong beginning, darker middle, and the defining end to it all?.... Of course the irony of that statement comes crashing into a wall with the last segment of Desolation of Smaug... but let's not get there yet.

But what I cannot understand is how anybody would want to compare this movie to the much loathed Episode 1: The Phantom Menace for the Star Wars franchise. I'm sorry, but I think you are ignorant if you think so. Why? Because this movie can actually be watched without feeling embarrassed about piss poor dialogue, nonexistent acting, and terrible use of CGI. I promise you the parts with Radagast the brown are leagues beyond whatever the #$&% Lucas and company were trying to achieve with Jar Jar Binks. Even though there is a heavier use of CGI and green screen in this title than compared to the LOTR trilogy, it is still a fun and beautiful movie to watch. So much effort was put into this and this is just the first part of the Hobbit movie trilogy. Yes, it can feel bloated and it drags on, but at least it's interesting bloat and drag. Not, ""oh my god, the magic is dead"" reaction so many of us felt with each Star Wars prequel. Hey, imdb.com and rottentomatoes.com's ratings speak the truth. In my opinion, an Unexpected Journey will probably be the strongest out of the whole trilogy. It's not as strong as Fellowship of the Ring, as most will tell you. But if I have to return to the world of Middle Earth for a prequel, then I prefer it this way.",1412899200,7,6078,4.441756272401434

4631100,5,B0059XTU1S,"I had already purchased the DVD ""extended edition"", which did not, as it turned out, have all the advertised additional features. Having bought a Blue-ray player, I wanted to see how the Blue-ray version stacked up. I discovered through shopping and reading reviews that Blue-ray versions nearly always have more stuff on them than the DVDs.

That is very true in this case, although there was not nearly as much as had been included with the Lord of the Rings extended versions. Still, if you want the full experience of the additional scenes and extended takes, this is the item. You will not be disappointed.

As always with Amazon purchases, shipping is very prompt. Since I have experienced no problems with any of my own Amazon buys, I have nothing to report about customer service.",1412899200,,788,4.82962962962963
4631111,2,B0059XTU1S,"For all the time and money that went into making this movie, I was astonished at its ""B movie"" or even ""1960's Japanese horror movie"" look and feel.  JRRT must be revolving in his grave over this.

The characters were not believable, did not evoke anything related to the book (""based on the book"" indeed!), and the character design, especially of the dwarves, did not even manage to reach the (much better) clothing and makeup of the Munchkins in the original Wizard of Oz.  The ""hair-and-beard"" styles were preposterous and embarrassingly close to cheap ""Santa Claus"" beard fluff.  Hey guys, there is plenty of real human hair wig material out there....or you could use the tails of some of the horses that met their deaths while making this movie!

And oh, the Wargs!  The Wargs!  Honestly, I have never seen such lousy papier-mache work since....since....oh, give me a while, I'll remember it someday.  And then there was the tip-of-the-hat to the nasty old Star Wars fatty, the head of the Dali-esque but SO overdone goblin kingdom--sorry, didn't catch his name but I DID like the concept of the beard made out of globby fat.  In fact I was fascinated with it and played it back a couple of times.

On a positive note, Gollum turned out to be spectacular.  If the whole movie had had the quality of movement, expression, animation, and character development that went into Gollum, I would be watching this movie over and over and giving it six stars.

Unfortunately, Gollum was the only character who had more than four or five facial expressions (I would list them here but I fall asleep every time I make a start at it).",1412899200,,1627,4.690140845070423

4631239,2,B0059XTU1S,"So many hopes were attached to this movie. Would it be as compelling as the LOTR trilogy?

The short answer is ""No"".

Here is why: First, it is not a bad movie. I watched the whole film through and only yawned once and made popcorn once. But, the standard in which this is held to is the debut movies of the series. Specifically, the ""Fellowship of the Ring"". Whereas Fellowship presents itself as a story, much like a book, The Hobbit enters like a sequel. That is a significant problem. Especially since it does not match well with either the Book, The Hobbit, nor does it match up well with Fellowship.
The ""jump the shark"" moment is truly when the Goblin king pulls a Jar Jar bink/Digital Cantina singer moment and he sings like it is a musical. Lets open ""Film School"" for the director:
It is a tense moment. Our protagonists are captured. Facing death. and Stupido the Goblin starts singing like it was a number from Grease. Never mind that the digital ""CGI"" looks like a video game.....it is so farcical, that I had to fast forward past the part.
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? Maybe George Lucas got his hands on the film.....
Anyway, I am going to watch it again and see if I can find the redeeming quality here. But, you get ONE chance to get movies like this right. They hit LOTR out of the park. Why dumb-down The Hobbit?",1411257600,,1327,4.412244897959184

4631306,5,B0059XTU1S,"It begins with an older Bilbo telling Frodo the whole story about his adventure
set just before his birthday party in The Lord of Rings.  Gandalf visits Bilbo
Baggins and asks him to go on an adventure.  However Gandalf doesn't
tell him that he will be a burglar and that they would be traveling with
a band of dwarves.  As they began their journey, they meet trolls,
goblins, Gollum, go to Rivendell where they meet Elrond, and Radagast the
Brown as they journey to the Misty Mountains to reclaim their homeland.
Must watch!

4631324,5,B0059XTU1S,"I first saw the preview for The Hobbit when I saw Journey 2 in theaters, and I didn't know what to think. I had seen Lord of the Rings, but I didn't find them that exciting, because they had too much war, and not enough peril. I loved the 2003 Hobbit video game, and that was my vision of the Hobbit.
 My sisters saw the preview for the Hobbit when they went to see Brave, and they had a totally different reaction. They knew right away that they had to see it.
 So, on New Years Eve, my sisters saw the Hobbit in theaters, and they loved it. My younger sister instantly decided it was her favorite movie, and highly encouraged the rest of the family to see it.
 Well, we did see it on Valentines Day two and a half months later, and it was not what I had expected at all. Like I said earlier The Hobbit video game was my The Hobbit. Furthermore, it hardly could even be compared to Lord of the Rings. It caught me completely off guard.
 But after the movie, I knew something else. The next time I watched it, I was prepared, and it was decided. It was probably my favorite movie of all time.
 First of all, Martin Freeman did a perfect job for Bilbo, and Gollum was absolutely hilarious. When reading the book, you hardly know of any of the dwarves, but in the movie, each actor puts so much into their character, that I memorized all of the Dwarfs names.
 But best of all, the movie was awesome; My favorite part was the escape from the goblin mine.
 The movie was emotional, and exciting, and I give it five stars. A lot of fans wonder why Peter Jackson had to make one book into three movies, but you cannot capture the depth that is captured here in anything less.",1410393600,,1669,4.196875

4631452,5,B0059XTU1S,"THE MOVIE

The Hobbit is a strange film series. As of this writing, the first two movies are out and the Battle of the Five Armies is coming in a few short months, though what it will deliver is largely predictable at this point, especially for fans of the book.

The curiosity about The Hobbit is that it strives to be more than its source material suggests. The novel, an episodic adventure tale on a somewhat limited scale, is narrow and much more tightly focused than the film trilogy. My initial reaction upon seeing An Unexpected Journey in theaters was that it was essentially more Lord of the Rings, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was distinctly not the Hobbit as I remembered it.

The broad and sweeping scope of the Hobbit's sequels has been retconned into the original story, along with plotlines stemming from notes found in the Return of the Kings Appendices. A brief mention of another wizard besides Gandalf, Radagast the Brown, gave cause to create a somewhat detailed side story about this character. Additionally, thanks to the benefit of hindsight, events directly connecting to Lord of the Rings plot can now be added into The Hobbits story, such as a meeting in Rivendell where key players for the sequels discuss the potential threat of the dark forces rising in Mordor.

All of that said, the films saving graces are really its performers. Martin Freeman (who will forever be John Watson to me because I first encountered him in the BBC Sherlock series) skillfully delivers the performance of a young Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit who will become the background protagonist from the Lord of the Rings. His quirky performance is excellent, and he is a treat to watch for the duration of the film. Ian McKellan again assumes the role of the wizard/mentor Gandalf the Grey, and he offers another admirable performance. He is noticeably older than he was in Lord of the Rings, which is to be expected given that the sequel trilogy was filmed over a decade ago. However, he never falters in the role as Gandalf.

While there are a number of very enjoyable scenes, the clear and probably unequivocal winner in this film is the depiction of Riddles in the Dark, the famous encounter between Bilbo and Gollum. Andy Serkis motion capture performance as Gollum (whose CGI actually is noticeably improved over the Lord of the Rings trilogy) is a textbook quality performance. In the special features, it is noted that the whole scene was filmed from start to finish repeatedly over a few days and was the first scene shot in the whole movie. As a true testament to Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis skills, this scene is captivating, engaging, and, frankly, perfect. In a movie that is hit or miss throughout, this is the absolute highlight (much like the tense Bilbo-Smaug encounter from the sequel is the highlight for Desolation of Smaug). The performances are theatrically driven, there is really no action to speak of, and it just works so unbelievably well.

VISUALS

This review is specifically of the extended edition of An Unexpected Journey on Blu Ray. This movie was good in theaters. Not great, but good and enjoyable. It was, however, too long despite being the shortest film of the septilogy thus far. Based on that thought, it would be fully expected that an extended edition of an already overlong film is an even worse affront, but the truth is that this version plays out better. The additional scenes and other changes made to the theatrical cut flesh certain story elements out and work better when going into The Desolation of Smaug. Some of them are goofy and jokey, but they tend to work. This is perhaps aided by the fact that it is much easier to watch long movies like this from the comfort of home.

On Blu Ray, the film is vibrant and colorful. It does, however, suffer a bit from its own hyper-realism. There are scenes where the movie looks like a modern HD sitcom ala Big Bang Theory. This creates the problem of allowing the viewer to see the seams holding the fantasy world together.

Another problem with the film is that the CGI is just not very good. It is likely better than the Lord of the Rings trilogys CGI, but the higher framerate and hyper-realism of everything else discussed above renders the CG wargs, for example, quite clearly CG as opposed to practical effects or real in the same way the costumes and certain sets are actually present in the frame. As noted above, Gollums CGI is improved from Lord of the Rings, and much like the scene itself from a presentation perspective, Riddles in the Dark looks wonderful, especially on Blu Ray. The lack of practical effects in this film are a hindrance. They do not render the movie unenjoyable in any sense, but it could be much better with less computer work.

AUDIO

The one component of the film and its corresponding Blu Ray release with which I expect no one to find fault is the sound. Howard Shores score is wonderful in An Unexpected Journey, effortlessly weaving old and new themes together to produce a wonderful aural experience. The surround sound gives every little arrow sound effect character, with masterful use of panning and front and rear speaker management. For those with a surround sound system, this movie does have what I call movie bass, that low, rumbling bass that many action movies have (see, e.g., Man of Steel). I had to turn the bass down a bit because it was overpowering during certain scenes, but that is typical of these types of movies and does not adversely reflect on An Unexpected Journey. In sum, the audio experience is excellent. It is reference-quality, meaning that if someone wants to see what a good audio experience is supposed to be on Blu Ray, pop this film in and let that person enjoy it.

While an additional twenty or so minutes of the movie is great, the real reason to always buy the Extended Editions of these movies is the expansive, high quality collection of extras. This set is just another incredible edition, picking up where Lord of the Rings extras left off. Hours upon hours of extras are packed into this set, and they are very enjoyable to watch. Rarely do I ever go back to extra bonus features for movies, but Lord of the Rings extras (and now, the Hobbits) are my favorites and I watch them regularly. Plenty of documentary-style extras which go in-depth about the characters and the world and many of the stories about how the movie was made are included here, and fans will not be disappointed. There are also full-length commentary tracks, and some information about changes made to the films from the book which details the reasoning behind them. As with the prior Lord of the Rings extended cut features, a clear love of the source material abounds in these extras. Whether you agree with the changes made to the book or not, credit should be given to the team behind these films for at least explaining their decisions along the way.

These extras fall into the category of more of the same if you are coming from the Lord of the Rings films extra features, and that is most certainly a good thing in this case.

PACKAGING

The box looks good next to my Lord of the Rings sets, though I actually wish the style had been retained of just having the logo on the front rather than artwork. This is NOT to say the artwork on the front is badquite the contrary, of the various Hobbit releases, this is my favorite cover art so far. Inside the case, everything is as expected, including a nice printed booklet. Well-done packaging that will look great on your Blu Ray shelf.

SUMMARY / RECOMMENDATION

If you enjoyed the movie in theaters, An Unexpected Journeys extended cut plays out a little better despite its length. It really is a good movie overall. It has too much exposition, too many characters added that were not in the book, and takes a LONG time to get started (approximately 45 minutes is spent with the characters in the Shire before even leaving on their journey). And yet, what it gets right, it really gets right. Added scenes early-on have little callbacks to Lord of the Rings, Riddles in the Dark is cinematic perfection, there are plenty of well-acted and well-written scenes throughout, the music is wonderful, and the cast does an admirable job.

The tragedy (or silver lining, depending on ones perspective) is that somewhere in here is a great movie. After the entire Hobbit trilogy has been released, I expect fans will take it upon themselves to edit the movies into one or two better or tighter movies. What we actually received is a good movie with glimpses of greatness.

The extended cut on blu ray is the definitive version of the film. It has all of the material, a wealth of extras, crisp visuals, and excellent audio. I give this release five stars not because the blu ray is really a perfect release of an imperfect movie. Five stars does not make this a be-all, end-all film. Rather, it is a good movie with a great home video release. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings and want more of the Middle Earth world, this will be right up your alley. This is not as close to the source material as some might prefer, but it generally works, and the few stand-out moments make up for shortcomings elsewhere. Give it a shot, but do so with the extended edition from the comfort of home.",1408665600,,9311,4.652068126520681

In addition, I am so impressed by Tolkien that I read his letters from the 1930's to the 1950's. The filming by Peter Jackson of the Lord of the Rings as one supremely scripted, produced, and edited movie per book yielded a masterpiece (5 stars PLUS). In this movie, at the outset, I liked the casting of Bilbo and Thorin Oakenshield and several others. I had high hopes. However, the make-up of some dwarfs' faces seemed half-done, like comic book art compared to a Rubens--a production failing not seen in the LOTR movies. But, worst of all, trying to make 3 movies out of the single-book Hobbit was over-reach. I won't speculate on the reasons for doing so. Knowing the Hobbit story inside and out, I was surprised to find that I had just bought a blue-ray DVD which contained only one third (33%) of the single book's story. Moreover, the darkness of the 33% story as produced, which seemed garish in its production and over-use of special effects and cartoon characters like the king of the Goblins (a Middle-Earth version of Jabba the Hutt) lacked the warmth and charm of the LOTR movies. The introduction of lookalikes (Galadriel looked like a lifeless hologram, Gandalf a hodgepodge of brunette and gray stand-ins) made the movie seem like it was cobbled together from outtakes of movie scraps. Unlike LOTR, the original Hobbit's subject matter was written for children, and does not scale up well into an adult tale. Unfortunately, in this movie it has been ramped up to be an exotic fantasy version of the modern thriller's nonstop action. So, it gets only 3 stars from me.""from outtakes of movie scraps.

4631565,1,B0059XTU1S,"This movie is disgusting. For one thing the dwarves have NO dignity and all appear ludicrous in dress and behavior, excepting Thorin perhaps, who is a jerk. Jackson wrecked Tolkien's world, portraying the elves, dwarves, and even the hobbits in a ridiculous manner. He also introduced bad and crude humor into this movie, which were not found in Lotr. The Bilbo Baggins is a wreck. He has none of Tolkien's Bilbo's simple courage and wit. For example: compare the Bilbo from Lotr to this Bilbo.....nope. They cannot be the same character. And what's with Radagast and this white Orc? As another reviewer stated, it is ridiculous filler, added to make more money. I have read Lotr and the hobbit, and am now reading the Sillmarillion. There is no connection between Tolkien's works and this movie. An unexpected travesty is right. I sneered all the way through the theater, and walk away when this movie is played anywhere. It failed totally to put a smile on my face.

  Contrast this to the Hobbit novel, the Lotr, and even the Lotr movies(though they have their faults I enjoy them thoroughly. They at least retain much of Tolkien's deep meaning). Frodo, Sam, Bilbo, and all the Hobbits possess a simplicity and purity which is their essence. There is no feeling in the new movie, it is all a joke. A sickening joke. Buy the Hobbit book and leave the rest to your imagination. It is well worth the time. Forget this movie. It is a perversion of Tolkien's wonderful works.",1407196800,9,1473,4.723735408560311

4631582,3,B0059XTU1S,"I don't think it's a secret that this has strayed quite far from the book. The original LOTR movies did too. The question is then whether the movie stands on its own as good.

First: the performances were excellent. Casting did an excellent job and so did the actors cast.

Second: The visuals are stunning -- if a bit too cartoonish. I was in the mood to see something convincingly ancient and, since I don't have the money for a ticket to anywhere with large cyclopic ruins, I watched this. It did it.

I also half-admire how detailed the plot is, explaining things and printing a broader picture than the original book did. The unanswered questions from the end of the book aren't here. This feels like Jackson and friends are trying to make this story more accessible and it seems kind of them. But this has some drawbacks I'll explain later.

Radagast the Brown was both written and portrayed admirably -- and he embodies the point I most want to make about the films and how they fail. But for now, just the good stuff. I both enjoy the character that was created from the hints in Tolkien's books and the expert portrayal by former Doctor Who actor Sylvester McCoy. Casting was pure genius in this choice. In fact, I can't think of a single actor that doesn't fit his/her role perfectly.

But the problem is that this is NOT _The_Hobbit_. It certainly is not what was written by Tolkien.

This is a story inspired by Tolkien, not an actual Tolkien story. Whatever good is here comes from the same source as what is bad -- Jackson et alia's interpretation and creative re-creation of Tolkien's mythology. My issue with this is not that there has been change or that the book is ""always right"" -- these books would always have demanded compromise from a film, even ones as exceedingly long as these. Also, there is nothing wrong with being inspired and creating something based off of something else.  Tolkien himself based his stories on Nordic, Finnish, and Germanic myths and legends.

The problem is that Jackson et alia are trying too hard to make these movies too many opposing things at once. In that process, they completely overshadowed the most subtle and moving things about The Hobbit. When Tolkien wrote his works, it was after years of effort and consideration. A delicate balance was struck. Entire cultures and histories were written so they could be alluded to -- but not actually mentioned -- in the published texts. All of this created an air of tragic beauty and ancient wonder. The refinement in this can come off as stuffy or snobbish at times, but that quickly gives way to a humble wonderment.

The refinement of the author's language is gone, replaced by a jarringly modern informality. This is most obvious in the actual language used in the dialogue. Some quips are of the form that comedic moments in bad modern Disney cartoons take, and it is extremely distressing against the backdrop that Middle Earth is supposed to provide. The luster of the noble and ancient atmosphere Tolkien was trying to make has been replaced by something far too silly and contemporary.

The other, and much more serious, problem is this: Jackson does not get what Tolkien did; less (explained) is more (said). It seems insane to say this of an author who invented entire languages as a basis for four -- JUST FOUR -- books he published in his lifetime. I'd like to point out that he revealed his aeons of invented history and myth in bits and pieces with vague clues and snippets of poems. The reader puts these clues together gradually and begins to appreciate how ancient this mythical world is. That is part of why the books are so moving -- Tolkien understood that the best way to impart an impact like that isn't a glossary or encyclopedia entry, but in the way people generally learn about the world as they're going about heir daily lives -- in bits and pieces and through osmosis while other things are in the foreground.

Peter Jackson chose to make too much too obvious and explains much too much.  We can be entertained by this spectacle, but it can't seem real in a ""spiritual"" sense -- in the way that Tolkien said that all myths are real.

Tolkien was a master of the illusion of consistency and authenticity. The reason we think so is that all of the contradictions and confusion was not in the books he published but rather in the back-story work and preparation work that took him decades to pursue. The contradictions and flaws would come out years later with his posthumous publishing. Where he did not have a concrete answer, he had rumors and myths and mysteries. It felt a bit like real life -- you know there's some mystery lurking behind how things got the way they are, but you can't quite put it together with the faint clues you have. You see a theme or thread tying it together, but you can't quite grasp it completely. Jackson and company are too clear on too many things, and that gets them into trouble. Drawing too much attention to too many explanatory details sets one up for a big fall for too reasons; life never makes things that clear, so it doesn't seem believable and any contradictions or ill-fitting details will become obvious. Reading Tolkien, one feels like it could all be true because the murkiness of the mystical as he portrays it will remind us of things in our own lives. The similarity makes us wonder about dragons in mountains or hidden tiny people in hills. The daydream Tolkien conjured is like a spell that lingers, fading very slowly and never completely.

Watching Jackson's take on Tolkien, on the other hand, is more like watching a surreal cartoon  -- it could never happen and we just don't believe it. It is good escapism and a distraction, but it doesn't have the same soul.

Jackson tried to capture a lot of detail and to give depth by giving the audience everything in overabundance. He missed the point entirely. He gave us too little by giving too much. Paradoxically, the movies would have given us MORE if they were SHORTER.

Please do not misunderstand: I did enjoy this. I am just saying that I can never LOVE it.",1407110400,,6100,4.633333333333334

4631618,2,B0059XTU1S,"I am truly sorry but this movie series sucks.  The Hobbit was an enjoyable book with a much more child-like and innocent tone than the subsequent Lord of the Rings.  I looked forward to the cinematic recreation.  I assumed it would be as skillfully executed and faithfully rendered as the aforementioned epic.  Instead, they took the story and converted it into a comic book movie lacking humor, credibility, and quality.  Worse still they essentially took the barest outlines of the plot and stretched it out ad nauseam with with what appears to be a hastily contrived set of new events and characters.  This might have been okay if they had done a decent job.  They didn't.  There is none of the whimsy of the Hobbit, or the profundity of the Lord of the Rings. Most importantly, there is none of the entertainment value either. I could not manage to sit through any of the entire presentations - I stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons when I was a child, though I must admit that some episodes of Sponge bob make more sense.  The movies are bad, and boring, and they are ever so predictable in their adolescent configuration of good and evil, violence and sentiment.  It could have been a great single move that would have taken its place alongside the truly outstanding Lord of the Rings.  What a waste.  What a sell-out.  What a disappointment.",1406505600,,1355,4.714893617021277

You can tell he read more then the hobbit or the Lord of the rings series I'd be willing to bet he read the sirmerillian as well. This is the prelude to the load of the rings, again with this one they did have to throw in some sex appeal with a little female elf who's hot of course,  and some of the dwarfs are very human looking at hot ad well but that doesn't take away from the story line at all in fact they added some things from other books to spice things up. Just ignore the sex appeal you know they only did that as a societal gimmick (or if you watched lord of the rings for the sensual appeal hey they still have it in this series) but the story line is great  too.",1406160000,,747,3.9078947368421053

4631675,2,B0059XTU1S,"This review is not about the movie itself, but the Blu-ray version. Peter Jackson filmed this at higher frames per second than what's been the custom, which is meant to make the film look more real. It accomplishes this perfectly. What that means, however, is that in the early scene at Bilbo's home, for example, I could easily tell Gandalf was filmed in front of a green screen. The lighting looked different, and you could tell he was not quite making eye contact or reacting to someone right there in the room with him. Normally, that's fine in movies because they film in front of green screen and do optical tricks all the time, and you don't notice it. But here, it's distracting. It's as if you're trying to watch the film, fully immersed in the story, while an obnoxious guy is in your ear telling you how each scene was filmed.

It's a shame because, visually, some parts are amazing. The wide shots of the landscape and mountains look incredible, but the cons outweigh the pros. Too much of the fight scenes, which take up a solid chunk of the film, look fake. It's not as obviously fake as the cartoon scenes in Mary Poppins, but it's close. I recommend not getting the Blu-ray.",1405987200,,1190,4.534883720930233

4631711,3,B0059XTU1S,What a mess. But somewhere in this bloated film is a story that is worth telling. It needs some major editing. The Hobbit book was very linear and very translateable to film.  Why Jackson felt he had to up the action and 'add tension' to the point nothing was tense anymore (just absurd) I will never know. But there are bits that work beautifully. Get the DVD and use the ff button to do your own 'edit'. Freeman and the rest of the cast are perfect. it's a shame the actual story lost much of the heart of the original in the over-telling and 'improvements',1405728000,,559,4.3238095238095235

4631844,3,B0059XTU1S,"Last weekend I saw Peter Jackson's version of The Hobbit.  I was entertained but disappointed.  I am not a Tolkien purist; so I don't object to changing the book in a movie.  Unfortunately, Jackson seems to have either ignored or misunderstood eucatastrophe, the heart of Tolkien's epic vision and his greatest contribution to literature.
 Jackson's problem is that he can't resist portraying Bilbo Baggins as a hero.  A hero is a person or a character who courageously exercises his skills in the cause of good.  Jackson's Bilbo is far more active than Tolkien's.  Instead of suddenly rushing off to the join the dwarves' adventure, Tolkien's Bilbo has decided not to go until he is rushed out of his hobbit hole by Gandalf.  He doesn't help the dwarves in a fight against the trolls, but rather manages to escape while the trolls fight among themselves and with the exception of Thorin is unable even to warn the dwarves, who are neatly bagged without much of a fight.  He most certainly does not rush to Thorin's aid against the orcs and the wolves, but, like Gandalf and the rest of the dwarves, is helplessly and hopelessly up a tree--a tree that Tolkien's Bilbo can not even get into without the help of the dwarf Dori. In Tolkien even Gandalf does not save himself and the rest of the party by sending a message to the eagles.  The eagles see the fires and hear the howling wolves and decide to steal the goblins' prey from them.
 Some of these errors can be attributed to Jackson's mistaken attempts to make the story more exciting and giving into the irresistible urge to use special effects, but the problem is much deeper.  Jackson has the concealed Bilbo see Gollum drop the ring and then take it.  In the novel Bilbo has been accidentally dropped by Dori as they are fleeing from the goblins, then is crawling in the dark when he just happens to touch a ring--the ring--and puts it in his pocket.  He does not guess the riddle concerning time because Gollum makes a mistake but rather unwittingly asks for time and serendipitously saves his life.
 What makes Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy more than a ripping good story is his fictional presentation of eucatastrophe in which heroes fail and evil defeats itself (See ""Harry Potter Part II: The Good and the Not So Good"").  The happy accidents in The Hobbit prepare us for the epic vision of The Lord of the Rings.
 Unlike his version of the Ring trilogy, Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit has his heroes, like Bilbo, too active in bringing about victory.  Eucatastrophe is gone.  The movie is entertaining, but it will not make our hearts swell with an inexplicable joy as our imaginations soar to a hope that is real but beyond humanity's reach.",1403913600,,2721,4.678571428571429

4631847,4,B0059XTU1S,"I like these expanded edition because the idea that all tales must be told in a set period of time can be difficult. This expanded version is not exactly the book though the fleshing out is derived from Tolkien's other works like the Silmarillion. These back stories given screen time is a nice set up for the following Lord of the Rings so all is not terrible. The one drawback is how hard it is to translate such a broad ranging adventure romp without losing the story's heart. So far the balancing act is holding but if they continue to push it this could become a mess mired in it's own good intentions.
The casting is spot on and while I'm not fond of the costuming effects I'll let it slide because the other option was to go all digital or for the characters to look too much like regular humans. Sometimes it gets in the way but most of the time of flows smoothly.
The color pallet is also a richer for this film than the previous LOTR series but I think it denotes a different time and mood and works very well with few reservations. The heart of the film is there but the mission feels less desperate. Again, that's the story so there's not much to do and artificially ranting up dire consequences would only muddy the tale.

I thought it brilliant and brought together a few of the story lines to make more sense. I read the book of course and the movies aren't a true rendition of the books. BUT if you take it as it's own story, than it's as brilliant as a movie ever was.

Most readers make the mistake of believing books are always that much better. But us readers have to keep in mind that half the reasons books are better is because we get to use our own imaginations. We see something as we want to see it, not as the author necessarily saw it and not necessarily as any other reader saw it.

This is a long movie and there are many drawn out moments where it's clear they are just eating up tape.  A little better editing could have kept this moving better.  I think Peter Jackson is getting a little too self-indugent.

4631927,4,B0059XTU1S,"I watched both films and gotta say, despite how awesome they LOOK they aren't accurate representatives of The Hobbit.
Fleshing the story out to make three films is ambitious but in doing so it loses a LOT of the flavor of the book , as I recall its basically a childrens story. To proceed with details may be spoilery so I won't save to say:
 Its interesting to link the story of The Hobbit with the story of  The Lord Of The Rings and it works for what thats worth but The Hobbits story (outside of finding the One Ring) has nothing to do with LOTRs .At least as far as I remember.... Its been decades since I last read The Hobbit  . The violent battle scenes are part of the story but here they seem to be over the top. The Goblin King was kind of funny and seems to have captured the flavor of  the book.
 The films are fun as far as they go but I would recommend reading the books as well so JRRTs whole intent can be appreciated.
At least these versions of The Hobbit and LOTRs are superior than the crap from Ralph Bakshi ( outside of Brother Theodore voicing Gollum) and that fact alone adds a star to my review

4631963,5,B0059XTU1S,"I heard many things about this movie and was doubting its worth watching. I decided one day, when I had a few hours to kill, to just buy it. I LOVED IT.

Immediately gripped my attention and held it throughout the movie.
I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Lord of the Rings.
The acting is superb and the scenery is beautiful!

Note: The characters get unrealistically lucky in many situations. ""Humorously so""",1401062400,,419,4.648648648648648
4631964,5,B0059XTU1S,"I have heard and read the critics. I have read the book, and in fact I am reading it again as I write this. I believe Peter Jackson stayed true, as far as he could, to the book. He couldn't go word for word from the book..he had to create his vision-and I loved it. The Hobbit is my favorite series, yes even out of Lord of the Rings. I love the tale of Bilbo and how he left his comfy hole in the ground for a group of Dwarves. Thorin in this movie is ""art"" Richard Armtage (I hope I spelled his last name correctly) is a gifted actor through the theater world. I think his fan base has exploded since these movies. Well, another great review for a very good movie. 5 stars.",1401062400,,675,4.007407407407407

I have peeked at some of the content and graphics, so it looks exceptional for what I viewed...but I'm waiting for Part 3 to be released before I actually watch the full trilogy.  I am cheating in giving this any rating, as until I actually see the complete series, anything I say or claim is based upon the reputation of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy which I did enjoy.",1400976000,,455,4.218390804597701
4631967,5,B0059XTU1S,"I didn't  like the casting in the LOTR trilogy, the Hobbits were too feminine, and bordered on homosexual. The rest of the cast was excellent, couldn't be any better. So I was worried about the actor portraying Bilbo, I thought he would be awful. Turns out he is perfect!! He is no hero, has little charisma, no ego, not an adventurous guy, everything Bilbo is supposed to be. Thorin, Gandalf, all of the elves were great, you could believe they were real. The only disappointment for me was the CGI characters, like the trolls, the Wargs, Goblin king. Just annoying, excessive, something wrong, not natural, or believable. Like Jarjar Binks in Star Wars, that annoying creature. But I guess its a difficult thing to do. Maybe less is more. CGI creatures still have a ways to go. The movie is always moving, the action rarely stops, the fight scenes are awesome.  I hope the rest of the trilogy is as good as this!",1400889600,,914,4.601226993865031

Its the first of the three part series. This story precludes the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Its really wonderful that they have used the same actors playing thier same corresponding roles that they had in Lord of the Rings. Very unusual for a series that has taken this many years to create. Its a class A touch to a class A production of the timeless J R Toiken classic tale. If you are not familuar with the story watch the Hobbit series before you watch Lord of the Rings.

The first of the trilogy is great, and well worth watching.  I doubt anyone who is prepared to let the Hobbit take you into Middle Earth and simply entertain you, could be disappointed.

Of course, if they had used the eagles from the beginning of their travel, the film would have been 5-minutes long with no weird little worlds to explore.

This first film is based on about 100 pages of Tolkien, and if you add up all the dialogue in the ridiculous extended edition, it's probably more words than Tolkien put in the first third! These people are just desperate for Middle Earth, that's all there is to it, and Jackson is more than happy to keep shoveling material at people are who begging him to take their money. I have a different approach to the whole thing, having read the book, and listened to the audio as well: READ THE BOOK INSTEAD. Then watch the movie. Yay. It's a movie. It's not Prometheus giving fire to mankind from the gods. The shameful thing is, if you ask a random person who created ""The Hobbit"", they'll probably tell you it was Peter Jackson.

I own the complete Trilogy of the LORD OF THE RINGS, and I have both of the now released movies in the Hobbit series.  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is much like the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, in that for me at least, they are the best two movies of both series.  Having said that, I still enjoy the other additions to both works.  It is just that the two opening films have a degree of freshness and a well structured story that is easy to follow.  The second films, for me, in both series, do not quite have the freshness of the opening volumes, and the stories I find, in especially the middle film segments, get almost repetitious.  But, they are still quite entertaining and the last film segments get everything heading for the very exciting conclusions they both have at their ends.  It is quite a ride; and, what advancements they have created in the CGI work.

Someone in Hollywood decided that they need to improve the work of a master by adding in some Hollywood recipes. Like taking an Ansel Adams and improving it with a little watercolor.

4632185,1,B0059XTU1S,"My title says it all.
Tolkien's books and whole world was philosophical and very specific about certain things.

Mercy is a virtue (elves would never behead a captive orc, as they do in this film). They ""Americanized"" elves in this film, and like all our other major media, it teaches that killing ""bad"" people is actually good. Tolkien knew better, and would never have approved of this disgusting corruption.

The animosity between the Dwarves and Elves in this film bears no relationship to the real history of that distrust in Tolkien's mythology (has much more to do with the sacking of Menegroth, taking of the Nauglamir+Silmaril, and killing of King Thingol by the Dwarves 5,000 years ago and nothing to do with the coming of Smaug. BTW, if you don't know, the Ents killed every single dwarf involved in that shameful deed and none ever returned home. Also, Berin recovered the Nauglamir/Silmaril, which eventually went to Ereandil, and is now a star in the sky (Elbereth, who's light is contained in Frodo's ""phial of Galadriel.""

In fact, the way in which Hollywood has corrupted Tolkien's message (which is sorely needed today), is similar to how Morgoth or Sauron's one ring corrupt everything in Tolkien's works. Tolkien was prophetic, like Orwell, Huxeley, and others. What he suspected has in fact come to pass.

Tolkien believed in the power of the humble and unassuming. This movie is all about the mighty heroes and how great they are.

Basically, this movie (and the previous LOTR trilogy) undermines everything Tolkien was trying to teach (all great wisdom, by the way). Tolkien fought in the Somme battle in WWI. He was not a sycophant for how great military power is. To the contrary, he taught that power corrupts, and the desire for power, wealth, beauty, whatever, leads to evil.

Might as well call this movie ""Hobbit Rambo."" Great example of the shallowness and banality of Hollywood.

This movie cheapens and distorts the magnificent vision and wisdom of the late Professor Tolkien. That distortion is unfortunately as American as apple pie, and contributes to our collective mental illness.

In other words, read the book if you think you like Tolkien. If you liked the LOTR films rather than the books, then you are not a Tolkien fan, but a Peter Jackson fan. The two visions have nothing in common except Jackson ripped off all of Tolkien's ideas for his Rambo film.",1398902400,5,2396,4.898765432098766

4632206,5,B0059XTU1S,"A 4.5 Star Rating.  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Extended Edition)(Blue-ray + UltraViolet)

This is a review of this product and not the movie.  However, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Unlike the vast majority, I read the book after watching the movie several times on HBO in HD format.  Although, I appreciate and enjoyed each medium for the manner in which the story is presented  but I liked the movie better because I prefer action and, thus, I find most children books a wee bit boring.  J.R.R Tolkein was a genius and 99% of the time here Peter Jackson has indeed honored and reimagined his work incredibly well.

This movie in blue-ray is beyond amazing and the sound is spectacular and New Zealand is the one and only ""Middle-Earth."".  I am totally hooked on this format. The picture is so clear and vivid that I felt like I could reach out and touch the actors or the scenery.  Some readers may say well duh!  However, in my defense, early on and sometime still the blue-ray version are not so amazingly better than the DVD version.  I will download the Ultraviolet version eventually but quite frankly if it would lower the price of blue-rays movies I could gladly do without it.  I chose to wait for the extended addition before purchasing this movie and I feel it was the most prudent choice.  The extended edition is available in DVD but for 2.79 difference I recommend buying the blue-ray version unless, of course, one doesn't have a blue-ray player.

The reason I only give this purchase a 4.5 star rating is because I found the majority of the added scenes to be a bit disappointing.  Unlike the scenes in the LOTR's extended edition, the scenes here, IMO, didn't really reveal any additional information from the book, ""have any real story value"" ( to use PJ's words during the commentary) and/or add any real depth to the story/movie.  Nevertheless, as a consummate fan I was happy just to have more of the movie than is in the theatrical version.

I highly recommend this product even to those who aren't ""die-hard"" fans of the movie.  It's just a richer experience of this movie.

Since other reviewers have already done an excellent job of describing and detailing exactly what this product contains, I won't attempt to present this info in my review.",1398643200,,2297,4.6807980049875315

I've watched this all the way through at least a dozen times before posting my review. It suffers from what I've decided is ""Lucasosis"", or, what happened to the last three Star Wars films. It just has no soul. It's too big, too much - in every way. The hyper-real video game action is just boring. The characters are silly.

After just the first film (now I've seen 2 of 3) he made me a believer.  Not only does it maintain interest throughout, but it feels less a children's story than Tolkien's book, and more interesting for adults.  There are 2 whole discs of special features in addition to the added scenes.  While they may not quite match the scale of some of the bonus features to Lord of the Rings (for example, they don't explain all over again why Tolkien's works have enduring interest; how he developed his world etc) there's plenty of interesting detail about how various scenes were shot, what felt particularly challenging to various actors, and many other details you just don't get when you only see the film in the theatre.

4632228,3,B0059XTU1S,"All three of the LOTR film are timeless classics and some of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. All three films were extremely powerful, immensely emotional, unbelievably gut wrenching and epic beyond words.
So now, Nine years later, a prequel trilogy is being made with Peter Jackson back in the director's chair. That alone had me sold. What could possibly go wrong? Actually, I think a more fitting question to ask is ""What the hell went wrong?""
There is a rather rough transition from ""The Return of The King"" to ""An Unexpected Journey"" as far as tone goes. King was an all-out war movie. The film was literally three and a half hours of huge battles. ""Journey"", however, is an all-out kid's movie, which brings me to my first point.
One of the two problems I had with the film was just how juvenile it was. I guess that could be my fault for going to see movie based on kid's book. But, as a prequel to the LOTR films, I thought it would be a little more, well, mature. The film has everything from burping contests to snot jokes to even a sing along musical number. (That seen had me crouching down in my seat, embarrassed that I was seeing this film on my own time.)
The second problem I had was the pacing. The first hour of the film is so slow. Way too much exposition! It's like a half hour of old Bilbo giving backstory to 45 minutes of the Dwarfs singing and going over plans at Bilbo's house. Even when the new adventure begging, thing barley pick up, as they keep on stopping to give us more exposition.
Ok, I'm done with the bad stuff. On the other hand: the last hour of the film was consistently entertaining. In fact, Peter Jackson threw in a few scenes that brought back warm memories of the last 3 films. 1st: He adds moments that let us have a glimpse of the enormous heart that made the other films so unforgettable. Gandalf's speech about heroes to Cate Blanchet and Bilbo's speech to Dwarfs about Home at the end of the film were both touching.
There were two other scenes that genuinely moved me. The first was the scene where Bilbo is invisible because of the Ring and he holds his sword up to Gollums neck. He is about to swing, but Gollum then turns around and can see that he is destroyed and heartbroken over the loss of the ring, his big blue eyes holding in tears. Bilbo lowers the sword.
The second the last scene when Thorin finally accepts Bilbo. He starts yelling at Bilbo about how he knew from the beginning that Bilbo would be nothing but a useless burden and would do nothing but get in the way. He then finishes by breaking down and saying that he's never been more wrong in his life. When he hugged Bilbo, my heart honestly skipped a beat.
The emotional moments were only half of what made the other trilogy so great. The other half is being so genuinely epic. There is a scene at the end when Thorin lays eyes on the Orc leader who..., wronged him in some way years earlier. Thorin lifts up his sword and in slow motion, runs at the Orc across the burning tree with the song playing from LOTR when the hooded riders are chasing Frodo on their black horses.
Also, Christopher Lee's cameo was a very present surprise.(surprise to me at least. I guess I didn't read the cast list beforehand. Up until the credits rolled I thought Legolas was going to be in it. I kept on waiting for him to show up, even in the final scene.)
It's the warm memories from LOTR that would make me recommend the film to any (patient) moviegoers.",1398297600,,3478,4.36055469953775

4632230,4,B0059XTU1S,"There was an unreal amount of hype for this film, following the enormously successful Lord of the Rings Trilogy, which collectively earned nearly 3 billion at the box office as well as 30 Oscar nominations (winning 17). A tough act to live up to, which explains why a lot of people were disappointed with An Unexpected Journey. While some of it is due to a few missteps by Jackson and company, some of it is beyond their control entirely. As has been stated many times, The Hobbit (or There And Back Again) is a breezy and whimsical fairy tale of only about 300 pages. Aimed primarily at children, the tone is much lighter and its conflict isn't quite as large scale or apocalyptic as The Lord of the Rings. In fact, The latter was written nearly twenty years after The Hobbit, aimed at the same audience who had grown up into adults, hence its more complex themes and narrative. Considering this, some of the disappointment people are harboring have to do more with the source material, not with Jackson's film making choices. However, there are missteps on Jackson's part, an overuse of cgi being chief among them. Orcs and goblins are now mostly computer effects, where as in LOTR they were real people with makeup effects and costumes. There is an authenticity with the makeup effects that is lost with cgi, making the orcs look less fearsome. It also means that The Hobbit trilogy will age much faster then the LOTR has, as cgi is improved constantly, outdating previous work every year. Another issue I had was how cartoonish some of the action is (most irksome for me is when Kili blocks incoming arrows with a ladder, then deflects them with his sword), but given the lighter nature and tone of the story, its possible to forgive. The biggest issue I have with the film is how the narrative focus rests on Thorin and the dwarves, rather then Bilbo (an issue that is magnified to an even greater extent in the second film).

However, gripes aside, it is easy to see how Peter Jackson has grown as a director over the years; An Unexpected Journey is every bit as atmospheric as LOTR. The production design, cinematography, costuming, music and acting are every bit as good here as they were in LOTR, even if the story of The Hobbit lacks the dramatic chops of the former. Ian McKellen is in top form as Gandalf, Richard Armitage is fierce and proud, perfect as Thorin, and Martin Freeman, as Bilbo, is one of the very best casting decisions Jackson has made throughout his entire Middle Earth franchise. Freeman is perfect as the bumbling, unsure, and confused hobbit, making him both amusing and relatable in a way the hobbits haven't been before.

An Unexpected Journey has been relentlessly criticized for its pacing and running time. The film is ridiculously close to the book, with a few changes made in order to include some of Tolkien's work in the appendices concerning the Necromancer and Dol Goldur. Seeing how The Hobbit is one continuous story told in a single novel, it goes without saying that pacing issues do arise by turning the story into a trilogy. Doing so provides one with a lot more time to spend in Middle Earth, but prevents The Hobbit from being the tightly edited masterpiece that the Lord of the Rings was. An Unexpected Journey therefore serves as a three hour introduction. When the movie finishes, there is a lack of true satisfaction, as if The Fellowship of the Ring had ended when Frodo and company arrived at Rivendell. The movie ends right when the story is beginning to heat up and get interesting. However, I personally like the slower pacing of An Unexpected Journey and the way it allows you to stop  and take in the sights of Middle Earth. It may not be fast paced, but it builds atmosphere and a sense of wonder beautifully, at least as well as the Lord of the Rings did, if not better. And there are some brilliantly executed scenes, chief among them being The Unexpected Party and Riddles in the Dark, where Andy Serkis makes a welcome and very exciting return as Gollum. In conclusion, An Unexpected Journey is not for everyone; one has to let go of what the film could have been if it had been a little more streamlined. If you are willing to accept it on its own terms, then it is a grand, majestic ride full of adventure and excitement.

As for the extended edition, while its hard to recommend it over the theatrical cut (which played like an extended cut in and of itself), there are some amusing additions, chief among them a great little scene between Elrond and Bilbo at Rivendell, which I believe should have stayed in the theatrical cut. Other additions include a song by the Goblin King (dreadful), skinny dipping dwarves (hilarious, but a bit too silly), Bilbo and Thorin overhearing a conversation between Gandalf and Elrond (should have stayed in), and a scene in Hobbiton's marketplace, which is really a glorified throwback to Lord of the Rings. Except for the scene with Bilbo and Elrond, I would recommend the relatively leaner theatrical cut as far as the movie goes. However, the extras on the extended edition are themselves worth the cost, providing hours upon hours of insight into the making of the film. These are substantial extras that are the equal of what we got with the Lord of the Rings extended editions. Highly recommended if you are a fan of Jackson's Middle Earth.",1398297600,,5351,4.671261930010605

4632297,5,B0059XTU1S,"Whether in LOTR or in the Hobbit, extended versions from Peter Jackson mean better quality. They can be long movies when the cuts are opened, but the rich textures emerge so much better. In LOTR, the extended version showed Galladril giving Sam a rope, which appears again in the second movie when Sam puts the rope on Gollum's neck and he screams that it burns. The giving of the gift is omitted in the theatrical version of the first movie, making the ""burning"" make no sense.

In the Hobbit the added footage is not so dramatic in Unexpected Journey, but it still makes a difference.

4632299,2,B0059XTU1S,"I wrote a review for the Hobbit 2: Where's Bilbo and forced myself to look at the reasoning behind why I hated it so much. This movie has its flaws though admittedly it is a vastly superior film to the second (though that isn't saying much).
I want to start out by talking about what I actually did like about this film and then I'll offer up a shorter list of the problems with this film, especially within the extended edition.

Though my previous review began with an extended summary of the movie I find I lack the energy required to do so for this movie and in many ways I lack the memory of what actually happened in this film.

Many will say that this movie was too boring and that the second movie is vastly superior, do not listen to these people, they crave nothing but fast action and pretty things to look at. This movie is superior to the second for the simple reason that it was intended to end where it did and it didn't decide to flesh out certain aspects in order to add an unnecessary third film.

What I liked about this film
1) Gollum's cave: this was without a doubt the best part of the movie, Gollum was perfectly executed, the scene was tense and it didn't drag out, like the Smaug scene in part 2. Additionally Gollum once again remains the best bit of CGI in this series, even better than Smaug to be perfectly honest, with the performance behind him you can actually believe he's real for a few moments.
2) The Misty Mountains song: this was almost perfectly executed and it really set up the culture of the dwarves and the fact that, though they may seem silly, they are the diaspora of the dwarves and are without a home.
3) Christopher Lee's performance; this was one of the top things for me just because of how obvious it was that the poor man was in extreme pain, his straight back just showed and arthritic performance that sadly has to be the final film of an incredible career.
4) Galadriel; somehow this film did not ruin Galadriel, Cate is actually more stunning here than in the first film and it is spectacular.

Now for the more fun part, what I hated or disliked about this film
1) The opening, I found this too similar to the opening in LoTR, though it gets a bit sillier in some respects, I was able to actually buy most of what was happening, and then a dwarf picks up a molten piece of metal with his bare hand and smashes it between two comically large hammers. This is problematic because it's silly and detracts from any realism that may have been built up in the opening.
2)  The revealing of the Silmaril in the extended opening. This hurt me, this is something that should not be around, the silmarils are lost and that the dwarves somehow have one goes against so much of Tolkein's lore.
3) Frodo's presence: I get it, we want to connect the two films but that this film is apparently just Bilbo writing of it is silly. I fully expect a scene in the third film where Frodo walks up, looks over Bilbo's shoulder and says ""Oh Bilbo, that's not how it happened.""
4) Azog the orc: listen to me. This orc should be dead, he died at Moria, it's his son that is following the party. I actually think that that would have made for a better story, maybe we see a different side of orc culture and we see an orc out for revenge for the death of his father, maybe make us actually relate to him for a second? A relatable villain, isn't that what we always want these days?
5) Radagast the Narnian, suddenly this movie took a strange turn in which we're treated to goofy hedgehogs being protected by the Doctor (who is apparently high on Mushrooms) This was such a stupid interpretation of Radagast and it is an insult to everything the first films did as well as what Tolkien did. They wanted a character that appealed to the kiddies but if you have to do that by making him high I'm not sure if that actually is a good call.
6) Gandalf's fear/irritation of Saruman: look at Fellowship. Look at Gandalf's and Saruman's relationship there, they are friends. Gandalf goes to Saruman and is clearly close with him, yet here we see Gandalf scared or annoyed of him. This is backsliding of characters and actually damages their relationship that was set up a decade ago.
7) The line ""the legends are true! Giants! Stone Giants!"" This was so poorly delivered that it actually made the scene just seem like it was set up to show some rock 'em sock 'em robot fights. This scene would have been just as well executed if they never made mention of what they were but instead just had the battle and had the dwarves trying to survive.
8) The Goblin King as presented in the extended edition: this character wasn't bad in the theatrical film, a little annoying and a little cartoony but still kind of fun and reminiscent of the book. In the extended edition though we are treated to a song (which I don't hate) which is ended by a fist pump (which is the worst). We are then treated to a ""made in Rivendale"" gag that is simply stupid and pulls you out of the film. These films should never make references to modern things and yet here we have a moment when the Goblin King essentially looks at the camera and winks, it detracts from the film and instead reminds you that you are in fact watching a film made ""for children""
9) Goblins/orcs: this is a nerdy one. Goblins and orcs are the same thing. Tolkien described the use of goblins as being a Hobbit language thing. Orcs is what men call them, there shouldn't be a difference between the two, especially in how they refer to themselves. I don't care if they look different but the language/names should be the same.
10) The CGI chase scene through Goblin Town: This scene was stupid, we're treated to CGI characters running from CGI monsters that looks like a deleted scene from a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. This is followed by Gandalf facing down the Goblin King on a narrow bridge (like the Balrog, get it?) The bride breaks and they fall, this is stupid and shows the utter disregard for physics or survivability. The dwarves though land at the bottom safely, even after the Goblin King lands atop them.
11) The overuse of CGI: This is the same issue I had with the second film. Jackson has lost himself, there was a time he would have done as much as possible with real effects, here though he seems to want to do as much with CGI as possible, even when the CGI looks awful. The wargs, the orcs, the goblins, the eagles, they all look terrible and only serve to pull any sense of realism from the film. Why is it that a film that came out a decade after LoTR and with a budget three times that of LoTR has CGI that looks worse than LoTR? I've seen what WETA can do. I've seen King Kong, I've seen District 9. For some reason this film's CGI looks awful, where did the money go? Did they have to rush the film? There's one interview that sticks in my mind on the extended edition. Jackson has a set of costumes made for the goblins that take the dwarves, however he soon decides he doesn't like them and instead converts them to CGI. I don't understand this mindset. Look at LoTR, despite the fact that almost all the orcs are costumes they look amazing. Jackson seems to have come to the conclusion that he can simply do it in CGI and call it good.

Ultimately this is the first sign of what is wrong with the second film. Jackson is turning into George Lucas and is making the same mistakes he made with the prequel films (only with someone else's material, which is worse). I'm saddened by this, Jackson had so much potential but because of his sudden obsession with CGI and with getting these films done quickly has made it so what made the first films so good has been lost. Here we see a movie that is made for money alone. There is no real heart or passion in this film, it's apparent that few members of the cast have read the original material and it is apparent that Jackson has somehow been surrounded by yes men who won't question his decisions, even when they are terrible. I don't wand this to be the case but ultimately it is.

This film is better than the second but that doesn't mean it's good. I am waiting for the end of this year just so we can see the end of this trilogy and we can let it fade into memory.",1397692800,2,8220,4.344176968119713

4632445,3,B0059XTU1S,"Okay, just to clarify, the score is primarily based on the Extended Edition scenes. I do not view the actual movie this way. In fact, I really like the movie. In order to avoid confusion, I will review the movie in two parts: the original, and the extended.

THE ORIGINAL

As previously stated, I really like the theatrical version of the movie. It very much reminded me of the LOTR movies, aside from its goofier tone. I thought that the story was good, the acting was great, the action scenes and special effects were really good, and Martin Freeman is the perfect Bilbo Baggins. As a person who has actually read the book, I must say that between the two Hobbit movies currently released, this is far superior in terms of accuracy. Not very much was added, but rather reimagined as opposed to the second movie which features things such as a terrible dwarf romance and ridiculously complex action scenes.

In terms of complaints, I only have a couple. The first is that there seems to be an overkill on special effects, particularly with the orcs. In the LOTR films, the orcs were actual people with a lot of make up on to look scary. This film, they are pretty much all CGI. The second, is that this film has some cheesy moments. Particularly its ending, which is a little too happy compared to the scene in the book.

Theatrical Final Score: 8.7/10

THE EXTENDED

The Extended Edition is where the real problems arise. Unlike the LOTR Extended Editions, the new scenes do nothing to advance the film. Instead, they make the film seem to long and sometimes more cheesy. Particularly, the scene where the dwarfs are naked in the Rivendell fountain, which changed the film's rating, is really unnecessary and stupid. Also, the Goblin King's song is terribly written, unlike some of the other songs in the movie. Though the nine hours of bonus features might be worth it, the overall additions to the picture are pointless.

4632547,3,B0059XTU1S,"I finally watched the first Hobbit movie last night - or most of it, anyway. I went into it with this reasoning: I had heard all the complaints, so I knew full well it wasn't faithful to the book. I decided to be okay with that because, after all is said and done, it's another trip to Middle Earth. I know and love the first movie trilogy so well that I have conversations with Hobbits in my sleep. Tolkien may have imagined Middle Earth, but Peter Jackson brought it to life. I'd follow that man off a cliff if it meant we'd land in Middle Earth. So when I say I was prepared to love it (despite the flaws), I really do mean it.

That said, I now understand why so many people kicked up a fuss. This wasn't another trip to Middle Earth. This was an homage to Peter Jackson's ego. It's pretty clear to me that Peter Jackson didn't want to make The Hobbit into a movie. What he REALLY wanted was to re-live his Lord of the Rings glory days. The plot is all over the place with laying the groundwork for the story that he clearly loves (the ""one"" ring). It's not bad if you think of it as a long - VERY long - drawn out prequel, but poor Bilbo's story is lost along the way.

It is VERY obvious that he wanted a trilogy, but didn't have nearly enough material to justify three movies. So he stretched things to fill the time, but unfortunately he stretched it the breaking point. Scenes that should last two minutes get stretched to twenty. They're entertaining, but not engrossing. You definitely feel all twenty minutes. It's like he is trying for a grand, sweeping, epic story like the Lord of the Rings, so he swells the music and lingers with the camera - but the story just isn't epic. Lord of the Rings was epic AS WRITTEN, and he just had to follow along with what Tolkein wrote. The Hobbit was not epic, and it's like Peter Jackson was trying to cobble together a masterpiece from bits and pieces of Tolkien taken from who knows where. It just didn't add up, and it certainly doesn't add up to a grand trilogy. It feels long, drawn out, and a little tedious.

I think my biggest complaint is the CGI - that's what killed it for me. The CGI is also extremely annoying. Somehow the Lord of the Rings movies never felt fake. The CGI blended seamlessly with the costumes, scenery, and actors. I could easily believe all the CGI and didn't even notice it. I just got lost in the magic of Middle Earth. This time around Jackson went seriously overboard with it and it is really distracting. I honestly kept thinking Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars.

As a whole, the Lord of the Rings movies felt like a masterpiece. Maybe the next Hobbit movies will prop this one up and Peter Jackson will have done it again.

I love character development and wanted to absorb all the groundwork laid here.  Loved Martin Freeman's Bilbo, he seems the most adventurous hobbit I've ever ""met""! Much more game than any of the LOTR hobbits, I guess if you have read the books (I haven't) you have insight into whether that's as it should be.  Also loved Richard Armitage's Thorin, perhaps unfairly I was a little skeptical based on all the memes but he completely sold me on the ""brooding warrior king"" and more.

I had to take a star off for the bonus features.... on Amazon instant there is nothing but Peter Jackson's video blog that he did during the filming process. While that's certainly not chopped liver, I was kind of hoping for more.  And the tone is still ""very hush-hush, you haven't seen the movie, wait and see""  - even though at this point I HAVE seen it.  So I'm assuming there's more good stuff in the extended edition DVD and will eventually purchase that.

4632598,3,B0059XTU1S,"The film is good. It's just not great.

I saw all three LOTR film in the theatre. I have not seen either Hobbit movies in theatre. I'm pointing that out first to suggest the opinion that ""it's always better at the theatre.""

I read some reviews and heard what family and friends thought of it. Most were pretty negative. I didn't want to know any ""spoilers"" but c'mon I've been reading The Hobbit over and over for over 30 years now. What spoilers could there be?

I wanted the Extended Version DVD set...just to stay of par with my LOTR collection, so I waited to watch it for the first time. YES! I was disappointed!

Here's why: First up, Jackson DID take many liberties with the story. Sure, you might need some action scenes here and there. But a really goofy Radagast? With lightning fast rabbits? That really took me away from any Tolkien I've read.

The casting is nowhere near as good as LOTR trilogy. Something was lost there. Yes, all these dwarves - deal with it! But Thorin is simply too young! Side note - mental imagery from novel to film is very important. Stephan King's ""Christine""  did this well. Not a good movie or book really, but when doofus first saw the beat up old car in the yard - the mental imagery was there. I don't get that with Thorin AT ALL!!! What happened to the different colored hats the dwarves wore? GONE!

Freeman seemed a little too aloof and not really remarkable in his role. It just seemed awkward. Direction was off? His character as Bilbo didn't capture me. All of the dwarves - they aren't bad. But this is far different than what I've imagined from reading the novel so many times.

Even McKellen seemed a bit ""off"". Blanchett, Weaving, and Christopher Lee did fine.

There was just an odd feeling about it all. Trying too hard?

Peter Jackson dragged this into another trilogy. They should have done a two-parter. It's not that complicated of a story. As much as Jackson/Walsh/Bowens tried to keep LOTR faithful to the story....they have failed here from what I've seen.",1395100800,,2020,4.55524861878453
4632599,5,B0059XTU1S,"If you're looking for a word for word adaptation from Tolkien's original story, this isn't it. That being said, it is so well done, and fits so well into the atmosphere that Tolkien created in his fictional universe. This movie combines the Hobbit with other of Tolkien's works such as the Silmarillion to turn this into a marvelous and rich adventure. It has all the sweet charm of Tolkien's book, plus the added depth of his later work to keep the hardcore Tolkien nerds interested.",1395014400,,484,4.705882352941177
4632600,3,B0059XTU1S,"I've read ""The Hobbit"" and LOTR 37 times-throw in ""The Silmarillion"" for another 12 and ""The Complete History of Middle Earth"" and other books numerous times, and this is the most egregious adaption of a work of his-yet. Professor Tolkein did sell the rights to those books for 7.5% in the '60's. To this day the family has not received any money from LOTR and has filed suit against the production of, ""The Hobbit."" For the record when questioned about the trilogy ""Lord of The Rings,"" Christopher's reply was,``My own position is that `The Lord Of The Rings' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form.""
""The Hobbit"" started out very well, with the unexpected party, and Gandalf volunteering Bilbo as the burglar [so as not to have ""13"" members in the group.]  The next day Gandalf shows up to remind Bilbo about his acceptance of the job then disappears[book]. Radagast The Brown was first mentioned in ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" [book] when Gandalf tells Saruman  he meet him and was told ""The Nine have left Minas Morgul."" And the Necromancer, and The Sorcerer of Dolguldur were both disguises of Sauron, before he was ready to start gathering power and rebuilding. (Sauron assumed form not that long relatively, after having the One Ring cut from his hand) This group of Orcs is an outright abomination-never existed. And if the great battle between the Dwarves and Orcs happened in the movie at Moria controlled by the Orcs.? Yet in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" they enter Moria expecting to be welcomed by-Dwarves? The time line is too short. After the first defeat of Sauron the Dwarves ruled Moria. But Thorin is fighting Azog there at a time when Dwarves should be ruling. After the Battle of the Five Armies Durin goes to Moria to restore it and hopefully find the Dwarven Ring of Power and his company awakens the Balrog, a Maiar or minor angel (of fire) as is Gandalf. This mess Jackson creates.
Meeting the trolls Bert, Tom and William, Bilbo wants to show off to the Dwarves and tries picking William's pocket but he has a magic wallet that speaks up and he gets caught. As they are roasting meat, they don't eat him right away. Arguring what to do with him the Dwarves wander out and every one is caught and put in a sack, but Bilbo escapes. They argue and a mysterious voice eggs them on, finally saying,  ""Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!"" Except.....that's the BOOK and not the movie.
There is no attack and chase or appearance by Radagast-they spent the night under the stars with the bread, cheese, and beer from the trolls along with looking at the swords. Next they show up at Rivendell not too comfortable because the two races don't get along well and Elrond tells them the swords are Elvish, made for the Goblin wars and when Thorin shows Elrond his map its under moonlight and  exposes moon-letters, special secret runes that say, ""Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole."" Durin is Thorin's first ancestor, and his Day is the first day of the dwarves' new year. But there's a problem: no one can calculate exactly when Durin's Day falls anymore. Elrond gives Thorin his map back. The next morning, Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves all set off for the Misty Mountains. Kind of tame by contrast with the movie.
Jackson does a much better job with the rock giants, capture by the goblins and Goblin Town, its quite entertaining. Of course Bilbo finds the Ring [ something the Ring has not counted on] and his famous riddle game with Gollum was all played very straight.
After they escape and run down by wargs and climb trees, Gandal grabs pine cones, uses magic to set them on fire and throws them among them wargs, many of which catch fire, run and set others on fire. The goblins arrive, look the situation over and start laughing and singing, ""15 birds in 5 fir trees"" all the while piling firey cones at the bases of the trees. And Gandalf and company are rescued by the Eagles, no Orcs or big battle.
Do YOURSELF a favor and read the book, and see how the True Lord of Middle Earth wrote it.
Its worth the effort.

*As an aside Jackson is supposed to make another ""Lord of The Rings"" related movie, but I cannot figure out what it will be. Professor Tolkein did not sell the rights to the ""Silmarillion."" It took his son Christopher 20 years to put it together, well after his father's death, and its really a loose overview and HE owns the rights to the book. And as his father told him, ""I hold the Silmarills close to my heart."" I suspect Christopher does too.  After the carnage caused by Jackson, especially on the current work, its a mystery indeed what that book might be, except the Akallabth and I think Christopher owns it too.",1395014400,,4793,4.580419580419581

4632658,5,B0059XTU1S,"Having read Tolkien extensively, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVED what Jackson decided to do with the retelling of The Hobbit. To be completely honest, I was quite skeptical when I discovered that a book the size of Tolkien's Hobbit was to be drawn out into 3 films (each at least 2.5 hours in length). However, I stand corrected. Jackson has enriched the original story with expansions into:
1) the Dwarf company itself. That's right, even the great Tolkien simply glossed-over the majority of the company to focus on a select few. Jackson has thankfully chosen to make each one recognizable, distinctive and multi-dimensional.
2) the quiet resurrection of Sauron's power and armies, which while dealt with extensively in Tolkien's various other writings, was not a focus of his original Hobbit installment.
3) Gandalf's absences are finally, fully explained. As well, they add such a fullness to the story overall.
4) characters mentioned in passing -- such as Azog the Defiler and Radagast the Brown -- are given a forum for their fascinating talents. This too lends a further strength to the story's already epic feel.

To sum it up, Jackson has done a justice to Tolkien's works that I never fathomed a filmmaker ever could. I never imagined a director other than Cecil B. DeMille or Sir David Lean could possibly have the ability to lend such exquisite talents to a well-deserved retelling of Tolkien's epics. With the Hobbit, Jackson has truly created an extension of a masterpiece.",1394582400,,1496,4.960159362549801

4632758,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a projected three-film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's ""the Hobbit"", the first fantasy book written by Tolkien taking place in the mythical ""Middle Earth"". Many decades before the recent film, ""the Hobbit"", originally published by Allen and Unwin UK in 1937, ushered in the beginning of the quest fantasy genre of modern fantasy which has been copied many times since. And yet, Tolkien's original novel about a hobbit, a smallish humanoid living on the edges of a mythical world called ""Middle Earth"", who by chance becomes the pivotal character of a quest among dwarfs, holds up surprisingly well even after 75 years.

Peter Jackson has once again provided a mesmerizing screen adaption of one of Tolkien's most beloved tales. The look and feel of Middle Earth is equal to and possibly even better than Jackson's adaption of ""Lord of the Rings"" ten years earlier. But even aside from the look and feel, the acting of the characters stands up well. Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, is the reluctant adventurer, a hobbit who would rather be smoking his pipe and perusing his books than outwitting trolls and goblins. Hobbits enjoy reading about adventure instead of actually engaging in adventure. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, the wise but eccentric wizard whose presence is the very face of Middle Earth. Richard Armitage plays Thorin, the displaced heir of the King Under the Mountain whose dwarven society was shattered by the dragon Smaug. The other dwarfs which make up the band of misfits all have their lovable eccentricities as Tolkien had forged them.

While the story itself of a band of dwarfs seeking to reclaim their home and treasure which was plundered from them by the ominous dragon Smaug is quite well-known, some of the inspiration behind the story may be less well-known to most readers and movie-goers. Tolkien himself was raised in small medieval-like towns in the county of Worcestershire. These humble towns in the English countryside ring strikingly of Tolkien's Hobbiton. Both Bilbo Baggins and later Frodo Baggins will leave Hobbiton and become enmeshed in great epic quests and battles, somewhat similar to when Tolkein became a young man and entered into the epic conflict of World War I. These same themes on a grander scale will play out in ""the Lord of the Rings"". Also, Tolkien was a scholar of medieval and Nordic mythology, and these stories were intended as a kind replacement for the lost English mythology and lore resulting from the Norman conquest of 1066.

I think the main issue for movie-goers is whether or not one wants to revisit Middle Earth and hang out there for nearly three hours. If you do, then there are almost no shortcomings at all to ""the Hobbit"". A few sequences went on a bit long, particularly when the dwarfs are taken hostage by Goblins, and other long-winded sequences in which the CGI effects are used ad infinitum. At the same time, the film is true to Tolkien's original vision. Jackson's intent I believe is to immerse the viewer into Middle Earth as if the audience is part of the quest along with Bilbo and the Dwarfs. Also, the scenes with the most ghoulish character Gollum, do not drag on too long. In all an absolute triumphant of high fantasy filmmaking. But if you're taste is not in the realm of fantasy of this type, it may be too much. All I can do is offer my condolences.",1394064000,,3412,4.839041095890411

However, the movie is a must own for any Tolkein and/or Peter Jackson fan.  It's just too bad that they felt the need to churn out another trilogy when this movie could have been made in a single episode, I'm sure.  Extras are forgettable.",1393459200,,393,4.416666666666667

Three hours later I realized that I still had more than an hour to go, and I wasn't bored yet. But that's what we've come to expect with Jackson's extended editions.

The extensions in the movie flesh out scenes in The Shire, in Rivendale, and in the Goblin Kingdom. For serious fans every additional moment adds to the movie -- including several more songs that are drenched in the Tolkien tradition.

Much as I'd like to get my own copy of the Desolation of Smaug as soon as it comes out, it's worth waiting for the extended edition.",1393459200,,647,4.338842975206612

THE MOVIE ITSELF...EXCELLENT!  5  stars.

the special edition DVD - 1 STAR.!!!!!!!!

why is the 'special features' DVD so annoying, couldn't they have made the extras dvd more of an interesting learning experience like they did with the lord of the rings movies?  also, the first hobbit movie had the same really annoying ""special features"" too  - just crew/cast members constantly joking around the entire time, and every second, a new scene to look at, and nothing to really take in.

immature.  if you are going to create a special features dvd it is ok to put bits - SOMETIMES - of the actors having a good time, cutesy cutesy, funny hee hee ha ha  in......but not ALL THE TIME THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DVD.

Also, I found the added characters to be annoying and an s big waste of time. Plus, they pretty much turned Gandalf in to Optimus Prime for the too frequent and drawn out action scenes.

The bluray transfer is superb, and as usual, the commentary tracks available are interesting and informative.  I suppose my only minor complaint with the extended edition itself, is that I didn't really notice too much extended content.  Other than a few added shots and a new song by the Goblin King, the movie seems pretty much the same as the theatrical version.  That's fine though, it's still a fun ride.

When ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" finally hit the theaters, I was more than ready.....but disappointed in a number of aspects....I felt it was at times too unrealistic (per Jackson's previous LOTR standards) and even cutesy (even considering the story was written as a children's story).  I am ashamed to all the other LOTR fans out there that I did not feel compelled to buy this first Hobbit film on disk, and I didn't rush to see the second Hobbit film in the first few hours it hit the theaters like I have done with the prior films.  But when I eventually saw the second film (The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug""), my passion and hope were re-kindled!
Since Peter Jackson is back on track, I had to buy this to keep my collection up-to-date.
This Extended Edition (like the LOTR ones) is not just for the devout fan.  Although it makes watching a film more of a time commitment, the added/extended scenes add much and makes the storyline much easier to follow for one who has never read the books.  For everyone, the Extended Edition makes for such a more enriching journey into Middle Earth.  In the case of this first Hobbit film, it helps the film rise to the level of the LOTR and second Hobbit films.
The Bilbo/Gollum statue is a very nice resin piece of substantial weight and size.  When shopping retail for something like this, I am a perfectionist and if able try to look at each package and choose the one I think has the best paint job....especially faces.  Obviously, I couldn't do that via Amazon.  However, I am very happy with the painting and overall quality of the statue!  IF there was a ""better"" one on the warehouse shelf, I will never know the difference!  Overall, a good buy.

4633034,1,B0059XTU1S,"Well, not entirely unexpected...

Travesty - a false, absurd, or distorted representation of something.

Director Sir Peter Jackson's prior reworking of a few elements of The Lord of the Rings, reworkings that telegraphically but tellingly indicated Jackson's profound miscomprehension of the material he was dealing with, were clues that Jackson's bona fides as nuncio of JRR Tolkien's mythic vision were very, very, very tenuous - at best. While I enjoyed the LotR films, I don't consider them classics so much as more or less providentially lucky strikes.

But here, we enter a new world - a world in which Jackson compels his actors and actresses and special effects gurus and everyone connected with this film to become his unwitting instruments for leaving his metaphorical spray all over Tolkien's pristine Middle Earth. Jackson in effect takes a work of Shakespeare and turns it into Pee-wee's Big Adventure, takes a work on the sublime level of Mark Twain and ""translates"" it down to the crass level of Adam Sandler. If you relish that sort of thing, the caricaturing and travesty of something resplendently beautiful into something frenetically tacky, or are willing to look past it, you may enjoy this film. It is not without good, even inspired, moments. If we can believe his statements affirming so, and we have no reason not to, Peter Jackson spent considerable time in personal research acquainting himself with JRR Tolkien's writings in preparation for filming. If Jackson has rode roughshod over and taken astonishing liberties with Tolkien's vision, it was not through ignorance but through choice.

Jackson is acknowledged as a serious artist and talented director. For example, in 2003, his movie ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" was nominated for - and received - 11 Oscars. Jackson began his career directing dark comedy, slapstick horror, twisted spoofs, and macabre tales such as the films Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, Braindead, and Heavenly Creatures. Directing travesties, in other words, of healthy normal characters and situations. One amazon reviewer (Mark Pollock) describes Meet the Feebles thus: ""If you enjoy watching puppets curse, vomit, defecate, urinate, fornicate, come down with venereal disease, do drug deals, do drugs, and shoot each other up with machine guns, then this film is right up your alley. It is NOT a children's film, that's for sure."" Jackson's directorial career has been accoladed with three academy awards, and even a knighthood from his homeland of New Zealand. But a simple understanding of and ability to convey virtue have *never*, EVER, been strengths of Jackson's resume.

Have I been wordy? In fine, this film is the apotheosis of shlock.

Jackson's ""Meet the Hobbits"" has moral decadence written all over it, a mishandling of pure things by Jackson's impure hands. As Joseph Pearce, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bilbo-s-Journey-Discovering-the-Hidden-Meaning-in-The-Hobbit/dp/1618900587/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bilbo's Journey: Discovering the Hidden Meaning in  The Hobbit</a>, puts it, ""Peter Jackson does not understand virtue"". The film makes one reflect not so much upon the mystery of Middle Earth as upon the mystery of Peter Jackson. The film explores this mystery extensively. If you are someone greatly fascinated by Peter Jackson, this film is perhaps the perfect vehicle. You will learn a lot. Certainly much more than you will learn about JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit - for example, Peter Jackson's idea of casting the dwarf Bifur with an axe stuck in his forehead. Jackson's conceptual designer for this film has remarked that, for Jackson, ""the film is almost incidental really"". Incidental to what, seems a valid question. Incidental to Peter Jackson's self-expression, seems a valid answer. As another amazon reviewer (Knight Rain) puts it: ""The book is filled with mystery and charm. The movie is a neurological attack on the mind."" Then there is Christopher Tolkien, JRR Tolkien's son, currently the world's foremost authority on Middle Earth, who comments thus on Peter Jackson's work: ""They [Sir Peter Jackson and Co.] gutted the book, making an action movie for 15-25 year olds.... This level of marketing reduces to nothing the aesthetic and philosophical significance of this work. And it seems that The Hobbit will be the same kind of film.""

And there's the rub: For there are those among us who consider JRR Tolkien's book The Hobbit a very fine work of art indeed. We feel stories such as The Hobbit are rare. Very rare. And we consider that if handled they should be handled with care - because there are very few beautiful things in this world. JRR Tolkien stated, ""The Lord of the Rings is a fundamentally religious and Catholic work"". It follows much the same is true of The Hobbit. You may say, ""So what?"" I will reply, the essence of Tolkien's Middle Earth IS virtue. Not travesty. Soul, not decadence. Tolkien's world is full of tales of heroism and beauty. It is a world of oral tradition and loveliness and grace - mysterious grace. For example, Tolkien's comment in chapter five of The Hobbit (Riddles in the Dark), that ""[of course] the riddle game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played it"". Find that spirit in this film. You cannot. Which is why I propose you cannot find Tolkien in this film. Only Peter Jackson.",1391990400,53,5451,5.2217142857142855

The action scenes and some other elements are overblown and not always true to the original story. On the other hand, there were lovely, brilliant moments like the dwarves' song.

4633116,5,B0059XTU1S,"I won't wade into the war currently being waged between Tolkien ""purists"" and Peter Jackson loyalists over the changes Jackson made to Bilbo's story as told in this film adaptation. At least not very deeply. Suffice it to say that these changes are many, and some of them are HUGE departures from the original story that were hard for me to swallow the first time I saw this movie in a cinema.  However, I have to say that much of the extra footage in this Extended edition is crucial, and I wish it had been included in the theatrical version. If you are wondering if the $10 extra for this Extended edition is worth it, I would answer that as an unqualified ""yes"". If you have never seen this film, and your purchase of this BluRay will be your first viewing of it, let me just say that Martin Freeman does a very good job of portraying a younger Bilbo Baggins; he doesn't look like Ian Holm did as Bilbo in LOTR, but I think he projects the spirit and attitudes of Tolkien's Bilbo very nicely. If you can accept that this film was made to: 1. make oodles of money for the producers, and 2. appeal to and entertain as wide an audience as possible, and if you keep it in mind that 80 years have passed since J.R.R Tolkiien wrote the original story, hopefully you can keep an open mind about Peter Jackson's handling of the plot lines and story and just enjoy it as an entertainment.
You might want to consider that the additions in this film flesh out some characters, like Radagast and Saruman, that were barely mentioned in Tolkien's novel of The Hobbit, and that other changes add links to tie The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings together more seamlessly. Whether or not these changes were TOO drastic is up to you to judge, personally, I appreciate the extra element of pure storytelling pleasure I got from most of Jackson's additions.
I also want to note that Ian McKellan (Gandalf), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Andy Serkis (Smeagol/Gollum), and Christopher Lee (Saruman),  all reprise their LOTR characters wonderfully, and the fact that this movie actually takes you inside the White Council (which the novel just barely mentions), is great, and I'm glad that Peter Jackson provided time for it in the screenplay.

More depth, more feel, cuteness, laughter, jokes, music...and even stronger development of the Necromancer subplot.

Nevermind the HiDef more than compensates, and there is no risk of motion sickness. Also you cannot beat viwing it on the large screen.

Visually it is breath taking.  By all means get the blue ray to get all of the extras.  Like when done with Tolkien's books you mind screams 'More! More!', so with the movies your mind screams 'More!

4633312,5,B0059XTU1S,"Strangely , this movie is underrated. It is brilliant.

It holds up very very well with the first LotR trilogy, and even surpasses it in terms of technical artistry. With regards to story , and as a film as a whole, it is an adventure tale very well told - fun, thrilling, engaging and even surprising.

Where the film definitely succeeds is in placing itself very snugly and confidently in the same universe as Peter Jackson's LotR trilogy, while maintaining a separate and distinct tone unto itself - a tone more suited to younger audiences than the first trilogy. This of course is in entirely in keeping with the different tones of the Hobbit and Tolkein's later, darker series. Make no mistake though, adult audiences will find themselves fully entertained.

If there is one thing to concede about this film, it is that it has a longer running time/length than your average movie. As a film-lover I fail to understand this as a complaint in an of itself, as my feeling is that if a film is this great, it is never long enough. This extended version of the film works supremely well, and is to me, the definitive version.

The blu ray transfer looks phenomenal, and the extras are many times more generous than most other dvd/blu ray offerings, in keeping (mostly) with the packaging of Jackson's LotR trilogy of extended film sets. If it is lacking anything , it is that there is only one filmmakers commentary, instead of a few, as per the LotR sets.",1391212800,,1456,4.631782945736434

4633369,5,B0059XTU1S,"I would have given it 4.5 stars. Only because it has just Director's and Writer's Commentary (which is great and allows the viewer to understand some of the reasons for the changes in this film as opposed to how the novel was written). I wish it had the multiple Commentaries that we have from the LOTR trilogy with the actors and Visual Effects people, as well as the Writer's and Director.
Other than that the film and it's features are great.
But overall it deserves 5-stars. That is why I left it that high.

Many people gripe about the Extended Edition having ""only 12 minutes of added scenes"". However, those scenes make a difference in the story.
They are great. They explain some things that we were not privy to in the Theatrical Version. Like why the Elves and the White Council is against Thorin's quest.

Is this a ""faithful retelling of the children's book""? No.
In my opinion it is a better telling. The book is made for children and is very good. However, it leaves out a lot of information that can only be found in the Appendices of LOTR (one needs to read LOTR Apendices to find out some of the things that happen during 'The Hobbit' because he never added it to that book. Pain in the butt). Plus, it has already been done as a 1970's animated film, in terms of ""faithful"".
That version, while visually interesting (lots of colors), still misses a lot of marks. Making Elves creepy, grotesque, grey-skinned, three-toed, short beings is wrong all around. The goblins are not large, horned, pig-dog creatures with big mouths, either.
In those ways the animated film *really* misses the mark for ""faithful adaptation"". Yet there are many people who say they want Peter Jackson's films to be more like that animated film, and like the book. Which is kind of slow, and has very little character development.
This movie (and 'The Desolation of Smaug') is much more interesting and adventurous.
I approve greatly.

I know he probably won't do it, but I would love a PJ version of 'The Silmarilion', too. But I know the Rights would be a pain to get, and their is no real linear story line to that book. But, in my opinion, Peter, Fran, and Phillipa could pull it off. Even if they got a different director.

Now for the Product critique:
Very good product. Sturdy disks, and wonderful artwork. The case is quite strong, and sits nicely with my LOTR Extended, Platinum Editions.
It arrived within a week in a sturdy box. No damage anywhere. No scratches. Wonderful service. Great product.
I am looking forward for the Extended Edition of 'The Desolation of Smaug' (Hopefully that will have Commentaries from the actors as well as Peter and Phillipa).",1391126400,,2661,4.667377398720682

This film has a very dark tone to it, with very excessive images, but the things that truly bugs me is the fact that it shifts back and forth from dark to comical too quickly, taking away some of the mood. Still, I highly enjoyed watching this film and the cliffhanger is incredible. I cannot wait for part 2 of this trilogy. It is no match for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but on it's own, it really has something going for it. It was also nice to seem some pretty awesome cameos from familiar faces. Overall, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is 100% worth it!",1391040000,,943,4.425287356321839

4633535,3,B0059XTU1S,"In Tolkien's own words, this is the ""story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. ""  This formula has delighted readers for decades, combining adventure with a story of personal growth.  Why would anyone tamper with such success by adding subplots that are not relevant and shift the focus away from the title character?  This isn't just a movie about how Bilbo became a hero and acquired a ring of power.  It's also about Thorin and the rise of Sauron.

If you add an element to the plot, show how that element relates to the story.  Azog and his vendetta against Thorin do not contribute to the central quest motif, nor are they necessary for adding peril--the company already encounters numerous dangers along the way.  If Jackson is using the orc to show us something about Thorin's character, it's unclear what that is, and the flashback about Thorin's fight with Azog interrupts the flow of the main story.

Tolkien mentions the Necromancer of Dol Guldur (I.e., Sauron) in the book, but chose not to discuss him or the workings of the White Council because these didn't bear on the story he was telling.  Neither do they relate in this movie, but are included presumably to make The Hobbit more of a prelude to Lord of the Rings.  Unfortunately, Jackson does not handle this addition deftly.  Radagast is the sort of character many find annoying.  Some reviewers have even dubbed him Jackson's Jar Jar Binks.  The meeting of the White Council, in which we might expect some compelling discussion, turns out to be a tepid exchange among characters who lack any real life.  Yes, Christopher Lee superbly conveys Saruman's arrogance and disdain, allowing Ian McKellan to make Gandalf appear a bumbler in contrast, but their exchanges lack any passion.  Cate Blanchett's Galadriel sounds like she's stoned, with her dreamy voice, and she wanders around the chamber as if in a daze, periodically whispering in Gandalf's mind.  Elrond briefly speaks out against disturbing the peace, but then is silent.  No one questions Saruman's opinion.  Where is the interesting discussion, the dissent, the persuasion, the emotion that would make this scene interesting?  What we get is ""I want to get rid of the dragon.  Don't ruin the peace.  I have proof from Radagast that evil things lurk in Dol Guldur.  The only evil things in Dol Guldur are the mushrooms Radagast's been eating.  Meeting adjourned."" Again, Jackson should have shown us a connection between the rising menace of Sauron and the expedition to Erebor.  At the council meeting, we could have learned that Gandalf was instructed to help the dwarves. The council knew Sauron had returned and didn't want him gaining Smaug's allegiance.  Saruman could have been presented as hiding his motives from the others, creating intrigue.

But the movie suffers from more than just adding superfluous detail to an already sufficient and engaging story.  It also suffers from Jackson's penchant for extending scenes too long and including too many Pirates of the Caribbean-style gimmicks to the action.  The introduction alone is 13 minutes long, compared to the concise seven minute opening of ""Fellowship.""  Tighter editing throughout would have greatly improved the pace, the tension, and the impact of events.

Perhaps the most unfortunate thing is that Martin Freeman's brilliant portrayal of Bilbo gets lost amidst all the extraneous detail and overblown action.

Given that Jackson's bloated remake of ""King Kong"" flopped epically, you'd think he would have returned to the clear, crisp storytelling of 'Lord of the Rings' for ""The Hobbit.""  Sadly, he did not.

Two tiny questions:  why would Elrond welcome the dwarves in elvish, and why would he allow his armed warriors to trot circles around people he knows are guests?",1390780800,,3837,5.038095238095238
4633536,5,B0059XTU1S,"If you're not into buying the box sets with all the extra for the extra $$$$, then purchasing the individual CD is a cheaper route and works just as well.  Especially since you have already seen the movie in the theatre by now.",1390780800,,227,4.27906976744186

4633562,4,B0059XTU1S,"Fans of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings trilogy know you never buy the films upon initial DVD or Blu-ray release because there will be an extended edition that follows.  The extended edition of The Hobbit checks in at a mere 182 minutes, 13 minutes longer than the theatrical cuts while the LOTRs extended cuts were 30  45 minutes longer in length.  Of course, a lot of people may say that an extended edition is totally unnecessary considering a single novel (and a relatively short one at that) is being stretched into a trilogy.  Unlike the LOTRs extended editions which add important elements to the film, such as the parlay with the Mouth of Sauron before the gates of Mordor, the additional scenes are more like the garnish on the dinner plate.  They might make it look pretty but ultimately you toss them aside.

Im not going to go into many details and analysis of the film itself.  Yes its a highly padded version of Tolkiens novel but the film adds elements and plotlines from The Lord of the Rings that didn't appear in those films.  Radagast the Brown who was barely mentioned in the Hobbit and the LOTRs plays a much larger role in the film.  In Middle Earth history it was Gandalf that investigated the abandoned fortress of Dol Guldur, in the film it is instead Radagast that discovers the fortress is inhabited by a Necromancer, i.e. Sauron.

So with that said, lets quickly cover some (but not all) of the additional and extended scenes that comprise the extra 13 minutes:

- Peter Jacksons daughter Katie plays a hobbit, along with the films production designer Dan Hennah as Old Took. Its also in this scene that we see a four-year old Bilbo playing with Gandalf as he releases his famous fireworks.

- More footage of Bilbo in the Shire prior to the Dwarves arrival.

- We get more footage of the Dwarves raiding Bilbos pantry

- Additional footage of the dwarves feasting in Rivendell as a beautiful Elf maiden plays a harp.

- Additional footage of Gandalf and Elrond discussing how Gandalf found the sword Glamdring and of a Dwarves singing a lively song

- Bilbo overhears a conversation between Gandalf and Elrond in Rivendell discussing their quest.  Maybe the most important of the additional scenes.

- Another important scene between Gandalf, Elrond, Galadrial, and Saruman discussing the fate of the seven rings of power that were given to the Dwarves.

- After being captured by the Goblins, its discovered that the dwarf Nori stole several items from the elves in Rivendell including a candelabra that the Goblin King finds and discards.

Extras

No one does extras like Peter Jackson and the Extended Edition Blu-Ray is filled with over eight hours of new material.

4633580,4,B0059XTU1S,"After years of waiting and nearly an entire decade since one of the greatest trilogies was completed, Peter Jackson returns to the directors chair and takes us back to a more simpler time in Middle Earth.

'The Hobbit' is one of the most cherished of all tales, about a Hobbit named Bilbo as a wizard named Gandalf and his band of 12 dwarfs pay him a visit and ask him to join them on a quest to take back their home from an evil dragon.

This was a film all of us LOTR fans were waiting of and yet, what was expected as two films will now become three. 'An Unexpected Journey' makes us all feel young again as if reading the book for the first time. The film is much different from the LOTR and incorporates a lot of the light hearted elements in the original material. Songs from the book are sung, riddles are flung back and forth in Gollum's cave and yet there is a lot more than just what is taken from the book. With three films in total Peter Jackson turns this film into much more of an epic than it is. Adding from Tolkein's appendices, and adding much more foreshadowing to what will come eventually in the story. The film has some returning cast members such as Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis. Still, the new comers such as Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Richard Armatage as Thorin have filled the shoes of a whole new cast of Middle Earth characters.

In Summation, the film does not reach the levels as the original trilogy, but then again it is the beginning of its own brand new trilogy. It is a lot of fun with some great moments and plenty of Middle Earth history you can sink your teeth into. Once the film ends all you can do is hold your head high in anticipation for the next part of this brand new adventure.",1390521600,,1739,4.263636363636364
4633581,4,B0059XTU1S,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""An Unexpected Journey"" (A.U.J.) in the theater. I think I enjoyed it even more watching it again on Blu-ray. But when I saw The Desolation of Smaug in the theater, I found justification for choosing this slashed-price bare-bones release of The Hobbit over the much more expensive extended cut. First, I wanted to save money. I think the extended releases will be cheaper down the road when the project is finished. Second, I don't think I'm going to like the extended cuts very much. ""The Hobbit"" is not like ""The Lord of the Rings"" - ironically, because it's too much like The Lord of the Rings and not enough like its source. Up to this point, with all the material that's been added in by the writers, not enough feels authentic to me. Instead, it feels borrowed from the LotR movies. I don't just mean that it's not what Tolkien intended. Rather, I mean that the story seems to lack the emotional weight and inner life of the LotR films (which, in my opinion, largely surpassed Tolkien's work despite the subtractions that took place). What was imported into Tolkien's story here was only imported superficially. I hope that time and a complete trilogy will give me a better perspective.

I think ""The Hobbit: A.U.J."" works very well for what it is - an action-adventure film. It seems much more a prequel to the LotR movies than an attempt to be faithful to Tolkien's children's book. I only hope this trilogy doesn't get carried away in that regard. So far, it is going a bit too far for me to rate even this first movie and its Blu-ray release five stars.

The little bit of material they added looks like some stuff they picked up off the cutting room floor. There are like two additional songs, some goofing off in Rivendell, but that's about it.

There was a 60 second montage of Martin Freeman flipping the bird to the camera. Why would anyone want to see that?

Pacific Rimm did a great job of this in its movie whenever the settings were inside. I actually felt pulled into the room at times. The Hobbit has the potential to be so much more in 3D entertainment but this particular movie didn't achieve it. A good ""wanna be"" 3D. Movie producers please pay some 3D talent their worth.

5 stars for The Hobbit: Theatrical Release Blu-Ray.

3 stars...read on
First of all, I love LOTR and The Hobbit and can't seem to get enough of these movies. That being said, of the 19 or so additional minutes shown in this extended version, maybe 5 or 6 of those minutes added to the film and to my thirst for the world that I want to be consumed by.
We were spoiled with the LOTR extended versions, and I guess I had similar hopes that The Hobbit extended edition would take me back to those three years when the LOTR's came out. If you are a LOTR/Hobbit/Tolkien fanatic, stop reading...buy the extended version, is there really a choice in the matter? I guess if you have some problem with Peter Jackson's vision of this book, you are entitled to your opinion. I hear a lot of peeps ripping PJ in their reviews about inaccuracies with Tolkien's The Hobbit. Go read the book then, and stop watching the movie (really? if you want verbatim...try books on tape or something, I don't know...) I love both for what they are: 1) a book and 2) a film...but, I have no struggle in keeping the two artistic platforms separated (my apologies If you do). These days it just seems everyone thinks they could be film directors or something...that they know how to take a book and transform it into a movie.

Sorry, got a little off point there...

Overall, I gave this a three star rating as compared to LOTR extended editions (a standard that P.Jackson set, not me). For those that were hoping to get back on track where we left off in Dec 2004, this one falls a bit short. To the casual LOTR/Hobbit fan who is curious, if you already have the theatrical version you are probably going to be good to go without repurchasing. If you still don't own either the Theatrical or Extended edition...this movie is still a must own IMO, you might as well buy the extended version at this point.

4633691,5,B0059XTU1S,"Hi. Before I say anything else, I must give you a bit of a backstory. My big brother Johnny was my best friend for over fifty years. During that time, we saw a multitude of movies (our favorite thing to do together). But we rarely agreed on our number one favorite. My number one would be his number seven or so and vice versa. Only ""Thunderball"" all the way back in '65 was our agreed upon favorite.  Till  ""Fellowship of the Ring"". Then we both had the same number one favorite again. We weren't agreed on the two sequels, though we both loved ALOT of parts of them! By now, you're wondering where I'm going with this. By the time the first of the new Hobbit trilogy was released, I had lost my best friend and couldn't even work up the guts to see it. To return to Middle Earth without my best friend just didn't seem possible. Boy, was I wrong! Just before the release of the newest one, something told me to get the dvd of ""An Unexpected Journey"";watch it; then see ""Desolation..."" in theaters. And am I ever glad I did!
  The first movie is incredible, including a villain's henchman who rivals both Lurtz and Oddjob for the number one spot. Azog is so
hateful, he makes Darth Vader look like Charlie Brown. Yes, I realize that Tolkien purists will feel twinges of disappointment with the new material. And that's fine. But for me, what Peter Jackson has done with the first movie is to make it grow darker and darker as the story moves along. Also, I realize this is an odd comparison but, please, bear with me. ""Casino Royale"" is one of the shortest
of the Bond novels. Yet the film, which is terrific, adds ALOT of new moments while keeping others from the novel out. But it
fully captures the essence of the novel. Peter Jackson has done the same thing...and then some. (Heck, I'm hoping to buy a Blu-Ray player just to get all the extra stuff.) And if you think the first one is terrific, as I do, the second one is actually better! Yes, Jackson has added bits, even characters, to both. But he has done so seamlessly.
  Whenever I watch ""An Unexpected Journey"" I can almost feel my best friend's spirit watching it with me! And, when I saw ""Desolation..."" I could almost feel him in the theater. That doesn't happen very often. But, with BOTH of Jackson's Hobbit films it has...and then some. I personally can't give very many movies (actually less than a handful) that kind of compliment. And with Jackson's first two thirds of the new trilogy, I felt my friend's presence all day. That NEVER happens! Till now.
  I know A lot of people think the first one is slow to get going. But for me, Jackson had a massive task on his hands and purposely
made the first half hour or so, kind of light. But he needed time to build on how dark and heartfelt it gradually becomes. But, once
it gets going...WOW! So, in my opinion, you owe yourself this movie. The second, which is even better (a feat rarely accomplished by a sequel) needs the first one as a building block ( and a darned entertaining one too!) to get you hooked. His return to Middle Earth is spectacular! And, if you haven't seen it, you really owe it to yourself. It's a heck of a ride! And, for me, the highest praise I can give it is that my Johnny would have loved it too! Then again, since BOTH movies made me feel like he was right there, just like the old days, maybe he DOES love the first one as much as me. And maybe, just like me, he's already anticipating  the
dvd release of the second! I realize that some people were let down by Jackson taking over for Del Toro. Thank God he did!
NOBODY knows Middle Earth like he does. And the trip back there, thanks to his vision and Tolkien's original novel fitting so
well together, it is a blast! Please, see it if you haven't already seen it (or, even if you have, give it a second look). In my humble opinion, you won't be disappointed! Thanks for reading this...Rick",1390089600,,3893,4.358620689655172

4633719,5,B0059XTU1S,"i love tolkien and have quite some collectibles already (books, cds, blu-rays). this one is special, though.

i bought this extended version with the limited edition bilbo/gollum statue in december but only got around watching it yesterday. and this is my first amazon review EVER.

THE MOVIE: by far not the best tolkien movie by peter jackson (sort of excusable since ""the hobbit"" falls very short when compared to LOTR). it just takes so long for things to happen and evolve. caught myself looking at the watch a couple of times! but it is so beautifully made! especially towards the end; such beautiful shots! and also themes that are of great importance to tolkien are beautifully represented (courage in face of great danger; good x evil not being a battle of power/strength; believing in the good in people; arrogance, pride and greed leading to madness and wickedness; etc.). personally, i just love the way they respect and value some ""stupid"" details: ""in a hole in the ground lived a hobbit"" was the first line of the tolkien saga ever to be written; and they introduce and value it beautifully.

THE EXTENDED VERSION: what to expect of an extended version of an already too slowly paced movie?! lots of important/funny/revealing scenes cut from the theatrical version; absolutely a must have! i actually caught myself being far less bored than during the theatrical version. now there's a surprise!

THE SOUNDTRACK: howard shore (who already had written 88[!!!!!!!] musical themes for LOTR) wrote one of the most beautiful themes ever which is the song thorin sings in bilbo's house and then becomes a recurrent theme throughout the movie. simply beautiful. for those of you who aren't aware, shore creates a series of related musical themes that underline important information from the story. what i do NOT understand at all (and probably appalled shore himself) was the use of the nazgl theme at the end of the movie, when thorin faces azog the defiler. as soon as the song started i naturally expected a nazgl to appear, following the logic of the tolkien/shore/jackson soundtracks so far. of course a nazgl at that point is absurd. i had hoped that they would correct that for the extended version, but that was not the case. :/

THE BILBO/GOLLUM STATUE: the actual reason i purchased this version was because of the statue. unfortunately i didn't pay attention that there was also the same statue on the 5-disc blu-ray extended version; i would've gotten that one. the statue is BEAUTIFUL! i didn't really know what to expect. but it is now the center piece of the (upright) piano that belongs to my wife in our living room and she had no objections to that, lol! (needless to say she is not the biggest tolkien fan)

VERY IMPORTANT: amazon does not state the languages featured in this extended blu-ray. there are 3 spoken languages: english, french and portuguese!!! and 4 different subtitle versions: english, french, spanish and portuguese! i have many friends in brazil who would have bought it had they known. well bad for you, amazon.com!

5 stars not for the movie, but this extended limited edition blu-ray! =)",1390003200,,3137,4.8964218455743875

I also liked the making of the movie and the clips of Hobbit 2, though I wish they put Hobbit2&3 together (it's like Harry Potter 7part1 and 7part2 wait and see them both together and they really could cut some scenes or quickened them).  Streaming is so much better than DVDs!  No skips, no damaged areas.  DVDs remind me of the old 64mm school movies that bunched up and jammed in the projectors.  Streaming is the way of the future and I'm looking forward to getting rid of all my players.

4633755,5,B0059XTU1S,"Overall the pace of this one is a bit forced and I think 2 movies would have been better than 3, But I am very pleased to get a chance to go Back to Middle Earth again. One caveat is that this is not so much the Hobbit as it is a set of Prequels for the Lord of the Rings. If you realize that you will enjoy the movies more, I think. That being said, Peter Jackson did a good job fleshing out the rest of the dwarves which was more than you can say for Tolkien's original work I also liked the fact that we get to see more of what Gandalf was up to when he abruptly left the dwarves on their own..

I bought ""The Hobbit"" on DVD when it first came out and have enjoyed it ever since.  I re-purchased it in ""Extended"" blue ray form a year later, and while having two copies of the flick feels like over-kill, I have no regrets.

The book was published Sept 21, 1937. It was written in a classic read-aloud fairy tale style (you can hear the voice of the narrator as you read it); Tolkien loved oral tradition, and this echoes it. By the time he'd developed the rest of his mythos (Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and more), he'd developed a more detailed, intricate style and had ""discovered"" more characters, and details of Middle-earth's history.

PJ's film adaptation draws from the other more detailed works of MIddle-earth to create a Hobbit with depth, realism and character development unseen in the book. The addition of a few original characters only adds to the epic awesomeness.",1389571200,,755,4.984126984126984

Apart from the added import tax, I'm still delighted with this set.

 The film itself was innovative and exciting, I know many people were not keen on the 48 frame format but i thought it gave a new dimension & all credit to Peter Jackson for trying something new.

I've seen these movies probably well over 100 times. He brought them to life, realistic life.",1389398400,,478,4.382022471910112
4633895,3,B0059XTU1S,"Well, I did an ""about-face"" on Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy (from hating it to liking it a lot, if not loving it)  so, who knows, maybe I'll feel the same way about this first installment of his HOBBIT trilogy after I see what he does with the other two films. At the moment, though, I think it neatly breaks down into pluses and minuses for me, and rather than enumerate all of them, I'll just go straight to my main complaint with this film and, indeed, with all of Jackson's forays into J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth so far.

Even taking into account that movie adaptations always take some liberties with the stories they adapt from the original print sources, why does Jackson continually feel the need to add in elements that not only weren't in the original but add nothing to the retelling? Does the viewer really need to know more about Radegast the Brown apart from his name, which is all he is in Tolkien's original book? Do we have to have Jackson's clownish envisioning of that character, based on nothing but a few references to him in Tolkien's writings and ending up in the movie being more Disney than Tolkien? Why do the references from the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy crop up throughout? Did Jackson have no faith that the original source of THE HOBBIT, namely Tolkien's book and written well before the trilogy, would've had sufficient backbone to tell what really is a cracker of a tale without help?

In the end, the movie comes off all right because the actors, the scenery and----to a limited extent----the script all work to create a world that works in the movie to tell JACKSON'S version of the tale. And if audiences enjoy that kind of compromise, fine. To me, though, it comes across as more of a ""fanboy"" movie, one made by someone who couldn't wait to ""fix the mistakes"" Tolkien supposedly made. I think I probably enjoy the movie best on that level, but I hope someday someone will try their hand at it again and trust Tolkien's original vision just a little more while they retell it. It could happen, you know...didn't Peter Jackson himself remake KING KONG?",1389398400,,2102,4.6

When it comes to the Extended Edition blue ray collection of videos I am very pleased with all aspects from packaging to content, and there is a lot of content.

Just using the closed captioning has allowed me to get past a lot of the ""english"" being spoken and gain some new appreciation for the clever interplay between the characters!

I will not support such an inhumane movie! While I enjoy The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, I'm not a die hard fan like some. Even so I would not watch the Hobbit for the poor treatment of all the animals in the movie. Up to 27 animals were killed in a painful death due to this movie being filmed & the enclosures they were kept in!

Here is a link to prove it - [...]The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) Twenty seven animals including goats and sheep were said to have perished from dehydration, exhaustion or drowning on a New Zealand farm during filming.

I'm a caring sensitive person and no money is worth the pain those animals suffered. I will not watch this Hobbit or any future movies and my copy of Lord of the Rings went straight in the trash (recycle). I will no longer support anything Peter Jackson has produced from Lord of the Rings to the Hobbit in this lifetime.

If I had to buy it over again, I'd buy the Extended version that was a Blu-Ray DVD, Regular DVD, and then a supplemental DVD (so 3-disc set) with all the extras on it.

I actually enjoy watching this more than any of the LoTR trilogy movies. Those movies are great as well, but this movie is one I can watch over and over again almost daily and it still piques my interest.  I cannot get bored of watching it.  I had watched the theatrical version at least 60 times before watching this extended cut (NO JOKE).  Watching the extended cut seemed a weird experience for me at first, as I was not used to all the new scenes. I am still getting used to it.  I am not sure if I like this better than the theatrical cut yet but this is the one I watch now over and over again.  I was a tad disappointed that all of the extended scenes were added into the first half of the movie only.  Once you get past around mid point, when the action heats up, the movie is exactly the same as the theatrical version.

4634053,3,B0059XTU1S,"I am generally a fan of extended versions of movies, but in this one I am disappointed. First of all, I really like the theatrical version of Hobbit AUJ. This DVD version offers about 19 extra minutes, of which only two short scenes add any substantive value. The first additional footage takes place as Old Bilbo (Ian Holm) begins writing his exploits. The additional footage of hobbit life and his family issues are boring and uninspired. The next major batch of additional scenes occurs when the Bilbo and the dwarves reach Rivendell. Only two scenes stand out in a positive light, Bilbo's verbal sparing with Elrond and when Bilbo, along with Thorin, overhear Gandalf and Elrond discussing the dwarves' quest. The remaining scenes of dwarves bathing in an elven fountain, being generally obnoxious, and the elves complaining about how much wine dwarves drink are not only unnecessary (dwarvish behavior and eating habits had already been established at the Bag End dinner), but actually detract from the pacing. There may have been some changes to the White Council scenes, but I was uninterested enough to do a comparison.",1388966400,,1127,5.032085561497326
4634084,4,B0059XTU1S,"Of course those of us who love LOTR have to watch this movie, and unlike with the Harry Potter film adaptations, these movies stay very true to book.  Moreover, by splitting The Hobbit up into three long movies, no details need be omitted at all!  I see this film (series) as an experiment in film adaptations of much-beloved books, and my conclusion is that, sometimes, I want to see the whole story in a single feature-length film, but for such epic novels as LOTR, maybe such brilliant directors as Peter Jackson can get away with this multi-movie (billion-dollar-making) business.

Bottom line: for those of us who have to watch it (because we just have to), I think you'll enjoy the time spent.",1388966400,,699,4.713114754098361
4634085,5,B0059XTU1S,Peter Jackson's brilliant vision combined with the stellar cast to bring JRR Tolkien's world to life. This journey through middle earth is a bit more light hearted and fun.

As I said, all of them made it feel very believable.  Also I am going to add that the film is visually stunning and the 3D takes it to another level.",1388966400,,460,3.913978494623656

Great Cinematography.  Great characters... what more could you ask for in a movie from Hollywood?  This is like complaining about a meal from a Michelin chef when you're used to eating at McDonald's... I feel like I've been starved for a movie just like this.  Something that makes you so excited to see the next movie in the trilogy.  A movie that pays homage to both JRR Tolkein's plots and characters, but also the magnificence that was the original LOTR trilogy.

I think people are just so used to watching garbage, that they don't understand that it takes a little time to tell a good story, build suspense, create expectations and make you care about the characters.  Again, thank you Mr. Jackson.  You are awesome!",1388880000,,880,4.69281045751634

4634096,5,B0059XTU1S,Peter Jackson has copied tolkiens appendices idea in the form of a behind the scenes documentaries. Altogether there is about 7-8 hours of additional content that is really an enjoyment to see because you get to see the stories and going ons that you won't get anywhere else.

Overall, they tried to stick to most of the plot and actually did do justice to the many characters.  I could have done without the excessive violence but I suppose that's what is needed to bring in larger audiences.
As it's a PG-13 rating, scary images, and excessive violence, I wouldn't recommend this movie to children under 10.",1388880000,,465,4.716049382716049

4634121,4,B0059XTU1S,"This is a great package because it literally comes with every format for your viewing pleasure. It comes with the blu-ray, 3D blu-ray, DVD, and UV (ultra violet which is streaming on devices such as a computer). This is nice for when you want to watch a movie and you can't get to a certain device because someone's using it. Also works nice for people that like to have the option readily available to choose the 3D or regular version. I also like the case very much so. It's like a hologram almost. When you move it it looks like Gandalf is right there in front of you. It's an awesome package all around.

Now for the movie it's self. It is quite long. I almost fell asleep in theater watching it because that's what happens when you see a long movie at the midnight release. It's nice to own a long movie though because you can easily just watch half now and the rest of the movie another day. The whole world of 'The Hobbit' has the same look and feel as the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy which is nice. I do feel they did go a little more overboard with the CGI this time around but it was still a visually striking film none-the-less. I am a little puzzled on how they are stretching this book into 3 movies as the book itself is smaller than any LOTR book. I think I'm just going to wait for the next two movies to release for home viewing and enjoy all three movies for a couple of days. Probably two days per movie at the rate on how these movies are going. You don't want to tire yourself out and miss good scenes. I honestly think that now after everything's said and done the 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' movies could have been easily turned into an HBO series... but I guess that's why we have Game of Thrones :D",1388793600,,1732,4.201201201201201
4634122,3,B0059XTU1S,"I loved the Lord of the Ring's Trilogy, both book and movie. Those movies had substance, drama, and the action was not over the top and fight scenes realistic (as fantasy can be). This movie had none of that substance. Why was every action scene and even parts that were dramatic shown as a comedy or farce, when the had their first meeting? Minimal  character development.  And I will add this, these issues also occurred in the 2nd part of the Hobbit.  Why the gratuitous ""dwarves in the barrel scene"", with the elf jumping on their heads to shoot the orcs or goblins. The movie could have been much better.

I wish they had followed the same standard as the first three movies. Now, I will see them all, and have seen the second movie, but I was hoping for the same caliber of movie as in the first three. Maybe the final movie will redeem itself.",1388793600,,850,4.3949044585987265

I don't agree and they probably would have had a different viewpoint if this book had been dramatized ""first"" ahead of the TLOTR.  I know there has been much made about the fact that this single book is becoming three movies.  That is commercial hollywood, but also a strong desire on Peter Jackson's part to tell a really good story even for those who have never read the book.  That requires a lot of back story to fill in.

The problem with Jackson's Hobbit is the dwarves.  It's sad that only a handful of them are memorable after seeing the film.

Once I'd paid Parcel Forces rip off 'handling fee' & the UK's further rip off 'Import Duty' (that's the 'gripe's' over wiv! lol) I was left with a nice big box to open when I got home! First impressions first:The outer box is superbly detailed with lovely scenes taken from Art that has been done for this piece! You have to be careful opening the box as the carded slot is precise & will rip unless you lever it out a wee bit each side at a time! the opener is also on the side with the 'Info-printed sheet' so be careful you don't rip that too as its held on to the centre with those gooey glue blobs! Once inside you get the Blu ray set you can buy separately from the shops & then the piece! Yeeee Haaaaaa! It has a clear section that you can see the piece through & is sellotaped around that to the polystyrene main body. Be careful to gently, with a constant tension peel this tape off! Too fast & it will rip apart the polystyrene outer surface! The piece does want to flop out once the last of the tape comes away so have the polystyrene part to the bottom to avoid this. The piece comes out easily now BUT beware Bilbo's sword as it looks ever so easy to break! The piece is wonderful - equal to Weta's usual high standards & previous pieces available in the DVD days! Upon close inspection there are a few nice touches like the One Ring being on the ground infront of Bilb's feet-not noticeable until you take in everything. The colouring is good & Gollum/Smeagal has been done to scale & is upto previous charater design in other pieces! Its a Great addition to my Sideshow collection-I will be looking out for further pieces as the following movies are released! Quality-get 1 if you can! The JT ;o)",1388707200,,1808,4.274052478134111

4634174,1,B0059XTU1S,"I ordered ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey DVD + Ultraviolet Digital Edition"". I received the DVD of the Hobbit with no Ultraviolet Digital Edition. I contacted customer support and spoke with a very nice man who apologized for the error and said he'd ship a correct one out to me the next day. The next day I received instructions on how to return the original order and the new DVD. It was exactly like the old DVD with no Ultraviolet Digital edition. At this point it became obvious to me that the website product listing was in error. I contacted customer support again, spoke with a couple of people this time, both seemingly concerned, and was told that they'd send a replacement. I told them my suspicions about the erroneous listing and after holding for a while was told my suspicions were correct. I was told to keep the second DVD I received and that the customer support representative would contact me the following Friday after they had a chance to straighten the problem out. I was fine with that. Friday came and no contact. Monday and Tuesday came with also no contact. At this point life caught up with me and I had to do other things for a couple of weeks. Still no contact during the entire time.

Today I logged on to my Amazon account to initiate the return of the second DVD (I'd already returned the first one per instructions). The website would only allow me to return the DVD for a replacement not a refund. Although the price for the replacement was listed as $0.00 I'd already paid for the original DVD which I returned. A check of my credit card account verified that Amazon had never refunded my money for the original DVD. So now, my only option appears to continue this infinite loop of return the DVD for a replacement with the wrong DVD.

I've had a very heavy year of orders with Amazon in the past year. This is the third time in the last few months that they've screwed things up. Their customer service group is friendly but not particularly functional. I would have given this no stars had it been an option.",1388707200,,2050,4.508064516129032

Maybe I went in with high hopes because it was Peter Jackson and he did so phenomenally well with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it seemed amateurish...almost childish (the scene with the goblin king seemed like it was out of a kids movie!).

4634224,3,B0059XTU1S,"I wouldn't say that this movie was worth owning but before my eyes, I see the money and talent and superior skill that went into making it.  I'm not a Tolkien fan but this is very well done and visually, I enjoyed it more than the trilogy because of the reminders of Ironforge and the Scottish dwarves in World of Warcraft.

The extra 13 minutes are not that rewatchable but I guess it is human nature to want the extended version. I didn't particularly feel that they were needed or fleshed out the relationships as described but because I appreciate the hints at the Allied War against the Orcs, I have no regrets about picking the extended and I would recommend the extra 13 minutes over the theatrical release version.

Although Tolkien wrote this earlier, this movie made me wonder if Smaug wasn't Switzerland sleeping in the now homeless and deprived Dwarves' gold coins.

I was happy to find Crowded House's Neil Finn doing the song for the ending credits but again it was a very weird song/message - it seemed to be a declaration of war aimed at the old enemies of the Allies in World War.",1388620800,,1097,4.525252525252525
4634225,5,B0059XTU1S,"First I'll say that I am a fan of all of Jackson's Middle Earth movies and have seen them all multiple times. I was thrilled to hear that the Hobbit was finally being made, while I think the original 2 movie plan would have been better than a trilogy. The added scenes to the film are great, you get to see some more of the shire and the most important added scene, in my opinion, is the extension of the Dale scene. You get to see the fight between Smaug and the people of Dale, which is shown more in the latest Hobbit film. The added scenes helps the continuity between this film and the Desolation of Smaug, by showing the black arrows and the white stones that are mentioned by the Elf King. The Purist will call this Blasphemy, but the Hobbit films create a better continuity to the Lord of the Rings films than the Hobbit does to the Lord of the Rings. The extended edition is worth buying and the extras are great to watch. If you own the extended Lord of the Rings you should own the extended Hobbit films.",1388534400,,1015,4.237113402061856

Two bonus clips ""The Company of Thorin"" and ""Durin's Folk: Creating the Dwarves,"" contrary to what the packaging claims, are completely missing from these DVDs.  This was a big disappointment, because I was hoping to see how Peter Jackson (and company) brought the dwarvish race to life in the movie.

If you want these clips, I suggest you buy the 5-disc DVD deluxe set, which includes all the above clips, plus the appendices--just as Peter Jackson did for the LOTR triology--for only five more dollars.

4634228,1,B0059XTU1S,"I want to be clear that this is a review of the Instant Video product and not the content of the movie. I originally saw the movie in a theater and, although it is over-long and does not adhere to Tolkien's novel, it was entertaining. I wanted to watch it again before seeing the second installment in a theater recently.

The problem is this: There is apparently a known issue with this product and Sony Bravia TV's. The disclaimer was not displayed, to my knowledge, before I had purchased the product and attempted to play it on my Bravia television. The initial selection screen, which displays information about the movie and from which the user can select to ""play"", ""resume"", etc., included a disclaimer that said it may not work correctly on Bravia televisions and that they are ""working to resolve the issue"".

Having already purchased the product, I tried to view it. The movie played for about 30 minutes without issue, then it popped up and ""content error"" message. I selected ""Retry"" and it played for a few seconds before displaying the error message again. I tried this 4-5 times then gave up. I later tried selecting the movie to ""Resume"" play. It immediately displayed the error message again.

If you have a Sony Bravia television, steer clear of this product. I paid for it and cannot play it on my TV. I have also not found a way to return the product to get my money back.

I will eagerly await and watch all three, then I hope to buy a complete set of all the movies in one box. It will be a nice keepsake that I will likely revisit often. The prominence of Azog the Defiler is a wide deviation from the book, and I find that a little distracting.",1388448000,,604,4.260869565217392
4634292,4,B0059XTU1S,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

I know this sounds weird, but have you ever refused to watch a movie because you haven't read the book or play that inspired it, and therefore don't feel ready to see it?  For example, thats why (with the exception of The Sorcerors Stone) I never saw the Harry Potter octology (eight films) based on J.K. Rowlings seven novels.  How could my movie impressions compare with those who have immersed themselves in both the Harry Potter book AND movie mythos?  Ditto with J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings (LotR) novel trilogy and Peter Jacksons movie trilogy based on it: I haven't done the LotR reading homework (yet, but Id like to someday), so how can I presume to watch and fully appreciate and understand the LotR movies? I wasn't worthy, I wasn't worthy.

Then Peter Jackson announced many moons ago that he planned a movie adaptation of Tolkiens unofficial LotR prequel, the beloved, durable classic The Hobbit, and I subsequently became excited.  I HAD read The Hobbit and even critiqued it on Amazon.com, and so felt prepared to watch The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (hereafter Hobbit: AUJ) and even compare and contrast it with the novel, and discuss it with its numerous fans.  Then, I found out Hobbit: AUJ would incorporate origins of events (such as the White Council and the rise of the Necromancer) only barely alluded to in The Hobbit novel but more fully fleshed out in the LotR movie trilogy.  Furthermore, Jackson planned an epic 9-hour movie trilogy. My enthusiasm wavered.  I was starting to doubt I was prepared to watch THIS trilogy either, because I thought it would be altered, attenuated, and mixed up beyond recognition. Therefore, I missed Hobbit:AUJ in the theatres.

Recently, however, Hobbit: AUJ popped up on HBO, and I finally resolved to devote the time to seeing it. So, especially to those people who have read only The Hobbit, and even those who have read the unannotated, un-appendixed version, I can state with relief and happy surprise that Hobbit: AUJ remains largely and divertingly faithful to the roughly first 50% of the novel it covers.  It covers the various set-pieces (e.g. Gandalfs (Sir Ian McKellen) recruitment of the reluctant Bilbo for a territory-reclaiming and burgling adventure, the dwarves boisterous visit to Bilbos hobbit-hole, the encounter with the dull-witted trolls) with vigor, boisterous humor, and exquisitely rendered CGI action.  Even the preliminary explanation for the dwarves exile from their Erebor home by the barely glimpsed but still astounding dragon Smaug (though not explicitly in the novel) efficiently and rousingly sets up the hobbits adventure.  Yes, there are the lengthy LotR detours such as the wild-eyed, slovenly wood wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) only mentioned once by Beorn in the unannotated Hobbit) discovering the spiders and other evil forces of the Necromancer massing and the White Council including Gandalf, Elrond the Elvenking (Hugo Weaving), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) contemplating the Necromancers rise.  However, I did not find them all that distracting, and perhaps even a little bit useful if I ever tackle both book and movie LotR.

In general, no movie can be slavishly faithful to its literary source since they are two distinct mediums with distinct advantages and disadvantages.  The Hobbit: AUJ is certainly no exception.  A movie CAN take dramatic license with a books plot and characters provided it doesnt deviate too much from its spirit.  I think The Hobbit: AUJ largely succeeds in doing this.  I felt one of the main themes of The Hobbit novel is that no matter how small, timid, and uncertain you are, you can have the traits and courage to accomplish great things. In The Hobbit: AUJ, the younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) expresses that theme very well, and even improves upon it.

In the novel, many people might feel that Bilbo was too much of a reluctant hero, too whiny and complaining.  Remember in the novel when he practically curled into a quivering fetal position when Gandalf and the dwarves explain the danger of their quest?  In the movie, Bilbo merely comically faints.  Furthermore, in the movie Freemans Bilbo is more refreshingly and amusingly persnickety, fussy, and indignant than in the novel and shows his slowly receding unwillingness to go on the journey more admirably.  Still, some Hobbit novel purists may balk at Bilbos uncharacteristic slaying of a charging orc (also not in the novel) to save Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage).  It didn't bother me, because I saw it as the first, spontaneous manifestation of Bilbos growing Tookish resolve.  An even better and touching illustration of Bilbos resolve comes toward the end of the movie, after the eagles have rescued Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves from being besieged in fir trees by the hideous, slavering orcs and their wolf-mounts, the Wargs.  Bilbo, a complacent bourgeois home-owner, pities the dwarves nomadic homelessness and vows to help them reclaim their mountain home from the dragon Smaug.

So in conclusion, if, like me, you have read an unadorned copy of The Hobbit, you neednt fear that The Hobbit: AUJ has mangled and twisted the tale into an unknown shape.  It hasnt, and unless you are fastidious and nitpicky, you may enjoy some of Jacksons flourishes (such as the grotesque but eloquent Goblin Kings (Barry Humphriess) fat beard and his teeming underground kingdom) and still rest assured that The Hobbit: AUJ has mostly respected Tolkiens tale  at least so far.
Anyway, I now feel worthy and ready to see The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug in the theatre.  If nothing else, I think I will enjoy seeing Smaug the Tremendous, the Magnificent, and the Stupendous!",1388448000,,5742,5.076595744680851

I liked the dwarfs for the most part, but I have to say I didn't get as emotionally attached to them as I did the fellowship in LOTR. The same goes specifically for Thorin Oakenshield. I liked his story, and the actor did a nice job, but I wasn't as interested in him as I was Aragorn.

One of the things that PJ quickly takes care of is bridging the disparity in tone between The Hobbit, a children's book and the much more epic LOTR.  Since much like Gandalf in Moria he could not,go back he could only go forward, the movie is darker than the book.  If fans are really put off by the lack of proper hoods than they obviously do not see the difference between the two mediums of film and book.  A wonderful performance by sir Ian Mckellan, Martin Freeman, and all others including a great job by Andy Serkis as Gollum and as a second unit director.

4634463,3,B0059XTU1S,"Received this Extended Edition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (DVD) as a Christmas gift.  I had high hopes for this, as while I did enjoy the movie in the theater and found it to be entertaining and interesting, and not problematically slow, it failed to rise to the level of satisfaction I found in the LOTR franchise.  Unfortunately, the extended scenes fail to enhance the story or movie experience in the same way the LOTR extended versions really added to their respective installments.  The added scenes in the prologue and in Rivendell were probably the best part and much better appreciated.  The extended scenes in Goblin-town were not really noteworthy at all, and the Great Goblin's song, despite having its source taken more from the actual book, was almost embarrassing  to watch and definitely hurt the movie for me.  While I really did like the movie, these extended scenes weren't the big deal here that they are in the three LOTR films.
My three star rating is in regards to the extended scenes in particular.  I would give the total movie four stars as originally released.  Worth renting to see, or purchasing if you had not bought the original theatrical version last spring.  I would hesitate to recommend buying this movie again just to get the extended scenes, being so few and not adding much to the story or even degrading it some (Great Goblin singing that dreadful song) it just isn't worth buying again.",1388016000,,1437,4.808943089430894

Score a lose for the digital edition cloud-locker.

Part I covers the first third of the novel and definitely the magic is back. It wasn't easy I'm sure, the book is slim and leaves a lot unsaid. Jackson made a good choice in showing us the history of these dwarves, a Middle-Earth race that didn't get on screen in LOTR. He also brings to life the barely mentioned Radagast and the other creatures like the rock monsters. The big difficulty was to bring The Hobbit in line with the look of LOTR. Even in the books they are very different in many ways, even though Tolkien did make revisions to the Hobbit after LOTR was published to link them better. Really, most of the deviations from the book are still within the mythos. It is not to part 2 of the movie do we see the bulk of ""new"" additions such as adding Legolas to the story.  This extended edition doesn't add a whole lot, but a few of the additions tie in well with part 2. Is it necessary to see this movie in 3D? No, it is bigger than life as is.

4634480,3,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit -- let me preface my comments on the movie 'The Hobbit' with this: I first read the book around 1977, fell in love with it and proceeded to read it no less then TWELVE more times over the years (quite possibly more). I read the LOTR a dozen times or more also, learned to read and write runes as well as Sindarin Elvish and generally was a Tolkien geek. I collected copies of the books and coveted them like they were the 'one ring' and spent many an hour in the woods with friends in search of adventures usually carrying a broad ax (double bit 5lb ax with short haft) and machete (couldn't afford a sword). Ya, I was a Tolkien geek.

When the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) came out I had to go see it and went with great hopes. It was good though not exactly like the books and to me a little too much off the books in fact, but I overlooked the differences as 'artistic license' and was mostly happy with the movies. They were good (better in extended version) and worth watching despite the changes which for the most part were minor (though I'm still pissed about the whole Gandalf's staff being broken by the king of the Nazgul -- what nonsense). So, knowing that Peter Jackson was making The Hobbit I was pretty sure it would be good, a little different but mostly faithful to the book.

Little did I know I could be so wrong! It appears to me that Jackson thinks he knows better then Tolkien and he's made a total butchery of the story. In fact, the movie 'The Hobbit' only derives it's characters and rough timeline from the book, the rest is, well, pure fantasy as it were. Peter Jackson should be ashamed with himself and flogged publicly.

Having said all that, Jackson's new tale (which could be just as easily called something like 'The Dwarves' as much as 'The Hobbit') is entertaining if not completely different from the book.

Disappointment? Yes. Will I watch it again? yes. Should you go? Sure. Just don't expect to actually see 'The Hobbit' the way it should be and was written, this is something else and while entertaining it simply IS NOT true to the books in most ways.",1388016000,4,2100,4.390745501285347

The audio in this Blu-ray is superb, even in some of the quieter scenes inside the caverns with Gollum.  The images are are sharp and crisp, and I saw no motion blur.  The movie is the weakest of the Hobbit-themed movies, mostly because it is doing the set-up for the 2 movies to follow, introducing us to characters, and tying it to past Lord of the Rings movies, which all take place in this movie's future.  But if you are a fan, this is a well-done introduction for what follows.",1388016000,,581,4.452830188679245

For my 2, I felt Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was not as good of a movie as it could have been.  Truth be told, compared to Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, An Unexpected Journey didn't stack up all that well.  However, I commend Peter Jackson for making the film(s) in the first place.

Am quite amazed how Jackson was able to keep every aspect of the book in his movie, AND add in the right elements to actually make it exciting and fun.  Anyone that claims otherwise has not actually watched the movie, and is just trolling to get attention.

The acting is top-notch, the story is gripping (though spoiled if you have read the book).  The ""look"" of Middle-Earth is phenomenal.  This is a yardstick on how to measure new movies against greatness.

Jackson has once again proven that he can improve upon good source material and make it into a CLASSIC FOR THE AGES.

4634503,3,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey I find to be a decent film but rather padded.  When I heard that they were going to turn the Hobbit book into three movies I was rather skeptical.  Lord of The Rings was three novels so a trilogy made sense.  However, The Hobbit is only one book and is shorter than any of the LOTR novels.  If they separated it into two films like the final Harry Potter book it would have been fine, but a trilogy seems like a stretch.  They are going to be great changes, additions, and a great deal extended and padded.  This film feels very padded and seems like filler in many parts.

The film introduces the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), and the dwarves he will be traveling with including their leader and rightful king Thorin (Richard Armitage).  Gandalf (Ian McKellen) also returns as the leader of the expedition.  Ages ago the dwarves homeland Erebor was taken over by a dragon named Smaug.  Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, and the rest of the dwarves head for Erebor to take back their land while being hunted by Oarks, Goblins, and other dangers they encounter.

There are many things the film has going for it.  The acting is great from everybody.  Martin Freeman does an excellent job as Bilbo.  I can totally believe that he is a younger Ian Holm from LOTR.  Ian McKellen is awesome as usual.  He still plays Gandalf flawlessly.  Richard Armitage is also great.  Thorin is probably the first truly kickass dwarf we have had in all of the movies so far.  Gimli had some badass moments but he was the comic relief most of the time in LOTR.  The other actors do a good job as well.  The effects are amazing as always.  Peter Jackson movies always have great effects.  The action, when there is action is pretty fun and exciting for the most part.

However, much of this movie feels like filler like I said earlier.  The first part is introducing and reintroducing us to the characters and establishing each characters personality.  It is also devoted to explain the plot and mission.  The middle portion is just them walking from place to place while encountering a little danger here and there.  The LOTR films had a lot of walking to but it had more going on.  This film I felt did not have enough going on until the final act.  The action is not as exciting as LOTR either.  It feels more watered-down and lighter in tone.  It makes sense because the Hobbit was a lighter book than LOTR but it still did not get involved as much.  The action scenes in the goblin cave and the final action scene I thought were well-done though.

I also did not think the characters were as strong here.  I liked nearly every character in LOTR while here I only liked two.  Gandalf and Thorin were great but the rest I thought were pretty bland.  Freeman does a good job acting wise but I could not get into Bilbos character until the very end when he stops being so cowardly.  The rest of the dwarves are very forgettable.

Overall, the film is okay.  It is a decent introduction to the trilogy.  The acting is spot-on, the effects are great, and a few of the action scenes are fun.  The problem is that it is mostly setup and not much more.  It is definitely not as exciting as Fellowship of the Ring.",1387929600,2,3221,4.462199312714777

4634519,5,B0059XTU1S,"First, I'll review the packaging. It's presented very well with nice artwork along the sides of the box. The statue is very well protected using Styrofoam and air bubbles.

For the statue itself,it's incredible. I've never had any statues or props from weta workshop before so this was a no brainer.  On the bottom of the statue it has the film logos and the sculpture name ( Gary Hunt )  The statue itself is titled ""Riddles in the dark"" .  It's of Gollum and Bilbo on a rock, with fish scales and the One Ring on the ground. It's pretty weighty but not too heavy. The colors and paint are very well done, however mine has a couple stray marks ( which really doesn't bug me though)

For the blue ray box with the movies, I think it's nice but it could have been better. With the extended edition dvds of the Lord of the Rings,  you get a paperback book size DVD case with a slip cover, colored green, red or blue. It came with a sheet of paper that featured some lovely concept art, but also featured a map of the appendices and special features.  However this edition doesn't have that.

This edition features a standard size blue ray box in a nice slip cover featuring Bilbo. On the back of the slip case you have Bilbo's acorn symbol. Inside you have your UV code and a The Noble Collection booklet, but that's it. If you go to theonering.net they have a printout of a booklet similar to what they had with the extended edition dvds from LOTR.

As for the movie, I think it's wonderful. It's very lighthearted at times, just as the book is. The acting is top notch of course. I won't review the movie because I feel that if you are buying this edition, you've already seen it or you haven't seen the extended version,which I won't spoil, but I feel it's well worth it.

The special features are amazing. If youve seen the previous appendices, then you know what you'll get and you know it's a truly interesting experience. You see how every bit of the story comes  together. The two discs of the appendices are around 4:30 and 4:45 min long respectively. They are very well produced and you will not be bored.

To wrap up, if you've checked out the previous extended editions and loved them, then you'll love this. The statue is really impressive and well put together, and definitely looks good.  Thanks :D",1387843200,2,2311,4.422169811320755

4634522,5,B0059XTU1S,"I'm pretty sure that its hard for anybody not to like this. So, this review probably won't matter much to anyone (probably since there are, like, 3,500+ reviews on this move, so this review will probably get overlooked), but I'd still like to say a few things on how good this movie is.
First, I really like how close to the book it is. Sure, there is allot of dialogue added, and a few scenes that are added on to the original ones, but for the most part, the plot itself is pretty faithful to the book. I've seen allot of movies made off books that are just so messed up because they're, like, %95 different from the original book, and most of the scenes added are just plain stupid. But they don't do this here. Just goes to show how committed the makers of LOTR were carful to make this one just as good and pure as there previous LOTR trilogy. And for any scenes that were added on that weren't original, they're just as good as if they came from the original book.
Second, the characters are REALLY well developed and personalized. For example, in the original book, allot of the 13 dwarfs are only used one or two times, and it doesn't go into allot of detail about allot of them. But in the movie, they make each dwarf unique, and each one has there own memorable specialty that would make Tolkien proud. Its easier to connect with the characters in a story when you know each one well and are able to start caring for them. Tolkien wasn't able to do all of that, since he had so many characters to deal with in his story, but this movie shows the characters in full colors, showing there personality, special look and so forth. You can actually have a favorite dwarf in the movie, when in the book you didn't know each one will enough to decide.
And third, the movie itself is just really good. It seems like this days, all the movie producers will just take the cheap way out and do all there filming in the studio, but not in this movie. The previous producers of LOTR lived up to the legend of the previous Middle-Earth trilogy, making this movie a real, grand spectacle among allot of other movies made today. The wilderness scenes look so real, beautiful and captivating, and all the structures, buildings and such look very real. The clothing isn't done with cheap, very fake-looking material, but done with professional patterns that really fit into that world. The props used, such as weapons, hats, plates and other stuff also look quite real. And that's hard to do, as this movie was shot at a frame rate of 48 frames per second, making all the details really stand out. That means that they hade to pay extra attention to the detail of the sets, props and all the other aspects of the film. Really makes you appreciate more the work of its producers. And it does look fantastic.

So, with that said, it looks like this is a very great movie. Call it what you want; you may just not like it for the story, the characters, or anything like that. But you must gives high starts for its production; and I don't see how anybody could not like the story. I'm pretty sure that pretty much everybody has seen this move, so everybody should have there own opinion; but I hope that this review helps add on to your opinions and helps shape them more. I think I'll just close out with this: this is a very good film, and a masterpiece that surely stands out as one of the greatest films of all time.",1387843200,3,3408,4.375394321766562

When I purchased this, I had not watched the movie since December 2012, but I did enjoy it quite a bit in theaters. This edition adds about 13 extra minutes I believe, and a lot of that extra time is the inclusion of a couple more songs, from what I can remember about the theatrical version.

The 3d Blu-ray is excellent, but a bit of drag that it had to be split onto separate discs. Swapping discs does not greatly take away from the experience, and the swap point is at a logical place in the film. It's actually kind of bad ass when it cuts to black at the end of the scene and tells you to change discs to continue the journey.",1387670400,,746,4.180555555555555
4634558,4,B0059XTU1S,"I drank the Kool-Aid, so I will never say there is a bad Hobbit movie.  However, if you never read the books and don't plan to, these movies are great.  I groaned when they said they would made three installments.  I groaned more when I saw this one (and the second movie earlier today).  These two movies loosely interpret the events in ""The Hobbit"".  I won't talk details, but if you read the books, you would understand. (Legolas in the second movie?  Really, guys!?!?! Beorn given bits? Sorry, this is about the first movie.)  Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro are the best, but someone in Tolkien's family should have stood up and said, ""Enough is enough"".

I will say the casting was well done.  Each actor (first and second movie) did an excellent job of playing the role required of them in the movie.  (Maybe they were barred from reading the books so they would not get confused during filming. . .yes, that was a dig.)

So, if I rate it on the quality of the movie alone, I give it 4.5 stars.  If I rate it on accuracy, it barely gets 2 stars (being gracious, of course).",1387670400,2,1085,4.396984924623116

4634573,3,B0059XTU1S,"An Unexpected Journey is entertaining but bloated and frustratingly familiar.

The story follows Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) years before his younger cousin Frodo's adventures in The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo's mentor, drops by one day to take Bilbo on an adventure. More than a dozen dwarves join them in an attempt to reclaim their treasure and homeland from a greedy dragon. Jackson doesn't just follow J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit. He adds tidbits from other Tolkien books to flesh out the story.

The film's ambiance is jarring, alternately somber and colorfully childish. The latter is the more endearing, mainly because it is more original. Many shots and scenes come across as a worn imitation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Action scenes are repetitive and confusing, while other scenes drag on. Cutting a good 45 minutes might have improved the pacing.

That said, revisiting Tolkien's work is nostalgic. Its ominous tone, including a glimpse of the dark ""necromancer,"" foreshadows the increasing perils in The Lord of the Rings. The characters are charming. Bilbo is more mischievous and developed than the movie-version's saintly Frodo (Elijah Wood). (It is still nice to see Frodo again.) The dwarves, though stereotypes, including Richard Armitage's Thorin, are nicely acted and likable.

There is something enjoyable about talking monsters. Their humor SLIGHTLY humanizes them. Unfortunately, a white, giant orc is given a very cheesy role as Thorin's nemesis. The film dwells far too long on how evil this creature is. We had three movies to discover how bad orcs are. I didn't find this plotline compelling.

Perhaps the best scene of the film occurs between Bilbo and (SPOILER ALERT) Gollum (Andy Serkis). It is one of the most subtle moments in a loud, heavy-handed movie. The encounter between the former hobbit-like creature, a currently mad Gollum, and the inexperienced but crafty hobbit Bilbo is genuinely suspenseful.

The cinematography and music are lovely, but all derivative. It feels more like a copy than an ode. The Hobbit could have been a truly resonant, enchanting movie instead of a trilogy. The makers could have distinguished this film from its predecessors. But the lure of gold, as Smaug the dragon would agree, is strong enough to justify one movie for the price of three.",1387497600,,2346,5.160526315789474
4634584,4,B0059XTU1S,"Since most reviews seem to only mention the movie(which I LOVE, btw, sexy/rowdy dwarves >ALL)  I thought I'd focus on the packaging(which is why I rated it at 4/5. If I was JUST rating the non movie items, I would have rated it even lower...
The box everything is packaged in is covered with beautiful artwork of Gandalf at the Shire ,Gandalf with the Eagles & Azog's hiding under a flyer barely attached to the outside of the box. Nice enough to be displayed on it's own, but unfortunately it's quite large. Nearly half again as large as the LotR Extended Editions, so no continuity there. I may have to break it down because it's just too large to display as a whole.
The statue...admittedly I wasn't thrilled that it was going to be Bilbo & Gollum anyway(yes, I know it's The HOBBIT and not Sexy Dwarves on Parade...), but from what I'd seen online(and being a completist) I knew I'd have to have it.
Such disappoint.
The sculpt is actually quite nice, but the paint job REALLY leaves something to be desired. Very flat and truthfully, kinda sloppy. Doesn't hold a candle to the Gollum statue from LotR. I'm an obsessive repainter, but I really don't like touching things that may have some collector's value. This one, however, I just won't be able to display as/is...
It is a very sturdy piece w/ a nice plaque on the bottom; ""Riddles in the Dark"" w/ the sculptor's sig & all the copyright info. Some 'feet' to keep it off the shelf. And it was packaged very nicely so it had no damage. There is a 'gold' metal plaque on the front of the base; ""The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey"". Unfortunately mine has some weird tarnish/dark ugly marks that I've yet to remove...
Finally, I thought I'd read a few reviews that mentioned how the disc packaging matches the awesome 'book look' that the LotR Extendeds DVDs have. Maybe the Hobbit Extended DVD edition has that, but the Blu-Ray does NOT. It's very nice, but just a smaller, 'window pane' slip cover that holds the actual blu-ray case. I was looking forward to a shelf of 'Peter Jackson does Tolkien books'...
And that was it. Seems there were all kinds of extra lil things with the LotR editions(extra discs) ads for more goodies, not anything particularly important, just made it more fun to dig in. Hopefully they'll have more for Desolation of Smaug(and I'd best get a DRAGON with that extended edition...)",1387497600,,2362,4.610451306413301
4634585,5,B0059XTU1S,"I liked the original theatrical cut, but I VERY much liked the additional footage that Peter Jackson seemlessly added to the film.

I was tempted to not order this Hobbit movie due to some of the negative reviews, but am glad I did buy the extended Blu-ray version.  Some parts did seem a little odd from viewing the clips on youtube, but seeing the whole movie they fit together better than I expected.  I really enjoyed most of the movie, as it definitely brings back memories of the Lord Of The Rings movie.

The only parts I didn't like as much were that giant orc king or whatever he is, I didn't care for his dancing, it seemed a little goofy with him spinning around in a circle like a ballerina.  And the scene with Gollum, the riddle part seemed to drag on a little too long but was ok.

I know everyone has a different opinion on this, but the movie to me seemed to end quicker than I expected.  Yes I know there are two more parts coming, but I really enjoyed watching all of it.

4634629,4,B0059XTU1S,"My first memory of my father was me sitting in his lap as he read me the first page of the Hobbit. I've read the book numerous times, own the at times ironically entertaining Rankin-Bass Hobbit cartoon and loved the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings movies. I even think that, especially in the Two Towers and Return of the King, they benefit from the extended edition.

But the first movie in the Hobbit series is hurt, quite a bit, by the decision to stretch it into three movies. Was there more than would fit into one movie? Probably; the stuff with the Necromancer was pretty crucial to explain where Gandalf kept going to, and the visuals of Erebor are great for explaining the importance of the journey to the dwarves.

But the degree to which this has been stretched and padded goes beyond just including crucial information and creating three separate narrative arcs so that the movies, in theory, can each stand on their own for viewers. The movie dawdles far too long in Rivendell, there's way too much time spent in Erebor and way more time spent with Radagast (who's better in subsequent viewings than I thought originally, although he's not nearly as charming as Jackson seems to think he is). Trimming each of those back by half would make for a much more sprightly film.

I own the Lord of the Rings movies in far too many formats, but I don't foresee picking up more than just the one DVD for each of the Hobbit films. Unless the next two improve dramatically on the first, this is a slight, charming book made bloated by movie studios eager to keep the gravy train rolling as long as possible and a well-meaning director who doesn't have people telling him ""no"" firmly enough.",1387324800,,1692,4.577557755775578

Of course there are some amazing moments and it is really cool to see some of those great scenes come to life; but I couldn't get past the feeling that we were all being duped.,1387324800,4,470,4.233333333333333

4634681,2,B0059XTU1S,"If you thought Peter Jackson's vision of ""The Lord of the Rings"" was bloated and awkward at times, you'll like the first installment of his ""Hobbit"" trilogy even less. If you thought Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" was perfection, you won't like this one either. Peter Jackson and his fellow writers have str-et-ch-ed J.R.R. Tolkien's fine adventure story into three installments. The first, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, as is the next one. It's boring, exhibits poor storytelling skills, and is dominated by lots of nonsensical action scenes. Jackson & Co. have introduced a new villain into the plot in order to get more action scenes. Mostly, this results in incoherence, but there are more action scenes.

The story begins with two prologues, as an elderly Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) records in his journal a brief history of the fall of the prosperous city of Dale, populated by men, and of the dwarf kingdom of Erebor, whose fortress city was inside the Lonely Mountain, where the dwarves mined gold and gems. Both were lost to the dragon Smaug, who devastated Dale and scattered the dwarves so that he might have their treasure. In the second prologue, Bilbo and his nephew Frodo await some guests, as Bilbo recalls his youthful adventures. Now the story begins: When Bilbo (Martin Freeman) was but a conventional hobbit youth, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) arrived on his doorstep, along with 13 other uninvited guests, the kingdom-less King Thorin (Richard Armitage) of the dwarves among them, to persuade Bilbo to undertake a journey to reclaim Erebor from Smaug.

But encounters with Smaug are somewhere in the future. Rumors are swirling of a dark power in the form of a Necromancer, but we don't see him either. The villain in this installment is a white orc named Azog (Manu Bennett), who is hunting the band of adventurers, seeking revenge on Thorin. Who knew orcs were so independent-minded? I started to regret the CGI here. The wargs that Azog uses to track the dwarves seem pretty silly after a while, as you might expect of giant computer-generated canines. The orcs look too similar to goblins, which closely resemble trolls, so that's confusing. But most of this movie is filler: background information, endless scenes in which Gandalf tries to convince Bilbo to join the adventure party, more background, scenes that serve no purpose in the plot, humor that isn't funny, punctuated by action scenes.

I haven't read ""The Hobbit"" in a long time, but I don't recall there being so many dei ex machina. Gandalf always rescues everyone. Action scenes seem to begin for little reason and end for reasons just as weak. Many characters appear in ""An Expected Journey"" who were not in Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", such as the elvin Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), the hobo-like wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy). The writers have done everything they can to extend the film by creating complications and subplots, but this undermines the basic adventure story and leaves the audience confounded as to what is going on. The character of Bilbo has also been made braver and more inclined to battle, which creates a very different perspective on events than what charmed so many readers of ""The Hobbit.""

The special effects, scenes, action were all 5 stars. I also think the producers and directors did what they could with The Hobbit because the story and intensity just isn't the same as LOTRs. Some of the scenes were just too dragged out such as the dwarfs coming into Baggins house and I know from reading the book..this was the short version of that. Then the riddles with Smegal got on my nerves.  I enjoyed the movie more toward the middle to the end because it took a long time to get going.

I wasn't really hooked into the plight of the dwarfs. I think this is because the focus of the story is disconnected. The focus is on Bilbo..while the goal is with the dwarfs. Thorin wasn't all that likable and I wouldve liked to somehow found more reasons to care about what happened to him. Of course, toward the end he finally becomes more likable. However, I did enjoy how Bilbo felt he couldn't do anything right at first, but then he proved himself. That was the best part.

Considering it was filmed in Red Epic 3D from the start as opposed to post production conversion, it really shows in this movie.

4634737,3,B0059XTU1S,"I'm reviewing the extended version DVD, can't speak to BluRay.

As with the original cut, my wife and I liked the movie.  The additional scenes add a bit to the story, but I don't think they were worth buying the movie a second time (we also own the original cut).  My wife really liked the added scenes of the dwarves insulting the elves, but the added info in the beginning concerning the dwarves falling out with the elves and the few seconds of the child Bilbo meeting Gandalf did not warrant the additional cost of this set.

Aside from the producer commentary, there are less extras than the original cut.  The New Zealand: Home of Middle Earth extra is on disc one, same as the original.  The cover says another extra, ""Durin's Folk: Creating the Dwarves"" is on disc two; however, it's not there.  The only Special Feature on disc two is continuation of the producer's commentary.

So, if you have the original already, I personally do not think this ""extended"" version is worth the extra money.

4634741,5,B0059XTU1S,"First, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey itself I greatly enjoyed. It was a worthy successor to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies, despite the fact that Peter Jackson took a few more creative liberties with An Unexpected Journey (and after watching the second movie, it is clear with the entire Hobbit trilogy) than he did with The Lord of the Rings. Despite the changes, Peter Jackson still keeps the same feel from the original Lord of the Rings movies, the characters mostly fit with how you'd imagine them from reading the story (or at least they did for me), and many of the scenes have fairly clear reasons for why they were altered. In The Lord of the Rings and in The Hobbit, some of the scenes Jackson had to move along more quickly in the movies than they had moved in the book, and in The Hobbit, Jackson is trying to tie the story far more to The Lord of the Rings than the book did, which is the reason for many of the more drastic changes. However, the movie still keeps the general story line intact.

As far as the extended edition scenes, on my first viewing I thought almost all of them were fairly poorly worked in, but much like The Hobbit soundtracks, I warmed up to them after watching the extended edition two to three times.

Extended edition scene spoilers:
The extended edition scenes I liked from the beginning were many of the Rivendell scenes, especially with Bilbo and Elrond, which connect The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey to Bilbo's eventual moving to Rivendell in The Fellowship of the Ring. I also enjoyed the scene near the beginning with Bilbo buying food in Hobbiton, and briefly worried that a blue hat-like figure was Gandalf (it was actually another hobbit carrying some sort of laundry basket or something). I also did enjoy the Rivendell scene where Bofur sings a version of the 'Man in the Moon' song Frodo sang in Bree in The Fellowship of the Ring book, and though I still feel the extra dwarf scenes around there weren't worked in the best, I now feel they were worked in better than I had when I first watched the extended edition. Probably the scenes that changed the most in how much I liked them were the extra content in the intro. I initially felt that they were worked in awkwardly and made an already long intro drag even more, but after watching the intro a few more times I felt that they were actually worthwhile additions, especially since they weren't very long, and were actually worked in fairly well.

There are two extended edition scenes, however, that I still feel are a bit of a disappointment. The first is right before entering Rivendell, Bilbo turns to Gandalf and tells him he can feel something, and Gandalf tells him fairly mysteriously and actually somewhat creepily that what he feels is a very powerful magic. This scene seemed somewhat awkward and I understand why they cut it for the theatrical edition. My least favorite added scene was the goblin-town scene. I enjoyed the music and am glad I saw the part, but unlike many of the other extended scenes where it was clear they had actually tapped the longer scenes and then cut them down for the theatrical edition, the goblin-town scene with the goblin-king seems like they had an ALTERNATIVE scene they had made and tried to put them both together. It would have worked far better put in some sort of bonus or alternative scene area on the disc instead of into the movie, but I'm pretty sure Peter Jackson and his group will never use the alternative scene idea and will stick with extended editions since they seem to like extended editions so much.

SECOND MOVIE SPOILER:
After watching The Desolation of Smaug (which was a great sequel), I also noticed that at least one of the extended scenes (and I thought I had thought of two scenes earlier, but only one is coming to me at the moment) hinted at events to happen in the second movie. The scene I am referring to is the scene with the dwarves in Rivendell where Kili jokes about how he doesn't find elf-maidens very attractive because he prefers his women with lots of facial hair, but there was one specific ""elf-maiden"" he joked he thought was attractive at the dinner. Another dwarf (I think it was Oin) said that the elf was actually an elf-(dude? man? guy? not sure what the male version of ""maiden"" in elf-maiden would be) and all the other dwarves laugh. This scene, at least to me, seems to hint at the semi-romance between Kili and Tauriel in the second movie.

CONCLUSION:
In my opinion the extended version of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is well worth getting over the theatrical version. The theatrical version was around 2.5 hours, and the extended edition only adds 12 minutes to that, so it would be pretty hard to screw up the entire movie with them. Also, most of the extra scenes were well worth adding, and even the not-so-great additions like the goblin-king extra scenes were still very interesting to watch despite them not fitting the best into the movie. So I would highly recommend getting The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and would highly recommend the version you get be the extended edition.

But the real, happy surprise were the bonus features. There is actually a 9 hour, second movie spread across 3 discs on the ""making of"". I just keep the DVD in my player, and nibble the 15-20 segments at a time; kind of like watching a TV series on disk.
 It's not a ""fluff piece"", but actually a well-done documentary (in chronological order) that is a joy for anyone who likes understanding (or wants to learn about) the challenges, skills, frustrations, and above all artistry and teamwork that go into creating film of this complexity.

Most of the actors are great as in the LOTR (except for some of the dwarfs, but perhaps it's the goofy costumes), but I still grieve for them. They should have got off the train at the end of the LOTR trilogy.

  This is the very first story that takes place before The Lord of The Rings movie trilogy by Peter Jackson.

In this movie series, we first met the older Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) before Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam began their journey in The Lord of The Rings.

  But on this day, Bilbo decides it is time to write his story, to his nephew Frodo, of his adventure in discovering and obtaining the powerful Ring first. Their is more to the story he has never told, such as, the discovery of the Arkenstone and the first attack of the dragon from the north. The dragon's name is Smaug. He attacked the town of Dale and scared away the Dwarves out of their place to live on Lonely Mountain.
  Bilbo (Martin Freeman) lives in the Shire. He is 50, but looks younger. He has a nice house in the hill where the home inside feels warm and round archways compliment the entrance to a room. Bilbo meets the wizard, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) who secretly etches a glowing symbol on Bilbo's front door. Later that night, a dwarve visits his door. It is Dwalin (Graham McTavish). Bilbo wasn't interested in accepting any company tonight, but Dwalin makes himself at home and wants to eat food. He eats almost whatever food he sees Bilbo has. Bilbo tries to hide some bread for himself. Then a second visitor arrives. It is Dwalin's brother, Balin (Ken Stott).
 Soon Bilbo's house is filled with 12 dwarves including, Fili (Dean O'Gorman), Kili (Aidan Turner), Dori (Mark Hadlow), Nori (Jed Brophy), Ori (Adam Brown), Oin (John Callen), Gloin (Peter Hambleton), Bifur (William Kircher), Bofur (James Nesbitt) and Bombur (Stephen Hunter).
  Bilbo has had enough of this. They all eat a feast and eat everything Bilbo has. The cherished family dishes are being thrown and played with. The place is a mess. But since the arrival of Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Bilbo knows he has been tricked.  Gandalf knows Bilbo is the chosen one and they ask him to sign a contract to help them on their mission to reclaim Lonely Mountain. Bilbo wants no part of it. He wants to stay in Bag End.
 When Bilbo awakens and finds his house is back to being clean and his dishes are clean and back in their proper place, he changes his mind and catches up with the company to be part of the quest. Gandalf had no doubt, or did he? It won't be easy for our new friends.

Also in the cast: Elijah Wood, Sylvester McCoy, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, Andy Serkis, Lee Pace, Benedict Cumberbatch.

Option of Language & Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.

Special Feature: New Zealand's Home of Middle-Earth.

With Gandalf telling the story of Bilbo Baggin's great-great-great-great uncle, Bullroarer Took and the Battle of Green Fields venging the Goblin King, I wonder if Peter Jackson will make a new trilogy of this in the near future? Surely, there are more stories to tell.

The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are based upon the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien  (John Ronald Revel Tolkien, 1882-1973).

I love it, but it could have been better in my opinion.  My chief complaint is with the orcs.  This movie CGI'd the bad guys as opposed to having actors dress up in truly terrifying costumes that just looked mean.  The orcs in the Lord of the Rings trilogy were much better done.  I also had minor complaints with the scenery, for at times it looked like in their attempt to bring out the 'natural' tones of the landscapes they made them look almost artificial.

The Hobbit is just a short story when compared with LOTR, and it would appear that he served the main course first, before the appetizers.  Now, he has taken this relatively short story and stretched it into three feature length movies.  The packaging on this movie was also a bit lackluster when compared to the packaging for the Extended Versions of LOTR.  The movie itself was well done, although I really don't think we needed the whole ""White Orc"" embellishment.

4634864,5,B0059XTU1S,"When I first learned a few years ago that they were making a Hobbit film I was ecstatic. The Fellowship of the Ring was released in 2001 and I literally grew up with the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy. However, I then learned that Peter Jackson decided to split the book up into three movies. My first thought was greedy Hollywood scoundrels but nonetheless I was still excited to see the films. After my initial viewing of An Unexpected Journey in theaters last December and my recent viewing of the extended edition, I see why there are three movies and I am 100% behind the decision. Peter Jackson has used The Hobbit films to not only tell the story of the popular novel, but also to expand upon and provide an in-depth build-up to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. As with the previous extended editions of the original trilogy; The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Extended Edition adds more plot details and provides a healthy amount of fan service.

 First of all, the extended edition features excellent editing. You have to really be watching for the additional and extended scenes as they are perfectly edited into the film. There is no visual quality drop and the score is beautifully composed to make the work feel whole. The film looks amazing with great use of CGI, makeup, and costumes. I know many people were disappointed with the increased CGI when compared to the LOTR trilogy, but it does not take away from the experience for me.

 The film itself is an impressive feat; however, unlike the original trilogy extended editions, this extended edition doesnt make the film better. It does not make the film worse, it just does not add anything as monumental as The Mouth of Sauron was in The Return of the King extended edition. A little over half of the 13 additional minutes are of the dwarves and goblins singing and doing other silly acts for comic relief. This adds a lighter feel to the film that makes it feel more like the novel and less like The Lord of the Rings.

 As for the film itself, it is phenomenal. The film stands up to the LOTR trilogy and is a worthy addition to the franchise. Casting was done brilliantly, with Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Richard Armitage as Thorin stealing the show. The action, while not as real as in the LOTR trilogy due to increased CGI, was exciting and plentiful. Howard Shore also continues his fine work in the franchise composing a wonderful score blending in new sounds along with bringing back some of the familiar themes from the original trilogy. The original source material from the novel is done justice along with added material present to help set up the LOTR trilogy. All of this combines into a satisfying package that makes me excited to see the remaining two chapters.

While I cannot say that this extended edition is the absolute best version of the film, it is not any worse than the others. This version adds onto an already fantastic work, and hardcore fans of the franchise would do themselves justice watching this version of the film.

Score: 9/10

Note: This Blu-ray also comes with two additional discs featuring Hours of behind the scenes content that I personally have not viewed yet. As most people will be purchasing this product for the actual film I did not deem it necessary to include the extra content in my review.",1386633600,,3313,4.64957264957265

4634871,4,B0059XTU1S,"Although a bit slow in places, the film definitely has the feel of a 'table-setter' I really didn't mind that so much. You can see Jackson deftly laying out the premise and introducing key characters in a way which will make the following films all the more enjoyable. He did it with LOTR, and I fully expect him to do it again here. Almost as enjoyable as the film are the extras. I especially enjoyed the Blogs and off-line insights. I love the behind the scenes tidbits as a reminder of just how much work goes into a Jackson epic. Mind you, this is definitely a popcorn movie; more fun than substance, but that said, it's a grand ride.",1386547200,,639,4.378151260504202

4634897,5,B0059XTU1S,"This movie is great. I had seen the original when it came out of DVD, and even then it was after it had been released for a while. I saw this extended edition was coming out so I decided to pre-order it. The movie looks incredible on blue-ray. There is so much beautiful scenery that really comes out in high definition. The extendedness of this movie does not in any way hinder the experience. Every single thing that was cut out for the original theatrical version feels like it belongs in this movie. They just fit so perfectly to make The Hobbit and even better film. Also at no point does the movie seem too long. At the end I am still upset that it is over and want to watch more. I kept seeing things where I was like, ""I don't remember that. I wonder if that is new"". Then looking through the scene selections it tells you which scenes have extra parts. I haven't had a chance to watch any of the special features yet but looking at the large list I am looking forward to.

I Ioved Jackson's adaption of LOTR to film.  I greatly enjoyed this film. However, I suppose that the job of turning one rather short book; which was originally intended for younger readers, into 3 feature length films: is significantly more difficult than doing the same with a magnum opus like LOTR.  For those who enjoy good fanasty this is heady stuff.",1386460800,,523,4.484210526315789

4634903,5,B0059XTU1S,"While the Extended Edition of the Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey is only 13 minutes longer than the Theatrical Version (not like the additional ~40 minutes of extra material for the LOTR Extended Editions) and the pacing is a bit slower, I enjoyed the inclusion of the Goblin King's song because the songs are so important in the book.  Could have skipped seeing the dwarves frollicing naked in the fountain in Rivendale.

I'm not sure this version of the film is better than the theatrical version, but the 9+ hours of documentaries and the commentary are excellent -- watching Ian McKellen struggle with the isolation of filming the Bag End scenes on a green screen set apart from the other actors,  the design process to come up with distinctive looks for all the dwarfs, and the watching the actors suffer spinning on a spit were the highlights for me.

The commentary offers insight as to why the filmmakers made many of the changes to the story, the limitations and restrictions based on not owning the rights to all of Tolkien's works, etc...",1386460800,,1049,4.773480662983426

4634915,4,B0059XTU1S,"Not the very best of the Tolkien/Jackson series or franchise, but much better than the ""theatrical release,"" the Extended version actually makes more sense! There are some bizarre plot holes (you got to read the Mad magazine's take on this, priceless), but it is a visual delight nonetheless. Also, I am usually not a fan of all those ""extras"" and ""featurettes"" and whatnots, but I must admit I was mesmerized by some of the techniques they used, the dedication and all.

While there were some differences in the movie from the book (like it is with many other book to movie adaptions), it was still an exciting movie to watch. It had action, it had drama, it had moments that made me tear up and laugh immediately right after. The extended scenes were fun to watch, and they added a little extra fun to the film.",1386460800,,422,4.222222222222222

4634918,5,B0059XTU1S,"Personally, I love 'em! I've been a Tolkien fan since childhood and I'm really glad that someone was able to make these great stories into great movies. Yes, they don't follow the books exactly, but the ""fill"" is Tolkien's writings or at the very least, in the spirit of his work. These movies (LOTR & The Hobbit) are very well made, entertaining, fun and exciting and are great for kids of all ages! I really love the extended editions.

The Hobbit movies are turning out to be another movie making triumph! Many people complain about this or that, well that's okay, but I'll just select the version that suits me (extended blu-ray) and enjoy a few hours of wonderful entertainment. Thank you Peter Jackson and Company for making delightful movies of long loved stories.",1386460800,,771,4.753731343283582
4634919,5,B0059XTU1S,"As expected, Peter Jackson does a marvelous job!  Having not seen the theatrical release, I wonder at the bits added to this version.  The only things that stuck in my teeth, as it were, was the Goblin King singing as if this was a warped musical -- true, the goblins en masse were singing as per the book, but not with rock 'n' roll accompaniment.  This reader pictured it more of a thumbed nose-style of singing like ""Naah naah naah naah naah!  We caught you, dwarves!""  Also, the Goblin King seemed extremely erudite and well-spoken -- again, I pictured more of a brute, like a mobster of sorts, but, alas, Peter didn't call me to ask my opinion.  The trolls were absolutely hysterical, but a bit over the top -- can't picture a troll reaching for a handkerchief in his pocket or using the epithet ""cakehole"" -- but the scene was funny.  My only other criticism would be Bombur -- his fat make-up/costume seemed a bit overdone when he would sit and he came across as too slobbish for my tastes.  Other than these three complaints, the rest of the film is magnificent and will be unparalleled anytime in the near future except by Peter, himself.  I especially appreciate how he has already woven history from the appendices into the storyline.  All in all, a delightful experience I will watch over and over, though the Fellowship film has my highest marks.  Can't wait to see what he does for the next two films!",1386460800,,1415,4.553359683794467

4634944,5,B0059XTU1S,Welcome back to middle earth!  The extended Edition of the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey doesn't have the enormous amount of extra movie time that the LOTR trilogy had but it is still plenty to satisfy.  The movie is great and looks amazing on Blu ray.  The special features on this are amazing.  More than 9 hours of features take you through every aspect of the film from beginning to end.  Watching the features really takes you into the movie and what it takes to create such and amazing world.  The features alone and worth getting this Blu ray.  If anyone purchased the LOTR extended editions with the statues will love the Bilbo and Gollum figure that comes with this.  The piece is great!

4634951,3,B0059XTU1S,"If you consider it as one film, the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (extended versions), is my favorite film.  When the ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" came out, I was as excited as the kid I was when ""The Empire Strikes Back"" came out.  However, I left the theater depressed and disappointed.  Yes, it has some great scenes, but it also have some terrible parts that deeply hurt the film.  Most fans like myself found themselves believing every second of ""The Lord of the Rings"", but there were several scenes in ""The Hobbit"" where I was groaning or screaming ""Bulls***!""  I was fine until the scene with the three trolls.  Once the dwarves entered Goblintown, the stupidity just starts piling up like manure in a barn.  Surfing on a broken bridge down a bottomless cliff? Please!

The extended version is better than the theatrical version and adds more depth to the story.  Seen on Blu-ray, the detail of the sets and costumes and digital effects are incredible.  If you can suffer through the stupid scenes, it's worth it.  The second movie looks to be a lot better!",1386374400,2,1070,4.668449197860962

I probably didn't <i>need</i> the 3D version.  My 42"" screen is good, but home 3D always lets me down.  I'd take away half a star if I could.  Why, you ask?

4634965,5,B0059XTU1S,More than enough has been said on here and on countless other sites about this film and all of the LOTR films so I won't bore you with details. But I will say this: if you are a fan of The Hobbit then the EXTENDED version of the film is the version of the film you MUST buy. Do the scant 13mins or so of footage add that much to the storyline? Nah. Not really. But do the extras on this set more than make up for whatever the film might be lacking in someone's opinion? Absolutely. The producers on this Blu ray set do an INCREDIBLE job of presenting the viewer with amazingly well done documentaries that cover every aspect on the making of this film. It's almost mind-numbingly exhausting to go through all of the features but I have done so and I am here to tell you: BUY THIS SET! The docs alone are worth the price of admission. Video and audio are top notch on both the 2D and 3D versions. I've seen this movie 4 times since I've purchased the Blu ray and I must say that it's replay value is very high. Great film. Even better Blu ray set.,1386374400,,1046,4.107317073170732

I was initialy disappointed with the ending but realized he couldn't do the Dragon to his satisfaction so he had to come up with a different end to the story. which was done well. The story he did give us was fantastic a blast to watch. And the beauty of the world he created is wonderful. As are the characters he creates.
  Update : I wrote the prior review not knowing about the next two parts. Which are as equally thrilling and entertaining as The Unexpected Journey was to watch. The next two parts are The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of The Five Armies. The detail Peter Jackson puts into all of his productions is of coarse always unequaled in the film industry.

4635029,5,B0059XTU1S,"The reviews for the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit movies are very confusing. This review is for the Extended Edition 3-disc Blu-ray of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. (The DVD version is 5 discs. If in doubt, check the minutes shown in the details of the page.)

I did a review of the extended edition Fellowship of the Rings. It was fantastic and well worth the money as were the extended editions of the other two movies.

The extended edition for The Hobbit is not as fantastic. There are a couple scenes that really make you think, ""Ohhhh! Now I get it!"" but that's about it. In spite of the minimal changes, it is still worth the money in my opinion. The additional material is also good - not as good as the Lord of the Rings extended editions but still.

I have never read the books and he read them but a long time ago so we can not speak to any differences between the books and the movie.

If you are choosing between buying the extended edition and the original, definitely buy the extended edition.

If you are not a big fan and you already own the original version, you might not want to bother.

If you are a fan, even if you own the original version, you will probably appreciate the extended edition - it's a borderline call.

The packaging is a little different than the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings but it was designed to be part of that set and that shows. I don't care about that really but I understand collectors do.

Until now, we have not purchased Blu-rays but we happened to need another dvd player and the prices for the Blu-rays have dropped so much we decided to go ahead with the Blu-ray player. We had seen the Blu-ray movies in stores displayed next to the DVD version of the movies and the difference was amazing. Still, with neither of us being fanatical about picture quality and sound beyond the ""quite good"" point, it is still more expensive to buy the Blu-ray discs (although they are dropping in price). We came to the conclusion that it would be worth it to buy Blu-rays of movies that were particularly graphic intensive such as the Hobbit but for run of the mill movies we would stick with the cheaper dvds.

We were disappointed with the Hobbit on Blu-ray. We had watched the Hobbit before on pay-per-view and we could not see any real difference between the HD and the Blu-ray. In this case, the Blu-ray was actually a dollar or so cheaper so no big deal but don't expect to be stunned by the Blu-ray.

This came with a code for a free Ultraviolet copy. If you don't know what this is please do your research. Since we did not go out and buy brand new latest and greatest equipment just to watch this movie, the free Ultraviolet copy was useless. It would not play on anything except our new Blu-ray player and why would we need it for that? We have the Blu-ray disc. Personally, I see the Ultraviolet copy as utterly useless and NOT a selling point for anything at all.",1386201600,2,2930,4.38929889298893

4635031,5,B0059XTU1S,"Awesome movie.  The extra footage flows seemlessly and adds just a bit to the film that I think makes it better.  The differences are not as noticable as the extra footage in The Lord of the Rings trilogy was, but you can pick it out if you're familiar with the movie.  The special features are wonderful, and the commentaries are fun and really interesting.  If you are a fan of The Hobbit then this is the movie for you.",1386201600,,422,4.30379746835443

This movie really shouldn't be titled the hobbit, as much as ""peter jackson's: the lord of the rings prequel.""  I say that because Jackson has added and subtracted so much that it can't be called ""the Hobbit"". I was really disappointed.

4635061,3,B0059XTU1S,"in my opinion, the special effects  and sets are overdone at the expense of the characters and plot.  One of the editors of LOTR said that sometimes, less is better.  That applies to this movie.
The Bilbo in this movie is boring with very little personality.  Ian Holm has set a high standard for this role.  Martin Freeman is just not Bilbo, even a young Bilbo.
Have you seen a miniature horse?  Do you know why a miniature horse is not a pony?  It's because a miniature horse has the same proportions as a horse, not a pony.  Why is this important?  The dwarfs in The Hobbit are miniature men.  Gimli was a dwarf.  These dwarfs are dwarfs in name only.  This tactic probably lowered the cost of making this movie but at the cost of looking authentic.
If this was a stand alone movie, I probably would have given it a higher rating.  But it follows the masterpiece of LOTR and doesn't approach the quality of that trilogy.  LOTR (all three films)  is about as perfect a movie that can be made.
So enjoy The Hobbit for what it is, not for what it should and could have been.  I hope the sequels are not as extravagant and overdone as in this film.  I would much rather have seen Peter Jackson focus on the characters and plot instead of  having them compete with the special effects.",1386028800,,1283,4.341772151898734

I fell asleep in the middle.  ""The Hobbit"" was, I believe, originally meant to be a book for young people, and this movie, with its gratuitous violence, is anything but.

To be fair, the extended scenes on LOTR were a bit more memorable. It's true that the extra scenes in the Hobbit contribute to tell a much more coherent story, but I completely understand why they were cut from the theatrical release.

The other two discs have a lot of extra material if you are a hardcore fan.

Certainly worth your money if you really love the franchise!

Just a complaint: I HATE REGION LOCKING!
One of the extra features that pushed me to buy this movie was that it came with an UltraViolet code to watch it via internet on practically any devise. The problem is that I live in Costa Rica (Latin America) so I can't use the code I paid for in my country because of regional restrictions.

4635132,5,B0059XTU1S,"The extended edition is very much in the same vein of how the Lord of The Rings extended edition blu rays were done. The big difference being the movie is only on one disc instead of being spread between two discs. I am not sure what the theatrical edition of the movie had for a run time, but the extended edition clocks in at just over 3hrs (10 min or so of which are credits).

Like Lord of the Rings, they are splitting the book up into 3 movies. This tells the story up to the orc battle in the woods before the group gets back to the Dwarven city, where of course the dragon awaits. The beginning of the movie starts out somewhat slowly, but does bring back Elijah Wood and Ian Holm to reprise their roles in sort of a lead up to Frodo meeting Gandalf in Fellowship. Then the movie flashes back to the events of The Hobbit, with Martin Freeman doing a wonderful job in the role of Bilbo.

While the main story revolves around Bilbo and the Dwarves, we do get to see some of the characters from the LOTR films throughout the movie. The three main sequences in the film for me were the escape from the Goblins, the battle with the Orcs toward the very end of the film, and Bilbo's encounter with Gollum where of course the Ring is found. There is, of course much more than that in the movie, but those were the standout moments to me.

The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray. If you do get the extended edition, like with the LOTR discs, there are two appendices discs which have about 9 hrs of bonus material spread pretty evenly between them. The one drawback to those is that the discs are not set up to allow you to stop and pick up where you left off. So you either have to watch all 4 plus hours of material straight through, or watch each section one-by-one. It is a relatively minor issue, but could be a pain for those who do like to go through the bonus material

Basically, .like the LOTR extended editions, this is pretty much for hardcore fans. If you are lukewarm to the movie or just kind of a casual fan there is not really a big reason to shell out the extra money for these. But if you want to get the most movie and bonus material available then you will get more than enough here to keep you happy.",1385337600,,2227,4.1841491841491845

4635156,4,B0059XTU1S,"This is really a 3 star movie, and I find it even harder to sit through than the theatrical version. The biggest problem /i had with the theatrical version was the pacing, which made the movie go at a snails pace, however the new cut doesn't seem to be a director's cut, and the pacing problems stay the same. There is also a very dumb song in the middle with the goblin king that makes him more nonthreatening than he already was. I hope that the second part of the trilogy is not as bad as this.

As far as the supplementary material, this is a must have for aspiring filmmakers. The docs were interesting and informative, but they appeal more to geeks and people who need to know everything there is about this production. Overall, I do not recommend the movie, but I do recommend this set, because the supplementary materials make up for everything.",1385337600,,853,4.467948717948718

A must-have for any fan of Tolkien, Jackson, or these amazing movies. Am hoping that with ""The Hobbit: There and Back Again"" scheduled for a Summer 2014 release, that the next extended release will come this spring, rather than next November.

One point I will make is that the format of the supplemental materials in these extended releases are different than was that case with LotR. There is only the one commentary track (instead of four). There is no included map to the discs (arguably unnecessary). The supplemental materials themselves are more cohesive than I what I recall from LotR (single ""Play All"" functions capture everything). I'm also slightly disappointed that the disc cases are of an inconsistent design compared with the Blu-Ray extended releases of LotR. But perhaps that's also intentional... at one moment during the director's commentary, there is a portion where a drop-in was clearly added mentioning a future 6-movie Hobbit+LotR release, which would include yet additional content not released as part of the separate extended releases of the individual films. So... we shall see what the future holds!",1384819200,,1283,5.258536585365854
4635203,5,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson's extended editions are always worth the wait, and ""The Hobbit: Extended Edition"" is no exception.  In addition to adding back scenes that were cut for the theatrical release (which other reviewers have mentioned), there are an amazing 3 discs of bonus coverage totaling almost 9 hours.

Just as J.R.R. Tolkien had appendices to his books, Jackson's movies have appendices. These extraordinary ""making of"" features for ""The Hobbit"" carry on the numbering from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The extended edition release for ""Return of the King"" ended with Appendices Part 6.  So ""The Hobbit"" begins with Appendices Part 7.

These are extraordinarily detailed glimpses into the creation of this movie from the very beginning to the very end. Long before any actors were notified, they worked on production design and concepts. Character designs and concepts. Scripts were changed right up to the day of shooting. Motion-capture was brought to new levels. Costuming and the decisions that went into it are fascinating!

You see clips from rehearsals and clips from rushes. Clips from meetings and makeup and why this was done instead of that. Very often, they start with quotes from Tolkien, how he described something/someone, and how Jackson (writer/director/coproducer) could work off of that. Commentators include every actor and I think just about everybody on the crew, too, from the concept creature sculptor to the animation technician desperately trying to finish Azog almost right up to the day of the New Zealand World Premiere!  You will not be bored by watching these many hours of extra features.

All features can be listened to in English. Subtitles are available in English, Francais, Espaol, Portuguse and four more languages.

BONUS DISC 1 The Appendices Part 7:
A.  Introduction by Peter Jackson (2 minutes)
B.  A Long Expected Journey - The Chronicles of The Hobbit - Part 1 (total 87 minutes)
You can watch the six parts individually or ""play all"".
1........Opening
2........The Journey Back to Middle Earth
3........Riddles in the Dark - Gollum's Cave
4........Roast Mutton - Trollshaw's Forest
5........Bastion of the Greenwood - Rhosgobel
6........A Short Rest - Rivendell & London
Dan Hennah (production designer) on his team's 1st look at the plans: ""We were going to be building over 100 sets in 4 studios. I can't say we actually paniced...!""
It's fabulous watching the rehearsals of Frodo and Gollum in the cave, with Andy Serkis in his motion capture suit and doing THAT voice!
Ian McKellen (plays Gandalf) remembers that when filming The Ring Trilogy 10 years earlier, he was made to look 25% larger ""by putting me, the larger character, closer to the camera.""  But as The Hobbit is shot in 3D, that system doesn't work.
Alex Funke (motion control supervisor) describes how it was done for The Hobbit: ""The only way we can make a person bigger is to put the camera closer to him. So, effectively,[in the dinner scene in Frodo's home]  we have a camera that looks at the dwarves and Bilbo in a set built to their scale. And a camera that looks at Gandalf, on a green screen, which is 25% closer to him"" on a smaller scale kitchen set. Except it isn't really a set, because everything is draped in green fabric. The two cameras are synchronized, but McKellen could not hear anything on the other set. This was very disconcerting at first, and when you look at the conditions, it's amazing it works. It's touching as McKellen describes how he was so upset after the 1st day of shooting in the green-room Bag End, that he considered he'd have to leave the movie!

C.  The Songs of The Hobbit (36 minutes)
One of the most fun songs in the movie is ""Down Down to Goblin Town"", sung by Barry Humphries as the Great Goblin. The always humorous Humphries (better known as Dame Edna!) says, ""It's entirely about destruction, death and torture. But, I tried to do it in a sympathetic way!""

BONUS DISC 2 continuation of The Appendices Part 7
A.  A Long Expected Journey - The Chronicles of The Hobbit Part 1 (total 2 hrs, 21 minutes)
You can watch the nine parts individually or ""play all""
7........Over Hill  -  The Misty Mountains
8........Under Hill  -  Goblin Town
9........Out of the Frying Pan - The Forest Ledge
10......Return to Hobbiton  -  The Shire
11......The Epic of Scene 88 -  Strath Taieri
12......The Battle of Moria  -  Azanulbizar
13......Edge of the Wilderland  -  Pick-Up and The Carrock
14......Home is Behind, The World Ahead
15......Credits
Tim Wong (assistant stunt coordinator) talks about the stunt which sends Bilbo and the dwarves tumbling down into Goblin Town: ""The trap door stunt, which leads to the Goblin caves, was probably the most intricate and dangerous stunt that I've ever been part of.""
Peter Jackson does a cameo in all his films.  This time he is a refugee dwarf in a long dark beard. Did you see him passing Thorin at a run?
Last, but not least, you are given a lovely preview of the 2nd movie, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", including a sneak peek of Benedict Cumberbatch in his facial motion capture get-up, breathing fire (figuratively).
B.  Realms of the Third Age: From Bag End to Goblin Town (total 1 hour)
You can watch the five parts individually or ""play all""
1.......Hobbiton
2.......Rhosgobel (Radagast's home)
3.......Rivendell
4.......The Misty Mountains
5.......Goblin Town
This feature focuses on the sets and locations.
Peter Jackson says at the beginning, ""It was important visually, with 'The Hobbit', that it feels like a slightly more idyllic time. I mean, the darkness that descends on this world in Lord of the Rings is brewing, but it hasn't yet expanded to the levels it's going to.""
For the Ring trilogy, most of Hobbiton was made of styrofoam and torn down afterwards. And still tourists made pilgrimages. This time around, they built the Hobbit holes and structures as in real life. They are made to last. Now you really can visit a Bag End.

BONUS DISC 3  The Appendices Part 8
Return to Middle Earth
You can watch the four parts individually or ""play all""
A.  The Company of Thorin  (1 hour 10 minutes)
Tolkien's books don't give a lot of definition for many of the dwarf personalities. For a movie, though, each of the dwarves in the party has to have his own characteristics, which drives his costume and weapons. So it was left to Jackson & Team, as well as the actors to fill everything in.  Adam Brown (plays Ori) says: ""This is my first movie. I thought I'd aim high!""
B.  Mr. Baggins - The 14th Member (16 minutes)
Ian Mckellen, the old pro, says of Martin Freeman: ""His most remarkable quality as an actor is to be able, with absolute clarity, to convey that he's thinking two things at the same time.""
C.  Durin's Folk: Creating the Dwarves (7 minutes)
Richard Armitage (plays Thorin) went through many mutations on his costuming: ""Tolkien described Thorin as having a full beard that he tucked into his belt. We have had to depart from that. I know this is controversial, because the King of the the Long Beards, people felt he should have a long beard.""
Graham McTavish (plays the bulkier, even for a dwarf, Dwalin): ""I just thought that Dwalin would have names for his axes. Because he's that kind of guy. I remembered that Emily Brnte had two dogs called Grasper and Keeper.... What an extraordinary pair of names."" And they became the names of his axes.
D.  The Peoples and Denizens of Middle Earth (total 2 hours)
You can watch the four parts individually or ""play all""
1........The Stone Trolls
2........Radagast the Brown
3........Goblins
4........Azog the Defiler
Sylvester McCoy plays the wizard Radagast, who's practically turned into a forest creature himself. McCoy didn't learn he had to say a spell in formal Elvish until he got on set. McCoy says, ""They tell me when I first arrive, and I misheard, and I thought it was Elvis."" And he goes into an Elvis impersonation. He is better at the ElviSH.
In the book, Azog apparently dies of his injury at Thorin's hand, in the Battle for Moria. With a little artistic license, they brought him back for 'The Hobbit', lusting for Thorin's head. Manu Bennet, the actor who's motion capture was used for Azog, talks about his character: ""The necessary thing that Peter wanted from Azog was what we Maori call mana, the size of the guy, the spiritual strength of the character.""

4635224,4,B0059XTU1S,"The ""extended edition"" of the hobbit: an unexpected journey comes in a sleek package that won't disappoint. The image you see on amazon is the cover however the blu ray + ultra violet banner on top is only a cardboard piece that can easily be removed. As for the film itself, it has its ups and downs. The theatrical release deserves a solid 8/10 alone, this version contains an extra 12 minutes of footage (compared to the LOTR 30-60 minute additions) some of which is just as great as the rest of the movie and adds more depth to the scene while a few others had their reasons for not making the original cut.

Positive additions
I specifically liked MOST of the scenes added in Rivindale. This is where a good portion of the footage has been added. Most of it serves to just show the clashing cultures of the dwarves and elves. Bilbo is also seen walking around the city more and we catch glimpses of a few familiar items. Gandalf and Elrond are also shown discussing the quest in more detail which adds to the story. Various small scenes throughout the film are fine and don't necessarily detract or add to the film overall.

Negative additions
In my opinion the goblin king's song is just stupid. The two songs sung by the dwarves in the original cut flow well and actually make sense (the dishes clean up songs shows the merry attitudes of the dwarves and further pronounces Bilbo's annoyance and the song of the misty mountain sets the tone for their adventure) but this part feels like more of a flash mob than anything else. HOWEVER, some may like this addition because i believe the song is in the book. The dwarves are also shown naked at a distance in Rivendale which is stupid and unnecessary but may yield a laugh for some.

I have yet to go through all of the behind the scenes material but so far I believe it deserves a 10/10 as all the LOTR extended behind the scenes disks did.

Overall I would buy this version of the film over the original just because Im a huge Middle Earth fan boy but if you are the casual movie goer who liked this film it shouldn't make much of a difference whether you purchase this version or the original cut.",1384732800,3,2155,4.420654911838791

4635228,1,B0059XTU1S,"When will Hollywood recognize the fact that not every single person in America can afford to live at Best Buy or wherever you buy your electronics?
The movie is in Blue Ray, Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet means crap to me. Who the hell cares? IF you desire to open an account and upload your Ultraviolet movies codes into it, you are now ""allowed"" to watch your version of the DVD's on any of your electronic devices. Laptops, Notebooks, phones, etc. But don't be fooled folks, UV is nothing more than a digital right authentication platform.
Unless you have a HD television with a Blue Ray player, you are NOT going to be able to watch these discs.
There is a DVD version that allows you to watch the extended version, however, if, like me, you live for the extras, 9 hours of special features and featurettes will not be available to you. That is for the Hoi Oligoi, not us Helots.
I have TV, it works. I do not have cable for the TV, only for the internet. We do not watch what passes for ""entertainment"" on American Television. We read, watch DVD's of movies with interest or documentaries.
I loved the LOTR series of movies as I had all of the books from JRR Tolkein. I do not think that the Oxford Don would approve of this singling out of people just so WB can get a little more money.
I was prepared to buy 4 copies of The Hobbit extended version with the 9 hours of extras. But I stopped when I saw they were not for regular TV.
Those who were going to get these DVD's as gifts all have TV's such as mine.
I do not feel that I should have to buy not only a new tv but a new player as well just to watch extras. Sooner or later, they all will be on You-Tube, the same as ST: Into Darkness has been and I can watch them there.
My final word is this: The screen version of the movie was AWESOME and I am sure the additional footage will make it even more so. However, studios think that the hoi polloi all have state of the art electronics and those of us who do not aren't worthy of their bother. It is a real shame.",1384646400,4,2017,4.174358974358975

But anything to make money and especially making it a three parter! I think The Hobbit would be well received by critics if it wasn't a three parter!

It should've been in one  barrel and be called The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and the Desolation of Smaug!

4635231,3,B0059XTU1S,"Going into The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I knew that it was a tale originally written for children, but the Lord of The Rings trilogy was so well done, that I fully expected the first Hobbit movie to be just as masterful. It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird s***. I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation.",1384646400,4,1988,4.275862068965517

The extra bits range from incredibly important plot enhancers to just fun additions. I was a little hesitant at first because I honestly thought it was a bit too long in theaters.

MINOR SPOILERS: There was one extended bit that was embarrassing to watch, kind of like how Phantom Menace is awesome, but the Jar-Jar parts are embarrassing to watch, especially if someone comes in on that part, and you basically have to defend yourself for liking some serious cheese. I digress, the troll king guy sings... and while being very Tolkieny, it is... uncomfortable to watch... kind of like if your grandma put her hand way too high on your leg and just left it there for far too long. Also, as far as extended content goes, there is more violence, notably a few more decapitations and the ""fleeting nudity"" mentioned on the back of the box (It's there, look at the back cover, you'll see it) was just the dwarves playing in a fountain from a distance.

4635269,5,B0059XTU1S,"Like the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, this edition adds back in footage which was deleted primarily to make the theatrical film shorter. But whereas each of the LOTR extended versions were 40 minutes to an hour longer than their theatrical counterparts, the extended edition lengthens The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey by only about 15 minutes. Ill speculate this is because the relatively late decision to make the Hobbit into three rather than two movies meant there was less leftover material.

I don't like that there apparently isn't a version which has both the Blue Ray and DVD extended editions together and so you have to choose one or the other. I also don't like that unlike the LOTR extended editions, this set doesnt include a chart telling you which scenes were added or extended.

The only documentary included in this set is called New Zealand: The Home of Middle Earth. Its basically a six-and-a-half minute travel promotion which shows how various places on the island nation were turned into parts of Tolkiens Middle Earth. It includes an animated map and has various members of  the cast talking about the appeal of the countrys spectacular scenery. Its actually entertaining, but its short.

The best I can tell, the few totally new scenes added in this extended edition are mostly located at the start of each of the two disks the movie has been divided into for this set, although theyve all been added to this presentation of the film in sequence of the story  rather than as a separate menu of added scenes. This means you have to watch the whole film to see the new stuff, but it also means you see it in context.

Towards the beginning of the disk one, theres a brief new scene where a very young Bilbo meets Gandalf. After the scene where adult Bilbo encounters Gandalf outside his front door, theres a short new scene where Bilbo goes into Hobbiton to buy the fish which Dwalin the dwarf eventually eats at Bilbos table. At the beginning of disk two, theres four short new scenes all set in the elves city of  Rivendell. In the first, Bilbo is enjoying a view of the waterfalls from a veranda and Lord Elrond comes along and has this little conversation with him. The two share a moment of humor and depart, but its nice because the theatrical version didn't have these two interacting on a one-on-one basis at all. Then theres a wordless scene where Bilbo wanders into the hall where the shards of Isuldurs famous sword are kept and he sees a painting depicting Sauron wielding the one ring. Then Elrond and his assistant come upon the dwarves frolicking in a Rivendell fountain. Theres also a new scene where Bilbo and Thorin overhear Elrond talking to Gandalf about the history of mental illness in Thorins family.

The rest of the new material consists of extended versions of scenes already in the theatrical version. In the early scene which sets up the backstory the dwarves city of Erebor and the surrounding human town of Dale, the extended edition shows a little more how the dwarves and Wood Elf King Thranduil came to be at odds, and slightly  more of the destruction of Dale by the dragon Smaug (although it really doesnt show any more of that character). In the scene where Gandalf meets with Suramon, Elrond, and Galadrial, theres an extra bit of conversation where they reference the rings of power and the one ring and Suramon expresses his belief that it was washed into the sea and will remain lost forever. Also in Rivendell, but towards the end of disk one, the scene where the dwarves are eating dinner hosted by the elves is extended with new footage where Bofur interrupts the elves harp and flute music to jump onto the table and sing a bawdy pub song and the scene ends with a food fight, much to the elves dismay. When the dwarves are captured and taken to Goblintown, this sequence is extended by an additional song by the Great Goblin and a little more conversation with the dwarves. There may be a few extra seconds added elsewhere, but these are the ones I noticed.

A long debate could probably be had over how much the new material really enhances the film.  After all, it really doesnt change anything or add significantly to the plot. But for me, Peter Jacksons version of Middle Earth is a place I love to visit and any chance to linger a little longer is welcome, especially when the added footage melds relatively seamlessly with what was in the theatrical version. In my opinion, if you only want to own one version of this film, this would be the one to have.",1384387200,6,4549,4.63151364764268

I like the first edition of this movie, saw it several times in the theatre.  This version is even better.

Briefly, ***spoilers***
-Backstory is expanded with more background on Thorin's ascension as the dwarves leader.
-The time in Hobbiton is expanded and justly so.  While not quite as good as the scenes in FOTR, it does recapture the essence of hobbit-life.  Even a young Bilbo and Gandalf (face not seen.)
-The arrival of the 13 is expanded as well.  I love the interaction between them.  As I watched these scenes, I could not help but feel there was some message to it.  As in ""screw you pompous book purists and elitist middle-classers"".  Just have fun and don't take everything so seriously.  Very happy to have the 13 in almost ""book-form"".
-More time in Rivendell.
-The Great Goblin song and dance is back!

The extended/new scenes are great bonuses, just as they were in LOTR (I actually hadn't seen the theatrical versions of LOTR until after I had seen the extended editions about a billion times, and I always felt like so much was missing). It's perfectly understandable why these were not included in the theatrical version, but I'm so glad they were put in for the extended editions.

Of course, similar to the movie, if one is expecting the book of The Hobbit exactly, you'll be disappointed. But what I love about Peter Jackson's Hobbit is that he explores many details of Tolkien's world and tries to bridge the gap between The Hobbit and LOTR. Is it necessary? Not at all, or else Tolkien would have done it that way. But I do think it's incredibly fun and interesting to see things fleshed out more. I know the story of the book well, so it's just great to be able to see Jackson's adaptation, including the addition of things created by Tolkien and things Jackson and his team created--again, it is, after all, an adaptation, and in my mind, a great one.

A brief breakdown of the extended scenes:

-More of Erebor. You get to see a little more of Erebor and its wealth, as well as more tension between the Dwarves and the Elves--an offering of gems is made to King Thranduil, but taken away once he tries to take it.

-Slightly more of Smaug. Not much at all, and I didn't even notice this edition until I read it on another site, but you do see an extremely quick flash of his silhouetted body. Which, on that note, this is one thing that I never minded when seeing the movie--a lot of people wanted to see more of Smaug, but I actually liked this choice better. I definitely wanted to see more of Smaug because of how excited I was to see him, but in this scene, the unseen Smaug works better, in my opinion. But to each his own.

-More of Hobbiton. This was one of my favorite additions--we get to see quite a bit more of Hobbiton (which is now permanently built into the hills in New Zealand--I definitely need to visit that before I die). We see a party much like Bilbo's birthday party in Fellowship but this time Bilbo is a child, and at one point hits Gandalf with a wooden sword, which is completely adorable. Later, you see Biblo walking through the marketplace in Hobbiton as he's shopping and trying to avoid Gandalf. I love Hobbiton, and having these scenes was great.

-Probably more of the Dwarves in Bilbo's house. I couldn't tell you what they were, but the scene did feel slightly longer--perhaps just my imagination.

-A lot more of Rivendell. All very short scenes, but there's quite a few of them. There's more of the Dwarves eating, including one of my now-favorite scenes where Bofur stands up on the table (quite rudely) and starts singing a pub song (which is actually a song from The Fellowship of the Ring that Frodo sings, who says he learned it from Bilbo. I believe it's Jackson who explains in the Appendices that it's up to the viewer to decide if Bilbo learned it after Bofur sung it, or if Bilbo had taught it to Bofur before--I like both ideas, really). I just love songs like this, and hope to see more in the next two movies. You also see more of Bilbo exploring Rivendell (including looking at the image of Sauron fighting Isuldur behind the shards of Narsil that you see in Fellowship). You also hear Elrond and Gandalf discuss the quest, and the White Council scene is extended as well.

-The Goblin King. This is quite possibly my favorite new scene, because the Great Goblin sings a song based on the text in the book. It really adds a bit to his (and the goblins as a whole) character, and on top of that it's just a really fun song. It's out of tune and very goblin-y and torture-filled, but I still loved it. ""Down in the Deep of Goblin Town."" There's various other small bits added to the goblin scenes, too.
There may have been a little more of the pale orc, but I can't remember anything specifically. Probably a few other small scenes I missed.

I'm really only disappointed with two things:

1. That the ""Riddles in the Dark"" were not extended. There's more in the book, and I completely understand only having the ones they did in the theatrical version, but I just wish more had been added in the extended edition. This was my single favorite scene of the whole movie (I mean seriously, Andy Serkis just did such a supurbly amazing and fantastic job--Martin Freeman, too), and I would love to have seen a longer version. Ah, well; and

2. I wish that the ""Misty Mountains"" song was extended. The song in the book is much longer, and I just absolutely love the melody in the movie. I wish they could have made it longer.

One thing that I thought was a little funny was how the extended edition is kind of similar to the Fellowship extended editions. Both mark their half-way points (Disk 2) in Rivendell, both have the cast running from goblins in the second half of the film, both start with Hobbiton. . . . Not a bad thing at all, IMO, but yeah.

Overall, I love the extended scenes in An Unexpected Journey, and I still love the movie as a whole. I still couldn't help to feel that some of the time the digital effects were a little much. I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, but LOTR just felt so real to me, and in The Hobbit, some things seem more obviously digital. Maybe it's just nostalgia or something, but yeah.

The movie also seems to have a constant struggle between being a kid's movie and not. The movie is by far much darker than the book, which I didn't mind, but there's also moments that it seems so close to the feel of the book that it feels much more kid-ish. LOTR seemed to have a much more consistent tone throughout the movie. It had light-hearted (Hobbiton, for example) and comedic moments, yet those scenes didn't seem to change the overall tone at all as it sometimes did in The Hobbit.

I also would have loved to have more focus on the dwarves individually. Viewing the Appendices, you can see just how much detail and depth they went into creating individual personalities for every dwarf, but I didn't feel like enough of that went into the film. Yeah, they're still more fleshed out than they were in the book overall, but just knowing how much work they put in to making each dwarf a singular character, it made me want even more for them to be more individualized. However, considering the sheer numbers, I do have to commend them for the job that they did, because that's an extremely hard thing to do. Doesn't mean I don't wish they could've been fleshed out slightly more, though, especially in the extended edition (which they were, but I wanted even more =P).

I still wish the dwarves could've had their colored hoods and instruments, I still wish the troll scene could have been a little closer to the book (though I do like some of the changes they made), I still wish the stone giants were just in the distance (though this doesn't bother me too much at all), I still wish the tree scene at the end would've been different . . . but overall I do love the film, especially the extended edition.

I have yet to watch the film commentaries, but I suspect I will soon enough--the Appendices, as I've said, were really great to watch, though.

Part 7 (which is actually two disks, instead of the usual one--parts 1-6 were covered in LOTR) is titled ""A Long-Expected Journey"" and covers a lot of pre-production; includes a great introduction where Jackson explains how the film came to be and how he came to be director once again; the actors' boot camp and various other training; the shooting of the film and the various sets; pick-up shooting; and more.

Part 8, ""Return to Middle-Earth"" further details the development, design, and production of The Hobbit, and explores in-depth the background of the main characters and the casting for said characters. There's a section on creating the dwarves as a whole, and how Jackson wanted to do for the dwarves what Tolkien did for the elves, and really go in-depth to their past and history and life. It also shows the concepts, creation, and design of the various sets (both physical and digital), and lastly, there's a look at the songs of The Hobbit.

The first disk of the movie also has ""New Zealand: Home of Middle-Earth"" which is a cool look into the various places in NZ that were used for the film.

I always loved watching the Appendices to LOTR, and The Hobbit was no different. I would definitely recommend this five-disk set--the extended edition of the film is amazing, and all the special features/appendices are just really great and interesting, too.

There was almost no story to this waste of my time movie. Greed destroys everything, movies, government, the world. The producers and director of this movie should be ashamed.

4635316,4,B0059XTU1S,"Story: 3 stars  Quality: 4 stars  3D: 5 stars  Special Features: 4 stars

I know we all want to look at this movie separate from LOTRs, but we can't. We want to buy the extended because the extra footage from LOTRs made LOTRs a better movie. This extended version of The Hobbit does not make it a better movie. It doesn't make it a bad movie. It's pretty much the same with 30 extra minutes. I did not feel the story was expanded in a better way and I did not feel the characters were explained in more detail. The pacing felt a little slower because of the extra 30 minutes. There is a lot more singing in this version, I will say that. It has two more musical numbers in it which makes that four songs in total. If you didn't read the book then the songs will mean nothing, but fans of the book will love more of the songs. It began to feel like a musical though.
If you are on the fence about whether or not to buy the extended or the theatrical it all depends on if you don't mind watching 30 minutes more of this movie.
If you already own the theatrical version I would recommend renting the extended first and seeing how you like it. I will recommend if you have a 3D TV or plan to get one in the future then get this version. The 3D is amazing. I actually like the 3D on the blu-ray more than I did in the theater.

I had the other Blu-ray version of this movie which included the production diaries. This version does not include those. They do include many great documentaries on the production of the movie, but I miss having the production diaries. There are about 9 hours of documentaries. I had trouble getting back to the main menu of the features. Once I selected Play All I could not go back to the beginning from the remote.

Give us back the 'Digital' option made for Itunes, we pay enough for the product and should get it, or have BOTH options I should think. And about Flixster, what a pain that is. You go to the Ultraviolet site to get your digital copy only to find yourself re-directed to Flixster where you have to jump thru hoops and create an account there. You can't even stream the stuff if you don't have a 1080p display, it won't let you. The 'click on SD' option when the streaming starts doesn't even work, the streaming still won't play on a 720p diaplay. You need to actually 'download' the whole movie, which will then only play with the Flixster player that you have to download too, which has almost no screen adjustment options when compared to the many Itunes player screen options. That means taking up space on the hard drive with yet another copy of the film, which was the thing to avoid to begin with.

4635334,5,B0059XTU1S,"As a long time Tolkien fan I could hardly wait for the release of the movie version of the HOBBIT.  Of course I purchase the first edition of the
DVD of this film from AMAZON and since ordered the 3D versions in Blue ray as well as conventional DVDs.  I have only watched the theatrical version on
the standard DVD and am impressed with the near HD quality of the images.  I do not however like the idea of the film being in three parts since the
book is fairly short and easy to read. And Tolkien himself was not happy with the story after he finished: he wished he had made it more for adults.
Well, the film accomplished that alright and beautifully well.  Still, two films could have covered the book easily. Peter Jackson, a fine director,
likes to expand original stories as he did with the LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG.  He almost ruined KK with a silly ending, but it was OK.
  Here he remains pretty faithful to the book with added violence though I guess that is what people want today.  Still, I loved it with an excellent
cast and I understand some returnies in  the next edition.  Splendid special effects, especially in the underground caves..kinda creepy.  I have yet
to visit the extras on the discs though I love motion picture production stuff: a field I wish I had gotten into.  If you don't know the story but liked the theatrical film, you will love this DVD.  Wait until you see the next films; there is a great dialog scene between Bilbo the Burglar and
Smaug the dragon.  I love dragon stories.  I gave this film five stars and guess what? no Dr Sweets...Yeah!!  Though I would enjoy seeing the dragon
eat Dr Sweets...Enjoy!!",1383955200,,1652,4.420529801324503
4635335,1,B0059XTU1S,"This rating is purely for the added scenes. For the non-extended version, I would have give about a 3+. For the extended version, I'm very disappointed. Sadly, Jackson, in an attempt to add humor and exaggerate the rude barbarism of the dwarves, put in a scene of them all playing in a pool naked, in Rivendell. In addition to that, there was other unnecessary, suggestive humor, that Tolkien never put in.

Why slide in trash?! It drives me crazy. I sit down to enjoy a perfectly decent story, and I get debased MTV/Hollywood garbage.

Pros: There was a couple of minutes that meaningfully added to the movie.
1) Showing Bilbo, as a child, playing with Gandalf.
2) Slightly extended sequence between Thranduil and Thror.
2) Slightly extended dialog between Gandalf and Saruman at Rivendell.

In the LOTR, Jackson's humility was prevalent through the ""behind-the-scenes"" materials. In these, he's more non-chalant, as though he's ""arrived"". I think his successes and his abuse of CGI, have caused him to become careless in the quality of his work.

Disappointing is the best way to sum up my opinion.

As for the movie itself, I couldn't be more pleased that Peter Jackson decided to follow George Lucas' lead in introducing some modern-day silliness.  Jar Jar Binks has nothing on Radagast the Brown!  And there is no shortage of situations where there is plot-altering, certain doom for the little gang, only to be saved by wild luck!  I'd love to see Jackson take future installments even further in that direction with more baffling escapes and more goofball characters.  I mean, watching movies IS supposed to be fun, right?

First, the Goblins were not AT ALL what I pictured when reading the books, they also aren't even any sort of ""throwback"" to the Goblins in the classic old animated film ""The Hobbit""...(Down Down to Goblin Town anyone??) I was really looking forward to this scene, as it is such a dark and unnerving turn in the book. I was so upset with the stupid humor and ridiculous portrayals of these guys. This film made it into a joke scene...literally! (""That'll do it...""???) I feel it really ruined what could have been an amazing part of the film, and it was an insult to the spirit of the Goblins in the book.

Secondly...the Trolls. Here is another classic scene from Tolkien royally destroyed in this film. Once again, the overplay of ""stupid"" humor...the booger joke, for example...was absolutely insulting to the viewer. Perhaps lowbrow children will laugh during the scene, but for a true fan this was huge disappointment.

I so wish these scenes could be chopped and thrown out. They need to be treated with respect and completely redone. Obviously that will never happen, and so for me this version of the film will NEVER be the definitive version. I will be patiently waiting for another director to redo these films in 50 years down the road, and treat them seriously and with respect. No more Jar Jars.",1383782400,7,1375,4.7012448132780085

However it carries on far too long, the musical scenes should have been completely cut out along with 90% of the Elvish scenes, the goblin action scenes are some of the silliest action I've ever watched, and there is a massive problem with the story.

**Spoiler Ahead!**

If Gandalf can simply summon eagles at will to carry the group anywhere they want to go without limitation, then why not use them all the time? They were constantly being attacked on land by stone giants, trolls, goblins, orcs, and then at the end **POOF!** he summons giant eagles to fly them all much closer to the mountain, saving time and even more anguish.

And all of the movie extras, bookends, Gollum, Minas Tirith, even Minas Morgul. This statue is the equal at least of anything before. WETA could offer it as a stand alone and easily charge the $70 for it. Gollum is done very impressively well. He is spot on and amazing expression detail given his size. The Bilbo face is not as well done and is the weak link. But still the clothes and colors are great on Bilbo and the face is acceptable. It is definitely WETA worthy.

You also get a box with art so good by my favorite Tolkien artist, Alan Lee, that it is another gift item in and of itself. Charming picture of Gandalf looking down into the Shire and Bag End. Also a picture of Bilbo standing against the white Orc Azog on warg. As far as I know at least that picture is unique to this box set.

The 3D is among the best I have seen in a movie rivaling the IMAX 3D discs I have that had been better than movies. I could have gone for 50 minutes more of this movie. But the 13 mins included are delightful. They are some of the more lighthearted scenes: more of Hobbiton, much more of the dwarves having fun in Rivendell, a bit more of the goblin king. It is all seemless and the only downside is you are left wanting more. Each time I watch the Hobbit I like it more. It seems like every lesson learned on the LOTR films was applied here. The acting is top notch and the reviews for this film are, in general, vastly under-rated. It is a more than worthy addition to Jackson's Tolkien work.

For those wondering on statue quality it is among the best of the movie inclusions. Perhaps the bookends are next best. And rivals a WETA buy alone product. Gollum is particularly well done, his expression is just fantastic.",1383696000,,1826,4.317784256559767

First, I will preface with the fact that I was a big fan of the extended editions for LOTR so having nearly 3 hours of movie was not daunting for me like it is for some others. Watched in theaters, and loved the longer scenes here. There are enough reviews about the movie out there so I will leave you to finding those on your own.

Mostly I wanted to review to post my opinion of the statue with this set. Simply put, it is amazing. the quality of what you get is top notch. Sometimes you see the promotional items in photo and such from the manufacturer and when you get yours you are stuck wondering if yours was one of the last ones from that mold before it was completely worn out. That's not the case here, the details are all there and it isn't some lightweight cheap material either. I have seen similar quality statues go for more than this entire set, it really is that good.",1383609600,4,936,4.229050279329609
4635401,5,B0059XTU1S,"I'll admit I'm not all of the way through things yet... but there is a heck of a lot on this set to get through!

I've watched the film. I was certainly curious what new footage would be added to what was already a somewhat embellished (some less kind people may even say bloated) version of the tale of The Hobbit... The additions actually worked quite nicely. The addition of the Goblin Town song was worth the proverbial price of admission, alone!

I haven't listened to the commentary track, but I look forward to it. It is a bit disappointing to only have one track, as I enjoyed the each of four that were on the various extended LOTR films... but I won't hold that against this release. I will enjoy what we do have rather then lament what I wish we could have had.

What I have done is gotten part way through the appendices. I'm three hours into the roughly nine hours worth of documentary footage. This is what I was most looking forward to on this release, and most worried might not live up to my expectations.

What were those expectations? Well, when it came to The Lord of the Rings, the excellent behind the scenes material within the appendices wove a tale that was, in my opinion, just as compelling as that within the narrative of the films. I felt like I got to know not only the usual suspects of the actors and the director, but many of the other usually invisible people who worked on the film. I felt like I was taken along on the journey with them. I became emotionally invested in their tale. I felt genuine sadness as the filming of The Return of the King came to the end, and everyone started saying goodbye to each other... I felt as if I was saying goodbye to them, as well. It had just the same, if not greater, emotional impact as within the film itself when Frodo was saying goodbye to Sam as he was preparing to pass into the west...

This was a lot to live up to. Would the behind the scenes tale of The Hobbit be able to recapture that magic? Well, I am only three hours in, about a third of the way into what will theoretically be only a third of the final tale once the last part of The Hobbit comes out... And I am pleased to say that it looks like the magic has been recaptured. I feel like I am seeing old friends once again, and meeting new friends along with them. I feel like I am reliving fond memories and forming new ones.

Their tale can still tug at me. And I am glad to be along for the ride once more.",1383609600,10,2452,4.206382978723404
4635402,5,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson delivered the first film of THE HOBBIT trilogy to a great deal less acclaim than was received by any of the films in the Lord of the Rings cycle. When I first saw THE HOBBIT (in digital 48 frame per second projection), I did not understand the disappointment. I thought the film fully delivered. And the Extended Edition delivers even more. Without doubt, I can say that this will become the version I look to when I wish to screen the series. This film down not have as much new material as was added to the films in the first trilogy. Undoubtedly, Jackson has the confidence of the studios and can now create and deliver a ""Tolkien film"" of virtually whatever length he wants. There's no need to leave out a story line to save time. I can't imagine a studio executive getting nervous over Peter Jackson (and Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) working with this material. Consequently, there is less meat to pack onto the bones. What's there, though, is at least pleasing and at best thrilling. I never thought I'd get LOTR or THE HOBBIT on film with such care...or that the films would become such popular successes. My son (to whom I read ""Shelob's Lair"" at age 5) and I agree that this is a multi-million dollar fan project and everyone else can just come along for the ride. Thankfully, there are millions of fans.

I have not yet completed the Appendices, but what I have viewed gives me full faith and confidence that Team Jackson is packing in detail far past the ordinary ""Making of..."" featurettes. The package also includes this little statue (little, hah!) of Gollum regarding Bilbo from above just before starting their game of Riddles in the Dark. It's lovely and worth the cost of the item entirely on its own. The video and audio (viewed on a 57"" DLP screen with 7.1 DTS-HD Master sound) is delightful.

4635436,1,B0059XTU1S,"I can't believe Peter Jackson, who I really respect, would stoop to such blatant marketing ploys simply for money.

Does anyone remember Tarantino's Grindhouse which was great in the theater after which he brought it out for release to the public in two separate DVD's simply for money.  He clearly scammed a lot of people.  There were millions of complaints and Tarantino had to apologize for his misguided attempt to dupe the public and then released the original Grindhouse in its original format and as it was meant to be seen.

Jackson and Co. are essentially the same thing by coming out with three (3) count em, three movies of the Hobbit, a small introductory book for children.  The actual Lord of the Rings consisted of three books and resulted in three movies each approximately 3 hours long.  Very reasonable.  Here we have the worst example ever of trying to squeeze the public into buying three separate movies, released over two or three years, at a total running length of 9 hours and at an initial cost to the public of approx. $75.

As mentioned, The Hobbit was merely the intro to the Lord of the Rings yet they've absurdly made in into three (3) movies also at the approx. aggregate running time of 9 hours.  How is this possible?  Why isn't everyone up in arms?  Each of the three books that made up the Lord of the Rings and associated DVD's were long enough and to turn a very short introductory story into three separate movies is worst kind of profiteering.

I am boycotting the movies and think if enough people say they're sick and tired of all the games and mercenary attitude of people and studios it might prevent this from happening again.  What's next, a six DVD version of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""?  Enough is enough and just remember when your watching a movie, as I was when I saw the Hobbit, or thought I was watching the Hobbit, expecting a good ending only to see the equivalent of a prompt on the screen that said ""to be continued"" To say I was very upset is an understatement.  I don't know if the producers adequately informed the public in advance of what they were doing but I had no idea this was just part one (1) and couldn't believe that at the end of the first installment nothing had happened.  That's the way I suspect a lot of people felt and should feel about what the producers, etc.., did regardless of how much money was spent or the quality of the production.  I'm certain they filmed the entire project at one time which also exacerbates the problem and wouldn't support triple billing of the public.  In essence, ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more"".  Neither should you",1383264000,14,2657,4.509394572025053
4635437,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey shows that Peter Jackson is back and better than ever. This has to be one of the most accurate book to movie adaptations ever done, and Jackson sticks to the books events all the way through, only adding more backstory that was touched on in the book, but was never fully explained. Thankfully Jackson draws much of the film's material from The Lord of the Rings appendices, which really makes the movie a lot more interesting. Many people may not realize this, but Tolkien actually spent a lot of time editing and revising the Hobbit to add more story and make it more similar in tone to LotR, but he just never got around to finishing and publishing it. Jackson realized this and tried to make his adaption more faithful to that fact, and that really shows how much respect for Tolkien and his work. It sticks to the events of the book, and smartly adds new character motives to explain why certain things happen, and why certain characters acted the way they did, which wasn't in the book. This review is for the actual movie itself though, and not this edition. In terms of the actual quality of the Blu-Ray disc, the Hobbit  may be the best looking Blu-Ray film I've ever seen. The landscape, CGI, acting, and the soundtrack are amplified by the supreme quality of the disc. Jackson really knows what he's doing with Blu-ray transfers.

Extraneous nonsense should not be allowed under penalty of being fed to the orcs. Disney productions have been infamous for breaking this unwritten rule in the pursuit of ""cute"" so that stories like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B003A83VUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>&nbsp;were ruined for me before I could even read. The Hobbit breaks it in pursuit of pretensions of grandeur and will sour the story for generations of children to come.

Sure there is great scenery. I mean, who could not like a film made on the south island of New Zealand. Some scenes are true to the book. I most liked the dishwashing scene during the unexpected party, with its musical rendition of the song of ""That's What Bilbo Baggins Hates"". In fact the music is the strongest positive all through the whole movie. The trolls' dialog is really funny as is much of the humorous byplay. Elves are beautiful. Gandalf is inscrutable. Wargs are scary. Et cetera. But we all know the positives since they are the same lines we memorized 40 or 50 years ago when we re-read the book for the tenth time.

That is about all the positive. For the negative I'll be brief, mostly with questions. A retrospective from the time of the birthday party? Frodo? Why insert dark material from the backstory? And what the hell are the Disney-esque brown wizard and his rabbits doing except wasting our time? A one armed semi-immortal Orc and a morbidly obese orc? Ten minutes of dancing mountains? Did he borrow the orc village from an Indiana Jones movie? Yeah. Right.

It is a children's story, meant to be read aloud to small children and to be an easy read for pre-teens. It is paced to introduce children to Tolkien's world not strangle them with drama. It delivers the backstory sparingly and in small bites, it is tightly written and well thought out. Its narration voice is not omniscient nor does it try to introduce themes beyond the limitations of its main character.

The entire point of ""The Hobbit"" is the idea that little people who have little goals and little abilities can still do great things if they believe in themselves. All the epic background events and deep history are meant to be deep in the background and not meant to take over the story line. It doesn't mix up the chain of events and it tells more with every re-reading. The movie misses this entirely.

This would have made a 4 or 5 star 30 minute first third of a 90 minute movie, leaving the delusions of grandeur on the cutting room floor. As it is, it is barely 3 stars and Bilbo's story is lost in the epic.

4635485,5,B0059XTU1S,"After bringing to life the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy around a decade ago (really?), Peter Jackson is now finishing the work he started by bringing to life J.R.R. Tolkien's original Middle Earth tale, The Hobbit, to life. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first in a planned trilogy (originally planned as only 2 movies) adapting the book, padded up a bit with extras from the Lord of the Ring appendices and other works such as The Silmarillion. What results is a more epic version of the beloved tale better incorporated into the mythos of middle-earth than the book itself.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is visually and thematically in line with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book is definitely a simpler story than it's Lord of the Rings companions, but after writing, Tolkien did try to link them and Jackson is taking the next step by integrating the appendices and other source material to really make the Hobbit feel like a true precursor to the epic.

The film, apart from the fantastic visuals, also has excellent casting. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo, the loveable, bumbling burglar. Although, for the sake of the movie (being part of a trilogy), Bilbo does step up his game a bit. Richard Armitage also shines as Thorin, the leader of the 13 dwarves that arrive at Bilbo's doorstep looking for the 14th member of their party. Of course, as usual, the returning cast also shine (such as Ian McKellan as Gandalf, and Ian Holm as the older Bilbo).

The main concern I had going into the movie related to the visual effects. For the previous movies, Jackson utilized lots of practical effects (extras and miniature sets). However in the Hobbit, the vast majority (if not all) of the creatures are CGI, as is most of the scenery. At parts, these effects are pretty obvious and slightly distracting, but the overall effect works.

Overall, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a great start to the second trilogy of middle earth movies. Peter Jackson does a great job of tying the everything together and tries his best to make it feel like a single, contained movie, but it definitely feels more like part of a whole, long movie.

Most all major movie series are based off of books, and none of them have followed the book exactly. To say that this one is horrible because it doesn't follow the books correctly is like saying that cats are horrible because they aren't exactly like there ferocious ancestors.

In written word, the beauty of the LOTR lies in its exquisite detail; conversely, the beauty of The Hobbit is in its elegant simplicity. It seems like Jackson is trying to make the Hobbit another LOTR, and that just isn't working for me. The movie, while visually spectacular, has no charm.

The one that got me the most was the way they did the character thorn. He didn't have a large nose or even a decent beard. His face looked too human. He didn't talk like you would expect from a dwarf.like a lot of the dwarves he also wasn't squatty looking just like short humans. Also with the character bilbo they seemed to stray from the book. Hobbits aren't completely helpless they can move quickly and quietly and aren't stupid. I also hated how most of the movie they treated him as an outcast while in the book he was truly part of the company. And wasn't always quiet in the back. he was a part of the adventure and there was hardly ever a word about bilbo not being able to fulfill his agreement. And hobbits are shorter than dwarves and chubbier with furry feet not just giant awkward feet with a little hair growing out of them. They also removed the fact that eagles talked to them after they were saved I'm worried they will do the same with smaug and the talk he and bilbo had was an interesting part of the book. And in the next movie the spiders talk while bilbo listens to what they plan to do with the dwarves. Plus the white Orc had nothing to do with the book but I'll admit that was a nice touch.  Don't get me wrong it's still a wonderful movie but if you haven't read the book yet wait until you've seen all the movies. I still give it 4stars",1381968000,5,1522,4.194539249146757

The theatrical release was, of course, all about Peter Jackson's interpretation of JRR Tolkein's wonderful imagination.  Purists and fans of pasty-faced suck-ups will probably find reasons to complain.  But for me, the scenery of New Zealand once again becomes Middle Earth.  And no, I don't expect a movie about wizards and dragons to be realistic.

Mind you, I do think the unhygienic Radagast is a bit too silly; but there are many lighthearted moments in the original works.  Just not so much bathroom humor.

4635543,3,B0059XTU1S,"Look, I get it.  THE HOBBIT is a whimsical children's tale, about a hobbit and 13 dwarves and a wizard attempting to recapture Erebor from Smaug, the fire-breathing, greedy (original 1 per center) dragon.  Dwarf names like Ori, Nori, Dori, Kili, Fili, only lend themselves to the light-hearted nature of this tale, originally written and published for children around 9 to 12 years of age.  It was a far cry from Tolkien's much more ominous, dark, brooding 'The Lord of the Rings'. . .which is why I'll never understand why terrific director/producer/writer Peter Jackson would even try to make such a silly story into a massive, three-part epic.  In order to do this, Jackson had to go back and mine the Appendices, and backstory, of 'Lord of the Rings'; the villain of this first installment of THE HOBBIT, Azog, is a product of the Appendices.  So what we have here, although it's a beautifully crafted, well-made, visually impressive film, is a 3-hour cartoon, sans the utter darkness of Jackson's previous presentation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>.  It is a wonderful film to watch, augmented by Howard Shore's haunting musical score, but it's an uneven, often thinly-veiled depiction of what should be a two-hour light snack.

I've got no problems with the cast, either; Ian McKellen returns as the wizard Gandalf, and Martin Freeman turns in an outstanding performance as Bilbo Baggins, 60 years previous than the Ian Holm depiction in 'Lord of the Rings'.  Other solid performances include a stern-looking Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, and I especially liked the performances of Graham McTavish (Dwalin), James Nesbitt (Bofur), and Aidan Turner (Kili).  From the original 'Lord of the Rings' production, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis, all return for brief appearances.  Yet the whimsical, child-like nature of this film springs forth in spades, from the gaudy haircuts/outfits of the dwarves, to the animated hordes of Orcs; again, all of this lends itself to the notion that THE HOBBIT in its entirety should have been a lighthearted, two-hour film.  It was grand to revisit gorgeous New Zealand, a character in itself as Middle Earth, and was grand to meet once again all the characters we have come to love from 'Lord of the Rings'.  But Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT:  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, the first installment of a massive three-part epic, is a mile wide, an inch deep, and a visual cartoon that meanders a tad too long.

4635549,3,B0059XTU1S,"I hate to give this beautiful, phenomenally acted movie a lukewarm rating, but I just can't get over the pace of this movie.

Before I get into why the three-movie format doesn't work for this story, I would like to state that I am a lifelong fan of Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, and Middle Earth. My dissatisfaction does not stem from a dislike of the franchise or the story, nor is it the result of a short attention span. While I have an enormous respect for the attention to detail that has gone into every Peter Jackson adaptation thus far, I believe there is also incredible power in brevity. If Tolkien has intended the stories contained in the appendices and notes to inform the main storyline in a major way, I believe they would have been included in the books. While the extra information and characters are interesting, all they serve to do in An Unexpected Journey is provide filler and drastically slow the pace of the narrative.

At its heart, The Hobbit, unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is a largely straightforward children's story. There's a journey, a battle, and a victory. I truly believe The Hobbit would have been a powerful single film, but as a third of a sweeping epic, it just doesn't work. None of this is to say that Tolkien's appendices are irrelevant, just that if he didn't consider them relevant enough to include in the story, turning a single short book into three (incredibly long) movies to include them is unnecessary.

That being said, I *love* Martin Freeman in the role of Bilbo, and the inclusion of Far over the Misty Mountains Cold was a pleasant surprise. You also get a sense for the dwarves' distinct personalities, a feature decidedly missing from Tolkien's narrative. I'm still looking forward to the future installations of The Hobbit, but truth be told, what I'd love to see at the end of all this is a good edit of all three movies into the length of one.",1381708800,4,1927,4.59593023255814

It was a book written as a young adult novel and the target audience for the movie seems perfect. I had forgot a few bits and pieces of the story so I enjoyed it coming to the big screen very much. It was like a smorgasbord of the book in living color. Not to see it would be a shame for any Tolkien fan and perhaps once I see the conclusion I might have to give this back the fifth star. After all, rewatching the lord of the rings trilogy in succession was much more meaningful to me and upped my impression more each time I viewed them. If you want to see Gandalf, Smeagle/Gollum and feel like you have seen one more part of Tolkien's world, this movie is definitely for you. The plot is simple, the journey is not.

Hobbit:  1 book, 3 movies  = cash-grab.

The first Hobbit movie was too long and painfully slow in parts.  And now they're releasing an extended edition?  How much can you stretch 1/3 of a book?

I can't believe this was made by the same people that made the LotR trilogy.  Length aside, it just wasn't FUN like the LotR films.  Much like the new Star Wars trilogy (with anakin & jar-jar) wasn't as fun as the first and real Star Wars trilogy.  But at least the new Star Wars films weren't boring like half of the first Hobbit film.",1380412800,,580,4.229357798165138

4635634,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let me just preface this review by saying I am not an ""only movie"" fan. Yes, I was introduced to the series by the movies, but I took the time to read the books, including the Hobbit. So do I know that this is only very loosely tied to the book? Yes. Do I think that if they had stuck true to the story, then it would have only needed to be one movie long? Yes. In fact, when I first heard about the trilogy, then I thought ""Peter Jackson, you had better perform a miracle or this is going to be a loooong few years."" I went to the movie with some apprehension, despite being a die-hard LOTR fan and a firm believer in Martin Freeman's acting capability.

But I was blown away.

This movie is beautiful. They manage to include elements from the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, as well as include elements that did actually happen during the Hobbit, but were only told about in the LOTR trilogy. I appreciate the character development they performed on Thorin, because in the book, let's face it, he was kind of a jerk. In the movie, the greed and pride in his character are still evident, but so is the nobility and loyalty to his people, making him much more enjoyable and lovable.

The acting was superb, of course. Ian McKellan and Martin Freeman proved to be an excellent duo, and the return of Andy Serkis was lovely.

To those who think that there were scenes that dragged: sorry if Peter Jackson can't adjust to your twenty-first century, 30 second attention spans. In a way, this made the movie more real to me, because the truth is that some things do take longer than three seconds, and one does not simply battle through an orc mountain without it taking some time.

To those that considered the dwarves to be irritatingly cartooney: That's how dwarves are. Read the book, and you'll find that they generally weren't dignified at all times. They were often childish and a little bit immature. They did break out in song, frequently. They did perform that scene with Bilbo's dishes. I'd rather cartooney than unrealistically serious at all times. Dwarves have a sense of humor.

To those who haven't seen it yet: enjoy.",1380326400,,2132,4.524675324675325

4635669,2,B0059XTU1S,"To be fair to the director it's hard to top the Epic Saga of LOTR Trilogy, and anyone who has read the Book would likely expect a lighter and less epic adventure then the Lord of the Rings.  Still I was expecting a series movie with a decent story and great dialog.  Unfortunately this film is greatly dumbed down.  The Trolls are dumber, the action scenes are very cliche, and the introduction of the BROWN WIZARD is real shift from what was an amazing Saga, to a Cartoonish Spinoff.  This Film reminded me so much of Star Wars the Phantom Menace. When George Lucus produced the Prequels, they really seemed to be cheap imitations of what was once original and mesmerizing.  They had amazing Special Effects and Stunning Computer Graphics, but the character lines were cheesy, the storyline dull and unoriginal, action scenes were punctuated by long drawn out awkward scenes, and of coarse Jar Jar Binks.  The Hobbit bears many of the same shortcomings.  The dialogue is not that great, there many long drawn out scenes punctuated by action scenes that come across as more comical and childish then serious.  Worst of all is that Jar Jar Binks-like character, The Brown Wizzard, No offense to Mr. Binks, he's the man if your a kid, but cartoonish characters don't belong in classic epics made for adults. They belong in Pixir or Disney movies for young kids who don't care about dialog or plot but just want to see something witty with some action scenes. The scene of The Brown Wizzard flying through the forest on a sled pulled by deer was a real turnoff for me, and made me think I was watching a children's movie. This film is great if your Eleven, or Seven, or even 14, but if your 25 and older and enjoy serious movies with a complex plot and well written scenes, then you may be in for an Unexpected Travesty.",1379980800,19,1817,4.569230769230769

When you buy Ultraviolet your rights are taken away from you. Why would WB do this to such a magnificent movie? This is just as bad as the music industry trying to collar people.

4635672,4,B0059XTU1S,"I was pleased with the acting and the representation of the key plot elements of the original books.  Not to mention the production values.

That said, unlike LOTR, there isn't really three movies worth of material in the Hobbit.  Peter made up for this a little by working in Tolkien content from other stories and from staging scenes and events that take place ""off camera"" in Tolkien's works.  I was okay with that, too, even the silly parts like the rabbit sled and Saruman's prevarication.  But scenes that took only a few pages in Tolkien went on and on and on. Scenes like the dwarf takeover of Bilbo's house and the goblin battles could be cut down by half or more and you wouldn't miss ANYTHING.  Well, you might have a 90 minute movie with 90 minutes worth of material, as opposed to a 2-plus hour movie with 90 minutes worth of material.

I bought the DVD instead of the Blue Ray because I want it in my library. I'll probably even watch it again with friends over.  But it wasn't worth the extra money to see every wart on the head goblin's belly, if you get my drift.

Of course much of the interesting demonstrations and explanations of how sets, costumes, implements, etc.were made were extremely well-done in the Ring Trilogy.

and entertaining adventure.
Does it match the book, word-for-word, chapter-for-chapter. No, and I don't
expect that from the other two releases. That said, as a movie it's awesome.
Seems like every reader of Tolkien's books has a mental image of how and what
the characters and landscape should look like. If you're a purist, stick to the books.

The Misty Mountain song just was used to much for my taste.  It became a challenge to see how many different tempos they would attempt to play that song in this movie.  All in all I liked it but felt it could have been better.,1378771200,,363,3.8

The problem for me is that everything is shot like LOTR. I mean, exactly. Every single part of this movie feels exactly the same as all the LOTR movies, especially the Return of the King. Even the music is exactly the same.

Sure, it's great to have continuity, but this film has no character of its own. After the LOTR trilogy, it's just tiring and overdone.

Will I see the next installment? Sure, I love Tolkien and the world he created, and I'll want to watch how it's brought to life on screen.

Such large epics, now I see a extended version is on the way, have so much going on you have to see it more than once to appreciate all the details.  This is true with Mr. Freeman's performance.

4635785,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings stories are simply amazing. The books opened an entire world of diverse characters from the Elves & Dwarves to Man & Beasts. J.R.R. Tolkien introduced a world so detailed, it actually includes family trees of characters and their lineage, as well as a full scale look at the plants and trees and their origins, uses and so much more. It's almost unbelievable. As shown in the Lord of the Rings Movie franchise, a lot of content is not included that was in the books, but the story and diversity of time and locations is not missed. the LOTR Movies are amazingly depicted. I found that was also carried over to the newly introduced prequel: the Hobbit. In some ways, I actually liked the Hobbit movie more so than the LOTR Trilogy. It's not as action packed as the LOTR Movies, but there is so much emotional power which is so well displayed by the characters (a great cast of actors was used for this movie)and scenery, whether its animated or not. The animation is top notch (for now anyway) and it blends in so well it's incredible. Most importantly, Bilbo is played by an amazing actor - not sure what his name is - but oh man, he does such a good job in this, there are times you just want to pick that little hobbit up and squeeze the life out of him (in a nice way). If you haven't seen it, and liked the LOTR books or movies, you will undoubtedly love this movie. I have yet to see the 3D version, but without 3D, this movie is too good! I want the 3D version since I have the set up to view, but I already bought the standard blu-ray edition and don't want to fork out another $35 bucks for an extra blu-ray copy, dvd and digital copy only to see the 3D version and think to myself, that could have been way more 3D-ish!

4635864,3,B0059XTU1S,"Obviously, there is a lot of love for this film, and that is great. However, I do not think that Peter Jackson and the other producers deserve any real pats on the back for this one. It is a steep, steep step down from the Lord of the Rings, and more to the point, not nearly as good as it could have/should have been on its own terms. But I will concede that it is fine as lively, varied adventure film, entertainment value if you will. So there is that.

The good points include most of the casting, the expectedly rich set and costume design, and the pitch-perfect portrayal of Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, which is easily the best scene in the film. There are some nice moments of humor, some reassuring familiar faces, and a few glimpses of some of the Hobbit-specific elements that will be the focus of the next film. And I have to mention how much I love the low, moody song that the dwarves sing about going to the Misty Mountains. A wondrous bit of character music, there.

On the other hand, the fact that the producers are misguidedly trying to use the Hobbit (a relatively short, unpretentious adventure tale) as a host-body for another epic LOTR-style trilogy is painfully, awkwardly evident all over this film. The pacing at the beginning is ridiculous. It is obviously dragging on simply to fill a running-time quota (and not a brief running time). So much for the artistic merit of stretching the Hobbit across three films. There are many added-in characters and plot elements. Some of them may be sourced from Tolkien's other writings, and thus technically canon, but in almost no case here to they really make the story any better, if indeed they do not make it worse. Finally, there are the visual effects. They seem much more cartoonish and CGI-centric than what I recall from Peter Jackson's previous films. Which is to say, cheaper. Some of the humor is also far cheaper than it has any business to be in a Tolkien film. But I could just go on...

Ultimately, to me it is very painfully clear that financial ambitions gained the upper hand over artistic integrity. There is nothing wrong with enjoying this film of course, but it represents a sad regression from the exceptionally high level of craftsmanship and fidelity that governed the LOTR films. One might argue that the Hobbit should not be compared to LOTR, and I agree. The problem here is that the filmmakers missed that memo themselves, thus this film is not really trying to be the Hobbit so much as another Fellowship of the Ring. Which it is not. The result of that identity crisis is that, in my opinion, this is a mediocre-to-decent film at best.",1377648000,2,2636,4.616204690831556

I'm a big Tolkien fan and I don't think anyone could have put these books to movies any better than what Peter Jackson and his team have done.  The statue and the work put into it looks fantastic - Its theme, 'Riddles in the Dark', is one of the best parts of the book and now movie.

1. More of DALE, including the BLACK ARROWS. Director Peter Jackson mentions a previously unseen character: ""Girion, who is defending [the city of] Dale using black arrows against Smaug. And the black arrows play a part in an ongoing story, for they are the one thing that can pierce the dragon's hide.""

2. More king of the wood elves; THRANDUIL. Peter Jackson: ""There are also issues with Thranduil. We get some of the reason why he and the dwarves had a falling out - to do with these white gems...""

3. More of HOBBITON. Producer Phillipa Boyens: ""You are going to get more of Hobbiton. We always wanted to wend our way through Hobbiton, but in the end Bilbo has to run out of the door.""

4. The OLD TOOK'S PARTY: In which we see a younger Gandalf meet Bilbo Baggins as a young child, convincing the wizard of the young hobbit's bravery and courage. I won't spoil it for you, but it involves a dragon and a bit of magic.

5. Dwarf antics at RIVENDELL. Peter Jackson: ""You are going to get some serious Dwarvish disrespect of the elves at Rivendell.""

6. A scene between BILBO AND ELROND, in which Elrond speaks to Bilbo about his QUEST.

7. The SONG of the GOBLIN KING. Producer Fran Walsh: ""You are going to get more Goblin Town, and the Great Goblin singing his song. It is a great song, but it was just another delay in terms of moving the story along."" Peter Jackson: ""A number one hit from the Goblin King. Barry Humphries is going to rise up the charts!""

Almost gave it three stars but that would not be fair because I would be basing that on the first three. What I loved about the first three movies is that you just loved the characters. Heck LoTR is one of the few movies I find myself thinking about even when I'm not watching it for the twentieth time. Sadly though that is not what you get with this movie. The truth is Martin Freeman is just not good enough to carry the torch passed to him. Not horrible he would make a decent secondary character but not the main role. Once the movie is done you think to yourself that was good and that is about it. Don't really care if you see the next one or not. From a visual standpoint top notch they really do good work.

Watch and find out.

This is the beginning of ""There and back again"" not worth viewing until you have the complete story in hand.

The story starts off with a token view of our original beloved characters by the original actors. An observation is that the story starts out excruciatingly slow and takes a good chunk of time to get off the ground. Yet this may be on purpose as with any movies it is best to introduce the characters about to take the journey and their Hobbits... Oops their habits.

For people that are interested in technology as much as the story presented it may be premature to purchase anything for a while until all the different versions are sorted out. We already have Blu-ray and digital. And by the time you find this review probably 3D so we can watch a lame rabbit sled. Then there is the denser version of Blur-ray, probably another try of smell-o-vision, seat bottom vibrations, interactive-conversations, etc.

Avoid using rental services as they are using the crippled (missing all the DVD extras) rental version of the DVD.

I can easily go two ways on this presentation. First it tries to fit the general feel of the LOTR movies and the ""Hobbit"" book which is really different in character. So this is more of a LOTR prequel.

 Having a lot of the same actors helped with consistency, as always we must have new actors; yet that splits the viewers into the two camps of one's following the story and the other's saying this is not the same actors (good or bad). I suggest that it is worth a viewing to decide for yourself.

4636015,4,B0059XTU1S,"Being a long-time Tolkien fan I am well aware where the powers that be took some artistic liberties with this story, and can fully understand some of the criticisms of this particular film, but those didn't ruin the experience for me in the least; in fact, I was fine with many of the changes. As is usually the case with book-to-movie adaptations, changes from the source material were to be expected, but I couldn't say that all of them made sense both story-wise and necessity. Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a trilogy about the singlular story called There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale and it is presented in the awe-inspiring Peter Jackson format.

While I agree with those who feel a trilogy of 3-hour movies was not necessary for this one story, as an obvious money-grab, I very much appreciated the depth given to the Dwarves' plight with Smaug and some of the additions through use of the appendices and Silmarillion. What I personally didn't care for was a few unnecessary changes to the dialog, particularly during the Troll scene and riddle game with Gollum, and the addition of Azog, with his followers attacking in the daylight no less. The pale orc's entire purpose was a very weak plot point IMO, to wipe out the line of Durin. Thorin is the last one in that family line and he's a poor nomad, so the footnote character's addition would be more putting him out of his misery than some vague desire for revenge. Why PJ et al decided to use a dead character instead of Azog's son, Bolg, who will make an appearance later anyway, is beyond me; plus avenging your father's death is a much better rationale for diverting from the source material. I also felt a few scenes looked a bit cartoonish, such as with the trolls and goblins, more so than with LotR. Overall though, the visuals, score, and writing were excellent and fairly seamless.

As far as the actual product goes; it's that those who are still primarily using DVDs were remembered in regards to extras, but it still isn't very consistent. There's no reason why DVD and BR can't have the same special features, at least for the most part. However, in the collection of video blogs, provided in the special features, I found it amusing that until around the last 15 minutes (of more than 2 hours) they were talking about only 2 movies and showing us scenes that will be in the second film, since it wasn't approved to become a trilogy until late July 2012. In regards to the added 13 minutes for the extended edition, as it often happens with these things, I'm left wondering why some were edited out and other parts remained. Frankly, I felt around thirty minutes of the theatrical version could've been cut to not only `trim the fat' as it were, but also make the extended edition a more worthwhile product. There were a few gems in those 13 extra minutes, such as the song at Rivendell, but if you already have the regular version I'd recommend trying to catch the clips online before purchasing it to see if it suits your fancy.",1376611200,,3024,4.608534322820037

4636073,2,B0059XTU1S,"Disclosure: I have not read The Hobbit, so I do not know how accurate Peter Jackson is to the source material. That said, The Hobbit movie is an utterly predictable rehashing of LOTR's most notable moments, as if Peter Jackson had simply run out of ideas and re-filmed his favorite LOTR moments: Over-long chase scenes with things crashing? Check. Gandalf showing up in the nick of time? Check (3x). The One Ring haphazardly falling onto people's fingers? Check. The good guys escaping on giant birds? Check. At least we get a dragon this time that we, um, never really get to see. While the story is needlessly long - we wait 40 minutes just for Bilbo's decision to go on an adventure - there are other points that weigh this movie down. The first is the inexplicably terrible CGI; Jackson uses it for just about everything here and it looks fake 90% of the time. It appears as though for some reason, Jackson only saw fit to make sure Gollum was done correctly (which it was, amazingly so). Similarly, the wardrobe and make-up looks fake especially where the dwarves and Gandalf's hat are concerned. Then there's the matter of the dwarf leader who was so uncharismatic his name is not worth remembering. This element truly does the movie no good since he's a major character, but wait, isn't this movie about Bilbo? In fact, Bilbo (and to a lesser extent the dwarf leader) is about the only one who undergoes any character development and it's not much far too late into the movie. The Hobbit indicates for Jackson a director that is either trying too hard or not hard enough and it's tough to tell the difference. The result is that this film is more like Gandalf's 14 than a LOTR's pre-history. I think I will skip the next installment.",1376265600,5,1740,4.616129032258065
4636074,4,B0059XTU1S,"Many years ago, the dwarves of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, were driven from their home by Smaug, last of the great dragons. Thorin Oakenshield, the grandson of the last King of Erebor, has vowed to reclaim his home and called upon the dwarven clans of Middle-earth to aid him. Rebuffed, he instead plans a daring raid of a few chosen dwarves to slay Smaug whilst he sleeps. To aid them, Gandalf the Grey has promised to recruit a skilled burglar: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit of the Shire. Their journey will take them through forests and caverns, all the while being tracked by an old enemy of Thorin's...

An Unexpected Journey is the first movie in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit. That's Tolkien's short novel which, by word-count, is just under a fifth of the length of The Lord of the Rings. There's been enormous controversy about director Peter Jackson's decision to split The Hobbit into three three-hour films, with a fear that there simply isn't enough story to warrant it and this will result in padding. That is the threat that constantly hangs over the film and to be fair, it mostly avoids it by making a major change: Jackson has decided to show in full Gandalf and the White Council's side-story to confront and destroy the 'Necromancer' of Dol Guldur (a storyline that takes place off-page in the novel). Whilst also controversial amongst fans, it does give Jackson a rich vein of story to mine to add to proceedings, but how successful this will be remains to be seen (this subplot is only really started in the film).

The movie opens with the older Bilbo (still played by Ian Holm) writing an account of his adventure for Frodo and narrating the destruction of the human town of Dale and the neighbouring dwarven mountain-city of Erebor by Smaug. We then have the traditional opening from the novel, with thirteen dwarves and the wizard Gandalf turning up on Bilbo Baggins's doorstep to recruit him for an adventure. By the time the young Bilbo (Martin Freeman) agrees to join the quest, a rather surprising forty minutes has passed. This sequence risks interminability, but Jackson takes advantage of the time to introduce the thirteen dwarves and give them some character traits missing from the source material. James Nesbitt's Bifur in the somewhat cynical joker of the pack, whilst Fili and Kili are the over-eager young guns out to impress their older peers. Dwalin is the bruiser and Balin the wise old - and somewhat pedantic - sage of the group (Ken Stott is excellent in the role). Bombur is fat and little more than that. The real impact is made at this stage by Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. Armitage is charismatic and has steely resolve and presence in his role, and is the standout performance of the movie (and, dare I say it, impresses more than even Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn in the original trilogy).

As well as showing the Necromancer stuff on-screen, Jackson has made some other changes to the story to increase the dramatic weight of events. Thorin now has his own nemesis, a mighty orcish warrior whose arm he cut off in battle. This warrior, long-thought dead, has returned and is now chasing down Thorin and his band (a bit like Lurtz in the movie version of Fellowship of the Ring, but a lot smarter and more continuously present). It's another change that I think some won't like, but as a dramatic device it worked fairly well at introducing some tension to the film. However, what was really distracting is that this orc has the exact same skin tone and texture as the Engineers in Prometheus and is likewise gigantic. His story arc is left unfinished at the end of the film, so we can assume he will return in the sequel (rather cleverly, as it provides a potentially better way of explaining a subplot in that film than Tolkien was able to do in the book).

Elsewhere the film feels a lack of cohesion: the Necromancer plot has little to do immediately with Thorin's quest, so every time we cut away to Radagast the Brown (a great performance by the ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy) trying to resuscitate hedgehogs (!) or Gandalf discussing backplot with Saruman and Galadriel for what feel like nineteen hours, the movie flags. In fact, the dwarves get so bored of Rivendell (missed opportunity: someone saying, ""On second thoughts, let's not go to Rivendell. 'Tis a silly place,"") they just up and randomly leave. Once the dwarves are back on the road together and causing mayhem, the film perks up and more fun is had, even if sometimes accompanied by some unconvincing CGI.

The scenes in the goblin caves in the Misty Mountains are entertaining, but also daft. Barrie Humphries as the Goblin King works rather better than most were likely expecting (and there's a humourous nod to Gandalf's ""You shall not pass!"" moment from the original trilogy), but the extended battle-and-escape sequence is too slapstick to really present much tension. This contrasts to the successful scene where Bilbo meets Gollum (Andy Serkis, on fire as always) and acquires the Ring, which is brilliantly acted by both parties and features some nice tonal variations from comedy to menace and back again.

Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (***) can be called a qualified success. It has some big problems that Jackson has not been able to overcome: the storyline is too slight to sustain three hours and even with the addition of extra storylines and characters, there are some scenes which feel like wheel-spinning for the sake of it (most notably at Rivendell). There is also a near-omnipresent use of CGI in almost every scene of the movie. The original trilogy worked best when the camera was allowed to film natural landscapes or when miniatures were used to depict locations and give them a sense of reality and weight. Here, CGI is much more freely employed, often with less regard for hiding the fact it is CGI. In particular, there is a dearth of truly awesome shots of the countryside of New Zealand in all its glory compared to the original trilogy: here, even many of the landscape shots have been bathed in CGI until they glow with lens-flare. Even in 2D and at 24fps, the film has a 'faker' sheen across it than the original films, which sometimes distracts.

Fortunately, Peter Jackson has learned from the mistakes of George Lucas and has remembered to include plenty of character moments to keep things more real. Armitage is awesome, as previously mentioned, but it's Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo which anchors the movie. His character arc (and Thorin's, which develops in tandem) is well-handled and Freeman nails this icon in a way he didn't manage with Arthur Dent (in the disappointing Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie). These character and thematic moments are less-successfully handled than in the original trilogy, but still give the film some dramatic weight and tension that keeps things interesting.",1376265600,4,6920,4.844463229078614

The Dwarves are snarky bunch but what seems to missing, to me, is chemistry.  It didn't seem to work on screen and parts were a struggle to watch.  However, Jackson does a good job at keeping up the intensity of the movie.

If you're a Jackson fan and a J.R. Tolkein fan, there is no doubt that you are going to love it.  I like Tolkein, but not fanatically and that may altar my perception of this this film.

It starts out as sort of a Hobbit: The Musical and introduces us to the main cast of characters, none of whom really distinguish themselves enough for me to identify their personalities. The adventure has a slow start and never gained enough steam to keep me interested. Even the special effects, which were so seamless in the LOTR trilogy, didn't have the same quality. I have not read Tolkein's The Hobbit, so maybe I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had, but I hadn't read The Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw that adaptation, and was able to love it.

4636089,3,B0059XTU1S,"When Fellowship of the Ring hit the theaters is was like going back in time to the release of Star Wars...the long lines, the shear fascination of imagination gone wild and put on film.  As we go back over those Star Wars adventures now, most us wonder why we stood in line for hours! The first three Star Wars movies are now barely tolerable and the second three are huge disappoints from introducing 'teddy bear' Ewoks to Jar Jar Binks.  So, who are these films aimed at, who is the intended audience?  Is it the film, the story, the characters, an emphasis aimed at some merchandising plan?  In watching Peter Jackson's Hobbit I had that 'star wars' feeling throughout much of the movie. It was the silly introduction of comic relief and an assortment of bad characters.  It's not that the acting left me wanting as much as it was how the characters we scripted and directed.  Disney movies of late have resorted to adding things in movies that are meaningless to the storyline but appeal to a target audience.  It goes without saying that at some point in a Disney today movie, especially animated ones, one or more characters is at some point going to 'pass gas' - I assume for those movie goers who are 10 and under, but then we all have to endure it, just like we did with the Ewoks and Christensen Hayden.  The Hobbit has fallen down the same worn out  'rabbit hole' as most follow-on movies and TV series reach at some point...the wonder in the wonderland of Middle Earth is lost - we've seen it all before...just as Star Wars did...for me.  It in some ways is like seeing the exterior of Star Trek's Enterprise from every possible angle, scene-after-scene, movie-after-movie...ok already. The excitement we all felt with the telling of The Lord of the Rings is like that...the Hobbit cannot reintroduce what we've already seen in every replay we've done of Middle Earth on our home DVD/Blu-ray players and truly believe it can work again as it did a decade ago.  The Hobbit cannot give that back, the Fellowship of the Ring first experience...it just can't happen.  Maybe we have become a more sophisticated audience, more critical when we have to spend our hard earned money on movie going.  We are not seeing these movies for free, there are the actors, the studios, the executives, the sets, etc..to be paid...the profit margin.  I know there is nothing new in that but as an avid movie goer I have come to expect as much from spending my money on movie going as do the movie execs in expecting profits.  The Hobbit lost me in the first fifteen minutes...maybe it's focus on comic relief...maybe bad character development, which in turn puts us in a position where we just don't care about the characters...Bilbo for one!  The way the Hobbit is going, who knows, maybe Jackson will add some teddy bears, a 'Binks-like' irritant, scenes where the characters can 'pass gas' and maybe even a Hayden walk-on...all for the audience right?",1376092800,,2946,4.669245647969052

4636103,3,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson did a great job with the Lord of the Rings, but that same level of wonderfulness didn't work out quite as well for The Hobbit. In brief:

+ If you keep in mind that it's an adaptation of Tolkien's story (or based on his story), then it's a decent story in its own right. But if you think that you're going to watch a movie of the original book, you'll be disappointed at the changes.

+ The parts of the screenplay that were added to stretch this short book into three movies can't compare to the quality of Tolkien's work. They're actually pretty bad, and the discrepancy is rather jolting. They worked too hard to give this movie more ties to LOTR than the original book has, and the story doesn't support it very well. And the great white Orc hunting Thorin is just a stupid addition that doesn't enhance the original story.

+ I don't know whether it was Peter Jackson's decision or Ian McKellen's, but Gandalf mumbles and mutters most of his lines. I couldn't see the point of that.

+ There are several shots that are so over-dramatized that you can only blame it on horrible directing decisions. Two examples are when Thorin turns and faces the camera at the end of Balin's retelling of the battle with the Orcs, and when Gandalf first sees  Galadriel at Rivendell -- it's like she's on some platform that slowly rotates her to face him in an overly dramatic fashion that breaks any realism the movie was trying to sustain. And those aren't the only shots with that kind of problem.

Overall I'd like to give the movie 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon doesn't have half stars, I'll go with just 3. I think they would have ended up with a better movie if they had only planned it in two parts instead of being greedy and trying to stretch it to three.

At first I was a little skeptical about Peter Jackson's 3-movie approach to a book that is just 19 chapters long but at least with ""An Unexpected Journey"" this has allowed him to put a greater level of detail in the movie and not gloss over details that are important to devoted fans.  I wish he had taken the same care with the Lord of the Rings trilogy but that is for another review.  All and all I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.

Despite all the terrific special effects and fine performances, The Hobbit is simply too long winded for its own good. There's probably a decent two hour movie in there, but the theatrical Hobbit is nearly three hours long and the extended apparently a bit longer. Not only am I not the slightest bit interested in an over-overblown extended version of the film, I would pay money for a cut version of about 2 hours. P.S.After just viewing the movie again on the Theatrical Blu Ray, I can allow that there's much entertainment to be had here. But it just drives me nuts to see these ridiculously long and utterly impossible chases where our heroes are bouncing hundreds of feet down off rock faces and such, yet emerge pretty much unscathed at the bottom; I'm thinking mostly of the battling rock monsters and inside the lair of Mountain King Goblin.

1. More of DALE, including the BLACK ARROWS. Director Peter Jackson mentions a previously unseen character: ""Girion, who is defending [the city of] Dale using black arrows against Smaug. And the black arrows play a part in an ongoing story, for they are the one thing that can pierce the dragon's hide.""

2. More king of the wood elves; THRANDUIL. Peter Jackson: ""There are also issues with Thranduil. We get some of the reason why he and the dwarves had a falling out - to do with these white gems...""

3. More of HOBBITON. Producer Phillipa Boyens: ""You are going to get more of Hobbiton. We always wanted to wend our way through Hobbiton, but in the end Bilbo has to run out of the door.""

4. The OLD TOOK'S PARTY: In which we see a younger Gandalf meet Bilbo Baggins as a young child, convincing the wizard of the young hobbit's bravery and courage. I won't spoil it for you, but it involves a dragon and a bit of magic.

5. Dwarf antics at RIVENDELL. Peter Jackson: ""You are going to get some serious Dwarvish disrespect of the elves at Rivendell."" Bofur leads the troupe in a rowdy chorus of ""The Man in the Moon"", a classic Tolkien pub-song.

6. The SONG of the GOBLIN KING. Producer Fran Walsh: ""You are going to get more Goblin Town, and the Great Goblin singing his song. It is a great song, but it was just another delay in terms of moving the story along."" Peter Jackson: ""A number one hit from the Goblin King. Barry Humphries is going to rise up the charts!""

Well, all looking good on these fronts! The roads lead ever on and on...",1375747200,"1,040",1589,4.384353741496598
4636161,2,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson has taken a book which is light, fun and fast-paced, and has made a movie that is enthusiastically imagined but ponderous with additions. These additions betray Jackson's and Fran Walsh's peccadilloes: cutesy characterizations, a love of gross-outs, and an obstinate refusal to rein in any detours in the story.

That refusal is one of the weakest parts of the movie: By hour two I just wanted them to get to the damn Mountain already. I saw no narrative reason for the movie to end where it did, nor to take so long to get there.

More objectionable even than that, however, is the tremendous massacre that Gandalf and the dwarves inflict on the goblins under the Misty Mountains. Yes, the dwarves were taken captive, and their lives were in danger. But, as Gandalf urges them to ""Fight! Fiiiight!"" he and the dwarves start a no-blood-in-evidence bloodbath by decapitating and hacking at the location's established residents. ""Follow me quick!"" is what he says in the book. Rather than curb Tolkien's endemic racism and portrayal of a good-races-vs-bad-races war, Jackson has blown it out of proportion.

While I enjoyed seeing more of Radagast the Brown than Tolkien ever showed, the character inevitably had a Jacksonian flavor. Tolkien's Radagast always seemed like St. Francis to me, but Jackson's -- aside from the cutesiness already mentioned -- has a hatred of spiders and bats that is rather un-Franciscan but right up Jackson's alley.

Then there are the musical numbers. At Bag End, the dwarves burst into a number (""Blunt the Knives"") that had me wondering if this was going to be a Broadway musical. A bit later, they sing a song about their lost home, but that is an important plot moment--when Bilbo first gets the adventuring bug--so I thought it was fine. But when the goblins sing ""Down in the Deep of Goblin Town,"" again, the genre veered toward Broadway musical. But these are the only three songs I remember--somebody correct me if I'm wrong. So the movie seemed rather confused on this score.

Tolkien's book draws Bilbo from his cozy home into a love of adventure by taking him, and us, on a thrilling and ultimately light-hearted ride. By contrast, the movie adds threads of political intrigue, creeping darkness, cruel vengeance, and debates about whether Bilbo should continue his journey -- all of which were more at home in ""The Lord of the Rings."" Add to that the gross-outs (e.g., the goblin-king's huge beard-like goiter), the promiscuous violence, and the somewhat out of place musical numbers, and I'd just as soon wait for all three movies to come out so that someone can edit them together into a two-and-a-half hour movie, which I'd watch instead.",1375660800,4,2697,4.918681318681319
4636162,3,B0059XTU1S,"I thought it was okay, but just really drawn out.  I did not know that it was not going to have an ending and to be continued into a second movie.  To be honest I did not see the whole thing, I fell asleep, but my 11yr old really really liked it.  He has not seen any of the Lord of the Rings yet .",1375660800,,298,3.5538461538461537

4636164,5,B0059XTU1S,"Admittedly, this movie appeals more to men than to women because it is dripping with testosterone and manly things, but if you can enjoy a story that leaves out any romantic relationships, yet surrounds you with a fine cast of characters, then this movie will hold you captive and leave you begging for more. I can scarcely wait for the sequel that debuts around the holiday season. I like movies that give me characters that I would enjoy hanging out with, and the dwarves, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, are just fun and entertaining. I especially respect the way all the dwarves in this flick take care of each others backs and are always stepping up their game for whatever the occasion calls for. Then watching Bilbo transform from a couch potato to a brave life-risking friend and comrade who ascends to heights of heroism that seemed highly unlikely, well, that was like a father watching his son hit a grand-slam to win the game for his team. And by the way; the special effects and scenery are stunning because this was shot in the natural beauty of gorgeous New Zealand. The costumes were nothing short of perfect and the soundtrack was entoxicating, especially the lamenting song that the dwarves sing about their overthrown home which now belongs to Smaug, the dragon calamity that hits hard and ferociously.",1375660800,,1319,4.7894736842105265

4636167,5,B0059XTU1S,"Plot- the hobbit stars Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who has never done anything worth mention so far is his cozy mediocre life. He is a boring soul but that all changes when Gandalf shows up out of the blue. Bilbo is asked to go on an adventure with the dwarves to take back their mountain. (Which was taken from them by smaug the Dragon). The dwarves believe smaug is dead and set off on their quest. Along the way they face a number of twists and turns no one could have seen coming.

Blue ray- leads to the greatest HD picture ever captured on film. The picture's so vivid you can see the sweat on the character's faces! The beautiful scenery of Ireland only adds to the experience, drawing you in through the HD image so clear you don't think it could possibly be more beautiful in person.

The extended edition- is a must for any true fans with amazing new features and footage never before seen! The statue that comes with is a great collectible to add to your collection!

Recommended- I highly recommend the hobbit to any one who liked the lord of the rings or epic adventures in general.

4636238,4,B0059XTU1S,"Ever since ""The Lord of the Rings"" ended, fans have been clamoring for ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted as well.

Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first part of a trilogy of ""Hobbit"" movies. It has some few flaws (enough with the comedy!), but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.

Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...

At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.

It took me two viewings of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd. The second time, I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.

Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of ""The Hobbit"" (plus chunks of ""Unfinished Tales"") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.

And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.

However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.

But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.

And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast.

As for the extended special edition, this only has twelve minutes of new footage -- and since it was a long movie from a duology-turned-trilogy, that isn't surprising. But it will have the vast wealth of extras that we've come to expect from Peter Jackson: ""The Appendices,"" a massive documentary that explores the entire filming of the movie. NINE HOURS OF EXTRAS, including audio commentary from Jackson and Phillipa Boyens.

The comedy can be a bit grating, but ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.",1375315200,14,4370,5.054166666666666

4636267,5,B0059XTU1S,"I had initially given this movie a lower rating.  I have to say that when I saw this film in the theatre, I was underwhelmed as compared to the previous LotR trilogy.  I felt Peter Jackson was over reaching in an attempt to make The Hobbit too much like the earlier movies, and I still maintain that it was an error to deviate so much so from the book.  It was just unnecessary to add a large, ogreish gray orc, Lurtz wannabe.  Having said that, I gave the movie a fresh look, knowing how much I was originally disappointed, and I have to say that it allowed me to appreciate its finer points to a far greater extent.  From the arrival of the dwarves and their mournful ode to the Misty Mountains, to the cave trolls, to the interplay between Bilbo and Gollum and their exchange of riddles, that each of them were truly masterful, and I have been finally wooed.  I now wait with anticipation for part II, and the extended version of an Unexpected Journey coming soon.  Many kind regards Peter Jackson,",1375315200,,1001,4.407608695652174

A bit more time could have been spent developing the individual dwarf characters who add so much interest to the book. I can only imagine what's in store for us when the dragon comes into play. The special effects were good but certain characters took on a ""video game"" look that I didn't care for. Finally, I found the scenes in the goblins' cavern and the last scene with the orcs laughable, if not utterly ridiculous. I understand that this is a fantasy, but unless the dwarves were made of rubber they could never have survived what was done to them in those scenes, not to mention their escaping with nary a broken bone among them.

The amusing bits are there as the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, tries to navigate the new world of adventuring, but the drama of the dwarves plight is a bit too heavily told, as if we, the audience, wouldn't quite catch on to the sadness of the Dwarves plight unless it's dropped upon us like an anvil.  The foreshadowing of the Lord of the Rings is a bit heavy too, though Ian McKellen shows all the coming sorrow of Middle Earth in one beautiful facial expression.

Frodo was so engaging - we shared his awe and wonder at the things he saw and experienced. We suffered through his torments. Bilbo, on the other hand, was so blas that he seemed bored or disinterested. He was annoying and I felt little compassion for him. I don't know if it was the acting, the directing, or a combination of the two, but I felt totally disengaged from this installment. Frankly, I didn't care if Bilbo lived or died, which wasn't how I felt when I read the book.

4636306,4,B0059XTU1S,"I am a Lord of the Rings fan, and loved every minute of the main ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.  I think the first installment of ""The Hobbit"" was a good start to the new ""Trilogy"" of sort-of-prequels.  The story did cover approximately 1/3 of the original book, and I found most of the special effects amusing.  I will say the first half hour or so might be kind of difficult for those not really into this sort of movie.  (Though it might be my favorite part. :-P)
Howard Shore's music is wonderful as usual, and fits well with some of the many themes and sound of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  I also really enjoyed (though again it's not for everyone) The fact they did keep a couple of the Songs from the book in there.  I particularly giggle every time I hear ""That's what Bilbo Baggin's Hates"".
I do have some misgivings about changes and tones they chose to take with this first film in order to set up enough material to span three though.  And I'm very weary of where they'll go with the other two.  For more on that see the last paragraph in ""<>"" Brackets at the end.
I'm not a big fan of 3D movies, so that lead me to get this as opposed to the 3D version.  I actually don't think 3D comes off good enough unless it is paired with the High Frame Rate technology, which I don't think most home theater systems can handle yet.
I also feel I should make a point about the Digital Copy.  I absolutely HATE this version of Digital Copy.  I bought the movie for the movie itself, but the 'UltraViolet' Digital copies are basically worthless to me.  You can't watch it unless you're on a computer or other device that's capable of watching streaming.  I want Digital Copies to watch while on my Gym's treadmills or on the Train, two places my Ipod cannot get Wi-Fi.  I suppose if you're a Streaming Internet Junky who never is without a connection no matter what the cost then it will be fine for you, but otherwise I advise you NOT to count on the Digital Copy.

<<Disclaimer, if you want 0 spoilers then do not read this last paragraph.  For what I'm seeing in the first film: as a Tolkien geek I have serious eyebrow raising about Saruman and Galadriel's appearances as they weren't really in the Hobbit Book.  I think the creation of a sort of ""Main Antagonist"" via Azog the Defiler can be a useful bridge tension between movies, but will be disappointed if they take it too far as he was, again, not in the book.  I'm also not fond of the fact they seem to make the Elves borderline antagonists in this film.  I'd understand that frame of mind for materials they've left for the other two movies and the Mirkwood elves, however the books clearly show Elrond's elves and the stay in Rivendell to be completely pleasant not some grumpy barrier to getting on with the journey.>>",1374969600,,2784,4.3604651162790695

They have as much staying power as the novel! Peter Jackson is an expert at world building and I wish he would lend his talents to other film properties.

4636321,4,B0059XTU1S,"There and Back Again, was one of my favorite books.  Today, There and Back Again, is better known by its abbreviated title The Hobbit.

The Hobbit is a fantasy novel and what many believe and have believed for years to be a children's book by English author J. R. R. Tolkien.  The Hobbit gives introduction to all the nasty, distasteful, distressing, diabolical carnivorous crafty characters that flesh out The Lord of the Rings heroes and villans. The movie, by the same crew who created the spectacular three-part Ring trilogy is entertaining, and definitely for the young until the action begins after the brawl in Bilbo's house as he is making ready to leave the world he knew.  The initial weakness of the movie faded into an enjoyable evening that sent me back to read the original writing of one of the world's greatest story tellers. I will watch it again.",1374624000,2,864,4.74
4636332,2,B0059XTU1S,"Which, of course, is to be expected since The Hobbit was the prequel to the LOR trilogy.

Jackson's film builds on the same type of scenes and direction he used in LOR - but the plot is slow and plodding, interspersed with various fight scenes with mythical creatures, that become increasingly unrealistic, and rather tedious. It feels more like an opportunity to recycle the Lord of the Ring marketing to generate new revenue from The Hobbit, rather than a fresh approach.",1374624000,,473,4.839506172839506

I did not see The Hobbit in the theater, as I was confused as to which way to view it, having read pros and cons on both sides, and not wanting to feel discomfort.

4636335,1,B0059XTU1S,"It's like Jackson is beginning to believe that he wrote the middle earth sagas himself, his brush swings so wide from the original arc. This is probably the worst adaptation I have seen this year. If you boil the problems with this film down to one salient kernel, it would have to be Jackson's misguided urge to take what was a quietly humorous quest and turn it into some kind of Hugh Jackman action film. That is the only reason I can see for Jackson making so many goofy additions to the film, like his dumb sequences of Radagast the Brown driving ... awk! ... a sleigh propelled by RABBITS. Give me a break. Or all of the howling orcs that appear during the original troll sequence, as if the trolls couldn't carry their own weight. Or the appearance of Saruman and Galadriel in Rivendell, when they obviously don't appear until the Fellowship of the Ring. Perhaps Jackson felt that adding these characters to his work would create more continuity ... but that is precisely the problem. Continuity between what? The original works as they were presented by Tolkien were seamless; they did not need additional effects or extra boosts of continuity. The only plausible answer, then, is that Jackson reckoned they would add continuity between his films, and therein lies his arrogance ... or his stupidity. While I liked Jackson's efforts in The Lord of the Rings well enough -- minus the xenophobic racialization of all his monsters, orcs, Haradrim, etc. -- he has clearly become obsessed with his image of himself as some kind of genius whose ""vision"" of a masterwork like Tolkien's justifies any cinematic nuance he sees fit to slam into the script. Unfortunately, so many of these ""additions"" involve scenes that are either hackneyed beyond belief (the dragon opening its eye at the end of the first film) or just completely DUMB (Radagast and his rabbit-mobile) that he has turned his effort at The Hobbit into something as mundane as Iron Man or Catwoman. Maybe even worse.",1374537600,24,1981,4.795321637426901

4636338,3,B0059XTU1S,"I have read and reread ""The Hobbit"" and the LOTR trilogy- they are classics and by far my favorite works of fiction.  I was beyond excited to see this movie.  However, when they brought in Radagast with the bird poop smeared down his face and twitchy ridiculous behavior I was extremely nervous that a treasure of a story was about to be ruined.  There were also instances where the scenes seemed to drag out a little bit too long.  It was almost as if P. Jackson did not turn down any ideas thrown at him- especially in the goblin sequence.  The goblins were made to be almost comical- not scary- and the scene where the dwarves flee the goblin underground was drawn out and annoying.

Fortunately, there are many redeeming aspects of this movie.  ""Riddles in the Dark"" has always been my absolute favorite section of the book, and they nailed it here.  I did regret that they did not show the green glow in Gollum's eyes when he feels suspicion about the ring, but they stayed very true for the most part.  I'm also extremely excited to see how the necromancer storyline plays out- it is referenced in the book, but we never learn more about it.  Gandalf just suddenly abandons the dwarves and hobbit to go drive him out and that is all we know.  I can't wait to actually see this.  I also really enjoyed the additional scenes at Rivendell with Sauron, Galadriel, and Elrond.  It makes sense to feature them since they play such a huge part in the LOTR trilogy.

Overall, it is really well done.  There were just a few snags.  I hope they tweak a few things before the next films come out.",1374451200,3,1591,4.43448275862069

4636375,2,B0059XTU1S,"Firstly, I must record my absolute love of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.  Having been a fan of Tolkien's masterpiece long before hint of the movies ever reached Hollywood, I'm an obnoxious stickler for accuracy when it comes to portrayals of the iconic Middle-Earth, and Jackson remained true to the spirit of the original LOTR epic.  (Yes, I'm one of THOSE Tolkien fans.)  ;-)

...Hey, you write enough academic papers on the subject, and you'll be a stickler, too.

That said, Jackson utterly drops the ball with ""The Hobbit,"" and largely because he is such an excellent film-maker.  (Wait, I'll explain.)  The Lord of the Rings trilogy was meant to be a huge, dramatic, larger-than-life epic, full of heroism and villainy, love and war and passion...  And Jackson delivers.

 ""The Hobbit,"" on the other hand, was meant to be a light-hearted children's tale.  It was ONE story, but Jackson just can't resist the idea of creating another long, drawn-out, nine-hour marathon.  By pulling in useless information from Tolkien's appendices and adding CGI effects ad nauseam, Jackson is trying to create a second Lord of the Rings when there just isn't enough information to work with.

The end result:  a film that is visually stunning but utterly untrue to the original ""there and back again"" spirit of Tolkien's classic tale.  Like George Lucas, Jackson should have left his own legacy alone.",1374364800,4,1405,4.995689655172414

I would really have loved to have seen several more X File motion pictures.  It isn't going to happen because reviewers killed the last one and ""fans"" did not purchase the DVDs.  I never thought this great work would see the light of cinemascope much less 3D. Quit your complaining and buy the DVDs.  Let the money moguls make their greenbacks. The payoff for you is that more dreams come to fruition and we benefit by watching these glorious productions in our home theaters.  If you can't afford them, then that is another matter.  However, you are making an attempt to stop other consumers from purchasing the product which has the same aim a a boycott.

4636393,4,B0059XTU1S,"I am a huge fan of J.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and of Peter Jackson's rendition of these classics on the big screen. Therefore, I had high expectations for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, another movie adaptation of a Tolkien classic --The Hobbit.

The movie was good. The magic of Tolkien's rich story-telling was evident, as was Jackson's spectacular cinematography and special effects. I was captured by the plot and the characters. In particular, Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman were superb in bringing life to the main characters of the wizard Gandalf, and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, respectively. The portrayal of the conflicted hobbit, Gollum, who had been horribly corrupted by the ring, was riveting. The magic of Tolkien's genius in weaving an epic story of good vs. evil was clear. The heroic and the good coming from a most unlikely source--the humble, peace-loving, unassuming Bilbo Baggins--was heartwarming. The villains were villainous and terrifying; their demise a cause for cheering. All these elements were present in this movie, and appreciated.

But as good as The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was, I expected more. There were a few distracting elements, perhaps magnified by the otherwise brilliant storyline and film. But there they were. The buffoonery of the dwarves--major players in this movie--was at times annoying, like a part overplayed. On occasion, the dwarf king Thorin, noble in character and demeanor, seemed almost comically out of place amongst his cohorts and this did not lend itself well to his character or the gravitas that certain segments of the storyline demanded. Then there was the matter of the apparent invulnerability of the good characters. Fearsome evil characters expired, seemingly by the thousands, and some evidently by the mere flick of a wrist by one of our heroes. But not so the good guys! They survived catastrophic collapses of mountains and falls from spectacular heights...only to brush themselves off and continue on with nary a scratch to show for it. Again, where this element appears, the necessary gravitas of the plot is compromised.

But perhaps I protest too much. The movie was a fair rendition of the book, and the book is a classic. Good acting is to be celebrated, as is the visual treat that the movie provides. I was entertained and uplifted by watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I can recommend it as time well spent. Just don't expect it to be quite the lofty experience you get from reading the book or the one you had in watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy.",1374278400,,2585,5.035046728971962

His vision is so all encompassing and strong that it is always a joy to return.
Comparing ""The Hobbit"" to ""The Lord of the Rings"" his touch is a little more goofy and almost slapstick at times.

trees filled with dwarves falling down and that sort of thing.
But hey, it's still Middle Earth and a delight to be there.  If you liked ""Lord of the Rings"" you know you are going to watch it.
I know many who were disappointed because of what I said above, but I obviously was not.

4636483,1,B0059XTU1S,"I was (overall) happy with TLOTR and suspected due to its popularity that they would give us a live version of the hobbit. As a Tolkien/Jackson fan I was ready to spend more money and enjoy ""The Hobbit"". Then I began to hear rumors that it was going to be another trilogy and I thought there was 'no way' they could stretch this book into three movies. When I read about how they were going to do it (pulling other material from other sources to 'fill in the blanks'), I began to get nervous.
This book is not about Smaug, 'the hobbit', not about Gandalf, 'the hobbit', not about the Necromancer, 'the hobbit', not about Thorin, 'the hobbit', not about anything else but THE HOBBIT. The ring is such a very small part of this story that its amazing TLOTR was written at all! All of you who remember the book also remember that there is NO part of the book that doesn't involve Bilbo. We don't witness the death of Smaug, we're only TOLD about it when Bard tells Bilbo that the thrush delivered his message. We don't witness the battle of five armies because Bilbo in unconscious during the battle.
There is so much material about Middle Earth that WB could have probably given us another 6+ movies in a ""tales from middle earth"" type format. There was no need to try and smash all these other stories under this one title.
The movie slashes from one story to another and its confusing even to those of us familiar with the background events they have added to this adventure. The characters themselves are so different from the book that if different names had been used I doubt we would even recognize them.
The (mostly) amazing CGI work done in TLOTR makes this product seem childish by comparison. The wholly ridiculous ride on the stone giants knee (ah 3D doesn't make it any better), the dumb looking trolls and Goblin (orc) King. Along with the Disney type escape on the rail cart from the goblin (orc) tunnels. <-another part NOT in the book because while they are escaping BILBO is dealing with Gollum. Another small add to that, NOW according to the Jackson/WB version of the tale, Bilbo really did steal the Ring!! In the book he ""finds it"", in TLOTR he ""finds it"", only to realize later that the ring was Gollums. In this version he WATCHes the Ring fall out of Gollums pocket and STEALS it.
Another major fault to this movie is how obvious it was rushed to the Big screen. Say what you want about the LOTR release, no one can say the battle scenes small and large were not spectacular. In this movie you wonder whether any battle choreography was done at all! From the battle with the trolls to the tunnel escape we have our adventurers swinging their axes and swords this way and that with no reason (until CGI ""THROWS"" an orc into the picture to receive the blow, or the Troll says ouch and then continues on as if nothing happens).
I have mentioned only a couple of items where our WB/Jackson team totally ignore the original tale. If I were to write about all of them this review would be just as long as this very bad rendition of Tolkien's ""CLASSIC""!! CLASSIC!! Guys!! This is a CLASSIC! How DARE you think you can do a better job of presenting this story than Tolkien! I always understand and have no problem with 'editing' and changing the story a bit to bring a classic to the big screen. But way to many of your changes were unnecessary and RUIN the story. And I mean RUIN it.
I truly believe if Tolkien were alive today, he would have enjoyed TLOTR release. He would have understood the changes that were made as the tale was brought to the screen. And just as sure as I am that he would have liked TLOTR, I am just as sure that he would NOT have like what they have done to this book. In almost every case the was just no NEED to change the story as much as they have.
If you really love ""The Hobbit"", I suggest you watch the animated 'made for TV' version from the 70's. Give this one a miss! Its NOT ""the Hobbit"".
Icing on the cake? Because of this fiasco, its highly unlikely we will EVER see another live version of this wonderful novel. 20+ years before its even considered probably. I won't get to see it (to old).

While some of the actors and sets have changed, it's really the exact same thing as any of The Lord of The Rings movies.  Which if you like those, you'll like these.  I happen to think they're pompous, way too long and boring.  I can't stress boring enough.  There needs to be solid character development in a movie, and I just don't like these characters.  That's not to say that Ian McKellan or Martin Freeman or most of the others give a bad performance, I just don't care about Hobbits and Dwarves and Orc's enough to get in to these films.  My wife loves the books and while they were ground breaking (back in the day) I just never got into them.
In this installment it's the back story of Bilbo Baggins and how he came into possession of the one ring.  We see Gollum again, as well as a few other familiar faces (the Elves and some of the Dwarves).  Once again a faction of the races set off on an adventure to save Middle Earth from a problem.  In this case it's to reclaim the Dwarves homeland after a particularly nasty dragon decides to take over their realm and horde the gold.

4636533,5,B0059XTU1S,"The bar was set pretty high with the original LOTR trilogy, and I'll admit I didn't think this film was going to reach those previous levels, but I have to say I was completely blown away within the first couple of minutes of watching this.  Now some people will complain this film is too long, some will say there is no reason for this one book to be split up into an entire trilogy of films, but I'll just say that I appreciate everything Peter Jackson is doing.  When you have 13 dwarves, and countless other characters and enemies to introduce and explore, and multiple plot points and stories to tell, it's pretty difficult to cover it all in one 3 hour film, which is why I think Jackson decided to expand it into three films (well that and I'm sure money had something to do with it too).  I enjoyed how the movie took its time in the beginning and didn't rush right into any battles or chase sequences...there's nothing wrong with making the audience wait a little bit before all the action starts and instead introducing them to some characters and back story, which I think Jackson did a pretty good job at here.

While I do recommend to most people that waiting for the Extended Edition of this film to hit Blu-Ray in November (or sometime in the Fall) is the smart thing to do, I just loved this film so much that I couldn't wait that long to watch this again in hi-def, so I figured why not just buy this version (the 5-disc 3D version that is) now, and then later on in the year when the EE comes out, buy that and give this one away to my sister or a friend or someone.  Spending $25 for a ""stop gap"" version of this film isn't that a big of a deal to me, especially since I find this adaption so great and wonderful that I plan on watching it again and again until the EE comes out, which then I'll just rinse and repeat all over again, but with that version instead.",1373155200,,1883,4.248603351955308

I've read the book multiple times, seen the animated features a bunch of times, seen this as a play, and listened to the radio drama until I burned out my cassette player, so I am heavily vested in the story.

I started the movie and was taken back to when I was 7 and listening to the story every day with the opening narration: ""In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit"".  I watched this wide eyed and slack jawed for the entire movie, all of my doubts washed away.  The scenery is beautiful, the acting superb, and the music epic.

The only compliant I would have  is the orcs didn't sing and taunt the dwarves in the fir trees, one of my favorite parts of the book, along with their howls of disappointment when the eagles rescue them.

On the other hand, this is a stupid movie that involves a lot of senseless action and overuse of animation.  The acting is good and the animation is impressive but the movie doesn't hang together as a whole and sucks overall.  If you've actually read the book, you'll hate this movie because it completely butchers the plot (and not for the better either).  Certain characters are made into jokes for comic relief.  It was bad enough when they did this to Gimli in a few scenes of LOTR (one of the few flaws in LOTR) but this is much much worse than that.",1372636800,2,672,4.25984251968504

All the seriousness of the Lord of the Rings seems to have left some of the actors who were in the LOTR movies and this one. Lord Elrond as well.. (Gandalf: ""I'm not quite dressed for dinner."", Elrond: ""You never are?"") I didn't find the attempts at humor to be very humorous. I thought Cate Blanchett was excellent as always. The pacing of the film was a bit slow and disjointed. Too much digital work. The king of the Goblins and Azog were disappointingly full CGI. I feel we lose quite a bit in this translation. I like a fantasy film to be a bit darker more ominous.. to have a sense of doubt and wonder at the world. To see the magic and landscapes that make your mind soar. I didn't feel this movie had that. The rock giants fighting to me was quite boring and looked more like a ride at Islands of adventure theme parks. I thought Bilbo was ""OK"". I thought Richard Armitage's performance of Thorin was one of the bright spots. I enjoyed the dwarves quite a bit in this film. I also enjoyed seeing Hobbiton again and frodo. I hope the next installment is better paced and the actors take it a bit more seriously.

However, since Einstein's relativity won't cooperate and there is a limit to computer enhancement of an aged actor, I looked for any sign of depth that was, by design, missing from Bilbo.  I found it at the very end of the movie, when Bilbo says he wants to help the Dwarves regain the home and hearth he himself was so reluctant to leave, reluctant because he had it.  They didn't, and everyone deserves a home.  Perhaps, more than anything, this is why Jackson decided to make three movies out of such a short story.  I can't wait for the other two because, my little issue with Freeman notwithstanding, the production, cinematography, acting, and the 3D effects were all amazing.

4636581,1,B0059XTU1S,"First off, this review is solely about the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy product.  If you want a movie review, there are plenty of others to look at, but this is not the place. My aim is simply to review the product you would be purchasing, and not the movie itself.

For anyone who intends to purchase this Blu-Ray with the intention of utilizing the ""added value"" of the UltraViolet digital copy for online streaming on your computer or other digital device, don't.  Simply do not.  In fact, it's probably a good idea to never purchase digital copy via UltraViolet ever, full stop.  Save yourself the trouble, these really aren't the droids you're looking for (hemorrhoids is more like it).  If you'd like to understand my reasoning, by all means, continue with this review and you will have a full account of why I gave The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Two Disk Special Edition  (DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) a single star (I'd give it none if I could).

OK, so here's how it went down.  I initially contacted UltraViolet/Flixster (you need to sign up for two separate services, that are linked, but somehow different, but equally faulty) regarding my disappointment that I'd have to be tied into their ecosystem without choice, but I was reminded that ""iTunes is not compatible.""  Yeah, it's available in iTunes, you mean it's not a service Warner Brothers/ NewLine Cinema wish to cede market share to.  Great, I get that, hope you have an equally easy to use service...

Sorry, not in the cards.  After voicing my initial disappointment to hear that ""most movies are now going this way because of DRM,"" I begrudgingly signed up for the Flixster/UltraViolet account, only I didn't, or I did and didn't, sort of.  I typed in the digital copy code from the card enclosed within the Blu-Ray/DVD case and was prompted to enter my account information.  I successfully created a new account, and was given an offer to add 5 free DVD's to my Flixster account by downloading their app (hey, might as well add a few others if I'm ever going to use the service at all, right?)  So I go ahead and download the crapware and try and log in.  No dice.  Was my password wrong or can I not be logged into the app and the website at the same time? I tried logging out just to be sure.  Still no luck with the password, I tried to log back in on the website.  Password invalid?  OK, click ""forgot password,"" a new password is sent to my email.  I try to use it and it doesn't work.  Curious about UltraViolet side of the operation, I go to the UltraViolet website, type in my email and plug in the password, and Bingo!

OK, so I'm logged in and go to account to change my password, I change it, and an emailed confirmation is sent to my address.  OK, now we're getting somewhere.  So I'm curious about how UltraViolet differs from Flixster, and decide to check my library, glad to see that Flixster was at least able to successfully talk to UltraViolet, even if I couldn't log in to Flixter yet.  Then this is where things got weird.  I noticed that the movie wasn't actually the Hobbit, but the movie Pay It Forward.  Wut? O.o

No really, I clearly saw The Hobbit indicated when I typed in the digital copy code, and it showed my name under the library when I first created the account, so what happened?  Well, I tried logging into Flixster one more time, and, bizarrely, it stated that I successfully signed in with Facebook.  What, what???  I didn't authorize my Facebook account to sign in, and yet it clearly did it anyway.  Suddenly, the website wants to access my personal info and email address (which, har har, they already should have).

I go to facebook, check and sure enough, the Flixster facebook app was added to my very short list without my authorization (I don't even know how that happens).  I promptly deleted the app from my facebook account, went back to the website, and noticed that The Hobbit was in fact gone from the library, only to be replaced with the saccharine and slightly constipated faces of Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, and Haley Joel Osment. At this point, I'm over it, I'm through with the whole thing, and, notably, I still can't sign in to Flixter with the regular password.  Sorry, but no thanks.  This is a friggin' nightmare that I don't ever want to relive, so what's the point of bothering and wasting my time trying to play along.  Next time, I'll think twice about Blu-Ray and, sadly, probably buy through an ecosystem that is easy to use, works and is reliable (iTunes).

Really a bummer, but then this review should have been about a movie, or maybe even the Blu-Ray quality, sound, extra features, etc.  Instead, you got this pathetic tirade from someone who's just completely fed up with trying to navigate through the fragmented landscape of DRM control.  I can now honestly understand why some people turn to pirating, and that's just being honest.  I never did get those ""5 free movies"" through their DVD to digital program, I think I'll just have to resort to converting my DVDs using software and uploading to a private online storage and streaming that way.  I hate to do it, mostly because it's a hassle, and not my preferred approach, but they've honestly left me no choice.  Sorry Peter Jackson and everyone who was actually involved in creating this movie, but the distribution side of your industry really sucks and is undermining my interest in the quality of hard copy, and is forcing me to adopt a different standard to keep up with the trends in technology.  This upsets me deeply.

By the way, the Blu-Ray disc was fine, it came in the box as promised, played fine in my player, and never showed a hint of anything remotely resembling Haley Joel Osment.  I will, however, never be purchasing another Blu-Ray that exclusively offers the joke that is UltraViolet digital copy ever again.",1372550400,2,5835,4.608527131782946
4636582,5,B0059XTU1S,"I'm a huge movie fan, but I've just started watching 3D movies.  The problem with 3D movies, of course, is that 3D is not suitable for every kind of movie; others can be greatly enhanced by it.  My tv requires the active type glasses, so I can't speak for other types of 3D experiences using other types of televisions that use only passive glasses, but I can tell you that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has been the best television 3D movie experience I've had so far.  I also own a few other titles such as Avatar, The Avengers and The Life of Pi.  The Hobbit seems as if it was actually filmed with 3D in mind.  There are fun scenes where you have birds and other flying creatures appearing to fly right in your face.  Very cool.  There's a lot of that in The Life of Pi as well, which is also a great movie to watch in 3D.  Avatar, surprisingly, has been the weakest movie of those that I own as far as 3D goes.  While The Hobbit... as a movie is not necessarily the greatest, the 3D aspect of it made it a very entertaining and fun experience.  Highly recommended.",1372464000,,1073,4.241379310344827

I enjoyed watching The Hobbit, however I think he missed the mark a bit with his interpretation.  The casting is good - although I definitely pictured the dwarves as -- well, a bit more like Gimli in Lord of the Rings.  These dwarves are too cute - and who knew they were Irish?  The thing I remember about reading The Hobbit as a child is that it was innocent.  The adventures were not as dark as Lord of the Rings.  The danger was really the Dragon - and the dark power that was rising was not really dealt with in The Hobbit.  This movie, in my opinion, misses the mark there.  Jackson is trying to set the stage for the darker tale to follow, and inserts too many things into the movie that were not in the book.  I also think it's a mistake to make this sttttrrrreeeettttcccchhh out into 3 movies.",1372291200,,909,4.2748538011695905

Basically, Peter Jackson brings back most of the cast of Lord of the Rings, and does little else that is new with them all. Even the hawks saving the day at the end is a dead copy of what came before.

There are too many dwarves to keep track of.

Bilbo Baggins has nothing like the task of Frodo the ring bearer. His grand arc is to discover the bravery within.

Maybe it is me but seems like an another not so epic journey that fails to keep my interest.  3D didn't really add much over standard blu ray in my opinion.  I think they just keep cranking out these movie franchises and they get ho hum after a while.  Our under rated lovable hobbit defies the odds...blah blah blah.,1371772800,,417,4.036585365853658

In all I think the film retelling of this classic tale only adds more depth to the story.  I know Mr. Jackson could have gone the safe route and made the movie line for line from the book.  I know that some purists may wish that he had.  But I sat enthralled for the duration with no complaints at the end.  Looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug!",1371686400,,523,4.242424242424242

Along with essential elements of the famous children's story, Jackson introduces a few of the darker, deeper themes which make it a true prequel to the epic tale that will soon become The Lord of the Rings.

4636666,3,B0059XTU1S,"Just my opinion, however, this felt like a good story stretched out too much.  I was just getting into the story when the movie was over. because of this, I'll probably not be watching the next movie in the series.  I'll probably just read the book.",1371686400,,249,4.391304347826087
4636667,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let me get this out of my system first. Tyrion who? Thorin is the KING. Well, now that's out, I have to say I love this movie. And I love it for the very same reasons others might hate it.

First, it's the first third of the Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It's not the whole story, was not advertised as such, and people who complain it's incomplete amaze me: they need to read a description first, or maybe a press release, and know what to expect.

Second, of course it seems like a precursor to the real happenings, because it is. This is just the first part of Bilbo's journey, and despite his fervent hope it's the worst, it is not, by far. That's the key - the story is to be continued, and this movie does not work that well as a stand-alone, but I can absolutely live with that. And will eagerly await the sequel.

Thirdly, at first I was bewildered when I saw clear parallels between the Hobbit and Lord of the Ring movies (there was a scene where, if you don't look too closely, the dwarves and Bilbo would pass for the Fellowship, traversing the magnificent wilds of Middle-earth). It seemed a stretch, seeing this group of bumbling characters in such epic settings. They seemed so out of place, at first I thought Peter Jackson tried to make an epic out of a fairy-tale, and failed miserably. Then halfway through the movie it dawned on me: the characters might be a bit bumbling, but they do inhabit the same epic land named Middle-earth. And ready or not, they will have to find their way in it, find their way home. As soon as I understood this, the jarring feeling of out-of-placeness faded, and I was able to enjoy the journey.

And fourth, the characters themselves. Bilbo is yet to come into his prime (I though he was getting there by the end, with the Gollum scene and especially with orc confrontation), and the wizard/elf/necromancer politics are a bit out there yet, but the interactions between the dwarves and their characterization are superb. I absolutely love Fili and Kili, and let me say this, I could call Thorin my king.

So, to conclude, ignore the nay-sayers, watch the movie, and judge for yourself.",1371600000,,2130,4.507772020725389
4636668,5,B0059XTU1S,I liked this movie because I have seen all of the lord of the rings. This movie is a definate  precursor and gives more depth to the other movies. I will like collect the whole series.,1371600000,,184,4.111111111111111

Obviously, I was pretty disappointed when the movie suddenly ended with them staring at a far off view of the mountain.  For a first installment, the movie was pretty good though. Just like in The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson seems to have lifted scenes right out of my imagination from when I read the books when I was younger.  Its pretty cool to see your imagination played out for you on a movie screen.  I don't think the movie had the same epic feel as The Lord of the Rings but the series is going to be good if it keeps on the same way it started.  As far as my experience watching it on Amazon, there was only one hiccup when I had to start the movie over and fast forward to the part where it locked up.

I read this and The Lord of the Rings when I was 12 and recovering from a broken leg.  The books have been replaced twice and reread many times since.  Next step is to add to my Kindle library.
Now I expected the movie to be different than the book and accept the creative differences needed to put the book on the ""big screen"" so I am not disappointed.  It was well done and I cannot wait for the next installment.
Love how the dwarf characters have been represented. Glad to see Gandalf again.  Bilbo was a little different and I did have a hard time getting use to him but he was still likable which is important.

What I like about this package is that you get the 3D and 2D versions both in blu-ray, so if you don't have a 3D system, you can still watch it in glorious HD until you can buy the other.
The 3D version comes in two discs (like ""The Lord of the Rings""), while the flat version is only in one, which is great because you don't have to be switching discs to watch the whole movie.

4636711,5,B0059XTU1S,"I admit to being some of the many who were not a fan of the 48 frames per minute style in which it was shot.  P Jackson nailed his directing style in LOTR and I wish he had kept to that. I also felt the movie could have been shorter by about 20-30 minutes.  And this is coming from someone who loves long movies.  This one however, I felt the length of it.  I wish that they had stopped the movie after Bilbo escaped Gollum and they got out of the mountain.  They could have had their moment of closure still that way.  But that's just my opinion, and I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ALL.  I loved Bilbo tho, for he is a light and stronger hero to me than Frodo (no offense to Frodo) but Bilbo just seemed to have more gusto.  I liked the dwarves as well, and I actually liked seeing Radagast the Brown, for I missed not seeing him in LOTR.  Many may not remember that he made a brief cameo in Fellowship of the Ring.  I hope this series does something with Glorfindel the elf, because I also missed him in LOTR movie as well.  Gandalf was great too, and I will admit to also liking the stone giants moment.

Overall, this is still very much worth watching.  The mistakes that I saw with the film do not stop me from enjoying it because I loved the book and am happy to see it brought to dramatization.",1371340800,,1289,4.067460317460317

4636715,5,B0059XTU1S,I read the Hobbit like most everyone else.  The hobbit was a small book that moved along rapidly through the story.  It glossed over most of the stuff in the movie in a single line where the movie goes on and on and on and on to flesh out those smaller details.  It's more like The Hobbit timeline from the perspective of Middle Earth rather than The Hobbit we all read.  It's better that way - you get the sense of how The Hobbit is related to The Lord of the Rings without having to read The Silmarillion.  For anyone who says - it's nothing like the book - it's true.  I loved the length and the detail of the movie. It might be better to watch it over two days though.,1371340800,,672,4.053030303030303

The story starts in The Shire with Bilbo Baggins & Frodo Baggins discussing Bilbo's Adventure.  Then it goes to Bilbo joing a party of Dwarves on a quest to go east.

The story was far more engaging and suspenseful than the movie. The acting is good, the makeup and costumes are great, the scenery is absolutely beautiful although the transition is sometimes disjointed from one scene to the next because they were filmed in different parts of New Zealand. The bad news is that the CGI fight sequences are way over the top and have no credibility. The fight between the Stone Giants and the excape was far to fanciful and tiring to watch. The whole sequence should have been replaced by a much shorter and more believable event. The dwarves excape from the thousands of orcs under the mountain was also way over the top. Other viewers have described it as looking like a video game. Again this sequence should have been trimmed and the flight of the dwarvs from the orcs should have been presented with, at least, some credibile elements.

I see no justification for make the Hobbit a trilogy if only to allow for long sequences of run-away, over the top CGI battles.",1370995200,,1168,4.669902912621359

4636755,2,B0059XTU1S,"I'm having difficulty sitting through these recent Peter Jackson films.  Maybe I should just skip the rest, but virtually every one of them is tauted as one of the greatest films of all time, so my curiosity gets the best of me.  In terms of positives, ""The Hobbit"" has a good lead actor (Martin Freeman) and the opening 30 minutes are engaging, but much of the rest of the film drags.  There are a few decent (albeit short) fights during the middle (with a few longer fights near the end), but there are too many side plots and too much filler material to slug through.  The script is unfocused and unengaging.

I think one of Peter Jackson's big problems is his failure to set-up intermediate goals for the protagonists.  Instead, he sets up a long-term goal and has the protagonists walk around for 6 hours while they fend off random attacks.  This creates a monotonous, dull framework that cripples the enjoyability of the film.

Compare this to Clash of the Titans (1981), which laid out a series of fascinating obstacles that were accomplished throughout the course of one 2-hour film:

-capturing and taming Pegasus
-seeking the blind Stygian witches and coercing information out of them
-venturing to the Gorgon island and defeating the canine guardian Dioskilos
-entering Medusa's lair, defeating her, and retrieving her head
-defeating Calibos and his giant scorpions
-facing the Kraken

I think Clash of the Titans is a true epic adventure because the long-term goal requires a plethora of intermediate accomplishments. They're not just arbitrary dangers that the protagonists encounter along the way. Many of these goals are necessary steps that must be taken in order to achieve the final long-term goal. When all is said and done, I can look back and admire the difficulty and complexity of the journey. Each individual success becomes a memorable event.

Such is not the case with The Hobbit, which basically has the protagonists walk around and fight villains without any interesting identifiable purpose other than reaching the dragon's lair - an event that will likely occur in the 6th hour of the trilogy (if we're lucky!). It just feels like a series of meaningless clashes that become conflicts because the protagonists were not lucky enough to avoid them along the way to reaching their long-term goal. The obstacles feel arbitrary and there's no anticipation or build-up to any of them. There's no sense of accomplishment to the protagonists' actions.

The action choreography is not impressive enough to make up for any of the flaws.  The escape thru the lair of the Ballsack Chin King is pretty good, but a bit too tension-less.  Gollum shows up and is annoying as usual.  Gandalf uses the same three tricks that he used in LOTR.  Can Peter Jackson please give us a few cool magic spells for a change?

Seems like their target audience was children and adults with below-average intelligence but that is par for the course now with movies.  With the laughable rabbit sled and childish guffaws it made me think of Episode I.  The analogy is pretty strong - popular trilogy followed by another trilogy ""prequel.""

4636763,5,B0059XTU1S,"I loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and kept my high hopes for this film down. Fortunately, I was not disappointed. The visual effects are great, and while they may not have quite the same WOW effect as LoTR did, it still adds to that same universe and is quite enjoyable. Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood and Hugo Weaving all make great return performances and Martin Freeman is a welcome addition to the crew. The dwarves were all fun, except really only a few are highlighted (mainly Thorin, Balin and Bofur) and the rest are rarely seen or heard. Also, another great pro to this film is the MUSIC. Howard Shore strikes again with a wonderful, lush, score that really adds to the Hobbit as a movie.

Personally I can't WAIT for Movie #2, purely for the animation and voice (Benedict Cumberbatch!) for SMAUG!",1370908800,,828,4.594594594594595
4636764,3,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the latest attempt by Peter Jackson to cash in on his notoriety for 'The Lord of The Rings', and is, IMO the weakest of the Tolkien books that he has directed.

The movie starts out in the LOTR universe with an older Bilbo working on his story, after Frodo leaves to wait for Gandalf to come for Bilbo's party, thus starting the viewer out in the future, to then go back and recount Bilbo's past. And it is here where the movie then drags, going slowing from the meeting of the dwarfs, to Bilbo's first encounter with trolls/orcs, to their coming to the elf city of Rivendell.

There are some action sequences, and some good CGI effects, but these are spaced far enough apart that one is almost bored by the time the action commences.

The other major complaint with this movie is the choice that Jackson has made to make a single story, the finding of the ring, into a 3-MOVIE experience, so that at the end of this movie, when you are expecting the confrontation with Smog, the movie ends abruptly, and we are forced to wait for the next ""installment"".

""The Lord of The Rings"" is one of my favorite series of books, and the films for that set, Jackson did justice to, but this time it seems as all that he is doing here is trying to milk hobbit and middle earth fans into paying to see another trilogy. 'The Hobbit' does fit in the middle earth universe, but not in this incomplete state.",1370908800,,1428,4.3977272727272725

4636766,4,B0059XTU1S,"When I heard they were going to span The Hobbit over three movies, my expectations fell for the project.  I enjoyed the movie tremendously, but the longer than long ""battle"" type scenes and repeatedly-just-too-lucky-to-be-true narrow escapes (to annoying degrees) got on my nerves.  Still, well-acted and I look forward to the next one.",1370908800,,336,5.320754716981132

4636769,4,B0059XTU1S,"Enjoyable, of course. It held our attention, despite the length. It seems more detailed than the LOR trilogy movies. I guess that is because they did one movie for each of the LOR book, and this seems it will be three movies for the one, shorter, Hobbit book. I haven't read the book in over 30 years, but there is a lot that I don't remember from the book that is in the movie.

4636782,2,B0059XTU1S,"I have to be honest and say that other than the names of the characters there wasn't much resemblance to the book at all. I realize that there has to be a certain ""movie freedom or artistic license"" involved but Mr. Tolkien must be turning over in his grave. Characters and sub-plots introduced just to ""flesh out"" the material as a trilogy, you gotta' be kidding! Another point was the humor, in the first three movies the humor was quite well done, the humor in ""The Hobbit"" is so off base it's almost criminal. Just awful. I was quite disappointed overall, the only thing about the movie that was well done was the ""filming"" itself. I'd heard nothing but bad about  filming ""The Hobbit"" in 48 fps... it was just a crisp and clean movie to watch, it was just too bad that the movie itself could not live up to the transfer itself!",1370736000,4,832,4.402597402597403

Of course, given the success, had been allowed to make up a bit 'in the extended versions of the DVD (including the spectacular new pieces musical's accompaniment composed ad hoc) but many of the characters and scenes dear to the readers of Tolkien, however, were left out from the movies.

With ""The Hobbit"", transformed from a little book for children in a new great new trilogy, Jackson not only tells so well pretty much everything but even managed to add some pieces!
And this without overloading the plot and the freshness of the original text!
Of course, much of the credit for the success of these films is due to the actors and the exceptional team of collaborators that Jackson has gathered around him but just the way that he led them makes him a great director and a great example of management.

I mean they when to moria and got captured by goblins then escape. they fight for about 5min and Bilbo says like he is just the best warrior ever ""I will help you get your home back"". ok very boring plot, then for the so called special effects that everybody and there mother was saying where amazing. no thy where not because they really didn't do anything that need special effects and besides that I personally think that the original trilogy was a thousand times better than this because when they did use special effects it helped move the plot not show off how awesome the tech crews where because they could make them. in short I will not be getting nor seeing anymore in this  trilogy and still don't get why it grossed over a billion dollars",1370563200,,1227,4.405286343612334

4636832,2,B0059XTU1S,"I've been a long time fan of The J.R.R. Tolkien, TLOTR, and The Hobbit. Not role playing, conventions, or any of that tripe. I've appreciated his writing style, story lines, characters, and the remarkable creation of an alternate world with its own languages. I know the books well and even sent Tolkien a letter to tell him how much I'd appreciated his work. That was back in the 60s when I was in high school. He even responded in 1965 with a personal, signed note on his stationary that I still have framed and on the wall. All that by way of establishing that I have some appreciation for the original. The 3 movies that covered The Lord of the Rings trilogy were good, entertaining films that showed some respect for the books. The Hobbit is hardly recognizable - other than the presence of hobbits as characters on the screen. It's longer than it ever needed to be, borrows lavishly from bits and pieces from Tolkien's The Silmarillion (kind of a grab bag of Middle Earth prehistory and undeveloped story lines - all clumped into a near unreadable tome). If you're completely unfamiliar with The Hobbit, you might find some special effects entertaining. Otherwise, you'll likely be very disappointed. And to think that this director is going to milk the modestly sized Hobbit (shorter than one of the three volumes in TLOTR) into 3 movies would be laughable if it weren't also sad. I watched this on my Kindle Fire during a 6 hr. flight to the West Coast - and even that boring environment was not enough to keep me interested in the film. The Fire, on the other hand, delivered lots of other content to keep me entertained for most of the trip - so it wasn't the delivery mechanism, it was the wretched execution of The Hobbit in video. At most, just rent the film. Even cheaper, watch the trailer about 50 times in a row for free and for equivalent value.",1370390400,,1863,4.564179104477612

4636849,4,B0059XTU1S,"I recently read J. R. R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" to my daughter as a bedtime story, and, as I book that I started reading as a child and put down because I found it boring, I rather enjoyed as an adult.  The story is often considered children's literature, but there is much, much more to Tolkien's story than a simple adventure.  A lot of the humor and social criticism is lost on anyone not old enough to understand what he was trying to say.  And it truly is an excellent story.

With that said, my wife really wanted to go see ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" when it was in the theaters.  However, she was rather pregnant at the time, and we never wound up making the trip.  After convincing her to do a 3-day ""Lord of the Rings"" marathon, she wound up really enjoying the story as well as the individual movies.  Therefore, I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD + UltraViolet edition, and we waited anxiously for it to arrive.  With the story fresh in my memory, I was curious to see how Peter Jackson would take a 200-plus page novel and turn it into a 3-film epic.

Over the years, I've heard many complaints about the liberties taken with ""The Lord of the Rings"" in how the story was told from multiple perspectives.  My response to these complaints was to wave my hand in dismissal and remind the complainer that they have to give some leeway when taking an established novel and interpreting it into film.  Liberties HAVE to be taken; it's almost always how it goes.  With that said, I had a hard time swallowing a lot of what was filmed for ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.""  I may be blowing things out of proportion here, but only about half of what happened in the film was actually in the book.  A LOT of liberties were taken with the making of this film, and I can only imagine how much additional material will be added to the following two films.

Saying that, the film, in and of itself, is an enjoyable experience.  If you're a long-time fan(atic) of the original novel, please accept this film as an ""interpretive dance"" version of the pre-""Lord of the Rings"" universe as a whole.  If you've never read the novel, please, by all means, watch the film.  Just understand that the book, if you decide to read it, is a rather different animal.  And if you have no intention whatsoever in reading the book, chances are you'll love this film, especially if you love the ""Lord of the Rings"" films.

In conclusion, I could have done without all the liberties taken with the story to make this a 3-film epic like ""The Lord of the Rings.""  It was a bit much for me, and, as someone who has minimal background in the world of J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbitverse, I have no clue where it all came from.  My only guess is that these films will be the last Hobbitverse films made, so they're trying to cram in as much material as humanly possible.",1370304000,,2858,4.434865900383142

4636854,1,B0059XTU1S,"I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I really wanted to love this movie--but it was truly horrible.  They changed the story so much that Tolkein's original story is all but lost.

The charm was squeezed completely out of the book.  The movie is one bad car-chase/battle scene/suspense scene after another (scenes that were never in the book!).  There's no sense of discovery or growth.  Not when badass Bilbo kills a warg in the first installment of the series, and Gollum is played for laughs. Sheesh.

I could go on and on about what I hated about this movie, but suffice it to say that my family and I were angry the entire time the movie played.  Things just kept making us mad--we felt personally insulted by all the crap thrown into this movie that just didn't belong.

Peter Jackson clearly doesn't understand or respect the characters--but boy does he love those battle scenes!

Ugh.

Bad music.
Bad editing.
Bad gratuitous 3D shots.
Bad everything.

I'm so disappointed!  I won't waste my time on the next two movies in the series.

4636860,1,B0059XTU1S,"Now, I'll admit off the bat that I have read the Hobbit quite a few times since I was a child and had it read to me quite a few times before I could read.  So yes, I love the book.  For anyone with a similar background, I can confidently say you're best served not watching the film.  Simple as that, read no further.

...that said, I probably differ from a lot of the people who loved the book in that I didn't expect a perfect word for word re-enactment of the book.  I figured it would be have to be different from a logistical standpoint - how do you cram a whole book, or even a third of a book, into a relatively short time for the sake of the movie?

I found myself, not offended by this movie as a lover of the book, but just laughing a lot.  I estimate at least 50% of the events in the film don't happen in the book.  Another 40% is composed of CGI action extrapolated off events that kinda sorta did happen in the book but not really.  The remaining 10% was kind of pleasant I guess.  They got the appearance of some things right.  A few times, they had characters say some of the actual lines from the book, although much less frequently than you'd think.

But it was VERY strange - practically every major event in the book is altered away from what it was and a lot of little things got altered - during the cleaning of the dishes, they omitted ""...so carefully carefully with the plates"" in favor of repeating an earlier part of the song - they didn't save any time with the omission and lost some of the meaning of what was going on. ...or when they finally got around to the opening couple sentences from the book, they changed them.  ""... it was a hobbit hole and that means comfort ...able THINGS""?  And for instance, they made the dwarves oafish, rude, and kind of dumb instead of the exceedingly polite educated highborn fellows they were - which made it more difficult to understand why Bilbo had a hard time turning them away.  So instead of getting to know the dwarves a little bit and perhaps liking them, sympathizing with them, they remain relatively generic and un-likeable, which is why later they have to develop the new subplot of Bilbo's pity for them ""Oh I have a home and you don't"" in place of what worked in the book.  Because otherwise Bilbo's actions don't make sense at all.  The additions, rather than streamlining the book into a film, created more work the authors had to backtrack later to try and repair.  Does Bilbo's sympathy for the dwarves in the last 20 minutes of the film make up for them being made into such unsympathetic characters at the beginning?  The writers end up creating problems that take even longer to solve than it would have to just do the original thing.  This really is a case of short cuts make for long delays.

And of course there's all the extra mind numbing action with all the action cliches - people yelling ""nooooooo!"" in slow-mo happens over and over.  So much $#!% happens so quickly in such an undulating CGI consequence-free unreality, that it takes you out of the story and straight out of the movie.

...so you end up with this film that is bloated with alterations, additions, and CGI action.  You'd figure the additions, at least the action, was there to keep it exciting, but the overall effect is  surprisingly BORING.

I'd heard there was a lot of ""extra stuff"" in the movie and was prepared to give it a chance but wow, just wow.  My point isn't so much ""Hey they diverged from the book,"" but my god, they went to a LOT of trouble to diverge from the book with a bunch of 3rd rate material when using the original stuff would have been EASIER, then dragged in unnecessary stuff from the LOTR to do a number on that too, then added a whole bunch of extra new stuff that was even worse.  It's amazing that, in deciding to alter so much for the sake of making it into a movie, we end up with a 3 hour movie where the majority of the movie wasn't part of the book OR the appendices.

It's as if they wanted to make, idunno, Krull With Rabbit Sleighs but get everyone to buy it by referencing The Hobbit - only to blunder every reference and fail with their new material.

I honestly don't feel that my childhood story was ruined any way - this is so far from the original, I don't recognize it - just embarrassed for the makers of this film.  Standing on its own as a film unconnected with any book, it's a confused, boring, cliched mess.  Guillermo Del Toro I'm embarrassed for more than anyone, although he showed the good sense to leave the project, so maybe, hopefully, he's the least to blame.  He's never produced a lame, boring, cliche-ridden turkey like this before so I'll give him a pass - we'll see in July with Pacific Rim if he's still got the magic or not.

So if you're looking for a fantasy movie, skip this and do, idunno, Krull, Ladyhawke, Legend, Stardust, Princess Bride, Willow, Any of the Harry Potters, the Narias weren't TOO bad I hear, Time Bandits... I guess you could throw in Highlander if you like.  If you want to go the sword and sorcery route and don't mind on-purpose campiness, there's beastmaster and the various conan movies.",1370131200,11,5146,4.375394321766562

4636869,3,B0059XTU1S,"This DVD was purchased from Amazon and given to me as a gift.

In a nearly three-hour film Peter Jackson never gets to the point and ends it abruptly. He plans two more films to finish up the story (and to milk his audiences of a lot of money). He must have an awful lot of left over scenes and special effects to recycle from his Lord of the Rings films. The opening scenes were obviously cut and recycled from Jackson's LOTR films. It was painful and yet funny to see Martin Freeman plod around in furry clown-shoe sized hobbit feet which he obviously was not used to wearing. A few of the dwarves actually looked like dwarves and the others looked like miniature people - but then there was never any comparative scale so you rarely knew what you were actually seeing.

Benedict Cumberbatch was advertised as The Necromancer and he literally has about four seconds of screen time and then only as a fuzzy silhouette. Pretty bad.

The cgi effects were overcooked and overlong. I watched this film with a group of people and halfway through the escape scenes from under the mountain everybody began to laugh and titter because the constant repetitive violence and long-shot special effects were so silly.

Apparently Jackson decided that he could improve on The Hobbit by gutting the story and adding characters and scenes that are irrelevant (and apparently he could make more money by stretching it out this way). One egregious example: Radagast the Brown smoking marijuana and eating hallucinogenic mushrooms? Puhleeeze! Give me a break!

4636873,5,B0059XTU1S,"If, like me, you can't get enough of Tolkien, and if the fine details of of his world interest you as much as the broad story, then you ought to love the Hobbit (Unexpected Journey), which is a microscopic view of the unfolding first third of the tale. It's all done with an obsessive approach to every aspect of the story. Thus, character development is managed with care, but so too are matters like the design of mugs and the hemming on Bilbo's Bermuda sorts. It's all realer-than-real. And that's not a joke. Super high-def technology provides sceen views that work differently from normal human vision. In the real world, we focus with incredible sharpness on a center of interest, and the rest of the visual field is not resolved to that extent; things come into sharpest focus when we look at them. But in the Blu-Ray screen view, the whole wide screen is sharp, and while this is great on the second or eleventh view, because there are always new things to discover, for people who do lots of visual work, the first viewing is freaking weird, antiseptic, and far, far from believable. I don't recommend doing it, because it nearly ruins the movie, but it becomes easy to see the painted, stage-set effects of surface texture, or fabricated and CGI elements in so many scenes. It's gorgeous, and perhaps looks ""real"" to most people, but it sometimes reeks of Jar Jar Binks and the heavy-handed effects in the later Star Wars episodes. The other jarring element of the film, in my opinion, is the decision to treat many of the dwarves as caricatures. There's way too much ""Dopey"" in many of them, in my opinion, and while humor is essential to balance the other emotions of the story, I found this element to be heavy handed, unbelievable, and dumb. On the other hand, the casting and acting of Bilbo is brilliantly done. I highly recommend the film; I just wish the Blu-Ray treatment wasn't so excessive and clinical, and I wish Jackson had avoided the doofus aspects of the dwarves. Well -- one more thing. As with Spielberg's ""Tintin,"" is it really necessary to have endless video-game action sequences? It's like watching NASCAR.",1370044800,,2139,4.706666666666667

I needn't have worried, since this bears so little resemblance to Tolkien that calling it the The Hobbit is just a marketing gimmick. Yes, Bilbo is in there somewhere, and there are dwarves, and they're on their way to the Lonely Mountain. That's about it. A totally gratuitous Hollywood super-villain revenge subplot gets tacked on, Radagast stars as a sort of Ewok clown, the sequence of events is reinvented, there are booger jokes, and more. Basically every obligatory, predictable Hollywood children's fantasy movie trope has been layered on -- so much so, thankfully, that the movie is often unintentionally funny and otherwise pretty much forgettable. Maybe on a big screen the scenery would be cool? I'm stretching here.

The one part of The Hobbit that's done well is the riddle scene. This scene really does convey tension, authenticity, and Gollum's grief at the loss of his Precious.",1369958400,6,989,5.030487804878049

 If you like the LoTR movies you should equally enjoy the Hobbit Ian McKellen is excellent and Martin Freeman is brilliant as a young Bilbo.

This is a problem I have had several times with Flixster/Ultraviolet. And I have contacted Flixster customer support twice about this problem that I can't play a movie offliine.
I have had to delete my movies, delete Flixster, download the program again and then download my movies again.

* This UltraViolet/Fixster is just poorly designed software.
There should have been an iTunes Digital Copy option with this movie.

Neither copy loads on my standard dVD player, or it it does load (eventually), it still won't play.  This is very annoying to only get through the DVD splash screen and into the main menu.  I'm chalking it up to the cost of learning....I can't afford to buy a new DVD player right now.  This one is a Sony, the one in the living room is a Panasonic, and it works on neither of them.

The life and depth this film brings to the different species of middle earth is refreshing... I remember being excited to ""meat"" them. The action scenes where right on the mark. and the humor that is strewn throughout is delightful.

Cons: I definitely felt a sense of dragging out of scenes, to fill in the time... One scene in particular was just unnecessary and completely absurd, it involves the Giants... I watched this movie, knowing it was a two part movie, and i hate those... I even deliberately did not see it in theaters, just because it was a two part movie, and the second part would not be out for another year. but they did end this first part, leaving you wanting more... but just the fact it's a two part movie leaves a sour taste.... But then again i did not seam to mind.

Oh and the mother of all copouts returns... Eagles! god @#!$!@#$ eagles..... note for the director, if you have a way for your hero and his entire crew to avoid all torture and danger all while giving them the ability to cut their travel time to a couple hours don't let me know... i mean really... i don't want to sit through three hours of adventure, completely impressed with the action and story,  just to end up on a giant eagle that could have picked me up from my house, and flown me to my destination... it just undermines the legitimacy of the entire quest.... not to mention it makes the caricatures seem like complete idiots for not doing so in the first place. but anyways...

4636952,3,B0059XTU1S,I was not at all impressed as with the other Lord of the Rings movies.  It was so 'regular' that it took me all day to watch it.  It came very close to being down right boring and I kept pausing it to go do other things.  Very disappointing. I would not pay over $5 for this DVD if given the chance again.,1369699200,,305,3.8095238095238093

4636954,2,B0059XTU1S,"This had as much potential as any Tolkien episode, but suffers from intrusive music crammed into every nook and cranny, jarring and fast cinematography, and stagey exaggerated vocal delivery.  I prefer a calmer approach to mythology like ""Krull"" where the viewer is almost able to forget it's a movie and really soak in the mood and visuals.  Jackson constantly announces this is ""action"" with a capital ""A.""",1369699200,,408,5.074626865671642

The first time we had to stop watching the movie and return the next day.  The second time, the freeze was only for a few minutes.  But this is the second movie we've rented and had these problems.

Then, I realized, wait a minute they are gonna stretch this out for 2 movies?  A little research and it is actually 3 movies?  Crap.  Why would the take a basic book and drag it out for 3 movies, besides just trying to make 3x the amount of money?  This could have been accomplished much better in one 3 hour movie.",1369699200,,467,4.261363636363637

It was also confusing. And looooonnnggg.

We have watched the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I am not a devotee, but I enjoyed them. The story did move along. In ""The Hobbit,"" I think you had to have read the books a few dozen times to follow what was happening.

I suspect this is a minority opinion. But I really think the filmmakers are working hard to cram one movie's worth of content into three films. Ka-ching!!!!!",1369699200,,520,4.630434782608695

4636970,2,B0059XTU1S,"I think I read The Hobbit decades ago and don't remember the story, I saw The Lord of the Rings and enjoyed it, though I wouldn't say I am an avid fan.  In The Hobbit I recognized the faces of many of the leads and greatly like the actors but the story didn't engage me.  The Hobbit isn't presented as a stand alone story, in my opinion, the audience really has to know the back story to enjoy it.  I don't remember the back story and so wasn't able to enjoy it.  Visually the sets looked so lush and the colors so vivid, as to make the movie seem especially fake looking; I also disliked the swooping shots from the sky.  Didn't hate it, just didn't care for it - was unable to sit through the entire movie, watched the first act maybe, then fast forwarded to about 15 minutes from the end.",1369612800,6,791,4.143790849673203

I think that Martin Freeman is an excellent choice for Bilbo Baggins and I found myself admiring him for leaving the life he loves behind to help perfect strangers regain their home.

4636985,3,B0059XTU1S,"I am fan of both Tolkien and action movies so basically this movie should have been right up my alley. It was good enough to be seen twice at cinema of which second viewing at IMAX where all the visual glory of the film worked well. But on the DVD this visual magic is almost gone and all the negative issues are starting to raise their ugly heads - and this I mean pretty much literally as when White Orc, Radagast, stone giants and gobling king were just minor annoyances in cinema they felt totally ridiculous when watching on DVD. Radagast at least somehow carried the storyline but others just dragged the story on and on and on and on and there was just too much CGI and too little heart in big part of the movie.

There are excellent parts in the movie too: it is mostly good until dwarves leave Rivendell. New Zealand scenery is fantastic, music is beautiful and especially dwarven theme is really haunting - it is also nice that music utilizes already familiar themes from LOTR so that especially elves and Gollum can be also ""heard"". Acting is mostly ok too: Martin Freeman IS Bilbo and there are some gems amongst dwarves that hopefully will get more screen time in following movies as now personality of different dwarves was unfortunately sacrificed to excess of action scenes. Even now Balin and Bofur were loveable and of course ""hottie"" dwarves got plenty of screen time...  I was slightly disappointed how Saruman's character was portayed but just seeing Sir Christopher Lee is always a delight - Cate Blanchett's Galadried was also weirdly spooky but it still did not bother me too much... unlike White Orc and gobling king which were just ridiculous... at least goblin king we will not see again but I guess I still need to tolerate White Orc as despite my annoyance I do still intend to see following movies and hope there is more time for different dwarves to ""grow"" and hopefully there will be some more singing by the dwarves too.",1369526400,,1953,4.609195402298851

It just cannot be done. I have to assuage my outrage and depression by acknowledging the books, were at least created. Sadly the author ran out of time.

4637025,5,B0059XTU1S,"When I heard that the movie of The Hobbit had been made into three parts, I was totally dumbfounded as to why given that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/0544003411/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;was made up of three books, all of which were longer thank the book of The Hobbit.
But I have seen now the skill in which The Hobbit was fleshed out and parts taken from The Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silmarillion/dp/0618126988/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silmarillion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfinished-Tales-of-Numenor-and-Middle-earth/dp/0618154051/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth</a>. The book The Hobbit itself , lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring. The movie actually brings some of these references into the story much more fully, especially the Last White Council, and brings in the great friend of the trees and animals, Radagast the Brown (played by Sylvester McCoy).
This movie was certainly as good as The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins , a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf (once again Ian McKellen excels in the role) and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield (played with majesty and gravitas), to wrest the Dwarves lost homeland of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wargs , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world.

Each of the Dwarves has its own character and is played with skill and entertainingly so. Great recreation of Rivendell , the reappearance of Hugo Weaving as Elrond and Kate Blanchett as Galadriel. The full grotesque loathsomeness of Orc chieftains such as the revolting Great Goblin (Barry Humphries) and the sheer evil of the Orc king Azog (Manu Bennett). Highlights include Bilbo's encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and the great concluding scene with The Eagles.

4637054,2,B0059XTU1S,"Overall the movie wasn't too horrible, but when I think of what this movie should have been, I just downright refuse to accept this movie as being a good one. As soon as they announced that they were splitting ""The Hobbit"" into three parts, I knew immediately not to pay full price for it. I used some Amazon Credit to stream it much much later.

My List of complaints. The things that just destroyed the entire movie for me,starting with the worst.

-3D:
The biggest gimmick to ever grace the film industry. At first I was open to the idea, since they were actually producing the movie in 3D rather than doing a quick post-production deal to make a quick buck. But this movie reaffirmed my distaste for 3D. It completely destroys good cinematography. What should be epic, beautiful, meaningful shots, angles and scenes, become these bizarre, cartoon-ey, annoying events that don't fit well into the grand scheme of any film, all to make things ""pop out"" at people.

-CGI:
Way too much CGI. Wow. CGI definitely has its place in a movie, but this movie used it wrong, and excessively. In fact, they used so much CGI I'm surprised they even bothered filming the movie in 3D at all. Most of the gimmicky ""pop"" scenes were CGI anyways, so why even bother using the camera when it was just going to be done on a computer anyways? Why were ALL of the Orc and Goblin characters CGI? I get it for the Trolls, the Giants and orcs in large numbers, but why in the world couldn't they come up with a handful of decent costumes for at least the main Orc characters like Azog and the Goblin Chief in Moria? The CGI orc characters were just bad. They looked bad, they moved really bad and I had to look at them over and over. It is a far-cry from what Peter Jackson did in the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Maybe in the future with better technology this can be pulled off, but for now, there really is no substitute for good lighting, well-crafted sets, props, costumes and make-up, stunts and real outdoor scenery. All things that made the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies great, and ""The Hobbit"" had few to none of them.

-Three Parts:
Obviously, three movies made sense for ""The Lord of the Rings"" because there were three 'books'. Three movies for ""The Hobbit; which was a single book and much shorter than any of the LOTR books, makes absolutely no sense at all. As a result, we got a movie teeming with boring, dragging filler material. The subplot with Azog is lame and boring, and doesn't really fall in line with the real story. I got really annoyed with reading his pointless subtitles very quickly. Radagast was given too much time and too major a role. I liked seeing an interesting character that played virtually no role in the books, but they took him too far to use him as poor filler material. I didn't mind too much of the back-story and lore-type filler, but overall it really takes away from the story to artificially make it 3 times longer than it should be. Being concise was part of the beauty of the written work. Short, easy to read, easy to follow, but still rich and entertaining. Too bad the Movies won't reflect that aspect of the story.

-Story problems and Miscellaneous:
I am usually quite supportive of creative adaptations by film-makers on existing stories, which is why this falls at the bottom of my list. To be honest, I didn't find most of the deviations all that bad. Radagast's appearance is actually a nice touch, though they took it a bit too far. Some back-story and lore scenes that didn't really appear in the book were a nice touch in my opinion. A few things bugged me though. I really didn't like their deviation from the book in the troll scene. I didn't like how they handled the Moria scenes. (Finding the Elven swords was not accurate, the goblins' reactions to the Elven swords was too downplayed, the fact that Gandalf arrived fashionably late when he should have actually been there the whole time, etc.) The orcs' and the trolls' dialogue was just not done well. Now that I think of it, the fact that they had enough dialogue for me to criticize is a complaint in itself. The voicing was bad, and frankly, they had too much of it. The Goblin Chief giving long, well-versed monologues, cracking wise and singing and stuff just didn't really fit at all.

-Conclusion: Overall the movie was Ok, but its mediocrity is what made me dislike it so much given the movie's potential. I love Tolkien's works, and I absolutely loved the LOTR movies. I was excited for the Hobbit, especially because Peter Jackson really did do a phenomenal job with the LOTR trilogy. Apparently though, he decided to get greedy and lazy and pump the movie(s) with lots of filler, gimmicky 3D and excessive, mediocre CGI. It was just downright sad to expect the magnificent story, scenery, cinematography, action, costuming and careful CGI of the LOTR trilogy films, then get 3 hours of this bizarre, boring, computer generated, gimmicky, cartoon that is only part 1 of 3. I don't think I can stomach the thought of watching another 6 hours worth of ""The Hobbit"" movies after this crap. In my wildest dreams, I never would have thought it would be so easy to botch ""The Hobbit"", being the most concise, interesting and riveting story of all of Tolkien's works. Yet Peter Jackson botched it. Very sad.",1369267200,,5307,4.581052631578947
4637055,3,B0059XTU1S,I like it. It was a good movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good and clean entertainment.,1369180800,,111,4.333333333333333
4637056,2,B0059XTU1S,"Jackson masterfully adapted Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy into a trilogy of movies. That was appropriate.  ""The Hobbit,"" however, is a single volume, and more a children's story.  Like many children's stories, it has action and scares, but it always struck me as more lighthearted and less allegorical than ""Lord of the Rings.""

I suppose it is a matter of taste.  I can accept eliminating some scenes in a book when adapting it for film, but I have difficulty accepting inserting scenes and characters that the author never intended  to exist to expand a movie.  It seems not only extremely presumptuous, but also may let the director's ego and narcissism run rampant. I think that is what happened here. The cast are excellent.  Ian McKellen returns in a masterful performance of Gandalf, and Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins is convincing and enjoyable.  Richard Armitage's Thorin doesn't seem to be as empathetic a character as John Rhys-Davies's Gimli, but it's still a professional performance.

The visuals are spectacular, but the story drags, and is presented as ominous prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"", something I don't think Tolkien had in mind when he first penned ""The Hobbit"". As spectacular as the CGI is, how many escapes across rickety, dilapidated bridges over deep chasms can anyone watch? I have already sold my copy on eBay.

You are dropped right back into an amazing world. Beuatiful landscapes, fun characters, and amazing special effects make you want to stay. Of course gollum was great.
There are many things that could be critiqued. I won't get tedious. If I were to pick one things about this film that didn't quite jive I would say it was that the film didn't quite know what it was. It is a children's book set in the same world we all know from the Lord of the Rings. So there are moments where we get the silly humor, but it is hard to forget how serious Jackson is trying to make it as well.

4637074,3,B0059XTU1S,"While not a Tolkienite, I enjoyed The Hobbit for what it was, a good story.  I saw this in the cinema and then at home.  It is heavily padded with orc killing if not fabricated with 'novel' appearances (Galadriel, Radogast).  Central to every scene are the improbable appearing dwarves with terrible makeup and hairpieces.  It is peculiar that most of the dwarves look like clowns or Snow White versions, while Thorin is noble appearing in bearing, albeit short.  The pacing is poor and  the beginning meeting with them in the Shire was ponderous.  Radogast plays a slapstick role, which I happened to enjoy, but others might not.  The killing of orcs in Moria is so numerous as to become not just gratuitous, but boring.  I also noted quite uneven sound, very very loud alternating with muddy quality in the speech on the home version, it made me think I was watching a Robert Altman movie.

4637090,3,B0059XTU1S,"I didn't know anything about how Peter Jackson was going to tackle The Hobbit, but have read the book many times over the years and was looking forward to it.  That being said...I wasn't sure if this was The Hobbit or if I had forgotten what was in the book.  Yes, the essential plot was there, but there was so much added and I didn't realize ahead of time that he had decided to break it up into three movies and so felt like...hey, are they ever going to get to Smaug?

Anyway, after I figured this out, I am of mixed feelings about the movie.  I could have done without the cutesy dwarf singing and slinging of dishes at the beginning of the movie, but I greatly enjoyed the albino warg addition and I even liked the sled pulled by rabbits (go figure!).

I guess also do like the idea of having aspects of other works pulled into the Hobbit as this may be the only chance to see them on-screen, such as the Brown Wizard.  However, I also lean towards purism and wanting to see The Hobbit more as written.

So...mixed feelings.  But I will keep the movie and go see the rest and withhold final judgment until they are all out.  Still looking forward to Smaug!",1369094400,,1162,4.269406392694064

I enjoyed all of their casting choices immensely and the cinematography was visually stunning. My biggest issue was the story (the screenplay of course, the Tolkien source material was a work of art). That being said, I think part 2 of this series is going to be a great story and for those who haven't read the books (I say books because I think they will be drawing material from the Silmarillion) Part 3 will take some viewers by surprise.

Unlike the LOTR series, I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters (except maybe Gollum). I agree with some other reviewers that some of the action scenes were overdone, and way too much time was spent getting the adventure underway (at least it felt that way).

To me, this movie was more about making money than anything else.

i guess after the lord of the rings it was hard for jackson to come up with an encore; it did seem at times he was just going through the motions with this one.
 i'm not sure about the attempts at comedy. i like martin freeman, and he was pretty good as bilbo, but perhaps the light-hearted timbre of parts of the movie made the dark parts less dark, thus reducing the tension, leaving one with a bit of an 'oh well' feeling at the end. for instance, the scene with the trolls is great on its own, but i feel it makes the subsequent scene with the pale orc a bit less threatening. good and evil is evened out a bit. the film has a light and breezy feel like harry potter. contrast this with the innocence of frodo vs the undiminished and seemingly overwhelming evil present in LOTR!

i guess when you know a film is going to make billions of dollars, it saps the creativity a bit, even if you are a kiwi. on the other hand, disappointing as it was, it still deserves 3 stars, or maybe 2.5",1369008000,,1237,4.215189873417722

The appeal of the characters, the level of action, the intrigue and the mysticism are again present in high level of quality and quantity.  I had been concerned that stretching one book into a movie trilogy would lessen the tale.  I was wrong because Peter Jackson made a movie that provides a bridge to the lord of the Rings trilogy.  He also takes the time to visually tell the background stories of the main characters.  The 2-3 longer verbal moments (something he actually did in his LOTR movies) do give the movie fan a chance to think and catch one's breath.  Overall, it is a visually-stunning, colorful and engaging movie.  Like his earlier trilogy, I believe each film will get better and end in a wonderful climax.",1369008000,,818,4.678321678321678

Doing so was probably a mistake because during the movie I kept wondering where all the extra action was coming from and why the movie ended with a different conclusion than the novel.  I also gained the impression that the producers were going to herculean efforts to stretch a trilogy out of a fairly slim novel.

The story line is fairly easy to follow and is similar in format to the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. From beginning to end, the movie holds your attention and sets up the next two films perfectly. Of course, there are a few things I would change but I believe every true Tolkien fan will find something that they don't agree with. Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is worth your money and will certainly leave you anxiously awaiting The Desolation of Smaug!",1368835200,,711,4.476923076923077

The movies are wonderful, but they don't mirror the original story--lots of liberties taken so as to condense the storyline.  I so very much wish they'd made it into a longer series of movies instead (several for each book), because there's so much of the story that wasn't told which IS relevant to the storyline, and it would've kept people coming back for many years.

I watched this with some who loved what they remembered of the Lord of Rings movies but not huge mega fans, and Im not  a fanatic myself, but I did love the movie.  I thought the pacing was good for the scenes that were in here.  At first I was on the fence when I heard there was extra in here, the book was my favorite of the four because the most action happened in it and I was afraid it was going to feel over drawn.  After seeing it I welcomed the addition of additional story that wasn't in the book but fits the time frame.  The pace was that of a regular life ticking along at the pace it had always known but change was blowing in, and when adventure comes knocking you would be a fool to turn it away.  The film looked good and I am looking forward to watching it again though I am very likely to have it on in the background since I,  unlike our little hobbit friend, do not have that much free time to watch it all again.

I was happy to hear it was finally going to be a movie directed by Peter Jackson. The movie did a pretty good job sticking with the original story line, but a lot more has been added. I think the extra stuff came from his other books and writings, which I haven't read. I mean they're making it into three films and after the first movie we're nearly halfway over with the book, The Hobbit's, story. They added the white orc, I think that was necessary. I feel like the goblins were enough trouble. But overall, I still love this movie. Gollum scared the bejeezus out of me and I knew how that was going to go down already. Still nearly wet my pants...

Cinematography, special effects,and all that jazz is not as important to me as the finer details. The casting, the music, and Jackson's wonderful team of designers/costumers  make the film.  Casting Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield was genius. After treating Gimli as a sort of comic relief in LOTR I'm glad to see that Jackson could see the proud, dark, noble side of dwarves as well. Many of the reviews complained about the long songs!  I guess those folks never read the book.  The Hobbit book is full of song and poetry and I was thrilled by the inclusion of some of it.

Once again, this film, though not as good as the other three movies, was entertaining, adventurous, and a wonderful revisit to Middle Earth. The scenery and imagery throughout the movie was just as beautiful and awe-inspiring as the other movies.

We revisited familiar characters such as Gandalf, Salomon, and Golem, and returned to familiar places such as the Shire and Moria. I think the plot in this film did not have the same depth as the Lord of the Ring movie, but nevertheless, I enjoyed it.

I haven't read ""The Hobbit"" yet, so I can't compare the film to the book. But I understand there is no way the film could capture all the rich detail and side plots of the book - and this was already an almost 3 hour movie!

It's been a while since I've read the book, suffice to say, there is allot in the movie that's not in the book, usually is the opposite. Why are we being subjected to 2-3 movies to tell the tale? I didn't find the book this confusing and Jackson seems to adding characters from the Lord of the Rings story line into the move. The dynamics of the story and pacing are not as cohesive as they could be. I watched this with my family, my wife fell asleep, the 5 year old left the room, and my 8 year old thought it was boring.

The characters are all well acted, and the dialogue is adequate, although the game of riddles with Golum was torture to sit through,,,just can't understand what's being said.

4637179,5,B0059XTU1S,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey "" (2012)  is the first of three ""The Hobbit"" films. Cannot wait till Christmas to see the next installment.

A Quality job and the signature richness in colors and sets and emotions and richness in the story that makes it worth re-viewing - over and over - to catch wonderful bits missed in earlier viewings or to clarify a detail.

  I read the Hobbit books - all of them ""en famille"" around the fireplace in the 1970s and husband and children. We were so charmed by the goodness and entertainment in the books that we'd long for a QUALITY film about it all. So the fine job Peter Jackson and company have done here has been a thrill - more and better than we hoped for!

Quality is the keyword  - the Brothers Hildebrandt artwork was everyone's favorite and they used it , faithfully, to tell the stories , as faithfully.  Really good work.  The costume, makeup and set design is the best , though sometimes the camera editing seemed to lose it re: the dwarf noses. :-D  A bit of a putty look showing.  But I am descended in part form artisans who looked a lot like them from the good hard work , full of allergens and jolly, hearty ways to counteract it, so I am a fine authority and happy to report they did a fine job of it all.  This past decade they have passed away - all but one - at grand old age -  and so the stories warm me more than ever.

The books are long because Tolkien sets up his scenarios at length, and shares  not just the fun dishwashing magic song in the early scenes of ""The Hobbit"" , but a song and poem made and shared for every event, and references to their ancient forebears in every major moment.

SOME setup is necessary if we are to be in full sympathy with the story, and its characters, so I would have liked to have seen a bit more at outset about the wonders of the Dwarf kingdom.  Although they DID share some footage of the emerald and gold walls and columns and monuments in Erebor within the Lonely Mountain.  I would have liked to have seen a grand tour of the place  ( an extended edition that does just that, maybe?)  as a FOCUS not a ""while-you're up"", since, that way we are able to be properly empathetic with the terrible loss of their kingdom and home, when it comes, and to long for restoration with the Dwarves.

  It was nice to finally see a lady dwarf, as Gimli said in ""LOTR: The Two Towers""  that the women can be so shy that it is often thought there ARE no dwarf women. They are lovely, and probably skilled.

It is my only grievance with Tolkien - he and his wife were a famous romance and very happy, but when Tolkien was a boy, with a delver Father, he himself and his brother were orphaned and raised by priests who sent him to Oxford in light of his prodigious mind in childhood. This was a fortunate thing for Tolkien and the world ( i.e., us )  But his culture was very male - no girls.

To add to it: Then he was a good and happy Father - of four  boys, and I think his classes when he taught were all-male as well.
This, of course, leads to the experience of the females in the book as either boyish or even mannish warriors,  or shy and ""uber-ladies"", possessed of the love to the point of extreme sacrifice and the range of old-days classical skills. But none of the women in the story are ""today women"", in spite of gentle efforts on the part of production to portray the women as important, at least, to the story, and full of virtue.  And the story is set in ""olden days"" when things were male-dominated, and so we are happy that it goes as nicely as it does on that point.

I am always charmed by the personalities of the characters, major and minor - they all have a way of endearing us. A turn of the head, a tone of voice, a quirk in the ways - so faithfully done up by the Wingnuts here. Thanks so much Peter Jackson and folk of Middle Earth.",1368662400,,3856,4.191316146540027

4637196,5,B0059XTU1S,"This review refers to the ""Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Blu ray 3D/2D/DVD combo pack"" and no other edition. Readers please take note of this.

UPDATE October 2013:
The extended version of the Hobbit has a running time of 182 min, whereas the theatrical cut is 169 min. So, the extended version has ONLY 13 EXTRA MINUTES OF ADDED FOOTAGE (As I mentioned previously in my review: The additions are not expected to be as huge as those of LOTR).

It was a pleasure to return to Peter Jackson's middle earth after nearly a decade (The last time it was LOTR). Hobbit is hugely entertaining, exceptionally well done movie that has been created by carefully handling the original subject. Here is what you get in this product, what is this movie about, and a little food for thought if anyone wants to wait for ""extended version"" of the movie, which is supposed to be released sometimes at the end of this year.

1. THE PRODUCT:
Hobbit blu ray dazzles by all means. The picture ans sound quality is reference grade, and the details are exceptional. This set has both 3D and 2D versions of the movie, a special feature (Blu ray, High Def), DVD and the ultraviolet digital copy. Hence, this gives you an options of watching the movie in all possible formats. The 3D quality is superb, with exceptional depth and clarity. Having owned many 3D blu rays, I would rank this among top 10 blu rays out there.

2. THE MOVIE:
Hobbit is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and is based upon the children's book by JRR Tolkien of the same name. Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of the trilogy, and the next two movies are as follows:
Movie 2: Hobbit: The desolation of the Smaug (scheduled for Dec 2013)
Movie 3: Hobbit: There and back again (Scheduled for Dec 2014)
The book is classic, there is no doubt about it. However Peter Jackson did an exceptional work in bringing Tolkien's creation to the celluloid. His passion about the subject is known to the world, and equally admired. Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no exception. Though there will be debates whether the movie was completely true to the book or not, I personally feel that making a TRILOGY over ONE childrens book is no joke, and only Peter Jackson's vision would have made this possible.
The movie appeared slow to many, which I can understand, because Hobbit, in general, has little less material than the LOTR. However, I felt it was about the right length, as I like to stay in Jackson's middle earth for little longer. Most importantly, the movie doesn't get bore at any time, and has the exceptional art of storytelling (IMO, You do not rush when you tell a story. The most important part is to keep the audience engaged, and this movie does it brilliantly). Hence, if you loved LOTR, Hobbit is a must buy, as this gives you the opportunity to visit the middle earth one more time.

3. EXTENDED EDITION: Should you wait (and if yes, then how long, and that too, for mere extra 13 minutes)
There are announcements being made about the extended version of this movie being launched in Dec 2013. With the LOTR history, I wouldn't be surprised about it. However, before you completely ignore this 3D edition, there are few things I would like to point out:
a. Even if extended version gets out, I doubt it will be in 3D. Looks like 2D would be the only option.
b. Only a true fan of the movie would wait for the extended version, right? In that case, think: there are TWO more movies yet to come, so, your wait is not going to be ""over"" by Dec 2013. There will be two more 'theatrical' hobbits (and let's assume even they will have extended counterparts). I understand I am going too far, but I said only because even I have those movies in my wish list already! Hence, even I am thinking of making a 'wise buy"" than double dip. So, think a little ahead before you make any decision.
c. As of today, what I hear is even if the extended edition is out, it will have 25-30 min of extra footage (Not huge addition like LOTR). I don't doubt that those additions will be great, but they don't seem to be as huge as they were for LOTR.
d. Even with 'theatrical' vs 'exdended' movies, I don't think they will be sold together. Most likely it will follow the LOTR saga (Remember, you still don't have Theatrical and Extended LOTR on one Blu ray/Blu ray set due to space limits).

Summary:
If you like to see Hobbit in 3D, go for this edition. I really doubt the extended version (if it's out and whenever it's out) will get a 3D blu ray release. You will have plenty of 2D (regular ) blu ray editions to come in future (by making all permutations and combinations), but I have not seen 3D versions of the trilogies being sold seperately. With the exceptional lengths of these movies, I doubt there will be an ""all in one"" pack. Make a wise choice considering your personal preferences.",1368576000,4,4859,4.497168742921858

4637226,4,B0059XTU1S,"Its no Lord of the Rings but Jackson does a good job of making Thoren the dwarf as appealing as possible. As usual he strays from the books. His version of the Woodland Wizard broke the tone of the movie and made it cartoonish. I like the character he chose for Bilbo. What I really didn't like was he took the magic out of the movie by the way he filmed it, more like a TV soap opera than a adventure in Rivendale with elves.

What I didn't like was the trolls grrrr he used the same voices as the orcs in the Lord of the Rings and some of the same dialogue, it really took away from the books and made you feel Jackson wasn't trying all that hard.",1368489600,,649,3.9923076923076923
4637227,5,B0059XTU1S,"These guys can do nothing wrong in my book.  Okay, the Goblin City scenes were a little bit hokey and seemed to be playing to the future video game franchise.  Radagast was a bit hokey too, but then we skipped ol' Tom Bombadil in LOTR, so maybe this is making up for it.  Other than that, I absolutely loved this film.  The tweaks Jackson worked on the original story line work for me, and the suspense of not really seeing Smaug yet is still killing me.  The Dwarves were awesome, Gandalf was Gandalf and the Bilbo really worked, perhaps better than the actor from LOTR.

4637235,5,B0059XTU1S,"I was very excited when I heard Peter Jackson was going to make The Hobbit into a movie. Yes, there was still money to be made out of this franchise, but I'd rather have Peter Jackson tackle this story and stories from The Simarillion than anyone else. The Hobbit is a softer, simpler story than Lord of the Rings, but it is still a good companion to the other three movies. Visual effects, costuming, make up are beautiful. The costumer did a great job creating looks for each of the dwarfs to distinguish them. And Andy Serkis as Gollum is amazing. It's a good movie. You should watch it at least once.

I was disappointed in the DVD, because it wasn't simple to get the digital copy to put on my devices which is why I bought this version. For future purchases, I will attempt to avoid the ultra violet digital version because it wasn't helpful to me.",1368403200,,854,4.405063291139241

As an avid writer I thought it was good.  Close to the book.

For Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, I still say Hobbit should have been dome first if they were going to go to those extremes.  I was ticked that Lord of the Rings was done first over the Hobbit.  Would have made more sense.

This and Lord of the Rings were the first of this genre, so that hard to say/",1368403200,,595,4.0085470085470085
4637237,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the book and the LoTRs books. I think Peter Jackson did a great job on each of the LoTRs movies. I think the cinematography has gotten better over time, with The Hobbit the best ""looking"" of them all. I think they did a great job of putting the right stuff into the LoTRs movies. Yes, The Hobbit is a much smaller story. Yes, I think they could have done it in a single film. BUT I very much like the stuff they added in. It serves to give lots of background information that is not in The Hobbit itself, but is in other writings by JRRT. I think the background/added material does a very good job of helping to explain Thorin's motivation for his quest. For me, there was only one small part that seemed overly long and that was the flight from the goblins leading to Rivendell. Other than that, I think the action ""set pieces"" were cool and entertaining. I have read lots of reviews complaining about the additional material that was not strictly in the book, too much action that wasn't in the book, etc. Why not view the movie as ""based on the story from The Hobbit"" rather than ""The Hobbit"".

I've also read plenty of reviews that complain about the early scenes introducing the dwarves as being overly long. I really enjoy all of those scenes and getting to learn a bit about the dwarves as individuals. I like Balin quite a lot. Thorin isn't exactly likeable but I feel like I got some understanding of him and his motivations and reasons for acting the way he does. I think all of this was important to the overall story, and I just plain enjoy the scenes early in the movie introducing the dwarves. It's fun stuff.

Let me also throw in here that the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum are pure gold. They did an amazing job with Gollum. The facial expressions, the movement, everything is just awesome. They managed to make Gollum funny and scary and sad and pathetic and dangerous and cute and just freakin' nuts all at once. Kudos. Andy Serkis is amazing in this role.

One of the things that I have liked about Peter Jackson's JRRT movies is that he seems unafraid of lingering over certain moments, of allowing scenes the length they deserve, of not just rushing toward the next action part. Another thing I have found about the movies that is particularly gratifying is that they are fun to watch multiple times. I have watched each of the LoTRs movies many times and still enjoy them each time. I have already watched The Hobbit at least 10 times, and I like it better the more I see it.

Don't worry about any negative reviews or comments. If you like fantasy stories and fantasy movies, watch The Hobbit. It is beautifully shot, has interesting and entertaining characters (the Bilbo and Gollum scenes are fantastic!), some very fun action scenes, and the action finale is quite gripping.",1368403200,,2842,4.480694980694981
4637238,4,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is great. It has only very little to do with The Hobbit novel but is, instead, mainly related to other writings from Tolkien. This would explain why Saruman, Galadriel, and Radagast, make appearances in the movie but not in the novel.

The Hobbit does a great job of referencing The LOTR trilogy at almost every turn (especially The Fellowship). The only time it doesn't reference the other movies is the only time it actually should have - which is when Bilbo comes to posses the One Ring in the first place.

Still, it is quite enjoyable and Martin Freeman makes a very good Bilbo Baggins. I'm certainly glad I got it.",1368403200,,654,4.629310344827586

Thankfully it didn't, The Hobbit does indeed stand on its own, thanks mostly to a fantastic lead performance from Martin Freeman who is perfect as Bilbo Baggins. Unfortunately, what I didn't like was the slow, song-filled first 90 minutes. Okay, so ""song-filled"" is a slight exaggeration, there are only two songs... but for a fantasy epic, that's two songs too many! It took far too long for them to begin their quest, and when they did there were moments (like the troll scene) that I didn't think added anything to the plot or characters. I read somewhere that there were supposed to be only 2 movies in this saga, but they had so much footage they decided to turn it into three movies. This kinda tainted my viewing, as I felt that a lot of scenes should have ended up on the cutting room floor instead of stretching two movies into three (and making more money out of cinema-goers). But all this aside, I must say that the last hour of the movie in the Goblin King's tunnels was fantastic!!

The Lord of the rings trilogy on paper was also just a trilogy on film, so I don't see why it wasn't the same on film. Long time fans wouldn't have been upset by a longer film which is what it would have taken to reach the conclusion. All in all it just appears to alter the continuity by, not just making it a prequel as opposed to making the hobbit first, but dividing it into two parts rather than one which I thought was rather uncool for those folks who haven't read the book. Just my two cents.",1368230400,,639,4.12

I was tempted to wait for all three parts of this before I watched it.  After all, I read the hobbit in less than a week first time, so many years ago.  There were not any places I wanted to put the book down.  Later, I enjoyed reading this book out loud several times, a chapter at a sitting.  No one wanted to wait more than a day for the next reading.  Having watched this first part, I am finding waiting a year for the second part a little disconcerting, even though I thoroughly know the story.  I did not feel this way for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I suppose this means that the movie is good as a movie, not just the most accurate recasting of a fantasy book into a movie that I have experienced.  I look forward to the next film if only to see that they did the next segment well or poorly.

The bonus materials, which I believe are all weblogs created during the filming are interesting, showing locations and the marvelous sets they created,  But watching this as a single stream is rather long.  It would be nice if Amazon split it into episodes.",1368230400,,1292,4.224489795918367

4637281,5,B0059XTU1S,"Although the film story diverges a little from the actual book, one can easily see (if one is a Tolkien devotee) why the divergences are included and how they fit so well.  Radagast is a brilliant character (he simply doesn't play a major part in the book) but he assists in creating the escape sequence that is necessary for the whole party to reach Rivendell.  Gollum's depiction is brilliant, and I was extremely pleased to see the small sequence in which Bilbo spares his life......it has far reaching consequences that only come to full fruition in the Lord of the Rings.  The eagle sequence is also cleverly done, even though it is not ""book accurate"".  However, it cuts out a section of the book that has little place in the film and leaves the party at the appropriate point where they can then move towards Beorn's house.  While the Necromancer is only referred to obliquely in The Hobbit book, it is obvious that it is Sauron who is trying to rebuild his body and the advent of the sorceror King of Angmar is an equally important prelude to the Lord of the Rings.  It was clever to put the council meeting at Rivendell......this gets the main players into the action and ready for the next part in the last section where the White Council forces Sauron out of Dol Guldur.

It was excellent seeing the same actors playing the roles they did in LOTR.  Cate gives you a much clearer insight into who she is portraying.  Even for an elf she carries her age of 10,000 years well and emits the power she controls.  Only at the end of LOTR did the three elfin rings come together.  A very powerful scene in Rivendale.

At least I can give the DVD to my daughter.

The movie is visually fine. The plot is so different from the book that I really enjoyed it - I never knew exactly what was going to happen next!

From the Lord of the Rings first film, where he clearly was thinking more with his man parts than anything else (otherwise Liv Tyler would not have been in it so much), which caused us to miss the great story characters like Tom Bombadil and Goldberry...to the wholesale clobbering of the Hobbit where the classic scenes like Troll's turning to stone, or the Giants having a stone battle (not stone giants having a battle) or the names of the pony's...changed....why? Not for time (except to make one movie into three), not for story...clearly the popularity of the books shows we all loved the story as it was...not to fix plot errors of the original...because he's created so many they really cannot be fixed. So as of now, I promise, I will remake the films. I've wanted to make them since I was six and read the books to my ailing mother as she lie sick, in bed for months.

If this formula were applied to the LOTR trilogy, we would have gotten nine movies for a total of 27+ hours of film. Because of this, The Hobbit is painfully slow and repetitive. With a few simple edits, this movie easily could have ended at the two hour mark while maintaining the integrity of the story.

Perhaps it is inevitable that one film's vision of a story so deeply beloved by so many will be found wanting in some particulars.  I count myself among the most enduring and intense of admirers of J.R.R. Tolkien's world, and I must say that I enjoyed large sections of The Hobbit.  I found the Bag End scenes between Bilbo and Gandalf enchanting, and I enjoyed most of the Unexpected Party scenes, though Jackson took some liberties which I found deplorable (croquet balls, indeed!!!!)  Similarly I enjoyed the Rivendell scenes (though where Jackson got the idea that Elves are vegetarians is beyond my comprehension.) Overall, where the film sticks closest to Tolkien's own story it is most successful.

Unfortunately Jackson repeats the errors he made in The Lord of the Rings trilogy by focussing on long, violent stretches of battle and conflict. Much of the magic of Tolkien disappears in the sword play.  While I recognize that this was undoubtedly a good box office move, nevertheless I would have enjoyed more poetry and less bloodshed.

4637377,1,B0059XTU1S,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I hated pretty much everything about this movie, but here are the main points:

Expanding on Tolkien's mythology: Presumably, the reason you should ""never trust an Elf!"" (Gimli's line in TFotR) is because Elves turned their back on the Dwarfs when they were being attacked by Smaug? What were they expected to do against a dragon and why were they just standing there anyway? This is basically adding a whole new level of mythology. A no-no, unless it's an improvement and that's not the case here.

The dwarfs: They looked ridiculous to me and their behavior was annoying. But no dwarf was more off-putting than Thorin with his ludicrous fur-trimmed leather duster, Rob Zombie do and constant glowering. Ugh.

The introductory scene takes too long but, given all this time, you'd think Jackson would try and be more faithful to the book. But, no, he still manages to mangle it. Anyway, the next day, after Bilbo has decided not to go the day before (he wasn't really given the choice in the book), he just...goes. And it's very interesting that he's able to, on foot, overtake Gandalf and the dwarfs all riding along briskly on horseback. And when he does catch up, he's offered a pony, which he at first declines. Why? Bilbo had nothing against riding a pony.

Azog: The footnote springs to cinematic life and has a vendetta against Thorin. The character in the LotR Appendix, for all of his two-pages of appearance and death at the hands of Din, is still more bad-ass than the video game reject in AUJ. Anyway, if Jackson wanted to go this route, it would have made more sense to just go with Azog's son Bolg, who will appear anyway.

Trolls: or, how to take an amusing sequence from the book and drain it of any humor whatsoever. Actually, that opinion that applies to the whole movie. But, instead of Gandalf employing ventriloquism on the trolls and getting them to fight each other, Bilbo tells them the dwarfs have parasites and Gandalf gets to break a rock in two. Yawn.

Radagast: An utterly ridiculous and repellent visualization of another footnote character, with his ridiculous dying hedgehog, rabbit-drawn sleigh and poo-smeared face. But that's just my opinion. But why is he in the movie at all? To tell Gandalf about the Necromancer, I guess. But if Gandalf doesn't already know this (as he does in the book) where did he get the map and key from Thrin (Thorin's father) who (in the book) was a prisoner in Dol Guldur? Presumably, he wasn't in Dol Guldur in the movie. So where is he? It's basically glossed over. In any case, the very idea that Greenwood is turning into Mirkwood right before Radagast's eyes at the start of the movie just strikes me as a desperate and weak attempt to create a sense of urgency and menace. The spiders are even seen entering the forest as if to take up their positions. Also in any case, Gandalf's very reason for being in Middle Earth is to help combat the Necromancer (aka Sauron). For him not to know about his presence in Mirkwood is, sorry, just witless.

Apparent invulnerability: None of the protagonists get hurt in this movie. Stone giants fall on them, they get up. They fall a hundred feet, they just walk it off. Goblins (who, for some reason, are portrayed as distinct from orcs) attack in droves, they just cut them down like wheat. Thorin does later fall unconscious (from a blow that should have crushed his skull), but he later turns out none the worse for wear. Even if these characters weren't profoundly irritating, why should I care about them if they're not in any danger? And enough with the fake deaths. Did anyone watching this really fear the titular character might fall to his death halfway through his own movie?

Riddles in the ""Dark"": Finally, some resemblance to the book, except even here there are details changed for no good reason. And couldn't they have toned down the lighting just a bit more to give some impression of darkness? As for Gollum himself, it's hard to find fault with Andy Serkis, except that Gollum is now basically a celebrity and practically played like one in the film. He no longer surprises, frightens or disturbs in the least. The cosy lighting doesn't help at all.

Bilbo the Badass: Bilbo kills a Warg (which, though strong enough to uproot a tree, will drop with a single arrow or sword thrust/hack). Later he savagely kills an orc. Where'd this come from? Perhaps to make up for Frodo being a wuss in those other movies? Whatever the case, it's so far out of left field, it's just seems tacked on.

Eagles: Gandalf just happens to spot a moth nearby in the tree he's climbed up to avoid the orcs and wargs. How convenient. And the book's explanation for the eagles doesn't work because...? There really is no good reason. Jackson wants to make full use of the eagles, but only as devices; he's averse to giving them any back story or personality or anything. You'd think with his apparent love of exposition and the characters making speeches all the time, something could have been said about them, but no, the eagles just drop them off and depart. They're nothing more than deus ex machina. Granted, there are challenges to following the book more closely here but I still think Jackson takes the cheap way out.

Final scene: Bilbo blithely states ""I do believe the worst is behind us."" Really? Why would he believe this while looking at a mountain that is 1) still leagues distant; and 2) he knows contains a fire-breathing dragon?

I will be surprised if even morbid curiosity compels me to watch any more of these.",1367971200,92,5577,4.672782874617737

It is a masterpiece in visuals and the story (even if your not familiar with the books) draws you in effortlessly.

4637380,5,B0059XTU1S,"If I write a review on a film it is usually 3 - D on the 3 - D.  I am careful in purchasing because the cost is high and I might want to watch without glasses , share with my wife who just as well will pass on 3 - D. Etc.. I first judge focus because often the shots are fore ground and back ground with the rest blurred . This to me is not 3 - D. Next I look for whether you get a stereo view or a true 3 - D effect and if you get at least some shots where it comes out of the screen and or brings you in with peripherals . This film is not perfect because I think the technology is not there yet but I think it's the best movie in the available technology I've seen so far. More than a match for the holy grail of Avatar and as a 5 disk set it wins there too. Extended run time also makes it a bargain . Now for my complaints. Subtitles have no place in 3 - D especially in an imaginary tongue. Nothing but a distraction from the important without anything to add , so for me it is always a major negative. They need to design the case better because it is too easy to damage your disk how they are now , removing and replacing your disk.

4637381,1,B0059XTU1S,"I feel that Peter Jackson became cocky with the success of the Lord of the Ring series of movies.  The LTR movies are awesome and I can't imagine how they could be improved whereas ""The Hobbit"" movie should be erased from this world.
The story line in the book is more than sufficient for making a ""Hobbit"" movie without having to add extra characters such as the white orc and an entire sub plot that doesn't exist in the book.

I did enjoy the extended, non book story line of the council meeting about the necromancer, the dwarve's history and Radagast.

Perhaps, even with the current story line if the movie had been made with more subtlety and less bombastic and typical Hollywood type action it would have been more palatable.  As the movie is, I feel that Peter Jackson, money men and whichever other Hollywood cronies were envolved had some computer programmers read the Cliff's notes on the book- The Hobbit, with directions to make a video game which they could base a movie on.

4637391,5,B0059XTU1S,We have been waiting so long for this to come out.  It is graphically as wonderful as the first 3 and we are so looking forward to the next to to come out as well.  Happy watching!!,1367884800,,181,3.864864864864865
4637392,5,B0059XTU1S,"When The Hobbit was released I read most of the reviews and got instantly depressed. The movie was slow. The movie was dull. The movie was bad. Almost everyone who eventually went to see The Hobbit went in spite of the critics and those wretched reviews. As I watch the blu-ray version of The Hobbit for the third time, I can't help asking anyone who'll listen: what on Earth were the critics watching? What movie did they see and we missed? The Hobbit is a bit more detailed than LOTR, that is true. I think Peter Jackson was responding to those lovers of Tolkien's books who missed some of the whimsy, some of the poetry, some of the songs found in Tolkien that was left out of the three LOTR films out of necessity. So Jackson gives us some of the songs and whimsy and the critics (most of whom have never read any of Tolkien's books) complain. The Hobbit is a brilliant and exciting film. The two follow-up films promise to be even better as they conclude The Hobbit story and begin Sauron's rise in Mirkwood as The Necromancer. As for the critics: perhaps that's why they write about films rather than make them.",1367884800,,1117,4.453658536585366
4637393,5,B0059XTU1S,"This movie was the bomb in the theatre and is a bomb on DVD. I only buy DVDs to watch the movie. I don't buy them to check out the extras, UNLESS there are bloopers. That's it. Good DVD.",1367884800,,186,3.7948717948717947
4637394,5,B0059XTU1S,"This movie is absolutely wonderful! If you're a major fan of the book and fear change you may not be a fan, they did take some liberties with the story. But it was still magical and heartwarming! And fun battles!!!!",1367884800,,215,4.4
4637395,5,B0059XTU1S,"Love the movie, and it quality was perfect. We had never rented a movie online, and this was the first. The quality really was hD, and the movie was awesome..",1367884800,,158,4.3
4637396,5,B0059XTU1S,"I have yet to read the books by J R R Tolkien, but I now find myself wanting to. When I do not know how a story ends it is difficult for me to wait for the next movie to come out! It is obvious to me that the actors have aged 11 years since doing the first trilogy and that they are trying to hide this fact with makeup. Even so, Cate Blanchett still looks pretty good to me. I am waiting to see if Liv Tyler is in any of the remaining movies.

This movie tells how Bilbo Baggins got the ring of power in the first place and why he did not kill Gollum when he had the chance to. It also shows how the trolls got turned into stone and why the elves and dwarfs did not like each other when Gimli met Legolas. I am really looking forward to getting the rest of this tale!

4637397,5,B0059XTU1S,"Okay, my ONLY beef with purchasing ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" - and I bought the 3D version - is that there will be an extended version to be released later this year... Grr... I'm wondering the the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy will be remastered for 3D release (both theatrical and home video). Imagine the Battle of Pelennor Fields...

That having been said, I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I was initially dismayed to know that Peter Jackson would not be directing ""The Hobbit""... Nothing against Guillermo Del Toro's work; on the contrary, it would have been rather interesting to see his take on Tolkien's world. However, given the triumph that was the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I think it's safe to say that Peter Jackson has pretty much breathed life into Tolkien's vision, artistic liberties notwithstanding, and pretty much owns Middle Earth. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" once again made me feel like I did back in 2001. I never even understood all the hoopla surrounding Jackson's use of new projection technology. I found ""The Hobbit"" to be visually stunning and entertaining. Like millions of others, I can't wait for this coming Christmas!",1367798400,,1177,4.914572864321608
4637398,3,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey was ok.  It tied in with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  But the dwarfs, I don't know, it seemed more like a comedy in some of the scenes with them.  The Ork leader was pretty cool.  And the trolls, they were more like the 3 stooges of the middle earth.  On a good note, it left it wide open for the sequel.",1367798400,,342,3.898550724637681
4637399,3,B0059XTU1S,"I had heard The Hobbit was not that good but I thought I'd reserve judgement and see for myself.

Now that I have seen it, I have to say there is much that is good in the movie but I really hope some elements don't continue, such as episodes like that of the Goblin King. The Goblin King was not even slightly scary. It was like I'd suddenly been dropped into a Disney movie, and then I remembered Derek/Robert from Bad Taste and other similar Peter Jackson humour and thought ""You know, I shouldn't be having to remember Bad Taste in the middle of The Hobbit"". PJ needs to leave that stuff out. It wasn't that funny in Bad Taste either.",1367798400,,637,4.264462809917355
4637400,4,B0059XTU1S,"I was anxious to obtain ""The Hobbit"" and was happy to see it arrive quickly and in good order.  A very good movie but maybe not at the same level as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Of course this is only Part One of Two and I believe the second one will be even better than the first.  The bonus disc is definitely worth the price as you get behind the scenes of the making of The Hobbit in a video blog format.  I enjoyed it very much but maybe not as much as the bonus features of the LOTR DVDs.  A must have in your collection if you are a fan even though it doesn't hit the level of the LOTR trilogy.",1367798400,,604,3.838709677419355

4637402,5,B0059XTU1S,For those people who are into Tolkein breaking up The Hobbit into 3 parts is not excessive. Jackson is superb and I am so pleased he has created more in the Tolkein line-up. Fantasy is a difficult genre to interpret with realism. Jackson does it so well. The cast is fabulous and there are softer and touching parts throughout the action.,1367798400,,338,4.557377049180328

4637409,5,B0059XTU1S,"Unfortunately, the Ultraviolet copy (the special show we were to get), was a bust.  I never did get to see it.  It did not stream through like it was supposed to, so (basically) it was a waste of advertising dollars.  Thank GOD that the movie itself, made up for the disappointment of not getting to see the ""special"".",1367798400,,318,4.448275862068965
4637410,2,B0059XTU1S,"Not so much favor for the movie.  Too slow, too sepia toned, too heavy-handed.  The story was a light, adventure tale. The book was fun, creative, and innovative for its time.  The movie almost the total opposite.

Knowing it was the same producers, some original cast, and director, I just went for it, expecting to see the film-maker's version of the first novel. I love these films and loved this one.

4637414,5,B0059XTU1S,I love the original story and while I thought this was a great movie - in my opinion there is nothing to compare to the original story. I just wish that the movie makers would not add or subtract from the book. I am glad I have read  The Hobbit many times so I could spot the differences in the movie. Other than that it is a great movie and was very entertaining.,1367798400,,364,3.9863013698630136

I enjoyed the move a lot, it was worth every penny I paid (though I would have liked to get the little booklet that came with Walmart's version, for the same price). Anyway, Being the prequel to  the ""Lord Of The Rings"", I'm looking forward to the other movies in the story line. BUT, My hang up was that the 3D was poorly mapped out in the movie. There was some blurry 3D scenes in the movie that took away from the quality of the movie. The movie without the 3D effects was easier to watch and enjoy.",1367798400,,529,4.086538461538462

As for the negative reviews because it only half of the story.  Well I much rather them tell the whole story then just turn it into crap, in order to make it fit in one two and a half hour story.  It's what can be expected.  Now if you don't wish to buy 2 movies then just rent it what is 4.00 USD, it's well worth the time.",1367798400,,493,3.5277777777777777

I simply wanted to watch the Hobbit...not some Peter Jackson film which should have been called Thorin or Thorin and Gandalf Part 1: ""Things that happen in Middle Earth"".

Since Bilbo is writing the story (as shown in the opening scene), how is he aware of everything that is happening in the world as we are shown over and over again with rabbit chases and albino Orcs who have no place in the Hobbit?

The ending was atrocious. I was embarrassed watching the whole Goblin cave ""sequence"" (loooooong sequence) and the drama\fight scene with Thorin in the end. The troll scene was also forgettable as was the scene with Gollum. Ridiculous. Tolkien was rolling in his grave.

Rabbit chases, cheezy orc villains, rings that accidentally fall on fingers, lots of reasons this film was a huge dissapointment for me.",1367712000,,863,4.771812080536913

4637441,2,B0059XTU1S,I was very disappointed with the attempt at humor and a lot of the acting. It seemed they tried to emulate what they did in LOTR and just fell short.,1367625600,,149,4.0
4637442,5,B0059XTU1S,"I've been a fan of Middle Earth for several years now and have looked forward to the release of all of the movies. At first I was disappointed when I learned the Hobbit was to be turned into three movies but now I'm excited and pleased by the prospect of three movies. For one thing it will give three more opportunities to visit the movie version of Middle Earth.

This particular set of discs has something for everybody; the 3D version is effective and I found myself dodging a burning pinecone as it flew at my head. The Blu-Ray 2D version and the DVD also have excellent audio and video and are each enjoyable in their own way.

One feature that I particularly enjoyed was the Special Features disc; it is filled with fascinating shots of New Zealand and, most importantly for me, the progressive story of the making of the movie told in 10 production videos hosted by Peter Jackson. The videos carry the process of producing the movie from the pre-production phase, through the production and post-production phases to the world premier in New Zealand. If you've ever wondered what all of those people with strange titles do then you have a chance to not only see what they do but to meet some of them as well. I was filled with a new respect for the incredible effort required to produce a movie like the Hobbit and get it to the screen!

It was fun and very entertaining to watch and I recommend it along with the movie itself. I look forward even more to movies two and three!

The blue-glowing mini sword, and the golum character, and many other scenes were fun to watch.  But some of my favorite events in 'the Hobbit' were downplayed or ignored, and I didn't like that.

It's supposed to be energetic and exciting and funny. (On that note, Martin Freeman is an excellent choice to play the young Bilbo Baggins.) But the movie is at all times dark and ominous, like LotR.

It's quite sad to say that I didn't enjoy it. I would rate myself among the most enthusiastic of Tolkien fans. I just think that the ""LotR approach"" was the wrong one to apply to this movie.",1367625600,,688,4.333333333333333

If this was an unknown movie or author, I would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes of ABSOLUTE boredom. But when the journey began, it was the most delightful adventure that exceeded my expectations visually and story-wise.

4637493,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is a great movie! It starts out with the same Bilbo Baggins from LOTR telling the story. The use of the same actor is very important to me. To the credit of Peter Jackson, he used a young Bilbo who could very well age to the same looks as the old Bilbo. Fantastic job in this regard.

The animation of Smaug is fantastic! I can hardly wait to see all of his glory in the next movie.

Some things I'm not too sure about is the introduction of the albino Orc. I'm not sure where this concept came from as if the book did not have enough going on. I understand the need for an enemy, but this enemy really came out of no where when compared to the book. With that said, the inclusion of this character did not take away from the movie. It basically made a central theme driving the dwarves and Bilbo through the adventure.

Additionally, the introduction of the necromancer was also outside of the book. However, with the evil things going on in the movie and the book it gave some explanation to certain things not explained in the book.

As always, Peter Jackson put together a fantastic fantasy in this movie. The entire storyline, including the added events, draw the viewer into the lands of middle earth. If I had one negative thing to say about the movie it would be that I wish they would have done this movie before LOTR. This is purely for flow and not because of contradictory elements within the movie. In fact, there are many references to events seen in LOTR.

In all, great movie! I can hardly wait until the second one comes out and the extended versions hit the shelves. It will be on my must buy list!",1367452800,,1651,4.347402597402597

This movie is as good, if not better, than the others. Whoever said it was slow and plodding must suffer from some sort of hyper activity disorder because it was chocked full of action. The works of Tolkien are extremely involved and, if you are a fan of his works, you not only don't mind the details in the movie, you enjoy them tremendously. I highly enjoyed the movie and am very excited to not only see the next two in the series but to purchase. The details are so amazing, you can watch these multiple times just to catch all the things you missed in previous viewings. Acting is also top notch. I also enjoyed the way this was tied into the LOTR films. Of course, this is just my opinion and everybody has their own. I paid to watch it and would pay again.

4637522,3,B0059XTU1S,"It is unfortunate when a great story is ruined by someone changing it to tell their own version. That is basically what has happened in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit.

While I understand the desire to weave extra material in to fill out the background of the story, the way it was done really ruined a charming story. This version takes the story and tries to force it into the mold of an action film rather than an adventure. Having listened to and unabridged audio version recently I can confirm there is plenty of action in the story, but not ridiculous things like riding on stone giants knees and getting smashed, or 15 fighting off a 100,000+ orcs while running across bridges and falling thousands of feet without hardly even a scratch. Of course I don't expect complete realism, but this is over the top.

Then there is the grudge between Thorin and the orc and Radagast(who adds NOTHING to the story). Neither of these add substance to the story and I found them very annoying.

Overall rather than being drawn in by the story I found myself wondering how many more unbelievable sequences they will do just for the 3d effect value and checking my watch to see how much was left.",1367366400,,1184,4.5754716981132075

What I liked
1. Beautiful cinematography
2. Decent action scenes and awesome special effects
But so what!!?? So many movies nowadays have this! Isn't everybody tired of movies that disregard good dialogue and acting for as much action and special effects as it is possible to fit into a movie!?

What I didn't like
1. The ridiculously stupid brown wizard or whatever and his kooky hat and rabbit sled. Is he supposed to be on shrooms? What the hell does this have to do with The Hobbit!?
2. All the added in subplots. The White Orc and his revenge on the dwarves....ummm ok....ya
3. The corny jokes that just make the movie feel more fake than it already is. We're already watching a fantasy based movie. Why make it more unrealistic and completely take the viewer out of the movie with lame jokes the characters say when there is absolutely no reason they should be coming up with ""clever"" jokes in the first place. STUPID

So disappointed. Huge fan of the LOTR trilogy. I was looking forward to this for a long time. The Hobbit is possibly my favorite book I've ever read.

Which isn't necessarily a bad thing - that's how the source material reads and there's plenty of room in the genre - but it seems to be internally conflicted about that. It's constantly stretching and reaching for more serious, grandiose moments which seem out of place and extraneous. For the most part, though, it strikes the right chords and delivers a jolly, magical adventure that's plenty of fun to tag along with... even if it does grow long-winded in spots. As an audio-visual showcase, though, it never stumbles. From sweeping landscape to stunning vista, breathtaking architectural relics to disgusting subterranean creatures, it runs a vast gamut and never ceases to amaze. For that reason alone, it's worth a long glimpse. The plot does seem overstuffed and more than a little long, but it still feels like there was enough material here to justify three films, which was a concern going in.

4637584,5,B0059XTU1S,"It's hard not to be skeptical of Peter Jackson's decision to stretch the shortest of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth Books _The Hobbit_ into three movies when he was able to cover the entire _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy in the same number of films.  It should be obvious that the short novel is going to endure some padding if Jackson wants to stretch it across three movies entitled THE HOBBIT, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG and THERE AND BACK AGAIN.  How you feel about Jackson's depiction of Middle Earth will determine how much you like this movie.

I have seen some critics complain that this movie drags.  I myself was delighted to see the characters never seen in the _The Hobbit_ but only referred to in the book.  (Possible Spoilers Ahead!). I rejoiced to see old friends at Rivendale like Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchette as Galadrial, and Christopher Lee as the future traitor Saruman the White.
Radaghast the Brown's debut presentation was curious but it was satisfying to see the Necromancer and the Witch King of Angmar at Don Gul Dur in a scene only hinted at in the novel.

I believe that described it in a nutshell.  If you enjoy seeing scenes of the  fantastic come to life you will enjoy this padding and gobble it up like cotton candy and look forward to the next helping.  If all you care about is action and a race to the conclusion this movie might weigh on you like a plate of greasy corndogs and seem to drag.

I highly recommend the blu-ray 3D version if you have the capability to watch 3D (which I do) but even the DVD version is well worth the watch, as this brings back many of the original characters from ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" and also introduces many new ones, including Gimly's father, who is part of the 13 adventurers in this tale.

I decided to watch it again, with now lower expectations, in the interest of giving it a fair shake. And honestly, I liked it much better the second time.
There are parts I still don't like, and I feel like the movie really suffers from a lack of direction, and particularly not really knowing who its main character is. In the Lord of the Rings it worked much better when they followed separate stories of Aragorn, Frodo, and Merry & Pippin. In the Hobbit I would have much preferred for the focus to be on, well- the hobbit.
That said, I think the scenes that do focus on Bilbo, particularly the beginning, and the Riddles scene are brilliant.
For the most part the rest is learning to take the good with the bad and deal with what you have.
I would recommend watching it once or probably twice before condemning this film entirely.",1366934400,,1111,4.346153846153846

4637632,1,B0059XTU1S,"I am a very avid fan of all of Jackson's LOTR movies.  They were superbly executed, in my humble opinion.

When The Hobbit came out, my friends and family went to see the movie at the theater.  ""It's great!"" they said, ""you'll love it!"" they said.  Turns out, my suspicious were horrendously accurate.

The Hobbit is a child's movie - and, I guess, to be fair it was a child's book so that fits.

What I WASN'T prepared for was the sheer ineptitude of the acting and the almost monotone cast of characters.  I mean - let's face it, there IS a limit on how many of us out there actually want to watch a 3.5-hr long movie about a band of grumpy dwarves.  But - okay, I thought, I'll give it a go.

The first inkling that something was very wrong with this movie was during the ""prologue"" section of the film (which is long-winded and boring, and has graphics that quite frankly are no better than the LOTR trilogy's).  When it portrays the dragon Smaug decimating the dwarves' city, it did not give one actually gripping shot of the dragon.  All we saw were fire explosions, and a hint of a tail here or a big claw there.  I mean - I'm sorry.  This is Peter Jackson.  He created the movie versions of the dragons the Ringwraiths ride on, and everything!  I found that VERY anticlimactic and cheap.

Then we enter into the ""setting the scene"" bit of the movie, where we are introduced to Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf.  There is absolutely ZERO chemistry between these two on-screen, and it shows.  Bilbo is an obnixious old hobbit who wanders around his burrow grumbling and setting things straight all the time.  He has as much charisma as my left pinky finger.

Then - oh GOD then.  THEN the dwarves appear.  Just randomly - like knock-at-the-door oh-look-its-a-dwarf random.  So like 13 of the little buggers all descend upon Bilbo's house, have a feast, eat all his food, Gandalf shows up, produces a magic key, ominous dark dwarf prince leader shows up, they break into song twice, do a stupid little routine where they clear up the feat plates and cutlery - and that's it.  My toes were literally curled in a cringe throughout 98% of this scene.

And then - after about an hour or so of movie, Bilbo finally gets is hiney out the door and runs after the dwarves.  We are supposed to believe that this cantankerous, grumpy, introverted old hobbit wakes up the morning after the feast, and has a sudden attack of conscience, and decides to do something with his life.  Mmmmkay - fair enough.

The rest of the movie is your standard cringe-worthy action-fantasy-adventure.  The scene with the three trolls belongs in Shrek or something - not a LOTR movie.  I felt like I was watching the Three Stooges combined with Laurel and Hardy.  Even Hugo Weaving as Lord Elrond falls flat.  I mean - that is something no-one should EVER.  HAVE.  TO.  SEE.

So - dwarves visit elves, elves give a little help, Galadriel smiles, they fight on an open plain with wolf-mounted goblins, blah blah blah.  Oh - and there's this REALLY odd man-mountain bit where we watch two rock-mountain-giant-leviathan-things punch each other's heads off while the party cling to their legs.  Yeah.

I'm not even going to touch the rabbit-sled-forest-wizard with a ten foot bargepole.......I do believe that you had to be smoking something to understand all that.......and enjoy it.

The ONLY redeeming piart of this movie comes at the touching moment between Bilbo and the dwarf prince (no idea what his name was), when Bilbo satiates the dwarf's hatred towards the lazy hobbit by telling him that he has a home to go back to, but the dwarves don't - and so that's why he is helping them.

What a shame.",1366934400,3,3670,4.584615384615384

He's the spitting image of the older Bilbo in The Fellowship of the Ring, and you can really tell that he and Merry and Pippin are related because he bears a strong resemblance to both of them at times!

4637648,1,B0059XTU1S,"If you were a fan of the book The Hobbit then this is not the movie for you. As the beginning episode to an extended LOTR series then it is but ok. In short it falls way short of the extreme care used in producing that amazing trilogy.
You will probably remember hearing throughout the specials associated with the LOTR series EVERYONE saying how much they respected the books and the author and made every effort to conform their product to that high standard. Well the people rapidly interviewed for the ""Features"" disc of this piece do not even mention either the book or the author-with good reason. Actually the features portion does not even begin to measure up to the materials carried in the commentaries and extras associated with the LOTR series. Those were an exercise and primer in film making and very interesting and informative.

The features associated with this effort are no more than the usual fluff one finds associated with other ""extras"" discs with any DVD. In addition one is conducted through them at breakneck speed. Were the guides late for lunch or some such thing?

It is a shame that the screen writers and director did not continue the superior bit which is contained in this show throughout the production. That is the scenes between Gollum and Bilbo are superb! A truly first rate job by both actors and their support crews behind the scenes. All the other stuff seems to boil down to marathon run through a gazillion Orcs by a bunch of overgrown clowns disguised as dwarfs-poor script writing indeed.
Jackson is quoted as saying he didn't want to do this piece initially. He should have stuck with his first impression. What good are 3D and 48fps if the basic product is low grade. Those bells and whistles are not sufficient to make a bad product acceptable.",1366848000,2,1792,4.703821656050955

Either way, It's a good watch.
I recommend.
Martin Freeman did a good job impersonating Bilbo. Radagast... RADAGAST *fangirl screech*
They did leave out some scenes from the book that i would have been glad to see/ would solve bilions of non readers' questions (i.e. ""Why don't the Giant Eagles take them all the way"" if you read Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire it will answer that plainly).
Other than that, the special features will make you wish you lived in New Zeland. The cinemotography and locations are amazing, the new way of filming makes it feel like you are the Fourteenth honorary member of the party, I need to see it in 3D so idk about that.

But try to keep this franchise mature, you'll ruin it if you try to make this appeal to kids.",1366848000,,328,4.290322580645161
4637652,4,B0059XTU1S,"Curiously enough, the trilogy The Lord of the Rings seemed to me like Tolkien's second attempt at The Hobbit; now The Hobbit is Peter Jackson's second attempt at The Lord of the Rings.

At first glance the thing that hit me immediately was the incredible attention to detail at every turn. I'm sure The Lord of the Rings had a similar attention to detail, but perhaps seeing The Hobbit on a better screen made me more aware. The filmmakers left nothing to chance like they did with The Lord of the Rings;  I had the distinct impression that they knew what they were doing this time. The script was thoughtful and the visual effects were honestly stunning; light years ahead of the somewhat cumbersome work in its predecessors. I'll probably never tire of watching the wind ripple through the CGI feathers of the eagles in the final scenes.

The casting is excellent. Through the movie's nearly three hour run time I didn't notice a spot of bad acting. I'll never forgive Viggo Mortensen's horrific acting, or Liv Tyler's; Even Elijah Wood with his iridescent eyes was bland. In contrast, Martin Freeman as Bilbo was a streak of genus and I don't wonder at Jackson's persistence in getting him to accept the part. The thirteen dwarfs are in a category of their own. Peter Jackson put off making the Hobbit for so long because of the dwarfs; it was going to be a little like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, only worse. I was frankly lost in the novel what with Filis and Kilis, Gloins and Oins running about in an unordered mass.  Fortunately, the wait paid off; each of the dwarfs has a distinct personality and appearance, breaking into little pieces the rule that all dwarfs must be fat, dumpy and ugly. The fan girls must be pleased.

When I first read The Hobbit back when I was twelve, I was disappointed. The plot seemed a little pointless; it appeared that it was just a pack of greedy dwarfs off to take back a treasure that wasn't entirely theirs (killing the dragon wasn't even in the mix). In the film (actually, I shouldn't call it that) a new meaning has been infused, there's more at stake than the gold, and adding the subplots from the appendices (which I have not read) is extremely intriguing.

Of course with all its strong points, there are weak points as well. Like The Lord of the Rings the thing moves slowly in places and the battle scenes are often excessive and less than believable. I don't mind a few dead enemies, but our heroes plow through hundreds of them in a death defying manner and come out without a scratch at the other end (their swords are still shiny, too). I understand they have to leave the blood out in order to keep it PG-13, but wouldn't a few high quality sword fights like what we saw in Kingdom of Heaven (I didn't like that movie, by the way) or even Pirates of the Caribbean have been better?

I watched the movie a second time (which is unusual for me), doing my own editing and ended up enjoying it even more than the first time around. There are a few scenes from The Lord of the Rings that I'll always remember; the Charge of Rohirrim, with the very earth shaking under my feet and the frankly heart rending death of Boromir, but now, I'll also be remembering the hauntingly beautiful Over the Misty Mountains Cold sung in the rumbling voices of the actors themselves.

To put it in a nutshell, I enjoyed it and I'm awaiting the next installment eagerly.",1366848000,,3410,4.515397082658023
4637653,5,B0059XTU1S,"This is my favorite book and I was not disappointed with the film.  The producers even used additional references from the supplementary notes in the LOTR novels.  I can't wait for the rest of the trilogy!  As with any book-turned-movie, there were some minor differences, but it was a closer portrayal of the original.",1366848000,,319,4.87037037037037
4637654,3,B0059XTU1S,"Perhaps I'm just tired of what seems like the same thing over and over with this movie. All the villains look exactly the same with no hair and no cloths to start with. It's a dozen little guys taking on thousands of monster villains and winning all the time, even though it's luck or some weird unbelievable intervention that does the trick for them.
The movie is just really long for no good reason, as they focus on very small themes that take a long time to make happen, and have no real significance in the film; like the dinner that takes forever to make the point of simply bringing them all together. My point is the editing wasn't very good from an entertainment point of view, but very good if this was a documentary.

ONLY ONE SINGLE girl in the entire film and she has no real part especially. Once again all men, killing everything they touch and blood everywhere is the central theme. I just get tired of this.
I don't mean to preach but, this world goes down and down in so many ways, and giving our society a steady never ending dose of violence, day in and day out doesn't help one bit, and in fact it hurts this society more than anyone thinks. We're the most violent nation in the world, killing millions for ""peaceful reasons"" of course. LOL What a joke huh.

Couldn't they have made just one tiny part a love story, or something good happening along the way to at least add some balance, rather than non-stop mayhem? It would have been nice, but in this peaceful land of America...I guess it'll never happen, because people love killing here, and love to see it everyday to the exclusion of everything else, until finally they don't even notice it anymore and fail to even see it's consequences......Like the people that read this, that will love this film, and let their children watch it a hundred times as they wonder what happened to this society, failing to see they contribute to it, every single day.",1366848000,,1928,4.49002849002849

4637656,1,B0059XTU1S,"I'm afraid I cannot comment on the entire 'movie' due to the fact that I could only tolerate it through the ghastly Troll scene. But here goes.
While the 'movie' did not start out following the book in the very beginning, it did a terrific job of setting the stage for the adventure that followed by laying out the historical groundwork.  Despite the occasional quotes from the book and the odd blunder into accuracies here and there (I believe that was Weathertop in the background right before the Troll incident), the movie makes a most unfortunate turn into the dark side.  The trolls didn't act as they did in the book and the purse didn't talk and Gandalf made them argue amongst themselves while the morning sun rose (in the book).  To say nothing of throwing the unfortunate Radagast under the bus in an earlier segment.  Peter made him look like a rum-soaked half wit bleeding heart tree hugger bereft of any power save that of making us all laugh.
Sorry folks, but that was as much as I could tolerate of the shredding of a most noble story.  I hit the eject button and pondered the value of grinding the offending disk into silver dust.  Truth be told, I generally would prefer to eat a book than read it (sorry Worf) but when I picked up the Trilogy and later the Hobbit (yes, backwards, but it worked out just as well) in 1976 just to silence my college friends, I was instantly transformed into a world I would never ever tire of.  What I saw last night was the pillaring of an old friend and I had not the stomach for it.  I dearly wanted to see Elrond and Smaug and the battle of 5 Armies and riddles in the dark but Peter had other ideas.",1366848000,8,1655,4.368078175895765

4637736,2,B0059XTU1S,"5 stars for makeup, wardrobe, props, sets and special effects.
5 stars for quality of Blu-ray transfer.

2 stars for the film, its screenplay, content and themes. I was emotionally exhausted and empty after watching this film. There was nothing to reflect upon afterward, emotionally or intellectually. It didn't even fall into the ""fun"" films category like Beetlejuice, Rango or Depp's Alice in Wonderland. The frenzied pace of non-stop action begins within the first few minutes when the dwarves show up for dinner and continues without respite for the remainder of the film until the credits roll. The overwhelming bulk of this is back-to-back chase and battle scenes weilding axes, arrows and swords. It's the cinema version of the World of Warcraft MMPOG - emphasis on ""massive."" The utterly unnecessarily complex screenplay is grossly bloated to create the first in a planned trilogy of full length feature films from a single, medium length novel. The novel's major underlying ""Bildungsroman"" themes - Bilbo Baggins' evolution - achieving worldly maturity through overcoming the trials of his journey - with his growth in understanding and grappling with the struggle between egocentrism and greed versus altruism - are completely lost - reducing it to nothing more than a fantasy action film on amphetamines.

LOTR needed to be a trilogy to adequately cover Tolkein's 3 novels. The Hobbit novel could have - and should have - been adapted as one (likely long) feature film. But wait, that wouldn't milk the franchise cash cow that another blockbuster trilogy could with 3x or more box office receipts. The original novel is a much more worthwhile and satisfying story than this film.",1366588800,2,1691,5.1678832116788325

at first i thought i got ripped off with the bonus dvd-- because on the extras there wasn't many choices. but the blogs were great and lasted a lot longer than i thought. would have liked to see more on the making of, but i'm sure they'll bring something out later.

4637752,3,B0059XTU1S,"I really, really wanted to love this movie. Aside from being a big fan of the books, I loved Jackson's take on the trilogy and was actually intrigued by the idea of stretching this movie out into 3 via bringing in material from the Silmarillion and the Appendices, especially since he and Walsh did such a good job of adapting the other books.

I just can't bring myself to really enjoy this movie on the level I enjoyed the LoTR trilogy, and I really have a hard time summing up exactly why. The pacing of the film is the easiest thing to put my thumb on for why I'm struggling to adore it - the film felt rather like nonstop drama after awhile, to the point I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant fight scenes, especially when they were 'amped up' from the book. This is odd to me, since I bought into those with Fellowship.

My biggest issue, honestly, is Thorin and how the story and writers handle him. I like Thorin just fine. His actor does a good job, his design is great, and so on - but my god does this movie make him seem like he's the most important dwarf ever. These elements wouldn't even bug me much had they been introduced more slowly, or as Bilbo got to know Thorin...but right from that first introduction shot of him coming into Bilbo's home, I kind of rolled my eyes a little.

The overemphasis on Thorin went from kind of amusing to grating very quickly, especially since the film can't seem to decide who its main character is. Bilbo, in this first film, really doesn't seem to matter, and the ""Thorin Oakenshield is super important and has personal vendettas and so on"" line of writing just seemed rather like bad fanfic after awhile, and it grated. When the final climatic showdown came I just sighed and rolled my eyes at it. Of course they changed that scene to be about Thorin. Couldn't have the original scene of them all nearly burning to death, could we?

All of that said though, there's a lot to love here. They did a really good job of giving all of the dwarves distinct looks and personalities, the visuals, cinematography and design are rich as ever, and the cast all look and act their parts wonderfully. The plot threads they introduced from the extended sources will be interesting to see play out, and I'm definitely going to be going to see the next film.

Those expectations started to fade early, as the narration droned on and on and on for events that I felt could easily be shown by action and acting instead.
Once the 'action' started it moved at a plodding pace. When things finally got going, sometimes I was taken out of it by the ridiculous circumstances, like the huge subterranean, cavernous, rickety, Rube Goldberg constructions. They seemed designed to cause great harm to anyone foolish enough to set foot on them.

4637780,5,B0059XTU1S,"Jackson blends material that Tolkien came up with later back into the story to make it more of a prequel to the LoTR trilogy.  With the extra material, the length is extended beyond that of the original ""Hobbit"" book.  I was expecting the worst, but I was actually pleased with the outcome and look forward to the next.  It is not something that parents should take young kids to expecting the original tale, as it has more gruesome fights and swordplay than LoTRs had.

The UltraViolet Flixter is a joke.  I tried to install it 4 times and never succeeded. You download a 423 kb ""flixtersetup.exe file and then waste your time.  Once you run this for the ""install,"" it begins the real download.  At first it said that it had to download 15.6 mb.  As it approached 15.6, it upped to 16.6.  As it approached 16.6, it jumped to 36.6.  As it approached 36.6 it jumped to 47.6.  When it approached 47.6 mb of download, it came up and said that the validity check was bad and it stopped.  It did the exact same thing 4 times.

If you want to play it on a portable device, just find DVD43 for any protection, copy the DVD to your hard drive and use Handbrake or a similar program to rip it to a format of your choice.

4637782,5,B0059XTU1S,It is the most awesome movie that I have seen in quite a while.  I have watched it numerous times since I got it.,1366502400,,113,3.7083333333333335
4637783,5,B0059XTU1S,Although the movie is long and starts slow for some I feel the length is necessary for us to fall in love with the dwarves and Bilbo.  The movie stays true to the overall story and theme of the book.  I wish it was not going to be in three separate movies but I will get over that.  There are the breath taking sweeping scenes we come to expect from Peter Jackson.  Intense story lines and fun characters.  I recommend this movie to Tolkien lovers and movie lovers alike.,1366502400,,471,4.247191011235955
4637784,5,B0059XTU1S,Great show and looks absolutely fantastic on our Sony. Would recommend this movie to anyone who likes adventure. Can't wait for the next one to come out.,1366502400,,153,4.703703703703703
4637785,4,B0059XTU1S,"First off, the resolution/visual aspect of this movie is AMAZING. I'm extremely sensitive to the SOE (Soap Opera Effect), and I was dreading this movie, based on the fact that Jackson filmed it at 60 frames per second, and it was widely reported to look ""like a BBC low budget program"". Fortunately, this is not the case. I have no idea what Jackson did, but this looks absolutely incredible (even more so than LOTR), and there is no SOE whatsoever that I could detect. This is probably the most visually dynamic movie I've ever seen... it simply ""pops"" off of the screen in an incredible fashion. I watched it on Blu-ray, no 3d, on a 1080p 47"" LG. Not sure if the refresh rate of my own TV impacted the ultimate delivery of the movie (it's essentially a 60Hz, though it's advertised as 120Hz ""TruMotion""), but I would certainly recommend all viewers adjust their TVs to 60Hz if they are sensitive to the SOE, like me- the results will take your breath away.

This movie deserves props for some truly inventive notions brought to life, such as a crazed woodland wizard riding about on a sleigh pulled by giant rabits, an elf lord traipsing about on a moose (or elk?), and one of the most incredibly goblin riots of all time. However, much like ""Pan's Labrynth"", I'm not sure if you ever want your kids to watch this one, unless you fancy the notion of them waking up screaming in the middle of the night... there are some terrifying creatures in this movie that will haunt the lil' ones' dreams, most notable being the orc chief and the goblin king (not sure if those are their proper titles, but you get the idea). The goblin king, in particular, is an extremely disturbing critter that shows off some amazing CG chops by whoever created him. And of courser, Gollum is back, and he's perhaps freakier than ever, and more than enough to instill nightmares all by his lonesome.

What came as a great surprise to me was that (young) Bilbo Baggins was so likable. In fact, he's FAR more likable than Frodo was in the LOTR series. Frodo spent most of his movies whining and crying, all whilst he twisted his face into an agonized visage, just in case you weren't sure of how miserable he was. I realize he drew a short straw, but when compared to Bilbo, he seems like an irredeemable crybaby. Instead of complaining and lamenting his fate, Bilbo embraces his unwanted quest and barrels into it with a headfull of steam, embracing those who doubt and dislike him. He's kind, generous, and irrepressible, and this turns him into the most lovable protagonist that has ever graced a LOTR film.

I only knock off one star for some pacing issues (which has become something of Jackson's hallmark). However, rest assured- if you're an LOTR nerd (and I know there's a LOT of you out there), you will love this movie like nobody's business, and it will be a five star must-buy for you. For me, however, the movie dragged too much in the middle, and it actually felt like a three hour movie, as opposed to something like ""The Avengers"" or the Batman movies, which were more aggressively paced, and didn't feel like three hours to me (relax, LOTR nerds, it's just my opinion).

Nonetheless, this is a fantastic fantasy film, by any measure. Watch it in HD, turn it up, join the dwarves, and begin your own ""Unexpected Journey""!",1366502400,,3312,4.580101180438448
4637786,2,B0059XTU1S,"This movie wouldn't have been bad if it were an hour and a half long. Almost 3 hours is ridiculous and pretentious. This isn't an assignment, there was no need or requirement to make this 3 hours long, especially when there was no point to doing so. I think it was much better than the past Lord of the Ring movies, but at a certain point, you could tell that all the actors were exhausted and the movie began to lose focus. If I had one wish, it would be for the next movies to come in under 2 hours long. Almost 3 hours without a point is just pushing it. The LOTR movies suffer from the same problem as the Harry Potter films. There is absolutely no point to making them ridiculously long. The audience doesn't benefit, it is more work for the film makers, and theaters can't turn over showings as often. Furthermore, casual fans will simply not bother. A great movie with a great plot can be 3 hours long. This shouldn't be. It has no business being so. In the editing process, a director should see that a film is dragging and start cutting scenes. Peter Jackson is NOT a bad film maker. I've seen his other films, which were fantastic. I have no idea why with LOTR, he is fixated with lengthening the time out?

Hopefully, this will change after the somewhat lackluster reviews of the last film, but it's doubtful. I think critics and audiences just figured out what I noticed about the first film, which I walked out of.",1366502400,,1427,4.364661654135339

Think about any ONE of the ""Lord"" flicks...clear image of place, characters, moments, motivations, lost opportunities, but hope above all...right?  ""The Hobbit"" simply capitalizes on the Tolkien name without meeting the requirements of the Tolkien brand.  In other words, it's a cheap and easy way to make a few car payments for Peter Jackson, the studio, and the crew.  We deserve better, and Jackson and those kids have done better.  'Two stars' because the scenery is grand and the actors showed up.

Really, you don't at all need to see this if you're trying to fill in any of the holes Tolkien left in his saga. Holes are GOOD: the medieval teller of tales - which I guess Tolkien was - wants the listeners to fill in those holes themselves...so that they'll be engaged and committed to the ultimate resolution of the conflict. Skin in the game.  Saga and myth are not spectator sports.

So, save yourself 4 bucks.  If you don't want to read more Tolkien, well, then, just pour yourself some mead, close your eyes, and let loose the dragons and dwarves in your imagination.  You'll do better than ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"".",1366502400,,1377,4.743697478991597

Peter Jackison's adaptation of the Ring is one of the greatest achievements in cinema.  The Hobbit?  One can quibble with lots of things - he's gone beyond the book itself to consult the various appendices from the whole body of Tolkien's work.  Will it be worth three movies?  I'm under his spell, and thoroughly enjoyed this first installment.  He has the perfect Bilbo in Martin Freeman, and the Darves are equally fine.

4637859,2,B0059XTU1S,"Just finished watching this and was very disappointed. The Hobbit was a major book for me as a kid and seeing it treated as though it wasn't good enough for a movie was pretty tough. Within the first few seconds, the movie frames itself as a narration by Future Bilbo, thus notifying the viewer that Bilbo is never in any danger at any point in the story.

A great deal of effort is spent alluding to the LOTR trilogy of movies in an obvious, distracting way. While I was not happy to see this self-serving behavior, it was at least understandable - they want to sell DVDs. What was more confusing were numerous sequences of events from the past, illustrating or sometimes just replacing a character who is telling a story. Invariably, these past events are far more exciting, and hint at a much more interesting Middle Earth, than anything depicted in the current timeline of the movie. The end result was as if this movie was spliced together with clips from a much better movie which will never be made.

Huge sweeping liberties are taken with various characters, Radagast the Brown being a notable example. Can't wait to see what Beorn is like in the second movie!

During the scenes that the movie condescends to share with the actual book, perplexing changes are made to character dialogue, in ways which don't help to tell the story but rather serve only to dilute the language. This is not a trivial criticism; Tolkien was a scholar of languages and used language in dialogue in a very specific way to help describe the personality of his characters. To alter the diction of, e.g. the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum, is to fundamentally change the story of what happened between those two characters in that cave. Bilbo is changed from quivering with fear to confident and a bit testy. And this is a scene which, in relative terms, came pretty much straight from the text.

More difficult to judge are scenes which never happened anywhere in print, including in the later-released material from Tolkien's notes discussing the background for the story. Much of this material is simply filler, giving the very clear impression that the filmmakers have nine hours to tell this story and intend to use every second of it whether they need to or not.

I paid $1.50 to borrow this Blu-Ray from RedBox and I think that was about the right price for the experience. It's a very pretty movie with swords and monsters and lots of action, so there is entertainment value, but it's not really The Hobbit.

It's The Hobbit as told from memory by a hyperactive six-year-old.",1366329600,39,2574,4.696230598669623

It was never clear if I was watching an action adventure or a BBC Comedy. One scene would be an intimate connection between characters with classic scenery and another had a cartoonish goblin king falling on top on Dwarves after one of them said, ""We'll that could have been worse"".

4637903,5,B0059XTU1S,"This won't be a review as much as it will be an explanation as to why the critics are wrong.

Critics,  Peter Jackson expanded this into THREE MOVIES!!  Did you actually come into this expecting to see ""The Hobbit"" alone?  Well if you did,  that was a mistake.  When I first saw this in theaters I too was doing the whole,  ""That's not how they did it in the book!  That's different!  I don't like different!""  But then I remembered how much of Middle Earth PJ was planning to put into this,  so I forced myself to stop looking for mistakes and judge the movie for what it is.  And you know what?  Not only did I enjoy the movie,  but I wanted more.

I know a lot of you think that expanding the movie was just a money grab,  but I think you're forgetting something. That Something being that Peter Jackson is GEEK.  100%,  unadulterated Geek.  Can you guess the movies target audience?  If you guessed ""Geeks"",  give yourself a cookie.  I guarantee you that had The Hobbit been created BEFORE the Lord of The Rings trilogy,  we would have had a more ""faithful"" adaptation. I will agree that he made an error in making LOTR first.  It set the bar far too high,  and the Hobbit,  while wonderful all on its own,  could not rise to the challenge of satisfying an army of salivating Tolkien geeks.  It just couldn't  It would only serve to whet their appetites.

Many also criticize the tone of the movie,  or rather the lack of  steadiness of it.  That's one of the few things that stayed true the book!!  Tolkien himself made the book with light hearted, childish and immature moments,  and then threw in some pretty mature,  scary,  sad,  even gruesome moments.  I remember being taken off guard the first time I read it and didn't know what to think.  But I believe it's one of the things that made The Hobbit such a classic in the first place.

All that said,  I will admit that this movie is flawed and I didn't appreciate all the changes,  such as tweaking the Troll scene,  how Thorin was so whiny,  or  the fact that their mission changed from simple greed to the more noble ""taking back the homeland"" clich.  But through it all the spirit of The Hobbit stayed the same,  and I loved every minute of it.  I can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug!!!

edit:  Just showed this movie to my four hyper-active no attention span nieces and nephews,  Ages 11-6 years old.  Not only did they sit through it,  but the 10 year old said ""It's the best show I ever saw!""  I was not expecting that.  I guess this movie reaches a larger demographic then I originally thought!",1366243200,,2576,4.3752665245202556
4637904,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great movie! It is true to the book, and though they do add some characters and embellish on the Azog the Defiler (the pale orc) plot line that's only briefly mentioned in the book, I enjoyed what they added! The Hobbit (book), though wonderful, can be slow at times, and there's a lot of walking and descriptions and songs. If they had stuck to the book exactly, they would not have had enough to make a full three movies (which is their plan, as ""An Unexpected Journey"" is only the first in the series).

The scenery was beautiful, and I loved the song that the dwarfs sing in the beginning about the Misty Mountains! Though it was a very long movie, it was fast paced and interesting enough to not be boring. It was also not as violent or morbid as the Lord of the Rings movies (though the King Goblin was pretty disgusting!). If I was going to be really picky, I would say that it bothered me how the goblins and orcs looked different from the goblins and orcs in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and that some of the dwarfs seemed a little overdone and unrealistic, I mean... the starfish hair is cool and all... but still...

It was also a very funny movie! There were a lot of parts that made me laugh, which was unexpected! The part with Gollum in the cave is very well done, though he loses his ring the wrong way.

All in all, The Hobbit was a great movie! I re-read the book afterwards, and pictured Martin Freeman as Bilbo this time, which I liked because I'd always had a hard time picturing Bilbo, and now I had a better idea of what he looked like. If you liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy books or movies I would definitely recommend The Hobbit! Though there are some differences from the book by J.R.R Tolkien, it doesn't really make the movie less enjoyable! :)",1366243200,2,1818,4.325513196480938
4637905,3,B0059XTU1S,"The production values are astonishing...visually, one of the best 3D movies I've seen. The story, however...well, let's put it this way: the LOTR was an 1,800-page trilogy. The movie editions were so long they caused bladder damage at the theater, but that was understandable because there was a LOT of storytelling to be done: Peter Jackson needed 9, 10, 12 hours (depending on which special edition you bought) to get the job done.

The Hobbit, on the other hand, is a 250-page book assembled from JRRT's bedtime stories for his kids. It takes about three and a half hours for an adult to power through the pages. Round One of Jackson's vision took two hours and 45 minutes of screen time. What does this mean? While there are some fun sections--the race to escape the orc cavern is madness!--a significant amount of that sumptuous visual detail is vacuous fluff or--worse--stuff Peter Jackson flat-out made up.

And there are two more films yet to go!  I will, eventually, buy this or the extended verion (!), but I'm not going to feel good about myself when I do.",1366243200,2,1067,4.725806451612903

4637913,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit is a project that people have been waiting for for years now. There's been a lot of bluster about the movie being split into three parts, the high frame rate, new characters, and the critic's resolution was that the movie was a disappointment. As a Tolkien fan, I'd been keeping an eye on the movie's progress and worried over how it would turn out.
And I knew as soon as I heard the first line I knew that I needn't have worried.
This movie brings us back to familiar faces and places of The Lord of the Rings, yet brings us a more cheerful, family-friendly tale and crew, but still manages to bring in some of the moving, profound moments that made us love LOTR. And finally, people get to see what Bilbo, the kindly but slightly odd older gentlehobbit we remember from the LOTR trilogy has to offer. And Martin Freeman does a great job of bringing Bilbo to life. All of the other characters, including the dwarves, have an awesome family vibe to them; the scene in Bag End reminds me of various birthday parties my family has had throughout the years. Each of the dwarves gets their own, individual personalities, something the book didn't give us. Although in places the story line has been altered slightly, it still comes off reminding you of the fun, childlike book. We also have more of the epic score, and various nods to the trilogy are made in the movie. I know this has actually been the complaint of some, that there's too much of LOTR in The Hobbit. Well, both books were written by the same person, sometimes with the same characters, in the same world. Some of the things are going to be similar. And I, personally, like the little run on jokes.
On a note about ordering it, the DVD was accurately priced, and arrived on the day the movie came out, since I pre-ordered.
Since the next movie in the trilogy doesn't come out until December 2013, I'm glad that I have this DVD to tide me over until then.

In fact, much of the movie feels recycled from the earlier trilogy using the same dramatic devices.  It neither satisfies as an adult adventure with its excessively long dining, fighting and chase scenes nor is it suitable as a children's' tale with its graphic animated violence.  The only fresh adventure aspect is the introduction of mountain monsters who are engaged in an unexplained combat.  The one redeeming scene in the movie is the exquisitely acted interchange between the elf princess Lorien (Kate Blanchett) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen).

In the theatre this movie was a 3 star in my opinion as there was just to much to process in one viewing. Now that i have it at home (borrowed) i may have to consider buying it. There is just so much happening in this film i wish they could have figured out a way to tell this story with some better details and it not feeling so rushed after a hour into it. I would have liked more of a back story on the dwarves and let us get to know them a bit better. Same thing with the 5 wizards.  This is a good movie although it has flaws, im growing to like it alot more. One thing that LOTR has over this is the pace'ing or FLOW, thats right, Flow, it goes at a nice even pace from start to finish and through all three movies, i feel the ""flow"" of the Hobbit is all over the place. I don't suppose its a bad thing, its just not what were used to in these middle earth movies. Ive been breaking this movie into sections and watching 30 minutes to a hour each day, it makes it easier to digest and i feel like i can process what im seeing a little better  (like i have the rest of the day to chew on what ive just watched) and WOW, doing it this way there are just all kinds of details jumping out all over the place at me that i didn't get at the theatre.  This is a good movie, just take your time with it.

My main complaint is that the relative short story of the book is being made into three different films. In Jackson's three films on the Lord of the Rings, it made sense to make three films since there were based on three book, The Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers and the Return of the King. However, the book The Hobbit is smaller in size than anyone of the books in the Lord of the Ring series and it is being broken up in three pictures.",1366156800,,599,4.172413793103448

4637959,3,B0059XTU1S,"For young guys who like that sort of thing, I'm sure the interminable battle scenes were terrific, but I would have liked to have seen more balance.  By the end of the movie, I still knew the names of only 4 of the dwarves--a bit more time spent on the characters would have been appreciated rather than the goblin scene and the later orc scene going on a bit too long.  I loved the riddle scene between Bilbo & Gollum and found the movie entertaining, but I missed having subtitles on the digital rental--I probably missed the dialogue in 1/3 of the movie, including some of the riddles. :-(

Loved Radagast the Brown, loved the elves, loved seeing Frodo...

...but I wish they had used available technology to de-age all of the characters we've seen before--it's possible (the Tron sequel, even NCIS has used it successfully), and with the budget these movies have?  There was no need for Frodo, older Bilbo, and Galadriel to look so different.  Even Bilbo's hair was different.  Only Hugo Weaving looked nearly the same.  (With Frodo, it wasn't only the face--although they did get the wig right!--it was the fact that the actor went from being a very young man to a man in his prime in the interim 10 years--the shoulders/carriage were completely different.)  These are nitpicky things--but Peter Jackson has showed himself to be a director who pays incredible attention to detail generally.

In many ways, Jackson has taken a book I always found the least interesting of the Middle Earth volumes, and turned it into a delightful, fun story that comes alive.  But I really was getting restless and ready to move on by the end of the two main battle scenes.  And I'm skeptical that one short book can be stretched into 3 films, no matter how much of the Silmarillion and the appendices he pulls into the mix (much as I love the inclusion of these).  If this movie is anything to go by, my skepticism may be justified.",1366156800,3,1920,4.628318584070796

I feel that if you know and love the Hobbit, you will love this film.  If you don't know the Hobbit, you should have different expectations, it's still a great film.

I was really wanting to like The Hobbit movie, but I hardly recognized the book in it. Yes, the story line is the same, but there are the introduction of new subplots, episodes that were done so much more charmingly in the book, and an essentially pompous, unlikable Bilbo Baggins (he was pompous but sweet in the book). For my taste, there is way too much mindless spectacle and action, and too little of the book's humor that endowed the dwarfs and hobbit with charm.

The action scenes were also quite entertaining. Not much excessive violence as I can recall. Good background story development that increases enjoyment of LOTR, and not just the obvious background story of the discovery of the Ring.

I mainly took off one star just for the length. It really should have been made into a slightly longer single movie, not a trilogy. But good entertainment no doubt.",1366156800,,575,4.86734693877551

4638032,3,B0059XTU1S,"I will try to be short.

I absolutely love the LoTR trilogy movies. The hardcore fans may claim that it doesn't stay true to the book and many parts are missing, others say that movie was too long and too slowly paced, but for me it was just right.
This was not the case with the Hobbit. I understand that Jackson wanted to make more than just the ""Hobbit"" book - he wanted a complete background prequel to LoTR including lots of material from Silmarillion. I can appreciate that - the extra info, the necromancer, the elves trying to manipulate things behind dwarfs back etc.

However I must stress out that the pace of the movie doesn't quite match. The things scroll along just too fast - the entire part of chasing through goblin caves is like a Roller-coaster ride that went just a bit too fast - in fact so fast that your vision begins to blur. They really should have cut down on the chasing - its makes all the efforts to put serious tone on the darker background story to vanish into thin air and look childish.

I would really have appreciated this movie much more if not for the things mentioned.
So 4 for the works, but -1 for excessive chasing.",1366070400,,1157,4.372093023255814

The Hobbit is a slim book so I was curious how they were going to make it into three movies, well bloated over dramatic fight scenes seem to be the way. Martin Freeman, usually a great actor, seemed stilted an oddly comic. Poor Ian McKellan looked and sounded like he was going to croak by the end of the film, Elijah Wood looked too old (and tall) to be believable in this film. What was even more surprising is how they changed how Bilbao finds the ring. We see it in the Lord of the Rings so you would think they would just recreate that scene...nope.

4638053,5,B0059XTU1S,"It took exactly a decade, but Peter Jackson has finally followed up the LOTR franchise with the first installment of The Hobbit.  Clocking in at just under 3 hours, this film bears some semblance to the three LOTR films, but in other ways it is quite different.

First the similarities.  They include a large ensemble cast with many key roles, distinct and unique personalities, and great dialogue from everyone.  There is also the awesome soundtrack, essentially a symphony for the movie with its melodies rooted in romance classicism.  The film also has two great choral pieces, one of which was also featured in the first movie trailer.  Then there is the beautiful make-up, costume design, set design, and incredible detail of the weaponry, animals, and other non-human characters.  And finally we have the awesome cinematography that shows the best of both New Zealand and of Peter Jackson's imagination in bringing Middle Earth to life.  As for the differences, there are few but they are key.  The first big difference is the mood of the film.  There is no romance in this film; distinctly different from the LOTR films which featured one or two key romances per film.  Instead of romance, we have more comedic action.  Whether it be the dwarfs cleaning up Bilbo's dishes, or fighting the trolls, or escaping from Goblin town, the action sequences in this film bear strong semblance to the many Chinese kung fu classics of Jackie Chan.  This is in strong contrast to the action scenes from the LOTR films, which are closer in feel to the grim, gritty fight scenes in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.  Possibly the biggest difference is the visual clarity of The Hobbit.  The 48 frames/minute clearly stood out when I saw this film in Digital 3-D.  On Blu-Ray 2-D, the visual clarity also stands out like no other Blu-Ray I have ever purchased.

The only drawbacks to this package are twofold.  First, this is the theatrical version, with the extended version due out later this year.  Second, there are no previews of the next film, as that was only available online.  Overall, still a great film to own and watch.",1365984000,,2124,4.847222222222222

4638060,4,B0059XTU1S,"So I understand why a lot of people don't like the movie.  It is LONG, and does feel a bit inconsistent.  Unfortunately, those people don't understand the books.

The movie The Hobbit should instead be named ""Everything else in Middle Earth that didn't concern Frodo"", which is totally fine by me, as I've been dying for a decent interpretation of the appendices materials.  Also, covering this much information does take a lot of time, so you should take an intermission once the party is about to depart from Rivendell.

I think what bothers a lot of people in this movie is the disjointedness between laughing dwarves singing merrily and doing dishes at one moment and then messily beheading goblins the next minute.  This is how the books were actually written.  J. R. R. Tolkien, Cambridge linguistics professor, genius, and brilliant author overall, just can NOT write a children's book.  Peter Jackson stays true to the spirit of Tolkien's writing, although that may be somewhat to the movie's detriment.

4638079,5,B0059XTU1S,"I think it's important to judge movies (or books or anything else really) not based on what I want them to be, but what they are attempting to be. And that's particularly relevant here.

Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit.  And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed.

This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.

It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie.

On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.

A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.

One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here.

In fact the humor and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.

And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarves, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive.

But what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarves. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.

Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy.

Speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favorite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.

By this point the Tolkien purists will be ready to strangle me I'm sure. But this was not a movie for the purist.

Tolkien in fact would have hated it. But then I suspect he hated most movies. He disliked technology, he didn't like noise and generally speaking he was a grumpy stick in the mud. And the movie wasn't made for him either.

The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasizing the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.

There are some liberties taken with characterization. Probably less than in The Lord of the Rings but the dwarves in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book. The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.

The party are still heavily dependent on Gandalf to arrive in the nick of time and save the day. But you do get the feeling that if he hadn't they would have gone down fighting rather than totally ineffectually.

What you're getting here isn't a children's movie. It's a modern action movie. Complete with scenes that might have appeared in a video game. Jackson's signature swooping camera is very much in evidence and the scale of the sets is huge.

In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarves Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected.

James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kilie and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.

The Riddles in the Dark sequence is another of my favorite bits in the movie. A tense sequence that blends comedy and tension right down to the ending.

Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!

Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo on screen, not Martin Freeman.

Which brings me on to time. This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.

So where does that leave us?

I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it.  Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am.",1365897600,11,6241,4.41376306620209

4638081,4,B0059XTU1S,I guess I didn't realize that this was a multi-part movie again like Lord of the Rings.  The movie was good overall but definitely not as good as Lord of the Rings.  At least not so far.,1365897600,,186,4.0
4638082,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Movie:
The Hobbit is a good movie for those whom like the fantasy genre. Some people have issues with the scenes with CG creatures, not looking real enough or something. I don't have those same issues.

The 3D:
I use a passive 3D TV and this is definitely one of my, ""See how awesome my system is!"" kind of 3D movies. There is no ghosting present, and the depth is good. Peter Jackson definitely did the 3d right for this movie.

The video quality:
The picture is very clean, and the colors are vibrant in the shire. Definitely takes you back to middle earth from the Lord of the Rings, but it looks better doing so. I did not see anything glaring in the picture quality department.

The Sound: It is great. The score is great, vocals are clean and easy to hear. The stone giant scene is appropriately boomy.

Overall: I do not regret this purchase. In fact I think the film on this 3D Blu-ray actually looks better than when I saw it in the theater. Watching it on my TV is only way I want to see this film now, even if they re-released it in theaters. The only way it could possibly be better is if my TV was a 70"" instead of 55"" which has nothing to do with the Blu-Ray. 5/5 Stars for me.",1365897600,,1195,4.16017316017316

However, to be fair, it was a disappointment compared to LOTRs trilogy.  If you having seen LOTRs yet, then yes, watch The Hobbit, and you'll be satisfied. After watching The Hobbit, watch LOTRs trilogy, and you'll be wow'd.  Here are the reasons I found The Hobbit was a disappointment:

-The beginning was slow, and attempted some humor pieces, which failed.
-The beginning took up a lot of time, yet there you could have skipped 95% of it, and didn't miss out on the movie.
-In LOTRs trilogy, I remembered ALL the character names.  In The Hobbit, the only new names I remembered was Thorin and Azog!  You know it's bad when the characters are not memorable.
-Some of the fighting scenes were stupid unrealistic.  At least in LOTRs, the fighting seemed more believable.",1365897600,,884,4.608974358974359

However, l could not escape from the thought that having seen this - too long a first part of the new trilogy, knowing that we'll have two more....I am not quite sure wheather Peter Jackson's creativity will endure to meet my expectations of innovative story telling.

Having said that this was a nice film to see I could not get away from the light taste of ""chewing over"" the same meal we had during the Lord of the ring trilogy, which was excellent of its kind.

At this point I am a bit reluctant to be definitive about my recommendation, I guess that will have to wait for the next two parts of this trilogy before one gets a clear opinion.

Update on the amazon prime. We had issues with our vizio TVs playing the amazon prime movies. They would cut out. So apparently, it was related to issues with the vizio not upgrading their system to play amazon prime well. When played through the PS3 and the ROKU over wifi the movies work well.

I have a theory: the person in charge of editing scenes and taking crap out that does not contribute to the story must have been on a payment plan that worked on a pay-per-minute arrangement; the longer the film, the more he made.
The basis of my theory, is that you have a 169 (!) minute movie that could have easily been 69 minutes. Don't believe me? Try this: fall asleep at any random moment and notice that you will not have missed anything remotely relevant and that you will pick up the thread exactly where you left off.

I love that this is sold as a combo pack to cover any and all methods I could possibly want to watch the movie.  I really enjoyed the extras that are included here (the access code to the live Peter Jackson preview event for the next film was a cool add-on).

4638148,2,B0059XTU1S,"I've read all of Tolkien's Middle Earth books at least once and greatly enjoyed the Rings movies and audio books. I was looking forward to more of the same. But this isn't it. Much of the dialog, characters and scenes are not from Tolkien's The Hobbit, and they aren't nearly as good as what Tolkien wrote. The scenery, the sets and many of the costumes and actors are OK -- many are right out of the Lord of the Rings -- but they're not from The Hobbit and they don't all fit this story. And some of the most fascinating characters and scenes in Tolkien's The Hobbit are not in this movie at all! If you want a sword-and-sorcery adventure movie and aren't an avid Tolkien fan, you may like it. For me, I'll read the book again and pass on the second and third installments of this movie.",1365724800,2,788,4.295302013422819
4638149,2,B0059XTU1S,"I have read all of the Tolkien books about Middle Earth, most of them many times.  I was concerned when I heard that they were making a trilogy out of the shortest of all the books, and my concerns turned out to be fully justified.  The Hobbit, as written by Tolkien, is a journey of discovery and self-discovery, wondrous at both.  Tolkien was a meticulous, careful writer and everything in the books is there for a reason.  The books lend themselves to cinema, with their brooding landscapes and range of strange creatures, so it's no wonder that Peter Jackson wants to film them all.

Sadly, Jackson gets so caught up in his visuals that the wonders present in the books get sacrificed continuously to the lusty special effects.  Start with the visit of the Dwarves to Bag End.  In the book, the dwarves come in pairs, and each pair comes with a hood of a specific color.  Jackson gives us Dwarves dressed in some cross between Viking travel wear and cloaks designed for winter in Game of Thrones.  No hoods, nothing to make the travelers invisible to the casual eye.  Worse, the brilliantly humorous troll scene, with the trolls tricked into arguing until daybreak about the proper way to cook hobbit turns into an action sequence.  The only scenes that were substantially faithful to the book were the ones between Gollum and Bilbo.  The rest is just a more or less standard fantasy adventure.  I wish Jackson had taken the lessons he learned from the LOTR--that, when in doubt, use the language of Tolkien--and applied them more to the Hobbit.

That said, my young adult son loved it.  For him, the brilliant special effects were enough to keep him enthralled.  The trilogy will make money, and no doubt set a new standard for digital film making.  Too bad that they did not leave in enough Tolkien for those of us who love the books.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hobbit/dp/054792822X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hobbit</a>",1365724800,2,1982,4.9939024390243905

Again I say Amazon is my store of choice once they do groceries I will then order everything from them. Amazon Prime for LIFE!!!! I just wish I could pay for a lifetime membership. I at least order 2-3 things a week from them. It's great but can cause me to spend a little bit more money than I would like.

I love hearing directly from the people who create the film while I watch it. I'm just incredibly disappointed that Peter Jackson didn't do a director's commentary for this film.

4638221,3,B0059XTU1S,"I loved love loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and found the books for both LoTR and the Hobbit to be fulfilling.  Therefore, we were super excited to hear that Peter Jackson would be at the helm of the Hobbit as well, though we were skeptical when we heard he took a children's book and cut it into three films (bolstering the story with materials from other Tolkien works).  We saw the film in the theater opening weekend and it was alright.  Unfortunately, some of the great characters and character interactions and chemistry that were in LoTR were missing with this lot of dwarves and a single hobbit and the story moved a little slow.  Our friend who has read The Hobbit 11 times (!!) was actually offended by some of the extra material, as he thinks The Hobbit is a pretty perfect story.  Peter Jackson also pulled some of what made LoTR great using some of the exact music and lush NZ scenery, but it somehow didn't feel as authentic.

We bought the movie in 3D to try it out on a new TV at home and I actually enjoyed it more the second time watching it, maybe because my expectations aren't as high.  I am looking forward to seeing the next two as well - but it's no Lord of the Rings.",1365552000,,1197,4.293333333333333

Nothing to do for that - the story is about dwarves and one Hobbit, who was thoroughly entertaining.  We also get another chance to meet the elves and white wizard again, who I don't believe appear in the book.  I think it doesn't make any sense to have a trilogy based on this short novel, and I hope the filmmakers don't lose their shirts on these exhorbitant productions.

4638242,5,B0059XTU1S,"I'm surprised they got as far as they did as the story was so involved. Tolkien wrote an amazingly complex piece in both the ""Hobbit"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"". Here, we see MiddleEarth for the first time and while the movie did take some ""poetic license"" from the written story, it remained true to the heart of the work. Here, we find the Dwarves as strong characters, not as mere silly shrunken people in a simple fairy tale and Thorin Oakenshield is a character one could aspire to emulate, even with his stubborn faults. While we have yet to see the Dragon, the backstory of Erebor showed that he will be a force to be reckoned with in the next film. The riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum was classic showing Gollum as the dangerous creature he truly was. While the Goblins were a bit cartoonish in some ways, I tended to view them as a slightly different species similar and allied to Orcs, granting them the lisence Jackson was seeking. I hope the other movies come out soon. I too want to ""stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks to see the last light of the setting sun of Durin's Day shine upon the keyhole"" . For when they get that door open, I want to see what happens next. When this comes out in extended edition,I'll be in line to get a copy to see what I missed.",1365465600,,1291,4.295081967213115

So I had a dilemma...I didn't want to buy the Blu-Ray twice...but I want to see the movie again now.  :-)  Compromise:  buy the video-on-demand version, since that's cheaper than the theatrical Blu-Ray.

So, so far my kids and I have gotten part of the way through, on two separate nights.  The one thing I miss is subtitles, which would help the kids understand the characters with stronger accents (and tickle my geekish fancy by showing dialogue in other languages).  That, I guess, will wait for the Extended Edition.",1365465600,,680,4.801724137931035

An Unexpected Journey covers roughly the first seven chapters of the novel, with some additions, some of which work, some do not. The Pale Orc, The Brown Wizard, while they are colorful additions to the movie don't seem necessary to the story. Tolkien did a wonderful job pacing the book, and all of the changes made to the movie adaptation just seem like a greedy effort to lengthen the stand-alone story to a full trilogy.

I am not a director, just an observer.  The movie is very long, and left me confused.  The ending scene was hokey.

The movie is pretty funny at times, but they contradict this with the ""seriousness"" of the content.

That's why it's going to be 3 movies from the last I heard. For a little book there was a lot of action in it. And it takes up a lot of film and time to tell a story the right way. The only real gripe I have with the movie is that several of the 'dwarves' don't look like dwarve's at all. And I see no reason why they should look like regular men. They are not regular men, they are dwarves and should have been made to look so. Thorin, Fili and Kili in particular needed a lot more makeup to convince me they were portraying dwarves. All the acting was great. Radagast was a trip. Really funny. This is a very good movie and I look forward to the rest of them coming out.",1365379200,,807,3.926829268292683

As the title of this review suggests, I thought the movie was decent. However, it occurs to me that The Lord of the Rings was told in three movies, one for each book. The Hobbit, a much shorter simpler story is also going to be three movies, the first of which is almost four hours.

Jackson et al have taken a story that tells useful lessons about not being able to deny one's part in the world and turned it into complete crap.  The film strays so far from the book that I feel very sorry for young ones that see this movie and never read the real thing.

The liberties taken with this movie, only in the first hour, had me howling.  Two of the most appalling:

Our party of dwarves come across an old derelict house.  Gandalf says that a farmer and his wife used to live here.  Read--Jackson killed off Tom Bombadill and Goldberry!  Why?  What's the point?

Gandalf finds and gives Bilbo the dagger, Sting, which Bilbo tries to reject.  In the book, Bilbo finds Sting on his own and claims it with confidence.

I'm not sure WTF Jackson et al were going for in this misadventure, but I see no reason at all to see the upcoming films or even finish this first one.  I give Jackson a stiff middle finger for messing up an iconic piece of literature.",1365379200,40,1236,4.3744493392070485

It's a wonderful experience when a film stays close to the book that it was taken from. Jackson did a very good job with the Lord of the Rings trilogy but there is so much padding in this film that it's barely recognizable.

In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film this film just went off line. The believably in the characters was not there for me in this first part of the Hobbit. Unlike the LOR movies that felt like a family film this film lost my attention making me go back and read the Hobbit again since my memories of the book where that it was a book for all ages and this film felt like a children's movie.

Our taste in music art and film is of course subjective, but at this point I'm very disappointed with every release of the Hobbit in film done to this point .

I also have to wonder how and why Jackson would take a single book, in fact the shortest book of this series and stretch it into a trilogy. If we are lucky Jackson will do something to rectify this when these three films are released to Blue-Ray and DVD. Something like editing them down to the essence of the book rather than enhancing and already great story.

The trilogy was great but this film is nothing more that a long drawn out revamped version of the same old story. It dragged for the first hour. I wanted so badly to turn it off. I'm disappointed in this film and would recommend to anyone who wants the real story to rent the 1977 animated movie The Hobbit or There and Back Again.

4638361,5,B0059XTU1S,"First of all, this film is amazing.  For anyone who thinks otherwise, well, now you know not to bother with parts 2 & 3 (and save us from reading more ridiculous reviews).  For the majority of the world who can't get enough of Jackson's brilliant epic, rest assured that this 3D Blu Ray release it absolutely gorgeous.  I have never watched a 3D Blu Ray before, and up until recently had only seen the 3D demos in my local Best Buy, with beat up 3D glasses and equipment.  However, a few weeks back I purchased a new 60"" 3D-enabled Samsung Smart TV, and the first Blu Ray I purchased as to test drive the 3D feature was The Hobbit.

I can safely tell you that if you want to experience this 3D Blu Ray in all its brilliant glory, you should have a decent quality 3D television.  The bigger the screen, perhaps the better the quality of the 3D image.  On my 60"", I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the clarity and depth that the 3D provided.  I always viewed 3D as a gimmick that was best used when you wanted things to jump out at the audience, or to provide a cheap jolt now and again.  What I have come to realize, from watching The Hobbit, Avatar, and a few select others is that the 3D opens up the entire image to the point that you feel as if you could jump through the screen, and with regards to the The Hobbit in particular, straight into Middle Earth.  The image was that sharp, and the depth was that great.  I also want to point out that the 3D glasses were much nicer than I expected.  I always thought they would be huge and bulky, but they are in fact very light and non-intrusive.  As I have told anyone who would listen, I would certainly prefer to watch The Hobbit in 3D whenever possible, rather than in 2D.  The only disappointing aspect was the fact that the film is split up onto two discs.  It's a minor inconvenience, but I did want to point it out.  That said, having originally been one of those who despised the idea of 3D in the theater, I now believe that if it is used PROPERLY, and SPARINGLY (meaning not just added in post production to crappy movies simply as a gimmick to get people in the seats), then 3D can add a tremendous amount to the experience of watching a great movie, either in the theater or at home.

Finally, I want to comment on those who feel that Warner Bros. is ""sticking it"" to their customers by ""double dipping.""  First of all, there are actually people who might prefer the theatrical cut to any future extended edition.  Therefore, why would you NOT start by releasing the theatrical version?  Also, believe it or not Warner Bros. is in the business of making money, so to release the extended edition around the holidays makes sense.  It also builds anticipation for part 2.  I'm sure it can be frustrating for some, but it's a joke that people give 1-star ratings due to the fact that WB doesn't just throw everything out there for us on day one.  I have always been a huge fan of the way that WB tries to deliver quality content, as I am sure it's hard to satisfy everyone.  So in conclusion, I thought that the Hobbit was amazing in 3D while it was in theaters, and I can tell you that it is equally amazing on a good 3D TV.  If you have a nice setup, and are a fan of the film, go ahead and grab it (then grab the extended edition later in the year, since I am of the opinion that both versions are a must-have).  Thanks for reading, and enjoy the rest of this incredible ride!",1365206400,6,3435,4.246153846153846
4638362,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let's face it. Preludes typically suck. I assumed that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was going to be just another failed attempt at a prelude. Thankfully, I was wrong!

Sometimes when glancing at negative reviews, I feel that many have not even watched the movie which they are reviewing. In the case of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the naysayer ""reviews"" tend to follow the same theme as what I felt the first time I saw the preview. However, I will not judge a movie without first seeing it. In most cases, my initial instincts are right. That is not the case with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. That fact alone makes me wonder how many of the ""1 Star"" reviewers have actually watched it and how many of them are just writing reviews based on their ""initial feelings"".

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey serves as a prelude to the breathtaking LOTR trilogy. Since the events of this story are set before those of LOTR, the theme is of a more peaceful Middle-Earth. That doesn't mean that darkness isn't spread throughout the land. It's just well hidden from the normal flow. Since you know what's coming, it makes you want to jump into the screen and slap some of them!

* Sir Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman return to play the roles of Gandalf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins. Both give remarkable performances.
* The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey shows a deeper look into the Dwarfs, which I find adds to the LOTR trilogy. In fact, I felt compelled to revisit those movies after seeing The Hobbit.
* The graphics soared above all of my expectations.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a very small book. The writers did an outstanding job of supplementing the short story with other looks into Tolkien's other worlds.

Like so many others, the amount of criticism from negative reviewers forced me to believe that this would be just another failed Hollywood attempt at a prelude. ""I've never been so wrong in all my life."" I would recommend that all fans of the original trilogy watch The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.",1365206400,,2036,4.707865168539326

4638370,3,B0059XTU1S,"Ok... but inexcusably tied into the LOTR, overlong, riddled with unneeded dread and battles, and made into a LOTR retread instead of standing on its own as a fresh tale of adventure.

My primary objection was that Jackson weighted down the story with the gloom of 'the shadow' - a growing demon threat - and inserted scenes of Frodo, Saruman, Galadriel, a villian Pale Goblin complete with extended back story, Radagast's bunny mobile and everything else that wasn't in the book.  He could have presented a leaner brighter film which was truer to the story and therefore more clever and adventurous.  How many boring unwritten orc battles do we really need?

I thought Martin Freeman was quite good as Bilbo, and the various drawfs are distinct and well played.  The drawf song Misty Mountains was terrific, but so short.  They could have included additional verses playing over following scenes (as was done to great effect in the trailer). Ian MaKellen is always terrific, but I felt that he wasn't allowed to live the role here, but was mostly made to deliver a few deep thoughts at essential moments.  He was forced to be angry, sad, or fighting way too much.

The riddle game with Gollum - which could have been this film's showcase - was ok but abbreviated, with half the riddles cut out and none of the suspense, and ended with Bilbo considering at long length whether or not to kill Gollum.  This unnecessary ending with the extra long look at Gollum's big sad eyes was pure audience insult.  Bilbo is the kind of creature that doesn't kill unless he absolutely has to, and it was bad enough that Jackson had Gandalf educating Bilbo on sparing lives, but far worse when the decision to dispatch Gollum was made into such a prolonged vital thing, when it was incidental in the original and far more effective as such.  Instead of being about personality and serendipity as Bilbo leap over Gollum and dashed away, we have ""the pity of Bilbo"" shoved down our throats.  A little more respect for the audience would have been soooooo nice.

This film isn't an adventure story where shrewdness, luck, wizardry and happenstance win the day, it's an orc filled growl fest with hordes of vile creatures being ridiculously slain again and again by a tiny group of super fighters.  Bilbo and drawfs were never intended to be ultra commandos, but in the film Bilbo wields his sword to defend Thorin against a huge orc and warg, leading a charge against the orcs in which the drawfs beat them back.  Seriously?  Bilbo as bold sword swinging, battle ground charging, super killer?  The original story had wolves instead, and that would have been something different (yeah!), and equally or perhaps more effective, but no.... we had to get orcs.

4638371,5,B0059XTU1S,I am happy that Jackson is making a Hobbit movie in the same exceptional manner of the Rings trilogy.

4638372,5,B0059XTU1S,"This is not intended to be a specific review of the movie, or offer in-depth commentary on the content of the movie or the decisions made by Peter Jackson on what to include in the movie, although I will touch on that briefly.  Suffice it to say, any movie based off a book is much better enjoyed and appreciated to the fullest if the book is read first.  Some of the negative reviews I've heard about the movie are comments related to content in the movie not found in the book, and while that may be slightly true, it does not detract from the enjoyment of the movie.

Blu Ray DVDs have come a long way from their start and I am happy to see that these DVDs have fast start to watch time (after short data load) and I can now pause the movie and can resume at the same exact point where I stopped previously.  This may have more to do with your DVD hardware capabilities (I use a PS3) but just the same a very nice feature.  The quality of the DVDs are excellent and the menus easy to navigate.  I have not yet explored the bonus disks and the 3D disks would not display on my TV.  I think its probably due to a software update needed for my TV which I have not taken the time to upgrade.  Not being a huge 3D fan anyway, it hasn't been a priority.  The sound quality is DTS and is very good.  And yes, I wish the DVD contained the extended version of the movie as I'm sure I will purchase that too when it comes out later.

As a huge fan of the Tolkien books and the Jackson Lord of the Rings movies, I found the content of the story line to be accurate and true to the book with an occasional extravagance thrown in by Jackson.  It will be important to remember that the story still has two parts to go and the final judgment of the presentation should be reserved until the entire story is presented.  This is an incredible visual treat that brings the multi layer and rich content of Tolkien's book to life in a way that makes it truly believable and exciting.",1365206400,,1966,4.1421052631578945

Jacksons Axl Rose-like obsessions led to over-saturated frames and poor storyline alterations. Gandalf suddenly suspects something sinister is going on - so are you telling me at the beginning of LoTR he decides to celebrate with fireworks while suspecting the end of all things was coming? Seriously?

Stupid alterations to soften the stark contrast between The Hobbit and LoTR leads to a feeling of money-grabbing and/or flat-out poor craftmanship.

As for the oversaturation, this is no small issue. Every time there is a blade of green grass on screen, grab those glasses because you'll need them. The entire movie is rendered into a Tim Burton-esque Pee-Wee's Playhouse of neon color and poor interpretations of nature.

4638397,5,B0059XTU1S,"Saw this movie in theaters -- twice.  The first time, I went on opening night with a group from my literature class.  We had just finished reading ""The Hobbit"" and everyone had liked the book--we couldn't wait to see it visually.  It blew us away.  Definitely not the same as Lord of the Rings, but in the same world.  The humor was fantastic, the acting superb, the storytelling (as always) excellent.  I loved seeing Richard Armitage's, Martin Freeman's, and Andy Serkis' (Gollum) work -- they all did a great job, especially Freeman.  The actor really nailed Bilbo's character and manner.  He really made me see the similarities between his character and the older version played by Ian Holme.  Armitage played a very heroic Thorin--I hadn't actually liked Thorin's character until I saw it off-page and on screen.  The writers and actors were able to pull the best bits of each character and bring it to light.
The graphics (for me) were a little less than par, mostly because they screamed CG to me (as opposed to the LOTR's very real, very cool fellbeasts and wargs.  Why did the change the warg design?  They were already so terrifying in the Two Towers.)  But Gollum was great and the lighting in this movie was so beautiful.
This movie is definitely not for everyone--if you aren't really a fantasy lover or a Tolkein fan, I understand comepletely.  But if you loved the book, there is no reason not to love the movie.  It was so hiliarious and touching to hear Tolkein's words--spoken by Bilbo or Gandalf--and the dialogue in Riddles in the Dark.  Every person owned their character and their moments.
My favorite parts of the movie were the Contract Scene (I loved how the seemingly unrealistic part of the book was used in a humorous way), the Riddles in the Dark Scene (who can't like that?) and Thorin's charge down the burning tree (awesome!).  The dwarves' theme, the Misty Mountains, was terrific, as was the credit song ""Song of the Lonely Mountain"" which echoed the dwarves' pride, hope, and vengeance.
I can hardly wait for Hobbit 2.",1365120000,2,2053,4.738028169014084
4638398,2,B0059XTU1S,Why add all sorts of dumb extra details so you can make a movie longer? Is it a funny kids movie with singing dwarves? Is it an over-violent fantasy movie? YES! Peter Jackson was better when he couldn't overreach as much.,1365120000,2,221,4.414634146341464
4638399,5,B0059XTU1S,Great movie. I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the LotR movies. The colors are beautiful and Martin Freeman is amazing as Bilbo Baggins. I've probably watched it 8 times already.,1365120000,,181,4.870967741935484
4638400,4,B0059XTU1S,"Overall, it was better than the first movie of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. And a I believe a broader audience will enjoy this more than LOTR.
Details:
This is a ""must see"" for LOTR and Tollkien fans, as for the rest of you, you will enjoy it to. There are significant reminders and similarities to the ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", but not enough to turn me away. There is a lighthearted whimsey and underlying/subtle humor to this movie that only Martin Freeman (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, 2005) can deliver. Freeman, in my option, was the perfect choice for the young Bilbo Baggins. This movie definitely lacks the ""whininess"" that Elija Wood brought to the LOTR series. The additional humor definitely opens this movie up to a broader audience than the LOTR series did but, so far, it still sticks to the epic storyline that Tollkien is famous for and won't leave his fans, like me, disappointed.
I must admit that I did not see this movie in the theater and that I was not highly anticipating it as I was with LOTR. Now I am kicking myself for that because, in my opinion, ""The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey"" is off to a better start to The Hobbit series than The Fellowship was. Don't get me wrong.... The LOTR movies were fabulous, but I am definitely liking this one better. Mostly because I can only take Elija Wood for so long (9 hours pushes my threshold). But since Martin, as Bilbo Baggins, is a bit more adaptable and versatile an actor (and not whiney and pathetic like Elija Wood was as Frodo) makes it an easier more enjoyable movie to watch.
I would have given it 5 Stars if Jackson had not included Wood in the beginning. That is where the storyline strays and it was totally unnecessary. But I suppose Jackson did not have a choice in the matter and at least he kept Woods' cameo to a minimum.
Again, as he did with the LOTR trilogy, Peter Jackson delivers a visually stunning movie. But, In my opinion, the scenery in LOTR took the lead roll whereas, in this movie, the story line is more pronounced and you aren't distracted by the visuals.",1365120000,,2085,4.489473684210527
4638401,2,B0059XTU1S,"Preface by saying I'm a huge fan of Jackson's LOTR. I thought he really captured the spirit of Tolkien's work, even with the liberties he took with the story. I was concerned he (and Fran & Philippa) would cleave too closely to the more adolescent tone of ""The Hobbit"", (example: ""and in this way the battle was won and the game of golf invented at the same moment"") rather than take the strength of the story and imbue it with the same spirit as LOTR. But my fears were realized.

The first 40 minutes was pretty excruciating--slow and juvenile--and then the movie settled in to oscillating between mildly diverting and mildly annoying. **A lot** of been-there-done-that feel on many action sequences, and like every Jackson movie since 2000, soooooo much fat to be trimmed. Run time could easily have been 40 min shorter.

The musical overlays were often cloyingly maudlin and redundant.

Freeman is actually quite a good Bilbo, even tho' at times he's plunked into some hideously written/directed scenes.

Plus, my heavens!! What is up with Thorin, the Brad Pitt of Dwarf-dom? Bizarre, distracting, pandering, uneven character design.

Gandalf at times seems oddly Alzheimers-ish, and don't get me started on Radagast. I always conceived the Wizards as being this supra-human force in Middle Earth, and here they're portrayed as one step from the rest home. Because it's so *funny*, you see.

Instead, we are left with vignettes down dead alleyways that do not truly progress the story.  The beginning could have been dramatically shortened with Bilbo starting his book (Frodo in passing was okay), but there are so many back stories going it was hard to keep track of the real story.  Great visual presentations, althought he Goblin king was poorly done and reminded one of a cartoon character or theft of Jabba The Hut.  And now, two more movies are coming down the pike.  Yawn.

I have no issues with Jackson's 3-D or HD filming but I will admit that sometimes during very 3-D heavy scenes, it's difficult to track the characters due to the surrounding action.

In this movie the dwarves and Frodo get thrown around, bashed, buried under rocks, fall off cliffs, almost get eaten by trolls....and come up fighting every time!  You just can't kill them!  The scenery is delightful, both the good and the bad, and the dialogue is frequently witty, while sticking very close to some of the dialogue in the book.  I enjoyed the fact that the dwarves are different sizes and shapes, not just clones of one another, and with very different personalities from one another, again not just clones.

4638470,3,B0059XTU1S,"Being an owner of almost two dozen Blu Ray 3D movie releases purchased in past year  I was always enjoying  each and every one of them on my 106"" projector screen and Optoma HD83 gear and latest Optoma BG-ZF2100GLS glasses. The announcement of Hobbit - a ""masterpiece"" as called by many reviewers made me believe this is going to be even more breathtaking movie experience I have ever seen so far. Long preorder wait rewarded with disk set arrival was supposed to exceed my expectations - but it didn't.

Right from the start, the first seconds of the movie made me think there is something wrong with my gear as 3D picture seemed to be crisp and clear as usual but unusually stereoscopic where instantly I noticed unnatural depth of field which made my eyes tired just after few minutes of watching. This is the same effect when short sided person gets the glasses with bad eye pupillary distance. To eliminate or confirm gear issue I replaced the disk with three other 3D movies I watched in the past: I Robot, Avatar and Prometheus. All three confirmed there is nothing wrong with the gear showing perfect picture as usual without any eye related discomfort.

I put back the Hobbit disk and the problem came back. I had to actually change the viewing distance and get further away from the screen to the back wall of my projection room to make viewing acceptable. This is very unusual move because so far the distance from the screen never mattered and watching 3D movies from any distance or any angle was always enjoyable without any flaws or discomfort.

I followed the observation path of unnatural depth of field, and I have noticed that the actual amount of L-R picture shift is dramatically different comparing to other three movies I mentioned above.  The easiest way to check it is to turn on subtitles and check the relative shift between L and R frame by looking at the subtitle letters with the 3D glasses not used. I noticed that on Hobbit the shift is far greater comparing to other movies and this made confirmed my observation about unusually large depth of field on entire picture which could cause my eyes discomfort.

Despite of the above, with apprehension and viewing discomfort I managed to watch entire 3D movie to the end. But I was disappointed that the actual BD transfer is bad and causes my eyes tired for the first time I watch 3D movie. Among many others I own, this is the first one and probably the last one in the Hobbit series - at least in 3D version.

I  took a time and played 2D version disk and the picture was perfect, natural although two-dimensional. This is going to be version I will probably enjoy with upcoming episodes of Tolkien Hobbit released on disk.

I am just not sure how come director allowed releasing movie based on flawed transfer or authoring. The only explanation to this would be this was intentional. Not good for me, probably for some viewers either.",1364947200,,2916,4.633720930232558

4638480,5,B0059XTU1S,"First and foremost, let me say that this movie is an EXCEPTIONAL film in all respects.  It tells an engaging story, and is visually stunning from beginning to end.

This movie is based LOOSELY on JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" which was the original book upon which the Lord of the Rings trilogy was based.  The book is a light-hearted, child-friendly tale about a meek halfling who is unwittingly thrust into great events through the intervention of Gandalf the Gray.

The movie starts with quite a bit more back-story, and takes a lot of liberties with the history of Middle Earth.  It's also MUCH darker, with significant realistic violence and the introduction of serious story lines (like the rise of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur) which are only hinted at in the book, or like the introduction of Azog, which was made up whole cloth, I can only guess in an effort to stretch a shortish book into three feature length films.  As such, this is not a film for small children.

But that, and the fact that the Dwarves are too short and their beards are an insult to all of Durin's Folk aside, this is simply an exceptional movie, and a must have for your collection.",1364947200,,1164,4.594202898550725

That said, if you like weird little people who sing and dance while they do the dishes and fight monsters without ever being in any real danger at all then this is for you. There are so many unrealistic scenes where our merry band of warriors should have died, yet somehow come out unscathed and smiling, that you lose interest almost immediately. If none of the main characters can ever get hurt, then why should I care when they roll into battle? Also if I was hanging out with the Wizard I'd be pretty upset that despite being all powerful he never uses his magic, or if he does he does so half way. Many others have commented on the eagles and why they didn't just fly them the whole way so I'll leave that alone, but do your self a favor and avoid this...unless you suffer from insomnia, then there is a good chance this film will cure your ills.",1364947200,5,918,4.405882352941177

4638495,2,B0059XTU1S,"I have been a huge fan of these books for a very long time.  Tolkien took classic northern myth and fairy tails and re-spun them into a literary fantasy masterpiece.  Unfortunately many years after they were written a man named Peter Jackson came along and decided that the source material was not good enough and that he could somehow change it all for the better.  There are a few qualities about this film I liked such as the actors who portray Thorin, Gandalf and Bilbo.  I also enjoyed the oh so important songs actually portrayed in the film.  These things however are not enough to save this franchise in my eyes however.  The orcs are magically able to fight in open daylight in several scenes (this would completely negate the need for Uruk-hai in the later stories if this were true).  Bilbo tackles a full grown orc off his feet and gains the upper ground in a wrestling match before stabbing him to death.  These small details I can ignore but the blatant use of cartoon physics (domino trees as one example), silly cartoon voices (the trolls for one) and terrible dialogue (""that'll about do it"" as the goblin king dies) make the whole movie feel like a Saturday morning cartoon.  I realize that The Hobbit is a slightly more childish and light hearted tale than the rest of the ring saga but it was never downright ridiculous.  And while I am talking about silly, what is up with the strange dwarven hairstyles.  They look more like something out of a Disney cartoon than a Tolkien movie.  And who decided that dwarves are Scottish?  It would also be nice to hear the worgs and eagles speak as they did in the book.  Taking council with the king of eagles would have been a really beautiful thing to see brought to life.  Lastly Radaghast the brown (don't know if I spelled that right) was one living Disney/wb cartoon all rolled into one.  And why bird crap on his head?

Beyond all that the movie is fairly polished other than a bit overuse of CG.  Many breathtaking scenes as we have come to expect from Peter.  There is a great deal of powerful acting but some of the best scenes are marred with silly visuals.  Soundtrack is fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did not just recycle the previous music for this film.  There is a lot to be praised but at the end of the day I would rather have a well written story as close to the source material as possible than a beautiful film hollow and empty of the magic the books captured.",1364860800,41,2470,4.46875
4638496,2,B0059XTU1S,"First do misunderstand me I really enjoy watching the movie. I think they have now a good understanding of Tolkien corpus. They have translated in pictures in a way not so different of my understanding of the stories even if there have been too much war actions and green screen visual effects in the movies for me.

But the marketing operation to sell the movies makes me sad. Like another review I do not want to buy any blue-ray versions because I do not wait for a coming extended version but rather the final marketing box offer of the trilogy on 2015! I bought the DVD two-disc special edition. After going through all the advertisements I could watch th movie, at last. When I wanted to see a making of on the second DVD I found nothing alike my expectations but already published stuff. I wondered even why the aim of this edtion, a one disc edition would have been enough with the internet link for the already published extra features.

My conclusion:
It is Warner Bros which killed Harry Potter not Vodomort by the marketing sale operations of the movies, DVD, etc. It is Warner Bros again which killed Neo in Matrix not agent Smith by the marketing sale operations of the movies, DVD, etc.

It would honest for them to release the movie trilogy every six months, I and we will be very happy not only be seen as potential marketing targets but as happy readers of Tolkien books or as happy movie goers too.",1364860800,,1417,4.505836575875486

I never stopped hoping though that they were just making them in the order they were written instead of chronologically.  I found this to be very well done as was The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

4638510,5,B0059XTU1S,"If you loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you will at the very least really like the Hobbit.  The film's tone and production style seamlessly meshes with that of  the LOTR trilogy, and the returning cast make their characters feel every bit as real and alive as they did before.  The newcomers jump right into the mix without hesitation and succeed at every turn.  Martin Freeman is quaint and enjoyable as Bilbo, although I have to say he made the film seem almost British in a contemporary way at the very beginning of the film, just because of what I'm used to seeing him in.  Richard Armitage as Thorin exudes kingly strength and dignity in a way I have seldom seen from an actor.  I had not seen him in a film before, and I came away very impressed with him. There are so many other dwarves, all with copious facial hair, its hard to choose standouts, but they all seem to have a moment to shine.

The special effects are predictably fantastic and amazing.  I've heard much grumbling about the CGI in The Hobbit and I do not understand why.  It's a fantasy movie, made in 2012.  Are you surprised there is CGI in abundance?  People act like they would have preferred the production team to use a horde of Jim Henson puppets or claymation models so the enemies would seem more ""substantial"".  I don't think so.  CGI is better than ever. Fantasy and Sci-Fi movies benefit far more from it than not, and the people who deny this most vehemently seem to do so out of an egotistical desire to be seen as insightful and wise, while simultaneously falling into the ideological trap of  ""traditional is always superior.""  Ok, enough polemical rambling.

It's been a long time since I read the Hobbit (back in my Middle School days), so I can't really speak to the faithfulness of the adaption; but as an LOTR fan, I loved the Hobbit and was excited to be back in Middle-Earth once again.  Even after the long hiatus on production, and even after the general confusion of the project's long history, somehow The Hobbit came out as good as a film could be under so much creative stress and under all the pressure that hype can bring to bear on such projects.

Also it bothers me that I have to wait till Christmas for the Bluray version that will actually include the extras that I enjoy so much. Furthermore, I feel the digital format of the movie is overpriced. If movies were around the 7.99-9.99 price point, I'd probably buy 4-5x's more digital movies, however, once it breaks the $10 barrier my willingness to buy is reduced significantly.

Purchasing the HD version does provide you with the half-dozen or so webcasts. Unfortunately, you have to go through the credits to get to them. It is almost be easier to watch them online. There's no quick way to jump to them. I'm not sure if this a limitation to my Samsung Bluray player or the technology of streaming.

4638543,5,B0059XTU1S,"As my headline states, it's best to ignore the negative reviews.  For anyone expecting a fast-moving movie based on a J.R.R. Tolkien novel, you're expecting the wrong thing, especially since this is the first installment of what will become a trilogy.  One critic complained that too much of the first portion of the movie was spent at Bilbo's house.  My counter to that is that this installment is laying the groundwork for subsequent films, and that the first 45 minutes or so are designed to establish motive, characters, and the basic framework of the plot.

In Peter Jackson fashion, this movie is full of sweeping panoramic scenes of the incredible New Zealand lanscapes.  On Blu-Ray, the crispness, clarity, and sharpness of the picture almost makes you feel as if you are there.  The acting is top-notch, Martin Freeman is delightful as Bilbo, Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf and is excellent, as usual.  Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield, is terrific in his portrayal of the Dwarven king.  Special effects (especially the motion-capture effects of Gollum and Azog the orc) are wonderful, leaps and bounds above The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Howard Shore's musical score carries over many of the motifs set forth in The Lord of the Rings, but additional compositions of original motifs make the score every bit as rich and sweeping as his previous work.

4638550,4,B0059XTU1S,"Some thoughts on seeing the hobbit movie
My reviews are basically written for John and Greg , two old friends who are sensitive and artistic and sometimes like similar things to the things that I find interesting.
The movie the Hobbit is nothing at all like the book the Hobbit.
I always liked the book, the Hobbit, because when reading the book the reader can tell that Tolkien is realizing the story, creating the story in his mind, relating the story to his larger conceptual continuity as he is writing the story.
The reader can also sense that the story begins more or less as a children's book with some interesting wordplay and cute characters, and only as it progresses through the middle and towards the ending does it become heavier and more adult.
The movie the hobbit, overall, is a breath-taking rush with a few reflective moments and a few gems from the book.
At first, I was disappointed as the hobbit movie started because it did not follow the book.  As the movie progressed I began to realize what was going on and I became absorbed into the story and started to enjoy it.
The movie begins with Bilbo BAGGINS writing the story of the hobbit to give to Frodo. As Bilbo thinks about writing the story he briefly re- counts the history of the dwarves and the dragon taking away their treasure and their homeland then the story goes back 60 years earlier and begins the story again like the book the hobbit begins.
All of this is a bit confusing and I was very glad when they finally got around to Gandalf coming to Bilbo's door, introducing himself and having the famous ""good morning "" conversation with Bilbo. The movie does not capture the cute funny situation that Tolkien wrote in the book. The dwarves do not look like the dwarves as I always imagined them to look they're not nearly as cute and then not nearly as funny and the whole situation of how the dwarves arrive at the door and hang up their cloaks and introduce themselves to a flummoxed BILBO in my opinion was not captured at all in the movie.
Honestly, I think Peter Jackson could have captured the feeling of the beginning of the book much better.  I felt that at least as much energy was expanded but not the right tone was set.
Even little things like how BILBO  wakes up the next morning and Gandalf reminds him that he's late and he runs off without his handkerchief did not have the same cute fun flavor of the book.  Moving along to the encounter with the three mountain trolls, again, although the trolls were amazing looking, a triumph of CGI, they were not funny like the original book was.  Lots of little interesting memorable parts of the story were rewritten for no apparent reason not to make it better but perhaps to make it flow visually more successfully who knows.
And as usual with any blockbusters CGI movie today each and every single scene was overdone. Mountains fighting and dropping rocks on the little group was way over the top the floor of the cave opening up and the dwarves and Gandalf falling apparently miles down into the mountain into a timber constructed trap was way over the top somehow when you read the book you don't get the full impression of thousands and thousands and thousands of squirming wriggling hideous orcs as you see in the movie. The way that the orc king is finally killed is quite graphic and violent in fact all of the endless endless fighting as Gandalf and a group of dwarves try to escape is hideously violent much more so than my impression from the book.
Parts of the story, the hobbit, are rewritten for the movie.  This is an interesting development.  Tolkien wrote the story the Hobbit before he fleshed out the story of the LordOfTheRings and before he fleshed out the Silmarilion which was written after the LOTR ( and tells the story of the dark lord before the story of the hobbit ) . What Peter Jackson has done is combined elements of the LOTR story with elements of the eventual prequel into this  movie story The Hobbit.  This is interesting but not necessarily enjoyable or desirable.
For instance, Radagast The Brown is quite a major character in the hobbit movie I don't think he is even in the hobbit book but he is an interesting character and probably adds a lot to the enjoyment of the movie.
I noticed in the credits that Benedict Cumberbatch plays the part of the NECROMANCER.  This is a little strange because in the movie than NECROMANCER is seen only as a fuzzy black shadow for a few seconds so there must be more of him to come in parts two and three.
So, what we have basically is a retelling of the story of the hobbit with out the cuteness and with a lot of flashbacks and flash forwards and embellishments and retelling's and changes and with a lot of breakneck fast movement chase scenes and way over the top CGI.
There are some beautiful  poignant poetic unforgettable insightful  SCENES in the movie the hobbit.
When Gandalf speaks to Elrond and Galadriel and Saruman at the table outside of RivenDell it is great.
When Bilbo confronts gollum on the shore of the lake under the mountain in the cave and they have their riddle game it is great, except that I could not understand everything that Gollum was saying which in effect destroys all enjoyment of the scene because the whole point of the scene that is to understand the  riddles.  But Gollum's acting is superb.
The finding of the RING is different from the book, But, it flows nicely and  makes visual sense and is OK.  This special effect the special affect of how Bilbo sees things when he is wearing the RING and therefore invisible works perfectly visually on the screen and is totally successful.
All in all, I would have been happier if the movie was cuter, more faithful to the book, and if the dwarves looked more like all of the dwarf illustrations we have seen for the last 50 years.
I think it is nice that  SMAUG is not only hinted at but almost shown especially at the end of the movie where he is lying in his treasure trove under the mountain, buried in gold coins but waking up as if he has been disturbed because he senses that Thorin Oakenshield and the other dwarves are on their way.
Some of the main themes of the movie are not clearly expressed because the people speaking them have either intense speech impediments because of makeup or they have accents or they have peculiar voices so what they're saying is not clear enough and therefore the themes are not expressed clearly.  I was a little disturbed by this.
Again, all in all, this movie the hobbit is probably as good as we can expect.  As a fan and reader of the books I cannot really judge how this movie would impact someone who did not know the story from reading it or who had only seen the lord of the rings movies and now was interested in what happened before.
This movie is visually overpowering, stunning, an amazing accomplishment, and very satisfying.
So, upon awakening this morning, having slept after watching the hobbit movie, I realize that the parts of the movie that have been playing over and over in my head are a combination of parts from the book that weren't in the movie that I was reminded of by seeing the movie and some of the visuals in the movie that were in the book but not amazing in the book and some of the visuals that are in the movie which were not in the book at all.  For instance,
For instance, I keep visualizing the multicolored cloaks hanging on the hooks in the hobbit hallway which is in the book but not in the movie.
I keep visualizing Radagast The Brown who iswas not in the book at all.
I keep seeing the amazing long involved convoluted escape of Gandalf and the dwarves from the underground caverns of the mountain orcs which, is in the book, but I never quite fleshed it out with visuals.
I keep visualizing the scene where Bilbo has to leap over Gollum's head to escape through the gate on the back end of the mountain from the lair of the mountain orcs.  This scene is quite different in the movie, the movie combines the escape of Gandalf and dwarves with Bilbo's leaping through the doorway. In the book, these are separate occurrences and they meet up on the mountainside in the forest after.  In the movie, they are combined in a successful interesting way very satisfying.  I keep seeing the leader of the orcs who has white skin and it's terribly scarred one armed and large vicious,riding on a warg, a giant werewolf, ( to my knowledge. )  To my knowledge, he is not necessarily in the book in any way shape or form, but he is a major player in the hobbit movie part one.  Maybe he is necessary to focus our fear and apprehension in the movie.
One of the other complicated, convoluted, and recreated up from multiple scenes, seems in the hobbit movie use again the discussion between Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Saruman; which, in my memory, does not actually take place in the hobbit book but does help to establish the fact that the dark lord has returned to the forest and is gathering power and is called the NECROMANCER and the character of Saruman,even though he is considered to be the most powerful and knowledgeable white wizard and the leader of the group of which Gandalf is one.  SARUMAN comes across as being glib and thirsty for power and not completely honest so all in all I think that's a successful scene and necessary to tie together the three giant long involved Lord Of The Rings movies with this prequel.",1364688000,,9409,4.507042253521127

The Hobbit is not actually a part of the Lord of the Rings; the storyline takes place earlier and is not intimately connected with LOTR, although the events in the Hobbit set up LOTR. it's nice to read it beforehand but not absolutely necessary.

I thought is was slow and not exciting at all. To its credit it did have some funny one liners. I read the reviews, thought that as a good indication of how the movie rated. No offense to the the people who gave this movie a great rating but you all were way off base. I was generous by giving it 3 stars.

4638560,1,B0059XTU1S,"I'm not sure why Jackson has taken it upon himself to add in so many new elements to the original hobbit story when it has already stood the tests of time. The hobbit was not meant to be a dark epic quest like the LOTR trilogy, but instead a lighter main storyline with many side stories and characters. The whole time I was watching I felt like the story was being rushed from one scene to the next with no regard to the original chronological order laid out by Tolkien.",1364688000,90,471,4.2444444444444445
4638561,3,B0059XTU1S,"This film shows clearly what happens when the commercial needs of 3D, coupled with a director's too enthusiastic fascination with playing with new technology, imposes itself over normal 2D. This film series seems to be following in the same exact steps of the mediocre Star Wars prequel trilogy, where special effects also overwhelmed the character part of the story and took over.

In order for 3D to be viable and worth doing there must constant action of a specific eye popping variety that looks good in 3D. This is the reason that 3D does not lend itself easily to character driven films which is why you see so few dramatic films in this format. For those who only care about action, and pay little attention to the characters and their dialogue, this is your film.

The strength of Peter Jackson's original Lord of the Rings film trilogy was the often dramatic character interaction and how that evolved over time. That is almost totally lacking here in this film. Both my wife and I found the constant ""rollercoaster"" ride imposed on the storyline tiring and much to the detriment of the overall film.

In addition it was very clear to both of us that the director had vastly padded the film out with unnecessary side stories in order to justify having three films when, if he had stuck to the book, two films would have been more than sufficient. Those who have read and loved the original Hobbit book will find themselves constantly scratching their head and asking ""where did that segment come from?"" with this film.

Technically from a special effects only perspective the film is excellent, as you would expect these days. It is in the script and character dialogue that this film really comes up short. BTW in viewing this film on my HD flat screen I did not see any problems with 48 FPS versus 24 FPS issue much mentioned in the press.

I don't know if Peter Jackson reads these reviews but if he does he is what I would tell him: Peter you can do better than this! Great films are story and character driven first. Everything else should only enhance that and is a distant second.

One note for those who have kids. There are a number of decapitations and various ""slicing and dicing"" actions in the many battle sequences. If the enemy had been human instead of goblin or orc, the rating probably would have been an ""R"" instead of the PG13 given to this film.

I can only hope the other two films in the series will be better. Because of all of this I award this film 3 stars, although if it had been allowed I would have given it 3-1/2.",1364688000,,2553,4.53695652173913

Also, the faults of lord of the rings have been dragged into the hobbit.  While gollum is extremely cleverly depicted, his voice and lines are simply awful.

This is an outrageously expensive and noisy special effects orgy from Mr Jackson, having very little character or story development but tons of irrelevant filler.

It hasn't even the slightest resemblance to the beloved book by J RR Tolkien, (unlike  'The Fellowship of the Ring'). I think it will lower your child's I.Q. considerably, but enhance hyperactivity. Jackson suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder and has a phobia of silence and empty space, even when it would serve to enhance the narrative, (narrative? duh, what's that?). He seems to believe his viewers are idiots and he should leave nothing to their limited imagination, (he may be right). The overpowering, hamfisted musical score accompanies this hash with many familiar soporifics from the Lord of the Rings, (never shuts up, constantly reminding the viewer who's in charge of this experience).

Did the gratuitous addition of a wizard covered in moist bird crap really improve the original story?  Nope.  Did adding unneeded new plotlines improve the original story?  Nope.

Some of the LOR characters do make an appearance in the movie, but you now have to get use to new ones.  I sort of missed not seeing Aragorn and the others, but they weren't relevant at the time of this story. There are some slow areas in the movie, where not a lot of action takes place, but it still was a good evening's entertainment.  But be warned. This is only one of two or three videos before the Hobbitt has been told.  So that may be the one let down of this video.  LOR was understandably made in three videos, because there are three books. But the Hobbitt is only one and maybe they could have extended the length of the film and maybe left out some less important stuff in order to tell the whole story in one video.

So lets go on to the product.  There are two important differences between what I saw at the Grauman's Chinese Theater and at home.  My TV is much smaller and my living room isn't as fancy.  The 3D blu ray faithfully reproduced the color balance and saturation I saw at the theater.  I saw no artifacts or scenes that lacked depth.

The Hobbit is inferior in every way to that trilogy.  This one suffers from terrible pacing issues because the story is being stretched out way too much (like butter scraped over too much bread is a perfect analogy for it).  Jackson can't decide on a tone - it's light-hearted and silly (like the book) in places, but then he tries to make it dark and very serious in other places which is a big mistake, IMO.  He should have just stuck with the overall tone of the book and made a PG movie for kids.  That's what this material is - a light, silly story for kids.  Jackson and the studio executives really ruined this property by trying to make it appeal to everyone and stretching the story over a three movie arc, which may be the most blatant attempt to milk a story for every cent possible in the history of cinema.

The CGI is embarrassingly bad in many places.  It takes you completely out of the film.  If LotR was a labor of love, this was pass the baton to the vfx houses and hope they make it look decent.  They didn't.

Yes, Radagast was not in the book. I really enjoyed the addition, though!

Yes, the White Council wasn't in the book, but it did help tie back to Lord of the Rings.

Yes, it was still an awesome movie!!

The scenery is gorgeous, the characters are entertaining, there is plenty of action, drama, and humor.

I highly recommend this film!!",1364601600,,610,4.345132743362832

When I first read that Peter Jackson and his colleagues had decided to turn the story into a trilogy I wondered how it would be possible. But I am amazed at how the story has been flushed out. Many of the details of what has happened in Middle Earth are included in this film, so the audience is given a clearer of what's happening in the story. The action in this film is a great roller coaster ride of adventure. It is less epic than The Lord of the Rings movies, as the novel is less epic than The Lord of the Rings books. Martin Freeman is excellent as Bilbo Bagins. He truly portrays Bilbo's struggles with his desires to stay home in comfort and his desires for a great adventure. Ian McKellan delivers a fantastic performance as Gandalf. Sylvester McCoy as the brown wizard is not to be missed. If you're a fan of Middle Earth you've got to see this movie.

The 2D is only one disc. The 3D had some crossover and blurring. However, there are some very clear 3D images and some rather poor. I think it's worth the extra mere $11.00 to pick up the 3D combo pack. I just purchased the ""Prometheus"" movie in 3D which was tremendously superior to Hobbit 3D. I have many 3D movies, some awesome, some awful. THEN THERE'S THE DARK SUNGLASSES!! I have shutter glasses with a 55"" LED LCD Samsung 8000 model.

4638646,4,B0059XTU1S,"This movie started off slow, with a series of prologues dealing with the founding of the Dwarven city and the coming of the dragon Smaug, which we, alas, never truly get to see. Then its off to Hobbitton to meet our favorite Hobbits and a slightly younger Gandalf The Dwarves seem a bit more comical than need be, especially the one with the really odd hat who uses a Dennis the Menace style slingshot that is absolutely useless in battle. He's like the Jar-Jar Binks of the group. NO movie needs a Jar-Jar. I'm hoping he's dragon chow in the next film. The rest of the cast is great though.  Some of the best bits in the movie are in the prologue with the finding of the Arkenstone, the scenery, the fight with the Necromancer, and the Rivendell stuff. Especially the scene where Saruman tries to use his Voice on the Elven High Council and they are not having any of that. Of course, the best part of all is the part where Bilbo finds the Ring and meets Gollum. I liked it and can't wait to see what's in the extended version when that comes out.
The bonus features were also good. These were production blogs that were about bits and pieces of the ""making of"" process"". The best parts of these were the ones discussion and showing the scenery and locations used in the film. Just amazing. They went to all new and different parts of New Zealand for this film than they had been before. Also, Hobbiton is now a permanent tourist destination in New Zealand.

A couple extra bits: I am not a fan of 3-D. It was great in Avatar, and there is no point in every movie needing to be in 3-D. You don't need it in the Hobbit.",1364515200,2,1619,4.304918032786885

It stands on it's own and can be read in a matter of hours. I was a bit let down at the end realizing I was going to have wait for the next two films to release. However, it did explain why the beginning was so dang long, a bit too long in fact. Overall, I loved what they did with the screenplay.

4638673,5,B0059XTU1S,"I think it bears mentioning that the world (and the USA in particular) had a whole decade in which to get even more jaded and cynical than it already was when the last LOTR film was released, so I was expecting a culture that might be a bit more indifferent to the wondrous, exquisite first film in Jackson's 'Hobbit' trilogy. I was correct, but pay no attention to the world. This film is as astounding and as full of authentic Tolkien spirit as any of the LOTR classics, more than able to shift gears to accommodate the completely different (but obviously interrelated) story of Bilbo's unique adventure. Just as Tolkien's 'Hobbit' was child-like and spare due to its narration by a simple Hobbit, there is necessarily a more buoyant, child-like spirit to this film (if one must compare it to the LOTR set), but it's hardly spare and do not think for a moment that it lacks the gravitas, creativity, whimsy, and inspiration of the other films. Many of our old heroes return, and some new ones are born. McKellan still thrills as lovably crusty Gandalf, wise beyond thought. Blanchett is more radiant than ever in her Galadriel cameo. The dwarves are outstanding to the last, with Thorin Oakenshield becoming a complex and worthy hero to rival Aragorn in the first films. Respect and deep care for the source-material is evident everywhere, from the still-majestic cinematography to the score to the writing to the casting. Our younger Bilbo is a gem -- easily winning hearts and our faith, as viewers, in a role that surely daunted, given Ian Holm's indelible first-impression. The effects, in a world that has become trapped in a love/hate relationship with effects, still astound due to the sensible craftsmanship. Poetic license remains poetic; Radagast and his racing Rhosgobel rabbits are a winsome joy and quite well-conceived. The action scenes are as awe-inspiring as ever, whether under the Misty Mountain in the domain of the Goblin King (fab VoiceOver by the legend Barry Humphries!) or at cliff's edge as wargs close-in on our intrepid band. If I were to detract a star it might be for pacing--there are a few minor hump-spots--but it wouldn't be for content, so five stars. The film resonates with luminous wonder and leaves so many other contemporary offerings in the dust, in terms of quality and spectacle. The Warner money-grab in December is annoying but to be expected, and I can't comment on corporate greed in giving a review about this product in and of itself. This Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultra package is THE MOVIE and it is cherished. Enjoy fabulous storytelling/film-making like this before the entire world goes off the boil and no one has so much as a clue about what's decent and worthy any longer.",1364515200,,2718,4.8725701943844495

The star off is for the digital version that comes with the disc.  It's a low quality (non HD, not even DVD quality) copy that plays in Flixter's own player.  I get better picture quality on Netflix non HD streaming shows and movies.  You have to use their player, their service and it's presented in a letterbox format with no options for widescreen.

It has been years since I read the book but as I watched I found myself wondering where in the book some of the things that were happening in the movie were. Did I somehow miss this stuff when reading the book?

The scenes in the Shire at the beginning was so slow and dull that I stopped watching on the first evening. Since I had paid good money for the DVD, I tried to watch again the next evening in hopes that things would pick up. No such luck. I finally shut it down during the scene in the cave with Bilbo and the Gollum and switched on the paint drying channel for some excitement.

I'm going to try to return the DVD to Amazon as defective since it did not work as expected - to cause any interest at all.

This movie was a disappointment  - so much so that I will have to dig out my copy and read it again to cleanse my now tarnished remembrance of the classic book that was The Hobbit.",1364428800,11,1033,4.019512195121951

4638685,1,B0059XTU1S,"Like many other viewers I loved the Ring Trilogy. Was hopping to add the Hobbit to my collection, I will not buy this movie. I borrowed a friends copy to see if I would like it. Where do we start with how bad this movie was. It was such a disappointment in comparison to the other three. You would have thought after the 3 that this one would just blow your mind. As it was the first 85 minutes of it just drug on. I watch videos while I elliptical and I joked that I was almost up to a whole Lord of the Rings on it. Figured the Hobbit would get me there. I struggled to stay engaged during the first 85 minutes. The last 65 minutes was just so painful. I got off the machine just as the dragon opened its eye in disgust. Had to watch the first Lord of The Rings this morning just to get the bad taste out of my mouth and the horribleness of the awful makeup out of my head.

Lets start with the makeup on the dwarves can we say horrible and something my 3 year old grandson could have done. The bald one his name escapes me right now he looked like he got out of the makeup chair to early and was left partially undone. The rest of them just looked like cartoon characters with odd hair dos.

There was a heavy reliance on CG and man it showed.  The movie labored along at a snails crawl. Maybe they got so caught up in the graphics that they forgot that the audience needs to feel something for the characters for us to feel invested in their survival and that we would want to come back at a later time to see how there fared, meaning go see them at the movies or buy the DVD's.  This one needed a wheelbarrow to help carry it. They could have cut 85 minutes off and made it tighter and maybe not so bloody awful.  I remembered back to my first Lord of The Rings and you bonded with most of the characters right away. The cast was a tight knit group with their own unique personalities. Thank goodness for Gandalf he was the only cohesive bit to the movie. Although it seems he was limited to always saying ""Run"" he did have other words but that seems to sum up most of his input.

Every time young Bilbo opened his mouth it was to whine about something. I kept hoping they would truss him up and stuff something in his mouth. He had the same expression throughout the movie. The expression on the box and that is what his character was a wooden box. Couldn't feel nor did I care about the plight of any of the other members of this team. There was constant bickering with no cause. Kept hoping it would get better that the last 30 minutes would at least redeem it, no such luck. It was only because of my personal work out goal did I keep watching.

I think they covered every way to run and either tumble down the side of a mountain, off a tree off or something else. They spent more time sliding down something. The other creatures just looked so cartoonish and backwards. The beauty and elegance of the other movies from the trilogy were not in this one at all. Yes there were ugly fight scenes and gross monsters but they looked complete the characters were finished. The Hobbit sorely lacked any of the polish that we have come to expect of the others in the Ring trilogy.

Not to say that there we not good moments in this movie. There were some cute one liners. And of course the scenery was stunning as ever. Gollum while he's a bit of an acquired taste added some much needed life. HIs eyes were so eloquent when Bilbo was deciding his fate unbeknownst to him. I felt more of a connection to his character than any of the others. The Great Eagles were absolutely amazing. Lets not forget Galadriel elf queen she is absolutely breathtaking as always, ray of light in all that is dark. Some of the new characters were interesting but they just felt like add ons and not complete characters at all.

This movie should not have been reduced to moments there was potential for so much. If they are going to drag out this movie into 2 more parts I think I will pass. I was so disappointed in the movie that it made me a bit cross all day. I returned it immediately to my friend...Unfortunately they got the brunt of my review verbally.  I had to buy lunch as an apology...I figured writing about it would be more productive so I can move on.  They coasted on this one and I do not feel like investing in what happens next.",1364428800,14,4330,4.1923076923076925

4638687,5,B0059XTU1S,"Being a fan of Tolkien, I am happy to note that Mr. Jackson has again undertaken another quality film creation of Tolkien's work. Though The Hobbit has a different feel than The Lord of The Rings, it seems to fit well with the other films. It has more of an innocent sense of adventure to it. The character of Bilbo helps greatly in this respect. He is a believable unwilling--yet tempted--adventurer.

Gollum is another character who must deliver a realistic performance in order for us to accept that this story is reasonable and faithful to Tolkien's intent. His portrayal, a mix of animation and live action voice and movement, is easily believable. As in The Lord of The rings, his character is a solid blend of malice and pitiable existence. I felt both revolted by him and sad for him.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with what appears to be a significant amount of animation, especially with the character Azog. Perhaps I am wrong, but I feel that there was a fair amount of this film work in this movie. Perhaps there was more animation in The Lord of The Rings trilogy than I caught on to; this movie is not so subtle in that regard.

All-in-all, this is a fun movie! I will happily watch the other two installments and, as I did with The Lord of The Rings, I will look to purchase the extended versions if they are available.

4638696,3,B0059XTU1S,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is director Peter Jackson's lengthy adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novel.  Taking place 60 years before the events in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it follows the adventures of young hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who's recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) to help a gang of rowdy dwarves reclaim their mountain home.

Jackson's plan to break down ""The Hobbit"" into three feature-film installments may tax the patience of his core audience.  The first hour plays very much like a kids' flick. Though the movie does turn darker and more dramatic, the director veers considerably from the well known book in an attempt to add spectacle and endow some characters with loftier motives than Tolkien envisioned.  As in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, the cinematography and production design are impressive, but the running time makes this fantasy a long slog.

A deluxe five-disc edition contains Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD, and Digital Copy.  Bonus extras include Jackson's making-of production videos; featurettes on the start of production, location scouting, and filming in 3D; post-production overview; and footage of the world premiere in Wellington, New Zealand.

So, some people may totally disregard this review, and that is okay!  I just really enjoyed the backstory to the LOTR series and felt that the story line made the other movies make perfect sense.

4638698,4,B0059XTU1S,"This movie doesn't stray too far from the formula that made the Lord of the Rings franchise so popular. It IS a bit more fanciful and tongue-in-cheek than LOTR, having stripped away some of the grime, grit, and dark-corners, but that doesn't ruin the rich feel or lively characters most fans would expect.

There were quite a few liberties taken with the storyline when compared with the original book. I assume this was to flesh out the story, removing some large gaps of [yawn] boring character development, but I can't help feeling that this was also a financial decision, driven by the need to make a not-so-long book into a three part cash cow.

All in all, this was a lovely romp allowing us to once again glimpse into J. R. R. Tolkien's long forgotten realm of Middle Earth.

4638704,5,B0059XTU1S,"THE 2-D BLURAY DISC
I'd award two extra stars if I could for the Bluray disc (which probably applies to the DVD too) because the movie LOADS QUICKLY and PLAYS QUICKLY.  A animated loading symbol is shown for the 10 or 20 seconds it takes to load.  Then quick flash of the Warner Brother's screen and you are at the main menu.  Press ""play"", two anti-piracy screens appear for a few seconds each, and the movie begins. That's all.  THREE CHEERS FOR WARNER BROTHERS!!!!

In contrast, Sony's ""Men in Black 3"" (by no means the most annoying Bluray I've purchased lately) takes forever to load, leaving you with a blank black screen while loading, then several ""previews"" of other movies you have to fast-forward through (because the ""disc menu"" button is disabled), then 4 (FOUR!!!!) long antipiracy screens, then a long general disclaimer screen, then a disclaimer screen regarding internet features.  All Sony disc are like this.  Many other Blurays and movie companies/distributors are worse, I've had to fast forward through seemingly a dozen ""previews"" on other discs each; others have opening screen after screen of distributors, producers, and contributors (such as THX for the sound processing).  Many anti-piracy screens seem to hold for 30 seconds or so.  On one disc, I had to choose ""Language"" before I could get to the menu.  Why do we tolerate this crap??  Because we have no choice.

THE HOBBIT MOVIE
THE BAD
> The good news is that surely there will be no ""extended edition"" to buy in a few years.  In fact, I'm kinda hoping for a ""condensed"" edition.  The movie is just too long with too many exaggerated chase scenes.  There is just so much adrenaline the body can absorb---I've already crashed by the time the movie is at the 2/3rds point.
> I was particularly annoyed by the grossly overlong, cartoonish chase scenes in the orc cave, which must have been 10,000s of hours of CGI at a cost of $10s millions of dollars.  About 1/4 the length would have been fine.

THE GOOD
> The Bluray is absolutely stunning--razor sharp.  The cinemaphotography is superb.  The CGI seemless.
> The introduction, with the ""Lord of the Rings"" Bilbo and Frodo is a stroke of genius.
> The trolls sequence reminded me of ny High School years, long long ago.  Actually, the dwarves and orcs were a bit unpleasantly ""familiar"".
> The actor playing (young) Bilbo is terrific.
> Although I'd have prefered a version truer to the book, most of the additions are from the unreadable ""Silmarillion"" and other Tolkien material, and make the story more consistent as a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"".  I suspect that if Tolkien himself had had a chance to re-write the Hobbit, he would have done something similar.

EVALUATION
Like many reviewers, if I were in control, the movie would have followed the book more closely, would have been better paced, and would have been more adult.  BUT it is what it is, and what it is is MAGNIFICIENT.

3D?
Why not?  If it's only a few bucks more and comes with the 2D Bluray.  No doubt the 3D version is spectacular.  But I didn't consider the 3D.  As it happens I have a $5000 state-of-the-art 3D capable system, but every 3D movie I've seen (including Avitar) gives me a migraine headache within 20 minutes.  The fact is, regardless of the claims of producers who've dumped $10s of millions into developing 3D cameras and technology, 3D movies simply are not filmed the way the human eye sees and interprets 3D.  If you see 3D, your mind assumes that you can selectively focus on any part of the scene you want, say on the background, even if the action is in the foreground---but you actually can't---because the background is intentionally out-of-focus, so you brain is in constant conflict with your eyes, telling your eyes to focus on things that it can't.  If you veiw an image that is only 2D (as in a photograph or an ordinary 2D movie) your mind takes 3D cues from sharpness of focus, proportions, etc. and ""reads"" 3D into 2D images, without any eyestrain.  A real 3D experience would require the entire image (foreground, subject, and background) to be in perfect sharp focus.  But if a movie was shot that way (with no selective focus), it would look completely flat in 2D. Note that the few successful 3D movies out there are either ""landscape shots"" where everything is in focus, or fast action, where you are so busy following the subject (which is in focus), that your mind doesn't have a chance to be confused by out-of-focus elements.  The Hobbit is a mixture of landscapes and fast action, so it probably works better in 3D than most movies.

I am one of those in the minority who actually likes the movie.  I enjoy it more and more with each viewing and would give the movie itself a four star rating.  The one-star rating, however, has to do with the 3-DVD package, particularly the Ultraviolet download.  I have an Ultraviolet account and know that it is not compatible with my particular iPod.  That is not my complaint.  My complaint is that I paid extra for the digital copy, and, lo and behold, I cannot play it on my computer.  Why?  Because apparently there is a bug in the software with Flixster or UV which prevents the license for the movie from being retrieved.  So the downloaded copy will not play.  I have to go on-line to play it.  So much for portability.  Tech support says they will look into the matter, but that instills no confidence in me. It seems this is a common issue with Flixster as they have a post concerning the matter in their FAQ section.  Their answer is that it will be corrected in the next update.  Uh ... sure.  In the meantime, I recommend you save yourself the hassle and heartache and avoid the 3-DVD combo pack.

Update:  It is more than a month later, an Flixter / Ultraviolet update has come and gone, and Ultraviolet STILL has not resolved the issue with the download.  DO NOT BUY ULTRAVIOLET UNDER ANY CONDITIONS.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NONEXISTENT.",1364342400,2,1641,5.290697674418604

4638726,5,B0059XTU1S,"A little more than a year ago, I wrote a gag review on this film and posted it under the book title just as a subtly humorous attempt to keep Sir Peter straight which I am certain he never read. My prophecies generally all came true. Some features were good, some were bad, some are arguable, depending upon what one values in a film.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This movie is a fantasy-adventure, but not animated. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of The Shire, is recruited by Gandalf the Wizard to serve a dozen dwarfs as a ""burglar"" that they might journey to their former homeland on a great quest to reclaim the region as well as all the treasure which was seized by Smaug the Dragon. If you wish to see the ultimate battle, you'll have to stand by for about two years as this is only the first entry of two more films to come.

The screenplay was extracted from J.R.R. Tolkien's fairy tale,*The Hobbit* which was initially published to massive popularity in 1937. Tolkien went on to publish *The Lord of the Rings*, (which was released as a trilogy in 1954-55), which picked up the Hobbit tale, (with a notably darker ambiance), and continued the story of Middle Earth.

EVALUATIVE SUMMARY: One of the foremost failings with having the top people writing a screenplay, (in this case it was chiefly Director Sir Peter Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and family friend Philippa Boyens), is that there remains no objective person to influentially criticize the finished product. Even when others might offer useful and compelling opinions, the thoughts of these top people will always prevail. As a result, some nuances of this film do not benefit the overall work, (and in fact diminish it in terms of art), and this fact becomes blatantly evident to anyone who has considerable life experience with the foibles of people and their predictable behaviors.

To be specific, the gifted Director Peter Jackson, teaming with the generally odious Hollywood moguls, clearly leaned much more heavily upon the profit-motivation aspect of this film, showing copiously less concern for the artfulness of the production which we witnessed with the earlier three *The Lord of the Rings* films. Up until the final moments, there were to be only TWO Hobbit films, (which was already twice the length required from my view.) That was apparently when the actuality hit them that they had inadvertently generated enough footage to stretch the financial proceeds even further by contriving *three* epic-length films and thus the dreaded announcement was issued with joyous enthusiasm.

Here are the points which I find particularly objectionable regarding this film, (and no doubt to some unknown degree in the two anticipated films.)

1. *The Hobbit* does not limit itself to the expected periodic comic relief - specifically, it bulges with low-brow one-liners and *The Three Stooges* -type slapstick undergraduate humor which the typical non-thinker savors so much these days. Most of these dubious witticisms manifest the additional flaw of being anachronistic in nature, detracting mightily from the script.

2. The special effects, while quite professionally crafted, are unreservedly over-the-top and, at least for my tastes, reek of the diminutive Hollywood mentality. To put it bluntly, I seriously doubt that Professor Tolkien would have approved and I'll wager that even Peter Jackson, his eye on the paycheck, felt pangs of guilt.

3. The inspired composer, Howard Shore, accepted a milk run on this one. Peter Jackson nearly annihilated him with unrelenting deadlines during the previous trilogy. I think Mr. Shore wised up in this instance and considered, ""People are going to make a *lot* of money on this film, people who will not be working their guts out as I did the last time around - so I'm not going to do it this time."" And he didn't. One could hardly blame him. Goodwill can only be stretched so far. Most of the music here is recycled work from the previous trilogy. Yes, I understand the need to link the films, leitmotifs, etc., but so much of the film-score is precisely the same product, note for note, and could have been manipulated just a little.

4. As it was clearly going to be necessary to stretch this tiny fairy tale in order to achieve three epic-length films, the movie integrates a glut of Hollywood fluff, (likely brain-gas hatched from Boyens' head, a person who could rationalize the activities of Pol Pot), the misdeed having been perpetrated on quite a monumental scale. The writers inserted a dark underlying scheme, for example, which supports the prelude to Sauron of the previous trilogy. This theme gave rise to all manner of opportunities which simply do not appear in the source work. As for the exploitation of dramatic license in re-working how certain events of the original book actually transpired, some of these scenes were well-done and some are entirely tasteless. Any thinking person can instantly determine which are which.

Lesser misadventures with this film are equally evident but, in the interest of brevity, not worth enumerating.

Overall, I was entertained by the film and it was certainly worth the nineteen bucks I paid for it at Wal-Mart. I thought that Sylvester McCoy's performance as Radagast the Brown was terrific. The former *Doctor Who* outshone most of the others. I do feel compelled to note that Cate Blanchette's work was something short of mediocre but, if she failed, most of the blame falls upon the writers. She's no longer stunning enough to simply stand around and look like a fairy princess which is what appears to have been attempted. Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo Baggins was magnificent. His appearance, in regard to linking up with that of Ian Holm who plays the older Bilbo, was nothing short of sterling. So, Kudos to Peter Jackson on the overall casting.

As I anticipated, the New Zealand landscapes were nothing short of astonishing and they added a remarkable ambiance to the movie. Peter Jackson demonstrates an imaginative eye for using just the right location for a shot. The costumes and make-up were pretty good, perhaps appearing just a bit dreadfully outlandish in the case of the dwarves. Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield doesn't look like a dwarf in any sense which is equally true of a couple of the younger dwarfs, Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Kili (Aidan Turner); however, I did not view these three caveats as taking away from the film in any sense as their acting was largely first-rate, after accounting for dull-witted screenwriting.

I don't wish to belabor any of the points I have introduced here. Some, (chiefly the young who attend the cinema with frequency), will see them quite differently. I come from a classic film and classic literature background so that is the basis for my views.

A quick word on the second disc: You'll get two things, including the nine ""how we did it"" clips [blogs] which you can already watch for free on You Tube and, a somewhat commercial travelogue of New Zealand that only tenuously links to the making of the film. It's more of a tourism promotion but still informative and well-done. Somehow, one also gets an upload of the film to one's computer by entering a code which comes with the DVD. I don't know how to do this and will not bother but others might enjoy this feature.

In summary, the movie is much darker and considerably more oriented toward adult views than the material of the original book, which was written for children. *The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey* is a fun and entertaining movie; however, it will definitely not withstand the test of time as will *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy of films which were all exponentially superior to this Peter Jackson entry.

It was great to see Gandalf again, and Golem and Saruman and Elrond, and Martin Freeman, as Bilbo, is a born hobbit; but a good deal of material not in the book has been added, making the movie feel over-padded and overcooked, all to make three movies out of it instead of the one, or at most two, that it should have been.  The book is a charming prequel to the Lord of the Rings, not a rival to it, and so should have been the movie.  Note to Peter Jackson:  Five minutes of Gandalf and his party being chased through underground chasms by the bad guys being good in Lord of the Rings doesn't make fifteen minutes of it with over the top sets and special effects better in The Hobbit.

4638741,4,B0059XTU1S,"I'm a Hobbit fan but not a mega fan like most. I have been a big fan of Peter Jackson and this endeavor of making a trilogy out of the shortest LOR books seemed disappointingly an adventure to maximizing more revenue. It may be true however I thoroughly enjoyed the Hobbit may be even better than the other 3 LORs. Martin Freeman is such an accomplished actor than Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. The latter pair's scenes in previous LORs were just painful to watch. So much eye staring and close ups of them staring into each other's eyes. So even though the Hobbit was at a very slow pace it was enjoyable. I guess I like being swallowed whole into the Hobbit landscape. Peter Jackson said that was his intent to spend more time in the homes and in the company of Dwarves. The acting is of higher caliber and of course the wizard Gandalf steals any scene he walks in. I saw it at my favorite Cinerama in 3D HFR. HFR didn't reveal any costume or make up flaws like some fans exclaimed. In fact I was amazed at the detail and proficiency of the make up & costumes especially through the action scenes.

I thought the story, acting, scenery, cinematography, and directing was unmatched. Who could have thought anyone could make this work of art into a film with such perfection?

Peter Jackson does the same magic the Hobbit. I'm sure anyone reading this is familiar with the story so I won't go into it here. I was dazzled and amazed at the beauty of the story and attention to detail. Martin Freeman as a young Bilbo was genius casting, and Richard Armitage was a stand out as Thorin. Ian McKellen, as usual, was perfection as Gandalf.

My absolute favorite scene in the movie was Bilbo's encounter with Gollum. You just have to see it for yourself.

Is this for everyone? No-if you are not into character study, attention to detail, and sitting back to just take in the beauty of the scenery this movie is probably not for you.

I have different DVD's, some are not very new - and they have much crispier picture. I made a few screen-shots - the size turned out to be normal for DVD (853x480). I don't know what's causing this.

This time we take a single 240 page book and we stretch it out into 3 separate movies. Release each one about a year apart, and then allow people to purchase each one for $35.00+ a piece after they have all been shown in the theatres. I (unfortunately) never saw The Hobbit in the theatres when it was released, so I was duped into purchasing the DVD/BlueRay set when it went on sale. I am old enough to remember the ""original"" animated movie The Hobbit that was originally shown on T.V. and it was superb for its time. So why (other than just being plain greedy) do we need to take a 2 hr. movie (with commercials at that) and stretch it out into 3 separate 240 minute movies??? Why else......

So, we ended up hooking up the iPad to our speakers and watching it on that tiny screen. Boo, Amazon! We had limited time to watch it, so the waiting in between each new try and getting error messages was not fun. Amazon's email ""tech support"" was lame and Johnny come lately. Never had this issue before, but I wish they had sent a personal email saying, gee, sorry you had to watch this EPIC movie on your tiny screen with cables stretched across your living room for good sound.

I went back through the descriptions and there is no mention that this is only part of the story.  From the reviews, it sounds like the full story will be available in December, but it would be nice if the description mentioned this.

I was never a big fan of the Hobbit by itself.  Having listened to the many BBC / Radio Play renditions and accept that Producers/Directors are going to change things from the book, I found what there was of the story entertaining and the padding scenes helped.

The strongest points in the movies are drawing in the ancillary topcis, like Radagast, Witch of Angmar etc.  All action scenes are turned up to 11 which while visually impressive makes the tale an even taller tale than the original.  There were a few tease glimpses of Smaug that for what was shown weren't overly impressive but I should withhold judgement until the full beast can be seen on screen in the sequels.

Two is probably fine, but three is probably just dragging it out.  We'll have to see the others to know for sure.

The story is on an epic scale with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but has a younger audience in mind.  The humor in the story is a bit ""tweenish"" but the movie has a more adult undertone and has some fairly uneventful/story-less scenes that provides little content (think about the extended versions of the originals that provided little additional content).  I almost put it on par with Star Wars Episode 1, you can't help be left a bit disappointed when comparing it to the LOTR trilogy.  The special effects in areas also do not feel up to par with the original series (but are still very good).  At almost 3 hours, it was just too long for what the story accomplished in the first part.

Ultimately after sifting through the critical reviews I found that most of the gripes were with the way Peter Jackson shot the film in 48p as opposed to the standard 24p.  The effect that creates is very soap opera looking, for those who leave motionflow on with their televisions they will not notice a thing.  Personally I hate motionflow and have it disabled on my set, thus resulting in a much more natural and filmlike effect when compared to on which I feel makes it look like video.  Personally do not understand how that changes the film as a whole or why some reviewers felt compelled to bash it for that.

As far as the movie goes, it is not perfect by any means...but I feel that I can safely say to any LOTR fans that they should enjoy this flick.  I have already watched it twice and expect to watch it a few more times.  Picture quality is outstanding and the surround is equally impressive.  I don't want to give anything away about the movie itself but I feel the action is spread out nicely.  Highly recommended by this LOTR fan!",1364169600,,1215,4.486363636363636

4638836,5,B0059XTU1S,It's hard not to love this movie if you love Tolkien  I have read some reviews that mentioned it was slow and lacking content. Many others voiced concern that you would be hard pressed to squeeze out a trilogy out of a single book. I enjoyed this movie it was not slow it fleshed out characters that are very interesting and had plenty of action scenes as well. I would say if you liked The Lord of the rings movies you will like this as well. These are all long movies that develop characters more than the average movie of our time so if that appeals to you you will enjoy it.,1364169600,,578,4.160714285714286
4638837,4,B0059XTU1S,I was surprised they did not include the Desolation of Smaug. I read the book the Hobbit and thought I was buying the entire book not just the first half. This was a disappointment.,1364169600,,181,4.352941176470588
4638838,4,B0059XTU1S,"I have the Blu-ray combo pack I bought using gift cards.  I had not seen this in the theater and just pre-ordered it with some gift cards I had received during Christmas.  I loved the LOTR and have the extended version on Blu-ray as well but had purchased that after the UV copy was no longer available, so this was my first UV experience.  I'll comment on that separately.  I also watched some extra's that were included prior to receiving the actual movie -  I think it was called ""The Hobbit, the journey begins"" or something similar which peaked my interest but only so much.

Blu-Ray Movie:  first, just don't expect the epic that LOTR was.  The Hobbit is a prelude to the LOTR and explains how Bilbo found the Ring.  The books had the Hobbit as a lot more light-hearted than the LOTR trilogy.  So you don't have these massive armies attacking each other or even a sense of urgency in this adventure.  The start lays out the background of Lonely Mountain and how the dwarves were driven from it by Smaug - who you don't get to see a lot of in this film.  The dwarves themselves are a bit comical except for Thorin who is dead serious.  There are a few foes that have more development than the LOTR movies had - for instance trolls discussing how to cook & eat dwarves, orcs chasing the dwarves for revenge, goblins who have some dialect in the movie.
  That said there are some things that are being introduced as ""lead ins"" for LOTR (of course the movie starts with Bilbo's going away party and him talking to Frodo, so you can say this is him telling his story - i.e. what he was writing in his book).  The problem is of course the LOTR has already been released and most likely if you are wanting to see the Hobbit it is because you saw LOTR.  The reason that is a problem is because LOTR is about the ""dark"" times and the war that is being waged.  The Hobbit is a ""lighter"" time and the war has not started yet.  It is also going to be hard to judge from the first movie (I am surprised it's taking 3 to tell the story as I thought 2 would suffice).  I think a lot went into explaining the background in this first movie.  They haven't even made it to Mirkwood yet.
  I can't imagine how they could have extended versions also planned but I guess there is a lot of material to work with so they'll have something to squeeze in there to help squeeze your wallet :)
  Bottom line is I enjoyed the movie and knew I wanted to get the series to add to my LOTR Blu-ray set.  I just think I'm going to keep each one as it comes out and not bother with the extended version this time.  You really have to decide if you want it now or if renting (or borrowing from a friend) would suffice until the ""set"" or extended version(s) are all available.

UV: This was an issue for me. As stated previously I had not used UV copies prior to this.  I went to the website as directed and started entering information.  I saw you could use your google account so I tried that.  Everything worked for Flixster (you apparently need flixster to watch the UV copy) and then I had to setup and link the UV account.  That's when things started to go wrong.  Somehow two accounts were generated with my gmail/google account.  I eventually got it worked out and then things seemed to work fine until I tried to watch my movie.  I kept getting prompted to enter a password for flixster because (according to the site) it was safer instead of just using my google account.  Problem was it wouldn't take any password I tried to assign it.  I gave up and canceled the account and setup a new one using a different email address instead of the gmail account.  Now it finally works.  The movie is in SD and not HD at this time.  I also cannot download it to my mobile phone because flixster doesn't support it for HTC phones (I have the flixster app on my phone).

Extra Features on Blu-ray: I finally had time to sit and watch the extra features.  The Hobbit: The journey begins I had actually already downloaded and watch as part of the ""package"" and it is about 30 minutes or so.  There are also video blogs which were interesting to watch.  They included all of the trailers but those got a bit repetitive with just the last part changing.  And there was also game trailers.  There was a code to watch the 3/24 Q&A with Jackson and although I missed the time I was still able to access the content and watch it this last Friday (3/29).  I was a bit let down as I didn't get a sneak peek at Smaug so I guess I have to wait.

So it probably would have been better if it had been released prior to the LOTR but as long as you can keep in mind this is prior to the war and a ""happier"" time, then you can perhaps enjoy the movie.  Also this first movie spends a lot of time setting up the history - it can be argued it spent too much time and perhaps all the material being added is being done so to justify making three movies.  Of course if you felt like you couldn't get enough of Middle Earth then the ""extra"" intro will perhaps satisfy some of your need.  It also would have been better (for me) if I could download the movie to my mobile device instead of streaming, but I guess it's in the cloud so as long as I can access WiFi I guess I can ""watch"" it but really prefer the download to avoid ""buffering"" and waiting...

4638846,3,B0059XTU1S,"I am very familiar with Tolkien's work, having read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings several times, as well as the Silmarillion.  The Hobbit, of course, is in a sense a prequel to the Lord of the Rings, having been written by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins' uncle.  The movie follows the general course of the book, without too many deviations, beginning with an unexpected party and moving from there.  There is a little contrived conflict, with Thorin resisting visiting Rivendell and a little back story fleshing out, with a meeting of the White Council.  Another, more major change, was the creation of Azog, as the main antagonist to Thorin Oakenshield (in the LOTR appendixes, Dain of the Iron Hills killed Azog and it was his son Bolg who lead the attacking orcs), not a big deal though.

Peter Jackson has spent an awful lot of time making certain that the Middle Earth landscape and cultures are true to the books.  The cinematography is amazing and the New Zealand landscape shines in the movie.  For a fan of Tolkien it is a real treat to revisit these places with Jackson.

That said, the movie is just too long.  I was afraid of this, when Jackson announced that there ""was just too much material for two films"" and he was making the Hobbit into three films.

The Hobbit deviates significantly from the ""feel"" of the Hobbit as a book.  The book was a light hearted jaunt, with several battle scenes, but with much humor thrown in -- more of a children's story, really.  On the other hand, the movie emphasizes fight scenes.  However, the biggest difference to me, is in the characters of Bilbo and the dwarves.  Tolkien shows the dwarves to be bumblers, constantly getting into trouble, requiring Gandalf or Bilbo to rescue them time after time.  In the movie, Jackson reveals them to be battle hardened warriors, who each can single handedly take out half an orc regiment.  Even Bilbo is pretty handy with his small sword, Sting, and battles a couple of orcs to a stand still.

Large sections of the movie feel like montages from a video game, with the dwarves and Gandalf decapitating and eviscerating hundreds of orcs.  And while the CGI effects are very nicely done, all of this escapes one of the central themes of the book, which is that small people with big hearts, lots of courage and a little bit of luck can make big differences in the world.

In the end, I enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it again, but it really felt like too little material stretched thin.",1364169600,31,2495,4.616780045351474

4638862,5,B0059XTU1S,"As a major fan of this book, I was eagerly anticipating this 3d blu ray release as I had not had the chance to see this in the movie theaters.

For the movie itself, I was not anticipating the additions Peter Jackson and his team placed into the prequel story line that were not in the Hobbit book.  Yet, these additions were a very nice surprise.  In the end, this is one of my favorite books and a lot of love went into making this script and movie.  I must say, I will be a fan of watching this movie multiple times.

I want to hit most on 3d for this movie as I have not seen many customer reviews specific to 3d.  In general, the wide screen format 16 X 9 2.40 aspect ratio is not preferred in my opinion for 3d.  I have a 55 inch TV and still would rather see the entire screen in 3d glory as Avatar and Avengers recently did.

That is my only gripe and it's a small one.  Let me start by saying this may be my favorite 3d movie made to date.  I say this because there is such a focus on depth in this 3d experience and it adds an experience you could not get with 2d viewing.  There are several scenes that really pop in my mind when thinking about this.

There is one scene where Gollum is chasing Bilbo and he is about 50 feet away creeping behind a rock to find him.  The depth of the cavernous hallway and Gollum's eerie eyes on Bilbo was fantastic and I don't believe you could have achieved this type of visual without the 3d capability.

Next, the chase scene of the goblins in the Misty Mountains was incredible.  I do believe that the visual effects achieved in Peter Jacksons King Kong movie were put to good work in the Hobbit and 3d again provided depth and perspective you could not achieve otherwise.

The crisp details of this 3d experience were top notch and certainly deserve to sit with the best of your 3d library.  I did not see one episode of ghosting and I was looking for it.

In short, this movie exceeded my expectations in every way, was an amazing start to what is likely to be a phenomenal trilogy and provides a must see 3d experience.

I eagerly anticipate the next movie.",1364169600,,2109,4.175742574257426

With expectations at an enormous high, a 48fps experiment in tow, and fandom, both literary and cinematic, frothing at the mouth, poised to strike the moment the first film in The Hobbit trilogy showed the slightest sign of weakness, it was bound to disappoint. And yet it shouldn't have. Criticism continues to run the gamut. Too long! Too slow! Too expansive! Like butter scraped over too much bread! Was anyone really that surprised to see Jackson and company indulge a little? Did the decision to stretch two films into three fail to clue anyone into the fact that An Unexpected Journey would be more akin to a Lord of the Rings extended version than a lean, mean theatrical cut? For that matter, are the same people who swear by The Lord of the Rings Extended Editions actually upset with the end result? By some strange, blinding magic: yes, yes and yes.

Fortunately, it was only bound to disappoint some fans. There are those among us who chose a different path. Those who were familiar with the quaint, charming tale of ""The Hobbit,"" enough so to avoid setting Rings-slaying expectations. Who didn't squander our first viewing of An Unexpected Journey by leaping headlong into an entirely new (and arguably distracting) way of watching a film. Who were overjoyed to immerse ourselves in Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth once again, for whatever length of time he saw fit. No, The Hobbit isn't perfect. It isn't a sacred adaptation of Tolkien's text, or even one that rivals any of The Lord of the Rings films. It's a gorgeous, gripping, at-times enthralling return to Middle-Earth, though, with far more to offer the Peter Jackson and J.R.R.

I wanted to enjoy this movie, but found myself rolling my eyes in frustration.  Seems too much spacer material, not enough dialogue,  poor character development.  This movie had the potential.... but Jackson had to overdue it.  I feel if Guillermo del Toro had directed it the end results would be far superior.

Jackson almost whores this movie out to promote LOR.... there are only a few things the two have in common: ring, characters, and a few items.  The cameos are stupid and do nothing for the movie.

Save your money... Jackson is just trying to pull a Lucas and recycle old material and claim its new while exploiting the consumer to make millions.",1364169600,2,836,4.710344827586207
4638878,2,B0059XTU1S,"Since I had heard both negative and positive reviews before watching, I went into this with no expectations of it adhering closely to the book, nor did I have any intentions of comparing the Hobbit to the LOTR trilogy. That being said, all throughout, there seemed to be a needless theme of Peter Jackson making those comparisons for us - The Hobbit is meant to be a more lighthearted tale, but time and again extra scenes were included that made the attempt to resemble LOTR both visually and with the theme of darkness and oppression. Even that I would have forgiven had the pacing not been so torturous. From the first fifteen minutes onward, even during those few instances when this movie remained true to the spirit of the book, scenes were constructed in such a way as to fatally cripple the pace - in other words, due to poor directing, lively scenes were made to drag. This pacing problem continued throughout, moving from congealed treacle slow to so rapid they literally spend nearly two consecutive hours of the movie being chased, mostly by Orcs.

The actual length was three hours fifty minutes. I ended up watching this in three increments, because it was impossible to sit through a movie that was mired in a sea of CGI, and where even many of the action sequences were dull due to the inclusion of too many of such. I honestly think a spectacular movie could have been made if many of the scenes therein were simply abridged. About an hour into the movie was approximately 1/3 into the book, and while I am not making comparisons, per se, it does go to show just how much extraneous material was thrown in.

There was entirely too much effort poured into the CGI - to be honest, I am not a fan of computer imagery unless it serves to enhance the storyline instead of being used to carry it entirely. It was all too obvious that the energy was focused on creating dazzling visuals in lieu of focusing on character depth - except, perhaps, for Thorin - and dialogue that served to move things forward. While much was going on, little was actually happening, if that makes sense. Had I not read the book, if someone were to ask me what the first movie was about, my answer would be hazy. We learn tidbits about Thorin, Gandalf and Bilbo, yet all the other dwarves merely serve as extras and even then, the development of the former three left much to be desired.

Overall, I could not say this was an enjoyable movie. It did have it's good moments. Some excellent ones, even. But for a movie of this length, those were just too sparse. Nor was Martin Freeman's portrayal enough to salvage this train wreck of pacing and tedious overuse of special effects. My main gripe is not even that The Hobbit quite often bore little resemblance to Toliken's work, but that this movie reeked of pure Hollywood. A dumbed down action extravaganza with a ton of style and absolutely no substance. As a fan of BBC's 'Sherlock', I was excited about Cumberbatch's voicing of Smaug, though I am not certain if I have enough of a masochistic streak to sit through a second or third installment of this boring, puerile nonsense.",1364169600,23,3121,4.579606440071556
4638879,3,B0059XTU1S,"As a child, I laid awake reading and re-reading Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' so many times that I snapped the spines on three copies. Many times as well have I perused the pages of 'Unfinished Tales', 'The Similarion', 'Children of Hurin' and, of course, the Holy Trilogy itself. Each installment was more wondrously detailed and epic than the last and I devoured them all happily, but it was 'The Hobbit' that I enjoyed the most and that holds true for me to this day. There's something just ever so charming and lovable about that book that keeps me coming back for more and more.
So, naturally, I was excited for the film adaptation. The films Jackson had made out of the Holy Trilogy were excellent. True, they lacked the mythological, historical and political tapestry that made up the background of the books, but they far out did JRR in terms of pacing, so I've always called that one even-Steven. It just seemed to me that Jackson ""got"" the Trilogy is some unique way, a way that let him capture it's essence even while having to hack it up to make due with the limitations of cinema (I still say I'd have preferred a televised mini-series) and Jackson is an immensely talented filmmaker. One would expect then, that the first of his 'Hobbit' trilogy (and I still can't believe it's being split into three. Two I could see, especially with how long they are, but three? Come on) would be on par with his previous Tolkien works.

Nope.

Oh, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is by no means a poor film. It looks remarkable, sounds even better, the camera work is stunning as is the music. The acting is great (most notably on Gollum), Bilbo and Gandalf are both enchanting all over again and the film has a tremendous sense of setting and place as well as being highly atmospheric. I do like this film, but the issue is all of this unneeded added content. Plot threads have been taken from 'Unfinished Tales' and 'The Similarion' and shoved in for, honestly, no real tenable reason. They drag the pacing out quite a bit at times and they take the focus off the characters, leaving us with Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin and 12 interchangeable bearded gents you will neither remember properly or even care about (even if you did read the book). The start of Bilbos arc through the series can feel a bit condensed as well. The real issue is in how this derails the story telling. Going from the fairly small story of 'The Hobbit', wherein the journey is much bigger than the plot or destination, to apocalyptic portents of Dark Lords rising to plunge the land into darkness and death is just too jarring and too mismatched. It often feels as though Jackson hurriedly stitched two different films together. There was no need to pad this out to a trilogy, nor any need to ""epic up"" 'The Hobbit' and the new elements, while nicely done in their own right, serve little purpose and only drag the whole production down. The same can be said for the battle scenes: very nice (great even) in their own right, but far too big (or just plain unneeded) for such a small-in-scale narrative.

That all being said, I still liked the film a good bit. It's a very fun, exciting film that's not too well put together in some areas. It's like getting one hundred dollars and then getting punched in the gut. The money is great, but getting knocked to the ground was still unpleasant. Overall, as weird as it may be, I enjoyed it. I highly suggest seeing it, just don't expect the same greatness as the last three outings Mr. Jackson gave us.

Oh, and as for the DVD and/or Blu-Ray of the film? Well, I'd just wait until the inevitable six film mega boxset comes out. It's a few years down the road but we all know it's going to happen. Save your pennies and wait everyone.",1364083200,15,3748,4.539940828402367

It was a lot of fun to watch a story I read as a child coming to life on the screen. I especially enjoyed the singing. Tolkien wrote music to go along with the book, but how would we ever have heard it if it were't included in the film? I mention this because I saw a review complaining about this aspect of the film and calling it a musical. I like that there were humorous elements added to the movie. I like it even more that the humor didn't overpower the seriousness of the story.

Least favorite scenes: 1) While the fighting rock giants were cool to watch, the scene felt like it had been slipped in at the last moment for the wow factor. There was no lead-up. The viewer is just suddenly thrown into the action. 2) The big bird thing again. So predictable.

Favorite scenes: The dwarf dinner party. The Gollum encounter.

Yes, it is a tomb... He approaches a coffin and heaves the heavy lid to the floor with a devastating triple-Winter *THUD*. He speaks some enchantments and the coffin's skeletal occupant emerges. A moment later, the figure regenerates some of its old vigor and we see it is JRR Tolkien.

Tolkien: What is the meaning of this?

*Peter bites his lower lip and emits a swinish ""hee""

Peter:  Just wanted to show you a little something...

He produces a tablet PC from his black robe and, after logging in discreetly, presses play on his Amazon Prime copy of The Hobbit (Part bloody One). Tolkien, confused but intrigued, crosses his arms and patiently watches the movie in its entirety. The two men remain still for what seems like 2 hours and 49 minutes until suddenly Tolkien flings himself into a juvenile fit of tears. Peter raises the tablet high into the air and giggles like a maniac.

Peter:  You wanna know why I did this?!?!

Tolkien: I beg of you -- tell me. And I will right whatever wrong I've done to you. (sobbing)

Peter:  I did it because I CAN!! *LAUGHS*

Tolkien: You sick, sick man!

Peter:  Oh, but this is only the beginning... two more feature length segments are
  on their way!! Heck, I might even make the last a one a Two-parter!!!

With glassy eyes, Tolkien peers at the bearded Kiwi.

Peter:  WHOOOO-HA HA HA HA HEE HA HAAAGH!! And there's NOTHING you can do about it!!!!

With the culmination of his life's work being torn to shreds before his resurrected eyes, Tolkien heaves a large breath of air and lunges at a sword resting by his tomb. Peter flies into the air and produces a staff from within his robe. The two men lock eyes.

Tolkien: I will be forced to stop you if you can't stop yourself!!

Peter:  You can't stop me -- I've already gone full George Lucas!! Bwahahahahahaah!!!!

Peter fires an energy blast from his staff, knocking Tolkien's legs from under him. The author falls hard on his hip and howls in pain. Peter worms away into a dark corner.

The tired author regains himself, holds the sword to his tongue and enchants it. He tosses the blade into the air and it zooms like a magnet toward the tomb's iron exit, illuminating its path in the process. Tolkien bolts, but Peter hurtles deadly lighting at his feet. Tolkien skillfully dodges, but the energy bolts ride past him and destroy the cover of another coffin.

The cadaver emerges --- Ermagersh!! -- It's CS Lewis!! Clive takes a razorwire whip from his sarcophagus and slashes it at Peter's staff. The whip catches the chubby kiwi by the ankles and Peter scurries away in fear, abandoning his staff and whelping like a defenseless, computer generated Warg.

Tolkien and Lewis embrace in a manly hug and solemnly swear to put a stop to Peter's Hobbit movie trilogy. They exit the tomb and head off into the night, determined to brave their way to Weta HQ, no matter the cost and no matter what lands they should have to pass through to get there.

Will you tune in for the remainder of this epic tale?? Perhaps you have knowledge of the remainder of this story and would like to continue its telling yourself??...",1364083200,13,3338,4.594594594594595

4638888,3,B0059XTU1S,"Loved the LOTR trilogy but because of high expectations, I was a little disappointed but still enjoyed it. Lot of great scenes and lot a bad scenes. This is the Phantom Menace of LOTR.

Personal Pros:
- Best Blu Ray 3D movie ever made. Even better than Avatar and Titanic.
- Great sound if you have surround sound hooked up.
- Character CGI was great for the most part.
- Some nice actions scenes.
- Loved seeing some familiar faces, places, and items returning.
- Actor Martin Freeman did a fantastic job as Bilbo.

Personal Cons:
- Most of the CGI backround settings around the actors were just horrible looking and fake. Didn't mesh well. Was very spoiled by the many real buildings and backrounds made from the scratch from the original LOTR movies.
- Interaction and scenes from the Trolls was just plain stupid and dumb. Worst thing is that they talked. Was annoying.
- Love Gollum. However, the scene was dragging on way way too long. Ended up being very stupid and boring. I just wanted it to end. Went nowhere.
- Didn't like the Goblin King. Was just plain annoying and stupid. Shouldn't have made him talk in english. Just use to the main baddies from the other LOTR movies were fearful and badass.
- Way too many dwarfs to keep track of. No room for any character development. I don't remember most of their names. If one was missing, I wouldn't miss any.
- Felt like a they made a kid's version of a LOTR movie like the Phantom Menace.
- Don't know what was wrong with the audio on the 3D disc. I got the music, sound, and effects. The audio from all of the talking was muted or cut in and out most of the time. Exchanged it and same result. Tried everything in my PS3 settings. The sound worked fine for my other new released movies I just watched. I had to turn off my receiver and watch the rest of the movie just in stereo sound from my TV. Too bad cause the backround sound is great in Digital Surround Sound.

4638915,3,B0059XTU1S,"Before I hate on this movie, I want to say that I was entertained and enjoyed it.  In that sense, it was a success.

This movie has very little to do with the Tolkien book.  The screenplay makes no pretense at keeping it in line with the book.  It works pretty well, but if you are purist, skip the movie...it will only annoy you.  Whoever wrote the screenplay seems to have been more interested in matching it to the LOR movies than making the story work.

The good stuff:

1.  The acting is good.  Martin Freeman is particularly good as Bilbo.  He begins as a stereotypical polite-little-Arthur-Dent-Brit and transforms gracefully into a bolder, more confident Bilbo.  He brings a wry humor to the part that you will enjoy.  All of the dwarves did a good job, given the script.

2.  Adding Radagast ""the brown"" to the story worked well.  His animals were fun.  His character, costume and acting are all good.  I particularly loved the bird crap running down his head.

3.  The sets are well done and believable, just like the Lord of the Rings. (The CG backgrounds and scenes are NOT well done at all, but the real props and sets are good.)

4.  The makeup and consumes are fun.  Some of the dwarves look very good.  Their movements on screen are  believable.  When they run, they run like dwarves.

The bad stuff:

1.  It's too dark and brooding.  The Hobbit is meant to be light hearted and humorous.  This is not.  They totally fail to capture the tone of the book.  The comedy seems forced and out of place.  In the original book, the dwarves are naive and optimistic and only Gandalf seems to understand how grim and hopeless things really are.  The absurdity of the odds against them and their complete confidence was one of the key features of the book.  I missed the ""holiday outing"" tone of the book.

2.  All the dwarfs are indestructible killing machines?  Really?  All of them?  Even Bombur?  Instead of quaking in their boots and bumbling their way through fights, they attack like commandos and wade through thousands of goblins without a scratch.  Instead of fighting with walking sticks and wearing hoods like the original book, they show up at Bag-end dressed for battle and carrying their own weight in armor and weapons.  All of them are martial arts masters instead of miners and merchants.  This characterization doesn't work with the costumes and attempted humor.  You can't have it both ways.

3.  Thorin is an epic hero.  Instead of a cranky, self important, greedy old guy, this version of Thorin is a sexy, young, good looking version of Aragorn.  The original character is defined by his stubborn, arrogant will and sense of entitlement, and that's often the only thing that keeps them going.  The movie character is nothing like that.  Why not make him a vampire while you are at it?

4.  They desperately needed a combat consultant and maybe even a historian.  The weapon designs, armor designs, tactics and combat movements were horrible.  Whoever choreographed the combat sequences has clearly never seen a real fight.  Maybe this is less noticeable to young viewers who are used to playing video games, but it was annoying and very distracting to me.

The really horrible stuff:  (The worst CG in history?)

This movie is loaded with computer graphics.  That can be an excellent thing, but in this case, it's not.  It's poorly executed and entirely over the top.  I wish the producers of this movie had saved a few bucks and toned it down about 95%.  When the characters overcome four impossible threats a second for 6 minutes straight, it's hard to worry about them much.  You lose all suspense and all sense of reality.  In a sense, the CG destroys the whole movie and turns an otherwise fine production into a joke.

1.  The computer generated sets are unbelievable and unrealistic enough to ruin the tone of the movie.  Hundreds of rickety rope bridges, buildings on top of crazy spires, impossible architecture etc.  Every cliff is an impossible overhang.  The lighting and shading of the underground scenes was horrible and some of the backgrounds seem to have been drawn by school kids.

2.  The physics are terrible and cartoon-like.  Inertia is wrong.  Falling rates are wrong.  Running speeds are wrong.  Birds don't fly like birds.  A warg pushes over a mature tree, which then topples several other trees.  The characters fall hundreds of feet and get buried by landslides and then hop right back up as if they had fallen 2 feet.  They get thrown off cliffs and nobody even gets winded.  They narrowly miss being killed by tons of falling rocks in almost every CG assisted scene.  The running fight in the goblin tunnels was one of the worst CG assisted fight scenes I have ever seen (it was spectacularly bad).  The stone giant scene was insulting.  Wow.

3.  The CG is poorly matched to the real actors.  In several scenes, the angles are wrong and the actors are clearly not oriented to the CG stuff.  In the troll scene, for instance, Bilbo was hiding from them in clear view, yet acted as if he was behind cover.

4.  EVERYTHING was over the top and inconsistent.  Gandalf can set off a Nuke apparently while he is in the goblin caves....but immediately loses that ability and has to resort to throwing pine cones a few scenes later? Why not another nuke?  The spectacular and erratic nature of the CG really detracts from the film and overwhelms the otherwise fine production.

Overall, this is still a watchable and enjoyable movie, but don't expect too much.  Hype and marketing set expectations too high sometimes.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Or maybe just read the book.",1364083200,,5625,4.68448098663926
4638916,4,B0059XTU1S,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Don't be afraid of the running time, it flies right by.
Great music, great sets, great acting and wonderful cinematography.
I have not read The Hobbit, so I cannot say if it follows the story line or not.
My only complaint was some of it was a bit Indiana Jonesish.  A little too coy and snippy in some places.  The movie can stand on its own without ""dumbing it down"" or trying to be cutesy.  I am glad there was not excessive Gollum in this one.  I know the effect is cool but I think there was way too much focus on him in TLOR trilogy when more time could have been spent on the other events.
All in all a great Saturday afternoon movie and I am excited to see the other two installments.",1364083200,,726,4.1571428571428575
4638917,2,B0059XTU1S,"So Peter Jackson is back in the director's chair to put the classic whimsical Tolkien novel The Hobbit on screen.  What you get here is part 1 of a 3 part trilogy of a 290 page book.  Yeah, seriously.  This film is riddled with poor dialogue, violence at every corner, Jackson and company treat the audience like a bunch of morons with their script, unnecessary changes made to the book, and deviates from what is important in the novel, which is Bilbo Baggins' craftiness!  What should have been maybe two shorter films or one long film of whimsical fun has/will be turned into 9 hours of paycheck for Jackson.

Now I don't want to be completely unfair, let's start with the good things in the movie.
THE GOOD---
The dialogue.  But wait, didn't I say the dialogue was bad?  Yes, the dialogue is terrible, but there are moments when the dialogue is brilliant, and the only time those times happen is when they actually USE THE DIALOGUE TOLKIEN WROTE.  The scene where Gandalf meets Bilbo and exchange good mornings, that was perfection and that is what this movie should have been.  Riddles in the Dark is relatively good because they use TOLKIEN'S dialogue.  Tolkien was a master with words and the dialogue is almost 100% written for this book.  Whenever the dialogue from Tolkien's pen is used, it works great.

Bilbo spares Gollum.  The scene where Bilbo spares Gollum's life is a fantastic scene.  It was moving.  It worked.  We finally get to see what should be the main character BILBO be the centerpiece of something moving.

Gandalf and some of the opening.  I actually really enjoyed the opening scene where they show the Kingdom Under the Mountain Erebor.  It was great.  Gandalf was well done as well.

THE BAD----
Most of the opening.  The opening should have been introducing Erebor and cut straight to Bilbo outside of his house being visited by Gandalf.  No, we get an unnecessary cameo from Frodo Baggins and Ian Holm.  Come on.  This is where it starts for the second worse thing in the film and that is....

LOOK, REMEMBER THIS FROM LORD OF THE RINGS???  Ok Peter Jackson, we get it, Frodo was in LOTR.  Yeah we know, look its Elrond, Sarumon, and Galadriel from LOTR.  Holy crap its Rivendell, remember that from Lord of the Rings?  Remember this?  Remember that?  What the heck is Jackson thinking about?  This film should be focused on Bilbo and finding the magic ring, but what we get is a slew of ""Look audience, remember this?!?!?!""  Did the script writers seriously sit there and decide, hey we should show this to remind the audience that it was in Lord of the Rings!  This is garbage writing.  More on the writing soon.

Aragor....I mean Thorin.  Jackson and company have ruined Thorin.  He doesn't even match the description in the book.  Read the book.  Thorin is a glorified dwarf with a long flowing grey beard (which stood for strength) and was tough.  What we get here is Thorin, the douche-bag bro from Jersey Shore.  Thorin is terrible.  Jackson has said frequently that the films he makes should be Tolkien's film.  Hey Peter, read the book kid.  So since we established that Peter and the other script writers either can't read or just used the pages from the Hobbit for toilet paper for the crew....

Violence, some plot, violence, walk, violence.  How is there not a universal consensus that this film is just more typical Jackson violence.  The book's first bit of violence is when Gandalf and Thorin find swords in the Troll's cave and then they are the only two that wield weapons.  The Dwarves didn't even set out from Hobbiton armed.  What we get though are 13 dwarves prepared to cut down anything in their path.  Since we armed the Dwarves, Jackson might as well insert as many battle scenes as possible.  This is insulting to Tolkien who wrote his novels as a sort of ""war is the last option,"" but it makes me battle fatigued.  Its just one thing after another.  Fight fight fight fight.  It isn't even good.  The scene in the Goblin Cave is just ridiculous.  It treats violence like breathing.  Just happens, nothing special here, just move on!  With that said....

Liberty with scenes/inserted scenes.  The scene with the three trolls.  Read the book.  Each Dwarf gets snatched up in secret.  Let's cut into Jackson's script writing session:
Peter Jackson: So in the next chapter of the book, the trolls secretly capture all the dwarves and Bilbo uses cunning to get them out.  Hmmmm....there is no violence or a fight.  Ok, scratch that, Tolkien doesn't know what he is doing, I got this.  They will fight and fight some more.
This is all over.  Jackson inserts so many stupid useless scenes.  Let's just ignore the stupid cameos from Galadriel, Sarumon and Radagast.  More garbage.  This film should be focused on BILBO.  Not all this other useless garbage.

Wrong central theme.  Instead of Bilbo being the main character, we get the story focused on #1, Thorin.  #2, Look here is how this will connect with Lord of the Rings (Radagast, Sarumon, ect.), and then #3.  Jackson finally said, oh yeah, Bilbo is in this story too, better put him in somewhere.  Garbage.

Lastly and my favorite stupid thing from this movie, the dialogue and treating the audience like morons as written by Peter Jackson.  Let's start with the blatant foreshadowing from Peter Jackson.  Early in the film Gandalf clearly tells Bilbo it is important to make a good decision on whether or not to kill someone, to show pity.  Here is exact quote "" True courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.""  GEE, THANKS PETER.  I'm glad you think your audience is far too stupid to realize that something might happen later.  This is all over the film.  Peter Jackson thinks so highly of himself and so little of his audience he resorts to that garbage plot writing and instead of using Tolkien's witty and beautiful dialogue, he replaces it with fight scenes, CGI and very poor written dialogue.

Oh my god, the dialogue.....it is TERRIBLE.  You can tell which pieces of speech are written by Tolkien in the book and which pieces of dialogue are written by our genius writers in Peter Jackson, his wife and Fran Walsh.  If the dialogue sounds like an after-school cartoon special ""When there is sickness, bad things happen,"" (that is actually in the film) you KNOW Jackson was in on it.  Or the last scenes when Thorin talks to Bilbo, just terrible.  I cannot believe how bad the dialogue is.  ""Do you smell it?  The scent of fear.""  Oh god....am I watching Lifetime?

This movie is absolute garbage.  Hollywood, CGI, garbage of a literary masterpiece crafted by a master writer.  There is a reason Christopher Tolkien calls his father's work on the Hobbit being ""eviscerated"" by Peter Jackson.",1364083200,7,6742,4.690068493150685

Peter Jackson could've worked with Martin Freeman a lot harder because he was simply not as convincing as the likes of Ian Holm.

Peter Jackson needs to redeem himself in the second part of this film by getting Martin Freeman to live up to how the character truly be portrayed. In my view he spent way too much time off the set based on the additional blogs he added for this movie.

I rented the movie digitally knowing an Extended Edition will be available sometime around November, and I'm not going to purchase a movie when there's a director's cut coming out soonish.

The movie simply is not up to par with the LOTR collect collection, in my opinion they did made the same misktake as star-wars peisode 1 and tried to force comedy into what would otherwise be a darker movie. The first 30/40 min of the movie are the worst with unnecessary songs and a kitchen scene that is so ridiculous is a shame to even include in the movie.

There are many really good parts in the movie that make it good, it sure is nice to see how it all started but again at timea I feel they go too far with their efforts to keep us entertained and lighten up the story.

Their really aren't any pop out scenes after that,but the movie boast some great 3D depth and amazing effects to boot.

The Hobbit at first moves at a very slow,almost I dare say a carefree pace,and where some have reservation against it,I for one really enjoyed that about this film. It doesn't seem to get to the point until the halfway mark and I applaud it for that.
As where the LOTR trilogy (as amazing as it was), moved the viewer as quickly as possible to tell the whole story The Hobbit more or less sits back,takes a deep breath,and lets you explore a more day to day middle earth for the first half of the film.

It's fair to say The Hobbit hasn't been as enthusiastically received as the past three films and perhaps fairly so.
However, I see this more as a  ""for the fans"" type of film rather than something created for a wider audience.

4638948,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Extended Edition (DVD +UltraViolet) (2013) (I made my purchase at a local target rather than Amazon.

What you need to know -- the digital ""Ultra-violet"" is a very limited choice of options as you MUST have one of the digital provider proprietary systems such as Apple's iTunes and that means you can only access it via ""registered and approved devices"" and are limited to how many can access it -- you can't even buy a second license for it.

It would be better to just buy the DVD set and do the digital yourself.

Now to the Extended Version of the movie --- That is what raised my 3 stars to 5 -- the Extended Version makes the movie actually more enjoyable and much less choppy. Even the humor scenes are a bit more enjoyable.

This is a much better addition to my Lord of the Rings library -- and DVDs will play in all DVD players (region respecting unless you find a region free version out there).

The ""official"" reviews suggest the added content was very limited -- yet in my opinion it actually makes the movie play much better and more consistent story spell hold.

As to the people complaining about the adaptation of the book, remember there will always be differences, among which are the lack of mental insights gained from reading about characters internal responses to the various situations... so far as I know only the original adaptation of DUNE attempted this and even then there was much chopping due to the time limits to a Hollywood production -- so a story such as The Hobbit will be different in a motion picture than the book -- yet this production (with the extended footage) holds true enough that Tolken's vision is not lost in the adaptation.

It is a worthy addition to any video library -- and worth interviewing with reading of the books.

I will now wait for the extended edition of the Hobbit 2 before watching it so I can just enjoy the better movie.
-----------------
Non-extended version review:
Firstly, must point out that I rented this movie via amazon's Instant Video -- my only problem is actually a problem with Cox because if I am connected for more than an hour, they tent to temper my speed so that Amazon's streaming system gets lost or blocked.

Now about the movie. I was disappointed -- I watched it in two parts on my 48 hour rent:

Night 1 I watched to the Rivendale sequence was completed -- (note that there can be no spoiler in this movie as long as you have read the book)  There was a lot of attempt at humor that just did not do near as well as the Quad from the Lord of the Rings hobits did. It actually seemed to bog the movie down a rather large bit making it really hard to stick with it. I hope that the Extended Version that will come out towards Christmas will correct that.

Night 2 -- Much better going from the Rivendale departure to the end -- more of what the Lord of the Rings movies was about. But that is not to say that there weren't a few elements to take away from it -- the goblin king seemed at times to havt the kind of Gungan King appeal from the Star Wars Episode 1 and as much as I liked the original cuts of Star Wars 4 to 6, I did not like the Star Wars Episode I at all -- so something like that just takes away from Jackson's Hobit.

I suspect that this is due to the essential take-over of MGM's corporation oversite by WB -- they tend to be more flashy with fantasy stuff (Remember how the mishandled Harry Potter?)

I hope that the Jackson oversite when putting out the extended versions will prove the same with this movie as it did with the LotR -- believe it or not the Extended Cuts of LotR is so extra-ordinarily better than the theatrical release, so that I why I chose to rent this rather than buy -- and will look forward to the Extended cut release at the end of this year -- economy permitting.",1363996800,,3830,4.34593837535014
4638949,4,B0059XTU1S,"First, let me say that this is critiqued more harshly due to the overall epic expectations set by it's predecessors. You could even argue the bar was set so high that this film was undoubtedly set up to be a partial let down.

Okay, so ""The Hobbit"" is based of a significantly shorter base book source. And, to top it off, is being split into three different films that will all be roughly the same length as a LOTR film. Because of this, the film often seems to drag on unnecessarily. For instance, you'll get about 20 minutes of Dwarf introductions and lots of prolonged conversations that are unwelcome gaps in the overall pacing of the film. The story is still great, and there is a lot to enjoy, but this is not a dense story. You'll be dealing with a little fluff.

The graphics in this film are stunning! The CGI has already improved significantly since the original 3 films, and it shows. The clarity of Gollum on screen and the countless goblins make for some fun and visually appealing eye candy. The 3D for this film is also a high point. I'm rather critical of 3D as often I find it unnecessary and not worth the extra cost, but in this case I'm willing to pay the extra $5 or so because it's clear a lot of work went into making this films 3D part of the complete immersion of the film, rather than a crappy after thought.",1363996800,,1335,4.336

*Quick Note: I haven't read The Hobbit, so I'm not exactly comparing it to the book. I have read summaries of the novel though (yes, I know, I'm a cheater), so I'm going off of th

The Hobbit isn't a bad movie. It honestly isn't. It was definitely one of my favorite movies from 2012. But it just wasn't quite what it could have been. And to answer the question of ""Is The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings better?"" In my opinion, Lord of the Rings is the better movie.

Now, there's a lot of good stuff in this movie, don't get me wrong.

The acting is fantastic. Martin Freeman IS Bilbo. You do not doubt for one second that he is Bilbo. In a lot of ways, I found him to be more likable than Frodo (who I still like as a character, but, well, that's a different story.) Freeman is just endearing as the unassuming hobbit from Bag End. Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis reprise their roles as Gandalf and Gollum, respectively. To no one's surprise, they do great. They are every bit as good as they were in The Lord of the Rings.

The dwarves are the ensemble here, the way the Fellowship was in the first Lord of the Rings movie. We only really get to know Thorin as a character as far as the dwarves go. And I must say, Richard Armitage does an admirable job playing the conflicted Thorin Oakenshield. As for the other dwarves, they all did a nice job in their roles and were entertaining to watch, despite the fact that we only get glimpses of their character here and there. (And not to mention, there are some very attractive dwarves.)

There are also some very well-done scenes in the movie. I enjoyed the scene where the dwarves all crash at Bilbo's house. Personally, I think it conveyed the fun, lighter tone the movie was trying to get across (more on that later.) It's a nice insight into Bilbo's characters and a nice way to meet the dwarves.

The riddles scene with Gollum was great. I loved the humor that was thrown in here and there, but that the scene was also creepy and had some tension. It was interesting to see Gollum in a different light. You almost pitied him when Bilbo took the ring and almost kiled him.

The beginning scene with Bilbo and Frodo was a nice addition. It was short, but it was a nice shout-out to the LotR trilogy. While Frodo seemed incredibly thin and pasty (maybe it was just me), it was sort of...chilling to see him pre-Ring. I know that sounds like a bizarre way to put it, but seeing him before his journey seemed strange and kind of sad. The whole time he was on screen I was just thinking about what was to come for him.

Middle-Earth looks gorgeous. There seems to be more CGI this time, but still, it looks beautiful.

And I can't mention what I liked about the movie without mentioning the music. Howard Shore has done another great job with the score for this film. The movie captures the simplicity of Hobbit life, the tension of thte battle scenes, and everything in between. The Misty Mountains song is lovely. It just sounds like it came straight out of Middle Earth.

Unfortunately, despite the great acting, the music, and some well-done scenes, The Hobbit had its flaws.

There were a lot of little things that botherd me about the movie. I thought the Goblin King was incedibly silly and didn't look menacing at all. He just looked digusting. I was hoping they would go the ""Orc Route"" with the Goblin King and make him look creepy and hellish, not goofy and over-the-top gross. His one line, ""Well, that will do it!""...eh, n'mind. I'm not going to get into that.

Radagast was also unnecessarily silly. While I've never read the books, if I remember correctly, he is supposed to be as powerful as Gandalf (**but I could be wrong about that**). And while he may be a little nutty, this movie just took it too far. His rabbit-pulled sled was ridiculous and the fact that he had bird poop in his hair did him no favors. I mean, really, I'm supposed to think THIS guy is as powerful as Gandalf?

The film's two biggest issues, however, are the pacing and the tone.

I feel like this movie couldn't quite decide what audience it wanted to appease the most. ""The Hobbit"" was written as a children's book, so I wasn't expecting this to have the dark, sometimes grim tone the ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy had. However, with this movie, there were a couple moments that seemed pretty dark. The movie appeared to want to try to sort of ""age"" the story, if you will, to appeal to more of the adult LotR/Hobbit fans. And yet, we have things like wizards with bird poop in their hair and overly grotesque goblin kings and just cheap humor. The movie does have its moments of more mature humor that works, but not many. And this isn't to say it didn't need humor, but it didn't do it well. ""Lord of the Rings"" had much better, subtle humor when it was needed. The film seemed to be trying to strike the balance between being mature enough for adult viewers, while still being good for the kids, and unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark.

Then there's the pacing. As I'm sure everyone knows, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is only part one of what is going to be a three-part series. Unfortunately, the source material is only about 280 pages (at least my copy is.) Needless to say, the pacing of this film suffers. Since there are still have two more three-hour-long movies to fill, the scenes here feel very long. The movie only covers about five or six chapters of the book, I believe. There are several times in this movie where it feels overly looooong. The fight scene with the goblins felt long. The beginning, while I liked it for introducing us to the dwarves, was long. There were just quite a few times where the movie dragged and the tension was pretty much lost.

So, ""The Hobbit"" isn't a terrible film. It's enjoyable. The acting's great, it has some good scenes, and the music is amazing. But it suffers from pacing and tone and it definitely isn't as good as Lord of the Rings.",1363996800,4,5982,4.423636363636364

4638968,3,B0059XTU1S,"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.

The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.

The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.

If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR.",1363996800,3,1282,4.3940677966101696

The hobbit is a decent movie but there were just too many side stories and amplifications which don't fit with the original book. Even though the movie writers added some storyline, I did find it entertaining and enjoyable to watch. It has beautiful visuals and although I missed some of the characters from the LOR's trilogy, it still have enough to keep me entertained. I recommend it as a good movie to watch as long as you as don't think too much about the storyline versus the book and don't compare it to much to the LOR's trilogy.",1363996800,,726,4.425373134328358
4638970,4,B0059XTU1S,"There's been a lot of criticism towards this movie; most of which springing forth from the fact that many feel it shouldn't be split into three films. I'm actually in the group who, before the film, felt like three films was ridiculous. After watch the first in Jackson's trilogy, I will grudgingly say I'm okay with it now.

Here's where I'm coming from. The Hobbit, simply put, could not make three films on its own. Adding the elements from Tolkien's other works though, that makes for a way to increase time and, this is the part where I think many will disagree with me, will help pacing. Yeah, I know, I'll be the first to say that this movie feels too long (not interested in an extended edition this time, thank you. This would be fine by itself.) but the very nature of The Hobbit is a quest novel. There's a lot of traveling from place to place and getting into adventures along the way. The added benefit of the Necromancer plotline in the upcoming films, should actually make the pacing better. We'll have less jumping from moment to moment and more of a focus on two specific goals (Goal 1: the 14 going for the gold/Goal 2: the wizards fighting the necromancer) which can interact with each other. As of my writing this, neither of the later two Hobbit movies are out, so I'm just offering a hopeful note of possible way for the series to go.

Onto the Blu-ray, the picture is wonderful, the special features are lighter than I would like, but more than I expected. Those of you waiting for the extended edition will no doubt see more when it arrives. The 3D is very good. This is the sort of 3D that doesn't pop out at you with gimmicks, but the sort that helps build the world by creating more depth. It's not the most impressive to look at, but it does add another visual layer to the film. (NOTE: the 3D version is split across two discs, so those of you not wanting to get out of your chair for an intermission may want to stick with the 2D.)

All in all, I enjoyed The Hobbit. It has its faults, it's overlong, but it's enjoyable. I'm happy to revisit middle earth, and seeing my favorite of Tolkien's books come to the screen can't help but make me smile.",1363996800,2,2176,4.381188118811881

An Unexpected Journey

I had planned to watch this in the theater, but sometimes life has other plans.  So I was eagerly anticipating this prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I was not disappointed and am looking forward to the second in this trilogy series.

There are scenes that were not in The Hobbit but were found in other of Tolkien's writings.  But to be perfectly honest what movie is exactly like every book upon which it is based.  Some movies are so loosely based on the books that other than the title of the movie and the names of the characters there is no similarity, but that is not the case with The Hobbit.

I like the fact that the movie brings in LOTR's with Bilbo writing about his adventures to Frodo and that it takes place just before the birthday party and Frodo getting the ring.

4638972,5,B0059XTU1S,"Before we get to the review, I have read and reread The Hobbit ...well, probably too many times. J.R.R. Tolkien created a world (well, he actually created a language in need of a world) that has entertained millions. I have have treasured these stories and was a bit hesitant when I heard they were going to be made into a movie because ...well, Hollywood never seems to get it right for whatever the reason (money, ego, quote creative differences unquote, whatever) which is why the book is always better than the movie. However, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed these movies as much as the books.

Peter Jackson and his crew have done it again, this time with The Hobbit. (If you haven't seen Lord of the Rings, I highly recommend you do so.) Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and does his usual phenomenal job - he plays the part extremely well and has this ability to convey paragraphs with his eyes or a simple gesture ...I can't imagine anyone else playing him. Bilbo is played by Martin Freeman who seems to have been born for the part. I won't go into too many details about the other characters, but I will mention Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Ken Stott (Balin) who gave wonderful performances. I had no trouble believing that Thorin and his people were robbed by a dragon.

This is the first of three movies for The Hobbit - they've extended the story from the appendices of The Return of the King. From Bag End to Rivendale to ...well, I don't want to have to type 'spoiler alert' at the beginning. Needless to say, The Hobbit takes us to Middle Earth and Peter Jackson makes you believe it really exists. (These movies have also added added the entire country of New Zealand to my bucket list.) The bonus features are interesting and gives us a tyro's understanding of how a movie such as this is made ...the logistics alone are mind-boggling. Make it a point to watch the bonus features at least once.

4638976,2,B0059XTU1S,"This is barely The Hobbit. It's essentially The Lord of the Rings: The Prequel. Director Jackson's instincts, comparatively on the mark in the LotR trilogy (particularly in The Fellowship of the Ring), seem to have deserted him here.

While in some respects the prototype for the later Lord, The Hobbit was a far more intimate, careful creation -- an epic but also a novel -- and the movie deserved its own distinctive vibe, its own pacing, its own production design.

But it's been treated as a second-rate Lord of the Rings mash-up. Jackson has simply pushed The Hobbit down into the LotR mold, trimmed off the parts that over-ran the borders and added new LotR-style material where Tolkien did not supply it. (Hence, the Giant Combat Scenes and the Powerful Nemesis and the omission of any useful sense of the delights of Bag End.)

Indeed, there's so much extraneous material that the story (originally as straightforward as can be) occasionally gets a bit lost. For instance, in the central section a fair chunk of time is invested in the wizard Radagast, but to no useful purpose beyond seeming inspiration for a ""Return of the Jedi"" speeder bike-type sequence in the inevitable video games.

And Radagast has company. Jackson has needlessly freighted his movie with characters who never appeared in The Hobbit and one of the results is that, with less screen time (and few closeups), the core cast is harder to identify. If you're making a story with 13 dwarves, this is something at which you need to work assiduously. They should not be largely interchangeable -- and they are. (At the same time, a number of the dwarves barely seem like dwarves at all. Thorin Oakenshield in particular has been 'Aragorned' and wears a single disdainful look on his face throughout.)

The director also hasn't edited himself tightly -- this theatrical edition runs an exhausting two hours and forty minutes -- and this is his first Tolkien movie to try my patience at a basic level.

And even in the most basic terms, Jackson hasn't even made what I'd call a technically good movie. There's something distinctly and consistently ""off"" here. Too much of this feels as though it wasn't fully thought through -- as though Jackson didn't have time or inspiration or handed off critical issues of continuity and style to ADs or production assistants. But The Hobbit has none of the organic flow of the the LotR films, it's notably lacking in the artful audio-visual signposts that helped guide us through the trilogy and certain scenes are just botched. For instance, the one in which young Bilbo passes out under the pressure of too many uninvited guests is downright incompetent -- not well-acted or sweetly sad and certainly not funny. It plays as though Freeman either missed his cue or Jackson simply didn't have time to labor over the result. Similarly, Gandalf's appearance outside the hobbit hole's door and the trolls sequence, both so memorable in print, come across oddly half-baked in the reinvented versions here.

And it's all just so uneventful! Even the climax seems trivial and underdone (and oddly overdone at the same time) and at one point I found myself almost laughing. I could point to the miscasting of Freeman in the title role -- even Elijah had greater gravity -- or the absence of the rich sense of foreboding that was so much a part of the novel or the issues some allege with the high frame rate, but I suspect it's a deeper issue: the pressure to turn this unitary tale into a trilogy and the resultant overtaxing of the source material. (A far more sensible scheme was laid out by the director back in the '90s, when he saw The Hobbit by itself as the first film in a trilogy with LotR filling in the last two slots.)

As many people have pointed out, this movie is not Tolkien's novel verbatim.  It's significantly altered.  The novel is a great adventure story, I read it about a decade ago.  However, it's not epic.  Lord of the Rings is Tolkien's epic story.  I guess, because Peter Jackson already did the epic trilogy, he wanted to make Tolkien's first novel novel into an epic trilogy as well.  So, there is a LOT of added content.  Unlike some people who have read the novel, I like the film.  It's different but good.  I saw it in a packed theater on Christmas and had to get the Blu-ray the day it was released. So, I bought it in a store instead of waiting for it to be shipped.  The Blu-ray is a great product, the picture is beautiful and the sound is great. The special features are nothing special, the production blogs put me to sleep.  Fortunately, I bought it for the film and not that stuff.  Ultraviolet is useless to me, so no comment on that.  Also, I didn't need the DVD but couldn't get the Blu-ray without it, so I gave it to my Dad.  Now he doesn't have to buy the movie (nice going, WB.)",1363910400,2,1345,4.402439024390244
4639002,4,B0059XTU1S,"Martin Freeman (""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"") stars as Bilbo Baggins. He's a reluctant hero with a good heart and extremely likeable. Sir Ian McKellen returns to his role as Gandalf the Grey - a younger Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Returning roles also include: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel; Ian Holm as Old Bilbo; Christopher Lee as Saruman; Hugo Weaving as Elrond; Elijah Wood as Frodo; and Andy Serkis as Gollum. It's a bit odd going back and doing a prequel story, making characters younger. But with the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's not surprising that The Hobbit was picked up as well.

Nine years after the release of the Return of the King also means that the CGI and cinematography is even that much more fantastic. The rich landscapes are breathtaking. And the creature effects are incredibly impressive and life-like. In fact, my only complaint is that the novel The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien has been split into three movies. It felt like parts of this installment could have been skipped in order to fit everything in - and just made into a slightly longer film. But I'm sure the movie makers want the extra money that 3 films can bring instead of 1 or even 2.

This first installment in the Hobbit trilogy is a fun, thrilling, adventure. Full of humor, suspense, drama, and magic - fantasy fans will certainly enjoy. Since this is the first in the trilogy of films (and it's based on only one novel) the film ends in an abrupt, awkward place.  And the wait for the next installments seem painfully long.",1363910400,,1555,4.6268115942028984

4639021,3,B0059XTU1S,"Warning, spoilers ahead. Well, can they really be called spoilers? You've already seen everything in this movie. It was called Lord of the Rings. The biggest flaw with this film is that it is 3 hours long, and split into 3 separate films. 9 hours. There simply isn't enough material to work with here. I can sum up this film very simply: Dwarves run towards Lonely Mountain being chased by orcs. That's all that happens in this movie.

Fortunately, you can skip it, because you've already seen everything in LOTR. I'm sure someone creative could easily cut and paste clips from the 3 major films and recreate the first Hobbit. Frodo and Bilbo sit around talking about adventures and parties. Gandalf comes in and convinces him to go on an adventure. Someone is attacked at the old hill castle by a ghost king. Gandalf leads them through caves chased by orcs. The orcs hunt them in open fields on giant dogs. The orcs are led by, you guessed it, a taller slimmer orc. The trolls even have a short cameo. Gollum splashes around in a cave carrying on about his ring. The giant eagles rescue the Fellowship and fly them towards the mountain (why don't they just fly them the whole way??). They walk along a thin path on the side of the mountain and what happens? Yep, the mountain begins to fall. It just keeps going.

Literally everything in this movie, I had seen before. All the original, new stuff that I may have been interested in actually seeing is apparently saved for a later movie. Plus, the CGI is far too obvious.

So in conclusion, skip this film. It's tediously boring.",1363910400,2,1579,4.572438162544169

There were moments of brilliance-the rescue scene, Smeagol and Bilbo's riddle game immediately come to mind.

The book is about a third the length of Tolkein's LOTR masterpiece...and in my opinion there is just not enough material for three movies of the length of this one. But having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film; and it is only in comparison to the original trilogy that it doesn't measure up. Ian McKellan is again Gandolph and delivers another masterful performance; and Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo Baggins also performs masterfully. The Dwarves are new characters with new actors portraying them; but in addition to McKellan, you will see many familiar faces...Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis.

4639041,5,B0059XTU1S,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a superb addition to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jackson has effortlessly blended elements from the LOTR trilogy into The Hobbit, while still injecting it with its own unique town and pacing. Pacing. This is the part that most people get hung up on. I have to be honest and say I LOVE the more relaxed pace of this film. It reminds me of the true epics that were made so long ago, like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur, or The Ten Commandments. The Hobbit: And Unexpected Journey makes you feel as if you are on the long journey with Bilbo and the dwarves. One of the greatest elements of the slower pacing is how much more of Middle Earth we get to see.

In some ways, The Hobbit is even more of a true epic than the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. More than just a ""good vs evil"" story, The Hobbit tells a very large tale represented by only a few key characters. The attention to the political landscape, and the fall of an entire race, brilliantly represented by Thorin Oakenshield, from glory to obscurity, make the stakes in this film incredibly high.

As far as the blu ray goes, the transfer is impeccable. The detail is excellent, and colors are deep and rich. I haven't watched the bonus features yet, but I can't wait to dive in!",1363824000,2,1286,4.421940928270042

4639043,3,B0059XTU1S,"Upfront: it's missing the sweet, innocent, magical and heartwarming charm of ""The Fellowship."" I saw all those familiar places and familiar faces: Gandalf, Bag End, The Shire, Elrond, Rivendell. I missed Strider and the original hobbits. I missed the danger they were running from, the reason for their journey. The tone of this film is different, which is perfectly fine, I just wasn't really expecting that difference. It was harder to reconcile in this film. In the 2nd and 3rd films, when we get away from all the old and familiar and into the new and different they were much easier to get into and enjoy on their own.

Everyone complains that it's long, but I don't have a problem with length if it fleshes out the story. OTOH, contriving shots to stuff into already over-extended battle/fight scenes definitely adds to the weight and sluggish speed of the film with adding anything crucial to the story. They were glaringly obvious, jarring and they took me out of the story every time, which is why this is 3 stars instead of 4 OTOH, I think every second of exposition and character development was necessary. There were so many dwarves and so much background information and I think both were delivered pretty well.",1363824000,,1224,4.800947867298579

Already saw it in 3D, so wanted to watch it in the Normal BDVD format (2D).

Well, anything that was made to really shine in 3D (building/waterfalls of Rivendell, Character Closeups during action scenes) all look like total crap in 2D. (Yes I double checked it was the normal 2D Blu-ray disc [the 3D one actually says 3-D on it and there are 2 of the 3-D discs.])

Imagine image 'screen-effect' now remove the horizontal lines and only have the veritcal line 'screening'. This is what everything that is supposed to be in 3D in that version looks like in 2D. Heavily pixelated veritcally.

Imagine this  character | in 3D it would have this look ||| to give dimension. well the 2D looks like this || and you can visually see what is/was supposed to be '3D looking' in that 3D version.

4639050,5,B0059XTU1S,"Some people wanted The Hobbit to be just one movie. What they may not understand is all of the stuff that has been added from other works. It's not like Harry Potter (a good series) where everything happened at Hogwarts. But what happened in the rest of the world? Secondly, when Tolkien wrote the Hobbit, that was all he had written. The Appendices and other works (some have been added in this movie, like the White Council, and Radagast The Brown) and Lord of the Rings came later. In my opinion, you could not have asked for a better interpretation. This movie made me feel the same as when I saw Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the first time! I couldn't believe the movie was already over, and I was excited to see what would happen in the next! The only people who have told me it was a bad movie, were already thinking negatively about the movie and where they are going with it. I'd say, if you are optimistic about it, then you may actually enjoy the movie. For me, I think Peter Jackson and crew know what they are doing. Like I said before, I can't wait to see the next installment!

Edit: Something I may have left misunderstood was the part about Harry Potter. That is one of my favorite film franchises, and all I meant by it was that J.K. Rowling is still at the beginning of her writing career. If she wanted to, she could create a world of Harry Potter. One other thing that I meant on that comment was more of the fact that you don't see hardly any students or people from the other schools. It seems they are all, or mostly all, from Hogwarts.

4639054,4,B0059XTU1S,"I have mostly enjoyed this film, but there are certain areas that I feel were missed opportunities and a tad disappointing.

There was no question I was going to purchase this film, after the impressive LOTR trilogy, and knowing there are masterful people who worked on (and are still working on) what will be the Hobbit Trilogy. I'm not going to give any spoilers or specific examples* of where I felt it fell short, but I mourn for some of the charm of the book which just didn't come across in the film. I'm not a purist - I realize changes have to be made to tell a story - that's not what I have a problem with. As long as the changes are sensible and add something to the story, as long as key features of the original work are not lost in the transition, then I would have no complaints.

Having said that, The Hobbit is still a fun ride. I will re-watch the film many times, I'm sure, and would be interested in a version with extended scenes. I still love the world-building of Middle Earth, and, having read the book, my mind is sort of filling the gaps the movie missed, and sort of editing out what I don't agree with. I'll purchase the 2nd and 3rd parts of this trilogy, I'm sure, and who knows - maybe they'll be better than this first part.

*(ok - one small, semi-specific complaint which really irks me: how did they manage to not suffer tremendous injuries after all they went through? if you've seen the film, you'll know what i'm talking about. just pushed the limits of credibility a bit too far for me. with the wonders of CGI, it seems too often the temptation is to put in sequences that would be impossible to survive without getting hurt.)",1363824000,2,1665,4.347266881028939

However, with a few exceptions, I thought the movie was well-done, especially the special effects. The movie is not completely true to the book, but it does remain fairly true to the plot and characters. The cinematography is really quite good, and the sets and costumes are remarkably close to what I imagine when I read the book. The acting is also very good, especially Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman. Andy Serkis as Gollum is just extraordinary - watch the video blogs at the end of the film for glimpses of Andy during filming. I am in awe of how in character he is. My main gripe with this movie (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that the producers split the book into three movies, and the first one is quite long considering that there are two more to follow. You would think given the total number of hours of filming will be done by the end, that the script would have followed the book word-for-word. All the books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy became single movies, so the only reason for three movies from this one book is blatant commercialism. Sadly, I am sure I will succumb and see all three movies, thus validating the producers' decision.",1363824000,,1259,4.384615384615385

Don't mind the bad reviews. People went in expecting another Lord of the Rings and were disappointed when it wasn't as amazing as the LOTR were. But the thing is, The Hobbit is a much more lighthearted adventure tale geared toward children. It's supposed to feel a little different from LOTR.

There is so much to love about this movie. The acting is amazing, as is the score and the action scenes(for the most part) are really well done. And it's very funny. There are a few things I didn't really like. I think there is a bit to much goofy humor in some scenes.

4639061,5,B0059XTU1S,"I used to read the entire series every year. I had some concerns with this, especially since they were going to force pushing this book out to 3 movies. This was a concern because the Lord of the Rings books were each progressively more complicated than the previous ones, and this book was very simple by comparison. Honestly as far as the books go, The Hobbit was really written more in the style and complexity of current ""teenager"" books. Not that this is a bad thing, it made the book very easy to read and still enjoyable. But to make a single movie of the more complicated books and 3 out of the lightest version of Tolkien's masterpieces seemed forced.

I saw it on opening day in the theater and I was overjoyed. They added a separate story line (Two actually, and I won't go into details so no spoilers here) that is interesting and exciting to watch. These added story lines were not in the books at all - and as a LOTR purist I am surprised at how happy I was with them. It still very much has the feel of a Tolkien story and didn't take away from the rest of the story - in fact they managed to enhance parts of it with background and other information.

As far as the quality of the actual physical product it is excellent there as well. I was very happy to see that there were subtitles - the original posting here did not include information about included subtitles. The sharpness of the Blu Ray came across very well, crystal clear production and transition to disk. The edition I purchased has 3D, BluRay and DVD formats together.

For most of the other concerns of many people's reviews, they just don't bother me nearly as much. Especially with regards to an extended version likely to come out late in the year. I simply did not want to wait, and I'm glad that I didn't. I may still get the extended versions when they come out too, but that will be a game time decision. I may also just wait for the price to come down then, who knows. Right now I'm not worried about it at all - I got to watch this movie on my TV in my home the day it came out because I had it delivered that way - and if you were to tell me then that I should have waited I would have laughed at the idea of it.

If you are a fan of the series and really want to own and watch this movie, get it now instead of waiting. If you're an ultra purist, or really feel that you're being ripped off because another edition will eventually come out - then of course it's your choice to wait - but also think about the fact that every big production movie always comes out with other editions eventually. It's the nature of the business.

4639062,4,B0059XTU1S,"I think the LOTR movies - especially the extended versions - are very good, though disappointing in many small ways due to many unneccesary changes that were made to the story, characters, motivations, etc.  The Hobbit movie is very similar.  The included additions are silly and add nothing to the story.  Peter Jackson and his writing team need to understand that they're not ""improving"" The Hobbit, they're just adding filler.  Also, see my additional comments below re: the ""Extended"" version.

I can see splitting this into three movies, but why add the filler when there's so much worthwhile material to use?  This isn't about being a ""purist"", it's about telling the story that the studio supposedly found so compelling that they had to tell it.  I know it's an empty complaint, because that's how Hollywood works, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.

This is a good movie, it's worth seeing, but it's also a bit silly how the story has been changed

******************************************************************
Edit 11/12/13:  Amazon won't allow me to review the Extended Edition separately, so here're my 2 cents:

If you enjoyed the extended LOTR movies you'll likely enjoy this.  Is it ""better""?  I don't know that there's more detail to flesh out like in the LOTR saga, but I was still hoping that this would feel a bit closer to the book.  It doesn't, really.  It feels a bit like a cash-grab, but it's still fun to see.  But I've finally put my finger on one of my issues with the Peter Jackson movies:  he doesn't know what tone to take regarding the dwarves.  They're short, see?  So they must be comic relief, right?  Er...um...well, no.  So there are these odd tonal shifts - they're solemn warriors trying to regain their lost kingdom (and fortune), there are these moments of earnest, grave hand-wringing of the their past and the plight of their people.  Then they're all comical buffoons played almost as broadly as the 3 Stooges.  That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not too much of one.  So, essentially, Peter Jackson is incapable of having these dwarves on screen and ""playing it straight"", so to speak.  A bit of whimsey is fine, but it feels like this underlying disrespect for the characters is built into the script.

I don't know, it's a semi-fun adventure film, but to me the tone is just off.  Plus the ""Elves vs. Dwarves"" stuff is played up way too much.

I'd say this movie is still worth watching, but I'm not really expecting much from the overall 3 movie cycle.",1363824000,,2515,4.786046511627907

4639077,5,B0059XTU1S,"After seeing the Lord of The Rings Trilogy in all its glory, I was not expecting any less from Peter Jackson for the Hobbit.  I was a bit aprehensive about how it would come across in 3-D (some 3-D movies are great, but some really fall short of being successful).  This movie was phemomenal! It is the best 3-D movie I have ever seen, and the action is non-stop from beginning to end. Special effects have gone far beyond LOTR in this film and I am really anticipating what they do to Smaug. It has to be the most fantastic dragon ever created.

I first read the Hobbit and  the Lord of The Rings trilogy back in the sixties, and still own the original paperbacks, as well as some very nice hardbound collector sets. I never expect any movie to be just like the book. It would be impossible. As a serious LOTR fan, I was very pleased with the LOTR trilogy on film, and I am equally happy with the way the first segment of the Hobbit was translated to the screen. It is just so exciting seeing so many of the characters I read about come to life. And the best part of owning a movie like this is being able to watch it as frequently as I wish.

I have been waiting patiently for the release of this movie in Blu Ray 3-D.  I have invested a great deal in a big screen 3-D TV and home theater system and even though there aren't many truely great 3-D movies available yet; this one has moved to the top of the list! It is an outstanding film and I can hardly wait for the extended version to be released. I don't mind investing in both the theatrical version and the extended version. I am a LOTR collector and have every version of the trilogy that was made. I will most likely do the same with the Hobbit trilogy.",1363737600,4,1713,4.175757575757576

My negative review has nothing to do with the movie itself or any bad experience on Amazon's part (I purchased mine from Target). My issue is with my inability to watch this film on my computer which was apparently by design.
I purchased the film yesterday and today attempted to watch it on my computer which has blu-ray drive and I've played blu-ray discs on it before. However I got a ""cannot play because disc is copyrighted"" error. double checked to make sure my drive and disc were both clean, they were and still got the error. I tried both the 3d and 2d blu-ray versions and couldn't get them to play. They played just fine on my TV blu-ray player, and to make sure my computer wasn't busted I threw in some other blu-ray films to work and they played just fine.

So I figured I was screwed on the DVD's for my computer but I could at least get the digital download. However, I would have to create 2 accounts just to watch something that I have to access trough a cloud server every time. Whatever happen to the early process where I could jut download the digital copy to my harddrive and enjoy it without the hassle of having to log into a service every time to use it? I already paid for it stop adding steps for me to go through to simply watch a film.

I took it back to store and also asked around, and I was told that this is all done to ensure that the product isn't pirated.

You know, I'm really happy that I decided not to read any reviews or ask anyone of their opinion of the movie before getting the movie. After watching the movie and, now, reading those said reviews and hearing opinions; there's quite abit of hate out there(especially with alot of the professional critics online). I've been hoping & waiting on this movie since the LoTR trilogy started way back in 2001. I realize The Hobbit has had a long and arduous journey making it to the big screen but I'm happy with the outcome, honestly. When I first heard that Peter Jackson was making The Hobbit into three films, I-too- was one of those that thought Warner Brothers was milking it for all it was worth. Yet, after viewing this first film, I can figure out why. I think I'm going to like where Peter Jackson goes with this.

Unlike everyone else, the CGI didn't bother me so much. True, the Uruk-hai seemed more formidable and scary in the LoTR movies because they were real actors in makeup and whatnot. However, the orcs and goblins as well as the battles didn't look, at all, phony to me.

While The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey may not quite reach the greatness or allure of the movies from the LoTR trilogy; it is definitely a 'journey' worth taking..nonetheless.

4639103,2,B0059XTU1S,"Let me state upfront that I read The Hobbit as well as Lord of the Rings (LOTR) when I was young and multiple times after my initial reading. I also just reread The Hobbit a few months ago while waiting for the DVD to come out. I own the extended versions of all three LOTR movies, saw all three movies in the theater (more than once on Fellowship of the Ring) and watch the DVDs fairly regularly. As a fantasy/sci-fi dork with children who love the same genre I should have been the perfect consumer of The Hobbit. I was leery about the movie based on the reviews and the lead up to the film so I actually decided to wait until the DVD came out. It came out yesterday (quite quickly I thought from a release date in mid-December) and our copy came from Amazon on the release date so after dinner we sat down as a family to watch.

Very disappointed. Like couldn't wait for it to get over disappointed.

I found The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey movie to be almost 3 hours of frustration. My kids mostly seemed to find it boring. Maybe I shouldn't have reread the book last month because the movie was only loosely based on it and every time the movie went astray it distracted me. I guess the comparisons were inevitable but they are valid and comparing the two trilogies is like comparing a high school play with a Broadway production.

The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a bold, risky production that was shot all at once before anyone knew if they would have commercial success and the result was one of the best adaptations of a beloved book that you will ever find. I left the theater after The Fellowship of the Ring bummed that I had to wait a year for The Two Towers. I couldn't wait for the movies to come out each December and bought the DVD sets as soon as I could. I can say that I have not only watched the movies over and over, I have also watched most if not all of the hours of special features.

The Hobbit has the feel of cheap exploitation; hey we made a ton of money on the LOTR movies so let's see if we can do the same thing with The Hobbit. I was quite concerned this would be the case after all the pre-production squabbling and then when it was announced that one book, The Hobbit, would be divided up into three movies while the much larger and more detailed LOTR trilogy was also done in three movies, I was definitely not excited. In many ways The Hobbit was just like so many other attempts to make a cheap buck by exploiting a beloved book. I enjoy the old cartoon version of The Hobbit more than what I watched last night.

There are so many places where the scenes just dragged on and either were clumsy attempts at linking the Hobbit to LOTR or ridiculous action sequences to spice up events from the book:

The backstory of the fall of the Lonely Mountain. The interminably long intro with Elijah Wood as Frodo. Every single scene involving Radagast was horrible, Radagast being turned into a failed attempt at comedy relief. The inexplicable gathering with Saruman and Galadriel in Rivendell. The random ""pale orc"" that was supposed to be Azog the Defiler was some of the worst CGI I have seen in a long time. The Great Goblin who looked like something from a kids cartoon rather than a fearsome beast. The escape scene from the clutches of the goblins that went on about ten times longer than necessary and included some just silly, over the top action scenes that were mediocre rehashes of the escape from Moria in the Fellowship of the Ring. The treeing of the dwarves by the goblins that devolved into a cheesy showdown between Thorin and the pale orc. Etc. Etc.

The whole thing was almost palpably painful. The few redeeming parts, like the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum, we not nearly enough to make up for the clumsy, drawn out, ""cheap thrill"" nature of the rest of the movie. The dwarves looked ridiculous, the wargs were a downgrade from LOTR. I would prefer they start all over with a new film and cast new actors (other than Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo who was decent), better to wait five years for a decent film than to roll out parts 2 and 3 from a movie that was already too long in the first installment.

The next two films are still pending. I am hoping that the production team can fix whatever fiasco happened with the interminably long first movie. Perhaps Smaug will be impressive enough to make up for. Maybe the final battle will be more than CGI silliness. We will see. I know this for certain, unless the reviews are over the top positive for The Hobbit, Part Deux, we will again wait for the DVD and this time we will rent it from Redbox rather than buying it.",1363737600,5,4657,4.381944444444445
4639104,1,B0059XTU1S,"As an aficionado of the book, (I have read it 7 times over the years) I feel the book is lost in this jumble of ""hollywood fill"".  The original story line is not accurately followed and plenty of hollywood fantasy ""fill"" is added to stretch the movie to its current length.  As a result it has become a ""kiddie movie"" instead of the much darker but child friendly book.  As you watch the scene with the 3 trolls ask youself ""doesn't this remind me of the Three Stooges""? One troll even sounds like Curly Joe.  As a result, instead of the menacing trolls of the book you get a comedy routine. And by the way, the dwarves ""never fought the trolls in the book, they were captured and bagged by them."" The mountain goblin encounter is completely animated adding to the cartoon feel of the whole film.

""Radagast the Brown"" is not even a part of the original book and is just another corny attempt at comedy that has been added to stretch the movie to feature length, and indeed, the original story into 3 movies when it could have easily been done in one, three hour film.  Regarding any ""extended version"" I will pass, as it is bound to offer more hollywood nonsense. Its a real shame that Peter Jackson sold out for the money that 3 below average films would generate verses just one great film. So if you don't read books and only watch movies then this film is for you. If you do read and have read the book then this movie will be a disappoinment, since good old Pete has trashed the original book.  At least Jackson did a great job on the Lord of the Rings.",1363737600,2,1559,4.318493150684931

Middle Earth is not as dark as in the previous ring movies since ""The Hobbit"" takes place before the others and the main enemy is a fire breathing dragon named Smaug.  There are Orcs and Trolls, but they are not as numerous and mostly stay hidden in the mountains.  Any fans of the ring movies will want to add this to their library as well.

4639110,5,B0059XTU1S,"Since it was announced that The Hobbit would be made into a trilogy of films, the negative criticisms and excoriation have hardly ceased. I will not address that whole aspect of the chatter about this film because I believe it is both incorrect and inappropriate. Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings sought to take a humongous novel and reduce it to three three-hour films (+/-). To the extent that Jackson's accomplishment, visually, is stunning and an unrivaled technical marvel is, by now, beyond question. However, given that Tolkein's accomplishment is primarily linguistic in nature, Jackson and his writers chose to chop most of that language out of the book, and substitute a grand sequence of visual set pieces. For all my admiration of the visual accomplishment, it has always bothered me significantly that in replacing Tolkein's language with an endless series of dialogue fragments that the whole point of the work was essentially lost - or disfigured beyond recognition. One marvels at the technical accomplishment - but at the same time, becomes weary and shell shocked at the unending, relentless battles, blood-and-guts gore almost exactly as Howard Shore's wall-to-wall score creates unforgivable aural fatigue.

I say all this to point now to Jackson's rendition of The Hobbit. Here, Tolkein's exquisite detail has been given the time to be presented much more completely - and when, for example, one comes to the riddle scene, it is very rewarding to see it presented in full sentences, and without simplistic textual redactions. Howard Shore's score is, regrettably, still wall-to-wall - and very annoying at that, and for the same reasons as above.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, as a film, seems to me just about right in all its aspects - especially when compared to the reductio-ad-absurdam of Jackson's LOTR trilogy, even its its ""extended"" versions. The argument that the original novel was a slim, short work, and that Jackson's adaptation is far too dark is absurd on its face. There is plenty of humor here - but the truth is that many of the episodes in the book which Tolkein describes only in general terms (and which would be fleshed out later in LOTR) are given the full, forward looking treatment - and deservedly so. By incorporating other, directly relevant materials from the rest of the LOTR cycle, Jackson has taken Tolkein's ""sketch"" and fleshed it out. It is altogether a satisfying rendition of the novel - whose 163 minutes fly by rather quickly.

4639116,3,B0059XTU1S,"Wow.  And I don't mean to bore you with details, so I won't.  But there's a lot of ground to cover.

First, some context.  Believe it or not, I never read or was read ""The Hobbit"", though I own it on audiobook (but I keep falling asleep while it's playing).  I also never bothered to watch any of the ""Star Wars"" movies (no, none of them).  Therefore, I have no comparison point to the book or Jar Jar Binks which everyone else seems to want to throw this under.  I did watch the extended editions of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and I will do some comparatives there.

For those that don't know the book, this has actually little to do with the book itself.  In fact, while it shares the name and the basic premise, there is a lot of fluff thrown in for 'good' measure.  It is important that you approach this movie the way I did: It is essentially a prologue to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a device to help explain what happened before the ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  While the book is supposed to be the same, there were a lot of missing elements in the story due to J.R. Tolkien not living long enough to get everything tied up.  His son tried, but this movie is really the first time we see the puzzle pieces fitting together.  The end result is rather confusing, so try best to follow along.

The movie begins with a voiceover from Bilbo Baggins, who is writing what will eventually be ""There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale"", seen at the end of the ""Return of the King"".  What he is speaking is found in the letter that he has left for Frodo at the end of his adventure.  It then goes to the now infamous starting line from the book: ""In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit..."" and the whole first few sentences.  It then goes to a brief conversation between Bilbo and Frodo (yes, Elijah Wood).  This culminates into a first meeting with Gandalf, and the dwarves who are embarking on an adventure.

I had a number of problems with how this started.  It felt like Jackson was trying desperately to match what was said in the book - down to the corny diatribe from Gandalf to Bilbo - even though none of it matched the character.  Yet, the full duration of the movie is full with blatant attempts to be a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"".  As such one would expect somewhat clear personality similarities, especially with Gandalf, that simply aren't there in the first parts of the movie.  Secondly, while I wasn't as upset with the dwarf-at-hobbit-hole scene as other reviewers, I had tons of questions.  Why are they not questioning their being sent there?  Why are they simply trusting of Gandalf that this hobbit is the right person?  And why was Bilbo so eager to join the squad?  Again, from what little I recall from the story, Bilbo is constantly reluctant to go on the adventure the entire time.  Yet in the movie this is brushed off as just a brief hesitation.

Once the real adventure begins, the movie starts a sharp divergence from the story.  It still keeps certain elements but there are many others that were simply patched in from other Tolkien stories such as ""The Silmarillion"" and ""Unfinished Tales"".  For example, there isn't a serious session with Saruman and Galadriel with Agent Lord Elrond, with Saruman chewing Gandalf out for making the party (BTW, when Elrond said ""purpose"", he WAS Agent Smith.  Poor Hugo).  There's no epic battle with Albino orcs.  The list goes on and on, and clearly the intent is to maintain the same level of majesty found in the trilogy, so it's understandable why fans of the book might be miffed at some of what's thrown in, nevermind exposing certain characters that were never in ""The Hobbit"" to begin with (aka Frodo and others).

The remainder of the movie is wrought with the same amount of orchestral marching scenes panning gorgeous landscapes in New Zealand as are found in the trilogy.  Thinking of this movie in a different angle, you might not expect this since the book itself is quite short and not the epic adventure that the movie portrays it to be; this is precisely why I say that you must set aside that expectation before approaching the movie.  Seen as simply a prequel to the trilogy, everything makes perfect sense and obviously that's how Jackson saw the endeavor.  He wasn't trying to turn the book literally into the movie (though the first 30 minutes would convince you otherwise).

Much has been made of Radagast the Brown.  Turned from a couple of colorful sentences in the book to a larger-than-life character, Radagast's parts could easily have been excluded entirely.  He adds nothing to the story except finding a certain sword that is shown to Saruman (and thus dismissed as unverified).  I didn't have as much issue with how the character was presented with bird droppings in his beard and down the side of his face; indeed, most book-to-movie attempts result in the exact same (see ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Disney as a perfect example).  As with the aforementioned, if the target is to appeal to the children that read the book rather than the child that is now an adult watching the movie, sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.

Regarding the Blu-ray...my TV, an Insignia that I got about 3 years ago at a really good deal, has the ability to closely emulate the 48fps that the movie was presented at in theaters; just not in 3D (I hate 3D).  So I was able to experience the ""speed"" of things that people were talking about.  The best way I can describe it would be like a play, or a live action event where you are watching things right there on set while they're filming it. It didn't bug me too much since Back to the Future Blu-ray did the same thing at times, but where it got weird is any scene that was filmed with obvious fake props.  The most notable I saw was a scene where they panned over a landscape that was obviously not real; fake trees stuck into fake grass rather than a real area.  Also, when Gandalf is talking to Galadriel, the pillars to her left and right were too fake looking.  Gandalf himself, it was just seeing Ian McKellen in makeup all the time, unlike the trilogy where he blended into the character so well.  Overall, the quality was so clear and clean that you were easily able to see such imperfections and it took you out of the movie, combined with this new filming speed.

If I had to name my biggest complaints, it would be the fight scenes; every last one of them.  They're all the same: party gets stuck into some sort of impossible situation with enemies twice or larger their size.  Even with so many dwarves they still manage to get beat down and either tied up, incapacitated, or stuck.  In every situation except one, Bilbo is the one that saves them.  This is stark opposite of the trilogy where Frodo didn't do hardly anything.  In fact Frodo was more of a coward than Bilbo in the movie even though the book has Bilbo being less willing to chip in and save the day.

Then there is the introduction of Bilbo to Gollum.  A lot of people applaud this as the best scene in the movie, but frankly it was nothing special.  The Gollum character was played well, and the creepy mannerisms are something to behold, but the scene itself was quite unremarkable.

Frankly, it was not a bad movie nor was it too long.  I didn't get the same sense of overall fulfillment from it that I got from Fellowship, nor did I gain much from the Bilbo character here.  Bilbo in the trilogy was a lot more entertaining overall, and ""The Hobbit"" at times felt mislabeled; as though it should have been called ""The Dwarven Quest"" because they dominated the screenplay almost exclusively.  This might have been in response to complaints about Frodo and Sam dominating the trilogy; I'm not sure.  In any case, as long as you don't bring book bias the movie is worth a watch.  But don't expect it to blow you away.  It's a decent movie, not a great one.

If you buy the Blu-ray be sure to opt for the triple set with 3D Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD.  It was 2 bucks more than the non-3D version.  If you do get a 3D TV in the future then you'll already be set.  I wouldn't worry about the extended edition unless you're so fan clouded you must have it, but I felt the movie was quite long enough.",1363737600,,8236,4.462876254180602
4639117,4,B0059XTU1S,"As a huge fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR films, I had mixed thoughts going into ""The Hobbit."" The novel simply is not the stuff for a movie trilogy. With almost universal condemnation of Jackson's high speed filming efforts, I was expecting ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to be as bad as George Lucas' revisiting the Star Wars Universe in ""The Phantom Menace.""

So do we have Bilbo Binks here? Not quite. The high speed filming works on the landscapes but simply doesn't work on the actors. Fake feet and prosthetic noses look like too much like fake feet and prosthetic noses when all is said and done. The plot does seem a bit stretched out. Even with some new scenes setting the stage for the LOTR movies, I can see two films here but not three.

The cast is solid. Martin Freeman is fine as Bilbo. Ian McKellan slides back nicely into the role of Gandalf. Richard Armitage is solid as Thorin Oakenshield. Cameos of characters from the original trilogy--Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Elijah Woods--are excellent. Andy Serkins once again amazes as Gollum in the high point of the movie. A host of dwarves get their moments but the only one who truly gets fleshed out is Balin, excellently played by Ken Stott.

It's certainly fun to revisit old friends like Gandalf and Elrond. With so many familiar locations--the Shire, Rivendell, even what appears to be Weathertop--fans of the original films should enjoy this movie even if it does not match the magic of the LOTR films. Still, while there are some fun action scenes at the end, the movie drags a little too much to be great and the high speed filming is often distracting. If not a great film though, there`s enough in ""An Unexpected Journey"" to recommend it.",1363737600,,1748,4.705882352941177

I think the dwarfs in this movie were weakly portrayed. Their characteristics where that of a gnome than a dwarf. The dwarf in ""Lord of the Rings"" is my basis for what I expect a dwarf to act like.

Humor and special effects are always great in any movie; however, if it is done improperly (as it was here) it distracts from the story line. A few well timed remarks of irony or a character which showed a sense of humor would have been appropriate. This movies had everyone making remarks throughout them movie. The special effects were good but without well trained actors the directors seemed to relied to heavily on them.

In trying to spice things up, Peter Jackson turned this into a cheap Hollywood flick which relies more on the overwrought battle scenes than on substance or story. The dangers (like the battle scenes) are exaggerated to the point that it is no longer fun to watch, and this is made worse by the pace--which is too fast, so that you are wrenched from one overly dramatic scene to another. Fans of the books will be sorely disappointed since the film necessarily takes a tremendous degree of liberty in order to accomplish the supra-fabulousness it strives for: much of the story is deleted, battle scenes are trumped up and many scenes are just added right in. The appeal of the book is the humble characters and similarly humble story-line.

Generally risk-adverse Bilbo asks: ""Will I come back?""  Gandalf answers: ""I can't guarantee that.  And if you do come back, you won't come back the same.""

4639142,4,B0059XTU1S,"I should begin by saying that I was a huge fan of the original LOTR trilogy. I was already a fan of the books and the movies exceeded my expectations. I was also very excited when I heard that Peter Jackson was not only making The Hobbit, but that it was going to be a trilogy. I know some people complain about the length of these movies, but I get lost in these films like no others, so I could watch for hours, and I was looking forward to nine more hours of hobbit tales and adventure.

The truth is, it would have been almost impossible for Peter Jackson to make a hobbit movie that I did not like. I have already bought into the whole world, and any trip to Middle Earth is going to be a trip that I enjoy. I just finished watching The Hobbit for the first time and I certainly enjoyed it. There are a lot things, I think, to enjoy in this movie. There are a whole host of new characters (all the dwarves), as well as a lot of returning characters. There is more background on the history of Middle Earth. There are, of course, lots of stunning visuals. I felt like all the actors did their jobs well. I was particularly pleased with Martin Freeman, who I very much enjoyed in the BBC Sherlock Holmes specials, as a young Bilbo Baggins. I think most of the die hard fans of the original trilogy will find a lot to enjoy here.

That having been said, there did seem to me to be something missing from this film. It is something mysterious. Perhaps it is simply the lack of surprise. When I went to see The Fellowship of the Ring in theaters I had no idea what to expect, and I was blown away, and I felt like each successive movie managed to blow me away in a new way. Now, we pretty much know what to expect, and I feel like this movie, perhaps for that reason, did not have the same impact on me as the originals. I also felt like it was more difficult to differentiate between the dwarves. One of the things that made the original trilogy great was that each main character had a unique personality and it was great watching them interact. A few dwarves manage to stand out, but so far, they are sort of one giant collective character. That is not necessarily Peter Jackson's fault. He is just following the book, and in The Hobbit the companions are all dwarves, rather than one dwarf, one elf, two humans, one wizard, and four hobbits, but I think it might be one reason I was not as enthralled with this movie.

Now, that having been said, Peter Jackson did set up some really interesting stuff for the next two movies. I was particularly pleased with the introduction of The Necromancer who promises to be an interesting foe. And, of course, Smaug will play more of a role in the other movies. I have a secret hope that Peter Jackson is going to find a way to fit Tom Bombadil into the trilogy, since he was left out of the original trilogy, but that is probably an unrealistic hope. There was, obviously, a lot of setting up to do in this movie, and that is probably another reason I was not as enthralled with this movie as I was with the original trilogy.

4639144,4,B0059XTU1S,"Did we expect too much, perhaps?  With LOTR already having set the bar soaringly high, it seemed as The Hobbit's first of three acts, this being ""An Unexpected Journey"" had no choice but to disappoint. And seemingly a 300 page book stretched to three movies is a bit of a stretch- in fact, the book's infamous opening line, ""In a hole in the ground, there once lived a hobbit..."" doesn't ring out of the speakers until exactly 9 minutes and 18 seconds into the movie. Thing is though, people have to realize that this isn't something epic... well, it is, in its own way. But it's the beginning of something epic, first and foremost. The Hobbit was always a simple tale, and while the simplicity is there in this first act, I can gladly say that the Hobbit deserves more put into it than perhaps people want to admit. As the great grey wizard himself says, ""All good stories deserve embellishment"".

I saw this film twice when it was in the cinemas- once at midnight in 48 FPS and again two nights later in IMAX 3D at 7 PM on a Saturday. While I loved it then, at the same time I needed to give it time to ""sink in"", sort of. People fail to realize that as simple as Tolkien's masterpiece is, there's more to it than the books allow us to see. The appendices are full of material that add to both The Hobbit and LOTR, and I'm glad to see they brought some material into the film. One good example was how they handled Radagast The Brown- played by Sylvester McCoy, formerly of Doctor Who fame. His inclusion could have been a disaster, but the way they handled him, he fit in there comfortably, and his role in the story does a lot more than most realize.

What really did it for me about this film though, other than what they included and excluded (because face it, it's a MOVIE, not a book. The book was great but it's time to hand in our brains and just try to enjoy the movie) is how they handled the story in terms of tone and technicality. The first half charmed me and was just plain cute. Sure it had the typical ""R-rated opening"" that the previous films had, but after that, when we get a glimpse into Bilbo's life and the introduction to the 13 elves, from there on it is as endearing as a beloved children's tale. Yet even then, the first half isn't afraid to get all dark and gritty- Thorin's telling of the story of the White Orc is beyond tragic and you really feel for the elves. And when we shift into the action-packed second half- from there on the film just blows your mind. I loved Gollum's cameo- it was funny as hell and scary too, and his scenes with Bilbo are just as fun as the intercut action scenes between the orcs, Gandalf and the elves. Also, the last 30 minutes may be the most exciting in a while. I can't remember the last time I've been that on the edge of my seat.

Is The Hobbit a ""great"" film, per se? Maybe not. I don't know, honestly. All I know is that I really enjoyed it, as a fan of the book, and if anything, as high as my expectations were, they weren't high enough, if the multiple viewings were any indication. I definitely feel that the book has been done great justice, and it does what all ""first act"" movies should do- leave me wanting more. Sure it's full of flaws, but isn't everything, nowadays? And besides, The Hobbit gives another few years of Middle Earth to look forward to, so that's a plus.

4639146,5,B0059XTU1S,"I got the 3D Bluray version. I was a bit surprised that the entire movie fits in one Bluray disc, yet the 3D discs are part 1 and 2. Although if you think about it its a movie shot in 3D at 48 frames per second that goes on towards almost 3 hours. So after realizing this I am not surprised. The 3D version comes in the typical larger Bluray holder with 2 3D discs, 1 Bluray with standard form, Another Bluray for the ""Special Features"", DVD of what I guess is the movie as well, and a redemption code for the Ultraviolet Digital Copy and the Sneak Peak event. All in all, a really good deal, and certainly the typical 3D Blu ray package. The Movie is amazing, I was simply blown away in the movie theater when I went with my Best Friend and have waited to see it again in 3D in Bluray format. Again just to remind people you need a 3D bluray player or PS3, 3D TV, and 3D glasses that go with the TV, this is not a 3D with glasses included type stuff that used to happen awhile ago. (Although I'm guessing everyone already knows that. Just thought I'd mention it.) I'd say everyone should get this, its a can't miss movie and in my opinion better than all 3 of the Lord of the Rings movies. 5/5

As far as extended edition goes, there is not much info out there but I hear around Christmas there will be a release of it that includes 20 to 30 minutes more of content. While that is probably a given, 3D is mostly not a given. I almost doubt they would re-release it in 3D, mostly because Avatar extended 3D didn't happen, as well as others. If WB wants more money they may milk it that way by having this only 3D and the other not, so you pay double for the experience.  Also given that 3D isn't still in every home TV so its a select audience that will be paying for it, and might not be worth the cost of making more 2 disc 3D Blu Rays (maybe 3?) Again this is my speculation that this might be the only 3D release of this movie, until maybe a box set. Also, I personally don't need the extended edition, this has enough movie for me. My extended editions of The Lord of the Rings tend to be watched on rare occasions since they are SOO long. This movie in its Theatrical format is pretty long and I don't need to have 20 minutes to 30 minutes more. I'm content with this film and expect the other two to just be as amazing.

4639156,3,B0059XTU1S,"I saw the movie in IMAX 3D with the special 48 fps version and found it to have the soap opera look, i.e., like it was filmed with a camcorder.  There was no theatrical feel of atmosphere and depth but instead it was jerky and awkward.  The movement of the actors felt rushed and lacking in fluidity and made for some scenes with Bilbo that looked like they should have had another cut.  Assuming there is any hope for this fast format at all, I wonder if they aren't properly treating the film in the post processing side of things perhaps because they are releasing so many formats that the 48 fps version is an afterthought and not given its due. But i'm skeptical.

In any case, for me the soap opera feel made it hard to enjoy any part of the film.  And it has nothing to do with having experience playing computer games or anything else.  I grew up and play to this day computer games.  I know all about and enjoy them and the benefits of high frame rates that make for fast smooth movement.  Films are not computer games.  I think some people are more sensitive to this and some aren't, judging by the comments here.  On my 60"" Elite LED TV, i have certain filters turned off so ever blu-ray i watch doesn't have this super clean camcorder look.  Needless to say it was disappointing to see PJ usher in an era (possibly) where the theater will suffer this problem for me and many others.  Hopefully we'll be given a choice about which version of a release we can watch.

Beyond that issue, I also felt the movie was way to long which is a severe problem Peter Jackson has, judging by the monstrosity King Kong turned out to be and now The Hobbit (one small book turned into a sprawling trilogy).  PJ really is guilty of, creatively speaking, the sin of gluttony.  Movies are supposed to be concise productions with every moment distilled to its essence.  Instead, this movie is an orgy of self indulgence and fabrication.  Sadly some people do not handle the creative freedom of success and become undisciplined.  Instead of focusing on Tolkien's story and realizing it faithfully it's now Peter Jackson's story and never mind the source.  In movies and many creative endeavors, less is more.

In any case it is what it is and I intend to next view the standard theatrical edition Blu-ray and it should not have the soap opera look.  I will finally be able to experience the movie properly and have a better experience.  I'll update this review after purchasing the extended edition (better value that includes both versions).",1363564800,,2533,4.533039647577093
4639157,5,B0059XTU1S,"This is really a classic story about leaving home and the journey to get back home again. The details are the fun and adventure. The Hobbit was the original story by Tolkien for his grandchildren. It retains some the the bedtime story elements in this movie. It is much less serious as LoTR, but even more serious in the strong emotional tie to your home. The dragon, sadly, is the last one in Middle Earth, and the tale about reclaiming the dwarves home is a mountain of gold. You only get a teaser of the dragon in this movie, but you really feel like you signed the papers to join this dwarf company too. Tolkien could have made a long running TV series based on his in depth creations. This movie is better than LoTR because it rests on the veterans that made LoTR a masterpiece.

It sometimes feels too similar to a theme-park ride, with the visuals overwhelming the screen occasionally-- but for the most part, the movie finds a nice balance blending realism and the humanity of the heroes with the fantastical elements of Middle-earth. Another small problem was the film's duration: 2 hours and 45 minutes is quite beefy, and there are noticeable fillers that Jackson implemented to find that length. I don't know why he wanted it to be that long, perhaps he thought that would enhance the grandness of the movie, to complement its scale. I think it could've been at least 15 minutes shorter. But the finale is quite a feat, the cast is whimsical and likable, and the magic still holding strong. I'm very much looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug.",1363564800,,1003,4.7701149425287355

More length, more action, more orcs, more hairbreadth (and, to be honest, harebrained) escapes. He really has tried to turn the Don's sweet sad little book into an epic to match 'LOTR'. But this time a lot of his additions and changes (except for bringing in the Necromancer and the prologue to the War of the Ring) don't really work. They look more like padding. I reeeally got tired of hordes of orcs showing up everywhere for more mind-numbing ear-busting CGI action, and the obligatory Miracle Rescue by the Eagles. Being a bit of a Ringer myself, I'm still irritated at PJ's separating orcs from goblins, when all the goblins were, were early versions of orcs, before Tolkein renamed them. Kept seeing bits of 'Fellowship' and 'Return' here, thinly re-imagined, especially in the goblin's caverns, and double-especially when they go riding on collapsing bridges just like the stairs in Moria with zillions of goblins nipping at their heels. AGAIN. I can see why del Toro opted out. In the late 60's Rankin-Bass did an animated 'Hobbit' that I much prefer. It starred Orson Bean as Bilbo, John Huston as Gandalf, Richard Boone as a truly nasty Smaug, and some creep named Brother Theodore as Gollum, who, unlike Andy Serkis, remembered how Gollum got his name, and it wasn't from an asthmatic cough. They got the whole story done in an hour and a half, and did right by it. And unlike the trilogy, I CAN wait a year for the next episode.",1363564800,4,1610,4.692579505300353

4639178,3,B0059XTU1S,"A strange thing happened to me the other night when I watched ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" on Blu-ray in the comfort of my own home. I actually enjoyed it much more than I did seeing it in the theater in its ""intended"" 48 FPS. I'll confess I never gave it a chance in 3D for fear that I might embarrass myself by blowing chunks in the person's hair seated in front of me.

Don't get me wrong. There are still many things wrong with Peter Jackson's first entry into his new Middle-earth saga. However, it was easier to be forgiving when viewed in 24 FPS.

""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" tells the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure outside his comfort zone of the Shire in the wilds of Middle-earth. The wizard Gandalf and his band of dwarves need a master burglar to accompany them on their quest to retake their kingdom from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they run into a number of different obstacles including orcs, goblins, and a strange creature calling himself Gollum.

Re-visiting my earlier theatrical review of the movie, I found opinions of certain aspects swaying a bit. The backstory for the Wizard of the Woods wasn't nearly as tedious as I remembered it being. It was actually quite entertaining and humorous this time around. The CGI wasn't nearly as noticeably awful as it was on the big screen, although there was still an air of artificialness to almost every frame of the film.

The biggest problem with ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is its structure. I can't shake the feeling that the film has no real rhythm. It's just a series of actions and cause and effects with no real organization.

The high-definition transfer is top notch for the most part. I was surprised to notice some banding in one night scene, but that was the only complaint I can think of. The audio is stunning and will please home audiences with its 7.1 surround sound. You'll feel as if you're sitting in the center of Middle-earth, which could be good on a peaceful day in the Shire or bad if you're in the thick of a battle with Gandalf and the dwarves.

Bonus material for the Blu-ray version of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is contained on a separate disc from the feature film. They include 127 minutes of ""Behind-the-Scenes"" video blogs addressing everything from location scouting to filming in 3D. There's a tour of New Zealand's countryside, also referred to as the ""Home of Middle-earth."" Six full and alternate trailers are found as well. Trailers for ""Kingdoms of Middle-earth,"" ""Guardians of Middle-earth"" and ""LEGO LOTR"" will excite gaming fans. A Sneak Peek Access Code for ""The Desolation of Smaug"" rounds out the special features.

If you had issues with the 48 FPS and 3D presentations of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" I would give it another chance on Blu-ray or DVD. It's a great deal easier on the eyes and doesn't highlight the limitations of the CGI as much as the theatrical viewing experience did. I was pleased with my second trip to early Middle-earth, although I'm fairly certain it will be my last until ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" comes out.",1363564800,4,3117,4.708256880733945

You couldn't ask for better material than The Hobbit and the first film does not disappoint for surpassing the high bar Peter Jackson and his crew set with the lotr trilogy. The New Zealand middle-earth cinematography is fine as ever and the digital magic is close to seamless now, such as technology have evolved.

4639182,4,B0059XTU1S,"It's been a long time since I've read THE HOBBIT.  I wasn't one of those who read it in elementary; my father first gave it to me then, but I didn't get into it.  Then The Fellowship of the Ring came out and I just had to read the books so I would know how it all turned out.  Waiting for the other two movies was not an option.  But yes, I started with THE HOBBIT.  I loved the books, but I haven't read them again since.  I'm not sure why.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - movie version - contained the two scenes not involving Smaug that I remembered most clearly, the trolls and the riddle game.  There were a few things that I knew were absolutely not in the book, such as there being both goblins and orcs.  (Also, a necromancer?  What?)  Other things I've found afterwards were small details in the book expanded to ten minute action sequences.  And that makes sense to me - action sequences play even better on the screen than in a novel.

I honestly have no clue why Peter Jackson is turning The Hobbit into a trilogy.  I think most of the changes he made worked.  This version will tie in tightly to his Lord of the Rings.  But while I enjoyed this film, I have no clue how there is enough of THE HOBBIT left to make two more films.  But honestly, the man has delivered good films so far, so I am inclined to trust him.  I was quite wary of An Unexpected Journey, and then I absolutely loved it.

Jackson has a knack for casting.  Even when I knew the faces, they tended to disappear into their roles.  I didn't realize Kili was Aiden Turner (Mitchell in Being Human) until the credits rolled.  And he's incredibly lucky, because apparently Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, and Hugo Weaving haven't aged in ten years.  It's uncanny.

Although he adds in scenes to tie The Hobbit more closely to The Lord of the Rings, Jackson's adaptation proves that he understood the difference between the books.  This is a funnier movie, and he keeps several of the songs.  I am very tempted to buy the soundtrack.  I feel sorry for anyone in anyway related to high school band, because I am sure a large number of shows next year will be based on Howard Shore's score.  (I can still remember all of The Lord of the Rings shows I sat though in high school.  Thankfully my school couldn't afford the popular stuff.)

I did attend a high-frame rate showing.  In case you haven't heard, Jackson shot The Hobbit at twice the usual frame rate.  Reports so far haven't been glowing.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it added anything to the movie.  (My dad concurs.)  It was most noticeable in brightly lit scenes.  If you ever watch making of documentaries, it looks like when they show bits of raw footage from angles that weren't used in the final film.  As for the 3D, it didn't really add anything either.  It's a beautiful film, but not one where things are leaping at you.  I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen, but I don't think you'll lose anything by attending an el cheapo 2D showing.

4639204,5,B0059XTU1S,"A humble hobbit joins a band of dwarves who require a burglar to help them retrieve their lost birthright from a marauding dragon.

Director and co-screenwriter Peter Jackson has launched another massive fantasy trilogy based on the work of J.R.R. Tolkien.  This time the source material is a comparatively thin volume, but Jackson has delved deep into Tolkien's elaborate appendices in order to expand it.  Is this a cynical cash grab intended to capitalize on the success of Lord of the Rings or a respectful attempt to bring Tolkien's world to life in the most fully-formed version possible?  For the studio, it's no doubt the former but I think for Jackson and his co-creators it is the latter.  I am in full sympathy with those who find this film bloated and  unwieldy, but I loved almost every minute of it and look forward to the inevitable expanded edition on DVD.  It's great to see such familiar faces as Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Andy Serkis/Gollum, and (especially) Christopher Lee.  Martin Freeman makes the ideal Bilbo.

4639206,5,B0059XTU1S,"Being a near 60 year-old, I have been in love with Tolkien's Hobbit and Middle World fantasy for a long time--since my teenage years.  I introduced the Fellowship of the Ring movie to my sons when it first came out and they became big fans too--seeing it repeatedly in the theaters and with great anticipation and a famished appetite, consumed the next two parts of the trilogy when they finally arrived in theaters.  We bought the VCR and DVD versions and would have marathon watching sessions together often.  They introduced it to my grandchildren so the tradition continues.

Even though I no longer enjoy going to see many movies in the theater, I decided that I wanted to see the Hobbit with a full screen and sound of a theater.  I even went alone so I would not be distracted by conversation with anyone else.  I was prepared to see the ""slow parts"" reviewers warned would be there.  However, I didn't experience any scenes that were slow at all.  It was a story that had me engaged the whole way through as well as having amazing cinematography and other qualities that are best experienced at least once in a theater.  I have come to think that the reviewers lacked the understanding of how good conversation and narrations really give the heart and soul of a good story.  This movie restores that quality to the mix better than any I have seen in decades, including the Lord of the Ring.  Action scenes are there to enhance and illustrate the story more completely, but they should not be the foundation of it. If action and great cinematography is the foundation of the story in a movie, it lacks staying power and is hollow.  This is a movie I will enjoy and get more out of it each time I watch it.  This is a movie of great substance and balance that will also be wonderful to watch at home using any device we have available to see it.  None of the artists who brought us this product were lacking.",1363392000,5,1914,4.478386167146974
4639207,2,B0059XTU1S,"Glad to see the enthusiasm to Tolkien writings - read the books at least a dozen times many years ago - and waited just about half a life time for it to be made into a movie.

 The title reflects my opinion of a lack of following to the book. Why I do not understand it. Was expecting a close to the book rendition as was almost done with the Lord of the Rings books.

 If you did read the book the Hobbit: The initial meeting with Gandalf whilst Bilbo was enjoying his pipe out doors was in the reading a comedy - as Gandalf is really not portrayed as seriously as the movie depicts - especially with the arrival of the Dwarves - each with their colored hoods could have been done better. This seemed to be a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Director/Producer. There are other disappointments I noted but the most obvious is the part with Radagast the Brown with the Spiders which did NOT occur in the book and was not interesting at all - nearly fell asleep at the theatre. The other is the interpretation of the encounter with the Orcs in the cave. If you know how to read it states Bilbo DREAMED the floor of the cave fell away and saw the attack of the Orcs. The book reads - Bilbo saw a part (key words a part of) of his dream was in fact happening with the Orcs rushing in -bla, bla accuracy to the book is what makes a movie a solid hit. I do realize YOU NEW followers to Tolkeins story has resulted into an over-enthusiastic acceptance of the movie as created. But clearly (YAWN)it missed the mark by a long shot.
 Sorry to say - I may or may NOT purchase the extended version when it is released. Yes their will be as money will be made to soak as much from YOU as possible. Initial version, then extended then some form of HD, Blu-ray or whatever - money makes the world go 'round!!!

A quote from my friend sum it up nicely.  After dropping her off, I got a phone call.  ""It's four o'clock!  How long was that movie?  I had no idea it was that long cause it just flew by!""  People might have their opinions on how the movie should or shouldn't have been split into three almost 3 hour movies, but the fact is that the movie's pace doesn't really suffer for it.  I like to consider myself open minded to letting the director tell the story he wanted to tell thing the movie is fine how it is.

The good news is there is no disputing that the 3D and special effects are the best of any movie to date.  On my Samsung 8000 series, I only saw cross talk during the Riddles in the Dark sequence and only an two or three shots.  And the picture is absolutely stunning.  This is definitely a reference quality Bluray and a welcom addtion to anytone's collection.  It's up there with Avatar as a movie you can show off your tv with.  Also, the sound and music are perfectly executed.  Dialogue is always clear.  And the production diaries do an amazing job of showing how absolutely monumental the task was that Peter Jackson set out to accomplish.

4639233,4,B0059XTU1S,"Excellent movie.  By far better than most fantasy or sci-fi flicks made in the last decade.  Unfortunately, it is a bit too oriented toward kids.  It does not follow the book faithfully, but that's ok.  The book had very little action.  This movie had a lot of action.  Unfortunately, no blood.  Even lopped off heads are clean and dry.  Which is incredibly stupid.  But the action is intense and enjoyable.  Very innovative and visually spectacular.

Sometimes the film does not take itself seriously.  The dwarves are akin to Snow White's 7 from Disney too often.  I had been expecting Jackson to make a grittier, realistic, foreboding tale of Bilbo's discovery and the dwarves' heart-wrenching quest for their home.  But sometimes the dwarves are silly.

Rhadagast the Brown was a turned into a silly twit with comedic timing and stupid expressions.  In the books he is a mysterious wizard like Gandalf!  Nobody knows much about him.  Give us some cool wizard whose magic is at one with the forest and the elements.  Not some dope out of a Disney cartoon!

The opening scenes with old Bilbo and Frodo are superfluous--a bit boring.

1) The action scenes are fun and innovative, but no blood.  And, yes, sometimes you cannot see what everyone is doing.  But these scenes are worth re-watching.

Funny, because each of those dwarves should have been spotlighted in combat sequences choreographed for their characters.  The actors are more than up to the task.  The dwarves are each so different and interesting that Jackson truly could have characterized each dwarf through action.  But the movie failed to make any of the dwarves special, in my opinion.  Except maybe Thorin and Kili.

2) The settings and character make-up and costumes are all excellent.  The movie is beautiful to behold.  The effects are often very realistic.  Only the Goblin King is a stupid kid's movie creature.  He even jokes as he is dying.  Very poor writing at that moment.

3) The acting is superb.  No one does a bad job.  No one.  Even the extras are truly entertaining and in character, whether standing around or in action scenes.  This Bilbo is the true Bilbo.  Forget the one from LOTR.

4) The soundtrack is excellent, moody, appropriate.  Even the stupid dwarf dish-cleaning song is actually in the book, so that is ok, I suppose.  Still hard to bear, when you are hoping for a serious movie.  It's cute.

Anyway, there is much more to praise than hate about this film.  Overall it is a beautiful action film that Tolkien fans HAVE to own.  It has its mediocre parts, but these are well-done mediocrity far above most of the drivel Hollywood pukes out all year.

So with love in my heart, I say give it a watch.  It is often brilliant.  If you are a fantasy lover, BUY IT.",1363305600,15,2761,4.7094736842105265
4639234,5,B0059XTU1S,"Sick of the constant idiotic comments from whiners still living off their parents into their 30's and 40's, those are the ones stamping their wickle footsies. Thought they were gone after the Trilogy. No, they are back, lonely as ever. Brats are complaining about not being offered something that doesn't even exist yet! They are splitting up a one film book into 3 movies!...and they still whine!

What is wrong with wanting the same version you saw (and enjoyed!) at the movie theater and the movie studio supplying that demand?

Being forced to buy against your will? No! Product being misrepresented/false advertising (are they pretending its extended and giving you theatrical?) No! They are merely OFFERING (no obligation!) for sale the same cut as people saw in the movie theatre! Wow...those b*stards! You mean whats for sale is the same movie that was for sale in the cinema a few months ago that we paid to see? OMG we are being ripped off!..who on Earth would pay to see the movie and then...heavens..want to own the same version at home?

Well, some film fans do prefer theatrical cuts. Yep, they do...er...yes they do. Freedom of choice and opinion, is that ok?, especially on a film that was stretched way more than it could have been from a book way smaller than the LOTR.
The ironic thing is that some of these clowns are the same brats whining about the Trilogy editions not being extended immediately, and are now going on about this movie being too long...and yet...they want an extended edition of said ""too long,slow paced"" movie!

Can you really please all the people all the time? Well, they try don't they,after all its more profitable to sell to as many customers as possible, with both versions! They would be dumb to sell both at same time.

The real problem?...endemic of this once great country...the culture of  ""I want it this way and I want it now"" and I'll throw a hissy fit if I don't get it. Yes I will...I'll scream and scream and scream like a baby. Spoiled brats plain and simple.

It's called patience, learn some, its useful. If you had some you wouldn't be throwing your pacifier out of the stroller right now. It'll still be the extended version whenever its released...you just can't have it now! Had your Parents done the right thing by you, you'd be ok with this. The wait for something desirable makes obtaining it, at last, more satisfying.

Ok, Mommy let you down, so heres what she should have taught you. Seriously...YOU can't have it now...deal with it...whine and whine...you 'ain't getting it until those ""evil haha:-)"" studio bosses say you can...suck it up spoiled brats..this is another thing you are not getting your way on...your too small to boss them around...they do not care what you think, its THEIR business NOT yours.

They obviously did very well out of this strategy for the LOTR Trilogy, which is why they are sticking to it! IT MAKES MONEY! Thats the aim ya' know. Why earn millions less (that can go into making more great films!) to satisfy a very vocal but relatively small group of whingers? It's not called the movie ""business"" for no reason!

A relatively small book is being milked and padded into 3 movies to make 3 times as much money than one would, because you people will buy it of your own free will...and you want extended editions of something thats been stretched way more than it maybe should!?!

You know if they had released the extended first, you'd only moan it was rushed and not finished properly and theres some 'green tint fog' malarky going on.

Unless they are advertising ""extended edition"" (they 'aint!) and you were lied to for your money, then it is NOT  a rip-off. They are selling exactly what they are describing.

This movie was ridiculous. In includes superfluous, made-up scenes that detract from the feel of the story. It provides background that has nothing to do with the story of the Hobbit at all. Something that is beautiful about the book is that Bilbo finds a ring that is magical...and that's it. There is no crazy foreshadowing of its meaning in Middle Earth...which is what, I think, makes it so mind-blowing in the LOTR trilogy. They just packed in too much and tried to hard to create a link between this and FOTR/Saron/etc.
This book is far shorter than any of the Lords of the Rings books, and yet Peter Jackson wants to turn it into 3 near-3 hour movies? How very George Lucas of him...
Speaking of which, part of the reason why this movie bothered me so much as its portrayal of the dwarves. If you like Jar Jar Binks, I think that you will certainly be in line with the way the dwarves are presented in this movie; buffoons.
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or make itself a kids movie. It reminds me a lot of Star Wars Episode I in that regard. What I learned from that experience was to not waste any more time hoping that the next 2 installations will redeem the first film...which is why I won't even bother with the next 2.

As the for the vision of the story, I was disappointed. I think if the original director had stayed we would have a much better movie just for a ""different"" experience. I feel The Hobbit by Jackson brought nothing new. You could have have picked it all out of deleted scenes from LOTR. Scenery, action, presentation must have come from the same story boards as LOTR. The dwarves look weird. Nothing as good as 'Gimli' and they are not near as interesting. The song in Bilbo's house is just stupid...did Jackson get Disney's Snow white dwarves confused?

All in all, the movie was good...not great like ALL of the LOTR movies. Jackson's un-creative deviations from Tolkien's real story to stretch the series to three movies (a simple money grab) are nonsense just like his ""non-story"" changes in LOTR (eg: skull avalanche, Saruman's death, and no battle for the Shire).

Note: the 3D was nothing special and often not experiential. So I don't think I will pay the extra for the 3D bluray. Also, Jackson ALWAYS SCREWS US BY RELEASING THE EXTENDED VERSION A HALF YEAR LATER. WHY PAY FOR LESS?

This is the second title I have bought on Amazon as a digital only version in the last month.  The chance to own it early and to watch it on all my devices for a great price is just too good to pass up.

I found the dialog between characters dull and downright boring, it seemed to lack energy and there were entire segments that i found pointless and mundane.
The dialog between The main Character the Hobbit and his supporting lead the Wizard was so dry and forced i found myself yawning.
Entire segments of monolog that made no sense were inserted into the film, conversations that seemed to go on and on with no apparent conclusion nor any point of reference .
Then there was the posing of the Elvin Queen her dress was more important than her actual character and entire segments were devoted to her posing this way and that way. (a pointless display of her beauty) the entire segment felt forced and exaggerated.
The Dialog between the Wizard and his mentor the white wizard were so low key and so softly spoken i had to turn up the volume just to make out what they were saying.
Entire conversations with no reason or rhyme about the incapability of the hobbit to make it on the journey were dragged on and on to the point of sheer ludicrous exaggeration .

4639261,5,B0059XTU1S,"Some background on me: it's been nearly 40 years since the first time I read The Hobbit. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are my two favorite novels of all time. I own paperback versions that are so old the covers are torn. I own newer versions and I bought the kindle versions. Okay, I'm a little crazy about these books.

I went to see An Unexpected Journey with mild trepidation. I had read some of the professional reviews. My brother saw it before I did and said ""It dragged."" But it was Peter Jackson, the man who brought LOTR to life so well. And I'd bought the tickets for my 17-year daughter and I to see the IMAX 3D version. So we went. And we loved it.

Can I ask a silly question? What's wrong with a story taking its time to tell it's tale? One can hardly claim that ""An Unexpected Journey"" doesn't have action, it certainly does and plenty of it. Orcs and goblins fighting with dwarves, not to mention trolls and giants. But the story isn't afraid to breathe, to draw things out a little, to let us gaze in wonder while we contemplate the wonders that Peter Jackson & crew have bestowed upon us. My favorite moment: gliding on the wings of eagles through the Misty Mountains. I'd pictured that moment when I first read the book, almost 4 decades ago. And Jackson captured it perfectly. Have we been so inundated with movies like ""Transformers"" with so much action and so little plot that we all have ADHD when it comes to watching a movie? (and for the record, I didn't care for the Transformers).

It's a fair point that ""An Unexpected Journey"" is not completely faithful to the source material. There's a lot of added material and most of it Jackson made up on his own. But he did that with LOTR and I don't see people whining about it (now). And for the most part, the changes made work. If pressed I'd have to say that I wish the troll scene was more like the book.

Maybe it's not your cup of tea (or pipe-weed to smoke). But for this Hobbit fan, I was enthralled. I can't wait for The Desolation of Smaug! And my daughter absolutely adores Richard Armitage. My only conundrum: buy the theatrical version now or wait for the extended edition? That's a tough one. No, WB, I'm not buying both. I'm leaning towards the theatrical version because although the deleted scenes might be interesting, this isn't the LOTR where I'm hoping to see scenes cut from the movie that were in the book like Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship.

Update - conundrum solved! Thank you DirecTV and Pay Per View! I recorded ""An Unexpected Journey"" off pay per view and burned to a DVD.

The decision not to purchase was made all the easier by the fact that ""The Hobbit"", while a good movie, is not a compelling as ""The Lord of the Rings"". I saw each of the the three LOTR movie several times in the theater, but I only felt compelled to watch ""The Hobbit"" the one time. To be clear, Martin Freeman is absolutely brilliant as Bilbo, but the tone of the movie is all over the place. Much of that problem flows directly from the source material (The Hobbit is much lighter and sillier than LOTR), but I fault the screenwriters with failing to come up with a more consistent tone for the script.

Given the ""so so"" impression the movie made on me, the lack of extras (New Line loves to double- and even triple-dip), and their pig-headed support for Ultraviolet, I suggest you simply take a pass on purchasing ""The Hobbit"" and rent it instead.

Well, like my son, I'm dismayed at the bad reviews and at those who say the movie is too long or seems to have filler.  Perhaps it does have filler, in a sense, since the powers-that-be decided to make it a three-part item.  However, it's not like they went back and filmed more, right?, in order to make filler?  It was all planned, and as with all movies, parts are later cut out (in this case, they left more in).  Anyway, my son is 15 and has ADHD, and HE did not think the movie was too long.  Lol.  I have to wonder at our sound-bite culture that thinks this action packed movie is too long.

They could have cut quite a bit of that out and it would have improved the film immensely.

He has changed a number of aspects of the story - eg the trolls scenes- one wonders why?  The dwarves are verging on the ridiculous but just manage to pull it off and Martin Freeman is - as was Elijah Wood - an unexpected but clever piece of casting.

4639275,2,B0059XTU1S,"Before you object, please keep in mind that this is ONE opinion about ONE aspect of the Middle-earth films.

Ok I kept this bottled up for a long time but I must make my feelings of absolute despair known about Peter Jasckson's obsession with cheap gags and so-called ""comic relief."" If you want to include SOME humorous moments I can see that as reasonable, but Jackson didn't give any thought at all to his slapstick and juvenile (and sometimes scatalogical!) humor. At least put some thought into it Jackson. Like every other element in a film expected to draw a reaction from the viewer, humor has to be EARNED. You can't have Gimli burping in the middle of a serious disagreement between two kings discussing the safety of their peoples, and expect to get an Oscar for the acting in that scene, or any others which involve Gimli's gags and pratfalls. One other reviewer on here said he had taken a class on Tolkien in college. Well, let me tell you I TAUGHT a college course on Tolkien, which testifies to my great love for Tolkien's work. The most egregious and insulting misrepresentation or misinterpretation of Tolkien's work is to cast both the Hobbits and the Dwarves as comic fools. First of all, Jackson does not seem to understand that Merry and Pippin are upper-class hobbits, with a sort of nobility, if you like. And Frodo and Bilbo are considered strange, nouveau riche, figures by the people of Hobbitown. I assume Jackson just took the easiest, most puerile route in making short characters the foolish ones, both in the Hobbit and in the LotR trilogy. The bit when Pippin volunteers for the quest and asks ""where are we going?"" was indeed in the book, but Jackson totally misread (or disregarded) the context of it. It was intended to be a very ""English"" demonstration of Pippin's wit, not a show of stupidity (it goes back to the style of Restoration Drama, wherein the upper classes were always jockeying for a chance to put their wit on display). Also, did Jackson even read The Silmarillion, or did he just disregard it as well? The Dwarves were created by one of the Valar, (just like the other races) and they were made short and stocky for a specific reason, and it most definitely was NOT so they could be laughed at by the other denizens of Middle-earth. It would not have been an issue to the other people of Middle-earth. In fact, they probably wouldn't take notice of it at all since that's just how they were created by the gods. The Dwarves accomplished great deeds in past battles against Melkor, and they even wore masks to strike fear into their opponents. They are a brave and noble race.

Again, it's as if Jackson didn't put any thought into it at all, falling back on the low-brow humor of slapstick and hijinks. Instead of being engrossed in the film, I was constantly ripped out of it by the jokes and found myself cringing and rolling my eyes. My suspension of disbelief can only go so far. Jackson really went overboard with the gags in The Hobbit (The Fellowship of the Ring is a far better film in my estimation, despite its silliness at times). Even the great humorist Woody Allen knew when to dial back the humor for the sake of the drama (Match Point, anybody?) Shame on you Jackson, for disrespecting Tolkien's work. Now we won't get another film based on the Middle-earth legendarium for 50 years. Jackson was not the man to direct or write these films. Is it just a coincidence that for the first time in history, a film won 13 academy awards (Return of the King) and was not even nominated for any acting awards? Why? because the writing was so bad; instead of being allowed to really act, the cast members had to tell jokes and be funny throughout their dialogue. At least the Amazon reviewer seems to agree with me, charging the film with engaging in ""tedious,"" cheap humor. It has bothered me to such an extent that I have looked into buying a film editing program and cutting out the intrusive gags, just like that guy did with The Phantom Edit in cutting out Jar Jar's scenes and making the movie more comprehensible overall. Does anybody know of a good program for that? J.R.R. Tolkien was an intellectual and classy writer. Yes this is a book for adolescents, but Tolkien wrote it with CLASS. He would never debase himself to make a joke of Radagast perpetually having bird poop running down the side of his face. Peter Jackson has no such scruples. He wallows in the lowest of low humor. And he can't resist that infelicitous mix of elevated English speech and vulgar modern idioms. What was the deal with the retarded looking dwarf with the sling-shot threatening to stick something up Smaug's jacksie?

I can hear the responses already: ""The film would be too serious without comic relief."" Well, I ask, was The Godfather too serious? Was The Exorcist too serious? Was Flight 93 too serious? Was Syriana too serious? Or did I just miss all the gags and jokes in those movies? Moreover, there is hardly any humor to be found in the Silmarillion, which is the central work for the whole legendarium. Another response will be that The Hobbit was written for children and so it MUST have a lot of comic relief. Ok, fine, I can understand that, But for goodness' sake Peter, use your brain a little and stop wallowing in the sandbox of low-brow humor. And let a REAL WRITER write the scripts. I believe that the Silmarillion can be filmed (perhaps in the style of something like Clash of the Titans), but if Jackson directs, he's got to hand over the writing duties to someone else.

I would also agree with others who have criticized the film for its overly-obvious CGI renderings. You'd think by now, that Weta would be able to make a character like Azog (and the goblin king for that matter) look much more realistic. I was rather shocked at how computer-y he looked.

The bright spot really is Martin Freeman. Although his lines are not always great, he does a fine job with the material he is given.

This is a bit of a digression, but I need to respond to those who think The Hobbit is far to short a book to warrant a trilogy of films. Remember that Jackson, in fact, is essentially working with three books: The Hobbit, The Book of Lost Tales, and Unfinished Tales, not to mention the extensive appendices at the end of LotR. He's got plenty of material to fill out three movies' worth.

Another digression. This is a minor complaint, but it has always gnawed at me that Gollum says his name in a hacking cough. Doesn't make much sense to me. The name was supposed to have resulted from the warbling sound he made in his throat. I'm not sure how you could get ""Gollum"" out of a coughing sound, or how Gollum can't help but say it when he coughs.

Well, that's my 3 cents anyway. And please remember people, this is just an opinion about ONE aspect of the films. If you like the films, humor and all, then I'm glad for you. I have no beef with anyone who has a differing opinion. I am aware that I speak for a minority of viewers, but I do hope those who find this review helpful would chime in with your own thoughts.",1362873600,12,7085,4.534010946051603

4639277,5,B0059XTU1S,"Wow this film was a great rather long adventure, but its only the beginning, ha!!! This film unlike what everyone else is saying is trully a work of art. This film is sadly under estimated. Everyone is really just angry because they had to sit through a 3 hour film, but hey my motto is the longer the film is the more money its worth. Unlike the ""Lord Of the Ring"" series this film can be easily understood by people (like me) who have not read the book. I understand this movie might be alittle to much for everyone to like but if you clear your thoughts and just think to yourself ""this is going to be the best"", then it will be the best, but if you don't go in open minded you are going to find everything wrong with the film. Now on to the actual reviewing, i only have good news to review to you all. The good stuff includes the acting, cast, visual effects, length, costumes, new frame rate, and much much more. Ok the acting is excellent i loved it, the spotlight is on Martin Freeman,Richard Armitage, and Andy Serkis. Martin Freeman plays our funny little hobbit man in this jorney out of the three he is the best i loved him and his acting skills in the film, he put lots of effert into this film and he did well just as in Sherlock he is great in acting, and even though Andy Serkis is only in the film for about 20 minutes he uses his time wishly to make an impression on the audience , and he succeeds very well he is the most memerable acting of the three, and finally Richard Armitage, who gives a very realistic proformance, sorta a sad, angry man with mixed emotions , he really expresses his charactors emotions. Don't get me wrong everyone elses acting was great too, but those three stood out the most to me. The cast was.. Super, Peter Jackson knows what he is doing when casting the actors, every actor matches the charactor's personalitly , which is often rare but Peter knows what he is doing. The dwarf's actors looked like they would as dwarfs and its just great casting. The visual effects are so great, they are so well detailed, i meanman Peter score two , you made the monsters look so real, it is just so cool ,the animation is beautifully done, they looked like they were worked on for close to a year, it was just Oh My God great like Life of Pi. It was really good visual effecst that look so real, and well detailed that it looks like they are really getting thrown , or coming after the dwarfs. I don't know why everyone is always so angry and hating Peter Jackson's length in his films, everyone hated that King Kong was 3 hours, but i didn't i just thought it was even better, that we'd be able to see more excellent film. This film needed the longer running time to give us enough to walk out of the theater feeling like oh my gosh i must see more, ad its true that how i felt. The costumes were like really cool and well detailed , they looked really old fashioned and neat, they just blended with the actors really well and fit with the time period . Most people hate the new frame rate, saying that it looks to really or the charactors move to fast, well you want to know what i say? I think it makes it look great and more clear and realistic looking (in a good way) i just loved it. Really i don't care how fast the charactors can pick up items i don't pay much attention to that, i mean does it really matter? All i know is that it works - well. The only other things i have to mention is the goblin king scene , and the dwarfs. I found the line the gobin king says stupid as well as him being so easy to defeat. He says""well i guess it is that easy"" when he takes a swing and Gandalf hits his head and then slits his belly like he was nothing but he was like huge. The other thing is they didn't spend any time really on developing the dwarfs, there are just to many, maybe if they had acouple die by the end then it would have been better but they didn't and that is not good. Well All an All The Hobbit was put in the hands of excellent people who knew what they were doing and actually cared about making this film a winner, (P.S i recommend seeing in theaters).

The parts I felt didn't work were those parts that are not in the book; like the continuing adventures of Azog; as well as the dwarves themselves, who were either too cartoonish (Balin) or too hero human-ish (Thorin).

4639283,4,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit has had a rather strange journey on it's way from book to the big screen. What was once a single movie was then split into two, and then finally three. The first in the trilogy, An Unexpected Journey, has finally been released on the public. but does it manage to capture the awe and excitement of the Lord of the Rings? Well, mostly, but not without it's fair share of faults.

 For those who don't know, The Hobbit follows the tale of Bilbo Baggins, and acts as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Bilbo in The Hobbit is not the one were used to. He's more or less the epitome of a normal hobbit, spending his days reading, eating, and smoking his pipe. And having no adventures. And this is how he likes it. That is until Gandolf shows up at his door, with a very unusual proposition. This is where the story really begins, that of the dwarves quest to reclaim The Lonely Mountain, and the finding of the one ring.

 Bilbo is easily the focus of the film, and rightly so (it is his story after all). Martin Freeman does an impeccable job at fleshing out a character that we didn't really know yet. He has just the right amount of wit without coming across as a fool, and manages to make Bilbo an immediately likable character. The rest of the cast mostly serve to give Bilbo someone to talk to, as they never feel very fleshed out. Gandalf is more or less the same as he ever was, but he doesn't ever really feel like Gandalf. There's so many scenes of him saving the company, that he starts to just become a plot device to get them out of whatever mess there in. The dwarves aren't much better, as there are so many of them that there simply isn't time to give them all a proper development. The one character that does manage to match (and maybe even surpass) Bilbo, is Gollum (played by the immaculate Andy Serkis). Gollum isn't just the husk of a lost hobbit, trying to reclaim the ring he so desires, he's so much more. Gollum was always somewhat creepy, but here he's downright terrifying, with his glowing eyes and the way he silently moves around the screen. It's an amazing creation of Serkis and CGI, that really strikes home just how dangerous Gollum is. It also manages something that the Lord of the Rings never could: it makes you feel sorry for him. Amiss the outbreaks and the twisted ramblings of his darker side, you can see what he used to be, and you feel sorry for him. It becomes plain just what the ring did to him, something that was never fulling got across in the other movies.

 Right from the start, The Hobbit is a much more lighthearted and funny movie than any of the three middle-earth films that came before it. There are songs, one liners, and plenty of deadpan humor from all the characters. This is a welcome change, and helps make the movie a lot more charming, but it's also where my first problem with The Hobbit is. It seems that the makers of The Hobbit didn't know what they wanted from it, and as such it goes back and forth between the lighthearted tale of a hobbit getting out of his comfort zone, and the epic battles of the previous trilogy. Early on the group is sitting around a fire, when talk turns to a battle of the past. The scene then switches to an image very reminiscent of the opening of A Fellowship of the Ring. The problem is that it just doesn't feel right with the rest of the film. The Hobbit isn't the same movie as it's predecessors, and when they try to make it that it doesn't work. This feeling of treading on the same ground is something that is with the Hobbit through to the end. Almost everything just feels like we've seen it before, be it the jumps in the mine or the visit to Rivendell, it just seems like a repeat. Some of this is do to the plot of the original story, but mostly it's the way it's presented. The music was also a bit of a let down. Sure, they have parts of the original soundtrack, but for the most part it's the same one piece being played in every scene, and that piece just isn't nearly as epic as Howard Shore's score for Lord of the Rings. Maybe it's unfair to be comparing it so much to it's predecessors, but it pays homage in so many ways to them that it only feels right to. There are several scenes interspersed throughout that, while never in the actual text, do a good job of linking the two trilogies. This is a welcome addition, but it does mean that the two should be judged against each other as they are very similar in the end. The ending is also a bit annoying. They do a good job of giving you closer, but the last few moments are so cliche that they really don't need to be there. It's a minor issue, but something I thought worth noting.

 Overall I enjoyed my time with Bilbo. There were some hickups and misteps, but it was still a good film. At it's best it manages to give middle earth a sense of humor and charm we haven't had before, and it fleshes out much of Bilbo's character and past more than the brief introduction he had in the other films ever could. At it's worst, it's trying to be something it shouldn't, by turning the Hobbit into a Lord of the Rings knock off. If the next two films can change this, then the Hobbit could sit beside Lord of the Rings as another blockbuster trilogy. As it is, it's a good film that any fan of Lord of the Rings is bound to like, though it's unlikely that those turned off by the other films will find anything more to enjoy here. It's good, not great, though always a good time.

It is a grandiose show that tries to emulate the accomplishment of the book. For some it succeeded, for some it did not. But in my opinion it failed to capture the modest charm of the book and at the same time undoubtedly was successful in separating a lot of people from $12.50 at the movie theater now and another $12.50 x 2 later.

When I had heard an actual film version of this great book (I'm not talking about the 1977 Rankin Bass cartoon)I would finally be done, I was ecstatic. If people truly consider the style of Peter Jackson's films, and how they tend to be drawn out and include many panoramic shots, you really can see The Hobbit is no different. HOWEVER, Jackson is extremely passionate about following the marvelous book (at least for now). He tied in the songs/poems perfectly, and the fact that he hints at Smaug but never really shows him, is genius. I do not believe the film had overacting; however the inclusion of Radagast was not necessary (since he is only referred to in The Hobbit, and has only a small part in The Fellowship of the Ring). Nor did I like how the ending was tainted with cheesiness; it was as if Jackson had stacked one of the best cakes and now the top was covered in cheese instead of icing. That being said I did feel that Jackson, given his style and the commonalities of his films, did The Hobbit justice. The soundtrack was faithful to the films, the acting (overall) was good, and I do feel like this it was (always will be) an unexpected pleasure when watching the films in the following films. Also, look at it this way; given the Rankin Bass cartoon, this is most likely the only real film trilogy that will do the book justice, so take it or leave it folks.",1362268800,8,1527,4.3426573426573425

The movie was amazing when seen in IMAX 3D with the high frame rate. The people whining about headaches from the FPS are incomprehensible; if you've played a video game in the last 10 years you've seen things at 60FPS which is way higher than this. Some old-fashioned folks just don't like change I suppose.

The substance was good, I'm not going to put any spoilers in here, but there are some scenes not in the books or scenes that have been rearranged. Some work but there are some that will have you rolling your eyes wondering why it was stuck in. For the most part I just loved the atmosphere of the movie because the cinematography and music were spectacular. It made me fall in love with Jackson's Middle Earth all over again and you may not remember, but it's almost been a decade since the last LOTR movie came out and I forgot how much I loved/missed it.

The key scenes of the movie are done perfectly and that's really what lets me forgive the rough edges.

Martin Freeman did a fantastic job with Bilbo and really shows the burgeoning maturity of the character. I also liked the portrayal of the dwarves in such a positive and proud way. In the previous movies, Gimli was used a bit too much as comic relief but this story shows Thorin as a proud and prickly character and this is his story as much as Bilbo's.

Overall 4/5 because there are things that could have been cut to make for a better movie, but otherwise it's good.",1362182400,4,1450,4.415730337078652

But thiry to forty-five minutes could have been left on the cutting room floor. The interminable chase scenes with the goblins both underground and later above ground could have been cut in half. Even the troll scene early in the movie was a bit long. I still think it is worth buying the DVD knowing you can fast forward through these parts.",1362182400,3,454,4.6875
4639302,5,B0059XTU1S,"I went to go see this movie at the midnight premiere, waiting all day for it. Ever since I heard that the Hobbit was coming to the big screen I have been so excited for this film to finally arrive. And boy was it worth the wait!!!

At first, Peter Jackson announced that the Hobbit would be spit into two films, An Unexpected Journey and There and Back Again. I thought this was all fine and dandy, and that the movies would be great. Then I heard that the Hobbit would be split into THREE films. Another trilogy! Really! We don't need another one of those! My main reason to say this was that I thought that there was not enough material in the Hobbit for three films to be done.

But then December 13, 11:59 pm arrived, and man oh man, did my opinion on Jacksons decision change! After watching the Hobbit, part 1, seeing how that first film was done, i believe that there is by far enough material to cover three movies. and then some, most likely!

My favorite parts about this film are, 1, Erebor. The Dwarf Kingdom Under the Mountain was superbly done. Absolutly fantastic to watch! Eyegasm! Moria from the Fellowship was amazing, but it was in ruins. Erebor was not, and boy do I admire Tolkiens Dwarves that much more! 2, the whole Goblin sequence. This includes Goblin Town, the Goblin King, and the Dwarves and Gandalfs flight from the creatures. That part was fantastically done. In the book it describes Goblin Town as a system of tunnels and caverns. In the movie it is really a massive cavern under the Misty Mountains, with alot of wooden bridges and such spanning it in a town-type of fashion. I thought that it brought out the Goblins even more then they themselves already did. And the Goblin King was great! Cant remember the actors name, I think its Barry something-or-other, but he did a superb job. Scrotum Beard! 3, The Troll Sequence. The Trolls were great, hands down to those actors. These trolls are very differend than the ones found in Rings (they do look similar to the troll we saw in Moria). Their dialogue was awesome, and when Gandalf turns them to stone, epic. 4, Gollum. One of the most unforgettable characters of Tolkiens universe. Andy Serkis, we love you! At first I didn't notice it, but after watching the Hobbit 4 times, I can see how Jackson made Gollum look just a little younger than when we see him in Rings. His acting is comedic, frightening, and very two sided. On the third time I saw it, I almost cried when Bilbo almost kills Gollum. That scene really shows, I think, how much Gollum is *addicted* to the ring. And 5, I loved the music. Great job Howard Shore!

To all those reviews out there, saying the pacing was too slow and such, I disagree. I think that shots of the groups journeying were just long enough to show what was needed. I cant think of any scenes I would cut down on, except that the warg chase scene before Rivendell was just a tad too long. Just a tad, mind you.

To Tolkien Purists, I count myself among you. I have read over Tolkiens works so many times, Im pretty sure I know Middle Earth and its stories and legends better than the back of my own hand. Movies will never be exactly true to the books, showing all audiences what they had envisioned in their own minds. Jackson cant please everybody you know. But aside from a few instances, this was pretty true to the book. The major storylines that were not were the whole Azog-Thorin ordeal, the Warg Chase, and Radagasts scenes.

Concerning the Azog-Thorin thing, I didn't not care for it. I thought that it was ultimatly a way to make the movie more exciting, especially at the wargs part at the end. Ida been fine if it wasn't in there, but im not complaining that it is. I think it adds to the movie, adds to the film-versions of Middle Earth. And, Azog was pretty beast.

The Warg Chase was cool, and likewise, it was for the audiences. My only problem with it is that the group leaves the forest behind, then two shots later, their out in a plain/rohan-type area. whered the forest go? and for that matter, what happened to Radagast? Obviously he escaped, but still.

And Radagast himself was done very well by Sylvester McCoy. The way Jackson had him introduce the Spiders, and the Dol-Guldur/White Council plotline, it made a great amount of sense. If he had done it the way it was in the books, it would have taken too long.

All in all, I think that The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey was fantastic, and really lived up to the bar that Rings set for it. It is a worthy addition to the Middle Earth film saga. My only problem, SHOW ME SMAUG!!!!!!!

The movie is a great lead up to Lord of the Rings, I just did not like the idea of the story being told in a flashback style, as one already knows Bilbo Baggins succeeded. The nice thing is you still get lost in the way the story is told and forget about the flashback temporarily. It just seems odd how Peter Jackson is putting so many characters in Lord the Rings into this series. I am guessing it is to have the fans of the show to stay familiar to them, but it is still unnecessary.

I had this pang in my gut fearing this would be something on the order of George Lucas restarting the ""Star Wars"" trilogy with the silly ""Phantom Menace"" in 1999. Fear assuaged for the most part.

This preamble begins when Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) decides to write the story of how he originally took possession of the infamous ring. His narration leads us back to his younger self (excellent Martin Freeman) who is inexplicably recruited by the wizard Gandalf (returning Ian McKellen). Their story is relatively simple. They are to help the 13 survivors of the dwarf kingdom, now led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in recapturing their mountain home held by a vicious dragon.

The movie is about their journey getting there. Naturally there are enemies in their way, real and imagined. Not the least of which is an army of orcs and their giant wolf-like steeds. Scary to look at, the orcs are easily picked off inside their secluded compound by the dwarfs. I couldn't figure that one out. The orcs also have the ability to find dwarfs using a keen sense of smell...well except when they climb up in a tree. Another head-scratcher.

Director, writer and head honcho of all things Tolkien, Jackson has the look down pat. Although I must admit, some of the backdrops looked a little too CGI. Perhaps the film had slowed to a point where I was just a bit too focused elsewhere. The film does seem to ponder at times. There is one scene when Bilbo falls down a jagged crevice in the orcs mountainous home (unscathed by the way) and first meets Gollum (the great Andy Serkis).

Sensing everyone has been waiting for Gollum to appear, Jackson lingers forever in this confrontation. Bilbo and Gollum go through several rounds of verbal riddles, slowing everything down. Was the 2 hour and 46 minute running time really necessary? I don't think so. Several characters from the ""Rings"" make brief appearances including Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Elijah Wood as Frodo. ""The Hobbit"" will likely please many and irate others. I'm reasonably satisfied but hope for better things to follow.

I originally watched this movie on an IMAX screen in 3D so didn't see the controversial faster speed film shown in standard theaters. As is usually the case the IMAX print looks great. The 3D isn't over done and has a natural look with plenty of depth.

The Blu ray has 2D or 3D options and a variety of packaging.  All come with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The visuals are excellent especially the 2D version.  The audio likewise is first rate.  The English language version has a great DTS-HD Master audio 7.1 option.  French, Spanish and Portuguese are Dolby Digital 5.1.",1362096000,,2833,4.761224489795918

4639309,4,B0059XTU1S,"It's been over a decade since The Fellowship of the Ring hit cinemas across the world, turning people who never gave fantasy (or three-hour movies) a second thought in to die-hard, Tolkien-lovers. Now, after years of studio politics and financial uncertainty, acclaimed director Peter Jackson has delivered the first part of a three-film adaption of J.R.R Tolkien's beloved (and significantly shorter) novel The Hobbit. The decision to turn the Hobbit into three movies, which came after principal photography was completed, was, and continues to be, a source of controversy among fans of both Jackson's films, and Tolkien's novels, but whether you have you reservations or not, we now have the first installment in theaters. So how does it hold up to the legacy of it's forebears?

  The answer: its complicated.

  Even though I didn't see The Hobbit in High Frame Rate 3D, the marks of a director who was shooting for this new format were very much present in the version that I viewed. It looks different, and a lot of times, its hard to say that that was a good thing. There were times where, because of the different style of lighting and the blocking of the scenes, I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie, and other times where the cinematography was reminiscent of that of a BBC miniseries.

  The pacing, too, was different than most other films. Faced with gleaning nearly nine-hours of footage from a 316-page novel, Jackson and the other writers were not only forced to make up new material, but also had to squeeze every second of footage that they could out of the book, and it shows; The Hobbit is paced like a book, not a movie. As such, it may come across as a little bit dull at times (even compared with the most drawn-out Sam and Frodo sections of The Return of the King) for those not already predisposed to being completely dedicated to the film.

  The Hobbit is also a very different kind of film than The Lord of the Rings movies were. It is not an epic, it is a very personal, character-driven story about finding your place in the world. The Lord of the Rings, was a fantasy in a world brimming with weird creatures and odd magic, but still somehow grounded in reality, it made sense in a if-there-really-was-a-world-like-this-this-is-how-it-would-function sort of way. The Hobbit's Middle Earth, on the other hand, is a whimsical and often childish place, and full of humor to the point where I would actually classify it as fantasy/adventure/comedy. This is not the same genre as The Lord of the Rings (and rightfully so, as novels were very different as well) and anyone going into the theater expecting the same experience will come away disappointed.

  Now a lot of what I've said sounds rather condemning, but there is another way to look at it. The Hobbit is an odd beast, filmed in a way we've never seen before, and written in a way that most movies aren't (and usually shouldn't be). But looking at the film as a whole, these things end up coming together to make a movie that is wholly unique, something that is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Yes, it won't have the mass appeal that The Lord of the Rings had, and in that sense, they were better movies, but Peter Jackson tried something different, and to a large extent, it pays off. The Hobbit does outmatch the previous films when it comes to the cast, who are all, especially the three leads, extraordinary.

  The Hobbit harkens back to the original kind of adventure story or fairy tale, disturbing and frightening at times, yet funny and harrowing at others. It is, in the end, a very good movie; lightning has struck for New Line again, but in a very different place. I wouldn't want every movie to be made like The Hobbit was, with odd cinematography and slightly off pacing, but in this circumstance, it seems to work, all coming together to create the kind of on-screen fantasy spectacle that Mr. Jackson alone seems capable of crafting.

8/10 (Very good)

-Edit: 3.3.13-
  After seeing the film in HFR I can definitely say that while it did provide many 'oooh, ahhh"" moments, it also provided a lot of moments that looked more at home on a 1990's BBC special or a soap opera. These moments pulled me out of the movie, and in my opinion, no amount of great moments can make up for even one that pulls the viewer out of the experience. That being said, the enjoyment of HFR will vary greatly on a viewer-to-viewer basis and I would encourage everyone to check it out on a second or third viewing of the movie (or on the upcoming sequels).

4639310,5,B0059XTU1S,"This movie was really wonderful and well done.  At first, I thought it would be simple and straightforward, just like the book, but I was so happy to see Jackson and Co. put in all the elements of the Tolkien world that were going on at the time Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves made this journey.  Before looking at bad reviews of how long the movie is, consider that Jackson isn't one for deviating from the books unless it is vital to do so.  In fact, there was not nearly as much deviation as folks think.  Tolkien actually wrote about most of the ""extras"" in Appendix A of Return of the King, as documents from Gimli, Gloin's son (Gloin who was actually part of Thorin's company of dwarves).  The necromancer was actually mentioned in The Hobbit, though it was not a main focus, and Gandalf did express worry about Sauron potentially using Smaug as a weapon against the forces of good.  What we tend to forget is that Tolkien spent years world building Middle Earth before he even wrote The Hobbit, and that there was considerably more going on than could fit into the initial book.  The Hobbit is written from Bilbo's perspective, and so we are limited to the world view of a simple, or not so simple, Hobbit.  Hence, we get the fast paced, delightful journey.  But if one delves deeper into the Tolkien realm, we discover the burden Thorin II Oakenshield actually bore, which was excellently portrayed by Richard Armitage, and we see that he is essentially set up as an emotional foil for Bilbo.  We see all the characters, dwarves, wizards, elves, and hobbits alike, grow and change within the confines of a few hours.  Jackson has provided the deeper human essence that Tolkien's light hearted tone alludes to.  This is not a flaw with Tolkien's style; in fact, if one reads the Poetic Edda and the Volsungs, Both of which were the basis for his Middle Earth, one can see the depth of Tolkien's works in ways which many modern readers may not be able to if unfamiliar with those centuries earlier works.

The movie brings back the magic of LOTR in a big way.

The addition of the prologue showing the arrival of the dragon is good, but on the whole it really is an endurance test.  Imagine if Jackson decided to film War And Peace or Gone With the Wind?

I was expecting a new musical score.  Thorin's character is in many ways similar to Aragorn.  And the good guy vs bad guy story (Thorin and the gray orc) is not very prevalent in the book but similar to the Aragorn/Sauron saga.  So in the end I felt disappointed.  Jackson's Hobbit movie is in many ways a repackaging of the very successful and good LOTR movies.,1362009600,6,506,4.329787234042553

4639320,3,B0059XTU1S,"Like most people reviewing Peter Jackson's version of Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' I saw it at the movie theatre (my first 3D movie) and overall I enjoyed it, but was left scratching my head.
One, why on earth does 'The Hobbit' need to be extended into three movies, when it could have easily been accomplished in one long epic. This is especially true if Peter Jackson gave more fidelity to the original book. The opening scene  involving Gandalf and the dwarves raiding Bilbo's house could have easily been shaved in half allowing more room for this tale to be concluded in one film.
Two, where on middle-earth did Radagast, the Brown Wizard, come from? He sure was not mentioned in Tolkien's original version of the Hobbit and was barely mentioned in the LOTR trilogy. Although I kind of enjoyed Radagast, especially his concern for the woods and animals of Mirkwood, his inclusion was a little distracting and invites inevitable comparisons with, dare I say it, Jar-Jar Binks from Star Wars. Obviously, his inclusion was to foreshadow Sauron's return in the LOTR series ( and theatrically tie all of the movies together) but on the whole he was a distraction.
Three, and most grievous was the added storyline of Thorin being hunted by the white Orc. There was no such white Orc and no such story line in the original Hobbit and its inclusion in Peter Jackson's version was inexcusable and, IMO, cheapened the movie. Seriously, the cliche of the main character ( or one of the main characters) being hunted by a menacing bad guy is so overdone I would have thought Peter Jackson was above using it, especially since the original Hobbit storyline has so much action already.
Finally, as much as I relish the idea of three new movies involving Tolkien books, other than a blatant cash grab, I see no reason why 'The Hobbit' needs to be carved into three separate movies (part one, this one, ended about 2/3 through the book). I would rather see Peter Jackson bring his considerable talents and resources for producing epics to bear on bringing the work of other classic authors, say Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness'  or 'The Call of Cthulhu' to the screen. I always pictured the ruins of the ancient alien Antarctic city in Lovecraft's ' At the Mountains of Madness' being handled by Jackson along the lines of Skull Island in his remake of King Kong.",1362009600,5,2355,4.755501222493888

4639327,4,B0059XTU1S,"The movie starts out slowly, in my opinion, with glimpses into Bilbos life the day of his birthday party in the Shire (the day he gives Frodo the ring) before flashing back some 60+ years to his first meeting with Gandalf and the chaos that followed. I thought the scenes of dwarven partying in Bilbos house were excessively drawn out (and maybe, I was cringingas most mothers doat the thought of the amount of cleaning up that had to follow.) If there was a relationship that Gandalf had with Bilbo prior to the escapade, it must have escaped me. It felt odd that Gandalf would shoehorn Bilbo (practically a stranger to him) into an adventure for which he was obviously unprepared and unwilling to undertake, unless there were some rumblings of fate or destiny.

Me, personally, I would have stayed home, but Bilbo dashes off to follow the dwarves and embarks on an unexpected adventure (heck, journey is too mild a term to describe all that follows.) The dwarves, led by Thorin, the dwarven prince, are intent on reclaiming their mountain home from a dragon. (If I were going to fight a dragon, I would have brought along way more than 13 people, just saying) The merry band runs into orcs, trolls, and a veritable gamut of Middle Earths flora and fauna (most especially the ones that are large enough and mean enough to kill you.) Through it all, one thing stuck out: Gandalf is unquestionably the personification of deus ex machina. The dwarves get into trouble with the trollsGandalf shows up. The dwarves get into trouble with the orcsGandalf shows up. The dwarves get into trouble with more orcsGandalf shows up.

It was enough to make you roll your eyes, but the action was rip-roaring fun anyway, so you could almost forgive the novelist and the script writer for it. The one thing I never understood about this movie (or about The Lord of the Rings) was why the giant eagles wouldnt just carry you to your destination and drop you off in front of it as opposed to dropping you off in the middle of nowhere and expecting you to walk the rest of the (long, long) way.

Bilbo acquits himself admirably. Over the course of the movie, he becomes less of a nuisance and much more of a hero, winning Thorins respect and gratitude. All in all, the stakes in the movie appear to be much less world-changing than The Lord of the Rings (though Im sure Thorin would disagree with me) but the undercurrents of change run through the entire movie, not the least of which, Bilbo finds the one Ring in Gollums cave.

As for the characters, the dwarves started to blend together. I recognized a few easily (Thorin, Balin, Fili, and Kili) but the rest were a blur of beards. There were elves, though not enough, and there was no Legolas (Sighfor that I think Ill deduct a half star.)

In hindsight, The Hobbit was a fun movie. It wasn't quite like The Fellowship of the Ring where my immediate instinct after the movie was to pay for another ticket and watch it again. In this case, I can hold off on my second viewing of The Hobbit until it comes out on DVD as a trilogy (because as we all know, boxed sets are cheaper), and even then, I suspect, I won't be as compulsive about seeing it again and again as I am with The Lord of the Rings. Yes, the movie is rife with fights with orcs and trolls, but taken as a whole, there is much less emotional tension and conflict in the story (or at least it seems a bit more trite compared to that in The Lord of the Rings.)

Id rate it 4.5 stars (minus a half star for not putting Orlando Bloom on the screen somewhere.)",1361318400,7,3554,4.46

4639329,5,B0059XTU1S,"It has been 17 years since I have read the book The Hobbit so to do a comparison to the book is next to impossible so I will go with what I have seen from the movie itself.  I saw the 3-D version, which is pretty good graphically, but I hate wearing glasses.  OK, onto the movie itself.  It started off as Bilbo narrating it to Frodo where he told the story of the dragon Smaug overthrowing the dwarven kingdom.  We even get to meet with Frodo at the beginning of the movie, likely the setting just before Frodo meets with Gandalf in the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring.  Once this introduction is done they take us right into the story of Bilbo 60 years prior.

The story actually takes a while to get going and is slower paced in the beginning than The Fellowship of the Ring, perhaps because they are trying to extend one book into 3 movies whereas the Lord of the Rings was 3 books into 3 movies.  However, it does seem that they use some good humor to keep us entertained. In the beginning  the dwarfs basically intrude Bilbos home driving him crazy.  Humor is spread throughout the movie, I would say in slightly more quantities than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

Once the movie gets going it gets pretty action packed.  We actually get to see cave trolls have conversations and other beasts of Middle Earth that were not in Lord of the Rings are presented here, some pretty big and nasty ones.  We also get to meet one other quirky wizard who rides a sled pulled with super fast bunnies.

If you liked the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you will like this even if you find the beginning slow at first.  Its a very different story (although Bilbos finding of the ring is told here) but it is still based in J. R. R. Tolkiens middle earth.  One of the meanings I derive from this story is that we all would like the simple life without challenges, but sometimes those challenges can come into our lives unexpectedly.  Sometimes it is better to face the challenge as Bilbo reluctantly did than to ignore the challenge.  The challenges we face in this life help to build character, which can have a positive effect on others around you, which was the case in the story of Bilbo.  I look forward to the second part of this Trilogy and am glad to see the return of having to look forward to a few Decembers of seeing some of the greatest fantasy movies ever.",1361145600,2,2364,4.334090909090909

I do not think that any of the nay sayers have read the same book - that or it has been a long time and they need to go back and read it again. The film does a great job of filling in holes for those who do not delve into the other works of Tolkien and do not go over the many, many notes. There is much to love here, and I cannot wait until Desolation of Smaug in December 2013. The movie truly feels like a homecoming for any LotR fan, and in that sense I am glad that The Hobbit was filmed afterwards.

4639335,4,B0059XTU1S,"Ever since ""The Lord of the Rings"" ended, fans have been clamoring for ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted as well.

Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first part of a trilogy of ""Hobbit"" movies. It has some few flaws, but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.

Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...

At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.

It took me two viewings of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd, and the second time I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.

Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of ""The Hobbit"" (plus chunks of ""Unfinished Tales"") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.

And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. It's brilliant.

He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.

However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.

But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.

And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast!

The comedy can be a bit grating, but ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.",1360713600,6,3936,5.047765793528505

4639341,4,B0059XTU1S,"After the successful ""King Kong"" and poorly received ""The Lovely Bones,"" Peter Jackson finally comes back to the world of J. R. R. Tolkien with ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga. It is safe to say his new film is visually impressive like the previous trilogy, but the film's deliberately paced story, especially its opening 40 minutes, will test the patience of some viewers.

""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first installment of the new trilogy, is about Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, Dr. Watson of UK crime drama ""Sherlock"") and his adventure with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen reprising the role he played in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and a group of dwarves to reclaim their land and treasures taken by the dragon Smaug. The film takes too much time introducing the characters, but once they set out on their journey, the story gets faster and better with lots of special effects-laden action sequences.

Some of the characters from the ""Lord of the Rings"" epic also appear in ""The Unexpected Journey,"" including Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Gollum (Andy Serkis), the latter with the Dark Lord Sauron's Ring that Bilbo gives Frodo in ""Fellowship of the Ring."" But you will notice the tone of ""The Hobbit"" is more light-hearted than that of the ""Lord of the Rings"" epic.

""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" if which story precedes that of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy by 60 years, is a journey to where we once visited about ten years ago. For better or for worse, ""The Hobbit"" has a feel of familiarity, and could have been better with more focus on the journey, but still it is engaging.",1360108800,2,1645,4.785211267605634
4639342,3,B0059XTU1S,"Here's Peter Jackson's long awaited follow up to the universally acclaimed Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the Hobbit, which is only one book, that's stretched out into the same amount of time. Why? Because f***ing $$$ that's why. But stretching it out adds a lot of problems, namely, filler. And adding in filler into a movie like this kills a lot of other things, the humor feels tacked on and forced, the action scenes are unnecessary and boring, and overall it's just a bad combination.

So obviously everyone involved is super passionate about making the Hobbit, which saves it in many aspects. You can just tell Ian Mckellen is glad to be in his wizard costume again, the dwarves put their all into their roles, and Martin Freeman plays a perfect Bilbo, showing his initial trepidation slowly transforms into full blown commitment to the mission. The huge budget also works, the scenery is gorgeous as always and if anything works better as a big 3 hour postcard from New Zealand.

But there are many problems to consider, the most obvious one was the aforementioned 'filler'. Many scenes just run on too long and feel like it's going nowhere, the most notable example is the troll scene. Before the actual part, we have to watch the 'suspense' of Bilbo lurking around their campfire, with Bilbo almost being caught by the trolls multiple times. All the while this is going on the trolls are talking like the three stooges with limey accents, and the whole time this scene was going on I just felt like Peter Jackson was saying ""we know this scene goes nowhere, but look at the funny trolls and the suspense!"" I felt neither except for my ass getting sore.

Another thing that annoyed me was when the wizards and elves got together on their big meeting. Some of the stuff they talked about was legit, like how Smaug is a major potential threat they should neutralize, but keep in mind, this is before Lord of the Rings, so how about we see a different side of their relationship? It was kinda cool seeing Gandalf and Galadriel meet, even though it seemed like they were sleeping around with each other. But then Saruman comes in, and he's the same prick we knew from Lord of the Rings. I mean I get that he'll become a villain, but can't we at least see some comradely between him and Gandalf? Instead he talks down to Gandalf, and Gandalf just rolls his eyes at Saruman. C'mon! They were friends! They warmly greeted each other in Fellowship, so showing a friendly side of Saruman would've been fine! In fact it could've showcased the great evil coming more, in that it corrupted their most powerful wizard! But noooo. That was a big missed opportunity in my opinion, if your going to show these characters again in a movie that doesn't focus around them, at least bring a new side to it.

Then there was the head dwarf, who was literally just Aragon 2.0. He is the same quiet stoic badass leader of the group, and he goes so far as to even give off the same Bambi eyes throughout the film. Many times you'll see him and it looks like he's about to cry or something, and all we saw of him in this film was either silently being a badass or looking like he's going to cry for no reason at all. The main scene where Aragon looks like he was about to cry was the scene where I looked like I was about to cry the first time I saw it, when him and Frodo understood they had to part ways, and in complete silence, Aragon tells Frodo that he would've followed him to the very end. Now that was a powerful scene, because the entire film built up to it with more than just Aragon thinking Frodo is a pussy. In fact the entire scene of the fellowship disbanding in the first movie was pure cinematic gold, powerful scenes which added depth to fantasy characters, something almost unheard of. But what do we have here? An albino goblin mocks the main characters' dad or something, much less of an impact there. Though the actor probably did all he could but he was written poorly and was probably the least interesting character in the film. The other dwarves don't have much personality to them, and just like the book, distinguishing them apart was challenging, however the make-up department does a good job of making them look different.

Another thing was how many big action sequences feel lifted out of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The warg chase in the open plains felt reminiscent of the Two Towers (they even retain scouts), the scene with them getting out of the mountain after being chased by a bunch of goblins felt like the Moria scene from Fellowship (I think they even have a scene where a few of the dwarves are stuck on an unsteady platform), and other would be the eagles saving everyone. I know some of this stuff was in the books, but it felt like I've seen it all before, and hopefully those are the last scenes reminiscent of Lord of the Rings scenes (I forgot the book, I read it like 10 years ago).

Then there was the scene where they're crossing the mountains and it turns into a giant mountains fight. From the books I thought they saw it at a distance or something, but here they're right on the rock giant's legs, I mean why? So we can have more action? That's the problem with this film, it never really feels like a world like Lord of the Rings did, because there's too much sporadic unnecessary action, and not enough time where the film calms down a bit and lets you soak Middle Earth in. Case in point is the pointless mountain giant fight where the dwarves are right in the middle of it.

Also the goblins seem much less threatening this time around, however that makes sense, because the Hobbit isn't as dark as Lord of the Rings, so I guess a cartoon King Goblin making silly jokes makes sense. I just remember how in Moria they looked like demons, and here they look like cartoon bad guys. The Riddles in the Dark scene was well done, and surprisingly they didn't drag that one out. The ending was sorta heartwarming, where the dwarves accept Bilbo, it was like now we were getting somewhere with the characters instead of seeing them fight all the time like video game characters.

Overall the Hobbit isn't a bad film, but it's also no where near the heights that Lord of the Rings were at, but as I stated, Lord of the Rings is more serious and heavier than the Hobbit. So if they embraced that this film is more kid friendly, instead of mixing it up with some darker LOTR prophecy stuff, and if they trimmed it down to just two 3 hour movies instead, and come out with an extended edition later, it would've been much better. But then again they would make 1/3rd less profit, so that won't happen. So at the end we have an enjoyable fantasy that feels a little bloated.",1360022400,,6704,4.466938775510204
4639343,5,B0059XTU1S,"I teach students the book ""The Hobbit' so I know it practically by heart. Eleven year olds have a strong identification with Bilbo, as you can imagine. I was a big fan of all the Lord of the Rings movies, so was very anxious to see this movie. I took the day off school to go to the premiere ! I got my big bag of popcorn and sat down to enjoy. And, enjoy I did. This movie is really good. It was easy to like the characters, feel for their motivations, and follow their journey to a homeland. I cried at one point, laughed at others and the three hours passed so fast I was sad when it ended. I hope to use the DVD in teaching (I currently use the old cartoon, the music in that is truly wonderful) as it will give good visuals to accompany the book. I even laminated my popcorn bag with the pictures of Bilbo and Gandalf to put over my Middle Earth tapestry map in the classroom. Put me down for notification when the DVD comes out, and I will pop out of the Shire to buy it.",1359763200,8,977,3.989795918367347

But Peter Jackson and the cast and crew have outdone themselves (again!) - I was spellbound, mesmerized, and delighted by the first film and can't wait to see the others.  Martin Freeman is the perfect Bilbo, and he made me laugh so many times.  Andy Serkis' Gollum was right on, as well as Ian McKellen as the magnificent Gandalf.  And Richard Armitage as Thorin - he literally took my breath away, I almost fell out of the chair when he came on the screen.  Besides being the handsomest dwarf you could possibly imagine, he got inside the character and made Thorin come alive - he is an amazing actor.  The troop of dwarves were also amazing, very individual characters.  Beyond the cast, the music was fantastic, the New Zealand landscape truly spectacular, and the CGI incredible - and I'm running out of superlatives, so I'd better stop.  Just want to add that I've seen the movie 5 times and I'll probably see it a couple more times and I can't wait to get the DVD so I can see it again at home - don't miss it!",1359590400,5,1167,4.446009389671362

My only complaint is that these films wouldv'e been perfect as two parts instead of a trilogy. It did drag a bit but only a few parts. One good thing about this being a trilogy though, their covering extra things the book didn't quite go into explanation on, so that's a definite plus. It was nice to finally see Radagast on screen too, always been curious about him. Looking forward to the other films though, because I feel they'll be alot better.

The story is simple and follows along, like the book. There are a few bits in the film that are off from the book, but they mostly work well with the overall theme. The underlying theme is of course trusting Bilbo and knowing just how useful he really is. I overall love Andy's return as Gollum, though I think it was taken a little too comedic. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is great performance as it was in Lord of the Rings. Martin Freeman as Bilbo was a really good choice, he nailed it! I am looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug and to see the mighty dragon himself! The film is overall faithful to the book and a really good film.

4639347,4,B0059XTU1S,"I went to see this movie over the New Years Eve week. I didn't want to wait in line for the 3d version, so I went to a regular viewing. The very beginning of the movie I felt like I was watching an out of focus movie. Someone told me later it was just my eyes adjusting to the way it was shot by the filmmakers, but it really bugged me.  I hope the DVD when it comes corrects this because I don't own a blue ray or 3D dvd player.
As for the movie, LOR is one of my all time favorite triology movies. I've read all the books, plowed through The Silimarillion and The Children of Hurin and everything else written by Tolkein including the awful Christmas book.  But the Hobbit is a fave of mine and I like what they did with the story when they made the movie.  Is it exact? No, but it is true to the nature of the book, the thread that runs through all the books and it's a little nice I must admit, to be surprised by the changes in the storyline. Nothing like imagination!!!

I am very excited for movies 2 & 3, and PLEASE Mr. Jackson, I'd love to see my name in the credits again along with the rest of those who are the Fan Club members.  It was nice surprise to see us all listed in the credits at the end of the first 3 LOR movies!!!",1359417600,2,1238,3.936
4639348,2,B0059XTU1S,"First, let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all first-rate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books.  Unfortunately, The Hobbit is not, because it does not.  It really is a bad movie by design.  Choices were made to add slapstick comedy at virtually every opportunity, to fabricate added story lines which bloat, rather than add, to the story, and quite simply to stray from the book liberally to appeal to a young demographic.  The choice to do so is curious given the overwhelming success (commercial and critical) of the LOTR formula of being faithful to the books.

Too often scenes from the book have been altered to please young audiences with slapstick/gore/action or fabricated entirely.  Radagast, for example, who was mentioned in name only in the book, appears in the movie as something of an idiot wizard riding a sleigh powered by eight tiny... bunnies.  I'm not kidding.  This is perhaps the worst example of how Peter Jackson has botched the story and put the LOTR movie franchise at risk of ruin, presumably to appeal to a younger crowd, stretch it into 3 movies, and make more money.  There are many other example of this, which  cause you to leave Tolkien's world and wonder why the story was cheapened and botched at the hands of a director who did so well with the LOTR trilogy.

I didn't mind fleshing out the 'necromancer' story line that was only hinted at in the book.  But on the other hand I thought the 'unexpected party' scene, the troll scene and the 'riddles in the dark' scene and the 'out of the frying pan...' scenes- the best scenes in the first part of the book- were all disappointing, having been altered for the worse.  The Azog vs. Thorin story line, a fabrication bloating the movie to add some gore/action and give Thorin a nemesis to overcome, was also uncompelling.  I didn't care for the replacement of the goblin tunnels in the book with essentially the orc pits under Isengard, or having the dwarves fall through a trap door and down a long fanciful shoot to the goblin pits rather than have the goblins emerge through a crack in the cave, as was the case in the book.  The battle scenes thereafter are almost entirely slapstick gore, with a mixture of characters falling hundreds of feet onto rocks completely unscathed.

Lastly, I don't like how they changed the character of Bilbo Baggins.  In the book, Bilbo (and the dwarves for that matter) are basically out-matched and scared when the meet up with each of the foes in the first part of the book.  Bilbo, after reluctantly joining the group, is basically scared and miserable the whole first part of the book.  In the movie, Bilbo is portrayed more as a home-body who'd just rather be at home, but not terribly scared of trolls or orcs or goblins or dragons, they're just not really his cup of tea.  And the somewhat fabricated theme toward the end of Bilbo deciding to help the dwarves 'find their home' and help them get their home back is another disappointing alteration.

There are many smaller details of the movie that also work to cheapen it, but I think you get the picture.  The only reason for 2-stars instead of 1-star is the production values, which are as good as the original LOTR trilogy.  The movie is nominated for a makeup and production design Academy Awards, but a telling comparison with the LOTR trilogy is the absence of any nominations for writing or direction or picture.  Both 'Fellowship' & 'Return' won best adapted screenplay, and were nominated for Best Picture ('Return' won).  The Hobbit could be nominated for worst-adapted screenplay- and seems was a conscious, if incredibly poor, choice by the writers and director- who did so well adapting LOTR to the screen.

Equally disappointing is what might have been.  Instead of adding superfluous story lines, they could have made The Hobbit much smaller in scale compared to LOTR (which it is) and more personal.  Instead of starting with a Bilbo that is something of a home-body and not into adventures, they could have started with a Bilbo who secretly always wanted to go on an adventure- but was too afraid and too conforming to society to do so- until Gandalf pushed him along (in the book Bilbo was always into maps, etc. which is meant to suggest this).  From there, they could have portrayed the company of dwarves as serious and determined in their purpose, but totally unprepared for, and unknowing of, the challenges that awaited them.  There could have also been some focus on how miserable Bilbo was in the conditions- the mud, no food, and longing for home- and the friction and disrespect for him by most of the dwarves.  They might have also included how the elves made fun of them when they arrived in Rivendell, and Gandalf's own disdain for many of their failings, and that their adventure isn't his main concern.  Adding a troll scene that was true to the book, this would take about 50 minutes of compelling movie time as Act I.

Act II could have started with the company entering the mountains and the cave scene.  Instead of having them fall hundreds of feet unscathed through a trap door unscathed, followed by an hour of slapstick gore battle sequences, they could have had the goblins catch them in the cave, and bring them chained through the tight confines of the dark tunnels in the book, rather than the expansive open pits in the movie.  Being faithful to the book in this case would have led to more suspense and terror- like when the Black Riders first appeared in 'Fellowship'- rather than the slapstick battle scenes that actually took place.  That would have set the stage for Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, and a more tense, drawn-out riddle scene where Bilbo is more at risk and Gollum in control.  After a tense escape scene through the dark, confined tunnels, and the relief at finally getting outside- once again finding themselves out-matched by the goblins and wargs as they find themselves trapped a top burning pine trees (as in the book), only to be saved once again- this time by the eagles.  This would put the movie time up to around 110 minutes, instead of nearly 3 hours, and get the movie to the same place in the book.  Expanding the 'necromancer' story line (which I thought was a worthwhile link to LOTR) might add some time and make it about a 2 hour movie, with still plenty of plot for an additional 2 hour finale.

As it was, I came away thinking of a line that Gandalf used after recounting the story of Bullroarer Took to Bilbo early in the movie, and how he heaved off a goblin's head and it went 100 yards into a rabbit hole, winning the battle and inventing the game of golf at the same time.  When Bilbo replied ""you made that up"" Gandalf replied, ""all good stories have some embellishments.""  Perhaps this line served as a bad excuse for what was to follow.  The Hobbit already was a good fantasy story, as time has proven.  It didn't need embellishments.  Especially of the slapstick comedy variety that cheapen the story to appeal to 12 year olds.  It's too bad Peter Jackson couldn't leave well enough alone- to the ruin of the LOTR movie franchise.  I can't say I care to see this movie again, nor buy the disc, nor I am eagerly awaiting the next sequel if it is a botched as this one.  I hope Peter Jackson & Co. will do some serious re-work to their concept of The Hobbit, including re-shooting and re-editing many scenes in this film.",1359072000,15,7413,4.640122511485452
4639349,4,B0059XTU1S,"There was once a beloved trilogy. One day, its creator decided a series of prequels were in order, so he directed...Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. Thus was born mankind's apprehension and speculation over prequel trilogies. A case is yet to be made for why Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit requires three parts. Nonetheless, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good film...whew, what a relief!

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes place sixty years before Frodo takes his first step towards Mordor. The story is simple this time around, as we return to Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is persuaded, or rather coerced, by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to assist a party of 13 dwarves in their quest to reclaim their lost kingdom. Freeman is very effective as the neurotic, Woody Allen-esque, Bilbo. His nuanced touch to the role gives the audience a very likable and enjoyable central character arch that is only accentuated by our familiarity with him from Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings films. McKellen slips seamlessly back into his gray robes as Gandalf. While Gandalf is always wise and sensible, McKellen portrays him here as slightly less ""urgent"" given the lessened threat to Middle Earth and existence that occurs in The Hobbit. This lack of urgency translates to the entire film, which may disappoint die-hard Rings fans. There are more scenes in the ""silly"" category here than in the previous trilogy. Additionally, there is simply a lowered sense of critical doom and immediacy in this storyline. The film's opening scenes go on for quite a while and while enjoyable, the end result is a slightly bloated film.

These criticisms are certainly legitimate, but they are truly its only faults. The film looks beautiful and lives up to what one would expect from Jackson's take on the Tolkien mythology; New Zealand should probably be nominated for best supporting actor. The adaptation of Tolkien's book is developed in such a way that it will lead up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy very nicely. Familiar characters appear along the way, and they are not unnecessary or false. All of them further the story and add something to the film, which is a credit to the host of screenwriters including Guillermo del Toro and Jackson himself. Furthermore, the dwarf plotline is elevated from the childish mood reflected in the novel to one that feels a bit more mature. This is a good decision and while younger kids can enjoy this film (if they have a long attention span), it is clear that the Hobbit films look to maintain a similar tone to the previous films in the series. At the end, there is quite a bit to like about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. While it lacks the epic quality and complex narrative of The Lord of the Rings films, the groundwork is set for an excellent companion trilogy that is fun, technically impressive, and brilliantly respectful to fans and film lovers.

4639353,2,B0059XTU1S,"I write this review with some sorrow.  The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) movie trilogy ranks among my all-time favorite movies and I had been eagerly awaiting the premier of The Hobbit ever since I heard that Peter Jackson (the director of the LOTR trilogy) would be directing The Hobbit.  What a let down!  It seems as if Peter Jackson is trying to force LOTR fans to buy 3 tickets instead of 1 or 2, and did this through unnecessary inflation of what should not have been a lengthy epic movie.

Before I begin bashing the movie, I have to admit that it is not trivial to turn The Hobbit book into a movie.  The book ""The Hobbit"" appeared 17 years before the LOTR trilogy, and ""The Hobbit"" is not consistent with the LOTR trilogy in either content or tone.  This makes it impossible to be faithful to ""The Hobbit"" while maintaining some consistency with the LOTR.  For example:

* In the written Hobbit, the One Ring is just a magic ring that makes someone invisible.  There was no indication of anything sinister about it until ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""

* In the written Hobbit, Elrond was an elf, and a friend of Gandalf.  He let Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves stay at his house shortly after they escaped from the trolls.  There was no indication that he was king of Rivendell and a ""really serious person"" until ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""

* The tone of the written Hobbit is that of a fairy tale, whereas the LOTR is a serious set of books about a world in deadly peril.  Similarly, the Gandalf of ""The Hobbit"" is a silly, comical wizard, unlike the dignified, serious, and philosophical Gandalf of the LOTR.

Based on ""An Unexpected Journey,"" it appears that Peter Jackson is trying to manipulate the facts of ""The Hobbit"" to make them consistent with the LOTR trilogy, while moving the tone of ""The Hobbit"" about halfway from that of the book and that of the LOTR trilogy.  This is not an easy feat.

Attempts to quantify the bloat.  I own the extra-long DVD version of the LOTR trilogy and I just love it.  It is 11.3 hours long, and it omitted a major sub-plot from the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring book (the journey through the haunted forest on the way to Bree, and the encounter with Tom Bombadil) and a major sub-plot from the second half of The Return of the King book (Saruman in the Shire).  Including the second omission would have required changes to the beginning of The Return of the King movie, to let Saruman live.  Had these two sub-plots been included in the extra-long DVD movie trilogy, the resulting length would probably have been about 12.5 hours.

Now, let us start with the written source material.  The Hobbit book is between 25% and 30% as long as the LOTR book trilogy.  Multiplying 0.3 x 12.5 hours gives us 3.75 hours as the length for a Hobbit movie that covers all of the source material with the same thoroughness as the notional double extra-long LOTR DVD.  The Hobbit book does leave some gaps that could reasonably be filled in.  For example, Gandalf leaves Bilbo and the dwarves slightly over a third of the way through the book, with virtually no explanation.  He returns at the very end of the book, and indicates that he had an adventure of his own, which he describes in less than a page.  It might be reasonable to explain Gandalf's departure and cover his adventure, instead of focusing purely on Bilbo.  Doing these things could increase the maximum length of a non-bloated movie to about five hours - two movies of 2.5 hours each.  Unfortunately, the first of three Hobbit movies is almost three hours long, thus implying a total length of nearly 9 hours.

Another reasonable comparison would be with the Harry Potter books and movies.  Each of the seven Harry Potter books is longer than The Hobbit, but each of the first six books equated to one movie of less than 3 hours in length.  The final Harry Potter book translated into two movies with a combined length of about 4.5 hours.

Description of the bloat.  The movie contains lots of bloated scenes plus unnecessary scenes.  I could go on at great length, but discussing the first hour captures most of the problems.  The movie begins with a brief scene of an elderly Bilbo describing his great adventure to an unseen Frodo.  This is OK and provides continuity with the LOTR movie trilogy.  The movie then shifts to a roughly ten-minute depiction of a dragon taking over the mountain home of the dwarves.  This scene is completely unnecessary and corresponds to a fraction of a page in the book, when the dwarves told Bilbo that a dragon had evicted them from their home.  The movie then shifts back to a scene with Bilbo and Frodo talking the day before Bilbo's birthday party at the beginning of the LOTR.  This scene could have been combined with the opening scene, and shortened.  The movie then shows the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarves at Bilbo's home.  The movie turns a few pages in the book into a plodding 30+ minutes of meaningless blather.  This whole scene could have been done well in 15 minutes.  This pattern repeats itself throughout the movie.  In particular, every action sequence in the book gets drawn out interminably in the movie, with the number of implausible escapes multiplied by a factor of five or more.  Moreover, the movie adds two unnecessary and extraneous sub-plots not present in the book:  the entire interlude with the wizard Radagast, and the battle with the orcs just before Bilbo et al reach Rivendell.  Ugh!

It may still be possible to rescue the second and third movies.  Jackson needs to do whatever it takes to get movies two and three down to less than two hours each.  Most of this can probably be done by tighter editing of things already filmed.  In some cases, however, it may be impossible to get a bloated ten-minute scene down to a crisp five-minute scene by better editing of material already filmed.  In these cases, it would be necessary to re-shoot some scenes, assuming that the relevant actors are still available.",1358726400,13,6000,4.598870056497175
4639354,2,B0059XTU1S,"Where do I start? I laughed how stupid some of the Dwarfs looked, absolutely ridiculous, not all of them, but most. The goblins looked very similar to the Orks accept they were smaller, but the Goblin king, he was big as a Troll, I don't understand why they made him so much more bigger than the rest of his own kind, a Goblin (in my opinion) should look green and reptilian. Peter Jackson could have separated the difference between Orks and Goblins better. The Trolls looked good, they looked like what a Troll should. With that aside, here's huge problem with this film, there is 13 Dwarfs 1 Hobbit and a Wizard, they fight which seems to be hundreds of Goblins, and not one gets killed or seriously injured, then the bridge their on collapses and falls into a underground canyon, the fall is some where around seven seconds, maybe ten, this would be between 1000 and 1600 foot drop, no one could have survived this and then the Goblin King falls on top them after they hit bottom and he's bigger than all them combined, he's probably weighs over a ton. Then they climb out from under the rabble of the bridge, which the Goblin king lies dead on top, dust themselves off and run for it. No injures, no one dead (I 'm boggled as to why the goblin King fell right on top of them, he fell from a bridge like 10 minutes before they fell) this is completely idiotic, I know this kind of movie is made for children, then maybe it's not, I know this is a swords and sorcery film, a fantasy movie with dragons and wizards, but there has to be a hint of believability, no would survive a 1400 foot fall, not even King Kong. A group of 15 is out numbered by at least 30 goblins to 1 and they virtually walk away unscathed. This is what I mean by believability. The ork leader and his brood were basically the main antagonists, the leader looked stupid and there was little known about him, I don't think production gave him much thought, maybe they did, if they did, they screwed his character up, I didn't really feel any thing for this villain, (like...dislike) nothing. Actually I thought he's was pathetic, by meaning, you let a midget chop off your arm, you're at least 7 time bigger than he is, what you should do is step on him and squash him like a bug. The way the ork leader looked reminds me of the the villain in the second Hulk movie, the Abomination, it looked as if the producers couldn't settle on how he should have looked, and they botched him, same here. (I'm not saying the ork leader looked like the Abomination, just saying how they handled him) This movie was long and it felt long, just like Cloud Atlas. The acting was over all OK, accept for Ian McKellen, he looked as if he was there just for the paycheck. He probably thought to himself "" God this movie's silly beyond belief"". Personally I like sword and sorcery/super hero/science fiction flicks, I just don't like bad movies, this movie not a rotten egg, but it's close.",1358467200,6,2944,4.4036697247706424
4639355,2,B0059XTU1S,"The Lord of the Rings was three books.  So, they made three movies.  Ok.  The Hobbit was one book, so they made three movies?  Not ok.

The movie I saw was good enough.  It was an enjoyable enough of a thing to see.  But, as a Hobbit fan (since the 5th grade), it was very frustrating to see all of the extra unnecessary stuff they put into the movie.  It reminded me a little of when I went to Universal studios and rode on a few of their rides.  I had to wait a long time to get onto the ride.  The ride itself lasted just a few minutes.  Then, when the ride was done, they dumped you right at the entrance of a gift shop that sold products about the ride that you were just on...all over priced and all marketed to you as intensely as anything in the history of man has ever been marketed.

That's when you realize one thing...the entire experience you've just had, had very little to do with entertaining you.  90% of the experience you've just had was about getting you to spend more money (on top of the money you have already spent).

When you realize that... When you realize that the bulk of the experience you've just had was more about getting you to take more money out of your pocket and less about entertaining you...several things happen.

A) You feel like a target.  You don't feel safe.
B) You feel like protecting yourself from the people who are providing you the entertainment.
C) Whatever entertainment you did experience becomes less.

It kind of reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons.  When I was a kid, we'd sit there and watch the Looney Tunes and laugh our heads off.  Then, through a completely different source of information, you'd read about a comic book featuring the Looney Tunes.  Some, would buy the book.  Others didn't.  The people who sold the cartoons made money from advertisers...and that was ok.  Sitting through some commercials was fine.  It was the price you had to pay in order to get the entertainment.

Today though, the Saturday morning cartoons are nothing but advertising.  Everything about them is advertising.  And all of the gadgets, dolls and etc. are marketed, not only within the commercials, but also within the show itself (product placement)...etc.

That's when you realize it.  The people who make these shows aren't doing something that everyone else who has a job has to do...  They aren't providing a service.

Cooks cook.  Teachers teach.  Bus drivers drive buses.  Plumbers plum.  (Sorry, bad joke.)

But what are these people doing?  After you give them money, what service are they providing to you?  If 90% of their effort is to get you to give them more money, then what you are getting for your money is another request for money.  That's the service they provide.  That's the service you are paying for.  You give money.  They ask for more.

It's very frustrating and makes me not feel safe.",1358380800,7,2864,4.566074950690335
4639356,1,B0059XTU1S,"Confession: I was and remain a HUGE fan of the original ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but ""The Hobbit"" effort is TRULY APPALLING!

This movie so constantly suffers from the inability to decide just which age-group it's being pitched at.
The humour(?) is kid's stuff, but it's also quite violent and frightening in parts.
Despite this apparently incompatible miss-mash, what TRULY astounded me was the ""silly"" slapstick approach adopted throughout.
The beginning scene, which is allowed to drag on interminably, is truly like a BAD pantomime.
The repetitive comical facial muggings and stock theatrical poses from everybody had me expecting to have to shout out ""He's behind you!"", ...or even ""OH yes you are!""
I kid you not, it's literally Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, ...except in this case there's thirteen of the overly made-up little buggers.

After what seemed like an hour of falling over, knocking into each other juggling dishes,(boom-tish),and more eye-rolling and mugging at the camera, Buttons and Widow Twanky...., sorry, Bilbo and the group set off and you FINALLY think the story might be underway.

But no, ...then there's another over-extended sequence with three grotesque ogres or some such having a barbecue and discussing how to eat the adventurers. This is an opportunity to do even more Three Stooge type comedy with blows being exchanged, eyes being poked, guts being punched, burps, farts, arse-scratching and other gross-out humour. It holds up the movie for at least another hour or so. Who the hell was this aimed at? Even kids would tire of it before ten minutes was up.
Editing seems to have been the first casualty to ensure length!
The movie is SO obviously ""padded"" to increase the duration of this seemingly interminable piece so a trilogy can be squeezed out of the original very slim volume.

The 3D is also wanked shamelessly.
Remember early 3D when everything long and pointy was aimed directly towards the camera to amaze us with the capabilities of this new innovation?
Well here we have HUGE depths at every possible moment, and crossed by fragile bridges that fall down in ways most contrary to the laws of physics, ...precariously narrow paths wind along precipitous cliffs again plunging into bottomless crevasses, (off which people ALMOST fall so constantly of course),.....huge boulders and rocks raining from above in massive showers, (that miss everyone of course. Absolutely NO opportunity to over-use the capabilities of 3D is passed up here folks!

Is it a ""kid's movie"", ...or is there something for the adult therein?
If there was anything for the over nines, then I'm very much afraid I completely missed it.
I had such high hopes for this, considering the prior efforts regarding sets, costumes, direction, cinematography etc.
I was NOT in any way expecting to see ""Indiana Jones and the Hobbits do Panto"".
Yes, there's even a spherical boulder that comes rolling down the path, just like in Indiana!

I kept thinking this movie would at some stage manage to at least make some pale imitation of its worthy predecessors, but it just doesn't. EVER!!!
Kate Blanchett mopes and moons around briefly, playing Galadriel as if she is on an intense lithium treatment plus anti-depressants, looking totally doped to the gills rather than anything ethereal. Her comatose monotonal voice is something from the crypt!

Ian McKellar is perhaps the one saving grace of this whole shemozzle, ...but he so often just disappears off somewhere, only to re-appear at the last possible minute to be used as a deus-ex-machina to save-the-day when the hobbits are in trouble. Not once mind you, but several times!
And if he is indeed a wizard, ...and he demonstrates a few times that he certainly is, ...then why is he SO reluctant to use his powers when they are so very much in need? (Like being under forcible attack by a mob of ugly great Orcs riding the CGI equivalents of the Hound of the Baskervilles?)

The whole movie is trite, simplistic, truly corny, and an insult to Tolkien. However what it is most of all is FAR TOO LONG, and it does serious and probably irreparable damage to the impressive franchise that's gone before.

See it ONLY if you like the slap-stick carry on of Christmas panto, ....can endure dizzying 3D CGI as the driving force over very little narrative, .....and can sit still for the VERY lengthy time this over-long, over-blown self-indulgent piece of crap takes to play out.
Where the hell was the editing? Was there indeed any done at all, ...or was this just dispensed with to ensure there was enough footage to make three movies?

If I could give NO STARS for this execrable effort I would. Bitterly disappointing all round, ...and to think there are two more to go?
What a cynical grab for money.",1358294400,34,4770,4.929016189290162
4639357,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let me begin by saying I'm the type who is always a little wary of book-to-film adaptions. But, having said that, I always try to put aside any preconceived notions or prejudices I have before I enter the theaters, though sometimes I admit it is difficult, particularly when I am viewing something I enjoyed as much as LotR.

I must admit I was a little more wary of ""The Hobbit"" than usual. I was very excited for the original LotR trilogy, and was wowed by the film adaption of ""Fellowship."" But being so impressed by the first one made the hack job PJ did on ""Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"" even more of a disappointment, so I couldn't help but think of that when I went into ""Hobbit"" the first time.

I read the LotR trilogy when I was in my mid to late teens, thus the story was still quite fresh in my mind when I saw those films. I read ""The Hobbit"" when I was around eight to ten years old, and it scared me into more than one nearly sleepless night. However, even at that age, I could sense the potential in ""Hobbit,"" and how it nearly slipped out of Tolkien's control more than once (something which made sense after I read LotR nearly a decade later). I thought about reading ""Hobbit"" again before I went to see the film, but I decided the book had made such an impression on me as a child, and I didn't want to have it fresh in my mind making even more of a muddle of my feelings of ""Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.""

In the end, I'm glad I didn't. People have made a big deal out of PJ breaking ""Hobbit"" into a trilogy, as he did with LotR. I, personally, see a lot of potential in this. There were a lot of things hinted at and lightly touched upon in ""Hobbit"" that were important to the storyline but ultimately left unexplored, such as Thorin's past with the Pale Orc. Having the opportunity to explore these lightly touched upon things - as long as it is done carefully and in a way that compliments instead of detracts from the storyline - makes me think PJ did the wise thing in breaking ""Hobbit"" into three films as well.

As always, the locations used for the filming of ""Hobbit"" were characters in and of themselves. Looking at the beautiful scenery and lush colors make it clear why NZ is a popular place for filming movies and television shows of a more fantastical persuasion. As for the actors (and actresses) themselves, they all did a splendid job, with a few breakaways. Gandalf, as always, was a pleasure to watch. Bilbo was a pleasant surprise, with just the right touch of sweet innocence and underlying courage in just the right places in the film. The brothers Fili and Kili were very nearly show-stealers, completely making every single scene in which they appeared. Thorin was an excellent strong but flawed leader, and his actor did a wonderful job balancing the opposing forces of Thorin's personality, never letting one or the other overpower his performance. The interactions among the dwarves, and their individual and group interactions with Bilbo, were nicely done and allowed us a glimpse into the formations of bonds which last a lifetime and beyond among friends.

The pacing was very good. Things kept moving along, pausing to elaborate on some things without bogging down the story. The battle scenes, while at times unrealistic (getting smashed by a huge rock and coming out unscathed seemed a tad iffy to me, but it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment), were handled beautifully. A lot of people have mentioned PJ relied on CGI a little too much, but I think in something like this, he about has to or everything looks a little too fake. While there were a few obvious goofs - such as swords which were supposed to be glowing were as cold and dark as if there were no goblins or orcs around, when the weilder was in fact surrounded by them - they did not really detract from the overall enjoyment of the scenes and the movie.

Perhaps the best thing in ""Hobbit"" was Howard Shore's music. Even though my opinion of LotR films in general isn't really that favorable, I have spent many pleasurable hours listening to the music of the films. ""Hobbit"" was a nice blend of the familiar and the entirely new, again keeping the balance well without feeling like we were rehashing something which has already been done a thousand times. The inclusion of songs actually taken from the book was very exciting as well, considering LotR did an abysmal job on that count, only including one or two. From the moment I heard ""Misty Mountains"" in the first trailer I saw, I knew if nothing else ""Hobbit"" would not disappoint with the music, and I was right. The score is a perfect compliment to everything happening on screen, as well as doing a good job standing on its own.

As soon as I finished watching ""Hobbit"" the first time, I wanted to go back and see it again, and thankfully had the opportunity to do so before it left theaters. I hope it doesn't take long to release on DVD, because this film is definitely worth adding to any movie lover's collection, and most particularly to LotR fans.

Whether PJ can hold on to this tenuous balance remains to be seen - after doing such a good job on ""Fellowship,"" after all, he blew it big time with ""Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"" - but I have a good feeling he'll be able to keep the next two installments of ""The Hobbit"" as enjoyable and canonically-complimentary as he did the first.

This is an adventure I definitely look forward to reliving again and again!",1358294400,4,5464,4.505549949545913
4639358,5,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson and his crew in New Zealand spare no expense when it comes to creating entertaining, and most importantly creating a world for the audience to be immersed in.  The attention to detail is top notch and the storytelling is extremely engaging.
This film is beautifully paced, with sufficient room for character development and setups for the plot of the next two films. And the balance of fast paced action with emotionally captivating character moments is very well handled. As always with Weta Workshop, the costumes, props and set designs are unprecedented, allowing for a more 'realistic' and believable fantastical experience.  Howard Shore's score is nothing short of a masterpiece, and blends beautifully with his work on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
The characters are very engaging, and Martin Freeman's Bilbo will be remembered for generations.  I could not have been happier to see Ian McKellan return with his perfect portrayal of Gandalf the Grey, as well as several other characters from the original trilogy.  The 13 dwarves were perfectly cast and uniquely designed, and several of them were very effective in bringing the lighter tone of the book through to the screen via their slightly whimsical personalities.
The first film in The Hobbit trilogy is sure to become a classic, and fits perfectly into the Middle-earth that Peter Jackson gave us a decade ago.  I very much look forward to the next two films.",1358294400,9,1439,5.0548523206751055

Why? because I as im sure alot of other LOTR fans were upset when you knew it all ended in The Return of the King but now you have 3 Hobbit movies to look forward to!!! Also you have the chance if Peter Jackson film and makes it this way you have a chance to have engaging thrilling and deep character's you can use making for the next 2 installations in the Hobbit, ( Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again ) and to have a trilogy you can just wait and look forward to What comes next!!!!

4639361,5,B0059XTU1S,"Jackson has created an alternate-Hobbit, which yet remains enough like the book to engage fans.

The movie does pretty much tell the story of the book. Yet it also adds or emphasizes things the book does not. Much of the stuff the movie adds beyond the books is there to tie the Hobbit into the overall story of the Lord of the Rings movies, to foreshadow what is to come. I liked this.

Like probably all Tolkien fans, I have some quibbles with this movie. The dwarves' song by Bilbo's fire about the dragon's gold near the beginning was too short - it was a great scene, and it's important in the book, but it's too brief in the movie. Also, the dwarves weren't quite dwarf enough. Also, as usual these days in Hollywood, the action and violence was excessive. I would have preferred a story closer to the book's original children's fantasy.

The character of Bilbo is also made a little more heroic, a little less timid than the book. I'm not sure if I like this, but it works in the movie.

One quibble I do NOT have is the length of the movie. I didn't feel like the movie was too long. However, when I watch it again I will be fast-forwarding past the fighting scenes, which I find tedious and superficial in most movies. The beginning also did drag a little. But as a Tolkien fan I don't begrudge spending those extra minutes in the marvelous world of Middle Earth.

Of course, this movie is just the first third of the story. I look forward to the remaining two sequels. Of course I hope they are as good as this first one. Based on Jackson's track record with four Tolkien movies so far, I'm optimistic.

It's obvious to me now after seeing this first Hobbit movie that Jackson is taking Tolkien's Hobbit, a children's story, and re-imagining it as a full-blown epic in its own right, to stand alongside his Lord of the Rings trilogy. After thinking about it, I like this. If I want the original Hobbit I can (and will) read the book again.

The thing I like about Jackson's Tolkien movies is that they portray characters and settings exactly as I pictured them from the books, yet the movies are different enough that they don't spoil my future re-reading of the books. I can enjoy both the books and the movies as parallel but not equivalent experiences.

On the whole, this movie was a marvelously successful effort that fans should not miss.

Note: This review is based on a theater viewing, since the DVD is currently not out yet. I intentionally saw the ""regular"" version - not 3D, not High Frame Rate. I was pretty sure I would enjoy the regular version best.",1358035200,2,2575,4.461702127659574
4639362,4,B0059XTU1S,"I stumbled into a near empty theater and collapsed into a seat. I put my 3D glasses on. The speakers hung above my head like war trumpets slipped into a familiar tune, and I was once again in Peter Jackson's Shire. Then 5 minutes rolls by. Then another 15. Pretty soon 30 minutes vanishes and Dildo Baggins and his merry band of ass pirates have yet to leave his crib. What's with all the character development when we have already seen it done this way before? Finally the movie takes off, and Dildo is well on his way to Brokeback Mountain... err... The Lonely Mountain this time. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey should really be called an ""Expected Journey"" because it's pretty much a repeat of The Fellowship of the Ring. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are some welcome surprises involving colorful residents of Middle Earth absent from the LOTR trilogy. Thorin Oakenshield does a half-decent job of filling Aragorn's void. Gollum is given a far better treatment in this installment through a very clever riddle exchange. The actor who plays young Bilbo is no Elijah Wood. Was slightly better than expected given all the negative rotten tomato reviews.",1357948800,,1169,4.82089552238806
4639363,4,B0059XTU1S,"This is a tough one to critique. Is it good? I suppose so. I enjoyed it, but there isn't much here that you haven't already seen in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, so you pretty much have to take it as an extension of those earlier films.

Here's the scoop. This is the story of Bilbo Baggins as he goes on his first adventure. It's the adventure whereby he tries to help the Dwarves regain their home. A home from which they were displaced many years prior due to the assault of a horrid, fire breathing dragon. It is also the adventure where Bilbo first meets Gollum and comes into the possession of the all important ring from the subsequent trilogy.

This has a lot of great stuff in it and is full of whimsy. You have a forest wizard who allows a bird to nest on his head and gets pulled along by a sled driven by a bunch of rabbits. Mountains that fight it out with one another and a band of Dwarves with more personality than one can readily digest. But there is also much familiar from the earlier three movies. Some of the landscapes and vast underground caverns will be all too familiar to viewers. The sweeping, overhead camera is, by now, a trademark of Jackson's directing. The CGI and a few other effects are essentially identical to the original three movies. Some of the costumes and set ideas were tweeked a bit but the overall look is familiar. The actors all do a stand-up job and Martin Freeman was a wise choice for a young Bilbo.

I did like this movie but I think it needed something to separate it from the originals. Some could argue, soundly, that, being cut from the same cloth, this movie needed to look like the others. IMHO, the other movies total nearly 12 hours and we've had an eyeful of these things. I think it time to come up with something new.",1357776000,,1782,4.3293413173652695
4639364,3,B0059XTU1S,"I haven't read the book, so I am unable to comment on the specifics of the book to film adaptation of ""The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey"". But Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was based on three pretty substantial books. Initially, ""The Hobbit"" was designed as two films, but Warner Bros. persuaded Jackson to expand it to a trilogy. So, a recap: ""Lord of the Rings"" is based on three books. One film, per book, more or less. ""The Hobbit"" is based on one book. How do you take material for two films and make it three? ""The Lord of the Rings"" was released on DVD at least three separate times, each with more footage added to the ""Director's Cut"". It would seem a safe bet to conclude the three films are being bulked up by this ""Special Footage"". But if the footage was deemed extra and cut out of the film in the first place, there was a reason for that. Generally, footage is cut because it slows down the story or is deemed superfluous. But in an effort to wring an extra $13 out of loyal fans, Warner Bros. will release one part of the trilogy each December for three years, guaranteeing a certain level of hype and income to their studio coffers. And the fan who watches ""The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey"" is treated to an almost leisurely look at Bilbo Baggins adventure with Gandalf the Grey and Thorin, the King of the Dwarves.

If all three films have approximately the same running time, fans can expect a very leisurely journey indeed. Between eight and nine hours' worth of time in Middle Earth.

The real trick is for Jackson to make three films, using footage that was cut and would have been included on the ""Super Special Absolutely Final Director's Cut Special Edition"" DVD and make the film seem like the original story was not changed at all. In ""Journey"" that isn't accomplished; it seems long. Would the initial dinner at Bilbo's house, when Gandalf introduces all of the dwarves, suffered from losing 15 minutes? I doubt it. This is just one example of a scene that is too long and there are others.

If the original plans to present two films remained intact, I have no doubt this film would have benefited greatly. But Warner Bros. decision to capitalize on a name brand and eke out an extra film will mar the entire series. I picture some executive at the studio is in his cave, covered with gold coins, rearing his head only to protect the fortune from pillage.

Jackson decided to shoot the film at a higher frame rate than normal. And the film is presented in the now obligatory 3-D (all the better to eke out $3 from each patron). The standard for film is 24 frames per second. For video, in this country, it is 30. This is why television looks so different from film and vice versa. I revel in the look of a beautifully photographed film. There is nothing quite like it and it helps to transport me to the fictional world the filmmaker is trying to create. And video has advanced considerably in the last few years.

I really admire filmmakers who try to push the envelope and come up with new techniques for or methods of filmmaking. And these experimental efforts are necessary because they keep pushing the medium forward, but if you look back at the early attempts of a new technique you can usually see where a technique started because it looks so rudimentary, so different. The High Frame Rate used in ""The Hobbit"" looks good and bad. When the film centers on a computer generated character or landscape, the HFR (High Frame Rate) adds an amazing layer of depth and when viewed in 3-D, the results are stunning; you feel as though you are looking through a window. That barrier between you and the film is removed and you really experience a new way of watching film.

But is this a good thing? Do you want to have that barrier removed? It is a bit strange and unsettling.

When the film concentrates solely on characters played by human beings, the HFR makes the characters and landscapes look like an old video television show. Have you ever seen an old television show, from the 60s or 70s, using the relatively new medium of video? They look strange and oft-putting because the color is over-saturated and slightly off. Some of the footage in ""The Hobbit"" looks like this. Maybe over time, as we get acclimated to this new look, the technique will become better and more acceptable. But right now, because it works 50% of the time, it seems to be more of a distraction.

The best thing I can say about this new technique is that my eyes were less tired after watching this film in 3-D.

""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a mixed bag. The excessive length and decision to make three films out of material already stretched to make two mar one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. Jackson's attempts to use a new filming technique show some promise, but the effect is too jarring at this point. The actors are all good, the special effects are fun and well-made, the landscapes lush and gorgeous.

But watching ""Journey"" feels like you are physically walking the journey with Bilbo and Gandalf. And this isn't a good thing.",1357689600,6,5129,4.541125541125541
4639365,4,B0059XTU1S,"This is a review from a non-fan of the whole Lord of the Rings universe. I really enjoyed my time at the movies watching the Hobbit. It wasn't the story or the characters that really drew me into this fantasy epic, it was the technology behind the filming process. I'm sure most people reading this are in the know to some degree about the HFR ( high-frame rate ) 48 frames per second vs the standard cinematic 24 frames per second debate. I must say that the 48 fps really made the film for me.

This is more of a technical review. I'm a filmmaker myself and have worked with the standard 24fps for the cinema look, 30fps for the video look, and a wide variety of frame rates ranging from 12-60fps for fast or slow motion effects. But this movie is quite apart from that. To see a huge budget film like the Hobbit on the big screen in 3D projected at 48fps, the way it was filmed, wow! A stunning experiences at the movies, one of a kind. Perhaps the most spectacular visuals on screen since Avatar three years ago.

Since this is a new process for a mainstream Hollywood narrative film, lots of people are going to compare it to things they already know. Such as videogames, high definition sports broadcasts, documentaries, soap operas, auto motion plus on your HDTV, what have you -- the Hobbit doesn't look like any of those experiences, it's something unique. What does doubling the frame rate do? Twice as much clarity in the picture, much more immersion in the environment, a lifelike quality to everything. Perhaps I can say that it felt almost like live theater in an alternate reality at times but with all the camera angles, shots, movement and effects that theater cannot provide.

Think of it this way... standard cinematic 24fps is beautiful, it's dreamy, like a window into another world, 24fps has the quality of a memory. 48fps instead has the quality of a ""you are there feeling"", as if you are in the environment with the characters interacting with the world. The 3D adds immensely to feeling immersed in this new environment. In fact this is the clearest, most natural 3D I've seen, the best since Avatar. Lots of richness, great depth of field and it's precisely because of the 48fps. Let's also mention the C.G.I. ( computer generated imagery ) -- the high frame rate is a blessing for C.G.I. How many recent movies have we seen where the computer effects look fake and annoying even though the films cost hundreds of millions of dollars? The most advanced effects are hampered by 24fps, here in the Hobbit at 48fps, the computer effects blend so well with the real actors and locations that you truly can stop worrying about them and accept the effects as if they were real life.

True... the physics of the C.G.I. can get a bit clunky at times. Those giant wolf dog monsters that are running around all the time, the physics aren't perfect. But I didn't expect the perfect physics displayed in Avatar -- The Hobbit still compensates with the pale Orc leader and the King of the Orcs in his mountain hideout. Those visuals are just ridiculous! Amazingly lifelike and convincing. And what about the scene with the three trolls who capture the dwarfs and Bilbo Baggins? Astounding special effects when viewed in 3D at 48fps.

Okay, enough about the HFR 3D -- the movie was filmed this way, it deserves to be seen this way, this is the intention of the director. This process of filming is not some cheesy gimmick, it's the real thing... a new magical experience at the cinema.

Some words about the film beyond the technical stuff. Um, well... the movie takes a while to get going, to find it's pace. The scene with the dwarfs with Bilbo and Gandalf in Bilbo's house goes on too long. Finally, once the adventure begins, the pacing picks ups and the movie blossoms. Peter Jackson's direction of actors is always high class. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is the standout performance. Andy Serkis returns as Gollum and for once I actually liked his antics ( thank you 48fps 3D! ). The action sequences are top-notch. The troll scene... the mountain dudes fighting in the rain at night... the big battle with the orcs near the end... all fantastic.

The tone of the film is more comical, lighter of heart than the gray, doom and gloom that plagued much of the ""Lord of the Rings trilogy"". This quality was a plus to me, I could never fully connect with Lord of the Rings for whatever reason. Maybe it was Frodo that irked me, I like the young Bilbo Baggins much more. Since the tone is lighter, the stakes are not death and end of world matters. It's about a group of oddballs who are journeying to defeat a dragon and the crazy adventures they get into along the way. It's almost a party movie. There is a lot of humor. Not to say the film has no gravitas, this is Peter Jackson's vision and he can turn the tone and go intense and savage when it needs to be. The dark elements are usually centered around that evil pale Orc.

The ending of the film is a ""to be continued"" scenario, no resolution -- as to be expected. There are two more Hobbit films coming up. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies with this one and I'll be back for more! Bring it, Peter Jackson, bring that HFR 3D! It's unique, it's thrilling and amazing! In fact, it's DA BOMB!",1357603200,5,5276,4.523060796645702
4639366,4,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit has been on the minds of fans ever since we heard The Lord of the Rings would be made into films first. It's actually a very ambitious story to translate to film when you consider the book's intended demographic of children; whereas The Lord of the Rings was definitively a story for adults. However, director Peter Jackson seems to have a very clear idea of how to balance The Hobbit.

The Hobbit seemed like a long time coming but it was well worth the wait. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is long. However it doesn't seem bloated. Despite a slower pace than the LOTR trilogy, it feels calmer and more deliberate. Utilizing an expanded story thanks to the Appendices, Unfinished Tales and Silmarillion, the characters and story feel more flushed out and not rushed. Yes there are changes from the book, (introducing an enemy for Thorin), but they don't ruin the movie. The pacing is refreshing. It gives the audience adequate breathing room between our action sequences and story development. While some may find the scenes with Radagast and Rivendell overly long, they actually work to successfully bridge The Hobbit to The Fellowship of the Ring just as intended. Whatever complaints I may have about the film are minimal when shown against the ultimate canvas of the finished product.

The film is also wonderfully acted - particularly by Martin Freeman (Bilbo). It's whimsical, lighthearted and relaxed. It still has the emotional impact and tension at the right moments, something Jackson has gotten better at in each film. As expected, Sir Ian McKellan also gives a great performance as Gandalf the Grey. The mysterious yet playful Gandalf from The Fellowship of the Ring is back, but as equally suspicious of the growing doom of Middle-Earth. Additionally, the Riddles in the Dark scene was perfect and absolutely how I imagined it as a kid when I read the book. Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Freeman have wonderful chemistry and it provides another layer to the complexity of Gollum/ Smeagol.

As for the High Frame Rate and visual aspect of the film, it's remarkable. At first it is a bit jarring. It seems almost too real and in that sense fake, but you then lose yourself and remember that life in fact actually looks like that! The Hobbit is crisp, bright and clean. Yes, there are times that the CGI seems a bit fake, but when the rest of the film is as beautiful, you don't give it a second notice. The 3D is used to expand the film visually and very rarely for sight gag and thanks to HFR is smooth and you forget it actually is 3D. It was an immense joy to watch. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking. Echoing the travel scenes from Fellowship, The Hobbit also gives us glorious wide shots of the early journey and the HFR and 3D give it unimaginable scope.

The film seems inevitable to divide people on the HFR vs standard 24 frames/ second, but Jackson may indeed have begun the change to a new cinema experience. Change is unsettling and people are inherently resistant to it, but when its all said and done, this is absolutely a film to see in the theaters; and more importantly one to be seen in HFR if you're lucky enough to have a theater projecting it in that format as Jackson intended it to be seen.

Verdict: See In Theaters!

4639367,4,B0059XTU1S,"This is a review of the film as a self-contained work for people who are not Lord of the Rings buffs. If you don't fall into that category, I invite you to stop reading now. Almost 40 years ago I read ""The Hobbit and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" with middling interest, then bogged down somewhere in the first third of ""The Two Towers."" I realize these books are near-sacred texts for many and apologize for not sharing your enthusiasm. I don't mind if you vote my review unhelpful if it fails to do what I intend, which is review the movie on its own, but please don't vote it unhelpful because I don't bring to bear your level of expertise on the books. (Also, I have not seen any of the LOTR trilogy movies.) I was willing to see ""The Hobbit"" because my kid wanted to go and I had become a fan of director Peter Jackson based on ""Heavenly Creatures.""

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman as a young man; Ian Holm as an old man), a Hobbit who likes his quiet, orderly life in The Shire of Middle Earth, is recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) to accompany a group of Dwarfs on their quest to recapture their treasure-filled home in the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Along the way to the mountain, guided for much of the journey by Gandalf, the Dwarfs and Bilbo battle various monsters and dark forces and receive help from the Dwarfs' historic enemies the Elves. ""The Hobbit"" is a bit slow in the beginning, but about a third of the way through, the pace picks up, draws the viewers into the action and leaves us in awe of the fllm's craftsmanship in creating one spectacular action sequence after another.

The costumes, makeup, sets and special effects are wonderful throughout. If you suffer from vertigo, be careful. A number of highly convincing scenes (even in flat-screen; I did not see the 3D) take place in narrow, high places. The acting is decent for the most part, especially veterans Ian McKellan and Ian Holm. Christopher Lee makes a stunning Saruman, the White Wizard whose wisdom Gandalf consults during the journey. The script has its share of bromides and stilted dialogue, especially in the beginning and in the sequences that take place in Rivendell, the home of the Elves, but it does the job of keeping comprehensible and clear a story with a large number of quirky-named characters, groups, places and objects. For example, Orcrist is the name of a sword, an Orc is a monster that attacks mounted on another monster called a Warg, Azog is an Orc war chief, Radagast is a wizard, Thorin is a Dwarf king, Moria is a Dwarf kingdom, etc. You can see where this could get confusing for the uninitiated.

Overall, I found ""The Hobbit"" entertaining and beautifully made, enough so that I will watch the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Parent note: This film was more violent than I expected. There are some pretty bloody battle sequences. A PG-13 rating is appropriate.",1357516800,6,2900,4.605415860735009

And as far as the people that think that these ideas were borrowed from Harry Potter or think that this is a sequel to The Lord of the Rings, they should not be allowed to comment. The people that gave it low ratings apparently did not watch the same movie I did.",1357344000,4,438,3.8777777777777778

4639370,3,B0059XTU1S,"After the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I hoped and expected that director Peter Jackson would stick to the same format for The Hobbit. In some ways he does, but the feel isn't exactly the same.

What I like about this first installment of Tolkien's first trip to Middle Earth is that the same sets are used for Hobbiton, and many of the actors return. It was also a good idea to reprise some of the music used in the previous trilogy. When I saw the familiar setting and heard the music, I was already partly won over by the movie. Unfortunately, my opinion had changed long before it finally ended.

So why do I have mixed feelings?

The first major problem was the decision to make this much shorter story into a trilogy. Many of the scenes felt overly long, and did not serve much purpose. I didn't have a watch or a phone with me, but it seemed as if we spent around an hour in Bilbo's house before the quest even began.

The Hobbit is the tale of Bilbo's first adventure. After a visit from Gandalf (Ian McKellen), dwarves start showing up at his house unannounced. This unwelcome interruption of his routine is disturbing to Bilbo (Martin Freeman), as he learns that Gandalf has persuaded the dwarves that Bilbo should join their quest to retrieve their stolen gold from the dragon, Smaug. This part of the story shows the initial stages of that journey.

I'm not really sure what The Hobbit wanted to be, or what the intended audience was. Like the books, some of the scenes involve characters breaking into song on a few occasions. I found this to be annoying rather than charming, but I am sure that some will be happy that songs were included. One of the flaws with the generally excellent previous trilogy was the use of humor. Well, The Hobbit turns that element up several notches, and most of it is incredibly stupid. The first clue was a belching scene at dinner in Bilbo's house, but the humor was relentless. The most out of place example was when one of the major villains died and had to deliver a one-liner as he expired. For me, this had the effect of completely removing any tension or drama. It was like watching a Roger Moore Bond movie set in Middle Earth.

The choice of Freeman as Bilbo seemed odd to me, but I must admit that he did a decent job. A few of his lines were actually funny.

I'm sorry to belabor the point, but the use of humor seemed to contradict the overall feel of the movie. Half of the speeches were too epic in tone to be taken seriously. I didn't know whether I was watching a Shakespearean production, a spoof, or an action movie. One of the people sitting behind me felt compelled to laugh at almost every line of dialogue, so the jokes obviously worked for somebody. My idea of humor would be to have Hugo Weaving saying ""Mister Oakenshield"" in his best Agent Smith voice, so it's probably a good thing that I didn't write the screenplay.

It's a shame that The Hobbit doesn't seem to be up to the same standard set by Lord of the Rings. The movie's opening has been incredibly successful, and my theater was still sold out two weeks after it was released. I have to wonder how many patrons will return for the remainder of the trilogy.

The setting is beautiful, and some of the actors return, but there are too many inconsistencies for me to give The Hobbit a passing grade. If you want to hang out in Middle Earth, watch some great special effects, and admire some enormously detailed sets, you might enjoy the movie. If you care about the books, or the characters, you may be sorely disappointed. I saw the film four hours ago and can only put faces to the names of four of the dwarves. They were thinly-drawn at best.

This release might just persuade me to skip the other two installments in theaters. I'll borrow the Blu-rays and see if the story improves.",1357171200,5,3828,4.44017094017094
4639371,5,B0059XTU1S,"Are you ready to return to middle-earth? Why wouldn't you be? Peter Jackson, with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, brought us to a place that many thought wasn't possible except in the written form. A product of many of our childhoods, J.R.R. Tolkien constructed an elaborate world of wizards, trolls, elves, dwarves, humans and most importantly Hobbits. It is an elaborately detailed world of maps, homelands, stories and adventures. It couldn't possibly be realized anywhere close to what J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination did. Yet, Jackson pulled it off better than anyone could have hoped. Now, he's trying again.

""The Hobbit"" is a step backward into the history of middle-earth. It is quite simply the adventure that Bilbo Baggins takes that leads to him writing his book, ""There and back again"". Peter Jackson is trying to do the unthinkable with this trilogy, duplicate the magic he pulled off before. Much can be told from this first installment and whether or not the magic is still there.

The movie, filmed at twice frame-speed as traditional film (48 frames) has many geeks talking about how it will look too real. Ultimately, at 48 frames, it could look as crisp and real as a soap opera. Well, first of all, with a film like this, it takes a lot of guts to attempt such a thing; a movie with such obvious special effects and makeup. Yet, the opposite could also be achieved; a level of escapism and realism that not only delivers a quality movie experience, but also sucks you into a world that you don't want to leave.

Peter Jackson has learned a few things from his first trilogy and you can see it in ""The Hobbit"". This world is even more realized. The characters are more fleshed out. Richard Armitage's depiction of Thorin is full of heart and passion. The faithfulness to the book itself is even more realized. More importantly, the journey is even more colorful and creative.

""The Hobbit"" is a lot of the same. It's another journey full of adventure and trolls, dwarves and orcs, but again, it is a quality journey. The escapism you feel in this film is like nothing you've ever felt before. When it was time to go, at the end of the film, I didn't want to. I was there. I was in middle-earth, ready to take the journey ahead with Bilbo, Gandolff and the band of Dwarves. I didn't care about length or how long I had been sitting there. I was invested. That, is really all any movie can do.",1357171200,316,2409,4.621495327102804
4639372,4,B0059XTU1S,"So finally, we have the film that should have come out first.  Like so many readers, I was introduced to The Lord of the Rings by way of The Hobbit.  But when I finally read The Lord of the Rings it was a real shock - the multiple plot threads, factions, names, territories, languages, etc. made it difficult for me to follow.  With The Hobbit I had a simple point of view, a character I could relate to, and a variety of monsters and wizards that were alternately amusing and terrifying.  It's ironic then, that where ""The Lord of the Rings'"" depth made it fertile ground for a movie, ""The Hobbit's"" simplicity makes it more of a challenge to translate onto the big screen.

Part of the problem is simply that ""The Hobbit"" movie came after ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Although the characters are similar, they are not the same - the imposing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) we knew from the trilogy is a pipe-smoking goofball here who winces when his boss Saruman (Christopher Lee) appears.  Saruman is less imperious and more cranky; Elrond (Hugo weaving) more talkative and less imperious; and the dwarves are transformed from dour warriors to brawling roustabouts. This isn't necessarily out of sync with the spirit of the book - it's just that ""The Hobbit"" was written for a different audience, before the One Ring became more than just Gollum's (Andy Serkis) precious.

There are numerous attempts to integrate ""The Hobbit"" into ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy that feel forced.  The rise of the Necromancer (Sauron) is grafted on to Radagast the Brown's (Sylvester McCoy) appearance, who is such a bizarre character that he feels like he invaded ""The Hobbit"" from another film.  And that film is Peter Jackson's repertoire of other films.  It's easy to forget that Jackson was a producer for ""Bad Taste"" and ""The Frighteners.""  Jackson is now unfettered and can do pretty much whatever he wants, and if that means he wants to put a character with bird poop on his head riding a bunny sleigh, then by golly that's what he's gonna do! For fans accustomed the stentorian tone of the trilogy, Radagast will be quite a shock.

Still, Jackson on a bad day is still head-and-shoulders above many other filmmakers, and his attention to detail will thrill fans of the series that are just happy just to revisit Middle-Earth. Sure, the monsters talk more, but their pedigree from the trilogy is evident in their flawless animation. There's enough goblins, orcs, and trolls to fill a Dungeons & Dragons dungeon.

Gollum is the bright light here. It's clear Smaug is being saved for another film, the dwarves are too numerous to flesh them out as characters, and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is just finding his furry footing. But the surprises that made ""The Hobbit"" so memorable have all been spoiled by the series that would come afterward: the ring's powers, Gollum's appearance, the magic tricks Gandalf pulls (turns out you just have to whisper to moths to summon eagles).  As so many fans have asked of the Star Wars series...would the movie franchise make sense if it was watched in chronological order?  Should it?

The answer, unfortunately, is moot - ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy came first, and all ""The Hobbit"" can do, like Bilbo, is struggle to keep up.",1357084800,7,3248,4.761140819964349

4639374,2,B0059XTU1S,"S P O I L E R  W A R N I N G !!!

Peter Jackson's LotR trilogy blew me away. His Hobbit severely disappointed me.

The book is charming and whimsical. The movie is hectic, loud, full of unnecessary action scenes and creatures that either reminded me of other movies (for example, Jabba the Hut made an appearance, complete with cackling sidekick creature, in the form of the goblin king; or the white orc who looked like a cross between the creator-dude in Prometheus and the coughing skeletor-like general in one of the Star Wars prequels; or the trolls, which looked like bigger versions of Kreacher in Harry Potter) or that we had already seen in LotR (for example Gandalf calling the eagles by means of a moth).

If you're like my brother and feel that the sense of traveling with the characters got lost in LotR - it is much, much worse in The Hobbit: One second Bilbo catches up with the dwarves, the next they're running away from wargs, the next they're in Rivendell... More time is spent on an idiotic underground battle with goblins (a sequence that looks like a combination of the Mines of Moria and the CGI-swoop through Saruman's forge in LotR) than on the journey from Hobbiton to Rivendell.

Speaking of journey: In the book, the dwarves leave Bag End in a mess and Bilbo spends a good while cleaning and washing up and having a leisurely breakfast, glad that they're gone, and then Gandalf shows up and shoos him out the door. This scene is completely missing in the movie, so people unfamiliar with the book cannot possibly understand why Bilbo decides to follow Thorin & Co.

Don't get me started on the character of Radagast and the subplot involving him. CGI slapstick! Other major eye-roll-inducing moments include the dying hedgehog, the sequence when the goblin king gets killed (""Oh, well, that'll do it."") and way too many scenes in which the characters would have been killed or at least injured, yet they get up and walk away without a scratch. Way too cartoonish.

The riddle scene with Gollum (the most convincing CGI creature in the whole movie and - with the exception of Gandalf - the most accomplished and convincing actor) was fairly well done, albeit unnecessarily ""humorized"" (""I wasn't talking to you, was I?"").

Overall the movie overloads Bilbo's tale with too much background story in its attempt to connect it to LotR. It seems quite obvious to me that Jackson and his crew consider this their last visit to Middle Earth, so they're packing as much into it as they possibly can - and then some.

To sum it up: This is not The Hobbit, it's The Hollywobbit.",1356912000,15,2596,4.626086956521739
4639375,5,B0059XTU1S,"I was thrilled and a bit nervous to see The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey.  Would the movie follow the book?  Would it be entertaining and worthwhile while staying true to what Tolkien created?  For me, the answer to all these questions was yes. While the order of events was altered somewhat and many new scenes were added to turn The Hobbit into a trilogy, the changes only made characters deeper, the plot more exciting, and the story more full.  Plenty of action, laughs, and stunning scope make this movie a winner.  More importantly, it keeps the Tolkien spirit alive and is very inspiring. For fans of the book and others who have never read it, The Hobbit will be entertainment at its best.",1356912000,22,698,4.642276422764228
4639376,4,B0059XTU1S,"After Peter Jackson's multi-oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, skepticism was voiced about how he might expand Tolkien's earlier and slimmer 1937-published prequel into three full-length films, and the original idea was a 2-part `Hobbit'. If the first installment is indicative of the overall standard of the forthcoming trilogy, we needn't worry: the Kiwi with the golden touch has pulled it off again.

Tolkien's dwarves are a grudge-bearing, avaricious but tirelessly industrious race who create great underground kingdoms to mine Middle Earth's riches, with a history of cool relations with other races (especially the elves) but ultimately `good guys'. `The Hobbit' concerns the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's bachelor-uncle and a reluctant participant in a quest with 13 dwarves led by the redoubtable Thorin Oakenshield (played here by a brooding and rage-driven Richard Armitage) to recover their distant `Kingdom under the Mountain' for several years occupied by the fire-breathing dragon Smaug.

In similar style to the `Fellowship of the Ring' Jackson's new epic opens by offering the audience a brief dramatized history lesson of the dragon's assault on the Kingdom under the Mountain & what became of the dwarves after their exile. Then we pan to the quiet pastoral life of Bilbo Baggins in his hobbit hole, some 60 years before handing over `the ring' to nephew Frodo, and the arrival of the 13 uninvited dwarves who proceed to eat him out of house & home. The superb Ian McKellen (in a role he was surely born to play) once again presides as Gandalf, who has convinced the dwarves that they need Bilbo as a burglar to succeed on their mission because the dragon can smell dwarves a mile away but doesn't know the smell of hobbits.

Martin Freeman is an unexpectedly excellent Bilbo, a more complex and less instantly-likeable character than Elijah Wood's shining & heroic Frodo. Other characters from Jackson's LotR trilogy appear briefly to tie this prequel in to the later epic: Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) & Saruman (Christopher Lee) reprise their roles in a mini-replay of the council at Elrond's house; a scene recorded in Tolkien's historical notes but not in the original published `The Hobbit' and inserted here to offer the audience link to the follow-up LotR in describing the revival of Sauron.

The seamless integration of up-to-the-minute CGI with live actors is again a big feature, endowing the action with often breath-taking realism. The scene with three mountain trolls (played as dwarf-roasting gourmets with cockney accents!) straight from Tolkien's original text is a fine example; the giant figures mix-in seamlessly with the small, creating a real-imaginary world of astonishing detail. The villains of the piece are the dwarf-hating, warg-riding orcs, a personal vendetta between orc-chief Azog (played to perfection by a malice-oozing Manu Bennett) & Thorin realized in grisly detail and justifying the film's not-for-unaccompanied-children rating. Andy Serkis reprises his starring role from LotR with a masterful performance as the CGI-enhanced Gollum in Tolkien's `riddles in the dark' chapter. This is the film's key scene, dramatic tension revealing the pathos & complexity of the character as the `one ring' chooses its new bearer and firmly ties the narrative in to the LotR trilogy.

Peter Jackson is revealed once again as the undisputed master of bringing Tolkien to the big screen. A more linear tale than the multiply sub-plotted LotR and with fewer characters, Jackson's adapted screenplay for `The Hobbit' remains faithful to Tolkien's original tale and offers us a great cinematic experience. The script is intelligent, the continuity & pacing superb, the action sequences edge-of-seat gripping - though there might be a bit too much frantic chase-movie screen time & too many cliff-hangers for some viewers. The panoramic NZ South-Island locations are sumptuous, with distance shots of tiny figures in huge natural landscapes & soaring snow-clad mountains complete with cascading waterfalls. There is light & shade, even humor to a level of slapstick worthy of circus-clowns in the precipitous underground goblin-kingdom scenes dominated by a brilliant performance from the heavily-disguised Barry Humphries.

The DVD release is region-free. The 3D adds a lot to the experience, and can be recommended unreservedly.

It looks like Jackson and his team have raised the bar again and might have another cinematic triumph on their hands.",1356912000,,4524,5.372355430183357
4639377,1,B0059XTU1S,"I was looking forward to this. We went as a family for Christmas , my eighty year old mother, my wife and four kids -  our seventeen year old movie-buff came under protest.  Oh dear!  At one point when the trolls were discussing what seasoning to eat the dwarves with, I looked around, my mum was asleep, my wife was asleep, my daughter mouthed her favourite put down - `Fail'.
Why so bad?  I think the movie lacks an interesting narrative and a credible hero, as well as which, if you liked the Ring movies (which all my family did) you are very familiar with the special effects - when the dwarves are hanging from a tree over a cliff, Gandalf grabs a butterfly and whispers to it before releasing it.  We all know the eagles are being sent for, and instead of tension wondering how the dwarves will escape, I got irritated that the eagles might not show up on time.
The narrative is very thin, the scene where the dwarves arrive in Bibo's house and he is reluctant to join them on their adventure went on forever, the trolls trying to eat the dwarves, much too long. The stone giants reminded me of the tree-people in the Ring.  Ok, I can understand  the journey to see if the homeland is habitable, but only if the heroes are sympathetic.  I guess I didn't warm to the dwarves,  first there are too many of them - 13? , then they seem to have rhyming names - Bing and Bong, Ding and Dong, and none of them get killed (so far) so its hard to get invested in any of them.
The accents (for UK/Irish viewers) have moved around a bit - the dwarves seem to have Scottish or Northumbrian accents ( though James Nesbitt keeps his neutral Norn' Ireland accent) ; the trolls have stolen the Cockney accents that the Orks had in the last series of movies, and the Orks have now got so inhuman that they need subtitles.  This probably doesn't matter to an international audience, but it grates on me. Also Gandalf and Cate Blanchett are purely wasted in this movie.
Towards the end Bilbo says `I think the worst is over',  an almost soap-opera link to the next movie.  It is for me, I won't be back.",1356652800,20,2091,4.319693094629156
4639378,5,B0059XTU1S,"I put off seeing the Hobbit movie in part because I read all of the critics' reviews of it. You may know what they said: too slow-paced, too stodgily faithful to the book, overwhelmed by extraneous material thrown in, just plain silly, and just not up to the prequel-sequel. Now that I've taken in a matine of the movie, I have to ask this question:

What movie did the critics watch?

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (TH:AUJ) was the most fun that I've had at the theater in a long time. Yes, folks, I did use the f-word just now. Let me use it again: fun, fun, fun! I won't say that the first Hobbit movie was better than the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy, but I will say that it was more fun.

As a book, The Hobbit presented a challenge for being filmed: it's both a children's book and the prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the acme of high fantasy. Given such a source, a movie based on The Hobbit had to combine whimsy with high adventure without letting either overwhelm the other.

I'm here to say that Peter Jackson rose gloriously to the challenge. I fell in love with TH:AUJ from its introduction, intercutting bucolic scenes from the Shire on the eve of Bilbo Baggins's one hundred and eleventh birthday with majestic, marvelous, and tragic scenes of the Mannish trade center of Dale and the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. These scenes showed all of the loving attention to detail of the LOTR movies and beautifully set the scene for a sixty-year's younger Bilbo's adventures.

In the inimitable ""perfectly faithful to the book, which I'm completely rewriting"" Peter Jackson style, he pitchforks us moviegoers next into Bilbo's meeting with the wandering wizard Gandalf and with thirteen Dwarves led by the obsessive Thorin Oakenshield, heir to the lost kingdom of Erebor. Jackson captures beautifully the mirth and mayhem of Bilbo's unexpected dinner party as well as the dark drama behind Thorin's quest, on which the reluctant Bilbo is supposed to go as a burglar.

Soon, Bilbo is running out his front door without a handkerchief, and he and we are off on an adventure that won't let up. Some critics complain that each scene TH:AUJ is longer than scenes were in the LOTR trilogy, but what the critics call a fault, I call a virtue: we have a chance to see a whole storyline play out rather than watching telescoped bits and pieces of scenes that we got in the trilogy. The pace and the flow of TH:AUJ made it seem to me far shorter than its two hours and forty some-odd minutes of running time. For me, the movie never slowed down.

Parts of TH:AUJ are over the top, but, more often than not, gloriously so. I found Sylvester McCoy's portrayal of Radagast the Brown -- a portrayal in which he largely reprises his take on Dr. Who -- far less intrusive than critics have made it out to be. Even his rabbit-drawn sleigh had a mad logic to it. As for mad logic, the battle in the halls of the Great Goblin under the Misty Mountains won't be believed, but may well just be enjoyed.

Between scenes of adventure, there are scenes of Elvish wonders and of Middle-Earth's beauty that will bring tears of joy to Tolkienphiles' eyes. At its best, TH:AUJ is a visual extravaganza that makes the prequel-sequel look drab.

TH:AUJ goes only through chapter seven of The Hobbit. Purists may sniff at the enhanced role given to Bilbo in the movie compared with what he played in that part of the book, in which he was mainly baggage. My response is, ""Hey, the enhanced role works!"" Along with it, you get to see Gollum, as scene-stealing as ever,and even glimpses of the dragon Smaug, who must carry the next movie, and looks as if he'll do so with style.

I'll be the first to admit that TH:AUJ isn't as respectable as the LOTR trilogy. On the other hand, as Bilbo Baggins learns, it's not until you give up being respectable that you have adventures.",1356566400,68,3876,4.556034482758621
4639379,5,B0059XTU1S,"Our family (Age 7 to 55) loves the LOTR movies and has been looking forward to this movie for a few years.  After reading the reviews we were wondering whether to go see it or wait for it on DVD, but finally gave in and watched it Christmas Eve.  I really don't understand the bad reviews, we all loved it.  Where was the lack of action, it had plenty, along with great character development, bringing back old favorites and tying the story into LOTR and give us the pleasure of seeing Middle Earth once again.  Our only complaint is we have to wait another year to see part 2 and then another 7 months to finish out the story.  It is not as epic as LOTR because it is a different story and we have only seen the first of 3 movies.  Go see it and have fun knowing this sets up LOTR and may be our final journey to Middle Earth.",1356393600,9,827,4.074074074074074
4639380,5,B0059XTU1S,"Let me start by saying that I'm a big Tolkien buff and that I went into this experience very apprehensive given the liberties Jackson took with the LOTR movies, that as a purist did not sit well with me. Why omit perfectly good material (old forrest, barrow downs, etc) and make up new material that is only introduced to make up an action beat and shake things up (Aragorns little Warg detour in the second movie as well as Frodos visit to Pelargrir come to mind) but I digress...

Of course Jackson added material here as well, the difference is; it wasn't specifically already introduced by Tolkien differently (or if it was the changes were more forgivable and served the story better, I.e Azog as a villain) It's believable and it allowed Jackson creative freedom w/o interrupting the flow of the book. I.e. if a scene was described in the book the movie usually followed that fairly closely, the new material was introduced using the annals of the LOTR and only hinted in 'the hobbit', which in my opinion was a genius move to lift a fairly light hearted book into a somewhat darker and more interesting realm of middle earth (considering Tolkien wrote this before the LOTR as a story to read to his children and not as a prequel to LOTR per se).

I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience and for me the 3 hrs flew by ending a logical closure point at the Carrock. I watched it in HFR 3D and quite frankly I have no idea why professional critics knock this new format. The picture quality was amazing, the slight headache I usually experience after a long 3D movie was a no show and the experience was immersive, it felt like you lean out of your window and watch middle earth pass by below you, absolutely breathtaking and the visuals alone would be reason enough to watch it again.

For me it was a rare true 5 star experience, that I'm planning on repeating in a few weeks...",1356307200,8,1894,4.484057971014493
4639381,5,B0059XTU1S,"In this age of short attention spans, many have said the movie was too long.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it because of the landscapes and beautiful places.  I was sad that it was over. I did not know going in that the Hobbit would be split in three.  This means they had plenty of time to introduce subplots, which were quite interesting.  The cast was undeniably great!  Even Christopher Lee, who is 90+ yrs. old appears as Saruman.  We get to meet a wizard of the forest, who was a lot of fun as an eccentric dog sled (in this case special super-fast rabbits) driver.  We do get a brief look at the elves again, and I truly love that place.  I really recommend seeing this when you really have a long, unhurried time of liesure.  This isn't something to get through quickly.  I think I will see it again at the theater.

I want also to really emphasize that they really weaved some good humor in there too.  The evil darkness of the ring, while peeping out of the pit just a bit, was not falling all over making the film dark and depressing.  There's the famous great scene where they meet trolls in the forest at night.  The dialog, voices, and the way they try to reason with the trolls is truly hilarious.  People were not expecting it based on the darkness of the Rings trilogy.  Be open for humor!

The other most funny character is the king of the Goblins.  The whole movie is just worth it to hear him speak and listen to his lines.  He is a bulbous, fat, ill-tempered, boil-covered, slobbering sweating gooey gross character, but he is really funny because amongst the gobs of ignoramous goblins, he has wit galore.

Gollum fans will of course enjoy time with Andy Serkis's character.  All in all I am entranced by the Tolkein legacy and the beauty of these films.",1356307200,6,1781,4.401840490797546

The pacing is so slow that I found myself proverbially ""counting ceiling tiles"" in the theater.  LOTR was an epic story in 3 books, and it deserved the full-trilogy treatment.  The Hobbit is NOT en epic story (it's just a bunch of dwarves that get kicked out of their home by a nasty dragon, and then try to get back in again).  This is NOT the stuff of epic trilogies, and making it so results in an endless, moves-like-molasses yawn-fest.  Getting past this basic problem, the movie is also relatively grotesque to watch -- it's like a cross between ""Time Bandits"", ""Shrek"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - with the worst elements taken from each.  BIG disappointment, after how much I loved the LOTR trilogy.  If you remember the empty feeling after seeing ""The Phantom Menace"", AFTER having seen the 3 original Star Wars movies, you have a pretty good idea what to expect here.

4639383,5,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson has laced together a delightful film for the young at heart!

Stodgy old timers forget the times when the world was a mystery in which youngsters feared every day would be the same as yesterday.  Absolutely nothing that ever happened was ever unexpected.  All the giants had been slain, and all the dragons gone away.

  Taking on a classic is admirable stuff.  Approaching the Hobbit in what seems to be so soon following the monumental 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was simply courageous.  Expectations are immeasurable.  Individual demands are often impossible to meet.  And finishing even the introduction to the Hobbit tale in this oversized age of media-hype can be deemed missing the mark.

Yet those who love the masterful telling of a great tale will be enthralled with joy at the spectacle of new things found in old attic boxes.  And for any who battle against looking to the future, take along a young one with you, and watch the wonder of life unfold through their eyes.

If you've seen LOTR, you must see the Hobbit.  If you haven't, you still must see the Hobbit.

4639385,1,B0059XTU1S,"I am a long time, huge fan, of The Hobbit and LOTR books.  I was really looking forward to this movie, as I thought the LOTR movies were very well done, particulary The Fellowship of the Ring, but this movie was very dissappointing.  First of all, does The Hobbit really need to be made into 3 movies?  Really?  There were too many ""filler"" side line stories going on in this movie, which in my opinion, took away from the main story line.  Also, the fight scenes weren't very good (and there are alot of them), I found myself getting bored when the fight sequences came up.  The fighting was not exciting, or distinctive, rather it was repetitive and kind of all blurred together in the end.  There was too much fighting I think, and not enough story, if that makes sense.  They did change some things about the story too, and I didn't really care for the changes.  The gollum scenes and the eagles were cool though.  There needed to be more Bilbo time too, as I didn't feel like his character had a strong presence in the movie, and he is the main character - the dwarves have a stronger presence than Bilbo.  The movie dragged on over all, felt slow, I really think this should have been made into a single flick, and should have stayed closer to the books story line.  In summary, to me, this movie missed the target, and it does not succeed in capturing the heart of the story of The Hobbit.",1356134400,29,1396,4.368217054263566
4639386,5,B0059XTU1S,"The LOTR series set the template for this film. It incorporates many of the same characters, sets, and sound track.

LOTR was arguably the best film(s) ever made. No one expected this from Peter Jackson, whose films before and since have left little to rave about. There were scenes where I felt Jackson was resting on his laurels, not wanting to do a second take, while there were other scenes which left me breathless.

In case you didn't realize it, this is a prequel to LOTR. In this story a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the slobbish Dwarves regain their mountain taken by a dragon. In this episode, Bilbo acquires his sword ""Sting"" and ""The Ring."" They do not reach the mountain.

Gandalf appears to be our only source for truisms and memorable lines. ""Your house is now behind you, the world is ahead."" or ""Evil will always look for a foothold in the world"" or ""True courage is not knowing when to take a life, but when to spare one."" This written with WWII in the mind of Tolkien. I couldn't help but think of the dragon as Germany or of the Elves appeasement philosophy that the world was at peace while battles raged on.

Martin Freeman has a very strong British accent, unlike the other Hobbits. Initially I thought his character was a weak link, similar to Elijah Wood as Frodo. He grew stronger in his role as the film progressed, although I am not convinced he was the best choice.

Sylvester McCoy plays Radagast, the Brown. He is a wizard Peter Jackson cut out of the original screenplay for ""The Fellowship of the Rings."" The 90 year old Christopher Lee returns to his role as does Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Andy Serkis, and Hugo Weaving.

A worthy effort.",1356134400,,1720,4.586319218241043
4639387,2,B0059XTU1S,"I went to this movie with the greatest of hopes.  Our family has been the greatest Tolkien fans, and have admired all the books and the adaptation that Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  So with that in mind, and the positive attitude that we had going in to the movie, that fact that I am only giving it two stars should say alot.

Jackson totally overplayed any action scenes and pushed reality to nonsense.  It would be simply impossible to fall hundreds of feet hitting rock sufaces and still survive, and yet these drwaves do this over and over.  Bridges perfectly swing to and fro to rescue them from danger in what could never happen in reality, heavy items (6000 pound troll?) seemingly do not crush them, and when Thorin is crushed in the jaws of a horrible warg/wolf, he doesn't die.  Of course.  The action scenes were so overwhelming and unbelievable they became boring.  Enough already.

Jackson took so many liberties with the story line that it barely resembles the book.  The dialogues are entirely different - it is barely recognizable except for the names of the characters and the places they visit, such as the Shire, Rivendell (Imladris), the Lonley Mountain in the distance.  I felt that Jackson must have quite some superiority to think that he could make the story better than Tolkien, who is arguably one of the best story tellers of the last century.  Jackson, a little humility may have helped you make a better movie.

Then there is the revolting aspect to the movie.  Yes, revolting.  Not content with the hideousness of the orcs and goblins in the last film, he had to make them even worse.  Since the goblin scenes make up such a huge portion of the movie, it was disgusting to look at these disfigured beings for hours.  The Pale Goblin, has a metal spear protruding through his arm as his ""prosthethic.""  So that wasn't gross enough?  In a B style movie maneuver, Jackson resorts to sophomorish ways to get laughter - you guessed it, SNOT.  A twenty foot long thread of snot ejected onto Bilbo.  For the rest of the movie (about half?) we get to see this become encrusted and dryed on Bilbo's clothing.  Still not suffienctly disgusted?  How about bird excrement running down Radagast's hair, face, and beard as a permanent adornment.  Tolkien depicted Radagast as a unique, solitary individual.  Jackson made him fit for an insane assylum.  Radagast is pulled around on a sled towed by obliging rabbits, whose combined weight would not equal the wizard's weight.  Despite this, these rabbits also had the ability to out run warg wolves.  Totally unrealistic.

Jackson made the dwarves look ridiculous.  Other than three that looked presentable and rather swashbuckling, the rest had excessive and bizarre use of braids, one that coiled around his head looking like brains, one sported a hat that had exagerated points to each side.  I think Jackson would have gotten further with more moderation in their costumes.  He made them look buffoonish, ignorant, slovenly.  At the house of Elrond, they disparaged the food, and were utterly rude.

While we are at the House of Elrond in Imladris, I want to point out that Hugo Weaving was one of the few charaters that made the movie tolerable, and unfortunately his parts are very brief.  He looks impressive, strong, and masculine riding in on a stunning horse.  In Rivendell, the book talks of great banqueting and even better storytelling and music.  None of that is shown in the movie, with only a brief scene with an elve playing an artificial harp in the background.  Well, I play harp, and that was bogus.  The elve is not really playing the harp at all, just strumming her fingers back and forth totally out of sinc with the harp music.  Stupid.  With great harp musicians like Loreena McKennit and Deborah Henson Conant, Jackson couldn't have found ONE person who could really play a harp in the House of Elrond?  He'll have thousands of little skulls built for a twenty second scene, but he can't find a real harp and a real harpist?  Please, Peter, we are not stupid!

I am so glad this movie was rated PG-13 since there is some serious nightmare influencing material in it, and if you have smaller children I strongly recommend that you not take them.  While it is rated PG-13 I know that New Line is heavily marketing to the younger crowd.  Let's face it, how many teenages play with Legos, some but not alot, and they are heavily marketing toys like those for the 7 and up audience.

I do not hold out any hope for the next two movies since so many liberties were already taken with the plot and characters in this one.  The grotesque elements are not worth enduring again.  We will not be going to the next two films when they come out.  I would rather preserve the images in my mind from the books, and not have Jackson's distorted depiction ruin it.",1356134400,30,4863,4.670200235571261
4639388,4,B0059XTU1S,"That's not a serious film about Tolkien and his ""The Hobbit"" novel, the novel before the ""Lord of the Rings"" series. That's a movie for young teenagers. Action is primary and slightly primitive too. And what's more they cut up a one volume book into slices.

Apart from that disappointment, we have to say it is well done and the special effects are perfect but they are nothing but special effects and they produce no sympathy, empathy or compassion. They just produce surprise and movement.

So what about that Hobbit Bilbon Sacquet, one of these simple short men who live somewhere underground among the roots of some trees, who dedicate their lives to studying and accumulating knowledge about everything and the rest. Scholars, savants, scientists, how can he go on roads and run after adventure? Hobbits just can't, full stop, period, endgame and endpoint.

So what about this particular Hobbit who is literally kidnapped by shame into joining an adventure in which he is not really wanted but just opportunistically needed. But his presence is resented by some of these dwarves he is supposed to travel with and help re-conquer their own kingdom out of which they have been ousted by a fiery dragon Smaug a long time ago and are since then chased by all kinds of monsters like trolls, goblins, orcs  or whatever these monstrous monsters are.

The elves are beautiful and charming, grand and elegant, cultivated and prudent and yet they are not used to the utmost level they could have served. They are just nearly an obstacle on the road, along the way, that has to be pushed aside and then a beautiful butterfly will bring the big birds who will save the situation in its last dire strait but nothing is made as clear as it should be. We are just piling up or stringing down one event after another in some kind of pearl necklace.

Too bad because this novel by Tolkien is by far a masterpiece, but not the film, in spite of its length for just a first slice.

It reminded me of those Saturday morning action cartoons that my kids used to watch where the charactors are falling, flying through the air, tumbling downhill in one incredible fall after another with no one getting hurt or even seperated from each other.

Jackson went overboard with ""artistic license"" on this movie since a very large amount was never in the book though the part on how Thorin Oakenshield got his name was pretty original.

To put it in a nutshell, I'm very dissapponted in this movie and will not be hitting the theater next year when part 2 is released. I'll wait until someone I know buys a DVD of that one to see it because I fully expect part 2 to be as lame as part one.

4639390,5,B0059XTU1S,"The Short: Wonderfully cast, incredibly shot, relentlessly adventurous, and an (almost) spot on adaptation of the beloved classic, the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesn't disappoint in the slightest.  While it does stumble slightly in the beginning, the experience as a whole is one of the most enjoyable films of the year.  And while it does take some getting used to, the 48 FPS presentation (in 3D IMAX) is absolutely the best format to experience this journey.

4.5/5

It's been nearly a decade since we last entered Middle Earth as envisioned by Peter Jackson.  There's no denying that The Return of the King was going to be a hard act to follow.  So lets just get this straight right off the bat: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no where near the caliber of the final chapter we saw in 2003.  What The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turns out to be is an unexpected, but necessary and welcome, change to Peter Jackson's landscape of Middle Earth.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey features a memorable cast, but the standout is no doubt Martin Freeman as Bilbo.  He completely nails Bilbo's character!  Armitage is also fantastic as Thorin, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf is back again and still great.  The rest of the supporting cast is good, but only a handful of the dwarves get significant screen time.

The technical wizardry is also of note, no doubt.  It's not truly noticeable until the latter part of the movie, where the special effects are absolutely incredible.  The rest of the movie is absolutely stunning.  The battle of Erebor, the escape from the goblin stronghold, the fights with orcs; everything is incredibly animated and beautifully done.  In 48 FPS the action does take some getting used to (the higher frame rate removes the standard blur of special effects. In the higher frame rate one can see all the nuances of the special effects, making each animated character or item look ultra artificial or incredibly real), but a good 30-45 minutes into the movie and the presentation felt completely normal, and in fact made some of the later scenes look absolutely spectacular.  I can't stress enough that, once your senses have adapted, the 48 FPS visuals are unlike anything else.

Howard Shore's original score is his bet yet for sure.  Every bit of his original music captures the sweeping scale of the adventure, but it's the new theme that is still playing through my head even now.  The first time you hear the haunting new theme it will stick to you, but by the time it is blasting over action scenes it will send chills down your spine.  Original themes from TLOTR trilogy make brief returns in just the right places as well.  Overall, It's Howard Shore's best work yet.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is more of a change of scenery from the past trips to Middle Earth.  It's subject material is much lighter, the action is much more sparse, and the character building is considerably different.  And in terms of being faithful to the beloved classic, aside from the added Radagast sub-plot and the added ""white orc"" (which made more sense from a cinematic adaptation standpoint, and a change that I prefer), The Hobbit is pretty faithful to the original story.  I will admit that the beginning is sluggish and overall a little too drawn out, the Goblin King looks like he was stripped out of a video game, and there are some inconsistencies here and there. So when it comes down to it, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not perfect.  Far from it actually.  It won't win any awards.  It won't be favored among the critics.  There are some silly choices made, and it isn't the most tightly crafted piece of film.

But I could care less.

This movie is adventurous, exciting, funny, all while capturing the original essence and character of the classic novel.  The stunning special effects, great performances and incredible score make this a memorable return trip.  But what truly stands out is Peter Jackson's eye for adventure.  There just hasn't been a quality adventure movie in a long while.  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the perfect antidote.  It's big, epic filmmaking with a purpose: to tell a story (albeit the long winded way) that's grand in scale rooted deep within its characters.  Make time to see this movie, and go into it with excitement, because The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great deal of fun and makes one thing inevitable above all else: the wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is going to be incredibly painful.

4.5/5 - while flawed, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is tremendously entertaining.",1356048000,9,4611,4.810673443456163
4639391,4,B0059XTU1S,"Fantasy films aren't really my thing, however, my mother who happens to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan loves this movie. I have to give the movie props for the cinematography. I mean, oh my goodness, the visuals are beautiful!! All of the images are so clear and crisp, I literally felt like I was right there with Bilbo. I especially love the Elf kingdom and the graphics for that are amazing. I can't even explain with words how beautiful the imagery and 3D are in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. There are a few things that bothered me about the visuals though. Some of it is almost too perfect and too clear. You can see every piece of grass in the field and every pore or drop of sweat on the dwarfs. It is a bit too much. The other thing that pulled me away from the movie is how the Orcs look. They look like video game characters and they don't have the same quality of the rest of the CGI in the film.

My favorite character in The Hobbit is, by far, Gollum. Even though he is only in one scene of this movie, he is really funny in a creepy way. I really want to go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings just to see more of him! I also like Bilbo Baggins because everyone doubts him, but he never gives up or turns back. My favorite scene is a toss up between when Bilbo meets Gollum and when the dwarfs are in the underground world of the Goblins. I love when Bilbo meets Gollum because the two of them have a very funny interaction of riddling each other. I also like when the dwarfs are escaping the Goblins because their world is underground and very rickety.

The biggest downside of this movie is the length. It is way too long in my opinion, but then again, all of the Lord of the Rings films have been very long. If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings then you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but will I see it again? No. The cinematography deserves 5 out of 5 stars but, the overall film only gets 3.5 out of 5 from me. Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",1355875200,,2003,4.107142857142857
4639392,3,B0059XTU1S,"I know I am in the minority in my opinion of Peter Jackson's new Hobbit movie, but that's okay.  I found The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey to be way overdone visually.  It was not the scenes that I felt were overdone, but the action.  Several parts of the action involved such fantastic escapes from death that they eventually got tiresome to me, because of the lack of any realism to them.  Examples include collapsing scaffolding, immediately followed by a huge goblin falling on the entire company; mountains fighting each other (""stone giants"") and every single member of the company being constantly on the edge of death but never quite falling; and a huge fight with orcs at the end which detracts from the story--the story is captivating in that there was no way for them to fight the orcs; they were completely helpless until the eagles arrived.  This movie, I felt like, tried to jam too much into an adventure, so that it didn't have the ""incidental"" enjoyment of the original story.  Instead of a set of interesting incidents like the book is, this seemed like one battle after another and like it was trying to fit in all the marginal events that go on in Middle Earth at the same time.  It wasn't nearly as enjoyable as I hoped it would be, for that reason.  I might even have lost my taste for the fantasy genre entirely if this movie were my only exposure to it.",1355875200,71,1378,4.5465587044534415
4639393,4,B0059XTU1S,"3 1/2 Stars = Very Good

As a big fan of ""the Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which I consider the best trio of films ever made, I was ecstatic to hear about a prequel trilogy in ""the Hobbit"" & that Peter Jackson was helming them! I know many don't share that point of view on this new trio of films that have read the books, but as I have not read either ""the Lord of the Rings"" or ""the Hobbit,"" it pretty much goes without saying that I'm not here to compare the movies to books, but movies to movies. So with much relish, I went to ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" today, & to be honest, I was not overwhelmed, but I was not underwhelmed either.

Yes, I went into this film reading several reviews about it, so I was not expecting the pure cinematic magic & genius of the prior films, & I didn't get that, but I got a film that may go on to classic status, but never masterpiece. Without giving a million things away about the film, I will say that there are several down falls here. For one, ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" does not have the feeling of impending doom & desperation that the first three have. It veers to far towards a children's film the first half of the movie, with to much cuteness & comedy taking place, & not enough serious content. Though it starts out pretty good in setting the story up the first 15-20 minutes, one has to wonder how the dwarves ever made it to the status of overlords? Their pretty much portrayed as something more akin to ""Snow White & the Seven Dwarves,"" as all except a couple of the dwarves are inept in their intelligence, & seem to want to just eat, drink & be merry. Here I think Jackson made the same mistake as ""Star Wars"" episodes, ""Return of the Jedi"" (discounting the final show down between Luke, Darth Vader, & the Emperor), & ""the Phantom Menace."" Jackson dummied the movie down to appeal to a young audience, taking the chance of alienating the older adult audience. Also, another mistake made in this film is that Jackson threw everything he could possibly dream up in ""Middle Earth,"" & tossed it at you like a asteroid hurdling towards you through the movie screen at the speed of light. I mean, there was two, maybe three times the variety of creatures than previous films, & just to many characters to really be able to grasp & hold on to, & feel a real connection with. There was just to much shoved into a to small time frame of space, even if the film is almost three hours long. In this respect, ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" pales before the first three films, but then again, this is a very tall order, & Jackson is proved to be human after all.

Even with all I said I didn't like about ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" there is more I liked. I really can't put a finger on it, but I feel this film will grow on me with repeated viewings. It has a great premise, & a director that is capable of taking it to greater heights with the two following films, if he fixes the mistakes made here. I do have to say the 3-D was amazing, & really made ""Middle Earth"" come to life, though in the fast moving sequences, there was some blur with the background. This will most likely be fixed & improved on. It also does not hurt that many characters from ""The Lord of the Rings"" have returned with the same actors. I look forward to their roles & the part they'll play in the future films!

All in all, this is a film that may reach classic status with me in time. It was a huge undertaking, & had almost the impossible task to live up to ""Lord of the Rings."" For the time being, I'll rate this a very good film, that you should see for yourself & make your own opinion. It is well worth the watch!",1355788800,,3672,4.24892703862661

My first impression of the movie was that it was beautiful. The settings are eye popping, lush, interesting, well lit, well costumed, and over all well done. Each scene looks like a piece of art. The colors found in the movie aren't found in nature. They are crafted to set a tone. The effect is beautiful, but not at all lifelike. But it's a fantasy, right? So who cares?

Then you sink into the story and realize that there isn't that much of it. There are a LOT of characters. With the exception of Bilbo, Galdalf, and Gollum, they have very few lines so you don't get much of a sense of who they are. There is no reason to root for them or care about their journey. There is a lot of fighting, running, and more fighting. Not a whole lot actually happens in almost 3 hours.

I had heard that the book is fully of singing and silly dwarfs. This isn't really portrayed in the movie. I was hoping it would be. There is a scene where they are in Bilbo's house where they sing and are goofy, but then they aren't. They were rude, loud, and ill-mannered before that and fighting after that, so it seems disjointed.

Not being a hard core fan or purist, I liked the inclusion of the people from LOTRs. I thought it gave the stories connection and continuity, but that was also a con. I thought the two were too much alike. They looked alike, the action was similar, the characters were similar. It felt like watching LOTR all over again. I realize that that will be a plus for some people though.

Is the CGI overdone? I have no idea. I thought it all looked fine and realistic. Is the 48 FPS a hit? Again, I couldn't tell you. The outside scenes look realer than real. You can almost see each blade of grass and wouldn't be surprised if the wind hit your face. But, there are times when the movement happens too fast for my eyes to see. I wouldn't say it's blurry exactly, but it looks different in an ineffective way.

All in all, it was okay. I watched some of the ""making of"" shorts that Jackson put out as they were in production. I wanted to love it. I wanted it to live up to its hype, but after seeing it, I can see why it wasn't nominated for awards the way LOTR was. It wasn't horrible. I don't think anyone will hate it, but it's probably more of a thrill for Tolkein fans.

UPDATE: The DVD improves with viewing. The first time I noticed the stellar acting from Serkis and the Freeman in particular. I noticed the scenery and visual beauty. The second time I was already familiar with that and could focus on the story. Not a lot happens, but having a story makes everything else that happens more enjoyable. It's still long, but hearing Richard Armitage sing the Misty Mountain song is a good way to kick off an adventure.",1355788800,5,2890,4.243636363636363
4639395,4,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, King Kong) has entered the world of J.R.R. Tolkien again and for me with a very slow start. Fran Walsh (Lord of the Rings, King Kong), Philippa Boyens (Lord of the Rings, King Kong), Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro(Pan's Labyrinth, Mimic) all helmed the screenplay and seemingly did a nice effort to capture the innocence of Bilbo Baggins if a little short on substance.

Well let's talk about the stand out performances - surprisingly Martin Freeman (who is also amazing as Dr. John Watson on the new BBC series Sherlock and Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy) did an honest and light-hearted, yet believable performance starring as the lead Hobbit, Bilbo. Martins charm and frustration as well as his curiousness of the world outside his hole was  very sincere and real.

Ian McKellen (X-Men, God's and Monsters) does what he does best, gives Gandalf a real and passionate tone and feel - making him the true wise man and leader of this band of Dwarfs and one Hobbit. Not unfamiliar with the character, Gandalf, having played him three times before, we now see a more curious and lighter side that makes him a delight to watch.

I must give a special nod to Sylvester McCoy (8th Doctor Who, El Dorado) playing Radagst. He is funny, quirky and extremely hyperactive in his efforts of saving the dwarfs and woodland creatures. Sylvester gives his total energy and passion in his performance and rides rabbits like I have never seen before.

Now my favorite scene is the scene in the film with Bilbo and Gollum who first meet and go into a battle of wits with each other. Andy Serkis (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Tin Tin), who is never on camera for Freeman's performance one-on-one because Gollum is stop-motion captured, gives a creepy and stunning performance as the once Hobbit gone bad. Andy's humor and duel personality of what Gollum represents is spot on and reminded me most of the original book itself.

The film opens with a wonderful showcase of Tolkien veteran characters Frodo and older Bilbo played masterfully by retruening performers Ian Holm (Alien, Fifth Element) and Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, 9) who both have some great scenes together that will warm your heart and memories.

Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, Captain America) is back as Elrond - head of the Elfans, Cate Blanchett (Aviator, The Missing) is back as the Elfan Galadriel and the ominous Christopher Lee (Phantom Menace, Dark Shadows) is back as the wizard Saruman, although not too prominent as of yet. (Wink, wink.)

Howard Shore's (Hugo, Doubt) score is amazing (and there is another review of his score for this film here on this site as well) and it actually evokes a lot of the feeling and passion for the friendships that develop in this film.

Hopefully the sequels, `The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' (due in 2013) and `The Hobbit: There and Back Again' (due in 2014) will do what the `Rings' trilogies did, they just became better with each successive film.

I think this is defiantly a family friendly film and has a lot of offer the in respect to keeping true to the original novel. Although, I would read the book before and after seeing the film because although the film does give you a perspective of how Peter Jackson was attempting to fill in the story for a two plus hour first film, the book has more meat and depth to it for me. (As all books usually do, of course!) I was slightly disappointed but entertained with the film overall. (However, special note that if you see this in IMAX digital, this film comes with a nine minute preview/trailer of `Star Trek Into Darkness', don't miss that. In my two screenings of `The Hobbit', both with packed sold-out houses, the audience gave more of a response to Star Trek Trailer than Bilbo Baggins. (Again, check out my Star Trek trailer review here too!)

4639396,5,B0059XTU1S,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film.  Nobody can do this kind of mythic drama like Peter Jackson and his phenomenal (and huge) crew.  I thought I would miss the characters from the previous trilogy but I fell in love with the dwarfs from their first entrance one by one into Bilbo's gorgeous home.  What a fascinating and varied group! Their song around Bilbo's fire blew me away!  Some of their adventures fighting goblins and Orcs went on a bit long in my view, but  every scene was a visual treat.  I'm not a big 3-D fan, but I found it worked in this instance without seeming like a gimmick. Also, the back story lacks the intensity of LOTR, nevertheless, it won me over and I look forward to prolonging the Tolkien journey two more years.",1355788800,4,752,4.413043478260869
4639397,1,B0059XTU1S,"About a decade ago, Peter Jackson concluded his film adaptation of J. R. R.

Tolkien actually wrote and published it almost twenty years before what would be considered the first book of the LOTR trilogy.  While the books in the trilogy were epic fantasies that dug deep into the lore established by ""The Hobbit"", the prequel was a light-hearted romp, a first footstep into a Middle Earth still taking shape in Tolkien's imagination.  It was also a short romp, only a fraction of the length of any of the sequels.  So, while fans clamored for the Extended Cuts of Jackson's original trilogy a decade ago, eating up the scenes that couldn't make it into the three-hour theatrical cuts, there's not much excuse to turn ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy of its own.

The movie starts by bridging the gap between ""The Hobbit"" and LOTR by reintroducing  Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo says he will now tell the story of his greatest adventure, and then spends several minutes relating the entire history of the dwarves to the audience before finally picking up where Tolkien chose to start, ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.""  (Since the book was in third-person, and the movie adds a first-person narrator, the line now seems a little pretentious.)  And then, instead of diving into the story, Elijah Wood wastes a few minutes of screen time with a completely unnecessary cameo as Frodo.  Only then do we finally get to meet the young Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, and reunite with Gandalf, played again by Ian McKellan.

Martin Freeman has a talent for being the everyday man who is always agitated by everyone around him, from Arthur Dent in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hitchhiker-s-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/dp/B003QSJVGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>&nbsp;to Watson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-One/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season One</a>.  And playing homebody Bilbo gives him a great opportunity to roll his eyes and look perplexed by the 12-dwarf army he finds himself surrounded by.  We meet each dwarf as they barge, one at a time, through Bilbo's front door, and then insist on singing an uninspired musical number for about two minutes as they wash Bilbo's dishes.  When it's not dwarves, it's the McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, or Christopher Lee characters from Jacksons' earlier trilogy pushing Freeman's Hobbit to the background.  Instead of showing the same reverence to the source material that made Jackson's earlier trilogy so successful, here he ignores Tolkien's main plot and instead pads the movie with a subplot involving Radagast the Brown, a character taken from elsewhere in Tolkien's writings who has no place in ""The Hobbit"", and a Necromancer, and another one involving an albino orc pursuing the dwarf leader, in order to give the new trilogy a central antagonist.  Where the novel was all about Bilbo's surprising resourcefulness, more emphasis is placed on sword and axe clashes between the dwarves and the orcs.

Also, most of the light-heartedness of the novel has been leached out in favor of making the movie feel more like an extension of the original trilogy.  While the movie is brighter and more colorful then the previous films, this just has the surprising effect of making the movie feel like one of those sequels the original director palmed off to someone else after he lost interest in the franchise, even though Jackson is still at the helm.  There are some weak attempts at humor, but rather than Tolkien's wit, the biggest laughs come from unintentional comedy from the terrible acting and writing (disappointing, since one of the co-writers this time is Guillermo del Toro, who's better than this) behind lines like ""Where there is sickness, bad things happen"" or ""If there's a key, there's a door.""

Like the previous trilogy, most of the visuals are a cross between New Zealand landscapes and CGI special effects.  Peter Jackson makes the same mistake he did with ""King Kong"", assuming the computer-heavy effects are as impressive now as they were the first time we saw them in LOTR.  Even the rain is disappointingly animated, noticeably leaving all of the actor's faces completely dry.  There is one scene worth raving about, a riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum in a dark pit.  Not only does Andy Serkis, through voice work and motion capture, remind us that he should have won an Academy Award for the role he's still great at, but the scene finally gives Martin Freeman a moment to shine.  Considering they decided to tell the story through Bilbo's perspective, it's surprising that this is the one scene that really gives the title character a central role.

At the risk of sounding like one of those snobs who always complains that the book is better, in the time it will take to watch what is sure to be a 9-hour trilogy, you could probably read Tolkien's entire book, and be much more entertained doing so.",1355702400,73,5885,5.610609480812641
4639398,5,B0059XTU1S,"I just saw ""Hobbit"" and I was VERY impressed! Below you will find the reasons why I liked this film so much, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. A successful combination of great fidelity to Tolkien's vision with some skilful alterations. In second part of LOTR (""Two Towers"") Peter Jackson allowed himself some very considerable liberties with the characters of king Theoden of Rohan and captain Faramir of Gondor, and as a consequence he harmed this one part of his great trilogy. He clearly learned his lesson and in this film, even if there are some differences between the scenario and the original book, those modification were done with a great skill, good taste and in deep respect with the general vision contained in Tolkien's books in general.

Amongst those successful modifications are a greater development of the story of Smaug's coming to Erebor, of dwarves wanderings and their wars with Orcs from Moria (those last elements are taken from original annexes to ""Lord of the Rings"") and a larger inclusion of scary and extremely creepy Dol Guldur fortress (which is only briefly mentioned in the book). There is also a longer and more dramatic chapter devoted to Great Goblin's caves, a brief but impressive look at stone giants (creatures only suggested in Tolkien's lore) and last but not least, some real screen time devoted to Radagast the Brown, an extremely odd but very, very attaching character. Radagast also shows in this film that he is definitely a force to be reckoned with and not just a sidekick - although, as Saruman venomously suggests it, he also appears to be all the time ""tripping on 'shrooms""...)))

There is also more place devoted to the White Council (with Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf present and Radagast and Cirdan absent) and those passages come in fact from the annexes to LOTR rather than from ""Hobbit"" itself. Finally, even if many good jokes are included, the general tone of this film is more serious than in the book, with the dwarves being a little less comically represented and their leader, prince Thorin Oakshield, being a much more impressive character, conserving a very great dignity and majesty even when being stuffed in a troll's bag...)))

Finally, the leader of Moria Orcs at the time of dwarves expedition is still Azog the Defiler rather than his son Bolg - but I forgive willingly Peter Jackson this change, as Azog is a really IMPRESSIVE creature! On another hand, and this is one of the very few things I found a little objectionnable, Orcs seem to not fear sunlight in this film (Goblins of Misty Mountains on another hand still fear the light of the day) - but after all it is a rather minor thing.

As you can see Peter Jackson changed the story for the needs of his ""Hobbit"" trilogy, but he did it with the greatest care and by showing this time the greatest respect to the general spirit of Tolkien's works.

2. A great mastery of the visual aspect of the film. The images of Middle Earth are breath-taking, the creatures (good and evil) are excellent and the costumes and weaponry simply perfect.

3. Gollum; All the chapter about Bilbo's meeting with Gollum is pure perfection and in this film we finally can realise how REALLY DANGEROUS this creature is!

4. Tom Troll, William Troll and Bert Troll. Hilarious and scary in the same time, their moment in the film is simply a treasure.

5. Goblins of the Misty Mountains. In this film we have a real insight into goblin's government (tyranny), administration (anarchy), strategy (mostly blunt force trauma) and communications, although the little pearl about this last point, you will have to discover by yourself...)))

6. Dwarves/elves mutual cultural shock - one of the best scenes of the film...)))

7. Music. It mostly uses the same themes than in LOTR (ex. Shire theme, Rivendell theme, Ring theme, Company theme, etc.) which gives a familiar feeling of continuity, with just enough new elements to underline the fact that we are in a different chapter of Tolkien's tales.

8. Action scenes - they are many and of excellent quality, thanks to some modifications of the story by Peter Jackson (see above). They help also to set a rather fast rhythm of events, once the initial Shire chapter is concluded. If you think that to make a trilogy out of ""The Hobbit"" Peter Jackson had to drag things and slow the events, well, think again... This is a reasonably long film but I didn't feel the time pass.

9. Actors. Unlike in LOTR II ""Two Towers"" (when he seriously blundered by casting Miranda Otto as Eowyn), in this film Peter Jackson didn't commit any mistakes in the choice of actors. Martin Freeman is more than perfect in his interpretation of Bilbo - for me, after two minutes, he WAS Bilbo - all right, OK, maybe they just should have given him ten pounds more around the waist in the first part of the trilogy, but this is just a detail. Ian McKellen is of course perfect as Gandalf. Richard Armitage as Thorin is THE revelation of this film. Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee are of course brilliant - and Cate Blanchett swept me of my feet in this film (something that didn't happen in the LOTR...).

The one objection I could have is that I didn't quite picture Balin, the friendliest of dwarves, as being that old - but this is a very minor detail.

10. Clever little details of the scenario. Peter Jackson put in the scenario some little but significant details which explain better some important questions, like why did Gandalf wanted SO MUCH to help Thorin Oakenshield in his quest and why exactly did he choose precisely Bilbo Baggins as the ""burglar"" for the Company. Those little details didn't figure in the book, but they are VERY faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's story - and it is a very precious thing...

CONCLUSION: Since attacking the LOTR Peter Jackson learned a lot in last 10 years and he put all this experience to good use in ""The Hobbit"" - and the result is immediately visible on the screen. This film is on the same very high level of quality as LOTR I and III and BETTER than LOTR II. In some aspects he even did a better job than in LOTR, because here he had to manage a Company larger than the Fellowship of the Ring (15 characters instead of 9) - and he succeeded very, very well indeed. I loved this film and I cannot wait to see ""The desolation of Smaug"".",1355702400,,6332,4.690990990990991
4639399,3,B0059XTU1S,"I can't say that was all that excited to see this prequel of sorts to the great ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I had this pang in my gut fearing this would be something on the order of George Lucas restarting the ""Star Wars"" trilogy with the silly ""Phantom Menace"" in 1999.  Fear assuaged for the most part.

This preamble begins when Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) decides to write the story of how he originally took possession of the infamous ring.  His narration leads us back to his younger self (excellent Martin Freeman) who is inexplicably recruited by the wizard Gandalf (returning Ian McKellen).  Their story is relatively simple.  They are to help the 13 survivors of the dwarf kingdom, now led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in recapturing their mountain home held by a vicious dragon.

The movie is about their journey getting there.  Naturally there are enemies in their way, real and imagined.  Not the least of which is an army of orcs and their giant wolf-like steeds.  Scary to look at, the orcs are easily picked off inside their secluded compound by the dwarfs.  I couldn't figure that one out.  The orcs also have the ability to find dwarfs using a keen sense of smell...well except when they climb up in a tree.  Another head-scratcher.

Director, writer and head honcho of all things Tolkien has the look down pat.  Although I must admit, some of the backdrops looked a little too CGI.  Perhaps the film had slowed to a point where I was just a bit too focused elsewhere.  The film does seem to ponder at times.  There is one scene when Bilbo falls down a jagged crevice in the orcs mountainous home (unscathed by the way) and first meets Gollum (the great Andy Serkis).

Sensing everyone has been waiting for Gollum to appear, Jackson lingers forever in this confrontation.  Bilbo and Gollum go through several rounds of verbal riddles, slowing everything down.  Was the 2 hour and 46 minute running time really necessary?  I don't think so.  Several characters from the ""Rings"" make brief appearances including Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Elijah Wood as Frodo.  ""The Hobbit"" will likely please many and irate others.  I'm reasonably satisfied but hope for better things to follow.

I watched this movie on an IMAX screen in 3D so didn't see the controversial faster speed film shown in standard theaters.  As is usually the case the IMAX print looks great.  The 3D isn't over done and has a natural look with plenty of depth.

BLU RAY UPDATE (12-11-13):

In preparation for the new ""Hobbit"" film soon to debut, I took another look at this first film in the franchise.  This time on Blu ray.  My original observations are solidified.  The film is yawn inducing at times and doesn't justify its running time which pushes 3 hours.  The film looks good for the most part and the acting is good.  A decent, if underwhelming, start for the series.

While I might take issue with the movie, I have none with the Blu ray version (Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet).  This movie really looks good on this disc.  The 1080p transfer includes a 2.4:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are dramatic.  Blues, browns, orange are excellent as are the blacks.  Fleshtones are excellent as well.  Detail and definition is clear and crisp.  I found no faults with the video.  This is one of the better films for demo purposes.

Speaking of demo, I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better audio track to show off either.  The disc comes with a killer DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  The producers make great use of the surrounds with plenty of thunder for the subwoofer(s).  A couple scenes to note include the section where giant eagles save the dwarves from certain doom at the hands of the orcs.  Another great use of woofers and subs is the scene where the dwarves are climbing a mountain and the mountain comes alive and becomes 2 separate ""fighters.""  While this made no sense to me, it looked and sounded great.

Extras include a look at New Zealand where the film was made, a couple hours of video blogs, and some trailers including one for games.",1355702400,4,4096,4.658741258741259
4639400,5,B0059XTU1S,"Three hours in Middle Earth pursued by orcs, pummeled by rock hurling giants, evading goblins and trolls is exhausting, but SO satisfying. The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey is close to perfect in the spirit of the book.

It's a gentler, more playful adventure than LoTR, though the perils are no less deadly.  Martin Freeman's Bilbo is marvelous--in turns petulant, vulnerable and heroic, and his evolution from complacent comfort-seeker to resourceful rescuer is wonderful to watch.

As good as Freeman is, Andy Serkis steals the movie.  The riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum is some of the most riveting screen time ever. Serkis SO deserves a Major Award (not a leg lamp) for his tormented, schizophrenic Gollum.  That scene alone makes this movie a must see.  All the acting is splendid and cameos from LotR characters preserve the continuity of the story, but somehow The Hobbit manages to be more FUN than was LotR.

If at all possible, see it in 3-D. The only thing missing is smell, but after Bilbo's and Thorin's reaction to essence de goblin, that's OK. Peter Jackson never ceases to amaze, and The Hobbit is a must see.  I can't wait for the next installment!",1355616000,6,1174,4.85929648241206
4639401,4,B0059XTU1S,"Ever since ""The Lord of the Rings"" ended, fans have been clamoring for ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted as well.

Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first part of a trilogy of ""Hobbit"" movies. It has some few flaws, but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.

Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...

At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.

It took me two viewings of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd, and the second time I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.

Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of ""The Hobbit"" (plus chunks of ""Unfinished Tales"") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.

And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. It's brilliant.

He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.

However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.

But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.

And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast!

The comedy can be a bit grating, but ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.",1355616000,6,3936,5.047765793528505
4639402,4,B0059XTU1S,"I love the Lord of the Rings books and movies, and so first and foremost, as a huge fan, this movie is a wonderful return visit to the fantasy world of Tolkien's Middle Earth.  But the process of watching the movie proved to be a chore as it became apparent that Sir PJ (Peter Jackson) had burdened this movie with some terrible film making decisions.

First the good parts - Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage, the key new actors playing the young Bilbo and Thorin Oakenshield, are outstanding!!  Andy Serkis does another fabulous turn as the twisted and tortured Gollum - his scenes with Martin Freeman playing the riddle game are worth the price of admission/DVD/BluRay alone!!  Ian McClellan is wonderful as always as Gandalf, and Cate Blanchett has never been so lustrous and beautiful as the elf queen Galadriel.  Ian Holm as the older Bilbo, Elijah Woods as Frodo, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond all make reassuring reappearances.  (Christopher Lee's reappearance as Saruman is a bit redundant).  Manu Bennett (Crixus the gladiator in the Spartacus series) does a fine job as Azog the pale Orc.

The many, many battle scenes in this movie are awesome.

The back stories of the dwarves, how they lost their kingdom under the mountains and how their enmity with the elves began, is told in rich detail, one of the key benefits to  ""The Hobbit"" getting stretched out into three parts.

So what were the bad parts about the movie? And how could anybody accuse Sir PJ of bad film making?

The bad part of stretching a small book like The Hobbitt out like this clearly are the slow and overly long padded parts such as the introduction of the dwarves  and Radagast the Brown's long segment.

However, the biggest complaint of many movie critics has been how cheesy and unnatural this movie looks.  Nobody so far has clearly explained why, so here is my analysis.

I watched this movie in 3D IMAX in 48fps.  Very simply, 48fps is a fine technology - it makes everything much clearer, and cleaner and does not make you vomit.  People who do not understand film making technology have unfairly blamed the many technical ills of this movie on 48fps.  It is NOT the culprit.

The real culprit, what did make my stomach churn (and I do not get sick easily from watching movies with jittery camerawork) was Sir PJ's excessive use of camera motion in the vast majority of scenes in this movie.  Even simple close up shots of individuals engaged in conversation were framed by unnecessary dipping and panning camera movements!!!

This was not the jittery handheld camera motion of documentary style movies like the Blair Witch Project.  These were PLANNED camera moves, done for stylistic purpose, no more.  Terrible, awful film maker's choice.

What made this worse was the fact that these excessive, often useless camera movements appeared to be SPEEDED UP, as if somebody had hit the ""fast forward"" button on the movie all of a sudden and it was playing at 2x or 4x normal speed during those camera moves.

Indeed, I suspect that what may have happened was that as Sir PJ realized that this movie was going to end up at nearly 3 hours long and that he had ONLY SHOT some of his key scenes with this extra camera movement,  that he needed to speed things up a bit and so he probably did fast forward through those scenes with the camera moves.

Another problem  I started to notice - the digital lighting effects.  In previous DVD/BluRays, Sir PJ and his minions had explained their extensive use of digital post processing to enhance and correct for the unevenness of their filming, especially lighting effects.  With ""The Hobbit"" captured entirely by ultra-high resolution digital cameras, the end movie appears to have been post-processed to the max.

The excessiveness of the post-processing, this attempt to make every scene appear digitally picture postcard ""perfect"" becomes apparent when viewing the scenes as a whole.  The scenes end up looking completely unnatural in appearance, very similar in ""look"" to what you get with TV soap operas, which are typically shot indoors in studio sets with multiple soft light sources that eliminate shadows,  poorly lit dark areas, overly bright reflections, and imperfect colors.

As a result, very strangely, the most plastic and fake looking scenes in this move were the Hobbiton outdoor scenes, which were all filmed outdoors, on real, naturally created sets, and yet looked like an indoor TV studio set BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SHADOWS ANYWHERE AND THE DIGITALLY PERFECT LIGHTING WAS PERFECTLY DIFFUSE.  I noticed this as I was watching the movie and started looking for shadows in those scenes.  When I couldn't find any, I looked at the sky to see if there were a heavy dark total overcast of clouds blotting out the sun, but no, the sky was blue and bright.  And look carefully at Gandalf in every outdoor scene - wearing his broad brimmed hat, his face should always be in the shadows, and yet invariably, his face is unnaturally and brightly lit by a magical and cartoonish lighting while the bottom of his hat sits in total darkness.

Sir PJ's  technical choices for this movie were clearly made with a film maker's zeal to do more, not to make a cheesy looking made-for-TV movie.  But combined together, they have the opposite effect.

The excessive amounts of digital post processing for lighting, combined together with the excessive cartoonish fast forwarded camera movements, are what most make the movie look CHEESY and poorly crafted, despite all the high tech 48fps and outstanding motion capture and other high level attention to detail and special effects.

It is little wonder that some of the best parts of the movie are where the camera director and post processing digital editor were throttled,  leaving us with fairly still, or simple slowly panning/soaring movements, as well a natural lighting.  It is in these scenes that all the beautiful visuals of this movie get their chance to shine through and take hold in our brains and allow us to immerse ourselves back into the world of Middle Earth.",1355529600,2,6059,4.828488372093023
4639403,3,B0059XTU1S,Keeping this review as simple as possible... Not even close to being as good as The Lord of the Rings movies but good nevertheless.  Really slllloooooowwww at times.  We know it's one book being stretched in to three movies. Unfortunately this movie felt thin.  Without Gollum I don't think I'd of liked it.,1355529600,4,307,4.754716981132075
4639404,5,B0059XTU1S,"I was most impressed not by Bilbo, Gandalf or the Dwarfs, but by the Brown Wizard, who is one of the Five Great Wizards of Middle Earth. Not only does he save Gandalf and the dwarfs in one incredibly brilliant move while driving a sled pulled by jackrabbits but he also fearlessly protects all life in his forest. As a solitary wizard, with only animals as his companions, he is literally a guardian angel. He is also on the front lines. Some mysterious evil force is invading his forest. He has real power and he's not afraid to use it to heal or repel evil! Tolkien was obviously an ardent environmentalist & conservationist and I'm so glad this version of The Hobbit makes that perfectly clear!

One of my other favorite scenes is when Gandalf compares his approach to combating great evil with Saruman's. I'm paraphrasing here, but Gandalf believes to fight great evil it's an accumulation of small acts of kindness and the power of compassion that in the end will triumph over great evil. While Saruman believes only great power can defeat great evil. Gandalf and Saruman's approach to combating evil are as opposite as day is to night! We all know from The Lord of the Rings who's philosophy was right in the end!

4639405,5,B0059XTU1S,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is great! This is how the story goes: Bilbo Baggins, who is swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome Dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the Wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of 13 Dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild, through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins, Orcs and deadly Wargs, as well as a mysterious and sinister figure known only as the Necromancer.

Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain, first they must escape the Goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever...Gollum.

Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ""precious"" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities...A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.

The cast led by Ian McKellen (as Gandalf) & Martin Freeman (as Bilbo Baggins) is great. The directing by Peter Jackson (also wrote the screenplay & produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien) by Jackson, Fran Walsh (also produced), Philippa Boyens (also produced) & Guillermo del Toro is great.

The music by Howard Shore is great. The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie is great. The film editing by Jabez Olssen is great. The casting by Victoria Burrows, Amy Hubbard, John Hubbard, Liz Mullane & Miranda Rivers is great. The production design by Dan Hennah is great. The art direction by Simon Bright, Andy McLaren & Ben Milsom is great. The set decoration by Ra Vincent, set designs by Isadore William Crooks, Jenny Hitchcock, John Lott, Mark Stephen & Gavin Urquhart, set dressings by Colin Elms, Rosie Guthrie & Gillian West-Walker is great. The costume design by Bob Buck, Ann Maskrey & Richard Taylor is great. The prosthetic make-up effects supervised by Tami Lane is great. The special effects coordinated by Phil McLaren & Paul Verrall is great. The visual effects supervised by Matt Aitken, Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon, Kevin Andrew Smith & R. Christopher White is great. The stunts coordinated by Tim Wong (also coordinated the fights), Desiree Rose Cheer, Augie Davis, James O'Donnell & Paul Shapcott is great.

This is a great and well-made film that is just about in line with the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. Peter Jackson has made another great film that is visually entertaining and interesting. Martin Freeman does an interesting job as Bilbo Baggins. This is one of the best movies of the holiday season.",1355529600,,2765,4.989154013015185
4639406,3,B0059XTU1S,"There's been a lot written both positive and negative about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", but most of it misses the point.  All the talk about CGI and 48 fps and pacing and running time and the inclusion of material from Tolkien's other works is interesting, but the core problem is that the movie simply can't overcome taking about 25 minutes worth of plot and stretching it into a movie running 2 hours and 49 minutes.  It's a shame since there are some sit-up straight moments during those 25 minutes, but unfortunately the exercise doesn't fully succeed.  3 stars.

It is a fantastic treat for fans that Peter Jackson decided to return to the world of Middle Earth and explore it a little more.  Unexpected Journey is not an awful film - it's certainly not Phantom Menace, which is what it will likely be compared to by some detractors - but it is not a great one either.

For those familiar with the book, the movie covers about a third of it, up to the pinecone tree battle.  Part of Jackson's problem here is that in the narrative, not all that much happens during that time.  More than anything else, the company is more or less just moving around, walking in on random parts of Middle Earth while on the way to visit Smaug.

Jackson attempts to make a movie out of this in three ways.  First, he brings in elements of Tolkien's later work, building on the rise of Sauron and what characters from the later books are doing during the Hobbit.  This is actually a pretty reasonable adaptation; the cameos of Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond are worthwhile, and the addition of Radagast is slightly silly but still interesting.  (It also makes for a great inside joke about the Blue wizards for those familiar with what Tolkien wrote.)  Sauron's presence isn't written about in the Hobbit, but Jackson's decision to include how his rise begins here makes sense.

The other two ways create more problems.  First, he drastically embellishes the tale of what ends up being a composite of Azog and Bolg from the Hobbit, making him into the main antagonist and creating numerous plot devices around him.  Second, he turns the tangential coming-of-age tale of the overall Hobbit into a direct coming-of-age tale of Bilbo gaining the acceptance of a distrustful Thorin.

Most of these latter two story lines come through battle sequences, and the problem is that Jackson ends up filling much of the movie with them.  Unfortunately, this progresses to the point where it the repeated CGI sequences end up almost boring as they merely act as filler for the rest of the plot not advancing.  In doing so, Jackson seems to have missed why adapting the Battle of Helm's Deep as the central plot element in The Two Towers worked so well.  Non-canon characters and story fit perfectly well when they tie together loose ends and advance the main plot.  When they and their battles basically become the main plot as they do for the better part of 2 hours here, any movie would suffer.

The saving grace of the movie is the few scenes that do advance the plot.  The one gem in the entire movie that equals the quality with the original trilogy is the riddle sequence between Gollum and Bilbo, where Serkis and Freeman nail the most important sequence in the entire prequel.  If the rest of the movie lived up to that quality, this would have been fantastic.

Finally, as far as the 48 fps debate, it's overblown.  The simple way to think of it is like watching a 120 Hz or 240 Hz TV with upconverting and smoothness on; the video quality improves dramatically, but it feels much like watching a video instead of TV.  It's probably worth watching in 48 fps for the novelty of doing so, but not much more than that.

Jackson's source material is a bit more robust for the next two films, so it'll be interesting to see what he comes up with.  However, the bottom line remains that if he wants to make a three hour movie, he'll need three hours of plot material next time.  3 stars.",1355529600,15,3971,4.599431818181818
4639407,3,B0059XTU1S,"Not even in the Hobbit book, but pretty much saved the movie from being a complete snooze fest.  We've already seen orcs (not depicted although vaguely mentioned in the book), we've seen Galadriel (not depicted in the book), we've seen Saruman (ditto); we've seen giant eagles (in the book but not until the end), giant spiders (ditto) and the Sting (ditto).  And although we hadn't seen trolls in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (or did we?  I think I spotted some in the dark army in ""Return of the King""?), there was nothing scary or funny or remotely interesting about them.

As for the company of dwarves, their depiction here is something like a cartoon Braveheart.  My gut reaction was, ""Trust Tolkien (Anglo-Saxon snob) to give the boorish creatures Scottish accents"", then I remembered - he didn't.  Peter Jackson and his company of screenwriters did.  How cliche'.

No, I wasn't looking at my watch after the first ten minutes, really I wasn't.  I was looking at my lap because the 48 bit frame rate made the sweeping landscapes blurry and headache-inducing.

Spoiler alerts:  How do you turn a single volume whimsical childrens' story into a 9 hour trilogy of films?  By stretching  every  single  scene  out  a  very  very  long  time  and then putting in a bunch of stuff from other Tolkien books and other movies based on other Tolkien books and...well, a whole lot of other stuff you just made up!  With all the CGI tricks in the world at his disposal, Jackson could not make Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett look younger?

4639408,5,B0059XTU1S,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a unique film that appears to obviously stir the concept of benevolent forces colliding with malevolent elements.  ""Ian Mckellen"" returns  in the pivotal role of  Gandalf the Grey. He persuasively plays the wizard who strives to foster unity among Bilbo Baggins and the company of dwarves.  Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth, Ponyo,Hanna) and Hugo Weaving (the Matrix films, Captain America, Cloud Atlas) also play important roles with the characters of Galadriel and Elrond. The artistic detail of the orcs and goblins are done in a one of a kind fashion, but I admit that they also remind me a little of some of the villain characters from my husband's World of Warcraft computer game. Many of the characters played an integral part to the plot of this film. However, two of my personal favorite characters were that of Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) and Thorin Oakenshield (played by Richard Armitage). They both seem to be two sides of the same spiritual coin and challenge each other in way that brings out their spiritual growth. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is great for those who enjoyed any of the Lord Rings trilogies or like fantasy movies.",1355529600,8,1199,4.98

The acting by Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellan as Gandalf and all the dwarves were great. The man and voice behind Gollum also has a memorable 10 minutes of screen time. The CGI is of the highest calibur, but I did miss the real make-up effects used for the Orcs in LOTR (almost all the faces and bodies of the Orcs are pure CGI here). I think many critics are being far to harsh, though the majority still liked it. This is much smaller in scale than the LOTR, but its is still filled with wonderful characters, action, music and another amazing quest we will have to wait another two years to complete.

I'm glad Mr. Jackson has the opportunity to create as a director instead of giving to'movie studio dictatorship'.

4639411,3,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit does seem to spend too much time in added scenes from Tolkein's appendices and in trying to connect The Hobbit to Lord of the Rings. Some will not mind this and even enjoy it. But it comes at the expense of getting around to telling the story of The Hobbit as told in the book.  There was an extended period in the first hour or so where I considered seriously walking out of the theater and not finishing the movie. It just simply seemed to not want to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins. The film could easily have been retitled ""The Dwarves"" because that seemed to be the focus along with the emphasis on connecting it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The film gives Bilbo a great line at the end which finally gives him purpose and is heart warming. But takes the back seat to the Dwarves and the appendices material until the final act. I agree with the critics. The film feels bloated.

There was no way I was not going to see this film in 48FPS HFR. Unfortunately my final verdict is that it probably hurt the presentation by sometimes hurting and sometimes helping. Which begs the question why see a film which sometimes looks great and sometimes looks kinda bad when you can see it look real good all the way through. Being there for history seems the best reason. But if you don't care about that see it in 2D 24 because this film suffers from the sense of watching it with sunglasses. Some 3D films do, some don't. But this one feels too gray with 3D glasses on.

Jackson's choice of 48 frames per second is the right one because the images are very crisp and there is literally no blurring during action scenes at all. Its pretty amazing how sharp the images look. As to those who have read The Hobbit, you already know that you are in for a great movie because so many great parts are in the first third of the book. Jackson's decision to make The Hobbit into three movies was the right one because they are able to stay extremely faithful to the book and add a few things that were a pleasant surprise. The scene when Bilbo and Gollum play a game of riddles is mesmerizing and the best scene in the movie. That scene puts the movie over the top and from that point on, your in for one hell of a ride. Andy Serkis definitely deserves some Oscar recognition for his portrayal of Gollum. The filmmakers use motion capture to capture Serkis' performance and it is a brilliant one.

It contains an Ultraviolet version, which means a copy streamed from the internet and frankly a less convenient and popular way to watch digital movies. So, don't buy this expecting to be able to get a digital copy for your iTunes account.

First, a disclaimer:

I saw this movie in 3D in 48 frames per second. I had wanted to see it in non-3D at the regular 24 fps, but the tickets for that show were already sold out (even though the one I saw started a half hour earlier - I guess everybody else wanted to see the regular version too). In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).

With that said, here are some of my thoughts:

STORY/BOOK ADAPTATION

I'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.

***SPOILERS AHEAD***

The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).

Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.

My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.

I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.

Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb, with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.

Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.

***END SPOILER ALERT***

As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.

CHARACTERS/ACTING

I generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the ""Took"" (adventurous) and ""Baggins"" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.

With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.

I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.

The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.

I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

Generally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.

However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.

The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.

OVERALL

The Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor.",1355443200,4,8661,4.651832460732984
4639415,5,B0059XTU1S,"This movie is FREAKING AMAZING!!! I was getting really worried before going to see it because of some negative reviews, but there is nothing to worry about. If you loved the Lord of the Rings movies, especially the extended editions, then you will love The Hobbit too!

A little bit about me: I grew up on the animated movies, read the books when I was in sixth grade, and have reread them several times over the years. I'm a HUGE fan, but not a ""purist"", and saw each of the live action films several times in the theaters. I took a class on Tolkien in college (and knew more about the books than even the teacher lol), went to view the original manuscripts at Marquette University in Milwaukee twice, and borrowed most of the History of Middle Earth books from the library but just skimmed them. I'm pretty familiar with much of the appendices/deleted chapters/abandoned attempts at revising The Hobbit and sequelizing Lord of the Rings, etc.

I've been waiting for The Hobbit since 2003, and have been following the production online. When it was announced 5 months ago that Peter Jackson was splitting the story into 3 films (after already completing production on the 2-film adaptation), my heart sank. It's not that I was opposed to turning The Hobbit into a trilogy (despite that it's meant to be a children's story and not an epic), but I just didn't think there was enough story and it seemed like a cash grab that would probably destroy the pacing. But, Peter Jackson hasn't let me down before and so I held out hope. In fact the more I heard him talk about giving the dwarves a bit more character development and backstory and adding in all the stuff about the White Council, I began to look forward to it.

When a couple weeks ago reviews starting coming in saying that, as I had first feared, the movie dragged and the pacing was terrible, I prepared myself for disappointment. Even though hardcore fans on messageboards like theonering.net who had seen the movie early kept saying it was terrific, the negative reviews from professional critics kept coming in. The movie is ""bloated"" and ""dull"" and ""misses the point"", they said. And so I was VERY nervous going to see the movie this afternoon.

I'm pleased to say that not only is the movie incredible, but it's on par with the Lord of the Rings movies. I haven't felt this way about a movie since Fellowship of the Ring 10 years ago. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it all night, and I can't wait till I can go see it again. I sat in the theater for nearly three hours with the biggest grin on my face the entire time. The movie didn't feel bloated or stretched thin to me. I was worried that there would be all these scenes that went on too long or belonged on the cutting room floor, but I can't think of anything I would have left out. It was like watching the book acted out on the screen in front of me with really great acting, music, and production values.

The cinematography has really improved in the last 10 years! Wow this movie is beautifully shot! Howard Shore's music is once again great, though there are some little deletions and changes from the Original Soundtrack -- the only one that really bugged me though was the use of the Nazgul theme over Thorin fighting Azog. There was better music there in the Original Soundtrack and changing it was a horrible decision.

I love the added stuff with the White Council/Necromancer. It's all there in Tolkien's appendices and in ""Unfinished Tales"", and (blasphemy for saying so) depending on how this continues to play out over the next two movies I may end up liking this even better than the book! Either the next film or the one after that will have the Battle of Dol Goldur and, from what I've heard, we will see Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and Galadriel battling werewolves and giant spiders as they try to drive out the Necromancer. I can just imagine how awesome that will be if Peter Jackson pulls it off!

And, yes, this felt to me like a complete movie. One of the reasons I originally hated the idea of a trilogy was I expected to feel short changed by only seeing a small fraction of the story and then having to wait another year. But I felt like there was plenty of story and they got into plenty of adventures.

My only nitpicks are few: I liked the design of the Great Goblin but I thought he acted way too cartoony. My other is there were a couple times where Bilbo and the dwarves fell from a height of like 500 feet and just got back up. They would have been killed. I also thought the character Azog was fine, but why did he have to be all CGI? Why couldn't it have been an actor in makeup like Lurtz in Fellowship of the Ring? Those are really my only nitpicks though.

As I sat in the theater I had a feeling like this is one of the best filmgoing experiences I've ever had. I had the same feeling watching Lord of the Rings. As someone who originally hated the idea of making this into a trilogy, now I say bring it on!!!

UPDATE: I got to see the movie in 48 frames per second (HFR 3D) yesterday. I had only seen it in regular 24fps 3D before. 24fps has been the standard for film since the Silent movie days. The Hobbit is the first movie to be shot at 48fps to give it a sharper look. Unfortunately the technology is new so only a few theaters are equipped to even show it at 48fps. Many of the reviewers were saying they hated it, that it looks like a BBC TV movie. I was still curious to give it a try because it's new technology and it's how Peter Jackson intended you to see the movie, but I didn't want it to distract from my first viewing if I ended up not liking it, so we saw the movie first at 24fps 3D.

Anyway, I liked it and I didn't think it looked ""cheap"" or like a ""soap opera"" at all. It looked really sharp and there were some parts where the people looked like they were really right in front of you. In addition to that, motion blur is completely gone now and I've heard from other people who get headaches from watching 3D movies that they were fine watching this one, thanks to the 48fps.

Peter Jackson has confirmed that there WILL be an extended edition dvd/blu ray like they did with the Lord of the Rings movies. So you may want to hold out from buying the theatrical dvd when it comes out and get the extended edition.",1355443200,"1,239",6310,4.36999147485081
4639416,5,B0059XTU1S,"I have four words for you: Erebor, Thranduil, Rivendell, and Elrond. (In order of appearance, of course!)

This movie was absolutely gorgeous. Costumes, effects, design, everything was amazing. The Radagast sections didn't need to be quite so long but I do appreciate that PJ's trying to get the Dol Goldur/Necromancer bits in. Similarly, Galadriel's comments about Angmar and Rhudaur probably will be incomprehensible to the average watcher but they do hold a deeper significance. (Elrond's 'watchful peace' comment, anyone?)

You can tell where the scenes slow a bit - in a more 'taking our sweet time telling the story' fashion - but it does take some energy from the Lord of the Rings in its battle scenes. It is a fresher, younger look at the world of Middle-Earth between Morgoth and Sauron and the environments and attitudes of the characters reflect that. Each dwarf manages to be unique (Bofur turned out to be my favorite, honestly, for his frank oddness) and makes an impact, and McKellen and Freeman are fantastic. There's a very Arthur Dent air about Bilbo, but it works wonderfully.

I hadn't expected Thranduil in this movie, so his appearance nearly sent me into a faint.

This is a MUST SEE.",1355443200,136,1208,4.935960591133005
4639417,5,B0059XTU1S,"I previously wrote a much more negative review of this movie but I didn't think it was entirely fair; I saw it in 48 FPS and the accelerated frame rate was so distracting that I had a really hard time following the story. Today I saw it in 2D and enjoyed the film much more. So with that said:

Cons:

Luckily, most of the flaws with this movie are in the 48 fps version. 48 fps makes a lot of the CGI effects look cheap, plus it makes the characters appear to sporadically speed up, like you accidentally hit the fast forward button. The landscape shots are great (as expected), but I also felt like I was watching a documentary.

Aside from my 48 fps complaints, I felt like Peter Jackson used more CGI than he had to. I think most (if not all) of the orcs and all of the goblins were CGI this time around, rather than people in costumes (like in the LOTR movies). This isn't a huge complaint, it's just that when I think LOTR orcs, I don't think of the ones in The Hobbit, kind of video gamey. The stone trolls weren't done very well either, kind of like low budget transformers.

While the music is great in this movie, a lot of it is recycled from the previous trilogy. While subtle nods to LOTR musically are to be expected, I didn't expect ""Ok, this is where Galadriel makes her first appearance, cue ""Lothlorien"" off the Fellowship soundtrack!"" and ""Bilbo found the ring, cue the mournful violin solo from the trilogy!"" I feel like the ""blunt the knives and chip the plates"" song and ""misty mountains cold"" song felt a bit out of place, but I think with repeat viewings i'll get behind it a bit more.

Pros:

Considering that they are splitting The Hobbit into 3 movies AND adding stuff from the appendices as well as fleshing out things that Tolkien only hinted at in his books, the team did a bang up job with this film. They spun the story so there was a (greater) focus on Bilbo's transformation. With so many characters and storylines keeping Bilbo at the center was difficult, but they (more or less) pulled it off. The dwarves in the books (aside from Thorin) weren't really developed too well and I really like that all thirteen dwarves have their own personality in the film. Granted, An Unexpected Journey didn't get to give all the dwarves a chance to shine, but that's what the other two movies are for.

The casting and acting is spot on as well. Martin Freeman does an excellent job as Bilbo. Gandalf and Thorin are great as well. I was a little worried about Radagast (who of course wasn't in The Hobbit) but they added him in well. He's a bit kooky, but not overly so (I read one review where he compared Radagast to Jar Jar Binks...ridiculous). Gollum is a tad different in this movie than the trilogy, there's a touch more humor in his arguments with himself (which I think works very well), the whole riddles in the dark scene is great. Overall, plot-wise, no complaints.

Bottom line, it's great to be back in Middle Earth, but lightning doesn't strike twice. I definitely liked An Unexpected Journey, but nothing in it really ""wowed"" me, and I guess I was hoping for a similar experience to when I first viewed LOTR. I would definitely recommend going to see this, just not in the high frame rate.",1355443200,2,3226,4.4375
4639418,4,B0059XTU1S,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is loaded with so many spectacular scenes that I will want to see again.  The whole goblin battle that makes up the final third of the movie has so many individual awe-inspiring moments within it that the entertainment value of the movie is justified by that alone.  I saw The Hobbit:AUJ in IMAX 3D, and found this to be the best use of the 3D format I've seen since Avatar, though not quite at the same high level.  Both interior and exterior scenes really come alive.  Story-wise, it's been awhile since I read the book, but this movie doesn't seem to follow what I remember all that well -- not that it mattered too much to me, as I maintained interest throughout.  Only the early part of the movie felt too long, the section set in Bilbo's hobbit-hole (house), with Gandalf and the dwarves.  That definitely could have been cut in half and it only would have made TH:AUJ better. Finally, to those critics who are saying variations of ""more of the same"" in their reviews, maybe I'm too much of a LOTR nerd, but I won't ever complain about a new look into Peter Jackson's vision of Tolkein's world!",1355443200,2,1134,4.507317073170731
4639419,4,B0059XTU1S,"In his return to Middle-Earth, eight years after his concluding installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson once again adapts a beloved Tolkien novel for the silver screen. In this prequel, the first of three films, we accompany a band of dwarves, along with an unwilling Bilbo Baggins, on their journey to reclaim their homeland.

On it's own, An Unexpected Journey is a majestic and fantastical tale that will be sure to please audiences of all ages. The action is thrilling and the story is full of humor and light-heartedness. The cinematography is everything you would expect from a Jackson film; sweeping landscapes, elaborate set pieces, and an incredible sense of grandeur. The film is incredibly fun and is a welcome return to Middle-Earth. Martin Freeman is terrific as our little hero, and I'm incredibly glad he was cast in the role. Each returning cast member reprises their role masterfully, particularly Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and the new actors fit into their roles quite nicely.

However, for me, compared with the Lord of the Rings saga, The Hobbit didn't quite meet the expectations I had. Perhaps they were already impossibly high because of my love for the Rings trilogy, but the film just didn't give me the sense of shock and awe I was hoping for. The film's pace drags a bit, especially the first forty minutes or so, but I can't criticize that too much as there's a lot of backstory to cover and a lot of characters to introduce. Also, the movie is incredibly CGI intensive; almost to the point that it took me out of the movie. I understand there was a lot of CGI in the Rings films but this just felt a little over the top.

It was great to get reacquainted with some of the characters I've come to love, particularly Gandalf and especially Gollum, who's game of riddles scene with Bilbo is easily the best in the film. I'm not entirely sold on Jackson's persistence on making three films, as I think the story could have been told in two, but I'll continue to trust in him. It may be unfair to compare this film with the Lord of the Rings films, but the fact is we wouldn't have this movie if it weren't for the trilogy. Had The Hobbit been made before the Rings series, perhaps it would have blown me away more.",1355443200,2,2258,4.584158415841584
4639420,3,B0059XTU1S,"The last time out Peter Jackson did everything right. First he started with a great book(s), and then he carefully crafted a screenplay which stayed remarkably true to the source. In New Zealand he found the perfect location which he capitalized on with stunning cinematography. Most significantly he used the technological wizardry of computer generated imagery to great advantage. No doubt about it, The Lord of The Rings trilogy could never have been brought to film without CGI, but in Jackson's deft hands the CGI was never the main attraction. The CGI was always used in service of the story, never the other way around. This time Jackson did all of the important stuff wrong. Admittedly with The Hobbit Jackson has started with a lesser book, but instead of using his vision to elevate the original, he has succumbed to greed and diluted it. There is no other justification for reinterpreting a relatively short novel as a trio of full length movies. In order to fill all of that extra screen time Jackson had to write lots of extra material, and so he has strayed from his greatest initial achievement. He has failed to stay true to the book. As with the previous trilogy, the cast of this new series is strong and the location is stunning, but unlike his Lord of The Rings trilogy this interpretation of The Hobbit is just a weak excuse for one special effect after another. This time the CGI does not serve the story, it is the story. In Jackson's hands Tolkien's Hobbit has been reimagined as a non-stop roller coaster ride of successively ridiculous action scenes. The only thing missing was Johnny Depp.",1355443200,11,1616,4.775
4639421,5,B0059XTU1S,Early screenings show this film is worthy of the cinematic majesty of Peter Jackson's first trilogy. Prepare to be blown away by its brilliance. Bravo Peter and company!!!,1355356800,3,171,5.142857142857143
4639422,4,B0059XTU1S,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is the first film in a new trilogy that takes place before ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Peter Jackson returns to direct and a few familiar faces also make the journey back to Middle-earth not only in ""An Unexpected Journey,"" but will be popping up throughout the three new films. Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis revisit the beloved Tolkien characters in this film alone and special effects are again handled by Weta Workshop and Weta Digital. ""An Unexpected Journey"" is set 60 years before ""The Lord of the Rings"" and follows a young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) as he's recruited by Gandalf (McKellen) to be a burglar of sorts and assist Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and 12 of his dwarf brethren as they set out on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain and retrieve it from the dragon Smaug so Thorin can finally become king.

Seeing this in 3D and in 48 frames per second is incredibly different from the typical movie going experience. 48 frames per second takes some getting used to. Character movements and action sequences look sped up; almost like someone pressed fast forward on a VCR and forgot to press play. But then somebody starts talking and you realize that that is part of how it was filmed. Everything is just as rich in detail as you'd come to expect from these films, but it seems slightly enhanced compared to 9-11 years ago. It's not just because digital technology has improved since then either. Scenery looks like finely crafted paintings and simple things like the line of every stone, every strand of hair, and every thread of fabric is brought to life. These entities and these motions move and come to life in ways you never imagined.

This may be the most efficient use of the 3D effect all year. Spit, broken teeth, and arrows all fly into your face as flaming pine cones are practically thrown into your lap. The feathers of the wings of giant birds seem to brush against your cheek. The special effects are outstanding and are as crisp and smooth as the most impressive video game cut scenes. Weta has always been a few steps ahead of the average special effects company with Industrial Light & Magic being a very close second, but Weta seems to have outdone themselves yet again. Animated characters are even smoother than they were in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" they're more fluid, and textures are more detailed. Everything is just more polished overall.

The new technology mostly works to the prequel's benefit, but there are a few setbacks. ""An Unexpected Journey"" is incredibly slow for the first 45 minutes or so, especially when you have to sit through the dwarves eating all of Bilbo's food, throwing plates around, belching, smoking, and singing. There's little to settle into at first other than Ian McKellen slipping back into the Gandalf role with ease as his body language and a slight curl of his upper lip say more about the character than the things that came out of his mouth half of the time. Meanwhile, Martin Freeman brings a little lighthearted humor to the Bilbo role. Even with him being so humble, modest, soft-spoken, and completely gutless, he's still quite humorous as are his interactions with just about everyone. With the slow pace in the first quarter of the film though, the 48 frames per second doesn't really work all that well. Things not only look weird at first, but the intricate details seem to reveal too much. Most of the set pieces and costume designs are revealed in this light that has the film come off as a glorified version of ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" or ""Xena: Warrior Princess;"" that is until you get used to it and the film picks up.

The epic fantasy adventure doesn't really pick up until Dwalin (Ken Stott) tells the story of the pale orc. Shortly after, the trolls are introduced who have this ""Three Stooges"" mentality to them, are simpletons, and argue about how to cook everything. The troll interactions with the dwarves and Bilbo is not only exciting, but fairly amusing as well. From there, they travel to Rivendell where you see some more familiar faces, get caught in the middle of a stone giant battle that is quite the spectacle, and are eventually lead underground and have some really impressive sequences with goblins. Bilbo gets separated from the group and interacts with Gollum. Andy Serkis is really at the top of his game because Gollum's facial expressions alone are extraordinary and the entire game of riddles sequence is really entertaining.

""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway. It doesn't always accelerate when it should, but once it gets going it's more reliable than anything. It's as if you have to let it roll downhill before starting the engine, as well. In other words, it may be a bit slow at first but be patient. The action is like a shy teenager at his first high school dance that has to warm up to everybody before finally loosening up. 48 frames per second is the same way as you eventually get used to it.

""An Unexpected Journey"" is so similar to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" though. Maybe that's one of the reasons it felt so rough to get through large chunks of it. The next two films will apparently venture in different directions from the original trilogy (this is coming from someone who hasn't read the books), so it seems like the best is yet to come. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is definitely worth going all out for. See it in 3D and see it in 48 frames per second if you can just for the experience. The special effects are unbelievable and there are some extraordinary chase and battle sequences buried deep within some thick doses of tediousness, but ""An Unexpected Journey"" has this veil of monotony draped over it that it's never really able to shake. It's gorgeous in theaters, but it makes you wonder how it's going to translate to DVD and Blu-ray and its slow pace makes you wonder if repeat viewings might become somewhat of a burden.",1355356800,2,6076,4.711194731890875
4639423,1,B0059XTU1S,"Peter Jackson and the rest of the film crew have horribly adapted The Hobbit into a film. A correct adaptation of The Hobbit would produce one film that is slightly over 3 hours, or produce two films where each part is 2 hours. There is no need for a trilogy where each film nears 2 and half hours. But the Jackson team decided to make a trilogy comprised of a story that is severely stretched far beyond what it should be.
 Positives about the film are: the visuals, the acting, and the score. Each screenshot looks amazing and is filled to its entirety. Actors assume the roles fairly well, and some create a character that seems to have walked straight off the book's page. The score is wonderful and sets tones perfectly; the soundtrack is actually worth the buy. But none of these positives make up for how long and how slow this first film is.
 Film makers did a horrible job at creating a film that edits out the slow parts of the book, and The Hobbit has plenty of parts where it needs to be edited in order to keep the story from slowing down. The second half of the book has tons of chapters and parts of chapters that have way too much dialogue, scenes of walking, and scenes of sleeping that are not important to the overall story. That second half of The Hobbit requires film makers to know what to cut out in order to create a film (or two films) where the viewers are on a non-stop thrill ride.
 A proper film adaptation would have an opening shot of Bilbo lighting his pipe as he sits outside. By the first half hour of the film, Bilbo should be at the trolls. Slightly over an hour, Bilbo should be in the cave with Gollum. An hour later, Bilbo and the dwarves should be plotting how to escape from the elves. Half an hour later, they should be preparing to fight Smaug. Twenty minutes later, the film should be over. This product of a Hobbit film can be produced when film makers cut out all the dialogue, walking, and sleeping that is not important to the overall story.
 Sadly, Jackson and his team do not produce such a product. They put in extra dialogue and extra scenes that are not in the book. This causes the film to be very slow and filled with tons of scenes where characters are not doing anything important to the overall story. But if Jackson and his team wanted to create three films to profit from, they had to severely stretch The Hobbit far beyond what it should be.
 The worst scene to be adapted from the book is when Bilbo and Gollum battle each other. The book depicts this scene as scary because Gollum is so slimy, crazy, and willing to eat anything. There is no humor in the dialogue and the scene is scary because readers do not know what Gollum is capable of nor do readers know what Gollum is willing to do so he can kill Bilbo. The Jackson team does not portray the scariness of this scene at all, and they add in humorous dialogue that under-minds the scariness of Gollum.
 The film also falls short with certain computer animation. The trolls, the wolves, and Gollum, do not look real because they either look to shiny, too dull, or they lack 3 dimensional aspects. These faults of the computer animation make it very easy to spot the animation, and that causes the film to lose its impact of lifelikeness. One can only imagine how poor Smaug the dragon will look in the next film.
 Due to such a poor film adaptation of The Hobbit, Hollywood definitely needs to consider remaking this film and it definitely needs to reconsider the validity Peter Jackson has as a director. But it is clear such considerations will not be performed because those considerations should have been made as soon as Return of the King was released. After that film, it was clear Jackson was poor at adapting Tolkien stories and it was clear that another film maker should have been assigned to film The Hobbit.
 A smart film maker would know how much editing The Hobbit needs in order to create a non-stop thrill ride. Such a film maker would realize you do not put in extra scenes and dialogue, you cut out irrelevant parts to create an action adventure film. And Jackson's film adaptation fails in this regard. Anyone who reads The Hobbit will realize how horrible this film is, especially since it only takes 3 and a half hours (perhaps 4) to read the book.",1355356800,42,4288,4.432741116751269
4639424,5,B0059XTU1S,"You won't be surprised to find out that things look much as they did in Lord of the Rings. You'll recognize the peaceful, scenic Shire and Bilbo's burrow. McKellen comes across as ageless in the role of Gandalf, looking for all the world as he did as Gandalf the Grey in Fellowship. As the movie progresses, the dramatic landscapes of New Zealand will also be familiar, as the adventurers travel far to reach the ancient Dwarven home, Eredor ... now known as the Lonely Mountain.

For any who don't know, the set up for ""The Hobbit"" is thus: Decades ago a dragon chased the dwarves out of their prosperous mountain home. With the dragon not having been seen in 60 years, a group of dwarves including the heir to their throne decide the time is right to check out the ancestral city. Gandalf decides they are correct to do so. He enlists Bilbo, a hobbit, to be their ""burglar"" for the expedition. His reasons for this unusual choice are explained as you watch the film.

I haven't read the book in a long time, and I don't want to provide spoilers, but if there were any details left out from the part of the story told in Unexpected Journey, I'd be surprised. We're going to have 8 to 9 hours devoted to the telling of ""The Hobbit"", which isn't nearly as expansive a tale as the Lord of the Rings books. The filmmakers allowed the story to take great patience with teaching us the history and introducing various characters.

The CGI is just as seamless as in the Lord of the Rings. Your suspension of disbelief whether a troll, orc, worg, or goblin is in your face will be complete. The action scenes are lavish, extended, and frenetic. In fact they were maybe a touch too frenetic, making for some very large differences between the very slow pacing of establishing scenes and the frantic action of the battles.

The movie goes to great lengths to try to satisfy everyone, from purist fans of the books to a general public who may know nothing about ""The Hobbit"" other than it is a ""prequel"" to Lord of the Rings. It may do a little TOO much to fill all plates. A dwarven song near the beginning of the movie was enough of a lullaby to have me nodding before it was done. LOL The riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum possibly was too generously paced. It is a bit like you are getting the ""extended version"" right from the start with this film.

There are some terrifying sequences here, and those scenes may not be suitable for young children. Orcs are just as unattractive in this film as in Lord of the Rings, and the close ups of goblins, especially the Goblin King, might be enough to make some just a bit queasy.

These are small quibbles. This is one impressive movie. It will grab your attention and keep it (unless the dwarves put you to sleep with their lullaby and no one pokes you to wake you back up!). The character building, with its relaxed pace, gives you a real sense of getting to know most of the dwarves, along with Galdalf and Bilbo. There is a very strong growth of character in this film for Bilbo, and in his relationship with his unexpected traveling companions.

You were going to go see this film anyway, but for the record ...

Highly recommended.",1355184000,,3178,4.457831325301205
