7907712,5,B00000FAJK,"This is the best jazz guitar instructional video I have ever studied and I have about 50 jazz guitar instructional videos!!!  It is not as intimidating as it first appears.  The booklet is well written and you just have to take it one step at a time.  Clint Strong's teaching approach in this video is to learn and play jazz ""lines"" rather than memorizing scales or modes.  He starts out with with examples of static dominant lines (V7 chord) and then progresses to static major 7 lines and then to static minor lines.  After that he teaches several II-V-I and then III-VI-II-V-I progressions.  Interspersed throughout the lessons, Clint plays several jazz standards with a bass, drums and piano.  The last part of the video includes an interview with Clint.  If you are not familiar with Clint's phenomenal jazz guitar playing, check out the CD's: (1) ""Marchel Ivery Meets Joey DeFrancesco"" by Marchel Ivery, and, (2) ""The Tone Generator"" by Eric Scortia.  Also, check out Clint's playing on ""My Favorite Things"" with Billy Sheehan on You Tube!  Clint plays live fairly regularly in clubs in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I know this VHS is difficult to obtain, but it is available.  Get It!",1450828800,4,1189,4.836633663366337
