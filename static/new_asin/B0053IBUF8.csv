8455270,5,B0053IBUF8,"The Man Who Could  Work Miracles is one of the few classics that is perfect.  Based on a short story by H. G. Wells, The Korda  Brothers talked Wells into writing the screenplay himself.  It is one of the most sensible, natural storytelling.  So much better than even Things to Come which feels very dated  What makes this perfect is that every idea is explored in turn and you see how he and everyone he talks to influences him until it all breaks loose in a magical ending.  Highly Recommended.",1379721600,,496,4.444444444444445

8455272,2,B0053IBUF8,"I've always loved H.G.Wells' short story ""The Man Who Could Work Miracles.""
It's a light, frothy tale of fate and irony, about a timid nobody
drinking at a pub one night, who suddenly acquires the power of a god.
(Naturally, being a man of amiably dim ability, he immediately misuses this power.)

In 1936 Alexander Korda produced and Lothar Mendes directed a slightly expanded
version of this story.  Roland Young is the simple commoner
who discovers he can send irritating bobbies literally to Hell (later San Francisco)
and ill-advisedly stop the Earth's rotation.  (Very bad idea!)

The film, a frothy fantasy of accents and impossibilities, has always
stuck in my memory.  Recently I ordered a copy through Amazon, from Hollywood's Attic.
No doubt public domain title, the vendor obviously took very little time or
care with the project.  Sound is weak, and the picture extremely ""soft"".
Black and white images are anemic.

I'm glad I took a chance, but this will remain one of my ""iffy"" acquisitions,
until a better vendor take a shot.  Only for Wells completists.",1346198400,2,1070,4.97191011235955
8455273,4,B0053IBUF8,"The story is by H.G. Wells, which is the main reason I bought the DVD. It's a very strange movie.

We open with three apparently Greek gods out in space, discussing the planet Earth. Two are contemptuous, but one (who seems to have made a pet of the planet, whether or not he created it) figures the planet and especially the human race has potential. ""Suppose I give them power, real power, let them work miracles."" The others urge caution, and suggest he give the ability to work miracles to just one man as an experiment, see what he does with it.

George Farthingay is the man chosen, apparently at random, by the hand of the aforementioned God. He's a draper's assistant in a department store in London. He discovers the power apparently by accident during a discussion on the subject of miracles in the local pub, which gives us the definition of a miracle: something contrary to the laws of nature which happens as a result of the will. As a sort of joke, George proposes that he will turn the lantern upside down without extinguishing it, breaking it or spilling the oil on the floor. As much to his surprise as anyone's, the lamp promptly turns upside down.

How he learns to use his power, and what he finds to be the limits of his power (he cannot change a person's mind, but he can move a policeman from London to San Francisco instantaneously), and the advice he gets on what to do with the power make up most of the movie. I won't spoil the ending, because it's way too cool to spoil.

This is a little gem of an old movie, and I am frankly charmed by the fact that it did not credit Christianity with the ability.",1337126400,,1628,4.380794701986755
