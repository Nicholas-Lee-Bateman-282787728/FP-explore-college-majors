7979207,2,B0000869UD,"This was very disappointing.  The video showed a lot of water, plants, mountains, but very little of Stavanger itself and the main points of interest in the city.  There was no voice over to explain what you were watching.  Basically, a very amateurish video...certainly not worth the $25.  I am going to Stavanger soon and didn't find this to be very valuable in understanding the city or it's points of interest.",1277164800,2,414,4.788732394366197
