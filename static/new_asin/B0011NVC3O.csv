8241962,4,B0011NVC3O,"An iconic documentary made in 1970 by the courageous Raymundo Gleyzer, dubbed Che Guevara with a camera by his admirers, who was murdered by the Argentinean dictatorship six years later.  It's a wonderful, committed  overview of Mexico's struggle for emancipation.  It features wonderful historic footage of two popular heroes, Pancho Villa and Emilino Zapata, and interviews with witnesses to some of the salient and defining moments in modern Mexican history. The quality of the digital transfer is poor, but it remains one of the most remarkable documentaries ever made.",1221868800,10,573,5.415730337078652
