8136899,1,B000H5V8GI,"what a ripoff of a legends name and likeness! all it is are a bunch of mexican "" lucha libra"" wrestling matches. thats it,no tribute to him or his family at all. zero!, just some mexicans ripping off eddie guerrero's good name for a buck!! disgusting,trashy people only do this!!not worth getting. get the official stuff at you know where..they have all his great matches and comedy.",1238976000,3,383,4.731343283582089
8136900,5,B000H5V8GI,"This video is great and is a honorable tribute to Eddie that's worth watching, especially when Hector, Mando, and Chavo wrestle, just like old times, and they're just as great now as they were back in the day, definately worth having if you're a true Guerrero fan...",1237593600,2,266,4.680851063829787
8136901,4,B000H5V8GI,"I wish they were just making another dvd with matches by the late great Eddie Guerrero. This dvd however looks like it will just  have tribute matches from fellow Mexican wrestlers. He deserves that but I also think they should release a WWE tribute dvd as well. With matches that weren't on his last dvd as well as matches from the Raw and Smackdown tribute shows. As well as goodbyes from Beniot, Rey, Dean Malenko, Chavo, J.B.L., HHH, HBK and Stephanie Macmahon.

  I'd like to see a dvd released with matches against Sean Waltman in WCW,his U.S. title win over DDP, his first match ever against Rey, more matches against Dean Malenko in ECW, WCW and WWE, matches against Beniot in WCW and WWE, matches against Jericho in WCW and the WWE, more matches against RVD, vs Edge, vs J.B.L, vs Chavo, vs Kurt Angle, vs The Big Show, vs Booker T. in the WCW and the WWE, vs Konnan ""i think they wrestled anyway"", vs Psychosis, vs Juvintud and in tag matches teaming with Chavo, vs Steve Austin on Raw.",1155254400,5,996,4.486187845303867
