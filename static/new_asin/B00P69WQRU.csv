6787674,5,B00P69WQRU,"I thought this movie was EXECELLENT. I am currently married to an incarcerated Man, who came home got overwhelmed with what life was giving him, got caught up and went back after being home for 5 years. I am SOOOO glad that there is a movie that showed about the effects of prison life from the woman's point of view. Everyone forgets that there are women who deal with with this. Some deal with it voluntarily and some involuntarily. I am also the mother of an incarcerated man.

There are so many layers to this type of relationship, I wish there were more movies made from this point of view. Everyday we are faced with the choice of staying and being supportive to them, or breaking away for our own sanity. My favorite scene was when she decided to walk away, no matter if you are in a relationship with a man on the outside or the inside, walking away is ALWAYS a hard thing to do, yet moreso when you are walking away from a man in prison.

It takes a strong woman to know that she has done all she can and at some point if he still doesn't want to get his act together, she has to walk away for HER!",1366156800,35,1107,4.168224299065421

6787691,3,B00P69WQRU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Beautifully photographed and wonderfully atmospheric, 'Middle of Nowhere' is former publicist turned writer/director Ava Duvernay's second feature film, which won the best directing award at Sundance. It's about Ruby, a young African-American woman, who gave up going to medical school to wait for her husband Derek, who's doing an eight year bid in the penitentiary after pleading guilty to gun charges.

When we first meet Ruby, she's visiting Derek at the inmate visiting center and appears smitten with him. Cut to four years later and she's still devoted as ever, taking the bus up to visit her bad boy love quite often. But the four years of incarceration have taken its toll on Derek and he hardly seems like the same person when he first went in. The warning signs are there, including a big scar across his neck, which Ruby conveniently ignores but is an obvious sign that he has not adjusted well with his fellow inmates.

When Derek comes up for his first parole hearing, Ruby is convinced that his best chance is to have legal representation when he goes before the Board. The same lawyer that they used originally for Derek's defense, is now available for the parole hearing but she's no longer willing to accept Ruby's payment of fees on installment. Ruby is forced to borrow an additional $750 from her mother, who is unhappy about her aloofness and lack of communication. Also in the mix is Ruby's sister, who doesn't care to involve their mother, in the parenting of her young son.

The plot thickens when Ruby meets a kindly bus driver, Brian. Most of their initial encounters are more tactile than verbal, and not so convincingly, it takes quite awhile before Ruby reveals information about her marriage and that she's separated from a man who is currently incarcerated. At this point, I'm thinking that Derek will be paroled, he'll come home and they'll be some kind of conflict between him and Brian. But Ms. DuVernay opts to go in another direction. At Derek's parole hearing, it's revealed that he's been recently disciplined for a violent confrontation with other inmates in prison and that he may be associated with various gang members. Worse for Ruby, is the revelation that a female correction officer was fired for having a sexual encounter with Derek. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Ruby's obsession with Derek gradually dissipates and she's drawn to Brian. And finally, after much soul searching, she decides to end her relationship with Derek, not before one last visit, when she expresses her affection for him, but makes it clear that he and she are no longer a couple (it becomes obvious that the 'bad boy', will not be leaving prison very soon at all!).

The 'Middle of Nowhere' features strong performances from its principals including the talented newcomer Emayatzy Corinealdi as Ruby. The film has tons of wonderful atmosphere and an inviting, folk rock score. Nonetheless, the plot is rather simple and is quite sluggish, focusing on Ruby's gradual moves toward self-actualization. Sacrificed are any real attempts to develop the characters, beyond the distillation of Ruby's crisis of conscience. Brian, in particular, alludes to some early problems with an ex-wife, but we find out hardly anything about him; he's more a plot device to ensure that Ruby doesn't end up stuck in the past, with a husband who's going nowhere.

'Middle of Nowhere' might have worked better if it was a little shorter in length. Despite the intensity of Ruby's relationship with the two men, I found myself growing rather tired of Ruby's self-destructive attraction to Derek. After awhile, it doesn't seem to matter why she's so attracted to him--I was just relieved at film's end, that she finally came to her senses, and gave him up. In this respect, 'Nowhere' is a cautionary tale for women who are attracted to 'bad boys'.

Some of the more interesting moments in ""Middle of Nowhere"" occur when we get a peak at how the criminal justice system works (the parole hearing is one such example). These moments add to the film's overall heady verisimilitude.

Overall, ""Middle of Nowhere' is worth a look. Don't expect any tremendous plot revelations and be prepared for scenes here and there, that drag. Nonetheless, the dialogue and intensity of the performances are a sight to be seen. Overall, the film will impress you, despite the limitations of a weak story line.",1446768000,4,4449,4.930574098798398

6787761,5,B00P69WQRU,"In this, her first feature, Ava Du Vernay crafts yet another excellent, quiet film (see also I WILL FOLLOW). As the title predicts, several characters find themselves in between with little clarity about the best path to pursue. Du Vernay's direction makes the lead's remove from reality evident via camera shots that hold her apart from what is obvious to those who care about her. The moral questions surrounding trust, companionship, family, and self unfurl without melodrama, leaving the viewer asking questions and considering her own point of view while never judging the compellingly wrought characters at the movie's heart. Roger Ebert endorsed and helped bring Du Vernay's very worthy artistic debut into the mainstream.

You don't have to be the wife of someone imprisoned to understand the drama and ups and downs that come with any long-term relationship. I'm not and don't know anyone who has ever been to jail but I still enjoyed the movie. The script nicely balanced the loyalty people have to their spouses with the loyalty they have to the rest of their family and, ultimately, to themselves.

The characters are very believable and the acting is first-rate. David Oyelowo (who is the lead role in Selma (2015)) is wonderful as is the female lead (Emayatzy Corinealdi), whom I'd never seen before.

6787781,4,B00P69WQRU,"4****, lethargic ending.  Last 20 minutes lost the connection to the movie.  Good quality up to then.  I know so little about this  but I do know a little bit about it.  I started an organization to write letters to prisoners to give them hope and found out that prison was it own type of university.  Lots of women's groups set up to write incarcerated people, men particularly, and end up realizing that their group was ill-equiped to make a difference for guy behind bards.  But I put together a plan, a day by day plan, for this one guy that was getting out of prison trying to show him that he has to have a schedule for everything hour he is out of prison in order to reset his life to a goal.  Sute, it didn't work out.  The guy gout out of jprison in Oct. and went back in March.  He blamed me, he said, because I was not there every step of the way.  I let him know that I was ""help"" not co-dependent.  I had sense enough to know not to be pulled into his quicksand while I tried to save him from it.  So.  Instead of him using that research and information I used it for my own life.  I found out that I needed ""saving"" myself.

I say from the start he was trying to rise to ""afford"" her and give her what he thought she deserved.  I say if he got out of prison he would repeat the behavior trying to give her an RN, a-could-be-doctor what he thought she deserved while she wanted a good, hardworking man to be in her life and comfortable to be there  because they loved each other.  So, did she marry beneath her?  Not at first, but he made it so.  He made it an issue.
After he got his final letter from her he likely stayed in prison or went right back when he got out and that is the same kind of emotion he had in the beginning that got him in prison.  And that makes him really sad.  And that makes the only thing really sad.  Some men go to prison and straighten up and fly right because they want to, because want it for themselves, because they went there once but do everything they need to do not to go back.  (And yes, the system ain't right.)  But billions of people live and do everything they can not to get caught up in the system. ---MO",1424649600,,2163,4.054373522458629

Ava DuVernay's excellent script comes alive and strikes a chord while still feeling quite real. Bradford Young's cinematography is stunning, as always. The cast is superb.

6787820,5,B00P69WQRU,"Middle of Nowhere is a beautiful examination of self-discovery, family relationships, an imbalanced prison system, and marital fidelity under unusual circumstances. Writer/Director Ava DuVernay (getting praise right now for the upcoming release 'Selma') rightfully received a number of accolades for her thought-provoking work and gorgeous direction of this important story. And the acting ensemble's performances are first-rate! The ending, as subtle as it was, left me in a hypnotic state.

Synopsis:
Ruby (Emayatzy Corinealdi) was happily married to wonderfully supportive husband Derek (Omari Hardwick) and was well on her way in medical school to becoming a doctor. However, their momentum to a dream life is disrupted when her husband is arrested and has to serve prison time. Back at home with her mother (the outstanding Lorraine Toussaint), Ruby finds herself spinning her wheels as she steadfastly fights to keep the light of the dream from being extinguished. That challenge is further complicated when her soul seems to connect with bus driver Brian (David Oyelowo) who enters the picture.

There apparently was some hoopla that delayed making the film available to the public. But whatever the case, I'm so glad it's finally here. I hope cinephiles discover this gem and make it the classic it deserves to be.",1417564800,23,1322,5.381642512077295
