8214716,4,B000UTMW4S,"The story line was created by Paul Henreid to be written by somebody else, and then he produced it and starred in it. It's lots of fun, once you get used to the idea that Paul Henreid, the suave intellectual and lover, can swashbuckle with the rest of them. The movie moves right along with swordplay, pistol duels, men thrown overboard, and general derring-do by all hands; costumes are elegant, humor is broad, ladies are spirited, and it certainly looks as if everybody enjoyed themselves. I would gladly give it a five except for the lack of opening credits and the as-is quality of the film. When somebody puts it out as it deserves, I'll up the ante.",1313452800,2,656,4.567796610169491
8214717,5,B000UTMW4S,"This is my favorite Pirate Film of all time.  Paul Henreid played my kind of hero.  Intelligent, Thoughtful and brave.  Binnie Barnes and Walter Slezak were great and Maureen O'Hara was as beautiful and feisty as she ever was.  Altogether the thinking man's Swashbuckler.",1282608000,,271,5.090909090909091
8214718,1,B000UTMW4S,"I cannot speak highly enough of Maureen O'Hara as an actor or about her beauty and she certainly takes every scene in this movie.  Walter Slazek is, as usual, a brilliant supporting actor and he plays the nasty piece of work to perfection, but I wish I could say the same for Paul Henreid.  Unfortunately, he is terribly miscast for the role and does not play very convincingly the part of the hero.  There is only one actor that plays this role of pirate captain to perfection so it's a pity that they didn't get Errol Flynn.

The quality of this film is also very poor and certainly not worth the money that is being asked for by the retailer.  Viewing the movie is like looking through a smoke haze because no effort was made to clean it up.  I'd stay away from buying movie until a studio does a proper job it.",1228608000,4,814,4.287581699346405
8214719,5,B000UTMW4S,"I love this movie.  I totally disagree with the reviewer who felt the roles were miscast.  Paul Henreid is perfect as the Barracuda, a pirate with plenty of courage and a sense of principle.  Maureen O'Hara is breathtakingly beautiful as well as spirited.  Walter Slezak is hilarious in the role of the fat and pompous bridegroom-to-be; watching him, I was reminded of the buffoonery in Moliere's plays.  The plot is charming.  O'Hara has been promised in marriage to Slezak sight unseen, but the ship carrying her to him is first intercepted by Henreid and his band of pirates, allowing Henreid and O'Hara to meet.  The unscrupulous Slezak, whom O'Hara does finally meet, overrides her evident disgust of him by informing her that she is marrying him regardless of her inclination to go home to her father.  The rest is a dashing adventure offering various tight spots for the characters to deal with.

The host on Turner Classic Movies, which recently aired the movie on TV, pointed out that Maureen O'Hara's fiery hair and green eyes were so lovely that when she was cast, the producers felt they had no choice but to make the movie in Technicolor, a significant decision at a time when virtually no movies had yet been made in color.  The decision was aptly made, as O'Hara's coloring, and actually the entire movie, has a lush look as a result.

Henreid is an excellent leading man--handsome, brave, and given to teasing O'Hara just enough to be endearing.  O'Hara surprises by evolving as a character in the movie and is a much more sympathetic character at the end than in the beginning.

I enjoy this movie and recommend it.",1198972800,12,1632,4.765124555160142
