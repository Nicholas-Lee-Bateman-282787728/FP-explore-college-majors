1882586,5,B00009AV94,"A Great ppv
Los Gurrerros vs. Team Angle - A good open.  Got kinda boring in the middle but it had it's moments. 3/5
Rikishi vs. Sean O'haire - What kind of match is this.  Not a ppv match. 2/5
RVD and Kane vs. The Dudley's - Great match everything went well RVD with some wicked moves. 5/5
Trish Stratus vs. Jazz - Not a very good match. way to short and no womens match will ever top the one at WrestleMania XIX. 2/5
Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio - Okay match. Mostly Big Show tossing Rey Mysterio around like a rag dog. 3/5
Brock Lesnar vs. Jon Cena - Great match. fast paced.  Cena showed that he can be a main event playa.  5/5
Booker T, HBK, Kevin Nash vs. HHH, Ric Flair and Chris Jericho - Great match again except for the ending.  If Booker T or Shawn Michaels are in a match you can count on it being a good one. 5/5
Goldberg vs. The Rock - Greatest match ever.  Goldberg proved he can do the Rock Bottom better than the Rock.  Goldberg didn't stay down he kept on fightin back and proved who the better man was. 5/5
Total: 30/40
The score seems low but buy it for Rock vs. Goldberg, 6 Man tag, Brock vs. Cena, and World Tag team titles.",1052697600,,1143,4.030973451327434
1882587,2,B00009AV94,"Saw this ppv and let me just say, Vinnie Mac needs some help...BADLY.  This cannot be what he needs to help WWE get back on its feet.  Here's the card to prove that:
WWE Tag Team Championship
Los Guerreros vs. Team Angle(c)
***1/2-This actually was my favorite match on the card.  Not saying much as you'll see later, but it at least started off good.  Great chemistry and many false finishes as should be expected when you wrestle Eddie and Chavo.  Team Angle looks like they're gonna be great for a while if they keep this up.  Can't wait for the ladder match at Judgement Day!
Rikishi vs. Sean O'Haire(w/Roddy Piper)
**-They tried, but nobody cared at all for this.  How can you when they're fighting over coconout bashing?  Too slow for my taste.
WWE World Tag Team Championship
Kane/RVD vs. Dudleys
***-Nice chemistry mixing all their trademark moves together, but I'm just not into Kane/RVD being paired up.  So much talent between them and WWE still doesn't know what to do with them.  Adding Morley as ref was a nice touch though, providing the distractions for champs and ticking off the crowd.
Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio
*1/2-Please erase this from the DVD.  Waste of time and just further proves how Big Slow can't move or breathe if matches go past 5 minutes.  Show wins with chokeslam, comes back to take Rey, while he is on stretcher, and whack him on ringpost and dropping him on his head.  Nice job protecting your opponent there, Big Slow.
WWE Women's Title
Jazz vs. Trish Stratus(c)
**-I enjoy them as wrestlers and the match was OK, but this feud's been done to death.  Not really their faults, but that will change when Lita comes back.
WWE World Championship
Brock Lesnar(c) vs. John Cena
***-The third and final favorite of mine of the night.  A little slow pacing, but it was good storytelling.  I actually thought Cena would win, but obviously they need it on Brock what with Angle and Edge out for a bit.  Wins it with F-5, hope they do a rematch soon.
HHH/Flair/Jericho vs. Booker T/HBK/Nash
*- The previous match was my final favorite and I say that because the quality dropped immensely from here.  What are they thinking doing feuds with the Kliq again?  HHH has slowed down considerably in this ""post-quad"" era, as I like to call it, not to mention he rambles too much now.  Nash is old and waiting for another leg injury and people just can't get into him anymore.  I like HBK but he's not main event caliber anymore, have him build people up like he did Jericho at WMXIX.  This match was a waste of time and talent for the likes of Booker T and Jericho.  Booker T should be champ and feuding with Y2J, how's that sound?  Anyway, ended with HHH using sledgehammer on Nash to win.  Gee, I've never seen that happened before.
Rock vs. Goldberg

**-If this was Vince's money match, then the people who put money on this ppv just to see this are gonna regret giving that money away.  Too many things wrong.  They changed Goldberg's music.  Rock was more the face here than Goldberg.  Goldberg was working too slow for me and seemed to want to just get the majority of the script done so he can spear and jackhammer Rock, which is basically all he can do.  He did do that and won and the fans booed him for it.  Yikes, not looking good.
OVERALL:As I said, not looking good for 2003.  I'll give them credit, they were trying new things.  Cena looked good in his first title match.  O'Haire looks promising, just not feuding with Rikishi.  And the tag title matches were great.  But I just didn't feel it here like I did the first three ppvs for this year.  Hope Judgement Day can be better.",1052697600,,3614,4.494623655913978
1882588,4,B00009AV94,"After an excellent wrestlemania 19 ,all the superstars are back in this good ppv with a lot of middle card wrestlers and 2 main events with the goldberg and rock match ,and the tag confrontation between hhh,y2j,flair and hbk,diesel,booker T.
It was an honorable show with some superstars missing (edge,angle,austin...)'cause injuries;but the show was intense with team angle,the title shot with cena and the kane/RVD spectacular alliance. What else? An entertaining backstage show with torrie,stacy and sable. I watched the ppv live and it was ,i tell you, better than the royal rumble and no way out;so the second best ppv of the year according to me.",1051833600,,652,5.102803738317757
1882613,3,B00009AV94,"I think Backlash was the first dud as far as 2003 WWE Pay-Per-Views go.  The Royal Rumble was great, with a great rumble match and a classic title match between Angle and Benoit, No Way Out had some awesome matches and huge main events with Austin's return and Hogan vs. Rock 2 and Wrestlemania 19 was just great through and through.

But Backlash had a few too many mediocre matches with all of the major stars and big names thrown at the end of the show with The Rock and Goldberg main event, and Raw's six biggest wrestlers all in one forgettable tag team match. But nevertheless I'll go through a quick match-by-match.

{WWE Tag Team Championship}
The World's Greatest Tag Team (c) vs. Los Guerreros

This was one of the better matches and probably the best match to open with. The fans were behind Eddie and Chavo all the way, but it did have a number of slow spots that pulled a ""boring!"" chant from the crowd. But that doesn't make this match any worse. The only thing I'd change is I'd probably make it a couple of minutes shorter since it was already 15 minutes long, which was actually longer than the main event.
7.5/10

Sean O'Haire w/ Roddy Piper vs. Rikishi

Eh. Press the skip button. The only things to be seen here are some generic wrestling, Piper getting hit with a coconut and Sean O'Haire's somewhat impressive finishing move. This match seemed to go nowhere really. It was to put over Sean O'Haire, which seemed pontless since his push seemed to end very quickly.
3.5/10

{World Tag Team Championship}
Rob Van Dam & Kane (c) vs. The Dudley Boyz
Special Guest Referee: Chief Morley

Surprisingly, this was the most entertaining match in my eyes. As much as I hate when two should-be main event wrestlers like RVD and Kane get thrown together into a tag team, I have to admit, that Rob Van Dam and Kane were a good team and fun to watch. And of course, The Dudleyz are one of the best, if not, THE best, tag team still around in wrestling.
The build up to the match was good with The Dudleys being forced into the match reluctantly and Chief Morley being against RVD and Kane all the way. It was a fun match, and, as much as it pains to me to say, this match was probably match of the night (yes, better than Rock and Goldberg, and better than Cena and Lesnar.)
8/10

{WWE Women's Championship}
Trish Stratus (c) vs. Jazz w/ Theodore Long

Diva matches are usually hit or miss as far as I'm concerned, but Jazz and Trish are two really good women's wrestlers. But this match was a bit more of a miss. The ending was just, I don't know, odd. Theodore Long threw his shoe at Trish to distract her during a pin. I don't know. Hit the skip button.
3/10

Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio

When I saw this match on the card, I was so sure this match would be horrible. While it is interesting to see the smallest guy in WWE face the biggest guy, I figured the interest factor would wear off and make the match highly predictable.
I was, however, surprised as I did stay interested throughout the entirety of the match. Granted the match wasn't even 4 minutes long. Rey used some mind games and his speed to try and outwit the Big Show. And for a second, I even believed that Rey could win, but then of course, the inevitable massive chokeslam happened. Big Show was then made out to be a monster and destroyed Rey after the match, readying him for another push to the WWE title.
Show is actually a bit of an underrated wrestler in my view, a lot of people think he's overrated and just used for his size, but I've seen some great matches with him in it, and he's good at adapting to different situations and styles.
6/10

{WWE Championship}
Brock Lesnar (c) vs. John Cena

Meh. This was Cena's first big title push. He actually makes a good heel, but I never bought into Lesnar as a face. But then again I wasn't the biggest Lesnar fan.
The match was pretty slow and these two do have the potential to put on a better match, maybe they were just having an off night, but a Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena could be good if it had been booked a little later in Cena's career.
5/10

{Six-Man Tag Match}
Triple H, Ric Flair and Chris Jericho vs. Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels and Booker T

This match just seemed cluttered to me. You've got six huge names, but it seemed to be built entirely around the Triple H/ Kevin Nash feud. It's like they forgot about the massive Shawn Michaels/ Triple H feud and Booker T's main event at 'Mania, even the HBK and Y2J feud. The ending was a bit of a predictable diappointment with Triple H coming in with the trusty sledgehammer and walking away looking like the bigger man, already getting a win over Kevin Nash right at the start of their feud. It really made Nash look weak. I think if they wanted the feud to work, they should really have had HBK and Booker T get the pinfall, or even end it with a DQ finish.

6/10

The Rock vs. Goldberg

This was really the only major match that they hyped for the event, and I'm assuming the only match anyone bought the PPV for, I know it was for me. I mean you have WWE's biggest guy versus the biggest guy from WCW. The only match that should've filled more seats could possibly have been Goldberg vs. Austin, which'll never happen.
It's a nice novelty to see Rock and Goldberg in the same ring as one another. But the match isn't that amazing. It's still decent though and entertaining, if only for The Rock's efforts. The crowd seemed very Pro-Rock.
The ending was predictable, there was no way Goldberg would lose his first match in the WWE.
It was entertaining, but it didn't save Backlash.
7.5/10

Overall, Backlash is an average pay-per-view, you'll find yourself wanting to fast forward through some matches (like Rikishi and O'Haire and the Women's title match) and you'll find yourself rolling your eyes at the predictability of other matches.

Highlights:
*World Tag Title Match
*Goldberg and The Rock

Downfalls:
*Every other match

The opening tag match should have been a few minutes shorter, and maybe with a bit of a better ending.
Sean O'Haire and Rikishi should have been replaced with a good match. I'd like to know why the Undertaker and Chris Benoit weren't booked on this card. Maybe they had legitimate reasons but if not, then it's just stupid to have so much time filled up with some of the rubbish they filled this pay-per-view with. And throughout the entirety of the pay-per-view there were short segments involving an altercation between Torrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler, ultimately to set up the Test and Scott Steiner feud which was a blatant waste of time before the storyline even came to fruition.
On top of this, was the six-man tag necessary? I would've maybe made it into a normal tag match with Flair & Triple H against Nash and Shawn Michaels and then have Booker and Jericho in a one on one match.

I'd avoid this DVD unless you're trying to collect all of the 2003 DVDs, or you're just interested in the Rock/Goldberg main event.",1273795200,,6947,4.443396226415095
1882614,3,B00009AV94,"Team Angle VS Los Guerreros: What a way to kick off a PPV with this fast paced, back and fourth encounter. Alot of lying, cheating, and stealing in this match makes it very entertaining but Team Angle retains in the end. The one problem I had with this match is I never noticed how when the ref's back is turned, if he heard hands slap it's an automatic tag. It happened alot in this match and was just plain stupid but didn't really take away from the action.

Rikishi VS Sean O'Haire: Roddy Piper is currently managing O'Haire, a typical WWE big man that was brought in and quickly forgotten about. They use the story of how Kishi is looking revenge for his uncle, Jimmy Snuka, about when Piper smashed a coconut on Snuka's skull more then twenty years ago. Of course, Kishi smashes a coconut on Pipers skull but it costs him the match. A decent big man brawl match but O'Haire did look impressive for his short WWE run.

Dudley Boyz VS Kane and RVD: I remember this feud well, as Cheif Morley tried at all lengths to strip Kane and RVD of the tag titles. Surprisingly, Morley calls it down the middle for most of the match but of course it heads south towards the end. Dudley's hit Morley with a 3-D so they are down a ref. Kane hits a choke slam, RVD hits his 5-star frog splash, and out runs a ref to count the three. A pretty entertainig match overall.

The continuing of Stacey and Torrie ends in a brawl. Earlier in the PPV Test kisses Torrie Wilson and Sable sees it and tells Stacey. Why the hell i'm I writing this? It's pointless and stupid.

Jazz VS Trish: Skip. Wow, Teddy Long has come a long way in WWE. From ref to manager to the general manager of Smackdown.

Booker T is talking to Shawn Michaels in the locker room. The only reason why I pointed this out is because recently T stated he wanted his last match to be against HBK.

Big Show VS Rey Mysterio: This match has been seen so many times before with Mysterio. He faces a big man and tries his best to hang on and sometimes he scores a win. Awesome, short match as Mysterio almost scores a win but Show choke slams Mysterio and wins it. Mysterio used a chair after Show pushed the ref out of the way to start the offense, but isn't Show pushing the ref a automatic DQ? Well, thats WWE for you! Mysterio sells the chokeslam as big move and gets put on a stretcher and Show takes him and whips him against the ringpost. Sick but it was awesome!

John Cena VS Brock Lesnar for the WWE championship: Cena wins a tournament the gain the shot and beat some pretty big names to get here. I miss Cena doing these raps and it's the only time I really enjoyed watching Cena. Overall, it was a pretty good match-up and Cena looked good in defeat.

Triple H, Ric Flair, and Chris Jericho VS Booker T, Shawn Michaels, and Kevin Nash: A pretty good match with Triple H winning after hitting Nash with the sledgehammer. Maybe he thought if Nash won the world title, he'd ruin the WWE. This was just a match to put feuds in one match, mostly done on Raw.

The Rock VS Goldberg: Never cared for Goldberg until he came to WWE, probably because he beat Triple H for the world title. This would be Rock's final WWE match as he moved onto Hollywood, you can watch it as a bonus feature on the dvd. Rock cuts a interview before the match that was funny but seemed rushed. The match takes a few minutes to start and when it does, it pauses for a few more seconds. Then we finally get some action for a brief few minutes. Rock tries his best, Goldberg is slow paced and boring to watch. An overall disappointment and will go down as one of the worst executed dream matches in wrestling.

Overall, a good PPV expect for the main event. Goldberg VS Rock was a failure and brought down what was a good PPV.",1252713600,,3754,4.259831460674158

I liked it and that was smooth Matches but some matches were waste subtrances Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Chris Beniot, World Title Match, and better main event than The Rock vs. Goldberg. Also, have 3 out of 8 matches is Tag Team Match! 3 is much if better 1 tag team match. Also, there have no triple threat match or etc. than single match.

1) WWE Tag Team Champion Team Angle vs. Los Guerreros: That good and lot of wrestle techology too. Bad end but fun at after match. While Charile Haas pinned Chavo, Shelton Benjamin hold Chavo's both of legs to away from rope then 1,2,&3 and Team Angle win by cheat. Los Guerreros were stolen the title then leave the arena with lowride car. That's good match.

Rating: 8/10

Winner: Team Angle

2) Rikini vs. Sean O'hairo: blah... blah.... That's ruin Backlash's rating so I guess that was shrot and not good match but I give 6 rating to Sean's action finisher move on Rikini.

Team Angle v. Team Guerrero's WWE Tag Titles- This match started off with some good solid wrestling. Both the Guerrero's and Team Angle had good solid chemistry in this one. Towards the end things were getting hot and the crowd was really into it.. I loved seeing Eddies' ""3 amigos"" (one of my favorite moves). The end came when Chavo was trying to suplex Haas but Shelton held his feet down for the surprise win. Very good opener for this ppv. Only complaint was it could have went at least 2 minutes longer.. Still it was 15 minutes of action.. But that does not subtract from this match as it did what it needed for the time and definately is worth the watch. Especially towards the end!

Rating- 3.

Rikishi v. Sean O' Haire w/ Piper-

OOC- Their is this annoying fan who keeps doing some odd noise

O.K. During the first portion of this match saw Piper interfering and being a distraction. O' Haire dominates w/ power moves and does a resthold which the crowd is dead right now. The crowd ought of a sudden is looking somewhere else it seems like and is booing, at what, I have no idea... This crowd seems really distracted.. Half paying attention.. Half not.. Weird.. Rikishi avalanches O' Haire in the corner and O' Haire drops.. Crowd erupts.. We know what is next.. Stinkface....NO!. O Haire does a hilarious boot to Rikishi's ass to send him crashing down on his... well.. ass.. Soon after a bit of offense Piper gets in w/ a coconut but ends up getting smashed in the head and Rikishi salutes Snuka.. Turn around.. BOOOOM!! What a move that was!!.. 1..2..3. This match had little that would amaze you.. It goes at a decent pace.. It doesn't get to the point where you can not watch.. It just doesn't offer something that gets you standing on your feet until the last moments with Piper. Still this was an O.K. match.

Rating- 2.

Kane & R.V.D. vs. Dudleys Special Ref- Chief Morley

This match started off with some solid paced quick tagging from Kane and RVD. RVD was at his best in this match. Solid chemistry from Bubba and R.V.D. as well as D-Von and Kane. Towards the end of this match is simply breath taking and it was on spot. After interference by Storm and Morley. RVD hits the frog splash after a Kane chokeslam on Bubba. Excellent match that had a great ending which brought my grade up. As far as the match, it was up there with the opening tag match but the ending brought this from good to great. Some critics hated the interference but it set up the well executed ending and left me breathless.

Rating- 4

Trish v. Jazz Womens title-

This match starts off with the noticeable Womens offense......................... Towards the end Teddy throws a shoe and hits trish.. Teddy blames a fan.. lol. Trish hits Teddy with it.. Jazz eventually rolls Trish for the 3. This actually was a good paced match but lacked variations of wrestling. It wasn't what you called a ""womens classic"".. But I don't think it was completely terrible. A decent match.. Just not ""good"".. Mediocre is the better word for this..

Rating- 1

Rey vs. Big Show-

A perfect way to sum this up is David vs. Goliath. Big Show for the most part was throwing Rey around like a plum. Rey came in with some good offense with a 619 to the stomach,leg and head. Eventually he goes for a west coast pop and is countered into a monstrous Chokeslam. You have to see this match.. It was a good David vs. Goliath match. People say its wasting time blah blah.. But I certainly loved this match because it added something besides your basic singles match.. Great ""filler"", if you want to call it that.. It kept the crowd and me going.. Also, watch after the match when Big show throws the stretcher into the ringpost. Rey hits his head and damn near has a concussion. That got Big show some heat with vince. Good David v. Goliath match

Rating- 3

Brock vs. Cena WWE Title

This match had its up and downs.. There were 3 or 4 botched and messed up spots that were slightly noticeable if you pay attention. John Cena applies a very boring resthold for what seems like 3 minutes in my eyes that brings the grading down a good bit plus the crowd was that much into it except a few ""Cena!"" chants. It seemed sorta long. Brock gets busted open on his exposed wound Cena busted open on a SD. Cena gets chain taken away by ref and F-5 and its over. I give this o.k. because of a few boring moments and missed spots.. Plus I think it could have been much better.

Rating- 2

HHH, Flair, Jericho vs. Booker T., Nash, Michaels Six man tag

This match was an o.k. match. The crowd sort of hurt this match because they were watching and did not seem too much in crowd response which hurt this match. It wasn't a bad match at all but it could have been better. It seemed a little slow at times but picked up and made up for it. I  HATED the end because Nash and Flair nearly botched the finish  when Nash through Flair into the red. They seriously messed that up and if you watch it you can tell how corny they did that. HHH nails Nash with sledgy.. I really thought this match could have been better. It rates as o.k.

Rating- 2

Goldbeg v. Rock

This was a split crowd for this match. Half rock, half Goldberg. Rock basically carried this whole match and made Goldberg look really good. I tip my hat to Rock because Goldberg has such a basic offense.. Goldberg served his purpose but I credit Rock for making this match decent. Rock showed off his good acting skills in this match and really got the crowd going and entertained.. I believe that if Rock was not in this match and Goldberg was paired with anyone else... This match would have been a disaster. My complaint is Goldberg favored his injured shoulder too much and seemed a bit slow. He revved it up towards the end and ended this match before it could lose any credibility.. I give this match an o.k. rating.. Because of it being a spot to spot match... Goldberg's lack of creative moves.. It boosts with Rock's entertainment and selling and making Goldberg look good. So it is a main event just because of The Rock.. But I think maybe a better six man tag could have helped out for the two main events.

Rating- 3 (Rock's performance, selling...)

In conclusion- This wasn't like the greatest ppv ever by any means but it was definitely watchable. The only thing I really didn't like was the six man but it picked its pace up. At one time I was going to give it a bad rating especially that finish that I still don't like but it had a bit in the beginning and middle to say it was o.k. Overall, if you're interested in this event I say it is pretty much worth it. I got it and I don't hate that I got it.. So that's definitely a good thing.. For historical purposes it's the first and only time Rock and Goldberg wrestled.. Six man could have been better.. And this ppv offers a way underrated undercard. So I give this ppv an 80 rating meaning it was a good event and worth a buy. It just gets there because of the six man mess. Still, however, I will recommend this and the extras is pretty good.",1133913600,,7541,4.336415362731152

Backlash 2003

A good event but the two main events could have been a lot better

WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS MATCH

Team angle vs. Los gurreros

A high flying match im glad that team angle got the victory because I hate Eddie gurrerro I don't care if he is now dead I hate him and im so glad I won't have to watch another match with him in

Rickishi vs. Sean o' haire with rowdy roddy piper

An average match for a raw card

Women's championship match

Jazz vs. Trish stratus

Boring to say the least and I hate teddy long

A funny match if your me and hate rey mysterio  you will love what big show does to rey mysterio absolutely hilarious

Six man tag match

Kevin nash,shawn michales,booker t vs. triple h,ric flair,chris jericho

A good match but weak in places very sloppy ending that sets the tone for judgement day and bad blood in witch triple h and Kevin nash go at it and all so for shawn michales and ric flair who face each other at bad blood take away jericho for this mtach and add batista and take away booker t for this match and add undertaker

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH

Brook lesnar vs. john cena

I didn't care who won this match as I hate both wrestlers john cena  can't rap very annoying match were you knew lesnar wasn't goin to lose to cena 4 weeks after wrestle mania we don't need wannabees like john cena is the mix of smack down or raw he is nobody talking about he grew up on the streets so what who cares and all this thuga nomics rubbish use  proper words were you don't have to use spell check let cena have his 5 mins of glory then let him be the first match on Sunday night heat

THE MAIN EVENT

THE ROCK VS GOLDBERG

The rock should have won this match the only reason there is Goldberg is because eric bishoff wanted a stone cold look a like for wcw wcw is a complete shambles the rock should have won this match the rock has beaten Hogan,triple h,undertaker,stone cold,mankind,kurt angle,the big show,booker t the best there is

And who has Goldberg beaten sting and jeff jaret lol please wwe don't let Goldberg back there are farbetter wrestlers in the wwe for example Shelton Benjamin  watching wwe  in 2003 was like I was watching wcw nitro I don't wana see the likes of booker t or Goldberg or Kevin nash or hulk Hogan or scot steiner or rey mysterio or eddie gurero his dead lol good the rock is far greater than any wcw wrestler the rock is simply the best there is in the bussiness

Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-WWE Tag Team Championship-Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas(C)Vs Eddie & Chavo Guerrero-This match was a very good way to start this PPV. It had some good action with a nice ending which finished this match and the way it was set properly. Great moment after the match involving the teams. My rating 7.42/10.

Match Two-Sean O'Haire Vs Rikishi-This was a short match with some good solid ring work between these two men. Roddy Piper got a coconut smashed across his head very funny it was. Good strength shown by O'Haire. Match was too short though. My rating 5.81/10.

Match Three-World Tag Team Championship-Kane & RVD(C)Vs The Dudleys-Val Venis or Chief Morley as he was known here was the special referee making it a challenge for RVD & Kane. The match was nothing spectacular but it was still good to keep this show rolling. My rating 6.19/10.

Match Four-Womens Title-Trish Stratus(C)Vs Jazz-This was a nice short match with some good action between two of the best women wrestlers in the division today. The feud between these two has been quite good producing in some good matches. My rating 6.01/10.

Match Five-Big Show Vs Rey Mysterio-This was a short basic squash match but it was still kind of interesting watching the big man vs small man type of match. Hopefully Rey and Show get pushed for the big titles during the year. My rating 6.41/10.

Match Six-WWE Championship-Brock Lesnar(C)Vs John Cena-This was the match of the night, had lots of action, some blood and it told a story. This definetly should have been the main event for the night. Hopefully these two feud again one day. John Cena used to be so awesome as a heel. My rating 8.30/10.

Match Seven-Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels & Booker T Vs Chris Jericho, HHH & Ric Flair-This was a good match with two feuds booked into one making it good, but the ringwork was rather sloppy. Hopefully over the next few months they put Y2J Vs HBK again and HHH Vs Nash as well. This was definetly a good match though. My rating 8.15/10.

Match Eight-Main Event-Rock Vs Goldberg-This was a fairly sloppy match, Rock playing the heel got more cheers then Goldberg and there was too many finishers and Goldberg was not good in the ring at all. This was a very bad match for a main event let alone a main event on PPV. My rating 6.82/10.

This was a fairly ordinary PPV but it still had a couple of good matches. The score was 55.11/80 which equals 68.88%. In a grade it is a B- which means it was a Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.",1129334400,,3943,4.474647887323943

SHELTON BENJAMIN & CHARLIE HAAS defeated EDDIE & CHAVO GUERRERO to Retain the WWE Tag-Team Championship Well, I got my wish of this match being given enough time to successfully play out, so I cannot complain about that. Good tag-team psychology out there in the ring during this bout. Did you notice the way Eddie basically ran the whole match to a certain extent? He was even calling the timing of a few of the spots for Team Angle. Honestly, I was a little disappointed overall. Nothing really jumped out of the screen & grabbed me during the match. It was good, just nothing special unfortunately. Match Rating...7

SEAN O'HAIRE defeated RIKISHI: Nothing great here. In fact, I can see why a lot of people would have hated this match. I didn't think it was too offensive though, because it was short enough & fairly well choreographed. The one thing I am very unsure about is the direction that the WWE are going with on Sean O'Haire. He is not a Brock Lesnar or a Batista type, so please let him be his own man in the ring. Giving him only power moves to do is only going to make him look weak as he progresses. Match Rating...5

ROB VAN DAM & KANE defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles You know it makes me laugh that some people cannot get pre-conceived ideas out of their heads!!! 'Lame-duck champions', ""the 2 teams have fought each other before"", 'predictability', etc, etc, etc... blah, blah, blah... crap, crap, crap. Judged independently, this was by far the match of the night. Treat it as such!!! Simply put; This was a well put together, well performed, perfectly timed, exciting match. I must say that RVD does look better when he has ex-ECW guys as opponents selling for him, but that plus the Morley & Storm shenanigans only added to the excitement of the match in my opinion. Match Rating...8

JAZZ defeated TRISH STRATUS to Win the Womens Title: Perfectly acceptable women's match. I liked some of the move sequences & there was no botched moves to speak of. Unfortunately, the division needs more than 'perfectly acceptable' & this bout didn't present anything more. We need Lita back in the ring quickly. Jazz wins & that's fine by me for the time being. Match Rating...5

THE BIG SHOW defeated REY MYSTERIO: I'm past the barracking stage of my life when it comes to wrestling, but I was genuinely barracking for Rey during this match. Very entertaining overall with Rey getting in enough offense to make it worthwhile. The Big Show falling down just reminds me how funny he can be, but after what happened following the match, something tells me that comedy won't be in his near future. Wicked shot to the ringpost with Rey tied to that board stretcher. Simply wicked!!! Match Rating...6

BROCK LESNAR defeated JOHN CENA to Retain the WWE Championship: Don't know what to make of this one. They were obviously trying to have an intense psychological match. While they didn't completely fail, these guys aren't Angle & Benoit just yet. The match also lasted a few minutes too long in my opinion. We will all probably look back & say that this will be a successful start to Cena's push. But taken individually, I didn't really get involved. Match Rating...6

TRIPLE H, RIC FLAIR & CHRIS JERICHO defeated KEVIN NASH, SHAWN MICHAELS & BOOKER T: Yet another match on the card that I didn't mind, but where something extremely important was missing. In this case, it was the unbelievably anti-climactic finish. And I'm not just saying that because Triple H got the pin. The match was progressing fairly well with a good variety of combinations in the ring throughout. Then the ref got bumped, the sledgehammer came out & it was all over. I don't know if it was too quick, or whether the sledgehammer has had it's day, but I was just left very unimpressed by the ending of the bout. Match Rating...7

Before I get into the main event, I have to state that I will usually include a segment in the overall 'PPV Rating' if I believe it lasted long enough. I cannot include The Rock's interview before the match because the time taken wasn't significant. But I found it so entertaining & laughed so hard that I have decided to add a point to the match rating of the main event.

BILL GOLDBERG defeated THE ROCK Strange main event match to say the least. I think it lasted about 13 minutes, yet it had so few wrestling sequences. In between Goldberg's over-selling of a shoulder injury & The Rock entertaining us, there was hardly any time for wrestling. A hard one to rate because it appealed to me for it's entertainment value, but didn't from a wrestling perspective. I suppose that's to be expected with Goldberg getting back into the ring, and The Rock just about to leave. Match Rating...5 + 1 = 6

PPV RATING (50/80) = 62.5

Looking at the key, I have given Backlash a 'C+' grade & have said that it was 'Worth A Watch'. I'm pretty much happy with that. It's one of those events that are fine to watch, but I wouldn't go out of my way for. No standout match was levelled off by the fact that there wasn't a terrible (failing) match on the card. A lot of the bouts had elements I really liked, but because of a lack of something else throughout the match, just didn't work as a whole.",1114732800,,5792,4.552884615384615

Rikishi vs. Sean O'Haire w/ Rowdy Roddy Piper

Ok match.  Piper and Rikishi settle an old score.  They tried to push O'Haire but his charisma was seriously lacking.

World Tag Team Championship

Rob Van Dam & Kane vs. Dudley Boyz w/Chief Morley as special ref

Maybe match of the night.  Unpredictable action and people turning on people at the drop of a hat.  Good action.

Rey Mysterio vs. Big Show

There was only so much that they could do.  They almost pull off a pretty good match.  It's after the match that has to be seen to be believed.

Trish Stratus vs. Jazz

WWE Championship

Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena

Imagine if this match happened now!  It's nice that the wwe gave Cena a chance early.  The match is pretty decent and Cena holds his own but the outcome was very predictable.  Start of a good year for Cena.

Six Man Tag Team Match

Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels, & Booker T vs. Triple H, Chris Jericho, & Ric Flair

Bizarre choice for a ppv match.  They could've made a regular tag match and one singles match.  It's good but a little underwhelming.

The Rock vs. Goldberg

There are several dumb segments which lead to other low points in the night where Test flirts with Torrie, Sable rats Torrie out to Stacy, Stacy beats Torrie down!, Torrie gets some offense in and a box falls on Stacy's head, Steiner to the rescue, Test gets pissed!, start of a horrible fued!!! All the lowest points of the evening!!! Thanks Torrie for being on Smackdown, yet managing to start one of RAW's worst feuds ever!

Match #3 RVD & Kane (c) vs. The Dudleys w/ Chief Moreley as SGR for the World Tag Team Championships: Great match, except for Moreley. Dudleys realize this sucks and destroy Moreley and Lance Storm. After a chokeslam and frogsplash, Kane and RVD retain! 9/10

Match #4 Jazz vs. Trish Stratus (c) for the Women's Championship: Yet another bad match with Jazz ending it quickly. Jazz sucks so so bad and didn't deserve to win the title. Teddy Long makes up for her horridness with some comedy relief in this stinker of a match! B'LEDAT PLAYA! 2/10

Match #5 Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio: What a squash!!! Rey gets some offense in, but Big Show destroys this little weasel with one of the most wicked chokeslams I think I have ever seen. Then takes the stretcher Rey is on and smashes it against the turnbuckle!!! Way to go Show!!! 10/10

Match #6 Brock Lesnar (c) vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship: I was surprised that Cena even got this title shot. I wish he would go back to being a heel like he was here! Brock wins after an awesome match, to retain his title. For the record, Brock sucks!!! 9/10

Match #7 Kevin Nash, HBK, & Booker T vs. HHH, Ric Flair, & Y2J in a 6 man tag match: How did this make it higher on the card then the WWE championship? This was the worst match of the night with horrible performances by all these great talents! Booker T should have been World Champ here, but we know the HH would never job to the Bookman. Kevin Nash and Jericho also deserve much better then this! Well the heels win here, LAME!!!

0/10

Match #8 Rock vs. Goldberg: I'm glad this was the main event, but it was way too short. Rock basically got man-handled where it could have been a brawl. But they feel they had to sell Goldberg as a dominator, when really most of the talent on both brands is much better then him! Well Goldberg wins and Rock goes to make more movies...Welcome to the WWE Goldberg...1 year later...see ya Goldberg! 7/10

1882664,2,B00009AV94,"""Backlash"" was a horrible PPV with one of the most overhyped matches in WWE history.

1. Shelton Benjamin & Charile Haas vs. Los Guerrero's (WWE Tag Titles)

Decent way to kick off the show.  It was the second best match of the night in my opinion.  Good, exciting finish.  (7.5/10)

2. Sean O'Haire vs. Rikishi

WWE tried to bring up O'Haire by using Piper in his corner.  It is just too bad things didn't work out for a O'Haire.  He had a good look and the talent.  Not much for the match itself.  Cool finisher by O'Haire.  (6.5/10)

3. Rob Van Dam & Kane vs. The Dudley Boys (World Tag Titles w/ Chief Morley as Guest Referee)

Val Venis was horrible in the role as Morley.  I thought this was the best match of the night, although that is not saying much.  Good match, just a little short.  (7.5/10)

4. Jazz vs. Trish Stratus (Women's Title)

Who cares.  (2/10)

5. Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio

I knew this would be alright because Big Show was going to toss Mysterio around.  The match itself is not bad, but very short.  The aftermath is awesome.  Mysterio is placed onta a stretcher and Big Show picks it up and swings it at the ring post with Mysterio on it and he falls on his head.  Pretty cool stuff.  (7/10)

6. Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena (WWE Title)

This was Cena's first big match in the WWE.  Although it wasn't the best title match, Cena and Lesnar put on a good performance.  These two could have had a great fued had Lesnar not quit.  (7/10)

7. Booker T, Shawn Michaels, & Kevin Nash vs. Triple H, Ric Flair, Chris Jericho (Six Man Tag)

This match was filled with talent and superstars.  It was good, but could have been a lot better.  Basically, this match was put in so Triple H and Nash could continue their fued.  (7.5/10)

8. The Rock vs. Goldberg

This was one of the most overhyped matches in history.  It was nice of The Rock to stick around for an extra month, but they should have saved this for a bigger PPV.  The crowd actually cheers The Rock and boos Goldberg.  It basically sums up Goldberg's WWE career.

Do not buy this DVD.  The matches are horrible.  The crowd is dead.  It was a disaster.

1882670,3,B00009AV94,"Backlash was a slight dissapointment following Wrestlmania X1X. allthough it had the dream match involving the rock and goldberg, and both of the tag team matches, this ppv was a complete waste of money.

The match between the guerroes and team angle was fast paced and a good opener besides the cheap win by team angle at the end. However the guerroes get their revenge by stealing the tag titles. 9/10

The match between Big show and rey mysterio. you knew who would win when you saw this on the card. For those of you who thought rey mysterio would win are wishing you didn't take that bet. Shocking ending when rey was on the stretcher. 7/10

Rikishi vs. Sean o' Haire was a joke, it lasted less than 10 minutes. Sean o' Haire has left the wwe {Thank God} and Rikishi is gone too {he dissapeared after wrestlmania 20} 5/10 {this match deserved less, but I'm a nice guy}

John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar sucked too. It was too long and too boring. Lesnar was the biggest loser I ever saw and didn't even last two years in the wwe. John Cena was as annoying as ever, but at least he wasn't screaming yo, yo, yo, yo, yo back then. Lesnar wins.  7/10

The match between the dudleys and Rvd and kane was a good match. I wish kane and Rvd would get back together,they were a good tag team in my opinion. {If you don't like it you can stick it.}Lots of high flying moves and the excitement was overwhelming. 8/10

Trish vs Jazz was bad, especially with theodore long next to the ring. I couldn't believe the ending and what caused it. 6/10

Triple H,Ric Flair,Chris Jericho vs. HBK,Booker T,and Kevin Nash

Now if only this was made a table elimination match, oh well {sigh} This was still a pretty good match. Allthough it was kinda long. Just watch it everyonce in a while. 8/10

The main event was goldberg vs. the rock and even though the crowd was in the rocks corner most of the time Goldberg whips the rock's Candya** throughout the entire match. goldberg is one of my favorite wrestlers and I am still looking forward to him returning. 10/10",1091923200,2,2041,4.404255319148936
1882671,3,B00009AV94,"Team Angle vs Los Guerros-Exellent opener for Backlash 2003. These are 2 great tag teams and when you put them together there is always explosions. Los Guerros were on top of team angle for most of the match but Team Angle retain the tag team gold by cheating. 8/10
Rikishi vs Sean O,Haire-Was not a very good match. The match was too short and didn't have much action until Rikishi smashed the coconut on Pipers head. Piper got what he deserved. Somehow O,Haire beat the 400 pounder with pipers destraction. 6/10
Trish vs Jazz-How many times do they want to show this match?This was probably one of their best encounters but I am still sick of seing this match up. Ending was awful when Theodore Long through his shoe at Trish and Jazz took advantage to win the match. 5/10
Rey Mysterio vs Show-The smallest guy on the roster vs the biggest guy on the roster. There was never a way Mysterio could have won even after 3 straight 619's. Ending was terrifying with Big Show catching Mysterio and chokeslamming him from 7 feet high. Okay match better than I expected. 6/10
Kane/RVD vs Dudleys-Great tag team contest. I was impressed RVD and Kane were still able to win after Cheif Morley was always on the Dudleys side. Had some high flying moves from RVD and was very entertaining to watch Cheif Morleys decions. 8/10
Triple H,Flair,Y2J VS Kevin Nash,HBK and Booker T-Brilliant match!!!.Was 20 monutes long and had loads of personal match ups between all six wrestlers. The match was bloody and after it had finished every one was brused and battered. Triple H got the victory for his team by cheating,using the sledgehammer on Kevin Nash. 9.5/10
Lesnar vs John Cena-Great match. Cena was on top for the whole match making Lesnar bleed but Lesnars will to keep the title guided him to victory with the F5. Cena used some great moves and was entertaining and Lesnar played his part well aswell. 8/10
The Rock vs Goldberg-Slow paced for most of the match. Neither man was going for the other. Goldberg wins his 1st match in the WWE after a spear and a jackhammer.okay match for the second half of it. Rock should have won though. 7/10
Back lash 2003 was okay. It had some good matches but also had some terrible ones. I think last years Backlash was better. If your a true wrestling fan buy this DVD for the good matches on it. overall rating-57.5/80

1882672,3,B00009AV94,"slight disappointment to follow wrestlemania. i understand a lot of the stars were injured, but could have done better. no angle,austin, edge, benoit,undertaker or hogan. dvd extras are good especially rock after ppv went off the air.
team angle vs guerreros 7/10- good match with suprise afterwards
o' haire vs rikishi 3/10- should have been better buildup especially with piper involved. rikishi looks fatter.
van dam & kane vs dudleys 9/10- best match of backlash. great ending. this match stole the show.
trish vs jazz 4/10- not the best of these two. good to see teddy long back. great character
show vs mysterio 5/10- would have been lower if not for post match shocker. show proves nothing here beating up guy half his size. 5'3 vs 7'? give me a break. rey could have ended his career prematurely
lesnar vs cena 8/10- thought this would be a squash. really impressed with cena's performance. has a future in wwe.
tripple hhh, jericho & flair vs michaels, nash & booker 6/10- should have been a lot better. nash shows ring rust. flair is shell of his once great shelf. booker really shines in this match after wrestlemania disappointment.
rock vs goldberg 5/10- this is a main event? didn't have feel of one. goldberg looks rusty after 2 yr layoff. rock holds back. for the hype , i was very disappointed. this match should have been held until summerslam, giving goldberg time to get back in sync.",1077235200,2,1404,4.758196721311475

Tag Team Title Match: Los Guerros vs. Team Angle (champions) 7.75 since the match was entertaining, but the Guerros lost.
Rikishi vs. Sean O Haire (w/Roddy Piper)8 because it was fun to watch Piper get what he deserved, but no stinkface? DAMN!!
Women's Championship Match: Trish Stratus (champion) vs. Jazz (w/Theodore Long) 1 because the match sucked, Jazz had faced Trish way too many times before, plus the match was short.
Tag Team Title Match: Kane & RVD (champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz with Chief Morley as the special guest referee. 10 because I was impressed when I saw Kane & RVD defeat the Dudleys when Morley was helping the Dudleys the whole time.
Rey Mysterio vs. The Big Show. 2 since it was almost obvious that the Big Show would win, plus, the ending of the match was horrifying.
WWE championship match: Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena. 9.75 since the match was EXTREMELY high quality, but my favorite guy John Cena lost (Cena had Lesnar beat at one point in the match)
Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels, & Booker T vs. Triple H, Ric Flair, & Chris Jericho. 4 Since Triple H cheated to win, plus the match wasn't very entertaining.
The Rock vs. Goldberg. 10 because it was Goldberg's first PPV in the WWE and he made a BIG impact by defeating The Rock.
Overall, this is an AWESOME PPV and you should definently buy it.",1071187200,,1390,4.564

1882675,3,B00009AV94,Backlash 2003 was average. The Rock vs. Goldberg was a huge let down. The 6-man tag match was okay. Sean o Haire vs. Rikishi was absoluetly horrible. The only match that I really enjoyed was Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena. It was truly a great back and forth match with lots of action. Overall I think you should buy Backlash 2003 if you want to see a great match between John Cena and Brock Lesnar. Other than thought I do not recommend Backlash 2003.,1069113600,,448,4.345238095238095
1882676,4,B00009AV94,"Usually, Backlash is one of the weaker PPV's of the year. It's not really the PPV itself that's a let down it's just that it follows Wrestlemania and their is really nothing that can follow such an enormous ppv. Plus, Backlash is always dealing with the ramifications of the things that happened at Backlash. However, the last two years the WWF/WWE have tried to seperate themselves from the Backlash norm by making huge mainevents. Last year it was Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs HHH for the Undisputed Title and this year it's The Rock vs. Goldberg.
Los Guerreros vs Team Angle for the WWE Tag Team Championship-A solid match and a good opener. Eddie Guerrero is by far one of the most entertaining things that the WWE has going. The match itself was fun to watch and overall had nothing that majorly distracted from the action that took place in the ring. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.
Rikishi vs Sean O'Haire w/Rowdy Roddy Piper-It's nice to see the WWE using a veteran like Roddy Piper to push a mid-card star. I say mid-card about Sean O'Hair because he has been around a while. Well, this match is as good as can be expected seeing as how it came from a feud involving coconuts that started almost 20 years ago. A PPV squash match that does not make the squasher look important. Good to see the WWE trying to push O'Haire, but even that cannot save this match. 6 out of 10 stars.
Kane/Rob Van Dam vs The Dudley Boyz for the World Tag Team Championships w/Chief Morley as the Special Referee-Kane and RVD made decent tag champs, but the Dudleyz playing the reluctant heels just didn't work. Chief Morley's character had worn thin by this time and apparently the WWE realized it because shortly after the character was scrapped. Not as good or entertaining as the WWE Tag Team Titles Match, but nothing overall horrible either. 7 out of 10 stars.
Jazz w/Theodore Long vs Trish Stratus for the Women's Championship-For some reason the WWE feels the need to push that Jazz is practically unbeatable. Trish has only beat her a couple of times and I believe the majority of them were because Jazz was injured. Well, Jazz isn't injured and they have placed her with Teddy Long's group. Obvious outcome, but a decent women's match. 7 out of 10.
Rey Mysterio vs The Big Show- At first I thought that they were going to push Rey Mysterio as the Giant Killer like he was billed in WCW after victories over Kevin Nash and the such. However, this is the WWE and The Big Show is probably double Kevin Nash's weight. Rey Mysterio puts on an entertaining match with The Big Show and his bumps are impressive especially the spot on the stretcher. 7 out of 10.
John Cena vs Brock Lesnar for the WWE Heavyweight Championship-This is like an OVW Classic. The Prototype(John Cena) vs. one half of the Minnesota Stretching Crew(Brock Lesnar/Shelton Benjamin). Just joking. Anyways, John Cena is coming into his own with his Thuganomics character. Good to see the WWE recognizing this and giving him a push. A solid match even though he didn't win. The WWE seems to lack major upsets, but for a while they did make it seem like Cena had a chance of beating Lesnar. A good match that hopefully, will have a rematch eventually. 8 out of 10.
Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels, and Booker T vs. Chris Jericho, Ric Flair and HHH-Well,Nash had just returned after Wrestlemania to find HBK and HHH going at it. Of course he goes right into a feud with HHH and leaves Booker T by the wayside. Oh wait for some reason he's thrown in here. This is a decent six man tag match that manages to avoide showing too many of Nash's weaknesses. 8 out of 10 stars.
The Rock vs Goldberg-The week's leading up to this match with the Rock and Goldberg were hillarious. The Rock bringing in Gillberg and the such made for some entertaining television. The match itself was decent. Goldberg isn't a very solid wrestler and it shows in this match. The Rock may be an entertainer, but he can wrestler. Goldberg's style is almost a mix of MMA and mat wrestling. That's makes matches with him seem disjointed. The Rock pulls him to a decent match, but nothing spectacular and definately a let down for what was supposed to be another in The Rock's series of ""I Never Imagined it Could Happen"" matches. 7 out of 10.
Overall, a decent rebound after Wrestlemania, but a weak ppv. Some nice extras on the dvd mainly centering around Goldberg and a bonus match from Sunday Night Heat. If you're like me then you would buy it no matter what. A PPV is a PPV and if you didn't see it when it aired then it's better to get it on dvd.",1066089600,,4565,4.494584837545126

1882682,1,B00009AV94,"Here are the themes changed from the original in the DVD:
-Dudley Boyz
-Rob Van Dam
-Kane
-Ric Flair
-Booker T
Jonathan Coachman aka ""The Coach"" and Jerry ""The King"" Lawler do the RAW commentary, while Michael Cole and Tazz cover SmackDown!
Ok these are my feelings and not neccessarily the feelings of everyone in the world.
Backlash 2003 is an extended RAW or SmackDown TV event without the breaks of commercials that you sit watching, but can't wait for it to end. The messed up theme ruins it to a point too. why can't WWE shell out the extra bucks to keep the DVDS straight!? There is no break out match.
Everything from Jazz's way of winning the Women's Title to Rock's pre-match promo and everything inbetween, before, after & all-around, [was bad]!
The new Goldberg music is horrible. Just classic WWE and McMahon trying to put his stamp on everything! The change was not needed. The Rock vs. Goldberg actually wasn't that bad. The theme by ""Cold"" was [bad]!
Best thing is ""The Rock after Backlash"" DVD Extra. After Backlash went off the air, you see Rock selling the beating Rock took from Goldberg. He puts over Goldberg and the spear's huge. It takes him forever to get to his feet and even o his feet he's still holding his abdomin.
The pay-per-view was very disappointing. Has to be the worst Backlash to date. The 6 Man Tag was leading nowhere. It seemed to have no point. The character's didn't seem in to it. Just out there to do there cause they were supposed to be. Like a lot of the rest of the matches. Brock vs. Cena was even very disapponting. It reminded me of some of the worst pay-per-views of the wrestle... 1995 era, a bad year for the WWF.
WrestleMania XIX was so awesome. No Way Out was so good too. It had the after RAW return of Stone Cold Steve Austin. And Royal Rumble was good as well. Except TripleH/Steiner. And now Backlash was real ...Bad. Terrible..
While watching it, all I could think of was that I wanted it to end. I hate that the themes are changed too. Don't know what that Booker T ... was.
The DVD is a waste of money. I should return or exchange it, but I need to get the box set I want.
None of the matches had any real build-up, except the Rock vs. Goldberg, which the WWE was obviously building up as the big-time match-up for the card. And Goldberg was built up wrong for it. Rock didn't do even close as good a job building up Goldberg than as he did The Hurricane. He should of been portrayed more as the heel to the crowd than he was.
Bottom Line: Don't waste your money on this ... Put you money to better use like the ""From The Vault: Shawn Michaels"" DVD.",1056758400,6,2612,4.354508196721311
1882683,3,B00009AV94,"I don't think this PPV deserves the hype that it has been receiving, but for what it's worth, it's wasn't that bad. It was one of those experimental ppv's. What I mean by that is tha WWE put in some new faces and new storylines to see if they work.
In some areas they did well in some areas but failed in others.
The good matches on the card was Brock Lesnar vs John Cena. I have always been impressed with Cena's wrestling ability and I'm glad to see him get a push even if the gimmick's a little lame. The match wasn't quite as good as the Angle/Lesnar match at WrestleMania but they still worked well together. Kane/RVD vs The Dudleys was a good match as well and with Cheif Morley as the special guest referee made it more entertaining to watch. Morley tried to screw RVD and Kane but it backfired and even got the 3-D from the Dudleys for his troubles. Bubba Ray received a chokeslam and the 5 star frog splash after the 3-D. The six man tag was decent. Everyone did get some quality wrestling time in the match. Nash looked like he has cleared up some ring rust and Flair put up a decent performance for someone who hasn't competed in a ppv since October. But the match could've been better. Los Guerreros vs Team Angle wasn't that great of a match but on an entertainment value, it was good. Guerreros lived up to their family motto and that is lying, cheating, and stealing as they making more illegal tags than I could keep count. Team Angle won when Haas pinned Chavo and Benjamin held on to his legs. Team Angle came out to a portrait of Kurt with gold medals in honor of Kurt during his neck surgery. As they were celebrating, Guerreros attacked them and stole the tag team titles and the antics afterwards was hilarous! The rest of the card was not that good!

Other good matches were Lesnar/Cena though I was disappointed that the WWE did not push Cena by making him give Lesnar a tougher match.

7990477,3,B00009AV94,"In a way, Backlash 2003 was a big event for the WWE that year: not only did it feature both major titles on the line, but it also featured a true blockbuster special attraction match between one of the biggest stars in WCW making his WWE debut against the biggest wrestling icon ever in The Rock. For the WWE, this seemed like a big deal even coming off their stellar WrestleMania 19 the month before. It's just unfortunate the event, as a whole, didn't deliver.

First, the good parts: the tag teams knocked it out of the park here with two awesome tag team titles matches. Smackdown jerked the curtain with a very good, psychological encounter between Los Guerreros and the World's Greatest Tag Team. RAW followed it up with Rob Van Dam and Kane defending the title against the Dudley Boys in a different yet equally satisfying contest.

The bad news is that nothing else really stood out; Brock Lesnar's title match against John Cena was solid, though nothing to write home about, and RAW's Title was wrapped up in a dull six-man tag match that wasted talent like Jericho, Michael's and Flair to prime the pump for the impending Nash/Triple H feud.

The main event between The Rock and Goldberg wasn't a technical classic, but it gave the fans just enough to be a satisfying capper for the evening. With two guys that are known more for their personalities than their wrestling, this match mostly played to their strengths. And that's the best way to describe this event: it did just enough to satisfy and nothing more. A very mild Recommendation.",1410220800,,1550,4.670329670329671

7990479,5,B00009AV94,Growing up in the late nineties during the Monday Night Wars a fan could only dream about seeing WCW and WWE superstars go at. I always wanted to see this match. The match is short but still great and memorable. It was a great way to introduce Goldberg into WWE. Another great match on this card is John Cena vs Brock Lesnar. This was before John Cena became the guy in WWE. Lesnar was the man then. These two put on a great match. For all you Goldberg fans WWE is producing a best of Goldberg dvd coming out in the summer so watch out for that!,1359331200,,545,4.102803738317757

WWE Tag Team Title Match: Los Guerreros vs. Team Angle (Champions): Its a good classic tag team match as Team Angle had only been on the main roster a few months and already had some good matches. Good wrestling holds, good double teaming and some funny antics by Eddie make this an entertaining match. The momentum swings back and forth, Eddie comes in and hits the frog splash, Chavo makes the cover but Benjamin stops the count. Chavo picks up Haas for a spulex, Shelton grabs Chavo's leg from the outside and Haas falls on top of him for the 3 count to retain their titles. 7/10. Good post match antics with the Guerrero's stealing the tag team titles and celebrating even though they lost.

-Sean O'Haire w/Roddy Piper vs. Rikishi: I forgot all about O'Haire's run with Piper as it was sadly cut short then Sean was released a bit later. As for this its a short match, Rikishi takes it ot Sean slamming him into the steel steps then takes it to him in the ring. Sean comes back applying a neck crank and hitting kicks to the back, Rikishi does get a measure of revenge on Piper cracking a coconut over Roddy's head. However Sean hits a unique reverse slam and covers him for the win. 4/10.

-World Tag Team Championship Match, Kane & RVD (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz, Special Guest Referee, Chief Morley: Not a bad one just average, and there is good action between the four, RVD shines with his unique set of kicks then Kane comes in and throws around D'Von, hits a nice big boot for two. The Dudley's take over working on RVD's neck and back with a camel clutch and keep him on the mat but can't keep him down for three. RVD hits Rolling Thunder, but gets a huge neck breaker out of the corner from D'Von, Kane goes for a chokeslam then Morley hits a lowblow on Kane but he doesn't stay down for three. Sean accidentaly hits Bubba with a clothesline then D'Von starts punching out Morley, Lance Storm comes in, hits a clothesline then gets the Bubba Bomb, Morley gets the 3D, Kane hits a chokeslam, RVD hits the frog splash, another ref comes down and counts to three as Kane & RVD retain. 5/10.

-WWE Women's Championship Match, Trish Stratus (Champion) vs. Jazz w/Theodore Long: Nice heelish promo from Teddy as he says Jazz will rise to new heights and become the new Women's champion. Quick one, Trish tries to roll up Jazz early but only for two, Jazz takes over working on Trish's back with a backbreaker and clubbing blows to the back. There's some good counter wrestling with Trish getting a nice boston crab in, but Jazz hits a big dropkick for two. Trish hits Stratusfaction, but Teddy throws his shoe at her to break up the pinfall, Jazz reverses a sunset flip, holds the ropes and pins Trish to become the new champion. 5/10.

-Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio: We have another quick one here, Rey hits some good quick moves but eventually gets caught and receives a big chokeslam, Show makes the cover and wins. 5/10. The post match is more memorable as Rey is being stretchered out but Show comes back, picks up the stretcher and slams it into the ring post and drops Mysterio face first into the outside mat.

-WWE Championship Match, Brock Lesnar (Champion) vs. John Cena: This had some good albeit quickly put together hype and is quite a good match between two young stars. Love the pre-match promo from Cena as he was in full heel mode here and he rammed Lesnar into the turnbuckle, hitting some good elbows but Brock hit two backbreakers then a fallway slam and some good mat wrestling as he schooled Cena early on. He beat John up in and out of the ring, but he gets driven into the steel steps by Cena who starts working on Brock's head busting him open and also his neck with clubbing blows and a leg drop from the second rope drilling his neck into the ring rope. Later Brock kicks out of the FU, then hits the F-5 and covers Cena to retain. Great match, 9/10.

-Six-Man Tag Team Match, Chris Jericho, Ric Flair & Triple H vs. Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels & Booker T: Given the star power and the rivalries between a few of these men, you would expect a great tag match, however while good in parts it wasn't a great co-main event PPV caliber match. Shawn and Jericho had some good action between them, playing off their Wrestlemania XIX match and throughout the early part Nash kept trying to get Triple H to face him. Booker T has a good showing here also as he was still obviously upset over getting screwed out of the World Title at Wrestlemania. The ending of the match is bedlam as Nash takes it to Flair and Jericho, but gets a sledgehammer to the head, Triple H makes the cover and wins the match for his team. 7/10.

-The Rock vs. Goldberg: I'm gonna say it, this wasn't a great all-time classic, Rock oversold like crazy to Goldberg but also got some good moves in, hitting a couple of spears of his own but he couldn't keep Goldberg down for three. Goldberg even hit a Rock Bottom of his own, Rock came back with a couple of his own even the People's Elbow. The crowd's reactions do help add to the match as they booed Goldberg and cheered Rock, Goldberg ends up hitting another spear then the Jackhammer for the win. 6/10, mainly for the Rock's reactions/antics and the crowd.
