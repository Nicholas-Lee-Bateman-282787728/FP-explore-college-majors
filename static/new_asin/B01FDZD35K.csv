8760659,5,B01FDZD35K,Teepa is the absolute authority on proper dementia care. Everyone dealing with a loved one's needs should watch this.,1488499200,,117,5.2105263157894735
8760660,3,B01FDZD35K,"Four parts of this video are  good.  One part does not apply to home health care, as it explains a complex SARA lift which is a two person, lifting and transferring device.  The four parts that apply utilize a compliant care worker, or actress, acting as a patient.  My loved one is on late stage dementia.  She has severe agitation and anger, which manifest in vigorous verbal and physical combativeness.  To avoid strains and sprains to my back, due to her vigorous combativeness, I wear a high quality back brace during transfers.  To avoid forearm pinches and bisep bites, I also wear a motorcycle jacket during transfers.  Sometimes she pulls hair and some times she strikes with her fist.  The difference between Teepa Snow and her trainee working with a compliant actress, and my working with my wife is the difference between day and night.  Overall, I am satisfied with the video despite is high cost.",1469836800,,910,4.7756410256410255
