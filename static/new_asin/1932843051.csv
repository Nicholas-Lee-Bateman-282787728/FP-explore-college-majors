7801590,1,1932843051,This DVD is for the nearly dead. Too slow and lost interest immediately. I would not recommend it to anyone under 80.,1331251200,,117,4.363636363636363
7801591,1,1932843051,"I am very new to Dahn Yoga and take a class through my local junior college.  I wanted something I could use at home for practice and something that would advance my understanding.  It looks like this was originally filmed in Korean and dubbed over in English, losing all the details in translation.  For example, when they tell you to rub your belly, my teacher always emphasizes rubbing in a clockwise direction, an important detail missing from this program.  Further, it's short . . . only 35 minutes.  They start out with 12 Meridian stretches, which are not all of them, but give you no details so you're just parroting the movements of the people on stage but you're not gaining an appreciation of the sophistication and subtlety of Dahn Yoga.  Next they take you through Jung-Choong Breathing posture #1 (not the other 4) with no true explanation of the key concept of the Dahn-Jon.  Finally, they take you through a Ji-Gam meditation for feeling energy followed by ""Dahnhak Kigong"", which appears related to DahnMuDo but again are not all the movements.  I don't think this gives a beginning viewer the necessary details.  I'd suggest the book, ""Dahn Yoga Basics"" by Ilchi Lee and the DVD, ""Dahn Yoga Essentials"" by Dawn Quaresima.  The extra details will be more helpful to a beginner.",1268265600,16,1295,4.792792792792793
7801592,5,1932843051,I really loved this video.  The practice was simple and profound.  I found it easy to follow and even to apply in my day to day life.,1255478400,2,133,3.888888888888889
7801593,3,1932843051,there are only 3 segments on the tape.  It is very clear but I think the content can be a lot longer.,1215993600,2,101,3.590909090909091
7801594,5,1932843051,Came in a very timely manner. It came in perfect condition. it was a great price.,1200700800,,81,4.125
7801595,4,1932843051,"I am a member of a Dahn Yoga center and I wanted the video for days when I couldn't get to classes. I was both pleased and somewhat disappointed with the video. While the exercises on the video were done extremely well, I felt that the time devoted to each segment was way too short. I would recommend stopping the tape and doing the exercises for longer that the brief time they show if you want to get more benefit from the video.

The setting of the video was very pleasant and peaceful. The explanations of the movements were excellent and easy to follow. I really appreciated that when they would say turn to the left (or right) that you were actually following the direction they were moving, and not THEIR left (or right). So many exercise tapes tell you to move to one direction and they are not doing it in a mirror image so you are actually aimed in the opposite direction and I find those videos confusing, so I was very pleased that Dahn Yoga for Beginners made it so easy to follow the directional movements.

I would hope that Dahn Yoga would produce several videos with each video concentrating on different exercises and allowing plenty of time for each exercise, but I felt that overall this was a wonderful video and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a Tai Chi-type exercise. It is more like Tai Chi than traditional yoga, so please keep that in mind as well.

It would also be beneficial for people to take an actual Dahn Yoga class at a Dahn Yoga center to better acquaint themselves to this style of yoga and to see how the video and the class differs. I am not affiliated with Dahn, and I am only suggesting trying a class at least once. Hope my 2 cents was helpful to you.",1180396800,9,1700,4.3734177215189876
