2888567,5,B000SOUO2W,This video was purchased for 2 Sr. Citizens who don't venture from their home very much.  They had seen part of it on TV and told me about it so I bought it for them.  They are thrilled and have watched it 3 times already.  It is a very inspirational video and well worth the price.,1298505600,,282,4.0

8206205,5,B000SOUO2W,"This for us is a great older style movie with nothing flashy. A man thinking back and reminiscing his Early Childhood Days and  the struggles of not having a mother, but a wonderful grandmother that believed in him. A loving but strong-willed father,  and the little boys connection with great and wonderful holy spiritual advisors along the way that made him the man that he is today. The gentle correction to the dad by the priest when found drinking, is a wonderful Insight how fraternal correction should be done and as a Dad myself we should accept an at least think about spiritual corrections. Great great movie for young  children.  Simple ,nothing fancy, our forever Christmas favorite.",1485302400,3,695,4.914529914529915
