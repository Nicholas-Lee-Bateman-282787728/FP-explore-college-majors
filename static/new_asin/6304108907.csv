7861735,4,6304108907,"Thanks to other reviews, I knew that this was the only episode in the series
in which Lynda Carter did not appear.  I missed her character, but the female
lead in this one was very good.  Apparently this particular story line needed
someone a little tougher, and ultimately, one who could leave at the end.  The
highlight was Hawleye's powerful determination to keep his word and maintain his
integrity, even if it cost him his life.  We need men like that today!  Oh how I
wish this series would come out on DVD.",1265760000,,513,4.473118279569892
7861736,4,6304108907,"This is the first episode of this series that I had ever seen.  The opening scene is a contest of skill in horsemanship, marksmanship and something else that leads to the underlying theme of this episode.  I kept  wondering as I watched the openning action montage, who played the lead,  Hawkeye, AKA Nathaniel Bumpo of the ""Leatherstockings"" series of  books dating back to the days of Melville and Moby Dick (or some time  after).  I suddenly realized that it was Lee Horsley, who I enjoyed  watching in his role as Ethan Allen Cord in the western series,  ""Paradise.""  I was hooked.  This episode has some of the most  dynamic action scenes that this series produced and some of the most  memorable.  I had not seen Lee Horsley in a role like this since ""The  Sword and the Sorcerer.""
Interestingly, this is the only episode  of the series without Lynda Carter in her staring role as the heroine,  Elizabeth Shields.  What keeps bringing me back to viewing this episode is  Jill Teeds, who plays a character so much like the Shields character, yet  is different in manner and delivery.  This woman plays the strong lead  effectively and is quite fascinating.  In one sequence she is disgusted  with men and in need of help -- she rolls her eyes, tosses her head, snaps  her neck to back and to the side -- leading her to see Rodney A. Grant as  Hawkeye's friend and native brother, Chingachgook in a classice and  memorable ""noble savage"" stance.  Another example of the dramatic  direction in this episode.
Jill Teed plays a lot of supporting roles and  I hope that she will continue to act and appear in TV and movie productions  (most recent is ""Mission to Mar"").  She is one of the many  reasons to see this episode.",961200000,7,1723,4.599337748344371
