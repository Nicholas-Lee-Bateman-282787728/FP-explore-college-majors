The story of Frankenstein's Monster came from a novel by Mary Shelley in the early 19th century. Stories about vampires and werewolves go back centuries in folk legends that have no authors. These movies are digitally enhanced for clarity and contrast, they are much better than anything you saw on videotapes. One book said Frankenstein symbolized the Great Depression that plagued the nation and the world. Only by uniting could the people destroy the monster and the castle that produced it. The horror movies of the 1930s to early 1940s ended by 1945 with victory in war. Note the difference in the portrayal of the Monster and the other persons.

""Frankenstein"" (1931) was the first adaption of the novel. The Monster is eliminated after the people attack the baron's castle. Baron Frankenstein's marriage promises happiness for the village (and another sequel). Was it a warning against weird science?

""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) tells how the Monster survived and how the village people tried to capture him. The body of a young woman is used to provide a mate for the Monster. Can they propagate a new race of manufactured beings? Things don't go as planned. Will they survive the destruction of the tower?",1351036800,,1261,5.023923444976076
7965673,5,B000069I3G,"I have come to the conclusion that the 1931 production of ""Frankenstein"" is one of the ten most important films of the 20th century. The rationale behind this is simply that director James Whale's film version of the story of Frankenstein has almost completely replaced Mary Shelley's novel in the popular mind. Culturally the novel was important because it represented the paradigm shift away from magic and religion (represented by the Faust myth) to that of science. I have taught ""Frankenstein"" the novel several times and it was clear to me that the key question of the novel was which was Frankenstein's greater crime: creating the creature or abandoning it? For me the answer had always been the later, that Frankenstein had played god and then abandoned his ""Adam."" However, in this celebrated film version Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) does not abandon the creature (Boris Karloff), although he does get away and accidentally drowns Little Maria. But escape is not the same thing as being abandoned. Consequently, the question I raised in class is moot and instead of provoking profound philosophical debate the movie codifies the dictum that there are some things man was not made to tamper with. This particular proposition can be traced back at least to the story of the Tower of Babel, but you can also find it in the tragedy of the Titanic.
Meanwhile, back in the real world people ""play god"" all the time; not by reanimating dead tissue but with all sorts of medical and technological advances that should not be abandoned by their creators anymore than the creature. However, the debate, if it exists, is no longer held on a public level and the fault for, dear Brutus, I find in this film. We watch the film for Jack Pierce's stunning make-up job and Karloff's haunting performance, as well as the maniacal exultation of Clive's mad doctor screaming ""It's alive! It's alive!"" (the most famous line in a horror film ever?). But the film has had a profound cultural impact. It is perhaps not merely ironic but appropriately symbolic that the film ends in fire while the novel ends in ice and that the term Frankenstein is commonly used to mean the creature rather than the doctor, for the lesson of the character and the novel have both been replaced by the face you see on the cover of this videotape.
The idea that the classic Universal film version of ""Frankenstein"" replaced Mary Shelley's novel is pretty ironic given that the authoress herself appears in the prologue to the 1935 sequel ""The Bride of Frankenstein.""  Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), and Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) are sitting around on a dark and stormy night and having apparently narrated the events of the first film, Mary tells her audience that the collapse of the windmill was not the end of the story and that both Dr. Frankenstein and the monster have both survived.  The doctor has learned the error of his ways and wants to stop tampering with the forces of life, but his wife, Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) is kidnapped by Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), an even madder mad scientist if ever there was one.  Alone Frankenstein created a man; together they will create a mate for the monster, a bride (also played by Lanchester).
The 1931 film is more significant in terms of movie and cultural history, but the 1935 sequel is the better film.  This is mainly because it is much more polished and the performances are not so over the top.  However, while the film works perfectly well on its own it has been reinterpreted in light of Whale's homosexuality, which became part of the cultural landscape with the 1998 biopic ""Gods and Monsters.""  Critics like Gary Morris are not alone in now seeing ""Bride of Frankenstein"" as a bold gay parable, especially given that Thesiger was also openly gay in the Hollywood of the 1930s and that his performance is pure high camp.  However, you can enjoy the film perfectly without working out the idea that the monster and his bride have a pair of male parents.
I do think that it is important to see both films and to appreciate the key differences between the two works.  To do so you only have to look at a pair of memorable scenes.  In the 1931 film this would be the scene where the monster comes across little Maria (Marilyn Harris), throwing daisies in the lake and he accidentally drowns her as they play together.  In the 1935 sequel the key scene is when the monster comes upon the hermit (O.P. Heggie) living alone in quiet solitude and finds a friend.  Both scenes represent the apotheosis of pathos in their respective films, but they also indicate great irony of how the more human the monster becomes, the wider the gulf that is created between him and humanity.  Even as a master metaphor of current age the saga of the Frankenstein monster remains a very human story as well, and it draws its enormous narrative power from both.",1082246400,,4911,4.764705882352941
