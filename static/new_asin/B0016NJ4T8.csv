8263546,3,B0016NJ4T8,"ok rendition of supremely intoxicating subject matter.  This production manages to make the Cliffs of Moher mundane:  mediocre-to-poor quality production diminishes this august geographic formation to some holiday road-trip point-of-interest.  Background music, while beautiful, should have been coupled with natural sounds like gulls cawing, sea mist spraying, etc.  Lighting is one-dimensional and fairly void of atmosphere.  Sound is muddy; image is out-of-focus sometimes.  It's like it's been neutered (or I got a bad copy).  Ireland is a georgeous country, and the Cliffs of Moher are particularly iconic in terms of the beauty and the terror they embody, but this tame view is a disservice.  Better to have given the project to some film/theatre students who would have invested some heart.",1365465600,,797,5.583333333333333
