3653936,5,B001JAHQAM,"This was a great classic show. They finally released season 12. I'm waiting to buy it because I have been spending way to much money lately, but I plan to buy all the seasons of gunsmoke, once I have saved the money. I hope they don't take to long to release season 13, and I hope they release it in one volume. They are in the color episodes now, and in those days gunsmoke did not have as many episodes per season as it once did, so I don't see a point to releasing the seasons in two volumes from now on. To be honest they should have released every season in single volumes like they did with season 1.",1475625600,22,606,4.058333333333334
8312339,5,B001JAHQAM,I know a CBS studio DVD remastering exec (now retired) and this next set seasons 13 vol 1 & 2 will be released may 22nd 2018 and he has told me several times that it takes between 1 and 2 years to remaster these as they don't go to the existing prints they will and always will look for the original negative prints for the upmost and best picture possible because CBS will not release anything less then perfect it will cost but but you got to figure the cost they are paying for perfection. I just hop I am still alive to have the complete 20 years of this classic as I have all 12 so far.,1520899200,,591,4.016949152542373
8312340,1,B001JAHQAM,Five stars for the series one star for all the release games shame on you,1519776000,,73,3.933333333333333
8312341,1,B001JAHQAM,I think the whole series should be released.....come on CBS!  The one star is rating CBS not Gunsmoke.,1518048000,,102,4.666666666666667
8312342,1,B001JAHQAM,"If you never intend to release rest of Gunsmoke at least have the decency to let your faithful customers know.  If I ran my business like this, I would be bankrupt by now. Get with it!!!",1507593600,11,186,4.166666666666667
8312343,5,B001JAHQAM,I have to agree with Kent!!!! WHY is it taking so long to get these out?!!!!!,1497657600,15,77,3.875
8312344,5,B001JAHQAM,"When  I  had  cable  I  would  watch  this  show  on  TV  land  every  time  I  found  it.  Gunsmoke  is  close  to  the  best  there  is.  Festus  is  probably  my  favorite  character.  Season  13  is  a  good  season,  I  do  intend  to  buy  season  12  if  more  seasons  become  available.  I  would  not  only  like  this  season  to  come  out  on  DVD  but  also  seasons  14  &  15.  &  believe  me  I  know  its  worth  it.  People  do  enjoy  this  show.  I  watch  it  because  its  got  the  action.  Every  adventure  they  go  on  is  different.  Sometimes  its  just  Matt  in  the  episode  or  Festus,  you  don't  always  get  to  see  the  rest  of  the  characters.  The  bad  guys  they  all  face  easily  get  riled.  &  Matt  (James Arness)  Along  with  Newly (Buck Taylor)  &  Festus  (Ken Curtis)  have  got  no  choice  but  to  defy  them  &  remind  them  where  Law  &  order  stands.",1486857600,14,917,4.032679738562091
8312345,5,B001JAHQAM,"Gunsmoke.. Even today is still a top grade show, and i watched the reruns on TV for years! Seems releasing a season for CBS, takes an act of congress or something!!! But we the hard core fans, will gripe and complain until season 13 comes out. Cheer when it does, then we'll start gripping all over again, waiting for the next season. Lol WHY? Because ""By Golly"" we LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!",1485907200,17,384,4.422535211267606
8312346,5,B001JAHQAM,"Good grief, all of the other westerns from that era are out in their entirety (the Virginian, Bonanza, etc.). Wondering why the drip, drip,drip with Gunsmoke. At this rate I'll be dead before Season 13 is released.",1485475200,36,214,4.8108108108108105
8312347,5,B001JAHQAM,"I purchased season 12 as soon as it came out 1 and 2. It was just over $60 I could not wait to order. Please release season 13 no reason to hold it up, this is what your customers want. Thank you",1481414400,18,195,3.6666666666666665
