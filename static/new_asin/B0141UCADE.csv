8729349,2,B0141UCADE,"What I am about to write must be seen in the light of my great disappointment with Barrie Koskys interpretation of the three Monteverdi operas. I would not have bought them had it not been for my admiration of his later directions of Shostakovitchs The Nose and Handels Saul.  They're both colourful, high energy, imaginative interpretations which enhanced the written operas.  These were directed a couple of years before and perhaps he has learned to tone himself down.  But certainly not here.

I could go on at length, but with three operas, all different from each other, my review would be far too long.  So I will be mercifully brief.  Particularly since I cannot recommend them for anything other than curiosity.

I was somewhat disconcerted by the translation from Italian into German.  The new musical arrangement did not seem to my untutored experience to be what it is hyped up to be.  Admittedly it is more lush and expressive than many, but the augmented orchestra with Harnoncourt or the much richer arrangement by Henze are far better and more appropriate.  It is certainly not much of an advancement.

Lorpheo is overcrowded and frenetic in the first half, and relatively flat and sterile in the Underworld.  Ulysses is relatively static and boring.  Poppea is very disturbing.  Here Kosky wanted to show the violence and anomie and ruthlessness  but I feel he went far too far to the point where I turned off and left.

I kept going back to the 40 yr old productions by Ponelle and Harnoncourt which are still available.  They are considerably more imaginative, and considering that Orpheo was written primarily for the amusement of Monteverdis friends, and the latter two written for Festival, had a great deal of humour and lightness about them which certainly did not distract from the libretto.  Musically it is lush as I suppose Monteverdi would have like had he been able to afford a larger orchestra.  I have many different productions of the Monteverdi operas, and if you are interested in these historically important and theatrically enjoyable operas, The Harnoncourt/Ponnelle DVDs are the ones to get.",1492300800,2,2130,4.966101694915254
8729350,4,B0141UCADE,"Barrie Kosky's work is becoming more widely known in the UK from colourful, fresh and not entirely controversy-free productions of mainly Baroque opera.  As the director at Komische Oper in Berlin, his productions are no less radical, so would would expect then that their Monteverdi Trilogy (L'Orfeo, Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria and L'Incoronazione di Poppea) is going to be very different from any other versions of some of opera's earliest and greatest compositions. You don't know the half of it...

It's the Komische, so even Monteverdi is subjected to the German language treatment. That might sound strange to the ears were the works performed in an historically-informed way on period instruments, but remarkably the musical interpretation is just as ""translated"" here. While the melodic line and continuo is followed in as far as Monteverdi variously scored it for these works with theorbo and bass viol, composer Elena Kats-Chemin has introduced new instrumentation for all three works, including an accordion, a banjo and an electric guitar as well as a range of exotic instruments like the djoza from Iran, a West African kora (bridge-harp) and a Syrian oud (lute).

The familiar melodies and rhythmic structure is there, but less rigidly adhered to, blending into a much richer texture of plucked and hammered sounds that actually give a real kick to the arrangements. It's not just the colour of the instruments that is used either, but the melody can stray into a tango, into German jazz, Slavic folk, klezmer or ragtime swing. It might sound outrageous, but it gets across the wide dynamic of the tones within and across these works and is always appropriate to the context.  There's no one-size fits all though - each of the works has a distinct sound that is appropriate to the very different nature of each of the works.  The singing in German works with this adventurous approach, although it helps that the singing is of a very high standard right across each of the three works.

Needless to say, Barrie Kosky revels in the opportunities to match the colour and playful nature of the music with vividly bright, colourful productions that are inventive in situation on a busy stage that is usually a riot of dance and movement. Musically and in terms of staging, the trilogy is at its most elaborate in Orpheus (L'Orfeo), the stage filled with movement, with dancers and life-size puppets.  There's a rather more austere staging for Odysseus (Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria), with the orchestra to the back of the stage and the 'patria' a mostly bare green platform. The period is kind of late-60s/early-70s, with Penelope's sleazy suitors looking like they've just spilled out of a bar hoping to pick up a wealthy widow. Also minimally dressed, Poppea (L'Incoronazione di Poppea) nonetheless is filled with colour and movement, but all the violent and lustful passions result in some amount of violence and a lot of full-frontal nudity, mostly male.  Disappointingly however, the inventive musical reinterpretation is less evident and it isn't until quite late in the piece that the instrumentation finds the kind of rhythmic pulse that should drive Poppea.

The Blu-ray boxset slipcases each of the operas on separate individually-cased discs.  The quality of the visual aspect of the Blu-ray is fine, but there is a little bit of haziness to the image with some minor blurring in movement that is not as clinically sharp as most HD releases. The singing sounds a little amplified which might be down to the use of radio mics, although they are not obviously worn by the performers.  It's warmly toned however, and comes over well on the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and PCM stereo mixes, but best of all on headphones. Subtitles are in German, English, French and Turkish.  There are no extra feaures on the discs, but there are synopses and a great deal of information on the production in the large booklet that comes with the set.",1448409600,2,3953,4.972727272727273
