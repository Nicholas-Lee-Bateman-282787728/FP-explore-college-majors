Two noose hung in the middle of town, ready for its users Ben (Lorne Greene) and Adam (Pernell Roberts) Cartwright.  Yes, the Cartwrights had been accused of killing someone and the verdict is to hang by the neck.  In comes Lassiter (Vic Morrow) to the rescue.  He encountered Hoss and Little Joe in the stable and this is one time Vic gets to call someone else 'kid'.  Naturally Little Joe (Michael Landon) didn't take too kindly to a stranger calling him 'kid', and would have punched the stranger in the face had Hoss (Dan Blocker) not stepped in to prevent a fight.  Lassiter saved the day by convincing the dead man's daughter to retract her statement that she had witnessed his killing because she actually did not witness it.  All's well that ends well.  Lassiter rejected an offer from Ben to stay and rode off into the sunset looking for other killers who had participated in his father's wrongful hanging.
