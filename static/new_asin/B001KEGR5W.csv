3664062,4,B001KEGR5W,A 'John Carpenter's The Thing' rip off of sorts. A scifi/horror tv movie directed by Sean S. Cunningham (Friday the 13th) and starring Bruce Campbell. Campbell plays a convicted murderer being transported by law enforcement when they are stranded at an isolated airport with several other travellers. Some of which are aliens. Bruce elevates this one and Cunningham doesn't do a bad job in the director's chair(especially for a tv movie).,1287705600,,438,5.183098591549296

3664065,3,B001KEGR5W,"With any flick that's made for the Sci-Fi Channel, you pretty much know what you're going to get.  Terminal Invasion would typically fall under this category, except for the fact that it stars Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell, and he alone makes this worth watching.  Campbell stars as a death-row convict who, along with a small group of people, are stranded as a nasty blizzard rolls in.  Things go from bad to worse however when it is revealed that there are aliens in disguise among the group, and it isn't long before they all start wondering who's who and the body count starts to mount.  As said before, Terminal Invasion would fall under the usual kind of Sci-Fi Channel drek, but Campbell manages to save it, regardless of the budget limitations and sloppy direction from original Friday the 13th helmer Sean S. Cunningham.  All in all, Terminal Invasion is really only worth seeing if you're a Bruce Campbell fan, and you all know who are.  Also featuring Star Trek: Deep Space Nine vet Chase Masterson and Daily Show correspondant Jason Jones.",1235088000,15,1048,4.794444444444444
3664066,5,B001KEGR5W,"TERMINAL INVASION

How lucky was I that on the same day Bruce Campbell's ""My Name is Bruce"" came out that the long awaited DVD release of the Sci-Fi channel classic ""Terminal Invasion"" also starring Bruce came out. I have had this movie recorded on vhs for ever, since it debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel years ago. So of course we watched this movie as part of our marathon that ended with ""My Name is Bruce"", this one right before it since I bought them at the same time. Now I must say that this is a classic with out a doubt but I mean that in the sense that it is a classic for the Sci-Fi Channel, think about it this film had a low budget and also was restrained by being a TV movie. So with that said for a TV movie this is by far a classic in my mind

Deep in the mountains a car is pushing threw a snow storm trying to reach its destination in time, the reason is they are carrying a convict [Campbell] and transporting him to another prison. While driving they crash into a tree and are forced to find shelter else where, the find a small airport full of people who are stuck waiting for the storm to pass. Naturally they are not happy that they are in the company of a convicted murderer, still they must deal with it. Once everything is set up we meet a preacher who talks with the cops and prisoner in the bathroom but all is not what it seems, turns out the preacher is a creature [that rhymes] from another planet. Of course after he kills the guards are reluctant hero [Campbell] kills the alien, naturally all the people there swear he killed them as there is no trace of the preacher [they disintegrate after they die]. So from here the movie goes into a kind of who is who type film since no one knows who else could be an alien, of course that is after the witness them for them selves. So they all must survive the night and each other in order to make it out alive, if they can trust each other.

I love the story behind this film it really is an entertaining plot and keeps you guessing as well as to who is who. Writers Lewis Abernathy, John Jarrell, and Robinson Young should be credited for their story line because it really is quite good. Sure the dialogue could use some work and some of the characters seem flat, but hey this is a Sci-Fi Channel made for TV movie. Also director Sean S. Cunningham who is famous for the original Friday The 13th movie does a good job with this movie and keeps things moving nicely and keeps you guessing on who's who. I can't say enough good things about this movie since I enjoyed so much, sure it is low budget but it is what it is. Sure at times the film doesn't make sense, but I won't give things away. Still this is an enjoyable movie that even with its flaws makes for a good time.

Bruce Campbell of course does a great job as Jack the convict who must rise up to help them make it through the night. He gives another great performance on another low budget flick that honestly may not have been as good with out him, ok it would not have been. Kedar Brown also turns in a good performance as Darian and that is all I can say on him, can't ruin it. C. David Johnson does a good job as well as does most of the other cast but to be honest some of them need to go back to class, hate to say that but it is true. Most of the cast turn in believable performances but the ones who do not know how to make the flat characters come to life struggle. With that said it is still a fun movie that actually is not easy to predict as far as whom are aliens, and that is true.

Over all I really believe that for this type of film this is a classic in that realm, and you should buy it. The DVD comes with a wonderful commentary from director Sean S. Cunningham and executive producer Chuck Simon, both speak not only of the film and the actors but also what everyday people can do now a days to get into the business and learn. This was a wonderful film and a classic Sci-Fi flick, come one and all and purchase this film.",1235001600,29,3978,4.114543114543115
3664067,4,B001KEGR5W,"Bruce has done a number of B Science Fiction movies, and this is one of the better ones. You will have fun with all his B movies but this one stands out a little more because of a good story, great cast, and expert directing. Production values are excellent and help the movie feel real. You will feel you're at the airport with the rest the passengers waiting to board a small plane. Bruce is a prisoner that we know has murdered someone, but not the circumstances. He is being transported from jail to another location when they wreck in a snowstorm. They end up at the airport along with a bunch of stranded people wanting to fly out. The heavy snow isn't the worst of their worries, an alien taking human form is killing people. Problem is poor Bruce gets blamed for it. My rating is closer to three and a half stars, but for Bruce I round up. If you like some comedy with your SciFi, you will probably enjoy it. If you're a Bruce Campbell fan, you'll love it. I think this one fits into the Bruce Cult category. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Bubba Ho-Tep"". This dropped dramatically in price by at least ten dollars. I highly recommend you grab this one whether you are Bruce Campbell fan or you just enjoy a good B SciFi.

3664069,4,B001KEGR5W,"While transporting Bruce (a criminal named Jack), the cops have a car accident near a small airport. They bring Jack in to the place where clients are arguing with the owner of the charter deal and pilot  because she refuses to take off because the weather sucks, and communications are out because of the weather.

Jack asks to go to the bathroom, where a preacher attacks and kills the guards. Then, Jack kills him, then his body vanishes. Jack returns to the lobby and when the security guard holds him, he accidentally shoots a passenger, but the woman does not die until Jack shoots her in the head and her body also disappears. The other people in the terminal conclude that they are trapped in a place with aliens and it sucks to be them

A great movie for Bruce Campbell fans, not sure everyone in general will like it. I really liked it and have been waiting for it to come out on DVD.",1234224000,2,894,4.406060606060606
3664070,5,B001KEGR5W,"I just finished watching this movie and I was impressed.  First off you have Bruce throughout the whole movie as the hero, secondly you have aliens trying to take over the world, and lastly you have the women flocking to Bruce... what could be more natural, awesome and perfect for a movie.  I don't know why a movie of this caliber is so hard to find, and find in the correct DVD region, this gem should be mass-produced and be on the shelves of any Bruce Campbell fan!",1183161600,7,470,4.329545454545454

3664077,3,B001KEGR5W,"I was perusing the DVD listings one dark and stormy night,many a moon ago,and came across Terminal Invasion,which I vowed to someday own to re-watch. If my memory serves,this was the Sci-Fi Channels very first offering. I also recall this being a low budget quickie(under two months to make),made up in good old Toronto,Ontario(my old stomping grounds).The producers refer to its location as an old WW2 hangar,just outside of Toronto. Everyone who knows Toronto will tell you they filmed it at the old Downsview Airport,in northwest Toronto. They got B-movie king Bruce Campbell for the lead(practically Canadian himself as he was born just across the St Clair river in Royal Oak,Michigan),Chase Masterson(just a few years out of her starring role in Deep Space Nine as Leeta,ROM's girlfriend)and the rest of the cast of assorted Canadian talent. Is this a classic? Let's see.
The film starts off as Bruce,a convicted murderer,is being transported by a couple of correctional officers to another facility,during a nasty blizzard. They accidentally skid off the road and end up walking to a nearby airport. Landlines,cellphones and radio transmissions are all out. Bruce and the two officers hold up temporarily in the cafeteria washroom. There are at least a half dozen more people in the cafeteria itself,including two children. While Bruce and the boys wait in the washroom,a man of the cloth appears out of one of the stalls and startles the officers,who draw guns(we had seen him ask and enter the washroom earlier in the film).Campbell is handcuffed to some corner pipes and realizes,when the man asks him if he wants to confess his crimes,he is not a Catholic priest,as he wears no collar. The man sidesteps the issue and says he is just a Preacher. Campbell disagrees and before anyone knows it one of the guards has been downed by the stranger and killed,and the other soon follows. Campbell in the meantime has freed himself,has gotten a gun and fires as the stranger approaches. Nothing stops him until a well placed shot to the head finally downs the man. As he lays on the floor,he suddenly dissolves away. This is obviously no ordinary man.
Campbell soon joins the other people in the cafeteria who think,as they heard gunshots and as he is the only one to emerge out of the washroom,he has killed the officers. Campbell doesn't confirm nor deny what they are thinking. Instead he concentrates on getting himself the heck out of there,pronto. The owner of the airport,Chase,says there is no way in Hades she is going to fly Bruce anywhere in that blizzard. Suddenly a security guard tackles Bruce and they take to the floor. The gun goes off which hits a female patron. She goes down,but not for the count. She also starts to turn and kills a soldier standing beside her before she is taken down,and dissolves away.
Everyone from now on is in panic mode,as no one knows for sure if the person next to them might be an alien of some sort or not. The next person to turn is an elderly assistant to Chase,who is revealed to be one when she goes through an X-ray luggage scanner,and who kills the security guard. The number of people slowly dwindle down until there are just two standing tall at the end of the film. They end up both flying off to Canada and freedom,for one of them.
The film has some interesting twists in it here and there;the children element being just one. There is also a bit of humour thrown in such as when the security guards detached hand appears outside the scanner on the conveyor belt,near a sign that says to keep hands away from the belt. Bruce and Chase do nice work in their respective roles,in fact everyone I think did a good job in their respective roles. The direction is admirable and for a low budget film it does have some decent production values. The script however it pretty pedestrian and is the stuff B-movie dreams are made of. One line goes""I know we're all scared,so am I"".I know I may be picky here but grammatically it doesn't make sense. If we're all scared,that includes me,so it is redundant to add the ""so am I"" bit. More importantly,the writer,Lewis Abernathy,must have watched the original Twilight Zone ALOT,because if you have ever watched the ep entitled""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?"",then you will pretty much get the core of this film from that,and the rest is just added window dressing to expand it to about 90 minutes.
Technically speaking the film is in its' w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a make up test for the alien and some commentary.
All in all a decent B-movie that exemplifies the Campbell-meisters muse and career. He does a good job,along with his co star Chase Masterson and both are supported nicely by the rest of the Canadian cast. Is this a Sci-Fi classic? It IS a B-movie when all is said and done(made for TV too)but only a fair to middling picture. Not good,not bad but hardly a classic in any sense. Recommendation?.....*shrugs shoulders*...I'll leave that to you.",1346889600,,4997,4.758064516129032
3664078,4,B001KEGR5W,"Hey I just got it, the title I mean. The movie Terminal Invasion takes place in an airport ""terminal"", man I'm slow I thought it was like terminated. No wonder I watch these kind of movies, there's no thinking involved and yet it blew right by me anyway. Must be something I did back in the 70's.
 But I digest, so instead of giving you the play by play rundown on the movie like everyone else that either liked or disliked it let's get to the real subject matter, Bruce Campbell. So unless you've just arrived from a distant planet and I do mean distant to never have heard of Bruce, you pretty well know what to expect. Right?
 Anyone else attempting to star in these kind of cheap low budget predictable movies with the sorry special effects and bad scripts would be wasting their time and the $47 dollars along with a coupon for half off a buffet dinner it took to make the flick. But you put in Bruce and he'll save your movie every time or at least break even, I would guess.
 I would say,""to make a long story short,"" but that ship has sailed so I'll just say it's Bruce Campbell and I like his style.
 Hey Bruce if you're reading this I've got an idea for another sequel to the EVIL DEAD series. Give me a call and we'll do lunch. Love ya baby, Later.

3664079,4,B001KEGR5W,Campbell plays slightly off type here as a criminal who gets thrown into an Alien Invasion plot. Surprisingly good for a low budget Sci-Fi channel movie.

8314611,5,B001KEGR5W,"Okay, so it's a B movie. So it's the first of the movies made for Sci-Fi channel back when it was spelled the way I like it. So my disk had a scratch.  :-(  I still like this movie! I liked it when I first saw it on tv, remembered it for the longest time, finally had to research to find it.  A convict is being transported when the car carrying him crashes in a snow storm and the officers and the prisoner Jack (Bruce Campbell) take refuge in an out of the way airport in Alaska. Jack is handcuffed in the men's room when a man, one of the other stranded guests, comes in. Jack watches helplessly as the person now revealed as an alien begins killing people.

And that's all I will tell or I'll spoil it. No spoilers here. If you like the old movies with aliens hidden as humans, this is a fun one. When you watch the directors' commentary on the disk, and I strongly recommend you do, there's lots of good stuff there, you will find out how they worked to use the little time and budget they had to make a rather fun movie.
