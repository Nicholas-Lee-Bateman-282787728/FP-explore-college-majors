8682931,5,B00OABKR80,"This documentary takes the tale of a couple facing the imminent death of the other.  Psychiatrist Clark prepares for his `green burial' with Jane and family.  The film touts itself mainly as a film about `green burial' being an alternative to modern conventional burials, involving toxic embalming , concrete, plastics, non-biodegradable vaults and the like.  But the story pulls you into Clark and Jane's personal lives.  The family burial ceremony in a simple coffin and shroud is reminiscent of the 1800's where ceremonies were simple and the family members each took a very personal part.

Highly unconventional (today), this process then shows how `green burial cemeteries' are developing quickly across the country in wooded areas, where a plain wooden coffin is buried amongst the trees in a very natural setting with only a stone marker as a tombstone.  It's real, human and ultimately sobering.  It is an entirely new way of thinking about death and burial.  DVD supplied for review purposes.",1419379200,12,1001,5.173913043478261
8682932,5,B00OABKR80,"This touching film follows Clark Wang through his last months of life. The intimacy which you feel and profound connectedness to Clark, his family and friends is unlike anything Ive experienced in watching a documentary. The larger topic about green burial is woven seamlessly into the movie as you get a glimpse at the conversations, options and feelings one might experience as they prepare to leave this earth. This doc tugs at the heart, but in the end, I felt more at peace with subject matter thats often difficult to talk about (at least for me).

This movie is great for group discussion afterwards and has me excited for its wider release so I can share with friends (and re-watch, too)!",1419206400,6,696,4.75206611570248
8682933,5,B00OABKR80,"A locally made but nationally recognized documentary and true story about a Durham psychiatrists journey in death, dying, and green burial and the challenges of society to make that happen. A very emotional thought provoking movie guaranteed to tug at your heart whether a believer or not.",1418774400,5,289,5.170212765957447
8682934,5,B00OABKR80,"This documentary had the ability to simultaneously educate and touch the viewer's heart. The main character, who also tells the story through his emotional experience, will remain in your head for weeks with his wit and matter-of-fact approach to the end of his life.  The concept revealed in the story will inspire all who watch to consider alternatives to the traditional ways we deal with our dead.  A beautiful film for the eyes and the soul!",1415750400,7,446,4.855263157894737
