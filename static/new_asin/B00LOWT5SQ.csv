8667494,5,B00LOWT5SQ,He is so hilarious. Love it!,1509926400,,28,3.8333333333333335
8667495,5,B00LOWT5SQ,"We loved watching this show.  It was something our whole family actually enjoyed watching, as opposed to someone just tolerating in the name of family time.  Interesting subjects and people, and David Rees' is so funny.  He's goofy and awkward and brings life to these dry topics.  He interviews interesting people and there seems to be a diverse group of experts.",1461456000,,364,4.918032786885246
8667496,5,B00LOWT5SQ,"David is entertaining and engaging...and presents the everyday with intrigue and a dynamic personality. My whole family loves it, and we genuinely learn a great deal while watching. Bravo, David! Excited for season 2.",1448668800,,217,5.411764705882353
8667497,5,B00LOWT5SQ,David Rees explores apparently simple subjects and delves into them with his wonderful sense of humor. Learning and laughing at the same time; what could be better? We're looking forward to season 2 on Esquire!,1442707200,2,210,5.0285714285714285
8667498,5,B00LOWT5SQ,"We use it for STEM class and Project Based Learning training to show how to go deep into a question. Students don't realize that everything we do, use, etc., is related to all subjects; math, science, writing, reading, art.... It would also make a great jumping off point for a research and writing project or an in depth research on ""Where's the math?"" for any topic a kid could come up with. Is it geared toward the middle school mind? Sure! But as an adult, I loved it (because, really, you don't have to be so serious all of the time...and Reese IS a comedian), and my partner and I looked forward to each episode when it was airing on Nat Geo. I bought a copy for myself and am now buying a copy for one of the science teachers because he wants to borrow it all year...again!",1440460800,3,780,4.277027027027027
8667499,2,B00LOWT5SQ,"The concept is good--investigate simple activities from a variety of angles by visiting experts. How to open a door? Talk to a robotics expert, a firefighter, a lock picker, and a drummer. But Rees does not use his time with these experts wisely. He's much too busy being silly. Rather than find out how the robot works, he makes jokes about how it looks like a male stripper with its bowtie. He sings silly songs. Perhaps some people find him funny. 12 year old boys? Perhaps not.",1436832000,,481,4.540229885057471
8667500,5,B00LOWT5SQ,"Fun way to learn things, Like this program a lot! It's funny and really interesting. Going through the most simple things...",1429747200,,124,4.9523809523809526
