7725995,5,B01DX72HPM,"Love Finds You in Valentine is worth MORE than the original high price.  Many interesting subplots. The developing relationship between Kennedy & Derek is central. The actors were unknown to me, but their chemistry develops from intriguing, rocky beginning through some bumps to a satisfying conclusion. Some great dialog. Beautiful scenery. There is some faith & love of neighbor true of Christians around the world. I waited months to see it. Worth the wait. Watched 6 times so far.",1466380800,8,484,5.1265822784810124
