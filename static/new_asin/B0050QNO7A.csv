8451711,4,B0050QNO7A,"I LOVE this series and this is the only natively English DVD I can find. I received this as a gift for Christmas. It should be noted that you get THREE episodes! :D The Ultimate Guide to Dolphins, Whales, and Octopi. The Dolphins and Octopi episodes do not feature The Ultimate Guide's intro, but are actually from the Wild Discovery edits and feature that intro (the one with the tiger) as well as blackouts for commercials. The Whale episode is the original Ultimate Guide edit with original intro.

The segments on evolution will be a bit dated as the films were made between 20 and 15 years ago, most notably the evolution of cetaceans from mesonychids, rather than from artiodactyls as science would now say, but these are rather minor details on a beautiful documentary series.

The biggest issue with this DVD is that it's widescreen WITHIN fullscreen; I've added an image to show what I mean. It is fullscreen and video signal fills from the top to the bottom of the screen, but they've added artificial emptiness above and below the video to maintain widescreen aspect ration on fullscreen televisions (which I think as a society we've moved past).
Otherwise, the content is wonderful and the bonus episodes were a pleasant surprise.",1451001600,,1242,4.826291079812207

8451715,5,B0050QNO7A,My husband picked this out for his sister...She e~mailed recently that she totally loves it...she has been fortunate enough to have swum with the dolphins and knows her stuff...I'd suggest it for any dolphin lover or if you just want to expose youngsters to one of the wonderful creatures in our oceans...,1389657600,,305,4.884615384615385
8451716,4,B0050QNO7A,my 5 year old loved this dvd.  she is super curious about everything dolphin and had all the facts internalized by her second viewing.,1383177600,,134,4.583333333333333
8451717,3,B0050QNO7A,"Pretty good movie DVD, too much talk about how they ""evolved"" from wolves, though.  that part was too weird.  I was hoping for the video to be ALL about Dolphins.  Don't be fooled by the ""time"" of the DVD.  It is only 1/2 hour.  then whales 1/2 hour, then creatures in the sea 1/2 hr.",1365897600,4,284,4.090909090909091
8451718,5,B0050QNO7A,"Almost 13 grandson loves all things Dolphin. This amazing documentary taught us things even we hadn't known before.
The bonus of ""whales"" and ""Octopi"" were also interesting and informative.

I think he will watch it many times.",1357948800,3,227,5.135135135135135
