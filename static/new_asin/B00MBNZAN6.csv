Because they do not list what episodes are on the dvd, I am listing them for anyone who might like this information: There are four episodes: 1. ""The Archbishop and Chico (1956), 2. ""Grandpa Changes the World (1956), 3. Pit-A-Pit and the Dragon"" (1957), 4. The Intruder (1957)",1447718400,4,388,4.720588235294118
