4858324,4,B005QE9G5K,"Once again I am impressed with the horror movies that are being made in the far east.  This Korean offering has many of the hallmarks expected in a ""found footage"" film and are very well done.

The scenery was an intelligent choice considering most movies of this genre have one glaring fault.  The abandoned sites where ghostly happenings occur are usually too clean unless it's convenient to trip up one of the characters which leads to their ultimate demise.  In THE HAUNTED HOUSE PROJECT the abandoned buildings look as they should; old, dilapidated, and littered with junk.  Some might find if annoying that people keep falling over random objects but I feel that it lends a kind of realism to the overall project.  Try walking through an abandoned anything in real life and there's a good chance you'll tumble at least once.

While the movie takes place at night there are times where the film is a little too dark for my liking.  However, in retrospect, the lack of night-vision and sporadic illumination really helped with the overall atmosphere.  The lack of a consistent soundtrack amplified every noise heard during the movie.  I had to question if something was about to jump out or if one of the characters simply stepped on something.  It really kept you guessing what was going to happen next.

This film was a slow burner like most Asian ghost stories.  Instead of a blatant haunting the supernatural occurrences built toward a pretty harrowing climax.  The special effects were well chosen and effective.  My range of reactions to the ""jump scares"" went from mildly scared to genuinely unnerved to ""OH HOLY F***!""  I did have to subtract one star for the death scenes.  While one particular scene dropped my jaw in execution the big reveal of a dead character felt a little underwhelming.  Just my personal opinion.

I gave this film four stars because I feel it deserves that rating.  It reminded me more of NOROI ( a fantastic Japanese found footage horror movie.  If you haven't seen it then you need to find it.) than some of the American equivalents.  If you don't like subtitles or foreign films then this is not for you.  If you appreciate Asian horror and don't mind reading then I highly recommend THE HAUNTED HOUSE PROJECT.",1406332800,7,2250,4.772020725388601
4858325,2,B005QE9G5K,"The Haunted House Project follows three members of an abandoned house exploring club and a documentary crew of three as they explore a deserted haunted house that is home to several accidental deaths, unsolved murders, and missing persons reports. The Haunted House Project has a creepy setting and some disturbing imagery, but it's mostly uneventful.

The story in this film is very basic, but the storytelling was a bit sloppy. This is a found-footage film, but it does start off with a documentary like segment with brief interviews and a quick look at the settings and locals; this is a segment I really enjoyed. The rest of the film follows the same found-footage formula we've seen over and over. The film has some tense scenes but they rarely lead to anything scary or disturbing and they last too long so they lose their effectiveness. If you're looking for jump-scares, this film has very, very few excluding the very, very cheap jump-scare at the end; while I'm at it, the final sequence has some legitimate tension, but also follows a very generic path. There some imagery I found creepy, like the moving figures and the piercing, glowing eyes in the dark. Other than that, the film is pretty much uneventful. There's not much to discuss because barely anything happens in the film. The acting was good; although I liked the music, I felt it hurt the film's potential authenticity.

I purchased the DVD of this film. This DVD works on Region 1 DVD players and Region A Blu-Ray players (what I used). The DVD has English subtitles, they're not perfect but they get the message across. This does not have an English dub. This DVD does not have any special features.

Overall, The Haunted House Project has a few solid moments, but ultimately lacks the execution and innovation to create a truly scary film. Being a big fan of South Korean cinema, I was disappointed. I recommend a rental for fans of South Korean films and the horror/found-footage genres; otherwise, avoid or wait for a price drop.

This film has some blood and violence, no sex or nudity.",1364601600,,2065,4.775910364145658

8483296,3,B005QE9G5K,"This movie was pretty good.  It was suspenseful and atmospheric.  There are subtitles and there were some weak spots that left this viewer a little confused at times.  However, the beginning seemed ultra realistic with the interviews of the various residents of the village who told their stories centering around the crime and the subsequent haunting. All in all I gave it a three and did not regret seeing it.",1436832000,,411,4.8428571428571425

It has a lot of suspense and there is just enough light for you to only see what's in front of you and you have no idea what's in the darkness surrounding you. If you like this kind of movie, you should enjoy it.",1425427200,,339,3.985294117647059
