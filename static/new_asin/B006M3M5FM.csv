5003732,1,B006M3M5FM,"To start the transfer quality is about zero. It is exactly what it say on cover-celebrity skin and as such the maximum you see are tits and smiles. My guess is woman's smile is why we pay  anything otherwise why everything falling apart after in a while? Other problem the producer tells us and shows us their happy family lives after they hit 60th and its  not what I wanna know or see. Generally the DVD is suitable for guys under 15 and visible political correctness just turn me off. Off, and out of my life! Another 20 bucks wasted!",1350086400,12,537,4.36
5003733,4,B006M3M5FM,"I watched this DVD at my buddy's house and OMG was it great!
If you love seeing hot actresses naked and find yourself fast forwarding through movies to get to the ""good parts"" like I do, then I recommend Celebrity Skin.......because with this DVD you can get straight to those ""good parts"" without having to sit through the whole movie.
It's just like ""Mr. Skin"", only better and cheaper, because they put all the hottest nude scenes together one DVD so you don't need to search and download them one by one, which can get expensive.
Another great thing about this....thanks to Celebrity Skin I have discovered actresses who I never imagined had hot steamy nude scenes in their films, such as Helen Mirren (what a hot babe in those days), Michelle Pfeiffer, Candice Bergen, and Uma Thurman.
With this DVD you can discover some of the most beautiful and sexiest women ever to have graced the screen.
By the way, its almost 4 hours long, so the price is very reasonable.",1345680000,23,968,4.633720930232558

5003780,3,B006M3M5FM,"It's pretty good for what it is - a thorough treatment of celebrity sex scenes in movies from the 1970s and primarily 1980s, with a sultry female voice-over to introduce each actress with some still shots and a bit of what they are doing now (2011).  However, if 'now' is 2011, the video quality of this compilation should have been much better overall.  I can appreciate that much of this footage is out of print and VHS is all they had, but I have DVDs of some of the movies featured in this, and they look FAR better.  It appears that all of this footage is from VHS and mostly in 4:3 aspect as well (though they did show several scenes in wide screen and occasionally even letterboxed so we can see the entire width).  Some of the scenes really suffer in quality beyond a VHS-to-DVD transfer, and appear very grainy.  I do wonder, could they have put the full 3 hours and 45 minutes of running time on a single disc if it had been full DVD quality where available; perhaps not.

The other slight disappointment here is that despite an ""unrated"" compilation, all of the scenes you see are from the R-rated versions of the films.  It's pretty obvious that you can't include graphic footage as in Helen Mirren's appearance in Caligula (in which there are intercut scenes of fully explicit girl-on-girl in the other room), but even the shower scene from Dressed To Kill is the much more brief version (again, I have the uncut Blu-ray and believe me, there's a lot you don't see in the R-rated version).  Naturally the degree of exposure throughout is also lessened by the video quality since, again, it's mostly pretty grainy which obscures what you can really see.  Many furry full frontal shots become one big black blur.

But the really great thing about this DVD (apart from its price having come down to 7 bucks with Prime delivery) is that you do get a broad look at a lot of supposedly ""notorious"" or ""controversial"" scenes from 70s and 80s movies so you can see for yourself what all the fuss was about and especially decide whether to get your own copy of those movies.  I saw how racy but not racy the scene in Postman Always Rings Twice was (some interesting crotch fondling but zero nudity), or how much fur and more you get to see in the shower scene in Chained Heat.  Or I can continue to pine for a fully HD *and uncensored* version of Private Lessons so maybe we can finally see the full quality they captured on film.",1421625600,5,2434,4.469525959367946

5003787,5,B006M3M5FM,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this documentary.  Some of the film clips used clearly suffered from poor original production values but they were surprisingly clear for the most part.  Totally unexpected was the pleasant-voiced narrator introducing each clip with a thumbnail bio of the celebrity in question, including in many cases a 'what she's doing now' bit (""now"" being 2011, of course).  On my first three-hour forty-four-minute viewing I found no end of delights and while I take exception to some of the clips shown, such at using Kim Basinger's poorly lit dark-stairway scene from 9 1/2 Weeks  rather than, for example the two scenes she does with her then husband Alec Baldwin in the remake of Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway, I realize there are probably ownership issues with some movies; and I can't really fault the producers on that score.  I do have one little glitch to point out, not enough to cost this documentary a star in my book, though.  The final clip focuses on Nancy Travis and purports to use a scene from the 1990 Internal Affairs to demonstrate her willingness to disrobe.  Sorry folks, but the scene shown has Richard Gere being ridden cowgirl style by Faye Grant as Penny Stretch, not Nancy Travis as Kathleen Avila.  The closest Travis comes to 'showing some skin' in this movie are the black-and-white flashes that come out of Raymond Avila's (Andy Garcia) drunken imaginings of his wife screwing Gere--who does seem to find his way into every pair of panties on the set, Travis and Laurie Metcalf the clear exceptions.  And the only frames in those flashes that could possibly qualify are the two or three that show Gere clutching either a breast or a bra.  But as I say, given the overall quality of this documentary I have to say thanks!",1418083200,5,1785,4.785016286644951

5003823,5,B006M3M5FM,"This compilation of the 'good parts' from dozens of 70's and 80's vintage mainstream movies presents a satisfying cavalcade of major actresses (American and European) revealing their bodies in steamy sequences lifted from their films.  The background info is provided by a female narrator's voice and a bit of a filmography is given for each actress's career prior to showing a clip or two from flix where they 'bared all' for the sake of their art.  The skin scene is then followed by an interesting follow-up photo and blurb as to 'what' the actress is currently doing with their life.

The visual quality of the sequences from the various films depicted is somewhat variable but most are good and presented in whatever 'screen ratio' format the original picture was presented in.  The women are , of course, gorgeous & naked throughout. From a strictly economic standpoint this is a tremendous value as it would cost hundreds of dollars to assemble all of the full length movies that the clips were taken from.  For what it is - this is a well produced and presented package and a fun watch - highly recommended!",1401235200,3,1115,4.786458333333333
5003824,5,B006M3M5FM,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Celebrity Skins as it is a very classy group of documentaries that retrospectively depicts nudity and sex in cinema.  The DVD's total over three hours in length and include approximately two decades of film footage from the seventies and eighties.  The women are beautiful actors from both Europe and North America and the  narration  is interesting and educational as it touches on personal and career highlights of each actress.

My favorite parts are ""epic"" lines from certain film clips such as Candace Bergen's  the 1978 movie  A Night Full of Rain  where she states ""I've got to get out of here.  First thing we learn is never trust Italian.  How do I know you're not some f'n  seducer ...""  as she reaches climax with Giancarlo Giannini, her co-star.  Another favorite is  from the move 10 with Bo Derrick asking ""But what's wrong with turning on and screwing to Ravel's ""Bolero?"" I'm sure this undoubtedly increased sales for Ravel's  ""Bolero"" record.

Because of  the tasteful manner in which these documentaries are made, by no means can they be considered porn despite certain clips and references. I wouldn't hesitate playing the documentary in the background at parties  -  which should  please those guests that have trouble mingling and inevitably migrate to the living room couch.

I highly recommend this documentary to all and particularly to those movie buffs in any genre.",1400803200,3,1422,5.017167381974249
5003825,1,B006M3M5FM,"Very disappointed in this one. This one is nothing but a history of actresses from the 1960's to 1989 that did a few semi nude &/or nude scenes in movies. It has short video clips of the nude scenes but they are of very poor quality. Most of them are so fuzzy they look like they were taken from old VHS tapes that came from a video store after they had been played so many times they were worn out. It looks like they were trying to do a history of sex scenes in movies but they did a very poor job of it. If the scenes they showed were good quality instead of looking like they were shot with a cell phone with a dirty lens by an alcoholic jonesing for a drink, then it might have been worth watching.

5003827,5,B006M3M5FM,I bought Celebrity Skin as a special 50th birthday present for my husband.  What caught my eye about this documentary was the fact that the movie centers in on his two favorite decades the 1970's and 1980's.  We are both movie buffs.  When he opened the gift his eyes lit up after reading the film featured 90 classic nude scenes with his favorite movie stars.  I was surprised that the DVD was three hours long and full of informative information for only 8.99!  The movie is very tasteful and well done.  The quality of Celebrity Skin film is vibrant in color with upbeat music for each sound track and I really liked the narrator's voice.  We tried to remember the original movies as we viewed the film clips.  It turned out to be a great conversation piece between the two of us.  As we continued to watch the movie it was fun to see Demi Moore years younger and my husband's favorite part was seeing Farrah Fawcett in the documentary while Farrah's famous posters are always imbedded in one's mind.  The film was full of famous movie stars.  It was interesting learning about their careers and background before stardom. We couldn't keep track but this film included over 40 stars. I definitely recommend the purchase.,1400544000,6,1223,4.641860465116279
5003828,3,B006M3M5FM,"The producers try to lend an air of legitimacy to this DVD by having a female voice-over give a prologue and brief review of each starlet's career, which is a waste of time in my opinion.  No one buying this DVD is doing so for ""research"" for a college sociology class.  You want to see famous people naked.  End of story.

All featured celebrities are female film actors.  One chapter covers all of the 70's decade.  Then each year of the 80's is given its own chapter.  There is no footage newer than 1989, so this collection will appeal to the slightly older male.  But it makes pausing a whole lot easier than that VHS copy you wore out years ago.

My 2 complaints:

1.  Organizing the chapters by year is stupid.  Most of the featured ladies had careers that spanned a decade or more.  No one thinks to themselves, ""I wonder who appeared nude in 1987?""  They think, ""I wonder what films Jane Doe appeared nude in.""  They should have simply listed all the ladies alphabetically, & allowed you to navigate through the list (you can't).

2.  No recent material from the 90's, 00's & beyond.  Where's the sequel?",1400457600,,1113,4.48

5003835,2,B006M3M5FM,"Both pros & cons on this one.

PROS:
It's long.
Lots of female nudity.
Well done documentary as the MC lets you know what movie(s) the person has been in, who they married, and where they are now.

CONS:
Did I say LONG? It IS that, but most of it is because they show you long scenes from most movies. Even scenes without any nudity in them.
No chapters (there ARE some ""scene selections based on years"" but it still makes it extremely difficult to find a particular person)
A LOT of obscure, foreign, artists (granted they LOOK nice, but who wants to listen to an entire scene in some foreign language without captions?).
Filmed entirely with 2.0 sound (even though I'm sure many of these films came out with a 5.1 soundtrack on them.

It's not even the kind of movie you would play for your friends. Overall, it's just plain boring.

The history was interesting especially about the ones that left acting and went into other fields which almost always dealt with animal rights, clothing, or art.
The nude scenes varied from in a few cases complete nudity for extended periods all the way to side quick flashes. Most of the skin scenes were just generally in passing.

5003850,3,B006M3M5FM,"I like documentary films that cover risque topics.  I think this might have been better had there been a little more information to go with the clips.  I would also have been nice if the filmmakers had access to better source material to take their clips from.  And most importantly it might have been better if they had done their research a little more thoroughly.

Firstly the most glaring mistake is the final clip from Internal Affairs (1990).  The segment is about the absolutely beautiful Nancy Travis, but the clip they show and claim is Travis is actually actress Faye Grant.  There are also other little mistakes.  I don't recall which actress they were covering, but I think it was Simone Griffeth.  For some reason there is a random head shot of actress Jacqueline Lovell thrown in while they are giving Griffeth's background.  It was these types of mistakes and not having more information that explore the topic that kept me from giving this more stars.  I commend the filmmakers for trying to make this somewhat of a documentary instead of just throwing the clips out there, but they could have done so much more to make it better.

I loved the way every scene was preceded by a short bio introduction of the actors and additional background information about the movie the scene was from. As the documentary covers a wide range of movies, these short introductions made every scene more interesting and fun to watch.
It was an eye-opener to discover how seductive and feminine the actresses from those days were and i love how the scenes are acted in such a natural and convincing way. Although the documentary is nearly three hours long, I couldn't get enough of it. It sparked a flame inside me for watching more old movies from now on.

it had a very brief aspect of the 70's. and mainly concentrated on the 80's in general. the bios were extremely brief and in some cases the photos that accompanied them were better than the scenes themselves. Morgan Fairchild is a good example for this as well as the dark scenes. Her scene was from The Seduction but not from the bathroom scene. They put in the famous Phoebe Cates scene from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. in here as well as Sylvia Kristel's scene from Private Lesson's(although she was one of the few in here who could have had a whole DVD dedicated to them.

Why? First of all it covers both the 70's decade plus the entire 80's, whereas Easy 80's only covers five years from the 80's decade. Second, this one has more ""A"" list actresses, whereas the others including Easy 80's only show obscure actresses that the producers think are ""hot"" but no one else has ever heard of. Third, this one has excellent production values, super-cool menus and graphics, and looks like it cost some serious money to put together, whereas the Easy 80's series looks like it was done by amateurs on a home computer. Fourth, this one has a narrator who is a hot sultry female in her own right, whereas Easy 80's has only text scrolling across the screen like the old silent movies used to have (I guess with their minuscule budget, they couldn't even afford to hire a narrator).

I could go on with the comparison, but I don't want to bore you. I read those one-star reviews, and I couldn't disagree more......no one is speaking Japanese in this DVD and the quality is on a par with any other DVD on the market. The product description was ""spot on"" accurate too.

Even though I really enjoyed this and think it's a good buy, I'm not giving it five stars because, at the end of the day, it's not ""Avatar"", it's just a compilation video, but a darn good one at that.
