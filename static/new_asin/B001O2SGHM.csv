8328933,3,B001O2SGHM,"This DVD is in Swedish (the Swedish title is ""Hans och Hennes"" instead of ""Making Babies""), with English subtitles. I originally purchased it to help me learn to speak and understand Swedish. I have purchased a lot of Swedish-language DVDs in recent years for this purpose.

This is a somewhat interesting story of a young unmarried couple in rural modern Sweden looking to take the plunge into both marriage and having a child. The main problem is they have great difficulty in conceiving, which leads to tension in the relationship and problems in their lives. It seems to be sort of a low-budget film, but that's ok, that sort of contributes to its charm. Interesting, and a story worth watching, but there is a problematic unspoken sub-theme to this film that first time viewers may not immediately pick up on.

If you watch this film, please just be aware that throughout it you are being subtly and sometimes not so subtly subjected to European Union propaganda via both the story line and dialogue with regard to ""multi-culturalism"" (mass immigration policies), EU rule over sovereign European nations like Sweden, and you are being conditioned to lessen any nationalistic feelings about Sweden you may carry.

Following the credits at the end of the film, the European Union flag comes up on screen with the following text (in Swedish): ""This project is partially financed by the European Union, European Regional Development Fund.""

So, watch ""Making Babies,"" yes. It is sort of interesting. But please watch it with a critical eye and with the full knowledge that you are being intentionally propagandized by the European Union. Please do not let this EU propaganda in any way modify your own thinking, feelings, or behavior. In fact, in some respects this film is worth watching specifically BECAUSE it is EU propaganda. It provides a window into the mindset of the EU politicians and intellectuals who seek to intentionally permanently deconstruct European nation states as we have known them for hundreds of years.",1345334400,,2027,5.023809523809524
