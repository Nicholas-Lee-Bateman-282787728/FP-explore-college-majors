8526555,5,B008AYK42W,"Fun, clean, engaging mystery for my 7-11 year olds. So, ok it's dated...(think 1980's clothing, music and computers :), but my 10 year old loved it. The values are positive. The script/actors are tweens/teens, so they do deal with teen-related issues (one character overcomes prejudice...one turns from stealing from his grandfather)...but I thought it was fine for older youngsters or tweens.",1412640000,,393,5.459016393442623
