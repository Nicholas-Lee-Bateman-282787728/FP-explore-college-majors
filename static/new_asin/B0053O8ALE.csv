4534118,5,B0053O8ALE,"Most of the other current/new shows are on amazon's instant video--why not person of interest. This is a great show and I have been watching re-runs on the CBS website because each time you watch and episode again, you discover something you missed the first time.  This is a great show--a smart show--one of the best new shows out there.  CBS will eventually take these episodes down--I would like to buy/download and keep them on amazon.  Waiting for the DVD could take a year perhaps.  I guess my point is others are up--why not ""Person of Interest"".",1318809600,38,553,4.670103092783505

4534160,5,B0053O8ALE,"Best season content of all the seasons. Love  Caviezel's articulation, Paige Turco is beautiful as is Carter and Shaw and love their strength. -good to see women portrayed as they should be, smart, principled, able vs old days as victims.  Emerson's variety of  abilities and overcoming personal obstacles is inspirational. Bear of course is outstanding. Would have preferred  the elimination of Decima and Samaritan and evil gray hair villain and focus on machine working on irrelevants. This had the potential of being dynamic crime fighting series with the variety of personality turns. The Violance for the most part was not gruesome as TV shows are evolving these days.  Reese's skills are well done, get the job done and creative. Background on characters would have been nice to know on how they evolved-stingy on information that might have enhanced the episodes. Congrats to actors if they did their own stunts -hard on bodies and health.  Take care.",1498262400,2,959,5.115384615384615

Most network TV shows are super predictable but this one manages to surprise me. Even the soundtrack and score is amazing. Wish I could forget everything and watch it for the first time all over again!",1497398400,2,349,5.25
4534164,3,B0053O8ALE,"Just about... I'm not a consistent fan of cop shows, though I love a noir mystery and like to read Raymond Chandler, Ross McDonald, et el., but this to me is a stylish, well-photographed hackneyed, comic book, not even nearly so good as Law and Order and far, far below the average BBC thriller of detective shows.  The premise is preposterous--again kind of Superman comic-y--appealing, perhaps, to an adolescent sensibility.  I know I gave it three (3) stars, which is more then it deserves, but I did watch it straight through so it must have something.  Not much, though. IMHO...",1496620800,,583,4.81

4534196,5,B0053O8ALE,"I hardly watch TV, but POI was the only TV drama I truly enjoyed.  Not sure why it had to end like that; they might have run out of ideas for the plot.

90%+ of TV dramas/movies rely on sex scenes but POI did not resort to that monkey-intelligence, easy-to-get-attention approach, which I liked a lot. Why do I have to be forced to watch someone else's bed scenes?",1487721600,,364,4.260869565217392

Stimulating, taut, well-written and well-acted.  Special mention to Ms. Taraji P Henderson in this pre-Empire (which I have not watched) outing.  Kudos to the players",1485129600,,363,4.73015873015873

4534246,5,B0053O8ALE,"I've only seen reruns of Person of Interest randomly on TV, and honestly I wasn't terribly into it at first due to the fact I have never seen it from the beginning. The plot is thick and well thought out, but if you don't follow it in sequence, it can be confusing. Well, once I started watching it from the first episode forward, everything made much more sense! Now I'm hooked, as I was with Burn Notice, NCIS, and so many other TV series. It can be serious and light hearted at the same time, and I like the subtle humor thrown into each storyline. Now I'm waiting to get the next season when I can  afford it.",1484438400,3,613,4.194915254237288

4534251,1,B0053O8ALE,"Perhaps I'm a spoiled from watching all five seasons of Breaking Bad, which was addicting but I have a real hard time sitting through this. Jim Caviezel is an excellent actor in his other roles in Pay It Forward, Passion of the Christ and The Thin Red Line -- but this role just doesn't fit him.

Caviezel isn't a special ops badass period. It's not the right match for him. It's simply the wrong persona. Also, the story was ho-hum and seemed like The Hunger Games -- with a couple of people having the power to the impossible. I kept thinking, ""This isn't remotely believable"". The fight scenes are poorly choreographed or stages. It was painfully obvious on a large television.",1482796800,,680,4.619834710743802

I have watch the first 2 discs and I don't find the episodes to be all that intriguing and make me sit on the edge of my seat waiting for more.  The acting is fine and it is a rather unique story line, but after you have seen the episodes from disc one, there isn't anything more to the plot - at least not that I figured out.

If you're not trained in marshal arts or have not been in a fight you can believe that getting hit with force is a simple annoyance that can be overcome with practice. Having been there I know that you can ignore pain and accomplish almost anything, however, the person(s) you're fighting must help you by being either untrained or overconfident. The other objection I had to overcome, although not as vigorously, was that someone could accurately predict what one person in sixteen plus million people could and would do in the very near future. Other than those very shaky premises, I love the show and would recommend it to everyone of my friends with a caveat, take it as entertainment, although some of it is very real.

The producers took an interesting 21st Century concept, and added intelligent scripts, brilliant actors, the backdrop of New York City, and an upbeat pace. The results were compelling drama with up-to-the minute relevancy. This is easily one of the most original shows on TV. The stellar cast of Michael Emerson, Jim Caviezel and  Taraji P. Henson and Kevin Chapman has set a new standard for network television drama. The Blu-ray brings sharp, brilliant color to beautiful New York City scenes.",1453939200,4,673,5.174311926605505

4534961,5,B0053O8ALE,"Imagine for a second that there was a show, created by Jonathan Nolan of the Dark Knight Trilogy, Produced by J.J. Abrams, and starring three Emmy award winners, and an Academy Award nominee. Do you think that show would be the number one show on television? In fact, it is, since it's 2011 debut, Person of Interest hasn't finished lower than 25th in the Nielsen Ratings and has won more awards in five years, than other shows have in twenty.

So, you're the person who hasn't seen it yet? Here's what it's about...

Reclusive billionaire, Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), has build a machine, one that sees every camera, listens to every phone call, and reads everything you post of the net. He designed the machine to fight terrorism, but the machine sees everything, including threats to every day people. The government considers these person to person crimes, irrelevant, but how can Harold? Unable to live with the foreknowledge of these crimes, Howard has put together a team of two New York City Detectives and two former CIA operatives to stop the treats against ordinary people.

When the show first started, it was purely episonic, but just like Harold's machine, the show has evolved to take on more complex and continuous story lines. Action superstar, Jim Caviezel, best known for his Academy nominated performance in The Passion stars, and he is honestly better than any other action star I've ever seen on TV. Usually these guys are big and good looking, but not very bright or talented. Caviezel is different though, as he brings together the style of James Bond, with the moves of Jackie Chan, and the wit of Sherlock Holmes, to create the ultimate crime fighter, John Reese.

Caviezel is paired with Michael Emerson, best known as Ben, the leader of the others on Lost. This guy is so mysterious and intense, that it's almost as if he was created in a lab, by J.J. Abrams, just to star in his shows.

Person of Interest gives you something different and something exciting with every episode. The writing is phenomenal, and the characters are as complex as I've ever seen in any TV show. The rumor is that this fantastic cast is getting to be too expensive, and the writers are running out of ideas. For that reason, season five has been cut to just thirteen episodes, and there is speculation that it may end after that. I really hope that is not the case, because this show is a constantly refreshing source of hours of quality entertainment. Every episode is a mystery, a twist, a flashback, and reeks of J.J. Abrams influence, for that I have to label Person of Interest as a must see TV show!",1452470400,,2616,4.703056768558952

4534966,5,B0053O8ALE,"Building in part on wide public interest in US government intrusions revealed by Edward Snowden, this series is remarkably prescient.  The technology may not be quite here yet to monitor the intentions and potential for violence of most private citizens.  But I can testify from 40 years of professional employment in and around the US intelligence community, that the impulse to do so is well represented from real life.  The moral dilemmas offered in Person of Interest are real, even if some of the scenarios might seem a bit far fetched.  They aren't as far out as you might be inclined to believe.

Buy or stream all of the seasons of this series.  It will engage you almost against your will, and keep you guessing and interested.",1450051200,,736,4.755905511811024

4535201,3,B0053O8ALE,"J.J. Abrams is one of THE guys in Hollywood right now. Johnathan Nolan is no slouch in his own right with a strong handful of movies under his belt worked with his brother Chris. So how is it these two come up with this mediocre endeavor.

Here's the scoop. Harold Finch (Michael Emerson) has devised a computer that crunches all kind of data and spits out a number (person) that will, somehow, be involved in a violent crime. As he himself is in no physical condition to thwart the crimes, he enlists the help of a one time high level operative (Jim Caviezel) who has fallen off the map due to the death of a long time girlfriend. Together they work the cases and try to stop the killing before it happens.

This is essentially ""Minority Report"" using a super computer instead of 3 ""pre-cogs."" I like the set-up. I like Emerson and Caviezal. This is some pretty cool stuff but too much of the writing is slack. And some of the gimmicks are used too many times. As in many TV series, different writes will pen the various episodes. I've seen this work well, but here the writers don't seem up to snuff. In one episode the female detective Carter, who is trying to track down our heroes, is shown in a flashback interrogating a suspected terrorist in, I think, Afghanistan. Seeing her do this, and juxtaposing it with a similar scene in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" makes this look downright lame. And what about Caviezal's Character john Reese. Here's a guy who in the opening scenes is grief stricken with a broken life. He looks like he crawled out of the bottom of a bottle. But when he signs on with Finch he's back at the top of his game in a heartbeat. No wind-up. No getting back in the groove. People can't flip a switch like that.

There are other bothersome points but why dawdle? In spite of its flaws, I DO find myself proceeding to each next episode so there must be something, way down in the psyche, that is working. So don't let me dissuade you. Check it out for yourself.",1441756800,,1978,4.413698630136986

I live in Saudi Arabia and I can hardly wait for their arrival.

It is distracting and makes me ask him, ""What is the purpose of all this whispering?"" instead of paying attention to the story.

4535569,5,B0053O8ALE,"""Person of Interest"": its as interesting as it gets !!!

It is one of the best drama series I have watched on TV for a very long time (Breaking Bad excluded though!!).

The concept of the series is very good and innovative. I love the acting of the guy who played John Reese (Jim Caviezel) and Harold Finch (Michael Emerson). The supporting cast particularly Joslyn Carter (played by Taraji P. Henson) and Lionel Fusco (played by Kevin Chapman) have also done a commendable job. My favorite though is the duo of Reese and Finch !!!!

The best thing about this is it has a new story line in every episode. And yet there is an overall story developing over the episodes. In a way, you get the best of both the worlds. The premise of getting a SSN number from ""The Machine"" and using it to save an innocent life seems to be interesting.

Another interesting thing about this series is the way they show parts of the past life of all the characters which makes sense in the bigger picture and helps the viewer understand the overall story.

I am so hooked to this drama series that I gave a pass to Game of Thrones (Season 5, Episode 5) last week to watch the second season of Person of Interest.

The only bad thing: its not free on any of the services like Amazon Instant video, Netflix, CBS etc. !!!!",1431388800,3,1299,4.369294605809128

4535660,5,B0053O8ALE,"""Person of Interest""  is a tense, taut crime/technological thriller that immediately engages and compels viewers with its highly innovative stories and superb acting from a first-rate cast that includes Michael Emerson, Jim Caviezel, Taraji P. Henson, Kevin Chapman, Amy Acker, and many others.

All 23 episodes of ""Person of Interest's"" first season very quickly established this as a series very different from every other drama on network TV. The show's main characters are Harold Finch (Emerson) and John Reese (Caviezel), two men who live in the shadows. Finch is a multi-billionaire computer designer and software developer who created a super-computer for the government; Reese is a former CIA agent and Special Forces soldier, now working for Finch as a ""fixer"" and enforcer.

Finch's super-computer, which he calls ""The Machine,"" can sift through trillions of megabytes of data and then predict terrorist crimes against the United States.  But Finch's ""machine"" not only can predict all future terrorist threats; it can also foretell every other future crime as well - felonies the government considers ""too insignificant"" to do anything about.

Finch, suffering from a severe permanent physical injury, feels honor-bound to do something to help stop those ""insignificant"" crimes before they happen. He enlists the assistance of a down-and-out, homeless, alcoholic Reese, who reluctantly agrees to be Finch's agent in the field.

Complicating matters for both Finch and Reese is the fact that Reese is being hunted by both the CIA and the FBI, who consider him a major threat to national security; and by the NYPD, who suspects him of committing a series of unsolved murders.

""Person of Interest"" is a terrific show on many levels. The acting is superb. Emerson and Caviezel maintain a quiet, reserved demeanor, a characteristic that adds tremendous credibility to each character's persona. Supporting actors, especially Taraji P. Henson who plays NYPD Detective Carter, and Kevin Chapman, who plays Detective Fusco, are equally good in their roles.

But what sets ""Person of Interest"" apart from other new shows (most of which try to bring something ""fresh"" and ""different"" to their story lines) is that this show actually does that. Each episode creates a chilling, almost paranoid atmosphere from beginning to end.

All of this adds up to a show that quietly and poses a question we all must grapple with: is vigilante justice ever an acceptable means of preventing or solving crimes? It's a question the show's creators and producers have wisely left unanswered, for even though viewers can see the positive results of Reese's and Finch's efforts, they should carefully consider the means used to achieve their desired ends.  Highly recommended.",1429401600,4,2759,5.307339449541284

4535691,5,B0053O8ALE,"I got this to show to try because it sounded great, and it turned out to be even better.  Heres a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the booklet included.

1.  Pilot:  A man named Finch recruits a former CIA agent known as Reese to help him in his mission to aid people who are either the victims or instigators of violent crimes.  Not the best pilot Ive seen, but not the worst.  My main problem is how Reese got captured a little too easily.  But nobody suffered because of it, so it was just harmless but annoying filler.  B+

2.  Ghosts:  The Machine indicates a teenage girl as a Person of Interest (POI).  However, records show that the girl is already deceased.  A bit better, but its still frustrating at times.
A-

3.  Mission Creep:  Reese follows an ex-soldier, returned home from war, and discovers he belongs to a crew of bank robbers.  Now this is more like it.  A

4.  Cura Te Ipsum:  Reese observes a woman who leads a double life; she spends her days as a doctor and her nights at a nightclub.  Not the best, but not the worst.  B

5.  Judgment:  The Machine singles out a judge who is presiding over a seemingly open-and-shut case, but the proceedings take an abrupt turn when mobsters kidnap the judges son.  Pretty good.  B+

6.  The Fix:  Reese poses as the driver for an elite corporate fixer and attempts to discern who might want to kill this beguiling woman.  This is one of the best episodes, with an interesting recurring character and an excellent story.  A+

7.  Witness:  After a mob hit in Brighton Beach, Reese rushes to protect a teacher who witnessed the assassination.  B+

8.  Foe:  A resurfaced, elusive Cold War-era spy is the Person of Interest trailed by Reese and Finch.  This episode starts off really interesting, but gets stupid when Reese is captured way too easily.  C

9.  Get Carter:  Reese and Finch have eluded detective Carters investigations so far, but will their cover be blown when she becomes a Person of Interest?  One of the best episodes.  A+

10.  Number Crunch:  Resources run thin and nerves fray when The Machine provides four numbers at once and Reeses past closes inat close range.  Another excellent episode.
A+

11.  Super:  Reese and Finch move into a building to keep an eye on the Person of Interest: its superintendent.  Meahwhile, Carter attempts to track down Finch, and a flashback reveals the early era of the Machine.  Yet another excellent episode.  A+

12. Legacy:  Reese is assigned to protect a young lawyer who advocates for prisoners no one wants to represent, and Finchs past resurfaces when the son of his former business partner comes back to town.  The excellent episodes just keep on coming.  A+

13.  Root Cause:  When an unemployed man is framed for murder, Reese and Finch try to uncover the conspiracy behind the assassination.  This show just keeps getting better.  A+

14.  Wolf and Cub:  Reese instructs a revenge-minded teen on how to take action without taking lives, and Finch continues to hide the details of his past.  Not the best episode, but not the worst either.  B

15.  Blue Code:  An undercover cop planted inside a smuggling ring is the teams POI.  Reese sends Fusco to infiltrate the NYPDs classified records.  This is a great episode.  A

16.  Risk:  Our heroes outsmart the smart money while protecting a Wall Street wiz in a case that reconnects Reese to his darkest days.  This is one of the best episodes.  A+

17. Baby Blue:  Reese turns to an unexpected source for help when he works the case of a POI who is six months old, and Carter decides that she wants out of Reese and Finchs vigilante operation.  The worst episode of the season.  I actually thought this would be the end of the series for me.  D-

18.  Identity Crisis:  Two people use the same name and Social Security number.  Which one is the POI, and which one is the fake?  This episode had an interesting premise, but it got really stupid towards the end.  C-

19.  Flesh and Blood:  Elias sets his plan in motion to kill his rival Mafiosi, putting Reese, Finch, and the NYPD in the uncomfortable situation of protecting their enemies.  This is an excellent episode that redeems the series completely.  A+

20.  Matsya Nyaya:  Reese joins a team of armored car security to discern the origin of a threat to a guard, and flashbacks show a turning point in Reeses past.  Another excellent episode.  A+

21.  Many Happy Returns:  Finch conceals the newest number from Reese, and Carter becomes the POI teams mole in a new FBI Inquiry tied to Reese.  Yet another excellent episode.  A+

22.  Dangerous knowledge: someone else may be close to finding out about the Machine, and Reese delves into Finchs past.  The excellent episodes keep on coming.  A+

23.  Fire Wall: The FBI traps Reese in a hotel while he protects a psychiatrist who has come into the sights of corrupt cops.  This is an excellent end to the season.  A+

This is a really good show.  It took a bit to get going, but after episode 8 there were only 3 episodes less than A.  The characters are great and the story is very engaging.  I don't want to spoil anything else, just check this show out ASAP.",1427846400,,5154,4.551267916207276

4535741,1,B0053O8ALE,"I wanted to like this but found it almost unwatchable.  The opening two episodes were poorly plotted, acted and directed and what should have been carefully crafted and engaging groundwork for the premise came over as a disjointed collection of predictable action sequences linked by shots of a guy whispering into his magic cellphone being fed unbelievable real time data by the stereotypical ""grey man"" controller.  To say that the characters: Grey Man, Action Man, Sexy Cop Determined To Uncover The Truth and Bad Cop Probably Going To Come Good are cardboard is to do packing material a serious injustice.

From the very start POI delivers a taught story each episode as ex- Spec Ops/CIA operator John Reese (James Caviezel) and billionaire computer genius Harold Finch (Michael Emerson) team up as our heroes.  They use information received from the post 9/11 electronic surveillance system Harold designed and built for the gov't to assist strangers identified as being at risk of harm or thwart potential evil doers.  It's a clever premise and the supporting cast is very good- the team is aided by a couple of NYC detectives and later by another ex-CIA black ops operator, a sexy ""fixer"", and a would-be cyber crook they have saved before, not to mention their adopted Belgian Malinois retired military working K9, Bear.  This is an exciting program and has a dry sense of humor with well crafted writing.

My husband is not a science fiction fan, but we both enjoy this show with its underlying Orwellian premise.  Violence consists of the ""brawn"" guy shooting or otherwise downing the bad guy's henchmen without (usually) killing them, and there is no gore. The ""brains""  guy doesn't like guns. I enjoy both of the main actors (especially Michael Emerson who plays Finch), and in season one the show slowly develops the relationships between the characters as well as their background stories. Sometimes the ""muscle"" guy is so good that I have to stifle a giggle (you know the bad guy is going to get tossed out of the window or shot in the kneecap---ouch), though after the first few episodes they seemed to try to balance this out by making him a tiny bit more vulnerable.

It has a unique plot-line, and the actors are credible.

Now I'm looking forward to the third. I was a huge fan of Lost, so I wasn't sure I would like seeing "" Ben""  in another show, but he is wonderful in this series and so is James Caviazel. Buy it.

4536557,5,B0053O8ALE,"While some  of my politics make the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter seem left wing, when it comes to due process however, my views are very left of center. The premise of the show goes against that belief. I am a big fan of Jim Claviezl and his ""Man in The Suit"" character is one of the best to appear on the small screen in a while. With additions of Sarah Shahi character ""Shaw"" and bringing Amy Acker's character ""Root"" on as regulars has brought some game to the series. I was shocked and sadden of a loss of a main character and at first I though the character would have been John Reese. Personally I feel JJ Abrahms is kind of over-rated but this is a genuine work of art.",1401494400,,686,4.157894736842105

4536561,5,B0053O8ALE,"This show came on the air before the NSA scandal, and is amazingly close - and beyond - that spying.  The show is intriquing, and in no way formulaic.  I didn't even know this show was on until halfway through the 2013 season, and like it enough to actually pay money to catch up on episodes on Amazon.  The :""catching up"" is explaining a lot.  The ""Team"" receives supposedly random SS numbers from an ultra-super-computer, and the names attached to those numbers need help in one way or another.  In other words, some of the people are in trouble, some are causing trouble.  Very interesting show.",1400544000,,598,4.59433962264151

4536563,3,B0053O8ALE,"Jim Caveilze is clumsy as the rough, quiet hero. You guys really need to work on the fight scene blocking, the pulled punches and kicks are badly done. Get a new stunt coordinator. This has potential for a good action series if you don't politicize the show. The hero's method of portraying a gruff voiced quiet man is hurting. The point of view from planted cameras doesn't track; there is only so much these things can see. I like the story plots of most episodes but some are way, way over the top. Real world has ugly people in it, these actors are all so polished the make the series unbelievable, maybe if this were a movie we could have some old and ugly people in it? I like Abrams work on the MI franchise and I liked Lost but it got so big I couldn't follow it seeing only one episode a week. The recent NSA revelations add creditability. Some characters are just too stiff and clumsy to the series. The information about the use of fractals and Pi in cryptology are interesting and pretty accurate real world tools. There are some holes in continuity but for the most part its a solid C for this series with potential for an A if the kinks are worked out.  Abrams series usually gel in the second season but kind of wallow in mediocre after the 100th show and syndication. I hope the cast and crew get everything worked out by season two and ride it into syndication and brilliant success.

I ask  myself whether it hurts his throat to talk like that all of the time.  It sounds like I'm going on too much about that, but it really distracts me sometimes.  I like Bear and the dynamic between he and his two buddies.  Interesting the way they bring Carter and the other police officer on board - in very different ways.

The premise of the show is pretty cool. Growing up in the 80s, I consider this like the A-team for the new Millenium. I really enjoy the characters; you got funny, action packed, and of course Ms. Shaw.

4536809,5,B0053O8ALE,"I'm not gonna lie, I first watched this show because John Reese is incredibly good looking (Bless Jim Caviezel and his perfect genes, like wow) and Harold Finch incredibly adorable. That's the surface deep. As I delve more into the series the more I fall in love with it.

While some people like a series because of the plot or the brilliant acting (POI has them both, btw) I tend to fall in love with small clever details like the transition between scenes. Keeping in line with the theme of the show, they use surveillance cameras and similar elements for transition in between shots and I think that's very clever. It's eye catching, but it makes the transition very smooth and immersing.

The story itself is compelling. We are constantly under surveillance. It's interesting to see what one can potentially do with that power  those who control information control the world, so to speak.

The two heroes seem to make the perfect balanced duo  the brain and the brawn. Both characters seem very overpowered (Finch very very smart and Reese very very strong), but then again it's two people against the world, and we get to see that no matter how strong or smart you are there's always something out of your control.

And although John Reese's character may be stealing all the thunder (being the invincible American James Bond who looks unfairly hot in a suit) and all the action, Finch's character is an interesting one. Full of secrets and full of regrets, one can't help but be intrigued by him.

All in all POI is a series that has it all and I enjoyed it very much",1392249600,2,1574,4.620071684587813

Highly recommend.  I love TV shows that are filmed on location and not cheap TV sets with green screen like on NCIS.  NCIS is supposedly the #1 show and yet their cheap sets and going to the same locations are getting ridiculous.  The Mentalist is the same.  The Mentalist looked ridiculous by trying to pretend they were in NYC.  It was laughable!  Hey how about actually going to NYC. I hope CBS doesn't cheapen out on this show, otherwise I'm tuning out.",1392163200,,621,4.37719298245614

A computer genius with a strong conscience has designed a computer system which monitors internet communication, telephone and surveillance cameras in order to spot terrorist plots.  However the government ignores the sideline listings of criminal possibilities.
So our hero monitors those side incidents and enlists the aid of an ex spy, and eventually two police detectives as they endeavor to prevent the criminal incidents, saving imminent victims and along the way sometimes revealing a very touching side to their rescues.
You begin to admire the older, corrupt detective who discovers and embraces the right and courageous thing for a change, and you side with the honesty of the lady detective who is always there to do things right.  They develop a friendship and trust to protect and support each other. You begin to love them all!
The stories leave you with a good feeling and admiration of these people, each of them show their best, yet are human as we are.  Top notch and great stories!",1391817600,,1217,4.869565217391305

Now, like all TV and movies, you have to get over some common sense hurdles, like the fact that bad guys can never make a shot from a gun yet the good guys have more precise aim than a well trained sniper.

4536914,5,B0053O8ALE,"A high-concept show that isn't afraid to get down and dirty, this latest exercise in paranoid worldbuilding from producer J.J. Abrams provides an addictive combination of action and future tech. Series creator Jonathan Nolan (brother of Christopher) lays out the premise at a furious clip: an eccentric tech genius (Lost's Michael Emerson) enlists a shadowy soldier-of-fortune (Jim Caviezel) to help with his pet project--a machine with seemingly endless surveillance capabilities. Utilizing the device's ability to identify threats before they happen, they set out to right future wrongs, attracting the attention of a dogged New York cop (Taraji P. Henson) in the process. Were Person of Interest content to remain at the level of weekly procedural, it would be a very good one, with every installment boasting well-choreographed fight scenes, Emerson's impeccably weird comedy timing, and a thorny morality that keeps the methods of the protagonists edging into the black. (A standout early episode, featuring Linda Cardinelli as a doctor with a hidden past, boasts an open-ended resolution that would do Elmore Leonard proud.) Thankfully, however, Nolan and co. also show an ability to play the long game, cannily inserting flashbacks that hint at a bigger mystery, introducing a strangely empathetic recurring supervillain, and laying out minor plot elements that pay off big further down the line. The show's impressive planning also extends to the supporting cast, with Henson given a character arc that many leading characters would envy. (Kudos as well to Kevin Chapman, as a former dirty cop whose slowly growing conscience provides many of the best moments.) The best element of the show, however, may well be The Machine itself, an initially implausible gimmick that quickly becomes a character in its own right; an omnipresent asset that--pay close attention to the evolving graphics overlays--may not be quite as passive an observer as its creator insists. By the time the final cliffhanger episode of the season rolls around, it's apparent that the show's mythology still has plenty of unexplored depths to delve. Extras include a lengthier cut of the pilot, a fascinating/scary look at the current state of surveillance tech, and a brief gag reel showcasing Caviezel's ability to do a killer Christopher Walken.",1389571200,,2327,5.3780821917808215

Anyone who saw the ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" would understand why I'd want to watch such a series. Years later, after seeing a show called ""Fairly Legal"" and hearing about Person of Interest more and more over the years, I couldn't help but get more and more curious. I began watching the show, and finished the first season, enjoying each and every episode, and to me, it was like seeing a movie. The events unfolding could very well have fit into a movie made by Nolan, but nonetheless, the series works! Both Jim Caviezel's and Michael Emerson's characters are quite enigmatic, but compelling characters. And as usual, you learn more and more about them as the series unfolds. The villains amaze, and the finale well... just watch. I can't wait to start on Season 2, and finish catching up on this series. It is quickly becoming a favorite of mine.

Summary:
A supercomputer has been provided to the NSA in order to monitors every e-mail, cell phone, security camera, public and private databases in order to ferret out terrorist. One of the designers, Harold Finch, retains a ""back door"" to the computer, which is programmed to predict individuals in immediate danger of violent death. Although not stated it is apparent the program only monitors residence in the New York City area. Utilizing that person's identity Finch and his team attempt to prevent the death from occurring. For the record I watched the entire 1st Season over a period of a month. This was my first viewing of ""Person of Interest"".

Content:
Six disks - 23 episodes - original broadcasts 9/22/2011 to 05/17/12

Positive Comments:
This is a very plausible plot idea. NSA does employee such a supercomputer so we not in the realm of science fiction but just and extrapolation for dramatic purposes. Plausibility is very good in my book for a TV show.

The development over several episodes of a ""super villain"" kept my interest in the series.

Most episodes were highly dramatic and engaged and entertained this viewer.

The Cast:
The four principles are excellent and look and behave appropriately for their roles. Michael Emerson plays Harold Finch a nerdy computer designer with many secrets and an aversion to guns. His main operative John Reese (Jim Caviezel) is an on man-killing machine with his fists and an arsenal of weapons a small country would envy. Two New York City detectives played by Taraja Henson - Detective Carter and Kevin Chapman - Detective Fusco unofficially assist Finch and Reese.

Negative Comments:
Within the 23 episodes hundreds of bullets are direct towards Reese with only one making it mark - seems strange but it just a TV show.

The back-story of Reese and Finch are worked into the series during many of the shows. This sub-plot is very pertinent to the story line but could confuse viewers who have missed episodes.

Recommendations:
This series does not insult your intelligence for the most part - in fact it is quite thoughtful particularly in the area of government surveillance. I would recommend it and will purchase Season 2 as soon as the price for used come down.",1385078400,,2265,4.923884514435696
4537126,5,B0053O8ALE,"I was...a huge fan of ""The Equalizer"", the mid-1980s CBS series with Edward Woodward playing the jaded former CIA operative Robert McCall, who had settled in New York and used his skill set to help people in trouble.
  In many ways, ""Person Of Interest"" could be called ""The Equalizer Updated"".  Jonathan Nolan and J.J. Abrams have mixed a look at the world post-9/11--the world of security versus privacy--with a little old-fashioned cop drama, and come up with something fascinating.  Plus, the casting of the series was first rate.
  I've been a long-time admirer of Jim Caviezel's work.  From ""The Thin Red Line"" to ""Angel Eyes"", Caviezel has always brought those wide and expressive eyes and some magnificent understatement to his acting.  Many actors who have played Jesus on film have fallen into bad luck finding work after those performances.  Caviezel--the lead in 2004's ""The Last Temptation Of The Christ""--really never had that happen.  He became Number Six in 2009's remake of ""The Prisoner"", and in 2011 became the lead character in this series, the former Army Special Forces operator and CIA operative named John Reese.  Reese is the classic TV action hero--a tall man who can shoot, fight and think; posessed of a dry humor and a big heart.  But what flips the series...is Michael Emerson.
  Emerson is ANYTHING but the typical hero.  Anyone who ever watched ""Lost"" can never forget Emerson--as the magnificent villain Ben Linus--eulogizing John Locke.  Emerson is a bug-eyed, buzz-cut wonder; and how he embodies the reclusive software billionaire Harold Finch--injured, limping, unable to turn without turning his whole body; but deeply committed to using The Machine to stop crime before it happens...it's magnificent work.  Emerson fits with Caviezel in two fascinating roles--both Reese and Finch have had to give up much, but they do all they can to stop evil from befalling others; Reese bringing the physical and Finch bringing the computer/hacking.
  I was surprised that Taraji P. Henson came back to television.  I don't know why, but I was.  I can only assume that Nolan and Abrams blew her off her feet with their vision of Joss Carter, the NYPD detective looking to bring ""The Man In The Suit"" (TMITS) to justice initially...only to end up working with him.  TPH has always been a high-quality, high-energy actress; and she gets helped here by the backstory that Jon and J.J. develop for Carter.
  Kevin Chapman's development and evolvement as Lionel Fusco is first-rate.  He plays Fusco as a lifelong New Yorker--originally, a dirty cop who gets beaten/cajoled/teased into ""enlightenment"" by Reese--who is cynical and big hearted, increasingly so in both arenas, as the season develops.
It would be remiss to not mention The Machine.  In many ways it is the biggest star of the show.  It's never really seen except in it's development stages, but because it is producing the Social Security numbers that identify the POI--whether the person is victim or perpetrator--The Machine and it's backdoor sits as a huge, unseen presence.
  Season 1--as most television series are present day--sets the stories and the players.  We meet Reese, and see his backstory through flashbacks; we meet Finch; and start getting his backstory through flashbacks.  We see how the relationship between Reese and Finch develops--Reese wanting to know more about Finch, but Finch being reclusive within the library he bought from NYC.  We watch John and Harold turn Carter and Fusco into partners, but neither Joss or Lionel know the other is working for ""Wonderboy"", as Fusco calls him.  We meet the beautiful ""fixer"", Zoe Morgan.  Paige Turco is aging incredibly well, and she has a wonderful chemistry with Caviezel in their scenes.  Of course, we also meet the antagonists--the group of corrupt police officers known as HR; and embodied with considerable menace by Robert John Burke.  Enrico Colantoni's Charlie Burton--a number The Machine produces in the first half of the season--turns out to be Carl Elias, the illegitimate son of a New York Mob boss who has the goal of bringing the Five Families back to prominence under his rule.  Michael Kelly's Mark Snow, Reese's former CIA handler who wants to bring Reese back to Washington--feet first.  Annie Parisse's Kara Stanton, Reese's partner in The Company who seems a little too fatalistic in her devotion to the job.  Finally, there's Amy Acker.  Again, introduced as a ""number"" named Samantha Groves, Acker's character is revealed to be the dangerously unstable hacker named Root, who is looking for The Machine.
  Overall, ""Person Of Interest"" establishes a look--one that is not very comfortable--at the way modern society handles the threat matrix, and how some may take advantage of access...for either good or evil.  Season One was a fascinating opener--watching Caviezel bring Reese back into the game and back to life, watching Finch slowly let his guard down around Reese; how Carter and Fusco evolve from pursuing TMITS into working/supporting him; and the battle lines the group develops against HR, Elias's power grab, and Root.  It's a very good show enhanced by quality work from a great group of actors.

4537244,2,B0053O8ALE,"Enjoy the first season. The second season is a major disappointment.

There's an exaggerated emphasis on special effects, macho confrontations, infantile violence based on comic book fantasies, sentimentality (in place of expected irony), improbable gun play and martial arts, moronically predictable dialog, some truly awful writing: No U.S. Navy aircraft carrier was ever named after a state (USS Colorado?) -- only battleships are named after states, and there is no such thing as a military ""contract"" (unless it is with civilians) -- joining the military is an enlistment. And why is it suddenly OK to criminalize America's brave special ops people?

The series has lost it edge. I was embarrassed to have recommended POI to some friends. The producers have turned what used to be interesting personal relationships and biting irony into commercial dreck. There's a lot of expensive breakage: car crashes, explosions, etc. All these trends, that emerged towards the end of the last season, are now full-blown cliches.

4537307,5,B0053O8ALE,"This is how to make a great show:
You start with Jonathan Nolan, visionary screenwriter behind Memento, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige. Nolan writes mind-bending, smart, and action-packed cinema that never fails to entertain. Then get J.J. Abrams on board. Abrams brings class and style to the game that always makes for slick, entertaining watching.

Then get actors of real calibre on board:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jim-Caviezel/dp/B003V5JZF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jim Caviezel</a>, an electrifying and mesmerizing actor who embodies badass in New York city like Clint Eastwood did in the Wild West. Caviezel is a brilliant method actor who is as at home taking down a gang of punks as he is giving an icy cool one-liner or acting in a surprisingly emotional and moving scene about his shadowy past. Add to that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Emerson/dp/B003U53I3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Emerson</a>, who is as PERFECT in his role as secretive billionaire Mr. Finch as Dustin Hoffman was in Rain Man! Emerson nails all the ticks and qualities of his shadowy character, down to the limp and the stiff posture. Mix in Taraji P. Henson, who is entertaining and a worthy sidekick to our two brilliant leads. Then stir thoroughly.

Then add liberal doses of fast-paced, riveting plot, smart and sharp dialogue, slick and realistic characters, twists, turns, and plot twists everywhere you turn, but never succumb to overly dark and cynical contemplation (See: The Mentalist). Then, be technically brilliant: know how to shoot action like Michael Mann, use music like an UTTER pro for maximum effect, be tasteful and stylish in your camerawork, and edit like a boss.

Mix liberally with New York City, amazing one-liners, and technical jargon that EVERYONE can understand. Sprinkle with black humor and hand-to-hand combat. Serve chilled. You have PERSON OF INTEREST, one of the most riveting, stylish, well-acted, and interesting shows on television right now. I watched two episodes and I was hooked!

4537381,5,B0053O8ALE,"Love shows about spies and intelligence all the way back to the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and this is one of the very best. The second season is better than the first one. Just like Jack Bauer, Michael Westen. John Reese and Harold Finch are totally cool.

When 24 went off the air I thought that I was done with shows about spies and covert operations. But Person of Interest has such a cool twist on this genre with the Machine. This show demands that you actually use your head to figure out what is going on and sometimes the plots are very complicated.

The one sad thing is that most good shows like this are good for 5 seasons, such as was the case with 24 and then after that they tend to go downhill. The writers become bored or run out of things to write about and they tend to start repeating the same story lines. Let's hope that this doesn't happen to Person of Interest. Burn Notice should have ended after the 5th season but executives have to line their pockets and squeeze every dime out of a show that they can.

I am really looking forward to Season 3 with Shaw coming back and Root. What a terrific show. I love these characters.

My only complaint is the some of the political correctness that they have to throw in nowadays. 24 was criticized because of the fact that Jack Bauer used torture to extract information from bad guys and now they have to make a point to say in every other show ""torture doesn't work/"" Com'on get past the PC crap.

Episode five has two of THE BEST Opening scene/ Closing scenes that I've ever seen ""I recommend the eggs benedict"".

While I think the acting is decent and the premise sounded intriguing, I'm overall somewhat bored with it.  I could easily turn it off at this point and return the whole 1st season set back to the library without any qualms.  Granted, I'm only on disc 3 of the 1st season so maybe it gets better?

To each his own.  And maybe my disappointment isn't even fair in that I was looking for something to fill the void after I finished watching the entire FRINGE series.  Gosh, I loved that show.  Really, ""Person of Interest"" didn't sound at all like FRINGE but I was hoping it would draw me in.  Nope.

Anyone out there have a tip or two for a series or movie to relieve the FRINGE withdrawals? :)",1376265600,2,844,4.284810126582278
4537428,5,B0053O8ALE,"Hi Folks,
In a world of TV blah blahs, ""Person of Interest"" is a refreshing breath of stories well written combined with superior acting by Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson. Caviezel know for The Passion of Christ playing Jesus The Messiah and from other notable acting in the movie ""Frequency"" with Dennis Quaid. Emerson is best lately known for playing the antagonist Benjamin Linus in the TV series ""Lost"".
This is a perfect combination of the Crime Fighting Odd Couple. Emerson play's the mysterious ""Harold Finch"" The computer/software/internet/financial analyst Guru Billionaire with limitless resources through ""The Machine"". Caviezel plays John Reese former Green Beret and former CIA ""Black Ops"" Agent. Prior to being recruited by Finch Reese is betrayed by someone (a 3rd party deep mole(s) in the CIA that try to kill him and his CIA partner during a Black Ops mission. He doesn't know why they want him dead. After recovering from the near fatal trap, Reese becomes a drifter/street person in order to try to escape the person or persons that tried to have him ""wasted"" and would still try to kill him if they knew he was still alive.  He also, from severe alcoholic daily binging, is on the verge of seriously considering taking his own life which he hates as it turned out thus far and prior to Finch's intervention. This is a story of a form of redemption. Finch shows Reese that he can take his skills and team up with Fitch to save innocent victims and deal out Street Justice to evil people mixed with working initially anonymously with The Police.  Reese reluctantly agrees after blowing Fitch off a couple of times until he sees that ""The Machine"" and Fitch have offered him a new beginning and a reason to get up in the morning.  ""The Machine"" was created secretly by the US Government by Fitch to be able to detect Terror acts and other threats to the United States. Fitch finds out that ""The Machine"" also regularly detects victims and predators by analysis of multi-media data turns out people's names with dates of incidents. The problem is ""The Machines"" doesn't know which people identified are either a victim or predator. Finch and Reese have to find out in time to save the victim and stop the predators. I suggest that you view a couple of episodes via ""Utube"" or even the CBS website before you purchase Season One to see if you like the show.  One last note: Jim Caviezel regularly spends time working out with the real ""U.S. Navy Seals"" to perfect his hand to hand fighting capabilities in order to make his fight scenes on the series as real as possible for the audience. Obviously he tempers the timing and impact of those combat moves so as not to injure his fellow (bad guy) actors on the set.  I like it and recommend this First Season""  Hope this helps.
Blessings,
Phil",1376179200,,2809,4.710794297352342

4537431,4,B0053O8ALE,"It took me a few episodes to get hooked, but it is a fascinating series. Now that we are in the Snowden and Wikileaks era, the whole concept of government surveillance and invasion of privacy has great relevance. The premise is that the government has a supercomputer that can do surveillance and identify and stop potential terrorists. But the billionaire genius behind its production has found a way to tap into it and run the programs that identify individual citizens who are about to meet up with some harm (a weird and slightly mad performance by Michael Emerson). He teams up with a partner, one of the walking wounded ex-CIA agents, to prevent the crimes (the enigmatic,emotionally deep Jim Caviezel). However, I felt some of the individual episodes were too focused on vigilante justice. As with all vigilante justice, be prepared for a high rate of murder and bloody acts against the perpetrators of crime to save the intended victims. If focused on the larger issues of government interference, surveillance, invasion of privacy and the abuse of individual rights it would be better. When focused on vigilante justice it simply gets violent and bloody. It is worth watching, because it is getting better and better, and I believe the next season will take it to another level. It is always good to see the excellent Jim Caviezel, and this is probably his best work since his extraordinary performance in Terence Mallick's brilliant The Thin Red Line.

Well Person of Interest has caught my interest. The way in which this show is written and the acting has made me an automatic fan. It has the components of Burn Notice but does it a bit better. Where Burn Notice has gone down a darker path, Person of Interest still has that feel where they are not taking themselves way too serious to make it dark. With so much going on around us these days, it is refreshing to find a show where you can enjoy yourself for a while without having to be depressed.

Jim Caviezel is so believable as an ex-CIA operative who is ruthless, but sensitive and compassionate, even though he has enough emotional baggage (personal and professional) to sink him.  He's paired with billionaire, nerdy, tech genius, Michael Emerson.  They are a superhero duo for the millennium.  The plot, written two years ago, comes right out of today's headlines about the NSA.  The realism of the acting, the accuracy of the environment is amazing, but be warned, it can be violent and bloody.

By the end of the season, POI turned into one of the two best TV shows on TV (along with THE GOOD WIFE), not including cable TV.

4537679,5,B0053O8ALE,"This is a great show, very thought provoking. Although the AI computer program watching everything and everyone is a fantasy right now with our current technology (the power to run it, engineering it, along with an AI capable of doing it will be impossible for a good number of years), the current news about what the NSA is doing shows that if the government had full control over something like The Machine, we'd be more screwed than we are now. Anyone see Minority Report? Like that, but instead of the three precogs viewing murders before they happen, imagine a 'god' viewing everything and everyone at all times, it could stop murder, theft, rape, or anything else the government may want to stop at some point: sodomy, buying/selling guns, anti-government conversations, laziness, etc.

And you can't say ""if my team were controlling the government, it'd be okay"" like some republicans are saying now. And many democrats now are saying ""well my team now is doing it, and I have nothing to hide, so it's okay"" With that I'd like to point out three thoughts:

1. Every American Is Probably a Criminal - read Three Felonies A Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent (http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Innocent-ebook/dp/B00505UZ4G/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1) - about how the average American commits several federal and state felonies a day. You know that ticket you got in the mail for running a red light that the traffic cam saw? Imagine that everywhere for everything you do that is currently illegal or may become illegal.

2. The Federal Government Has Abused its Surveillance Powers Before - you can peruse google and wikipedia for everything on that, no need to add a list here.

3. Government Is Made of People, and Some People Are Creepy, Petty, Incompetent, or Dangerous - this is more in line with various people with access to information that can stop a grassroots organization you belong to, or stalk you, or publicly humiliate you, or any number of things.

Of course, this has to do with this show because what if the government had some access to The Machine, or it's real life counterpart, but wanted more, while trying to cover up its existence? Basically, that is the continuing arch of the story of Person of Interest. Of course there is a lot more to it, and the whole government business doesn't come in until season 2, it lays the groundwork for it this season. This season is mainly about introductions, conflict between the good guys, and your usual crime of the week procedural stuff. I imagine that due to what is going on in real life regarding the NSA, expect season 3 to focus more and more on the government's role in trying to control The Machine. Of course I think they were heading in that direction anyway, but we'll see.",1371081600,,2757,4.845010615711253

After school got out, I had forgotten about the series until I kept hearing more and more good things about it. Finally, I decided ""what the hey?"" and ordered it. I have not regretted it since.

Not only was the delivery speedy, effecient, and on time, but thanks to the Amazon Prime selection, I was able to buy the first season for only $14.00, a real good bargain considering the season had come out not too long ago and are usually pretty expensive at first. As for the first season itself, this made the purchase even better. Strong and intriguing characters, action packed and suspenseful stories, and smart, well crafted writing. The first season also has a number of bonus features that go into behind the scenes of the show with things like extended pilot commentary, a gag reel, and a featurette about the technology in the show which covers a good number of bases for film and tv fans like myself. I have not quite finished watching the season yet but I am about fifteen episodes in and don't plan to stop there. When I finish this season, I look forward to catching up with the second season and watching the third, and maybe even plan to watch several episodes of the first season over again.

It's develops the ability to perceive individual dilemmas  and write it's own code to carry out an agenda of it's own making, one of which is to protect it's maker. So far they have rightfully avoided going into soap-opera territory by not allowing Caviezel's character to indulge in a love interest. There is one old flame that visits him periodically but it's kept on a strictly professional basis. All the characters are likable and keep you coming back each week. Each character is memorable and has their own story to tell. My only complaint is that the show went on hiatus two times during the middle of season two. My short-term memory is pickled so it was hard to remember parts of the complex story line after several weeks of absence. They need to show all the shows in sequence without interruption. Hope this show goes on for at least ten seasons or more.",1370044800,,1111,4.72680412371134

Folks at Warners must have been smoking some funny 'baccy as they have crammed the box with the complete series on four Blu-rays and also included the series on six DVDs !

A must buy for fans of the show.",1370044800,,359,4.173913043478261
4537765,5,B0053O8ALE,One of the few television shows that rewards repeated viewings.  The strands of information that refer back to previous episodes can be mystifying and frustrating if you haven't watched all earlier shows.  Why Michael Emerson hasn't won an Emmy  (let alone nominated) for his work is beyond belief.  The frightening aspect of this series is that---much of it may be true.  We are being watched all the time.  It may make you want to get rid of your GPS and your cell phone!,1369958400,,473,4.63855421686747
4537766,5,B0053O8ALE,"I discovered this show in the middle of the second season and was hooked by the outstanding actors and well written story lines.  Since I had missed almost a season and a half of the show I naturally wanted to go back to the beginning.  I purchased the blu-ray edition of the first season from Amazon for $19.00 and have not been disappointed.  I have added the show to my DVR along with my two other favorites Homeland and the Walking Dead, which is high praise indeed.  If you have not seen the first season of this show on TV then this is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the characters and see how they have developed over time.  Highly recommended!",1369872000,,659,4.368852459016393
4537767,5,B0053O8ALE,"When I first saw the previews to ""Person Of Interest"", I wasn't interested.  It seemed kind of dry and slow.  Then one day, I decided to give it a try.  After the first episode, I was more than interested - I was hooked.  Each episode of Person Of Interest is exciting - lots of twists and turns.  The characters have developed a smooth  synchronization early in the series, unlike other shows where it takes the characters two or three seasons to develop a smooth rhythm.  Person Of Interest is now part of my weekly must-see shows.",1369785600,,533,4.489583333333333

4537769,5,B0053O8ALE,Fell in love with Mr. Reeves and his hiden jobs.  Got hooked on tv 1st season.  But had to leave house to work. Was excited to find it at Amazon.,1369699200,,145,3.8
4537770,4,B0053O8ALE,"At first, this show seemed to me to be just interesting enough to keep my mind occupied after a minor surgery, when I wasn't able to get up and about. Then, when I got better, I put it aside. A few months later, I resumed watching it. After episode #7 (""The Witness""), I decided that this show is really good. It seems that the plots are getting cleverer and more complex, and that there is now more continuity from episode to episode. And the three main actors (who portray Reese, Finch, and Carter) are perfectly cast and superbly portray their roles. I am about to start Disc #3 (Blu-ray) as I write.

Now, even with JJ Abrams et al involved, don't expect another ""Lost,"" which was outrageously ""out there"" and had a large ensemble cast. But I kind of like having a few characters that you can begin to get to know as you progress through the episodes. My curiosity about each of them is heightened as I continue to watch. Questions become answered, but the answers raise new questions, too.

Here's a packaging feature that I like about this combo set: it contains a printed ""program"" of episodes and which discs they are on, for both Blu-ray and DVD. Makes it easier to resume where you left off, if you switch back & forth between Blu-ray & DVD players, as I do.",1369699200,,1268,4.437768240343348
4537771,5,B0053O8ALE,"CBS' latest hit drama PERSON OF INTEREST was created by Jonathan Nolan (the brother of producer, director & screenwriter Christopher Nolan), and it boasts not only a strong premise, but also a strong main cast. Jim Caviezel (Angel Eyes, Alexandre Dumas' The Count Of Monte Cristo, The Passion Of The Christ) is perfectly suited for the role of John Reese aka The Man In The Suit, a former CIA operative presumed dead who is recruited by a mysterious billionaire known only as Mr. Finch (Michael Emerson) to help prevent crimes from occurring. Their only source of information is a Machine that Finch built.

That's just the wrapping. The present is still waiting to be opened, and it is truly a wonderful gift, indeed. All of the episodes feature humour in some form (never crude), and a lot of heart. The music is really good, and the production values are always top-notch. There is plenty of action, to be certain, and it is intense, but never graphic, and the language is moderate, and no sexual situations. This is a television show that you can watch with kids 10 and up, and not worry about objectionable content. What I like about Mr. Nolan is that his work (which he usually does with his brother Christopher Nolan) is that their projects are always designed to make you think; cerebral rather than sensual, and that's a refreshing change in today's culture, where you are bombared with movies, television shows and advertising that glamorises sex in the wrong way. There's even a special episode for you fans of Alexandre Dumas' The Count Of Monte Cristo (Mr. Caviezel's first-famous role before Mel Gibson offered him the Role that any actor in Hollywood should be honoured to play: our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ).

Special Features include an Extended Version of the pilot episode, Extended Pilot Episode With Executive Producer Commentary, a 15-20 minute featurette Living In An Age Of Surveillance with brief commentary from the main cast and mostly from technical advisors on the show, executive producer Greg Plageman, and of course, creator, executive producer, writer (and now director) Jonathan Nolan, and a brief but hilarious Gag Reel showing takes from episodes where the actors mess up a line or a cue.

Fans of the series will be delighted to know that CBS has renewed the show for a third season, and it's being moved from Thursdays at 9/8 central to Tuesday nightst at 10/9 central right after NCIS: Los Angeles. Only CBS. If only CBS would make this series available via XFinity On Demand.

Rated TV-14 (intense violence, moderate language).",1369612800,,2572,4.905747126436782

4537825,5,B0053O8ALE,"In the commentary for the broadcast version of the pilot, they mention that they had a lot of extra footage, so whittling it down to the 45 or so minutes they're limited to in a broadcast was hard.

I really enjoyed seeing the longer version, it was fun to see things that were only hinted at in the broadcast version.

This show is so much fun. Sure, there's lots of action and drama, but it's character based, so there's also humor and romance to balance things out. Visually? I think this is one of the most interestingly visual shows currently on the air. They do a great job letting the audience see things from the point of view of The Machine.

I bought this season because I got it cheaply, but I'm really glad I did. I'd forgotten how much is going on here, and how well it all develops over the life of the show.",1368662400,,822,4.256410256410256

Like any great novel you have to get to know the characters, the main ones as well as the supporting ones. The story line can be intricate,with a main plot and several subplots, so you have to pay attention to details and flashbacks(especially in season 2 when season 1 events become more significant).

4537843,4,B0053O8ALE,"Aspects of this TV show that I like are the truly gifted script writers, though nothing original, the stories are VERY cleverly crafted. Not all episodes are top-rate, like every production they have a budget for the season, and can only hire so many top writers and directors for the season. But I'm glad I bought this first season, and I plan to buy season 2 also.

What I don't like is that the ""good"" guys think the ends justify the means. John Reese thinks that he can shoot, and beat people to get a result that prevents the death of a certain charactor in the episode. Harold Finch, the software genius, thinks he can hack into databases in order to do the same thing.

Got the first season to catch-up on what I have missed and cannot wait for 2nd season to come to DVD/Blue Ray! My Wife and Daughter did not like it at first either but now they are hooked on the show also! ( only fair, they got me liking NCIS and I did not like it at 1st either ) Kind of reminds me of Bourne but also not. Actor James Caviezel ( John ) does a terrific role and the cast works well together. Michael Emerson( Harold )Taraji P. Henson ( Det. Carter N.Y.P.D.) & Kevin Chapman ( Det. Fusco ) are the main characters. The 4th disc on the blue ray has outtakes and WOW does James Caviezel do an amazing Christopher Walken impersonation !!!

It is a pleasure to watch an action series with such a good cast. Second, the script is also well written. Though the central idea may not be entirely new, what is original is the approach to it: the plot is connected to contemporary real world (unlike other action films based on the fantastic element) and the main characters are not viewed as static, but undergo a process of psychological development. Other qualities of ""Person of Interest"" are the humorous dimension, as the banter between Reese and Finch is a pendant to the action scenes, and the intertextual allusions, because some scenes allude to scenes of famous movies, from a (positive) parodic perspective. Clearly, the series is addressed to fans of action movies who want something more than a simple succession of fight scenes. I'd say it is also addressed to those who are tired of seeing leading actresses in police TV series, who look rather old and stiff. James Caviezel makes an amazing and verosimile Mr Reese, whether it comes to fight scenes or to psychological flashbacks, and Michael Emerson's role seems to fit him perfectly.

4537981,4,B0053O8ALE,"so this will be short and to the point. this box set houses all of season 1. its basically a thick bluray book case with 4 discs for the bluray side and 6 discs for the dvd side. it also comes with a code for ultraviolet which i actually think was a great idea. this is a first, as i've never seen tv series be bundled as a bluray/dvd combo before, and i think thats a great idea. less money on the manufacturers who make them to market them separately, and really it benefits us the consumers. for those who only want the dvds, this set is great as it'll give you a chance as well in the future to watch the bluray when you do decide to upgrade to HD. no need to repurchase said series on bluray. for those who already done the upgrade, you'd primarily want the blurays obviously, but the dvds are great for us in case someone else in the house wants to see on their own pace and there for you don't need to lend out your blurays. all in all its a great set.

FOR THOSE SPANISH CONSUMERS READ FROM HERE
i was slightly upset that the dvds only come in english and guess what? PORTUGUESE! what the hell? its not even one of the three top languages in north america! thats what lead me to give it 4 stars only. i mean come on?! it should of been eng., french AND spanish! no one listens in portuguese! BUT, the blurays come in, eng, french, spanish(Castilian) and portuguese. its not south american spanish audio but there really is no difference between how the people in spain speak it to how south americans speak it. the only real difference is their accents. but its basically spanish audio for the blurays thats included. so if you were wondering about that, you can at least listen to it in spanish. i really have no idea why the companies did not include spanish audio on the dvd side. it really is a slap in our faces. i know that dvds cant hold as much data as blurays, but at least have eng. and spanish audio tracks avail on the dvd side of things. not just on the bluray side. not everyone has a bluray player and my mom really wanted to watch this series in spanish, so she had to upgrade for this set.

I am on a one person crusade to watch my favorite shows without crass commercials.  Commercials seem to be slapping us in the face every where we look.

4538028,5,B0053O8ALE,"I bought this without seeing one episode,just relied on reviews and i was not disappointed.
 Great picture and sound.
The basic storyline changes each episode,with various story arcs taking shape as the series progresses until a climatic last episode. The acting is good throughout and generally the stories are good.
In a nutshell a computer specialist builds a super computer to find anyone who is a danger to ""national security"" in America.
This computer is massive and uses every available means to track people using specific guidelines,words,actions etc, and so makes a list of who is most likely to cause ""problems"",but on this list are people who are in danger but are disregarded by the goverment..
The guys who designed it for the goverment decide to make a second list of all these disregarded people.
 List maybe the wrong word to use,a social security number is the only info the computer gives out,using this it tracks individuals.
As some of the story is told in flashback not all the history of the two guys involved in the supercomputer  is immediately known.
 You do find out one of them was killed in an accident,the other lives under an assumed name(Finch),in fact he has many names.
 Finch sets out to help those on the 2nd list(this is not without its problems,he is supposed to be dead) and so he enlists the help of a presumed dead ex-CIA? agent(Reese) who brings with him his own baggage and those seeking to make sure he is dead.
 So tracked by cops(aided by cops),CIA,and persons unknown,our two ""heroes"" help people,while trying to figure the other out,staying a step ahead of capture/death,keeping secrets from each other and making you smile along the way.
 There is more but watch it,to learn.
 In this set you get blu-ray/dvd/digital download.
 Extras are not much,a gag reel,deleted scenes,short look at how technology watches us.
Well worth the price i paid,30 dollars,i think.",1363824000,,1911,4.928348909657321

While the week to week formula is the same (a new POI needing investigating), the writers do a very good job of keeping everyone's role in the reported conspiracy a mystery. Also, as far as the season-long story arc, Only a little is ever revealed at a time, and even by the end of the season, although many questions have been answered, more questions have arisen, keeping you coming back for more.

I love the characters in the show and the interesting plots.  I would recommend the show to anyone who likes action and intriguing story lines.,1362441600,,295,4.327272727272727
4538166,5,B0053O8ALE,"I've watched ""Person of Interest"" since it first aired. Being a fan of the Nolan brothers' work already, I saw the connections the pilot made with ""Batman Begins"", but from there things became much more interesting. The Machine created by Mr. Finch and the problem he says it has, regarding relevant and irrelevant, was an interesting plot device as it captured, quite correctly, the feel of the world after 9/11 and Americans' need to feel protected.

The character of John Reese, haunted by the failure of helping the woman he loved when she most needed him, is given depth of character by Jim Cavaziel, and the character of the enigmatic and reclusive Harold Finch is played masterfully by Michael Emerson. I've heard some reviewers claim this series as being as without a plot as much as the J.J. Abrams' Lost, on which Michael Emerson also starred.

This, I think, is a laughable comparison. I have tried, time and again, to watch ""Lost"" and I keep losing interest around episode 5 or 6. This show, on the other hand, captures my interest and remains one I watch, again and again, and look forward to each and every new episode. The special guest star of Amy Acker (of ""Angel"" fame) was interesting, especially when it was revealed who she truly was right at the end of the season.

The character of Carl Elias, his involvement with several of the 'numbers' The Machine spits out, and the fact that he remains a threat of some sort thanks in large part to the Machine, is quite interesting as it brings the series to yet another level. With so many subplots, it would be easier for the writers to become *Lost*, but they do not.

Finally, the musical score they use is just amazing, and makes you feel much more involved in the series than any other musical score I've heard on a television series.

In terms of 'cons' to this show: well, I can't really think of any. The thing that I would probably improve upon is the possibility that they don't always succeed in saving the people in question. There have been a few episodes where that was the case, but for the most part, they succeed. I find the episodes of any series with people who are basically vigilantes being unable to save some of those they help to be more poignant and give the show an even more realistic edge. Person of Interest, for the most part, does have a realistic edge, but that is the one unrealistic edge to it. Sometimes, even with foreknowledge, you cannot stop what is coming. I would like to see more of this as the series continues.",1362441600,,2518,4.561946902654867

4538330,5,B0053O8ALE,I came late to this series and decided to take advantage of the low price for Season 1 on the basis of a colleague's recommendation and I think it is a great series!,1361232000,2,165,4.03030303030303
4538331,5,B0053O8ALE,"This show grips my full attention from the first scene and doesn't let go until the last. It occupies my fascination like no other show ever has. Some episodes are the most suspenseful I've ever seen on the ""small"" screen (getting bigger every day) as well as ""The Big Screen.""

But if you want to enjoy this show, do yourself a favor: suspend disbelief to a degree, or you're going to find plenty of things to criticize and dwell on. ""Why in a shoot out with six guys does Reese never get hit?"" ""Why is he captured on so many store and bar security cams (wired), but never gets caught by the NYPD or FBI (or CIA)?"" ""Why does Reese get knocked out with a tire iron but is never hospitalized for a concussion?"" To address every one of these issues for the sake of addressing them would occupy the entire 44 minute show, leaving little to no room for story or plot. If you can't watch the show without all kinds of hang ups, you won't enjoy yourself. Sit back and enjoy the ride, however, and you will.

Do yourself a favor and chalk up things that test credulity to the fact that Reese was a member of the U.S. Military's Special Forces and has mastered hand-to-hand combat such that he can take down four attackers. (Special Forces; you know, the military units that don't exist?) Plus, he is a former CIA agent and has mad espionage (spy) skills and techniques.

The show was created by Jonathan Nolan, who, with his brother, Christopher, co-wrote the screenplay for The Dark Knight, the most successful Batman film ever (adjusted for inflation). The brothers also co-wrote the screenplay for 2012's blockbuster, The Dark Knight Rises.

Jonathan Nolan's short story, Memento Mori, would become the story for the blockbuster film Memento.

Nolan doesn't seem to lower his standards for a television series after so much success in the feature film business; Person of Interest bears a high degree of quality you'd think he'd want to reserve for cinema. (Than you, Jon.)

Jim Caviezel is the optimal choice to play Reese. I can't picture a single other actor who could fill the role as perfectly. Acting isn't just about delivering lines. It is a generally accepted belief that 80% of communication is non-verbal. Besides delivering lines, acting is about presence, how an actor carries him- or herself, a look of the eyes, a turn of the head -- SO MUCH!

(He was also PERFECT in the mind-bending AMC miniseries, the remake of ""The Prisoner."" Of course, it won no awards either.)

Don't expect Person of Interest to pick up any Emmy Awards - EVER! Caviezel played Jesus in The Passion of the Christ. He was forewarned that if he took the part in the movie it might kill his film career due to Hollywood politics, but he did it anyway; and during filming was struck by lightning, was wounded when a prop Roman whip broke and actually slashed him; he dislocated a shoulder, suffered hypothermia and pneumonia.

Caviezel is a devout Catholic, gives speeches at religious events, will do tame ""in bed"" scenes but no sex scenes or nude scenes; he is happily married -- once (taboo!), has two adopted children from China and opposes EMBRYONIC stem-cell research, but NOT stem-cell research overall.

So, of course the Politics-drenched ""Academy of Television Arts & Sciences"" will NEVER award Person of Interest an Emmy, even though the show's Pilot episode drew the largest television audience in 15 years and consistently draws more than 10 million viewers each week (e.g. 14 million, 16 million). It is so successful that CBS bumped CSI from its Thursday night time slot -- which it held for more than 10 years -- to Wednesday, replacing it with Person of Interest.

That's why Person of Interest won a People's Choice Award, but will NEVER win an Emmy from the haughty ""Academy of...Blah, Blah, Blah.""",1361145600,7,3798,4.722054380664653
4538332,5,B0053O8ALE,"I am an avid fan of Person of Interest. Both main characters, Reese and Finch, are another version of the ""Odd Couple"" but with a more sinister flavor with a twist of dry humor. The character development builds and through flashbacks we get a sense of how these two men have now come together to fight evil. Supporting cast is interesting and engaging. Just when you think how much weirder can this get, it does. Superhero concept taken into an almost normal setting (they don't wear capes and the government watching is true enough).",1361145600,,534,4.691489361702128

It is of the genre of McGyver, Equalizer,The Pretender,The Avengers etc.

4538338,5,B0053O8ALE,"""You are being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know, because I built it.""

This is the premise of the entire series, if there isn't such a machine now, there will be soon. The 'machine' gives a number (Social Security Number in most cases) indicating the number's owner will be involved in some sort of violent, probably mortal, incident in the very near future. The 'machine' doesn't tell if the 'number' is the victim or the perpetrator, and that's what makes each story so interesting. Highly recommended.",1361059200,,576,4.76

I recommend it to people who like shows that make them think a little and can make your heart pound at times. Michael Emerson as always is PHENOMENAL as Harold Finch, Jim Caviezel is fantastic as John Reese, Taraji P. Henson is gorgeous and sassy as Detective Carter, and Kevin Chapman's Detective Fusco is sassier than Carter at times.

An awesome 4-piece team that meshes even better in season 2. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this.

As far as the package I received, there was slight damage to the box but I blame that on the mail service (most of my packages I've received as of late have been damaged a little). 6 discs of all 23 episodes plus the extended unaired pilot and a gag reel.

$20 for the DVD Boxset is a STEAL.",1360454400,,859,4.424050632911392

It seems slow at first because there's so much they have to set up and you, as a viewer, need to learn, but things are still happening on the show. This is one of those shows where lots of things are happening and the way they solve the cases is through a lot of technology with Finch and a lot of Black Ops smarts and whoop-*ss with Reese. By about the 5th episode, all the characters really start to depend on each other and you start to root for them to be friends as they work outside the law for a common cause for good.

As an extra treat, there's always a thread of a story in the background about the creation of the Machine and what happened to the characters to get them where they are today. If you pay attention to that, you'll find it's like a puzzle and the show is even better.

I'm glad I went ahead and got the dvds when they went on sale. Every time I watch them I notice something different.",1360454400,4,1183,4.112554112554113

4538712,5,B0053O8ALE,"Five stars for the series for sure! *****Awesome series with very complex multiple plots, on-going subplots and graphics that require your undivided attention. A real thinking person's drama! Images and dialog go by so fast you can miss alot of details if you can't stop and replay scenes and graphics from time to time. My husband and I felt it was well worth the price to buy the whole season's CD collection to rewatch the episodes very carefully to finally get all the details you missed in the actual airings. Pay close attention to ""the Machine"" 's graphics as it is constantly evaluating the situation and giving you information about characters you may not have understood very well just watching the drama unfold. The whole set was of excellent quality picture and sound but..
As for marketing the actual product... We had one ""pro and one ""con"" The Pro was that Amazon continues to offer the very best prices for anything digital or electronic you could ever want. Our local mega video store had the same 1st season series in ""regular"" dvd for $60! And since it is a very popular item, it was kept in the locked cabinet section of the video sales section! What a ripoff! Amazon saved us $40 bucks over that listed price. We did spend a little bit more by ordering it for 3day delivery so we could watch an all-day marathon over christmas vacation. That was worth it and it did show up on the exact date you said it would despite tons of Christmas deliveries clogging the system. The ""con"" was that there was no difference in the two types of sets offered. This is not Amazon's issue as we know you have no control over the product. It was the deception of the dvd manufacturer. We thought we were buying an upgraded product by buying Blu-ray but surprisingly this was a misconception and cost us a few extra bucks we could have saved for the higher shipping cost. The Blu-ray set contains a ""regular"" DVD set and a ""Blu-ray set""  2 separate disc sets in one package. Stupid waste really...10 discs altogether that we could not see any difference in picture quality. The Blu-ray set was condensed into 4 discs including the ""special features"" videos while the regular DVD was in 6. We played them both on our Blu-ray player but couldn't see any difference at all. Blu-ray technology when it first came out was supposed to be the new HD digital state of the art. However, that was several years ago. Now that ALL broadcasting is digital, plus all video content sold today is burned in digital format plus we all have  big screen HD TVs,  the ""regular"" DVD is of the same excellent quality as the original Blu-ray. So  don't be fooled into buying one format over the other or in our case,both. (We didn't know we were getting both sets) Regular digital is excellent in color, HD and sound.",1358812800,3,2796,4.586

Then I switched over to Criminal Minds... That show kept me guessing; very interesting (the first two seasons anyway).

PoI (As I like to call it), is a very interesting show that will keep you guessing. It's already in season two, and you'd think  they'd be out of ideas as how to keep it interesting... You're wrong!

You'll meet a character in one episode and not see him for the rest of the season OR you may not see him for fifteen episodes and completely forget about him.

Not going to ramble on about how good it is; it'd take too long. Get it and see for yourself... You have thirty days to return it.

Very addicting drama, good acting, beautiful eye candy in Mr Caziezel and clever story arc.  The premise is completely believable too.

4538825,5,B0053O8ALE,"I bought the blu-ray/DVD combo pack, and it was worth every penny. The visual quality of the blu-rays looks great on my HDTV through my PS3. Everything looks very crisp, the colors look vibrant and cool when they're supposed to. Everything you'd expect in a high quality blu-ray. The audio is excellent, too. Jim Caviezel was kind of hard to hear sometimes when I was watching the program on air since he speaks in a low voice a lot, but the audio is clearer on the blu-ray, imo. I have not experienced any hiccups or artifacting anywhere, so rest assured that you'll be getting great playback.

This may seem silly, but the menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate. I love how while I'm watching an episode, I can press the UP button on my PS3 controller to pull up the menus, see which episode I'm on, etc. all while being non-intrusive on the episode. I haven't tried this on a regular blu-ray, but it works well if you are playing your disc through a PS3. The menus are also broken down into tiers, so submenus pop up as a line right above the main menus, which I prefer instead of clicking a menu and going to a whole other screen.

The show doesn't have a ton of extras on these discs, but at least there are some. There are some commentary extras and such. Not too many behind the scenes. I think there is an extended pilot, which I have yet to watch, but all in all, I'm happy with what they put on the discs. If you were looking forward to a ton of extras content, then you may be disappointed in this department, but I found it to be satisfactory.

The packaging is pretty nice. It comes in a well constructed slip cover, and then all the discs are housed in a booklet format. Blu-rays, then the DVD discs. There is also a paper for anyone who wants UltraViolet copies (I personally hate UV from prior experiences, but that's just me). It's hard to explain, but I'm sure most people have had packaging where the discs are difficult to get out. When you push down on the middle section to release the disc, and sometimes there isn't a good place to grip the edge of the disc or the mid-section just won't let go--this is not the case with this package. All the discs are secure, while also being easy to take out for quick disc swapping. It just goes to show that whoever made the packaging put some thought and care into it, and that this is a quality product.

Lastly, I typically focus on the product itself since people buying a season/film already know all about it, but I just wanted to write a brief blurb about my opinions on the show. I watched this series from day one because I am a huge fan of the Nolan brothers' work (Jonathan is the brother of Christopher Nolan who co-wrote and directed the recent Batman trilogy, Inception, The Prestige). If you enjoy their films, then it is extremely likely that you will enjoy this show. The protagonist, John Reese, is an ex-military agent who specialized in counter-terrorist hit jobs, living off the radar. He is a mysterious and dark anti-hero, much in the vein of Batman. His partner, Harold Finch, is a reclusive billionaire and computer genius who built a machine for the government to basically spy on the entire country through 24/7 wiretaps, surveillance camera footage, etc. It is built to detect and prevent acts of terror, but it ignores other premeditated acts of crime. Finch finds John and they become partners in trying to stop violent crimes. Early on, John recruits a dirty cop, Fusco, who, as the show progresses, reveals himself to be a respectable man who actually cares about helping people. Another detective, Carter, chases ""the man in a suit,"" what the police say when referring to John. Carter is a straight cop who does not put up with corruption, or vigilantism.

All of these characters, along with many minor and recurring characters build a suspenseful, character-rich, and intricate storyline with multiple sub-plots. In my summary, it becomes pretty clear that there are many connections between this show and the Batman trilogy, so if you want a complex crime drama (I'd say this show is most closely akin to The Dark Knight), then this show will surely not disappoint. The acting is superb, too, with a great cast. Many of the actors are immediately recognizable (Jim Caviezel, Michael Emerson, Michael Kelly) and all the rest play their parts very well. It's an intelligently written and directed series that will always have you wanting more, as each episode ends with a question, cliff-hanger, or a satisfying character engagement that leaves the audience wanting to explore their world even more.

Basically: I highly recommend this series, and this blu-ray copy of it. Both top notch!!",1358035200,4,4693,4.634615384615385

4538848,5,B0053O8ALE,"Best show on network TV. The back stories of the main charachters is what I find most compelling about this series. The show is a combination of SciFi and crime drama. The writers do a great job of not revealing whether the current episode's ""Person of Interest"" is the victim or perpetrator until about half way through it. The conversations between Reese, Finch, Carter, and Fusco are well writen and add a touch of humor to the show. Also I really like when a show has continuing supporting charachters who show up at irregular intervals, but fit the stories nicely.",1357603200,,569,4.7

I started watching the series late in the season last year, so having the complete first season allowed me to ""catch up"" on what was happening, and in order.  It was also nice watching the series without commercials, as this allowed for a better ""flow"" of the storyline.  I also enjoy the casting of the show, as the characters of Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson bring credibility and humor to the series.  Also, the writers do an excellent job with bringing the information age we now live in to life on screen.

4538852,4,B0053O8ALE,"Took a chance and bought the DVD without ever seeing an episode of the show, since it is not currently available streaming anywhere on CBS site, Hulu, Netflix,can't even rent epsidodes on Amazon or I Tunes!

But it was worth it (about twenty bucks) way better than the forty five dollar price showing all of December.

Oh yeah, you're supposed to review the TV show, right? Well it is great. It's got all the key elements I love in a trashy action flick. Car chases, twists, action, simple plots, they've done a lot here considering it is TV it's more like feature film quality.

Only drawback is that althought the two lead actors are excellent, and it makes for a great ""buddy"" flick ( a continuous one, of course) the supporting actors the woman cop and the guy cop still are just that. Supporting.

Also, in comparison to action shows like Nikita on the CW, which this show somewhat resembles,
there is just one guy in the ""control room"" running operations. In Nikita, there is a whole cast.
That is OK, but it seems boring to just watch the same 2 guys all the time.

It's probably better if you're just seeing it once a week, but at 4 episodes a clip, it is more obvious how lean the cast is. The writing is excellent, the final editing is top notch. They really pack it in.

But still, it's like going to see a Broadway Show or Play where there are only 2 actors or even 4. There's just so much you can take of seeing the same guys doing the same thing.

I get it that this is another ""Lost"" production. But I didn't get that one either. Like this better than Lost though. Would be great if they could add some more actors, especially some
women. I like the woman cop character, but don't quite buy her in the role. They give her the
""story"", but the actress doesn't quite have the edge for the part.

Anyways, prolly the most I have ever written about a trashy fun TV show. Still love the show.
Just like Hawaii 5-0 and Nikita better. Even Revolution had more of an arc. Game of Thrones well thats a whole nother ball game.",1357084800,2,2031,4.326315789473684

4538856,5,B0053O8ALE,Love Jim Caviezel and really enjoyed to plot twists. Plot gets more complicated as the season goes on and we learn more about everyones past. Each show does stand alone and can be view without missing anything.,1357084800,,210,4.702702702702703
4538887,5,B0053O8ALE,"""See? Surveillance is your friend,"" whispered my big brother. CBS's PERSON OF INTEREST looks to be a head above its competition in replacing the urgently-paced thrill show that was 24. In this post-9/11 era, an age in which technology grows at an exponential pace, television executives have continued to massage our paranoia. PERSON OF INTEREST happens to be an electrifyingly good show.

Each episode begins with a worrisome opening voiceover: ""You are being watched. The government has a secret system: a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know because... I built it."" You have to admit it's a good hook.

Somewhere in the afterlife a smug George Orwell is raking in the ""Hey, good call, buddy"" comments from his dead brethren. We're one step closer to his nightmarish vision. But you can look at it thru a rosy lens. When the Towers came down a decision was made by our government to step up its anti-terrorist activities. So, like it or lump it, the Patriot Act. And then there was Mr. Finch's baby.

The reclusive billionaire/computer genius Mr. Harold Finch (not his true name) some years ago created a revolutionary security software that accurately predicts acts of terrorism by sifting thru and analyzing random emails, phone conversations, and surveillance systems. It then alerts the relevant governing agency: the FBI, the NSA, whichever. But here's the catch: Finch's program sees everything. It doesn't only predict threats on a national scale. But the government deems the smaller crimes - crimes that target the ordinary individual - to be irrelevant. Mr. Finch, before his change of heart, argued for that: ""We didn't build this to save somebody. We built this to save everybody.""

But Mr. Finch (Michael Emerson, excellent), whom everyone now believes dead, has had a change of heart. It bothers him that these ""irrelevant"" crimes are being neglected. He has an expanding list of social security numbers the computer spits out daily, social security numbers belonging to ordinary folks who will shortly be involved in something shady, folks who will either be victims or perpetrators. Mr. Finch decides to do something about this, on the sly. He can't do it alone. He's not a man of action. He's got a bum leg and he's perpetually uneasy in his own skin. He needs someone on the field. He's sizing up that homeless gent what just had a skirmish on the subway train.

PERSON OF INTEREST - along with SUITS, ELEMENTARY, BONES, and CASTLE - is the show I look forward to the most. It's such good television. Partly, it addresses and gratifies that sense of paranoia in all of us. Partly, there's that question mark hovering over whether the person of interest of the week is victim or perpetrator. It's that the episodes are consistently well-executed and action-packed and that the mythology being constructed on a weekly basis is so compelling. The cast is across-the-board excellent. Jim Caviezel as the haunted ex-military, ex-covert operative John Reese is marvelous. I love that his laconic delivery, his cadence, reminds me so much of Clint Eastwood's. John Reese has bottomed out on that New York subway train, wracked with remorse, deadened by guilt, a man in need of purpose. Plus, his beard looks like a rat's nest. When Mr. Finch offers him a chance for redemption, he takes it. As he informs one thug: ""Went around the world looking for bad guys. But there are plenty of you right here all along."" Off they go, two men believed to be dead, working in secret and hand-in-hand with a godlike machine. This machine, too, keeps a secret.

It's gripping television. Watching the show, it does concern me that it's so easy now to invade someone's privacy. Reese and Finch don't think twice about cloning cell phones, hacking into computers, or applying radio telescopes to eavesdrop on their targets, and they're the good guys. But their activities soon capture the interest of NYPD, specifically Homicide Detective Jocelyn Carter (Taraji P. Henson). For most of the first season, Detective Carter serves what I'd like to call the ""Jack McGee"" role. Remember that persistent reporter Jack McGee doggedly pursued the Hulk but was always a step behind? Carter becomes obsessed with catching the mysterious man in the suit who frequently thwarted crimes in progress. She'd arrive at the crime scene afterwards and offer a recurring rueful remark: ""Let me guess... tall guy in a suit.""

It's a world of dark ops, deadly conspiracies, and shadowy omniscient machines. It's a riveting techno-thriller. It's got several ongoing story arcs that are developed throughout the entire season. PERSON OF INTEREST, you are being watched...

PERSON OF INTEREST - The Complete First Season presents 23 episodes on 6 discs. The rather skimpy bonus features are:

- Original Broadcast Pilot with Executive Producer Commentary
- Extended Pilot Episode (Unaired) wih optional Executive Producer Commentary
- ""Living in an Age of Surveillance"" featurette - Experts talk about the reality and alarming sophistication of today's methods for information gathering and capability for technological surveillance (00:15:01 minutes)
- Gag Reel (00:02:44 minutes)",1356912000,7,5175,5.078823529411765
4538888,5,B0053O8ALE,"It took me a month or more of episodes, and shaking my head to jar loose old expectations, but when I opened my mind and started appreciating what I was seeing, this show blew me away.  It is far superior to most of the broadcast television shows; I cannot discuss cable or pay channels, as I do not have those.

Particularly titillating is the concept that while the machine churns out a (Social Security) number, or several related numbers, daily, it does not advise our protagonists whether the numbers are those of potential victims, potential perpetrators, or occasionally, someone who is both.  The viewer has to watch, and think.  With a lot of television these days, I listen to the TV and do something else with my eyes, but with this program, that will not work.  There are too many small clues to see, but not hear.  The writers do not spoon feed the audience.  You have to work at it.

The premise is that master computer geek and billionaire Harold Finch has created a supercomputer for the US government in the post-September 11th wave of anti-terrorism paranoia.  The supercomputer, known as The Machine, watches everyone and everything via all methods of electronic communication and surveillance.  This machine can reason.  It reports terrorist activities to the government, but the government has determined to ignore ""unimportant"" details such as plots against persons.

Mr. Finch decided to take care of that angle himself.  He hired former CIA operative John Reese to protect the persons whose numbers the machine delivers to Finch.  Reese has mad skills, but he is not perfect, nor invulnerable, and he does not always win his battles.  Sometimes the person of interest dies.  Sometimes Reese gets shot or badly hurt.  I appreciate that in the next episode, he will still be recovering from these injuries, not shiny new out of the carton again, the way television heroes have been for the fifty-odd years I've been watching.  Actions have consequences, and injuries leave scars.

Finch and Reese have enlisted the aid of a clean cop, Carter, and a dirty cop, Lionel, to get them help and information they cannot get through other means.  Those two actors are regulars.  Then there is a background of recurring characters, who make this world seem consistent:  the Mafia Don, the Fixer Lady, Finch's ex-fiance, Carter's son, Reese's CIA ex-friend, his ex-partner, and his late girl friend, and the bad guys in the Police Dept., ""HR"".

Like most action adventure shows, the hero and his side kicks escape dire situations with seconds to spare, and really should be dead any number of times, but that's par for the course.  I read somewhere that Jim Cavaziel, who portrays Reese, trained with the Navy Seals, and does know the martial arts he uses on the show.  It does look quite real.

I've also read a lot of speculation around the idea that if our government does not already have such a machine, they are working on building one.  There are already millions of cameras watching us whenever we leave our homes, and sometimes, when we are in them.  All emails are already scanned by the US government.  It is not unreasonable to suppose that all phone calls are monitored, and not just the ones to and from foreign governments, which they already admit doing.  The show posits how the world is going to be, as though it already is.  And maybe, just maybe, there is less fiction in this show than we assume.",1356825600,3,3429,4.800341296928328

Now, I do have something to note about the Ultraviolet, if you were hoping to watch that through something like a Roku or game console - I know I was, so it was a problem for me.  While there's no issue redeeming the Ultraviolet code, Person of Interest is not compatible with VUDU.  It's completely missing, so VUDU won't transfer it from your Ultraviolet account, which made watching on my TV through the PS3 impossible.  It's not really the Ultraviolet's fault though, it's VUDU, so I'm mentioning it more as a disclaimer than a problem.",1355270400,3,850,4.423076923076923

Fans of 'Enemy of the State' may see some resemblance to plot, but there is a unique enough twist to it that it serves more to enhance the plot line rather than repeat it. What ever happened to EOS anyways? We could have used a sequel or two in all of that by now! Let's hope the producers of POI can hold true and deliver on the promise of Season 1.

4539158,5,B0053O8ALE,"I've seen a lot of reviews comparing the series to 24, The Equaliser. There are definite aspects of both these shows you could see in PoI. But the writing and depth of the show is just fantastic. An entire season and not once was I thinking why are they doing that, or feeling disgust at yet another main character that was a  traitor. Jim Caviezel sounds like he is channelling Dirty Harry and is every bit as bad ****ed. The underlying mythology of the series is so well handled too. Finch and the machine. Reese and his past. The episode where yiu finally see what happened with Finches ex is pretty moving and poignant. The police interaction, the CIA all add such a level of interest it can't be beat.

I really hope the utter top tier writing continues on and doesn't get ridiculous like 24 did, where it seemed like the writers were just bent on portraying government employees and elected officials as the most despicable and traitorous bunch of critters.  I digress, but after the first seasons 24 felt like it should have been called 6x4, as the writers didn't even have a vague idea for the season arc. I admit the 24 writers took on a significant task that should have been abandoned after the first planned season. But Peeson of Interest - they have a better format and supremely good writers.

Please note that disc 4 has an extended pilot on it as an extra. I'd suggest starting with this.",1352592000,,1404,4.515748031496063

4539201,5,B0053O8ALE,I so enjoy this show. It keeps your interest. Finch and Reese work so well together. It keeps you wanting to know more about Finch and Reese. I was so glad when the DVD came out so I could watch it from the beginning. Season 2 is just as good. I hope CBS doesn't take this one off since it is so good and it doesn't have all the junk that the other shows have. It is a good clean show to watch with suspense and people helping one another.

4539205,5,B0053O8ALE,"I hadn't been watching much television for the last few years ever since ""reality t.v."" became the thing and I discovered I'd rather watch paint dry than watch ridiculous people compete to marry a total stranger and other bizarre shows that actually have next-to-nothing to do with any reality I'm aware of. Last television season, my mother happened to mention to me that she'd discovered a really good show that she thought I might like. Since I trust my mom's taste in telly, I came in on about episode 4 or 5 of Person of Interest, and I was instantly mad at myself for not knowing about this sooner. Honestly, there's nothing about this show I don't like. The show stars Michael Emerson as a reclusive genius who developed a computer program known as The Machine which the government uses to predict acts of terror. Incidentally, it can also predict violent crimes, but the government considers these crimes irrelevant if they don't pertain to national security. Haunted by the thought that he may be able to prevent crimes, he enlists the help of a former CIA agent played by one of my favorite actors, Jim Caviezel. Together these two work to investigate crimes which haven't even happened yet in the hopes they can save lives. Each episode stands alone, yet the entire season had several plot lines that carried over multiple episodes. The writing, acting, and production values of this show make it (in my humble opinion) not only the best show on television right now, but also one of the best shows ever. My husband got the season one blu-ray collection for my birthday, and we've been watching a few episodes every evening since I opened it. The blu-ray collection also has the show on dvd's so they can be watched on either type of player. There are some special features (documentary, gag reel, extended pilot) but the show is so good that those extras are truly unnecessary. If you haven't watched this show yet, you might consider buying the entire first season sight unseen because I assure you: it is THAT good!",1351987200,,2029,4.734463276836158

However, I do have a wide screen, HD television.  So I invested in these disks.  They did not disappoint.  The set includes ten disks, four Blu-ray and six DVD.  I have only watched the Blu-ray and it is glorious.  Special features include an unaired extended pilot episode (with or without commentary), a featurette on Living in an Age of Surveillance, and a very short gag reel.

4539254,5,B0053O8ALE,"Don't ask me why but I didn't get on the bandwagon in the beginning of season one. Perhaps I was too lazy to set the DVR, depending way too much on itunes to bail me out whenever I wanted. But surprise...it was never on itunes strangely enough. Eventually I ordered the season 1 DVD's and ripped them to ipad and I was instantly hooked. Just in time for season 2 which I am recording to DVR.

I love the entire concept and where they are taking the show. I thought it was refreshing to show John was able to be bested, in one episode by the MMA guy. Although the second round went to John because he didn't underestimate the guy. However, John could never stay in tip-top condition like a real SEAL unless he had continuous updated training I would think. We never see him working out...never. He only gets in fights and often has injuries.

Harold is a great departure for the actor playing him. Finally a good guy for a change, or so it seems. Maybe he should get ripped like Matthew Fox and start beating bad guys too, lol.

4539259,5,B0053O8ALE,"I was thinking when I ordered this that it would be on the same lines as Minority Report and it is NOT.  It is much, much better than I imagined.  First, James Caviezel is absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I read somewhere that he had been black-balled in Hollyweird b/c of Passion of the Christ.  So, I forget how talented he was.  One is not even aware that Caviezel's eyes guide you through his hurt, anger and care that he has for people that may take the wrong path at a fork in the road.  I don't cry when watching movies with exception Back Street w/Susan Hayward and Watership Down.  However, there were several scenes where tears would well or a couple of times - stream!!  (Tell anyone that and I'll deny it.)

But this is excellent:  Acting of all three main characters, even though it took me a while to trust the guy from LOST series.  Writing is original along with action.

I liked it!
So I want to watch it again before the 2nd episode plays.
Can't do that.
Gotta wait till next September to buy the 2nd season so I can see again.

I missed last night's episode (10/4/2012).

Ever wonder what Ben Linus was doing when he would leave the Island? Well, PoI shows you. He and Eric Roberts were fighting crime in New York, ""Quantum Leap"" style! The real cops are on their trail, but Roberts and Linus are doing the right thing...so who'll stop them? It's only a matter of time before we learn Finch's backstory and how he became Ben Linus.

4539565,4,B0053O8ALE,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Miss.

Person of Interest is a great series for conspiracy pundits, like myself. It's based on the concept that all of us are being watched.
""The government has a secret system: a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know because I built it."" said Mr. Finch.
Finch, a reclusive billionaire who has a way with computers, goes on to explain that his original intent was to detect terrorists after 9/11. But he found his program also located ordinary citizens, in trouble, who the government considered irrelevant. He decided since the bureaucracy had no interest in these people, that he would act, but he needed a partner.
That's when we meet John Reese (Jim Caviezel), a former Green Beret and CIA field officer. John has lost someone he loved, and taken to living the streets of New York as a derelict.
He's on the subway when confronted by a local gang. He takes them out, is captured on close-circuit camera and taken into the police station for questioning. Homicide Detective Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) knows there is more to this drifter than meets the eye, but before she can throughly question him, he gets out on bail.
He's freed by Mr. Finch, who explains his background and the unlikely partnership he wants to form.
John initially refuses, but realizes he may still have something to offer to society.

4539735,5,B0053O8ALE,"My comments concern plot (no spoilers).

This show takes what seems like a stereotyped theme and really plays with it, leaving the watcher never quite sure what is going to happen next. Good balance between story line and character development.

The relationships move quickly and develop, flashbacks are never quite what you expected, and the typical pattern of ""guys on the run who help people"" theme never quite gets old because the writers never fall prey to routine.

They also refused to fall prey to the ""stretching out the tension"" routine. Hidden identities and tensions are often resolved within a couple of episodes rather than stretching them out for dramatic effect. New underlying hidden story lines suddenly emerge. For example, the romantic thing in ""Castle"" has been drawn out way too far, as well as the ""death of Kate's mom"" story line. Castle got boring (took two seasons). Burn notice got boring (took three seasons). Glades got boring Took one and a half seasons).  we might like the characters, but its business as usual every episode.

But not Person of interest (so far). It keeps coming in fresh and things end at the most random and unexpected times. In a television world where stretching things out to appease the executives and  advertisers is common (remember the 4th and 5th season of Lost?)Person of Interest so far has my undivided interest.

Caviezel's and Emerson's characters are so well crafted, and the two actors play their parts exceptionally well.  There are several of Caviezel's scenes that should be Emmy material.  In fact, I'll be stunned if Person of Interest doesn't walk away with several Emmys this year.

The pacing of the program holds the viewers interest from the start until the final moments of each episode.  The classic ""red herrings"" add another degree of interest, no pun intended and, thankfully, there is just enough ""guy stuff"" like guns, fights and other action that we like, to create, what I believe, is the best series on television.  Caviezel has established himself as, in contemporary terms, a bad ass, yet one with class and compassion.  For those old enough to recall, The Equalizer, in some ways, resembles the series.

I can't wait t'll I can get the full season. Best Show Ever!! I don't know how the writers and actors do it. They carry the story and the weight of there character's personality so well.

4539882,3,B0053O8ALE,"I have stuck with this show because I'll watch anything with Michael Emerson in it, but so far it isn't very good. The writing is unbalanced, the plots are not truly fleshed out, and the characters too super-good to be likeable or realistic, like comic-book characters. The actors themselves are a pleasure to watch any time, but I wish they would be given more of a range to do their stuff -- let's see Reese crack an occasional smile that isn't sardonic, let's see more of the mental changes that Finch is going through as his understanding of Reese's method of dealing with problems grows, let's have Carter have some kind of character flaw or something to make her more human and less of a Superwoman.

The second half of this first season is miles better than the first half (which was awful), and this is why I will continue to give this show a chance. I am glad it was renewed for a second season and I am looking forward to when it returns this fall.

The show would not be the same with out any of the three main characters.  The research that Jim conducted to make his part as realistic was spot on.  True he can't give away all the secrets, however, Jim is an outstanding actor not only here but in all the movies I have watched that he was in.  He was outstanding in The Count of Monte Cristo.  THE NETWORK NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THE HIT TV SHOW THEY HAVE, AND KEEP IT.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER.  I will faithfully watch this program.
Don't want people to think I don't like Michael Emerson, not true, he comes across as a brilliant genius in most anything he sets his mind to.  He is not the kind of person that flaunts his success.
He works at businesses that he owns.  He is really quite caring also, when Mr. Reese was shot by his so called friends, Mr. Finch did not care what it cost, he dumped a pile of money to get him the best medical care.  With Finch's connections he could probably get a cavity filled.

If you have missed this - the premise is an eccentric rich geek invents and the government activates a system of cameras and listening devices that is designed to spot potential terrorists but also identifies over nefarious activities about to be enacted (a related system to the Tom Cruise hit movie Minority Report); casting of Jim Caviezel was fortunate because he adds the the unruffled, multi-skilled executioner of the show's theme of preventing wrong-doing.  The show combines plot-lines and fast-moving action but keeps the voodoo system's perspective of how clues line up to provide the show's hourly resolution.  See or buy it or both.

The surprise to me was the chemistry with Caviezel as his partner; they are funny, well-matched, and work hand in glove. Every scene with them is seamless. Their acting is at a Broadway/major film level, not television. They are amazing.

The writing is great, and becomes increasingly complex, as well as consistently intelligent. Taraji P. Henson and Kevin Chapman are also very good in their roles. This show had me within the first 20 minutes and I'm totally hooked now. I only pray that CBS takes the hint from the fact they won the People's Choice Awards for favorite new TV drama and ensures a season 2 - this show deserves a long run.",1326326400,36,819,4.7272727272727275
4540037,5,B0053O8ALE,"When I first saw the trailer for Person of Interest last summer, I couldn't wait for the first episode. I had a gut feeling this show was going to be very special. And it is...so very special. First, anything produced by J.J. Abrams is something that must be watched. Then the actors. Jim Caviezel is mesmerizing as Reese. He may not say much at times, but he can express more in his face and eyes than most actors can in words. When he spoke to the serial rapist at the end of one episode, it was gut wrenching. Then you have Michael Emerson the emmy winning actor from Lost. He is just a thrill to watch. He has inhabited his character, Harold Finch, so well that you want to grab him and say ""OK. Tell me your secrets."" And then you have Taraji Henson. She's not just a cop. She's a strong, interesting woman who has had to make some tough decisions in a man's world. And last but not least is Kevin Chapman, Det. Fusco, or ""fiasco"" as one character called him. The perfect name for a very imperfect, corrupt cop who will turn on Reese if he can get away with it. But he certainly has major problems of his own. All of these characters are so well written, amazingly complex, and wonderfully acted. This is the finest new show that has come to television in a number of years. And I'm so happy to be around to not only watch it and thoroughly enjoy it every week, but to express to everyone associated with it, congratulations!",1325980800,10,1430,4.319702602230484

Michael Emerson as the hacker guru who tracks down the Person of Interest they will try to help.  Taraji Henson as the NYC cop who is trying to figure out what these two are up to and if she should help them or arrest them. And Kevin Chapman as the corrupt cop who is spared by John (and he doesn't spare many criminals) only to be made their inside man. Great stories, great acting, great action! Imho best show on tv, except for Survivor hehe. I feel sorry for the shows writers who must sit down every week and say to themselves, ""Now how are we gonna top that episode?"" Yet they do.

4540040,5,B0053O8ALE,"I had pretty much abandoned TV, with all it's banal sit-coms and reality shows cluttering up prime time.

But I watched the POI pilot on the off chance that CBS might actually have something to offer with this scripted drama. That, and the fact that JJ Abrams was involved in its creation led me to turn to the ""idiot box"" again.

Wow! Was I glad I did! This show is terrific! It may be fiction, but the series premise is not so far from our reality (just google ""Public Surveillance Cameras"" !)

As for the story line, the two main characters, portrayed admirably by Caviezal and Emerson, form an intriguing combo...in the beginning evidencing a wary acceptance of each others skills, then over several episodes moving into mutual respect, and now seemingly morphing into a caring partnership. Writers niggardly reveal their backgrounds; every week viewers are given just a smidgen of their personal information...just enough to whet the appetite for more.

If you prefer procedural shows like CSI, Law & Order, or Bones, and consider time developing characters as a waste of film, then you may not appreciate POI. It is a scripted drama that weekly offers an interesting puzzle but concentrates on characterizations, both in the recurring roles and new ones brought into the plots.

So well done CBS! I know that you only approved a full 22 episodes because of it's ""surprisingly"" high ratings...but kudos for at least giving this show a chance to shine.

EDITED:  Not only did CBS add another episode to Season 1, for a total now of 23...the show was among the first to receive the order for a second season.  (Of course with some 14-15 million viewers for each episode CBS knew that it had a blockbuster winner in their stable!)",1324944000,12,1732,4.7885906040268456

I have watched many actors over the years looking for someone who could play Mack Bolan in a movie, but could never find one I truly liked. He not only has to maintain iron composure without being stiff or plastic; he must also be able to express compassion without seeming to be weak. Jim Caviezel IS QUINTESSENTIAL MACK BOLAN! He even favors the description of Mack Bolan. He'd have to wear blue contacts, but everything else he possesses.

4540112,5,B0053O8ALE,"Superb new mystery and action series.  Great writing, acting, directing.  Great work by producer J. J. Abrams and writer Jonathan Nolan (brother of writer/director Christopher Nolan).  Easily some of the best television currently on the air anywhere.  The vast majority of television is dreck.  Person of Interest so far isn't.

Several interesting themes: government monitoring of pretty much everyone and everything nearly everywhere.  Computerized analysis of behavior, background, etc., i.e. automated profiling of people.  Strong big brother theme which is perhaps within the realm of possibility.  A wandering samurai in a big city in the form of a former CIA case officer / special forces solider, though it's not clear how much the CIA military types typically work on HUMINT (human intelligence) and develop spies, so that may be a little off.

I would classify this as science fiction / mystery / action / thriller.  It manages to cover multiple genres well which is a rare thing indeed.

There's definitely a very strong action dimension since the hero finds the need to engage in armed and unarmed combat pretty frequently.  It's well-presented, super-violent and at the same time not really glorified, which again is unusual.  The presentation of instantaneous force is perhaps most like the samurai genre in a definite Eastern zen-like feel, but with hands and modern weapons instead of swords.

The premise and plotting are unusually strong.  I'll leave it to other reviews to describe those.  I'm definitely interesting in buying these on DVD.",1322438400,9,1559,5.272357723577236

8455365,5,B0053O8ALE,"This is a series we watched on Netflix. I really was surprised about how much I liked this show. In the past, creator J.J. Abrams has a tendency to go off the rails too much for me.

I actually thought this show was brilliant and the cast perfection.

It is the story of a man who creates a machine/computer that watches everything and everyone. The computer is designed to prevent terrorist activity a la 9/11. But, it also observes everything else and the machine develops the ability to predict when people are about to die or be in danger.

The man who invented the machine enlists others to help him to prevent bad things from happening. It is an altruistic mission that is highly complex and nuanced. Sometimes you have to let someone die so someone else can live on. Who makes that choice.

I really thought this show was smarter and more engaging than 95% of what is on American TV. You have to think about what is going on. Some of the action is a bit cartoonish, but these are really super heroes of the mind.

I loved it and will probably watch it again. It convinced me that I need to open my mind and watch Lost.

Michael Emerson and Jim Caviezel, along with Taranji P. Henson headline a stellar and talented cast. I came to have affection for every single one of them (even gangster boss Elias) in the end.

Enjoy.",1507939200,,1328,4.395918367346939
