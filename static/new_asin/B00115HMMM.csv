3060471,5,B00115HMMM,"The Girl Can't Help It was released in 1956. Starring Jayne Mansfield, Little Richard, and the Chuckles with Tony Randazzo. I saw this in the theatre. Lots of fun involving an agent turning a gangster's girlfriend into a rock 'n' roll singer.  The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw was released in 1958. Starring Jyne Mansfield. This western spoof has an Englishman heading west and becoming a legendary gunslinger by accident. Jayne saves the day. Connie Francis did her singing for her. Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter was released in 1957. Starring Jayne Mansfield. Jayne repeats on film her Broadway success. The plot has an advvertizing man falling for a movie star.

3060476,4,B00115HMMM,"Jayne Mansfield had a career that spanned over a decade. After 1960 her films were mostly B grade European releases with forgettable titles. This Set has 3 of Ms Mansfield's better 20th Century Fox titles. ""The Girl Can't Help It"" (1956), ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" (1957) & ""The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw"" (1959). ""Girl"" features Tom Ewell with many of the era's top hot entertainers & up n comers, Eddie Cochran, Julie London, Little Richard, The Platters, Gene Vincent etc. A great film. DVD also features the Jayne ""Biography"" episode as an extra. ""Rock Hunter"" has Jayne doing the role that made her a Broadway star. Tony Randall is her leading man. Movie version makes fun of the television industry where Broadway version slammed the film industry. Jayne is her wonderful ditsy persona, but Jayne & Tony are not a believable romantic couple. ""Sheriff"" was a ""western"" with Ms Jayne running a saloon & the town because there was no Sheriff! Jayne sings a few songs as well. Her voice was dubbed by Connie Francis. Jayne looks beautiful & does well with her version of a strong country woman. Not a horrible movie, but not one of her best. I think they should have put the Jayne starrer ""The Wayward Bus"" which was a great Jayne vehicle! Fox probably didn't want to include ""Bus"" because it was a b&w film, where the other two were color! Am glad to get a Jayne collection, but wish there were at least 4 films instead of the paltry 3 that were included.",1414108800,,1464,4.634615384615385

3060486,5,B00115HMMM,"I bought this collection for Sheriff of Fractured Jaw. I remember it from when I was 10 years old at the drive inn(I believe we snuck in). I like Kenneth More is this movie and also in ""Night to Remember"" (I believe both made in same year 1958). I now have both movies and to me they are classics. I looked for Sheriff of Fractured Jaw for a long time and I am glad I was able to purchase it.

I also was surprised by ""Girl can't help it'. It was enjoyable to view. I liked the early rock music in it.

3060488,5,B00115HMMM,"The Mansfield Collection is required viewing for all students of Fifties cinema and American pop culture. It contains two of Frank Tashlin's best films, one his masterwork. The odd item--barely a Mansfield film and improbably a Western shot in England--FRACTURED JAW, amazingly, was signed by the great Raoul Walsh (what was he thinking?) and is of morbid curiosity value only. The Tashlin films are another matter entirely. Available separately, here they are logically paired and actually cheaper in this Collection, at currently quoted prices. ROCK HUNTER is only a photographed stageplay and a dated one at that, yet it bears Tashlin's gently sardonic imprint and is considerably boosted by the very funny Betsy Drake and Joan Blondell as counterfoils to Miss Mansfield's supersized assets.

Tashlin is best remembered today for his work with Jerry Lewis and, less fortuitously, Doris Day. THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT is his most singular film and his masterpiece. Tashlin envisions a wacky cartoon strip storyline, colors it in an unearthly palette and then populates this artistic framework with live-action actors and entertainers, not least Miss Mansfield, Julie London (in a surreal dream/montage sequence that surely took months to shoot and edit) and contemporary (1956) popsters such as Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the Platters and the very kinetic Little Richard. And, yes, Edmond O'Brien really can rock (Miss Jayne does not rock but sways and teeters), exhibiting some radical choreography, in his too-short production number ""Rock around the rockpile,"" which must be seen to be believed. We must believe in Jayne Mansfield, for her negotiation of 90-degree turns in a tight sheath frock is a marvel of applied civil engineering. Miss Mansfield, an intelligent and astute woman, thankfully never took herself or her adopted stage persona too seriously, unlike another Fox blonde bombshell of that era.",1388707200,,1912,5.373333333333333
3060489,4,B00115HMMM,"The first Tashlin movie was not nearly as funny as Mansfield's next one: ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"", although 'Girl Can't Help It' usually gets all the accolades.  I don't know why.  'Rock Hunter' is full of dry wit and terrific supporting actors and a better plot and much better sets and outside shots.  I love it!  ""Girl Can't Help It"" was not too funny and it had alot of suddenly-loud parts that were annoying.  Check out Tony Randall and Cary Grant's squeeze, Betsy Palmer, and wonderful Betty Hutton, supporting Ms. Mansfield in ""Rock"" and you've got yourself a real midcentury laugh and a half.",1386720000,,609,4.761904761904762
3060490,4,B00115HMMM,"This film had a bunch of different types of comedy- cheesy sight gags, wacky situations, clever word play, biting satire. It takes you a little while to get into the tone and ethos of the film- America 1957 was very different- but if you just accept the values instead of questioning them, the movie is funny. A lot of the things that are shocking or boundary pushing in Mad Men are here as background or played for laughs. It was a different world.",1384905600,,449,4.421686746987952
3060491,4,B00115HMMM,"Few people have heard of Jayne Mansfield. Those that have, know her for being the mother of actress Mariska Hargitay who plays Detective Olivia Benson on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She was a major sex symbol of the 1950s, one of the original blonde bombshells, but like many others, she was more noted for her dazzling 40D-21-35 figure rather than her acting. The Pennsylvania-born beauty came to Hollywood in 1954 and bleached her dark brunette hair platinum blonde. She became the toast of Broadway with Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, which began in October 1955. Jayne's ""kos"" and ""kas"" along with her shaky walk and breathy baby talk made her an instant celebrity. She signed a six-year contract with 20th Century Fox on May 3, 1956. Executives planned to mold her as a successor to Marilyn Monroe, the studio's reigning film star, but who was on suspension at the time, after turning down several scripts.

Mansfield's first film for Fox (and the first film in this collection) is/was The Girl Can't Help It (1956) with Tom Ewell and Edmond O'Brien. In the film she played Jerri Jordan, a not-so-ditzy blonde bombshell who is forced into a career by her controlling boyfriend, Fats Murdock (O'Brien), but who falls in love with her manager, Tom Miller (Ewell). The DeLuxe colored, Cinemascope extravaganza was intended as a star vehicle for Mansfield with the subplot being a satirical parody of Rock-n-Roll music. Several then famous Rock-n-Roll and R&B singers make cameo appearances, including Julie London, Ray Anthony, Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Gene Vincent among others. The resulting film received excellent reviews and made over $9.5 million in the United States in 1956. While Mansfield's popularity grew, she had yet to succeed the star status of Marilyn Monroe, whose comeback movie Bus Stop (1956) released that same year, made over $11 million.

We next have the comedy farce Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? from 1957, which teams Ms. Mansfield with Tony Randall, Joan Blondell, Betsy Drake, and her then boyfriend (and future husband) Mickey Hargitay. It is a film version of her 1955 Broadway hit, and she reprises her role of Rita Marlowe, a self-centered film siren, who uses Rockwell ""Rock"" Hunter (Randall) as a ploy to make her boyfriend Bobo Branigansky (Hargitay) jealous and also to forget her true love, actor George Schmidlap (Groucho Marx). The film differs from the play version, being more of a parody of advertising agencies rather than a satire of Hollywood as initially intended. The film drew equally impressive reviews and made a profit of over $8 million in ticket receipts.

Lastly, we have the Western spoof The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, which was shot and released in foreign countries in 1958, but which was not released in the U.S. until 1959. This film can be called one of Mansfield's first ""loan out"" pictures. The film was shot on location in Spain and casts Mansfield as Kate, the owner of a saloon, who falls in love with gun salesman, Jonathan Tibbs (Kenneth More). While still a big production, this is the weakest installment within The Jayne Mansfield Collection in my opinion. She is not the star of the film, although she receives top billing with Kenneth More. By 1958, Fox had become disinterested in Mansfield, especially after the failure of Kiss Them for Me the previous year. Therefore, instead of spending time and money on her movies, they shipped her overseas to make European comedies and melodramas that didn't showcase her abilities as well as her earlier efforts until her contract expired in 1962.

The Jayne Mansfield Collection attempts to capture the ""phenomenon"" that was Jayne Mansfield, but it barely scratches the surface. While each film manages to entertain me, I can't help but notice how they could've been better. These films are pure camp, a bit corny to be clearer. But hey, who said Jayne Mansfield could act? She could though; just check out The Wayward Bus (1957) and Too Hot to Handle (1960), two films that could've been in this set. Though some may disagree, Mansfield was more of a celebrity than a true film star, more of an eye-catching publicity seeker than an actress. Audiences didn't buy her; and Hollywood, who adored her publicity-craving attitude in the beginning, began to loath her by the late 1950s. Jayne Mansfield did more and more risqu publicity stunts as her film career diminished, but what she didn't seem to realize was that this ""negative"" exposure was hurting her chances more than it was helping them. Her annual appearances in Playboy magazine from 1957 to 1964 didn't help much either, it just should her cheapness in a way. Around the 1956 to 1957 era, she was dubbed ""The Next Marilyn Monroe"", but by 1960, she was known as ""The Working Man's Marilyn"" and ""The Cartoon Marilyn"".

Jayne Mansfield is an icon, but more for pop culture fanatics. She is not necessarily a ""legend"", but as I've said, she's a piece of pop culture in every sense of the term. She will remain in the memory of those who like over-the-top cartoonish drama queens. She'll be remembered as a sex kitten with sex appeal that runs for miles, but also as a woman who flaunted it a bit too much. Historians will also remember her tragic death in a car crash in June 1967 at age 34. She's underrated, not as an actress, but as a symbol of the 1950s. Despite her flaws, I'd agree that Jayne Mansfield was the biggest competition to Marilyn Monroe's superstar status, although she never achieved the same level of fame as Monroe obtained during her lifetime nor has she since her demise.",1382659200,,5588,4.877894736842105

3060497,4,B00115HMMM,"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

The story opens with great promise-- a demonstration of both Cinemascope and stereo sound. Tony Randall (as himself) stands at extreme stage left and identifies ""the movie you are about to see"" as  THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT (1956) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/B000006GF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B00115A4QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>), a previous Jayne effort that starred Tom Ewell.

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

3060506,5,B00115HMMM,"There is nothing that can prepare you for the stunning performance of Jayne Mansfield as Rita Marlowe (Isn't that an exquisite Hollywwod concoction of a name??) in this utterly ridiculous movie that is totally 100% priceless as a monument to an era where people's brains must have indeed been affected by nuclear radiation.

To start off Rita's sexy squeals are a huge part of her dialogue, and her sashaying in and out of tighter, more tacky outfits than the last one seen on screen is a constant challenge to the retina. However, there is no question that this unsurpassed sex-platinum bond-atomic-bombshell always looks a vision of perfection. It is hard to think that anyone could look this amazing without pounds of silicone and thousands of surgeries, they certainly don't make them like that anymore and this is a good contemporary proof of God's existence, as ony a divinity could have sculpted a creature to look like that. Miss Mansfield has such a strong curvaceous presence that is hard to think period, while looking at her everything fades in the background except the strong presence of her poodle that sweetly matches each and everyone of her outfits with dyed hair and outfits ofhis own. Viewer be warned this is strictly a visual experience and it would have been much better as a silent film with peppy 50's music.

Tony Randall is the man that plays Hunter, a super clean and square executive that looks the type that smells like fresh listerine even at midnight. He is very energetic in his role, but too serious to provide any authentic comic relief. Mickey Hargitay  plays Bobo Branigansky, Miss Marlowe's REAL love interest, who was actually her husband in real life, looks like a male version of herself, meaning sexy, and with a great body but none of her charm and seductiveness. His claim to fame was he had been 'discovered' by Mae West and appeared in one of her acts in the early 50's, and was inmortalized in the nude in a full life-sized fresco that was painted in her home along with the other demi-gods that appeared with him in that male version of Follies. Rita's  personal assistant is Joan Blondell as Violet. This is a role that Ms. Blondell had been perfecting since she was assisting James Cagney in ""Footlight Parade"" all the way back in 1933, and she is the perfect 'tough broad' assitant and counterpart to Rita's glamorous self. Her retelling of an old love story with a milkman is a jewel of folkloric legend dimensions and she should have gotten a supporting Oscar for that monologue. Betsy Drake as Jenny Wells plays Trevor's jealous wife. She is intensily inane and vapid in her own way. At one point she resorts to squealing to gain her husband's attention and it just makes you appreciate how one small little noise could be such an asset for Mansfield and translate into a pound of lead for poor Jenny who sounds like a pig with kidney trouble. Most of her dialogue is so painful to hear I had to fast forward her scenes. She is the perfect 1950's nightmare vision of a limited, surreally dumb suburban robot that is a premonition of the Stepford Wife. If you ever feel nostalgia for this bleak cultural period in America, sit through all of her scenes and you'll snap right out of it, guaranteed.
John Williams, whom you may remember as the snob chauffeur and Audrey's father in ""Sabrina"" is stunning in his callous, momified delivery as the chief executive of Trevor's company. It is his particularly pedantic, tyrannical attitude that snaps Trevor into an advertising campaign for the company's lipstick that rolls Rita Marlowe into the story. His solidified stupidity is a monument to corporate iconography that unfortunately has not totally washed out in our time.

I suggest buying this movie rather than renting. It is too rich in detail for just one viewing and it needs to be enjoyed over and over again. It is unparalleled as a portrait of an era, and much more authentic and profound in that respect that any ferocious social commentary could have accomplished. Seeing it one can understand perfectly why the hippie generation reacted the way it did to this reality. The only surprise is that it took so long.",1249603200,,4173,4.7662517289073305

""The Girl Can't Help It"", ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" and ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"" are in this collection. All three movies are enjoyable, especially ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" in which Jayne plays a glamorous movie star named Rita Marlowe and Jayne's husband, Mickey Hargitay, plays her boyfriend. They have great chemistry in the film due to the fact they really were very much in love offscreen. ""The Girl Can't Help It"" is a sex comedy in which Jayne plays a ""dumb blonde"" who can't sing at all but somehow cuts a record deal because of her ""new sound"". The film resembles ""The Seven Year Itch"" starring Marilyn Monroe, it also stars Tom Ewell who starred in both films made within two years of each other with both ""sex symbols"" (lucky guy!) ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"" is as funny as the name of the film, in which Jayne plays a down and out inn keeper in a sleepy western cowboy town with big dreams. Her performance is tough but sweet and brazen but innocent. Jayne perfected a western accent and is a beautiful, wisecracking ""dame"". This long awaited collection of one of the most beautiful and funny women of her time is finally available! Highly recommended for all Jayne Mansfield fans and/or collectors. A great collection with a great price. You won't be disappointed!",1243987200,,1387,4.831932773109243
3060509,4,B00115HMMM,"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

The story opens with great promise-- a demonstration of both Cinemascope and stereo sound.

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

(7.1) Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957) - Tony Randall/Jayne Mansfield/Betsy Drake/Joan Blondell/John Williams/Henry Jones/Lili Gentle/Mickey Hargitay (uncredited: Groucho Marx/Majel Barrett/Barbara Eden/Benny Rubin/Minta Durfee)",1239321600,,2471,6.561349693251533
3060510,4,B00115HMMM,"The Jayne Mansfield Collection is a set of three movies featuring that beautiful, buxom and blonde movie star from the 1950s and 1960s.  I had only seen one of them before I bought the set, and having watched all three discs I can say that it was a worthwhile purchase.

The earliest film is the set is 1955's ""The Girl Can't Help It.""  This film is a gem, both for Jayne's performance (not to mention her looks) and the musical performances by a great many rock and pop singers of the time.  Tom Ewell co-stars as Tom Miller, a down-on-his-luck talent agent who's enlisted by mobster Marty ""Fats"" Murdoch (Edmond O'Brien) to make a musical star of his bride-to-be, Jerri Jordan (Ms. Mansfield) - in just six weeks time!  (Fats was once a big man in the illegal slot machine business, and he can't lower himself to marry a nobody.)

So, Tom goes out to different clubs and gets Jerri to parade around, showing off her hourglass figure to the club's owners - and they definitely pay attention! - to get her some exposure.  Along the way, we're treated to performances by the likes of Little Richard, Fats Domino, Gene Vincent, Abbey Lincoln, Ray Anthony, Eddie Fontaine, Eddie Cochrane, the Platters and more.  Perhaps the most remarkable musical treat comes to us from the beautiful Julie London, who sings her big hit ""Cry Me A River"" in a number of different outfits and locations, as Tom tries to forget his past relationship with her.

Henry Jones also co-starred in ""Girl Can't Help It"" as Fats' right hand man Mousie, but he plays a larger role in the next film, ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" - another one not to miss.  Jayne Mansfield reprises the roll she played very successfully on Broadway for the 1957 film - that of a bombshell movie star very like herself, here with the name of Rita Marlowe.  Tony Randall co-stars as Rockwell Hunter, an advertising man working on the Stay Put lipstick campaign.

When his boss (Jones) tells him that the firm may soon lose the Stay Put account, Rock dreams up the idea of getting Rita Marlowe to endorse it.  As it happens, she's in town to get away from her boyfriend, Bobo Branigansky (played by Mansfield real life husband, Mickey Hargitay) with whom she's had a fight, and decides to get even with him by pretending to be in love with the next man who happens to come to her - which happens to be Rock, trying to get her endorsement.

Mayhem of course ensues as Rock is dubbed ""Lover Doll"" and has to put up with the charade in order to get the endorement.  Mansfield and Randall play their parts very well, ably supported by Jones, John Williams as the ad agency's president and John Blondell (who gets a big scene of her own) as Rita's assistant.  There's even a very special cameo appearance at the end to play the part of Rita's one true love, Georgie Schmidlap.

It's interesting to note that references are made in this film to three other Mansfield films - ""Girl Can't Help It"" from the previous year, plus ""The Wayward Bus"" and ""Kiss Them For Me"" of the same year - with Rita Marlowe being the star of them this time!

The third film in the set is like a fish out of water compared to the two others.  While the first two are contemporary in their setting and were directed by Frank Tashlin, ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw""(1958) takes place in the Wild West and was directed by Raoul Walsh.  Kenneth More co-stars opposite Jayne as (appropriately enough) a fish out of water - or rather, an English gentleman, Jonathan Tibbs, who comes to the frontier town of Fractured Jaw to sell guns produced by his family's arms manufacturing firm.  The town has no sheriff as the previous ones have all gotten killed and understandably nobody wants the job.  When Tibbs tells the mayor (played by the wonderful Henry Hull) to just appoint somebody without taking no for an answer, the mayor decides to appoint Tibbs himself!

Jayne's character in the film is Kate, the owner of the local saloon/hotel who's a formidable woman and the closest thing the town has to a sheriff.  Looking more like Marilyn Monroe here than to herself in the other two films, Kate does take off her very conservative outfit a couple of times to appear in a couple of saucy musical numbers in the saloon.

""Sheriff"" is the weakest film in the set, but watching it was still a very amiable way to pass the time.

As for the film transfers, all are at the 2.35:1 Cinemascope ratio and are enhanced for widescreen sets.  ""Girl Can't Help It"" looks fabulous, with a sharp picture and vibrant, deep colors.  ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" is equally colorful, but to my eyes the picture looked a bit softer.  ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"" looks reasonably good, though as it was filmed on location outdoors, it can't come close to being as colorful as the other two.

The main extra feature comes on the first disc: the Biography channel program, ""Jayne Mansfield: Blonde Ambition.""  Hers was a tragic story, not just due to her untimely death at the age of 34 but because she ruined her life with drugs and alcohol.  The program traces her life from her early days as a brunette to her successes as a blonde on Broadway and in Hollywood and Las Vegas - and then to the days of cheap films and substance abuse, it all coming to an end late one night in a car crash outside New Orleans.  (All three people in the front seat were killed, but luckily her three children in the back, including current actress Mariska Hargitay, were not seriously hurt.)  Among those interviewed are her first and second husbands Paul Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay, oldest daughter Jayne Marie plus Hugh Hefner talking about Jayne's relationship with Playboy.  An interesting tidbit mentioned is that Mansfield was offered the part of Ginger, Tina Louise's character on ""Gilligan's Island"" - but she turned it down because she considered herself a film actress and television work was apparently beneath her.

The second disc also has a short Fox Movietone newsreel of Mansfield on a visit to Washington, D.C.  There are also trailers for the Jayne Mansfield Collection, and while ""Girl Can't Help It"" and ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" discs each have the trailer for the other film, the trailer for the third film in the set is for that of ""Kiss Them For Me"" (Mansfield's film with Cary Grant) and not for ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw.""  Perhaps the film with Grant was to be in the set - until someone at Fox noticed that it had already been released on DVD!  The trailer for ""Fractured Jaw"" is on the disc for that film, but oddly enough it doesn't contain any scenes from the movie - just some graphics with a soundtrack telling us how very funny this film is (or is supposed to be).

The first two films also have commentary tracks by NYU professor Toby Miller (""Girl Can't Help It"") and Dana Polan (""Rock Hunter"").  I've only listened to part of the commentary by Mr. Polan, and while it is very academic, he does give some interesting insights of how the film fit in with and commented on American society in the 1950s.

As for the package, it comes in a nice cardboard case with each film in its own standard size DVD case (unlike the Fox Horror Classics collection, which come in slimline cases).  A set of 12 black and white lobby cards, measuring 4.5 x 6 inches, are included in a separate envelope - a nice addition

All in all, the Jayne Mansfield Collection is very worth having if you're a fan of the star or of 1950s comedies.  The Biography episode is a big plus, too, and one thing I won't soon forget is the way that Mickey Hargitay became very emotional and on the verge of tears when talking about his last phone call with Jayne the night she died.  Decades later, it seems clear that he is still very much in love with her.  After seeing these films, you may be a little in love with her, too.",1211760000,,7831,4.552781740370898
3060511,4,B00115HMMM,"For those of us who live the early 50thies, this is pure nostalgia.
""The Girl Can't Help it"" give us a rare chance to see early rock and roll stars at their pics, like The platters, Little Richard, Gene Vincent and many more. Also was the era of CinemaScope and Stereophonic sound, so the Widescreen format is a must. Also the color by De-Luxe give to the new generations and idea of how was the experience of see this films in a  ""movie palace"" like those long go.
Also was the era of the television, and movie stars and producers ""hate"" the ""silly box with foggy images"" , like they called to the enemy how was taken home all the audiences. And you can feel that sentiment in ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" the second movie.
The third is a very silly movie, poor Jane, in the end, she harly made  two watchables movies. And she was th ""star"" that Fox's moguls wanted to ""erase"" Marilyn Monroe from the screen. Poor fellas, and poor Jane. In any case, this video box is a must for ll moviegoers from yeaterday and today.",1209859200,,1023,4.350785340314136

3060513,5,B00115HMMM,"Those who would dismiss Jayne Mansfield as a mere Marilyn Monroe clone would be behooved to check out this indispensible collection of her best films.  The films succeed to varying degrees but there's no disputing that Mansfield was an actress of great versatility.  Her statuesque platinum beauty may have been both a blessing and a curse but Mansfield projects warmth, intelligence, and an uncanny sense of humor.
""The Girl Can't Help It""-This is the crown jewels of the set.  My only quibble with the film is that the story intrudes at times with terrific performances by pioneering rock 'n' roll legends.  Not only doesn't director Frank Tashlin condescend to the ascendant music craze but be treats it reverently giving it the full color Cinemascope treatment.  Essential for the performances by Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and The Platters.  Fats Domino's rendition of ""Blue Monday"" is absolutely sublime.  Terrific performance by chanteuse Julie London as well.  As for the plot it's aces as well.  Tashlin's film is kind of a screwball comedy that sends up the music industry and gangster films that seems at times to be informed by his work on the Warner Brothers animated films.  Mansfield defies stereotype in her role as gangster moll without the singing ability that she's being groomed for.  Edmond O'Brien is an absolute hoot in his sendup of tough-talking gangsters.  Five stars.
""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter""-Funny but not particularly biting satire of the ad industry.  Tony Randall is engaging as the everyman adman who through a series of events becomes cause celebrae.  Mansfield, as a famous Hollywood starlet, delivers a not to veiled sendup of Monroe with middling results.  Ingenious Groucho Marx cameo.  Some chuckles but not all it could have been.  Four stars.
""The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw""-As the saloon keeper, Mansfield plays down her sexpot image somewhat, but this is really a supporting role for her.  The film's real star is Kenneth More as the British gentleman gunsmith who through a series of misunderstandings is foisted into the job of sheriff of a lawless Western town.  Though pluck or just dumb luck, the Brit succeeds.  Breezy comedy that entertains but it's best appreciated with less heightened expectations.  Four stars.",1195948800,,2288,5.146341463414634
3060514,5,B00115HMMM,"The movies Jayne Mansfield made in Hollywood are not exceptional save for one: ""The Girl Can't Help It"".  This movie , in my opinion, made her career because of the wonderful music in it----the story wasn't too bad---Tom Ewell is a so-so guy (and a VERY under-rated actor), but the treat of watching Little Richard sing ""Ready Teddy"" and the Platters, Gene Vincent, and Eddie Cochran with their songs really makes this movie a classic---to buy the set just to get this one, ---really worth it for real 50's music fans---of course, I liked all of the films in the great set----a wonderful treat.",1178928000,,594,4.711538461538462

3060519,4,B00115HMMM,"Marilyn was bigger. Mamie was a bust. Then there was Jayne. Known for her platinum hair, generous figure and limited talents, Jayne Mansfield's tragic death (in a car crash at 34 in 1967) elevated her to ""quasi legend"" level. Still, her body of work was impressive; the three flicks in this collection underscore a screen presence as brash as it was brassy. The best of the lot is The Girl Can't Help It, the 1956 film that's often called the best rock 'n roll film ever made. This spoof of musicals and gangster films boasts sparkling performances by Julie London, Ray Anthony, Abbey Lincoln, Little Richard, Fats Domino and The Platters.

""Rock Hunter"" is especially hilarious, with a wonderful Tony Randall performance. All three films are excellently remastered with crisp picture and fine color.",1162512000,,403,5.412698412698413
3060522,4,B00115HMMM,"The Girl Can't Help It is like a live-action Tex Avery cartoon - Jayne Mansfield even looks like Swingshift Cinderella herself, while Edmond O'Brien channels both Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd at times - although it's directed by another animator, Frank Tashlin, whose pen-and-ink work never quite dared to go this far. Smut is present in every scene, whether it be Mansfield holding two jugs of milk, or the outrageous milkman sight gag you cannot believe they got past the censors. The plot is a reworking of Born Yesterday but much, much funnier and a lot more likeable, with a mostly well-integrated array of rock'n'roll hits of the day from an impressive line-up of everyone from Gene Vincent to Fats Domino via Abby Lincoln and Eddie Cochrane, not to mention the mandatory Little Richard (although Barry Gordon's rendition of Blue Suede Shoes didn't make it further than the movie's trailer, included on the DVD). Yet for all the energy, perhaps the single most effective musical moment is Tom Ewell seeing old flame Julie London everywhere he turns when he hears Cry Me a River. The color is stunning in this 2.55:1 widescreen transfer, a big surprise for the usually lackluster DeLuxe color system. Perfectly joyous, and without an ounce of padding. Damn, it's catching!

(This has the best extras package of the set - an audio commentary geared more to the history of rock music than the film itself, a 43-minute Biography documentary on Mansfield and trailers.)

Yet somehow I still prefer Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? The Madison Avenue satire shares little more than a title and a character with the hit Broadway sendup of Hollywood, and it lacks the energy and jukebox construction of Girl (I mean the musical numbers, not the gal herself), but in taking on the corporate rat race rather than the music-and-gangsters milieu it seems just grounded enough for the gags to seem alternately more pertinent and more audacious. As well as being very smart, it's also unbelievably smutty, almost taking even more delight in censor-baiting than its predecessor, albeit with less milk. And in-jokes abound, whether it be Joan Blondel uttering ""Well I'll be a writer's subplot,"" a Technicolor-dyed poodle named after Girl's cinematographer Leon Shamroy or a breathtakingly audacious two-minute break in the film for the benefit of TV viewers that sees the CinemaScope screen reduced to 24 inches of rolling flickering monochrome. Sadly the 2.55:1 widescreen transfer is not as good as the previouzs laserdisc release, though still acceptable. Extras are audio commentary and trailers.

The disappointment of the set is The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, a blockbuster hit in the UK but looking like nothing so much as an undernourished Rank Organisation movie with a much bigger budget. There's a serious lack of jokes for a comedy - mostly just variations on ""He's English"" as if that automatically turns every situation into a laugh-riot - leaving it to coast by on Kenneth More's likeability, which it just about does. As the rather dull romantic interest with nothing to work with Mansfield is pretty awful, but the film does have one nice song, The Valley of Love. The 2.55:1 widescreen transfer is good, but the only extras are a novelty trailer for the film featuring no footage but unbelievably badly faked laughter from a 'real' preview audience and trailers for the other two titles.",1160438400,,3392,5.021314387211367
3060523,5,B00115HMMM,"Sadly Jayne Mansfield has been underated.  She was an intelligent and talented woman who, like Marilyn Monroe and other blonde bombshells, took over the market by playing to stereotypes.  Like Monroe, this masked what underneath was a person who had depth and the smarts to survive, at least for a while, in Hollyweird.  Unfortunately it also led to her being stereotyped and the public never had an opportunity to appreciate the real person underneath the gorgeous exterior.  This boxed set is a great collection of memorabilia about an outstanding woman and a tribute to the late 1950's.

""The Girl Can't Help It"" is one of the best rock 'n roll films made during the fifties and the various rock stars performing  make this set worth the money alone.  Jayne does an outstanding job filling a role similar to one Judy Holiday made in a more serious comedy the decade before.  A mobster hires an agent to educate her. She reveals both a beautiful and a caring heart that matches her own physical beauty.  Tom Ewell does a good job as her ""straight man"" and Edmond O'Brien actually steals the show.  It is probably O'Brien's best film.  Numbers by Julie London, Fats Domino, the Platters and others are great.  There is an interesting extra covering Jayne's life.

""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" was originally a play and one that Jayne starred in.  A young Tony Randall reveals the big star he would later become.  Jayne herself does a fantastic job playing a Marilyn Monroe type and shows a real flair for comedy.  This is largely a satire about advertising, television, and film star fandom.  Jayne's husband Mickey Hargitay has a bit part.  The ending has a special surprise for TV Land type buffs.

Jayne Mansfield really has an opportunity to break away from stereotypes in the Western, ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"".  It is a plot that has been done before, however Kenneth Moore as an Englishman who stumbles in to becoming an unwilling sheriff and Jayne as the owner of a hotel/saloon pull it off.  Plenty of action and fun, the type of thing that we miss in those old and great Western films.

They could not have grouped together a better set of films and it pays homage to a great age and a great lady.  It is a shame she died so young and did not get to see what an outstanding actress her daughter, Mariska Hargitay, would become.  Mariska won a long deserved best actress emmy for her work in ""Law and Order: SVU"" and Jayne would have been proud.  The recognition as an actress that eluded Jayne Mansfiled has been acheived by her daughter.",1160438400,,2558,4.65625
3060524,5,B00115HMMM,"I bought the set, but I don't know whether I'll get around to watching the other 2 films.  ""The Girl Can't Help It"" is undoubtedly the BEST of the early rock 'n' roll films.  Not only is it in color and CinemaScope, but it actually has a decent storyline.  (My other favorite, ""Jamboree,"" has one of the worst storylines I've ever seen, although the music is great.)

It was great to bring back the memories of seeing this film in a theater.  Some of the scenes were as I remember them, but I had actually forgotten the surprise ending.

The musical performances are GREAT, especially Little Richard, Fats Domino, Gene Vincent, The Platters, and a VERY young Eddie Cochran.  The only complaint I have is that some of the performances are interrupted by dialogue, but that is a minor problem.

As you watch this film, you can't help being jealous of Tom Ewell, who made two classic films and got the chance to act opposite screen legends Jayne Mansfield AND Marilyn Monroe!  Jayne looks simply amazing in this film!

If you watch this, be sure to check out the commentary track.  Lots of interesting background info, including Col. Tom Parker's refusal to let Elvis appear in this film because the studio wouldn't meet his asking price of $50,000.  Also look for a brief appearance by a young and THIN Phil Silvers as a milkman.  (Does anybody remember milkmen?)",1157068800,,1361,4.668067226890757
3060525,5,B00115HMMM,"Jayne Mansfield has become one of the most legendary names of 1950's cinema, ironic given many dismissed her at the time as a Marilyn Monroe clone which impeded her career (only seven major films at 20th Century-Fox and virtually everything else she was in was a low-budget ""independent"" film given scant release and attention).  Yet like the unprolific James Dean, Grace Kelly, and Mae West, Jayne Mansfield remains a legendary pop culture icon far more so than many stars with 60 or more motion pictures to their credit.  I think it's because like Dean, Kelly, and West, Jayne Mansfield hit the bullseye in a few pictures and it was enough to cement her legend.  Both of Mansfield's bell-ringers, THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT and WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER, are on this collection with the  added treat of a good little comedy-western THE SHERIFF OF FRACTURED JAW.

THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT - Jayne stars with Tom Ewell (Monroe's comic leading man in THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH) in this comedy with music about a record promoter hired by a gangster to promote his talentless mistress into a pop singer.  The three leading roles seem perilously close to those from BORN YESTERDAY but with it's three distinctive performers (Edmond O'Brien being the third) it's not that noticable. Jayne plays the girl (duh!!!) who despite her figure resembling a Playboy cartoon really wants to be nothing but a home-loving wife (""Nobody thinks I'm equipped for motherhood"" she sighs, as her double D's practically pop out of her dress.) Director Frank Tashlin was a former cartoonist and the movie resembles an animated picture with outrageous sight gags and wacky humor.  And the movie is loaded with music numbers that ""expresses the culture, the refinement,  and polite grace of the present day"" - rock n' roll, baby!! Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Platters, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and others making rare appearances in a major motion picture.  GIRL is frequently mentioned as a candidate for the greatest rock n'roll movie of alltime for it's amazing musical performances and with the superb comedy work of Mansfield, Ewell, and O'Brien, you could hardly ask for more.

WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER - This 1957 satire has an astonishing sharp bite more than 40 years after it's initial release! The movie is loaded with sharp barbs on America's obssession with sexy blondes, big breasts, ""personality"" movie stars who want to be pretentious dramatic ones, two celebrities in ""love"" who have their every move covered by the press, ordinary citizens turned into media celebrities (or ""reality stars"" as we call them now), and television and commercials everywhere you turn makes you wonder if we've really changed at all in 50 years.

Jayne's delicious perfomrmance here is as good as any of Marilyn Monroe and Jean Harlow's best comic work. And she is definately an original.  Despite the Monroe comparsions, it's hard to imagine Marilyn playing the spirited heroines of GIRL and ROCK, Jayne is maybe closer to an inflated Debbie Reynolds.

I did find Tony Randall a little unappealing, a movie leading man he ain't, even when playing a blah sort who gets hyped into stardom. All through the picture I kept thinking how awesome Jack Lemmon would have been in this role. Randall's not bad though and he doesn't hurt the picture. But he does make our Jaynie work overtime keeping the film lively.

Joan Blondell is enjoyable in one of her early films as a character actress, having been quite a sexy blonde lead herself in the 1930's and 1940's. Betsy Drake (best known as one of Cary Grant's wives) is an appealing ingenue sort as the real girlfriend of ""Lover Doll"" Randall who must stand by and watch the media promote Jayne and Tony as one of the great love stories of the era. The movie is hilarious from the opening credits to the final minute - but above all, this is a perfect showcase for the special talents of Miss Jayne Mansfield!!

SHERIFF OF FRACTURED JAW - directed by the great Raoul Walsh, this color comic western casts Jayne as a saloon owner who helps Englishman Kenneth More adapt to life in the Old West and his new position as sheriff.  More is fairly forgotten today but in the 1950's he was considered a potential heir to Laurence Oliver's throne as England's leading actor so being cast opposite him was rather prestigious for Jayne, who tones down her sex kitten act (although those tight period dresses make her look maybe  bustier than ever even if there is no hint of clevage.) This is the sort of pleasant, somewhat unmemorable movie many stars make over and over.  This 1959 release unexpectedly proved the end of Jayne's glory days in Hollywood, although she would remained famous until her death in 1967 and was considered a big star at least until 1962.  She was sadly wasted in scores of ""B"" and ""D"" films in the 1960's but she likely will always remain a legend due to her pair of beauties - THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT and WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER.",1155945600,,4974,4.796491228070176
3060526,4,B00115HMMM,"I am a die-hard, dyed in the wool Jayne Mansfield fan. I am completely delighted that there is finally a Jayne set out. Despite the often simple comparison to Marilyn Monroe, Jayne was a different kind of ""dumb blonde"". Jayne had a screen energy and luminosity that could captivate a person. She was a comedic talent that, unfortunately was not allowed to shine as much as it should have.

This collection is nice. A lot of Mansfield fans have been waiting for ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?""  and ""The Girl Can't Help It"" to be realeased on DVD. The one disappointment is the missing movies. Jayne's career included some, albeit, low budget and explotation films, but her career could be better represented. This set would have been more complete with the addition of ""Kiss Them For Me"", ""The Wayward Bus"" and ""It Happened in Athens"". At least that would logically keep on track with her career and offer the viewer a better sampling of her tantalizing, fabulous persona. Unfortunately, this set does limit her as an actress, just has Hollywood did. But Jayne is a treat, in any size portion!",1155427200,,1095,4.757894736842105

of Marilyn Monroe, her films are highly entertaining, campy and great fun.
I am not familiar with The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw, but I rate
Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (with Tony Randall) as a little gem of a Cinemascope,
Technicolor comedy. As she does in all her films, Jayne plays
a highly exaggerated parody of Monroe, but brings her own brand of humor
and sweetness to her roles. The Girl Can't Help It (also Technicolor and Cinemascope) has a big bonus because it features some legendary music stars of the 1950s: Fats Domino, The Platters, Gene Vincent and Little Richard. This one's a must for fans of early Rock 'n Roll. I forgot to mention that sultry Julie London sings her huge pop hit, ""Cry Me A River"".

This Set has 3 of Ms Mansfield's better 20th Century Fox titles. ""The Girl Can't Help It"" (1956), ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" (1957) & ""The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw"" (1959). ""Girl"" features Tom Ewell with many of the era's top hot entertainers & up n comers, Eddie Cochran, Julie London, Little Richard, The Platters, Gene Vincent etc. A great film. DVD also features the Jayne ""Biography"" episode as an extra. ""Rock Hunter"" has Jayne doing the role that made her a Broadway star. Tony Randall is her leading man. Movie version makes fun of the television industry where Broadway version slammed the film industry. Jayne is her wonderful ditsy persona, but Jayne & Tony are not a believable romantic couple. ""Sheriff"" was a ""western"" with Ms Jayne running a saloon & the town because there was no Sheriff! Jayne sings a few songs as well. Her voice was dubbed by Connie Francis. Jayne looks beautiful & does well with her version of a strong country woman. Not a horrible movie, but not one of her best. I think they should have put the Jayne starrer ""The Wayward Bus"" which was a great Jayne vehicle! Fox probably didn't want to include ""Bus"" because it was a b&w film, where the other two were color!

3294985,5,B00115HMMM,"The Mansfield Collection is required viewing for all students of Fifties cinema and American pop culture. It contains two of Frank Tashlin's best films, one his masterwork. The odd item--barely a Mansfield film and improbably a Western shot in England--FRACTURED JAW, amazingly, was signed by the great Raoul Walsh (what was he thinking?) and is of morbid curiosity value only. The Tashlin films are another matter entirely. Available separately, here they are logically paired and actually cheaper in this Collection, at currently quoted prices. ROCK HUNTER is only a photographed stageplay and a dated one at that, yet it bears Tashlin's gently sardonic imprint and is considerably boosted by the very funny Betsy Drake and Joan Blondell as counterfoils to Miss Mansfield's supersized assets.

Tashlin is best remembered today for his work with Jerry Lewis and, less fortuitously, Doris Day. THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT is his most singular film and his masterpiece. Tashlin envisions a wacky cartoon strip storyline, colors it in an unearthly palette and then populates this artistic framework with live-action actors and entertainers, not least Miss Mansfield, Julie London (in a surreal dream/montage sequence that surely took months to shoot and edit) and contemporary (1956) popsters such as Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the Platters and the very kinetic Little Richard. And, yes, Edmond O'Brien really can rock (Miss Jayne does not rock but sways and teeters), exhibiting some radical choreography, in his too-short production number ""Rock around the rockpile,"" which must be seen to be believed. We must believe in Jayne Mansfield, for her negotiation of 90-degree turns in a tight sheath frock is a marvel of applied civil engineering. Miss Mansfield, an intelligent and astute woman, thankfully never took herself or her adopted stage persona too seriously, unlike another Fox blonde bombshell of that era.",1388707200,,1912,5.373333333333333
3294986,4,B00115HMMM,"The first Tashlin movie was not nearly as funny as Mansfield's next one: ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"", although 'Girl Can't Help It' usually gets all the accolades.  I don't know why.  'Rock Hunter' is full of dry wit and terrific supporting actors and a better plot and much better sets and outside shots.  I love it!  ""Girl Can't Help It"" was not too funny and it had alot of suddenly-loud parts that were annoying.  Check out Tony Randall and Cary Grant's squeeze, Betsy Palmer, and wonderful Betty Hutton, supporting Ms. Mansfield in ""Rock"" and you've got yourself a real midcentury laugh and a half.",1386720000,,609,4.761904761904762

A lot of the things that are shocking or boundary pushing in Mad Men are here as background or played for laughs. It was a different world.",1384905600,,449,4.421686746987952
3294988,4,B00115HMMM,"Few people have heard of Jayne Mansfield. Those that have, know her for being the mother of actress Mariska Hargitay who plays Detective Olivia Benson on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She was a major sex symbol of the 1950s, one of the original blonde bombshells, but like many others, she was more noted for her dazzling 40D-21-35 figure rather than her acting. The Pennsylvania-born beauty came to Hollywood in 1954 and bleached her dark brunette hair platinum blonde. She became the toast of Broadway with Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, which began in October 1955. Jayne's ""kos"" and ""kas"" along with her shaky walk and breathy baby talk made her an instant celebrity. She signed a six-year contract with 20th Century Fox on May 3, 1956. Executives planned to mold her as a successor to Marilyn Monroe, the studio's reigning film star, but who was on suspension at the time, after turning down several scripts.

Mansfield's first film for Fox (and the first film in this collection) is/was The Girl Can't Help It (1956) with Tom Ewell and Edmond O'Brien. In the film she played Jerri Jordan, a not-so-ditzy blonde bombshell who is forced into a career by her controlling boyfriend, Fats Murdock (O'Brien), but who falls in love with her manager, Tom Miller (Ewell). The DeLuxe colored, Cinemascope extravaganza was intended as a star vehicle for Mansfield with the subplot being a satirical parody of Rock-n-Roll music. Several then famous Rock-n-Roll and R&B singers make cameo appearances, including Julie London, Ray Anthony, Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Gene Vincent among others. The resulting film received excellent reviews and made over $9.5 million in the United States in 1956. While Mansfield's popularity grew, she had yet to succeed the star status of Marilyn Monroe, whose comeback movie Bus Stop (1956) released that same year, made over $11 million.

We next have the comedy farce Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? from 1957, which teams Ms. Mansfield with Tony Randall, Joan Blondell, Betsy Drake, and her then boyfriend (and future husband) Mickey Hargitay. It is a film version of her 1955 Broadway hit, and she reprises her role of Rita Marlowe, a self-centered film siren, who uses Rockwell ""Rock"" Hunter (Randall) as a ploy to make her boyfriend Bobo Branigansky (Hargitay) jealous and also to forget her true love, actor George Schmidlap (Groucho Marx). The film differs from the play version, being more of a parody of advertising agencies rather than a satire of Hollywood as initially intended. The film drew equally impressive reviews and made a profit of over $8 million in ticket receipts.

Lastly, we have the Western spoof The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, which was shot and released in foreign countries in 1958, but which was not released in the U.S. until 1959. This film can be called one of Mansfield's first ""loan out"" pictures. The film was shot on location in Spain and casts Mansfield as Kate, the owner of a saloon, who falls in love with gun salesman, Jonathan Tibbs (Kenneth More). While still a big production, this is the weakest installment within The Jayne Mansfield Collection in my opinion. She is not the star of the film, although she receives top billing with Kenneth More. By 1958, Fox had become disinterested in Mansfield, especially after the failure of Kiss Them for Me the previous year. Therefore, instead of spending time and money on her movies, they shipped her overseas to make European comedies and melodramas that didn't showcase her abilities as well as her earlier efforts until her contract expired in 1962.

The Jayne Mansfield Collection attempts to capture the ""phenomenon"" that was Jayne Mansfield, but it barely scratches the surface. While each film manages to entertain me, I can't help but notice how they could've been better. These films are pure camp, a bit corny to be clearer. But hey, who said Jayne Mansfield could act? She could though; just check out The Wayward Bus (1957) and Too Hot to Handle (1960), two films that could've been in this set. Though some may disagree, Mansfield was more of a celebrity than a true film star, more of an eye-catching publicity seeker than an actress. Audiences didn't buy her; and Hollywood, who adored her publicity-craving attitude in the beginning, began to loath her by the late 1950s. Jayne Mansfield did more and more risqu publicity stunts as her film career diminished, but what she didn't seem to realize was that this ""negative"" exposure was hurting her chances more than it was helping them. Her annual appearances in Playboy magazine from 1957 to 1964 didn't help much either, it just should her cheapness in a way. Around the 1956 to 1957 era, she was dubbed ""The Next Marilyn Monroe"", but by 1960, she was known as ""The Working Man's Marilyn"" and ""The Cartoon Marilyn"".

Jayne Mansfield is an icon, but more for pop culture fanatics. She is not necessarily a ""legend"", but as I've said, she's a piece of pop culture in every sense of the term. She will remain in the memory of those who like over-the-top cartoonish drama queens. She'll be remembered as a sex kitten with sex appeal that runs for miles, but also as a woman who flaunted it a bit too much. Historians will also remember her tragic death in a car crash in June 1967 at age 34. She's underrated, not as an actress, but as a symbol of the 1950s. Despite her flaws, I'd agree that Jayne Mansfield was the biggest competition to Marilyn Monroe's superstar status, although she never achieved the same level of fame as Monroe obtained during her lifetime nor has she since her demise.",1382659200,,5588,4.877894736842105

3294994,4,B00115HMMM,"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

The story opens with great promise-- a demonstration of both Cinemascope and stereo sound. Tony Randall (as himself) stands at extreme stage left and identifies ""the movie you are about to see"" as  THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT (1956) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/B000006GF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B00115A4QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>), a previous Jayne effort that starred Tom Ewell.

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

Rockwell P. Hunter (Tony Randall) comes up with a plan to save the company he works for (Stayput Lipstick) from going down the tubes, by using a well known movie star that is noted for her kiss, to indorse the product.

The movie star (Jayne Mansfield) has plans of her own with will eventually propel Rock in to the limelight from there he may even advance n the company and become a success. And we all know what the big question is.

3295003,5,B00115HMMM,"There is nothing that can prepare you for the stunning performance of Jayne Mansfield as Rita Marlowe (Isn't that an exquisite Hollywwod concoction of a name??) in this utterly ridiculous movie that is totally 100% priceless as a monument to an era where people's brains must have indeed been affected by nuclear radiation.

To start off Rita's sexy squeals are a huge part of her dialogue, and her sashaying in and out of tighter, more tacky outfits than the last one seen on screen is a constant challenge to the retina. However, there is no question that this unsurpassed sex-platinum bond-atomic-bombshell always looks a vision of perfection. It is hard to think that anyone could look this amazing without pounds of silicone and thousands of surgeries, they certainly don't make them like that anymore and this is a good contemporary proof of God's existence, as ony a divinity could have sculpted a creature to look like that. Miss Mansfield has such a strong curvaceous presence that is hard to think period, while looking at her everything fades in the background except the strong presence of her poodle that sweetly matches each and everyone of her outfits with dyed hair and outfits ofhis own. Viewer be warned this is strictly a visual experience and it would have been much better as a silent film with peppy 50's music.

Tony Randall is the man that plays Hunter, a super clean and square executive that looks the type that smells like fresh listerine even at midnight. He is very energetic in his role, but too serious to provide any authentic comic relief. Mickey Hargitay  plays Bobo Branigansky, Miss Marlowe's REAL love interest, who was actually her husband in real life, looks like a male version of herself, meaning sexy, and with a great body but none of her charm and seductiveness. His claim to fame was he had been 'discovered' by Mae West and appeared in one of her acts in the early 50's, and was inmortalized in the nude in a full life-sized fresco that was painted in her home along with the other demi-gods that appeared with him in that male version of Follies. Rita's  personal assistant is Joan Blondell as Violet. This is a role that Ms. Blondell had been perfecting since she was assisting James Cagney in ""Footlight Parade"" all the way back in 1933, and she is the perfect 'tough broad' assitant and counterpart to Rita's glamorous self. Her retelling of an old love story with a milkman is a jewel of folkloric legend dimensions and she should have gotten a supporting Oscar for that monologue. Betsy Drake as Jenny Wells plays Trevor's jealous wife. She is intensily inane and vapid in her own way. At one point she resorts to squealing to gain her husband's attention and it just makes you appreciate how one small little noise could be such an asset for Mansfield and translate into a pound of lead for poor Jenny who sounds like a pig with kidney trouble. Most of her dialogue is so painful to hear I had to fast forward her scenes. She is the perfect 1950's nightmare vision of a limited, surreally dumb suburban robot that is a premonition of the Stepford Wife. If you ever feel nostalgia for this bleak cultural period in America, sit through all of her scenes and you'll snap right out of it, guaranteed.
John Williams, whom you may remember as the snob chauffeur and Audrey's father in ""Sabrina"" is stunning in his callous, momified delivery as the chief executive of Trevor's company. It is his particularly pedantic, tyrannical attitude that snaps Trevor into an advertising campaign for the company's lipstick that rolls Rita Marlowe into the story. His solidified stupidity is a monument to corporate iconography that unfortunately has not totally washed out in our time.

I suggest buying this movie rather than renting. It is too rich in detail for just one viewing and it needs to be enjoyed over and over again. It is unparalleled as a portrait of an era, and much more authentic and profound in that respect that any ferocious social commentary could have accomplished. Seeing it one can understand perfectly why the hippie generation reacted the way it did to this reality. The only surprise is that it took so long.",1249603200,,4173,4.7662517289073305

""The Girl Can't Help It"", ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" and ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"" are in this collection. All three movies are enjoyable, especially ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" in which Jayne plays a glamorous movie star named Rita Marlowe and Jayne's husband, Mickey Hargitay, plays her boyfriend. They have great chemistry in the film due to the fact they really were very much in love offscreen. ""The Girl Can't Help It"" is a sex comedy in which Jayne plays a ""dumb blonde"" who can't sing at all but somehow cuts a record deal because of her ""new sound"". The film resembles ""The Seven Year Itch"" starring Marilyn Monroe, it also stars Tom Ewell who starred in both films made within two years of each other with both ""sex symbols"" (lucky guy!) ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"" is as funny as the name of the film, in which Jayne plays a down and out inn keeper in a sleepy western cowboy town with big dreams. Her performance is tough but sweet and brazen but innocent. Jayne perfected a western accent and is a beautiful, wisecracking ""dame"".

3295006,4,B00115HMMM,"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

The story opens with great promise-- a demonstration of both Cinemascope and stereo sound.

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

(7.1) Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957) - Tony Randall/Jayne Mansfield/Betsy Drake/Joan Blondell/John Williams/Henry Jones/Lili Gentle/Mickey Hargitay (uncredited: Groucho Marx/Majel Barrett/Barbara Eden/Benny Rubin/Minta Durfee)",1239321600,,2471,6.561349693251533
3295007,4,B00115HMMM,"The Jayne Mansfield Collection is a set of three movies featuring that beautiful, buxom and blonde movie star from the 1950s and 1960s.  I had only seen one of them before I bought the set, and having watched all three discs I can say that it was a worthwhile purchase.

The earliest film is the set is 1955's ""The Girl Can't Help It.""  This film is a gem, both for Jayne's performance (not to mention her looks) and the musical performances by a great many rock and pop singers of the time.  Tom Ewell co-stars as Tom Miller, a down-on-his-luck talent agent who's enlisted by mobster Marty ""Fats"" Murdoch (Edmond O'Brien) to make a musical star of his bride-to-be, Jerri Jordan (Ms. Mansfield) - in just six weeks time!  (Fats was once a big man in the illegal slot machine business, and he can't lower himself to marry a nobody.)

So, Tom goes out to different clubs and gets Jerri to parade around, showing off her hourglass figure to the club's owners - and they definitely pay attention! - to get her some exposure.  Along the way, we're treated to performances by the likes of Little Richard, Fats Domino, Gene Vincent, Abbey Lincoln, Ray Anthony, Eddie Fontaine, Eddie Cochrane, the Platters and more.  Perhaps the most remarkable musical treat comes to us from the beautiful Julie London, who sings her big hit ""Cry Me A River"" in a number of different outfits and locations, as Tom tries to forget his past relationship with her.

Henry Jones also co-starred in ""Girl Can't Help It"" as Fats' right hand man Mousie, but he plays a larger role in the next film, ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" - another one not to miss.  Jayne Mansfield reprises the roll she played very successfully on Broadway for the 1957 film - that of a bombshell movie star very like herself, here with the name of Rita Marlowe.  Tony Randall co-stars as Rockwell Hunter, an advertising man working on the Stay Put lipstick campaign.

When his boss (Jones) tells him that the firm may soon lose the Stay Put account, Rock dreams up the idea of getting Rita Marlowe to endorse it.  As it happens, she's in town to get away from her boyfriend, Bobo Branigansky (played by Mansfield real life husband, Mickey Hargitay) with whom she's had a fight, and decides to get even with him by pretending to be in love with the next man who happens to come to her - which happens to be Rock, trying to get her endorsement.

Mayhem of course ensues as Rock is dubbed ""Lover Doll"" and has to put up with the charade in order to get the endorement.  Mansfield and Randall play their parts very well, ably supported by Jones, John Williams as the ad agency's president and John Blondell (who gets a big scene of her own) as Rita's assistant.  There's even a very special cameo appearance at the end to play the part of Rita's one true love, Georgie Schmidlap.

It's interesting to note that references are made in this film to three other Mansfield films - ""Girl Can't Help It"" from the previous year, plus ""The Wayward Bus"" and ""Kiss Them For Me"" of the same year - with Rita Marlowe being the star of them this time!

The third film in the set is like a fish out of water compared to the two others.  While the first two are contemporary in their setting and were directed by Frank Tashlin, ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw""(1958) takes place in the Wild West and was directed by Raoul Walsh.  Kenneth More co-stars opposite Jayne as (appropriately enough) a fish out of water - or rather, an English gentleman, Jonathan Tibbs, who comes to the frontier town of Fractured Jaw to sell guns produced by his family's arms manufacturing firm.  The town has no sheriff as the previous ones have all gotten killed and understandably nobody wants the job.  When Tibbs tells the mayor (played by the wonderful Henry Hull) to just appoint somebody without taking no for an answer, the mayor decides to appoint Tibbs himself!

Jayne's character in the film is Kate, the owner of the local saloon/hotel who's a formidable woman and the closest thing the town has to a sheriff.  Looking more like Marilyn Monroe here than to herself in the other two films, Kate does take off her very conservative outfit a couple of times to appear in a couple of saucy musical numbers in the saloon.

""Sheriff"" is the weakest film in the set, but watching it was still a very amiable way to pass the time.

As for the film transfers, all are at the 2.35:1 Cinemascope ratio and are enhanced for widescreen sets.  ""Girl Can't Help It"" looks fabulous, with a sharp picture and vibrant, deep colors.  ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" is equally colorful, but to my eyes the picture looked a bit softer.  ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"" looks reasonably good, though as it was filmed on location outdoors, it can't come close to being as colorful as the other two.

The main extra feature comes on the first disc: the Biography channel program, ""Jayne Mansfield: Blonde Ambition.""  Hers was a tragic story, not just due to her untimely death at the age of 34 but because she ruined her life with drugs and alcohol.  The program traces her life from her early days as a brunette to her successes as a blonde on Broadway and in Hollywood and Las Vegas - and then to the days of cheap films and substance abuse, it all coming to an end late one night in a car crash outside New Orleans.  (All three people in the front seat were killed, but luckily her three children in the back, including current actress Mariska Hargitay, were not seriously hurt.)  Among those interviewed are her first and second husbands Paul Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay, oldest daughter Jayne Marie plus Hugh Hefner talking about Jayne's relationship with Playboy.  An interesting tidbit mentioned is that Mansfield was offered the part of Ginger, Tina Louise's character on ""Gilligan's Island"" - but she turned it down because she considered herself a film actress and television work was apparently beneath her.

The second disc also has a short Fox Movietone newsreel of Mansfield on a visit to Washington, D.C.  There are also trailers for the Jayne Mansfield Collection, and while ""Girl Can't Help It"" and ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" discs each have the trailer for the other film, the trailer for the third film in the set is for that of ""Kiss Them For Me"" (Mansfield's film with Cary Grant) and not for ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw.""  Perhaps the film with Grant was to be in the set - until someone at Fox noticed that it had already been released on DVD!  The trailer for ""Fractured Jaw"" is on the disc for that film, but oddly enough it doesn't contain any scenes from the movie - just some graphics with a soundtrack telling us how very funny this film is (or is supposed to be).

The first two films also have commentary tracks by NYU professor Toby Miller (""Girl Can't Help It"") and Dana Polan (""Rock Hunter"").  I've only listened to part of the commentary by Mr. Polan, and while it is very academic, he does give some interesting insights of how the film fit in with and commented on American society in the 1950s.

As for the package, it comes in a nice cardboard case with each film in its own standard size DVD case (unlike the Fox Horror Classics collection, which come in slimline cases).  A set of 12 black and white lobby cards, measuring 4.5 x 6 inches, are included in a separate envelope - a nice addition

All in all, the Jayne Mansfield Collection is very worth having if you're a fan of the star or of 1950s comedies.  The Biography episode is a big plus, too, and one thing I won't soon forget is the way that Mickey Hargitay became very emotional and on the verge of tears when talking about his last phone call with Jayne the night she died.  Decades later, it seems clear that he is still very much in love with her.  After seeing these films, you may be a little in love with her, too.",1211760000,,7831,4.552781740370898
3295008,4,B00115HMMM,"For those of us who live the early 50thies, this is pure nostalgia.
""The Girl Can't Help it"" give us a rare chance to see early rock and roll stars at their pics, like The platters, Little Richard, Gene Vincent and many more. Also was the era of CinemaScope and Stereophonic sound, so the Widescreen format is a must. Also the color by De-Luxe give to the new generations and idea of how was the experience of see this films in a  ""movie palace"" like those long go.
Also was the era of the television, and movie stars and producers ""hate"" the ""silly box with foggy images"" , like they called to the enemy how was taken home all the audiences. And you can feel that sentiment in ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" the second movie.
The third is a very silly movie, poor Jane, in the end, she harly made  two watchables movies. And she was th ""star"" that Fox's moguls wanted to ""erase"" Marilyn Monroe from the screen.

3295010,5,B00115HMMM,"Those who would dismiss Jayne Mansfield as a mere Marilyn Monroe clone would be behooved to check out this indispensible collection of her best films.  The films succeed to varying degrees but there's no disputing that Mansfield was an actress of great versatility.  Her statuesque platinum beauty may have been both a blessing and a curse but Mansfield projects warmth, intelligence, and an uncanny sense of humor.
""The Girl Can't Help It""-This is the crown jewels of the set.  My only quibble with the film is that the story intrudes at times with terrific performances by pioneering rock 'n' roll legends.  Not only doesn't director Frank Tashlin condescend to the ascendant music craze but be treats it reverently giving it the full color Cinemascope treatment.  Essential for the performances by Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and The Platters.  Fats Domino's rendition of ""Blue Monday"" is absolutely sublime.  Terrific performance by chanteuse Julie London as well.  As for the plot it's aces as well.  Tashlin's film is kind of a screwball comedy that sends up the music industry and gangster films that seems at times to be informed by his work on the Warner Brothers animated films.  Mansfield defies stereotype in her role as gangster moll without the singing ability that she's being groomed for.  Edmond O'Brien is an absolute hoot in his sendup of tough-talking gangsters.  Five stars.
""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter""-Funny but not particularly biting satire of the ad industry.  Tony Randall is engaging as the everyman adman who through a series of events becomes cause celebrae.  Mansfield, as a famous Hollywood starlet, delivers a not to veiled sendup of Monroe with middling results.  Ingenious Groucho Marx cameo.  Some chuckles but not all it could have been.  Four stars.
""The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw""-As the saloon keeper, Mansfield plays down her sexpot image somewhat, but this is really a supporting role for her.  The film's real star is Kenneth More as the British gentleman gunsmith who through a series of misunderstandings is foisted into the job of sheriff of a lawless Western town.  Though pluck or just dumb luck, the Brit succeeds.  Breezy comedy that entertains but it's best appreciated with less heightened expectations.  Four stars.",1195948800,,2288,5.146341463414634

Known for her platinum hair, generous figure and limited talents, Jayne Mansfield's tragic death (in a car crash at 34 in 1967) elevated her to ""quasi legend"" level. Still, her body of work was impressive; the three flicks in this collection underscore a screen presence as brash as it was brassy. The best of the lot is The Girl Can't Help It, the 1956 film that's often called the best rock 'n roll film ever made.

3295019,4,B00115HMMM,"The Girl Can't Help It is like a live-action Tex Avery cartoon - Jayne Mansfield even looks like Swingshift Cinderella herself, while Edmond O'Brien channels both Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd at times - although it's directed by another animator, Frank Tashlin, whose pen-and-ink work never quite dared to go this far. Smut is present in every scene, whether it be Mansfield holding two jugs of milk, or the outrageous milkman sight gag you cannot believe they got past the censors. The plot is a reworking of Born Yesterday but much, much funnier and a lot more likeable, with a mostly well-integrated array of rock'n'roll hits of the day from an impressive line-up of everyone from Gene Vincent to Fats Domino via Abby Lincoln and Eddie Cochrane, not to mention the mandatory Little Richard (although Barry Gordon's rendition of Blue Suede Shoes didn't make it further than the movie's trailer, included on the DVD). Yet for all the energy, perhaps the single most effective musical moment is Tom Ewell seeing old flame Julie London everywhere he turns when he hears Cry Me a River. The color is stunning in this 2.55:1 widescreen transfer, a big surprise for the usually lackluster DeLuxe color system. Perfectly joyous, and without an ounce of padding. Damn, it's catching!

(This has the best extras package of the set - an audio commentary geared more to the history of rock music than the film itself, a 43-minute Biography documentary on Mansfield and trailers.)

Yet somehow I still prefer Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? The Madison Avenue satire shares little more than a title and a character with the hit Broadway sendup of Hollywood, and it lacks the energy and jukebox construction of Girl (I mean the musical numbers, not the gal herself), but in taking on the corporate rat race rather than the music-and-gangsters milieu it seems just grounded enough for the gags to seem alternately more pertinent and more audacious. As well as being very smart, it's also unbelievably smutty, almost taking even more delight in censor-baiting than its predecessor, albeit with less milk. And in-jokes abound, whether it be Joan Blondel uttering ""Well I'll be a writer's subplot,"" a Technicolor-dyed poodle named after Girl's cinematographer Leon Shamroy or a breathtakingly audacious two-minute break in the film for the benefit of TV viewers that sees the CinemaScope screen reduced to 24 inches of rolling flickering monochrome. Sadly the 2.55:1 widescreen transfer is not as good as the previouzs laserdisc release, though still acceptable. Extras are audio commentary and trailers.

The disappointment of the set is The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, a blockbuster hit in the UK but looking like nothing so much as an undernourished Rank Organisation movie with a much bigger budget. There's a serious lack of jokes for a comedy - mostly just variations on ""He's English"" as if that automatically turns every situation into a laugh-riot - leaving it to coast by on Kenneth More's likeability, which it just about does. As the rather dull romantic interest with nothing to work with Mansfield is pretty awful, but the film does have one nice song, The Valley of Love. The 2.55:1 widescreen transfer is good, but the only extras are a novelty trailer for the film featuring no footage but unbelievably badly faked laughter from a 'real' preview audience and trailers for the other two titles.",1160438400,,3392,5.021314387211367
3295020,5,B00115HMMM,"Sadly Jayne Mansfield has been underated.  She was an intelligent and talented woman who, like Marilyn Monroe and other blonde bombshells, took over the market by playing to stereotypes.  Like Monroe, this masked what underneath was a person who had depth and the smarts to survive, at least for a while, in Hollyweird.  Unfortunately it also led to her being stereotyped and the public never had an opportunity to appreciate the real person underneath the gorgeous exterior.  This boxed set is a great collection of memorabilia about an outstanding woman and a tribute to the late 1950's.

""The Girl Can't Help It"" is one of the best rock 'n roll films made during the fifties and the various rock stars performing  make this set worth the money alone.  Jayne does an outstanding job filling a role similar to one Judy Holiday made in a more serious comedy the decade before.  A mobster hires an agent to educate her. She reveals both a beautiful and a caring heart that matches her own physical beauty.  Tom Ewell does a good job as her ""straight man"" and Edmond O'Brien actually steals the show.  It is probably O'Brien's best film.  Numbers by Julie London, Fats Domino, the Platters and others are great.  There is an interesting extra covering Jayne's life.

""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" was originally a play and one that Jayne starred in.  A young Tony Randall reveals the big star he would later become.  Jayne herself does a fantastic job playing a Marilyn Monroe type and shows a real flair for comedy.  This is largely a satire about advertising, television, and film star fandom.  Jayne's husband Mickey Hargitay has a bit part.  The ending has a special surprise for TV Land type buffs.

Jayne Mansfield really has an opportunity to break away from stereotypes in the Western, ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"".  It is a plot that has been done before, however Kenneth Moore as an Englishman who stumbles in to becoming an unwilling sheriff and Jayne as the owner of a hotel/saloon pull it off.  Plenty of action and fun, the type of thing that we miss in those old and great Western films.

They could not have grouped together a better set of films and it pays homage to a great age and a great lady.  It is a shame she died so young and did not get to see what an outstanding actress her daughter, Mariska Hargitay, would become.  Mariska won a long deserved best actress emmy for her work in ""Law and Order: SVU"" and Jayne would have been proud.  The recognition as an actress that eluded Jayne Mansfiled has been acheived by her daughter.",1160438400,,2558,4.65625
3295021,5,B00115HMMM,"I bought the set, but I don't know whether I'll get around to watching the other 2 films.  ""The Girl Can't Help It"" is undoubtedly the BEST of the early rock 'n' roll films.  Not only is it in color and CinemaScope, but it actually has a decent storyline.  (My other favorite, ""Jamboree,"" has one of the worst storylines I've ever seen, although the music is great.)

It was great to bring back the memories of seeing this film in a theater.  Some of the scenes were as I remember them, but I had actually forgotten the surprise ending.

The musical performances are GREAT, especially Little Richard, Fats Domino, Gene Vincent, The Platters, and a VERY young Eddie Cochran.  The only complaint I have is that some of the performances are interrupted by dialogue, but that is a minor problem.

As you watch this film, you can't help being jealous of Tom Ewell, who made two classic films and got the chance to act opposite screen legends Jayne Mansfield AND Marilyn Monroe!  Jayne looks simply amazing in this film!

If you watch this, be sure to check out the commentary track.  Lots of interesting background info, including Col. Tom Parker's refusal to let Elvis appear in this film because the studio wouldn't meet his asking price of $50,000.  Also look for a brief appearance by a young and THIN Phil Silvers as a milkman.  (Does anybody remember milkmen?)",1157068800,,1361,4.668067226890757
3295022,5,B00115HMMM,"Jayne Mansfield has become one of the most legendary names of 1950's cinema, ironic given many dismissed her at the time as a Marilyn Monroe clone which impeded her career (only seven major films at 20th Century-Fox and virtually everything else she was in was a low-budget ""independent"" film given scant release and attention).  Yet like the unprolific James Dean, Grace Kelly, and Mae West, Jayne Mansfield remains a legendary pop culture icon far more so than many stars with 60 or more motion pictures to their credit.  I think it's because like Dean, Kelly, and West, Jayne Mansfield hit the bullseye in a few pictures and it was enough to cement her legend.  Both of Mansfield's bell-ringers, THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT and WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER, are on this collection with the  added treat of a good little comedy-western THE SHERIFF OF FRACTURED JAW.

THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT - Jayne stars with Tom Ewell (Monroe's comic leading man in THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH) in this comedy with music about a record promoter hired by a gangster to promote his talentless mistress into a pop singer.  The three leading roles seem perilously close to those from BORN YESTERDAY but with it's three distinctive performers (Edmond O'Brien being the third) it's not that noticable. Jayne plays the girl (duh!!!) who despite her figure resembling a Playboy cartoon really wants to be nothing but a home-loving wife (""Nobody thinks I'm equipped for motherhood"" she sighs, as her double D's practically pop out of her dress.) Director Frank Tashlin was a former cartoonist and the movie resembles an animated picture with outrageous sight gags and wacky humor.  And the movie is loaded with music numbers that ""expresses the culture, the refinement,  and polite grace of the present day"" - rock n' roll, baby!! Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Platters, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and others making rare appearances in a major motion picture.  GIRL is frequently mentioned as a candidate for the greatest rock n'roll movie of alltime for it's amazing musical performances and with the superb comedy work of Mansfield, Ewell, and O'Brien, you could hardly ask for more.

WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER - This 1957 satire has an astonishing sharp bite more than 40 years after it's initial release! The movie is loaded with sharp barbs on America's obssession with sexy blondes, big breasts, ""personality"" movie stars who want to be pretentious dramatic ones, two celebrities in ""love"" who have their every move covered by the press, ordinary citizens turned into media celebrities (or ""reality stars"" as we call them now), and television and commercials everywhere you turn makes you wonder if we've really changed at all in 50 years.

Jayne's delicious perfomrmance here is as good as any of Marilyn Monroe and Jean Harlow's best comic work. And she is definately an original.  Despite the Monroe comparsions, it's hard to imagine Marilyn playing the spirited heroines of GIRL and ROCK, Jayne is maybe closer to an inflated Debbie Reynolds.

I did find Tony Randall a little unappealing, a movie leading man he ain't, even when playing a blah sort who gets hyped into stardom. All through the picture I kept thinking how awesome Jack Lemmon would have been in this role. Randall's not bad though and he doesn't hurt the picture. But he does make our Jaynie work overtime keeping the film lively.

Joan Blondell is enjoyable in one of her early films as a character actress, having been quite a sexy blonde lead herself in the 1930's and 1940's. Betsy Drake (best known as one of Cary Grant's wives) is an appealing ingenue sort as the real girlfriend of ""Lover Doll"" Randall who must stand by and watch the media promote Jayne and Tony as one of the great love stories of the era. The movie is hilarious from the opening credits to the final minute - but above all, this is a perfect showcase for the special talents of Miss Jayne Mansfield!!

SHERIFF OF FRACTURED JAW - directed by the great Raoul Walsh, this color comic western casts Jayne as a saloon owner who helps Englishman Kenneth More adapt to life in the Old West and his new position as sheriff.  More is fairly forgotten today but in the 1950's he was considered a potential heir to Laurence Oliver's throne as England's leading actor so being cast opposite him was rather prestigious for Jayne, who tones down her sex kitten act (although those tight period dresses make her look maybe  bustier than ever even if there is no hint of clevage.) This is the sort of pleasant, somewhat unmemorable movie many stars make over and over.  This 1959 release unexpectedly proved the end of Jayne's glory days in Hollywood, although she would remained famous until her death in 1967 and was considered a big star at least until 1962.  She was sadly wasted in scores of ""B"" and ""D"" films in the 1960's but she likely will always remain a legend due to her pair of beauties - THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT and WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER.",1155945600,,4974,4.796491228070176
3295023,4,B00115HMMM,"I am a die-hard, dyed in the wool Jayne Mansfield fan. I am completely delighted that there is finally a Jayne set out. Despite the often simple comparison to Marilyn Monroe, Jayne was a different kind of ""dumb blonde"". Jayne had a screen energy and luminosity that could captivate a person. She was a comedic talent that, unfortunately was not allowed to shine as much as it should have.

This collection is nice. A lot of Mansfield fans have been waiting for ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?""  and ""The Girl Can't Help It"" to be realeased on DVD. The one disappointment is the missing movies. Jayne's career included some, albeit, low budget and explotation films, but her career could be better represented. This set would have been more complete with the addition of ""Kiss Them For Me"", ""The Wayward Bus"" and ""It Happened in Athens"". At least that would logically keep on track with her career and offer the viewer a better sampling of her tantalizing, fabulous persona. Unfortunately, this set does limit her as an actress, just has Hollywood did. But Jayne is a treat, in any size portion!",1155427200,,1095,4.757894736842105

""Will Success Spoil Rock Junter?"" with commentary by ""film historian"" Dana Polan. Brief newsreel clip on Mansfield in the U.S. capital. The English audio actually appears to be in four-channel. Spanish stereo.

3295025,4,B00115HMMM,"Although Jayne Mansfield never reached the heights of popularity and fame
of Marilyn Monroe, her films are highly entertaining, campy and great fun.
I am not familiar with The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw, but I rate
Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (with Tony Randall) as a little gem of a Cinemascope,
Technicolor comedy. As she does in all her films, Jayne plays
a highly exaggerated parody of Monroe, but brings her own brand of humor
and sweetness to her roles. The Girl Can't Help It (also Technicolor and Cinemascope) has a big bonus because it features some legendary music stars of the 1950s: Fats Domino, The Platters, Gene Vincent and Little Richard. This one's a must for fans of early Rock 'n Roll. I forgot to mention that sultry Julie London sings her huge pop hit, ""Cry Me A River"".
All the films look beautiful. The colors are rich and fresh as when the films were first released.
The Girl Can't Help It looks most amazing! You will not be disappointed.",1150675200,,965,4.649122807017544

This was more Tony Randall's movie as it really was about him most of the time. Did not care for how women were made out to be just ""arm candy"". Quite a dumb movie and it would be torture to have to watch this selection again. It's Jane Russell whom I like and was thinking of.",1526774400,,432,3.865168539325843
