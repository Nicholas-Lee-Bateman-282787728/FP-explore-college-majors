4702089,1,B005HMHPHC,"They break this up into vol. 1 and vol. 2 to make more money obviously. DVDs have been out for years and they just bring this out and then rip you off by dividing it up to screw you. If you wait and they don't sell then you get them together cheaper. Just like my favorite show NCIS, they come out at over 40.00 per season. I have bought most at 15.00, because I don't have to have them as soon as they come out. Wise up people.",1324080000,4,428,3.875
4702090,5,B005HMHPHC,"I always liked Rawhide.  It was certainly one of the most interesting Western series with its fine actors, great production values, and sometimes unconventional plot twists.  I've bought the entire series up to now.",1323388800,6,215,5.294117647058823
4702091,5,B005HMHPHC,"Rawhide Season 4, Volume 2 is another terrific western in which the characters truly make you feel as if you were there.  If you like westerns as much as I do, then you'll want to add this DVD

4702092,5,B005HMHPHC,"I cannot get tired of this series. I heard Westerns Channel plans to air the series starting in January. Looks like I'll be watching more of ""Rawhide"" than I expected. I am very picky about the picture quality of the TV shows and CBS has done a magnificent job transferring them from the original masters for this DVD release. If you are concerned about whether or not the episodes are uncut, unedited or gorgeous quality have no fear. Buy with confidence. I hope CBS puts them all out.",1322006400,9,486,4.534090909090909
4702093,5,B005HMHPHC,"First, I would like to thank CBS/Paramount for continuing to produce Rawhide on DVD. However, the wait between seasons 3 and 4 was way too long. Hopefully, they will produce seasons 5 to 8 in yearly installments beginning in 2012.
The artwork on the DVD's is excellent. However, someone forgot Eric Fleming on  the season 4, volume 2 artwork.
CBS produced 30 episodes for the 1961-62 season.
The last two episodes filmed, ""The Devil and the Deep Blue"" and ""Abilene"" were a 2 episode arc about the herd arriving in Abilene. (This was similar to what they did in season 3, with ""Near the Promised Land"" and ""The Big Blowout"", about the herd arriving in Sedelia).
""Abilene"" was scheduled to air May 18,1962, but was pulled and a a repeat of the ""Peddler"" aired instead. ""Abilene"" was next scheduled to lead off as the season premiere for the 1962-63 season, to air September 21,1962. (Coincidently, ""The Devil and the Deep Blue"" was rerun on Sept. 14,1962). It was again pulled from the schedule, and ""Incident of El Toro"" aired as the season premiere(""El Toro"" was rerun April 9,1964 and Dec. 25, 1964). ""Abilene"" was finally ""burned off""(aired) on May 31,1963.
The continued reshuffling of Abilene made no sense. The 1962-63 season involved the trail drive going to Denver to feed the miners who needed beef.
Perhaps there is still a Rawhide producer and long retired CBS executive that could explain this.
I've noticed that episode guides/books sometimes list wrong original air dates of shows. This is because the network changed their minds on episodes after TV Guide, newspaper tv guides, etc. went to press. Errors are also made by viewing syndicated/cable episodes which usually have 3-5 minutes cut from the original masters, when writing about episodes.
Rawhide was a great western; top notch directors, writers, location filming.
Unfortunately, CBS made mistakes on moving Rawhide to Thursdays for the 1963-64 season, and Tuesdays for the 1965-66 season. Otherwise, I believe it could have gone another 2-3 seasons.
Would love to hear any comments,etc.
My greatest wish would be for CBS to do a reboot of Gunsmoke/Rawhide.",1320796800,17,2130,5.0

4702095,5,B005HMHPHC,"I have all 4 seasons of Rawhide and LOVE the show.
Sure hope CBS Paramount get us all the way to Season 8.
Note: The box says that the final episode called ""Abilene"" is part of Season 5 but all my research says it was the last episode of Season 4 broadcast on 18 May 1962 one week after ""The Devil & The Deep Blue.""",1320624000,2,315,3.8615384615384616
4702096,5,B005HMHPHC,"This is a classic western series with a young Clint Eastwood in support. This is the continuing series of a cattle drive and the adventures encountered by it's cowhands. This series is very entertaining and makes you believe that this is how it really was on a cattle drive. Plenty of guest stars in each episode. Plus the classic song by Frankie Laine.
 Have got all the previous seasons and am looking forward to more. Thanks CBS for releasing this show. Classic TV at it's best.",1320537600,,481,4.593023255813954

4702100,3,B005HMHPHC,"I got  series 2 season 4 , after being a huge fan of Rawhide when it aired on cbs on the late 50's. Disappointed when I bought season 4 part 2 and missed sheb wooley / as pete nolan as CBS tried to force a guy named clay forrester played by charles gray down our throats, a nice guy in real life i'm sure but 0 charisma on Rawhide, as I did not see sheb wooley after the deserters patrol episode. His pictue was on the dvd cover but not much pete nolan so will only buy earlier releases. Finally around season 3 CBS began alternating rowdy and trail boss gil favor as the star of each episode when the pair was on screen together in earlier episodes it was their magic together and loyalty to one another as favor brought young yates around slowly preparing him to take over as trail boss when Mr. Favor saved enough to buy his dream ranch and reunite his family that gave Rawhide its unique place in the tv westerns of the period..CBS made many mistakes during the evolution of Rawhide but it manage to stay on for 8 or nine years. Clay Forrester disappeared early in his second season although he kept his high billing throughout his 2nd second season the result of his 2 year contract and was only seen briefly from time to time.",1423094400,,1232,4.264957264957265

4702125,5,B005HMHPHC,"Rawhide! The best television show ever made! Starring the greatest actor of all time! No,not Clint Eastwood(although he is great),but Eric Fleming the one that made the show. He is by far the greatest cowboy ever caught on film. He was Gil Favor. Mr. Favor is what he is because of what Eric put into him. Eric didn't become a character based on some description, he made his character. Far outdoing James Arness and Raymond Burr in the creation of their characters. He naturally was a leader with the commanding presence that few have. A presence that is a Divine anointing like George Washington and Absalom had. He used the training of his hard life to make him the tough, honest, fair, kind, forgiving, strong, determined, focused, wise, experienced, compassionate, iron-willed trail boss we all know and love. May I also add he had the looks of Absalom to. God was being provident when He gave Eric his gorgeous, booming, baritone voice. He knew he would need it or else you wouldn't hear anything he had to say do to being enthralled in his beauty. This great man led an army of also great men. With beautiful and completely rotten Clint Eastwood as beautiful and completely rotten Rowdy Yates,ramrod of the Favor drive. Handsome and talented Sheb Wooley as wise, well informed scout Pete Nolan. Pretty, intelligent James Murdock as the loveable cooks louse Harkness ""Mushy"" Mushgrove. Paul Brinegar as eternally ill, but caring Wishbone. Also, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan as the always in a scrape Jim Quince and Joe Scarlett(respectively). This is the army of men fighting a fierce foe of 3000 doagies,fierce redskins,comancheros,and loose women. These are the guys you call on if your in a jam. A wonderful cast deserving of a wonderful show that they received. I only wish that Rawhide had been the western to run for 20 years. But it in it's seven year eight season run had more impact than those that did. I am glad that I have all eight seasons and 217 episodes on DVD to pop in and love anytime I want. Rawhide I believe will never be equaled or surpassed. It is the Ben-Hur of television. It more than deserves an Emmy. It will always be rollin,rollin,rollin. Love to all them boys. Love ya. Keep them doagies movin,RAWHIDE!",1332115200,11,2241,4.748717948717949
4702126,5,B005HMHPHC,"I tried this show on a whim because I am a huge fan of both Clint Eastwood and of Gunsmoke.  I must say that I am very glad I did!  Rawhide is a lot of fun and keeps me entertained episode after episode.  I am way to young to have seen this when it was originally on TV and am glad I am now getting the opportunity to see it.  Clint Eastwood's character ""Rowdy Yates"" is very personable and shows that even in his early career Eastwood was a superb actor.  Although I must admit the price is kind of high for these and I am not thrilled with the splitting up of the second season and beyond, the show is great and I I plan on buying every season as they become available. I hope that, unlike with Gunsmoke, I will not be waiting until I am 60 to see the rest on DVD.  With all the other crap like 'Jersey Shore' out there that comes out on DVD season after season I can't see why the quality shows take so long!",1330387200,2,911,3.9508196721311477
