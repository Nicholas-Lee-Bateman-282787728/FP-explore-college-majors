4111925,5,B003DLTBX0,"Just watched ""Adopted"". I really liked it. I thought of it as a comedy, with heart.
I liked it, when Pauly was talking to people in the streets of Africa, and said he wanted to adopt a child from Africa and give them a better life in L.A.; and the response was, why adopt from Africa when there are so many American children he could adopt (ok, it's not word-for-word, but I appreciated the point that was made in that statement).
I appreciated, also, at the very end of the movie, the seriousness of adoption was acknowledged, along with these numbers: Africa, 34 Million orphans; Asia, 85 Million orphans; Latin America, 12 Million orphans; United States, 514,000 Orphans.

My personal feeling is that it's Pauly Shore's best movie yet (and that is saying a lot<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adopted/dp/B003DLTBX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adopted</a>!

4111947,1,B003DLTBX0,"Hated this patronizing view of Africans.  I know it's supposed to be making fun of the adoption process itself and the perception that people go to ""shop"" for kids, but I hated how he went about doing this and really felt sorry for the actors or real people being put on the spot.  They all looked awkward and it wasn't just the kids.  Also, the kids are about 10-12, not infants as shown.",1470009600,2,389,4.301369863013699

4111962,2,B003DLTBX0,It just seemed to silly to me. Kind of dragged out to the premise of the adoption. Never finished the first show.,1467504000,,113,4.181818181818182
4111963,1,B003DLTBX0,Pauly Shore has a weird sense of humor which is funny in his movies but not in this.  Is it a movie or a documentary?  Either way it was not funny to me.  He's annoying and stupid in it.  Yes he's usually stupid but not annoying in his movies.  I would not recommend it.,1466899200,,270,3.925925925925926

4111969,1,B003DLTBX0,"This movie exploited the concept of adoption.  He went to an agency.  They allowed him have a kid for a day to see who he liked.  During that time, he neglected the children. He was too busy going after girls, and not paying attention to the kids.  He lost one for a wile. The last one robbed him, while he left a girl in a hotel room.  While he went off to do a comedy act. He came back to the room with two hot girls. When found out that everything was gone, even his condoms too.  The two girls left him too. This movie was a waste of money to make. Also wasting the time of some adoption agency that trusted him with small children. He tried to make up for his stupid film, by showing how many orphans are in Africa, America, and some other country.  Also they mentioned  unicef web site address too, for good measure.",1437782400,,822,4.1257861635220126
4111970,5,B003DLTBX0,very weird movie...pauly shore is groovy...i would watch anything this cat does for some reason...very corny movie though but in a good way,1429747200,,139,5.086956521739131

4111973,1,B003DLTBX0,"I love Paulie shore movies but this was highly offensive to blacks.  Its not a movie, its more like a documentary and he is patting black people on their heads like they are dogs. I am surprised he made such a film.",1394668800,3,215,4.119047619047619
4111974,5,B003DLTBX0,"This movie is truly artistic and funny! Those who say it is offensive simply don't understand that Pauly is not really that way! Plus, this movie is not real! It's like borat, and bruno...stuff like that! Pauly even said himself that this is not the true pauly shore! If it were, people would fall asleep! And for the people who say it's sad that the children ""got hurt in the process"" don't understand that the children all had tons of food for them, games, a table full of treats and snacks and their parents were there the whole time!! And Pauly truly does respect and understand Africa:) overall it was a very funny movie that was full of heart! I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor!!!",1344297600,5,699,4.426356589147287
4111975,1,B003DLTBX0,"Using these children so he can make a 'mockumentary', never considering them or their feelings, only considering himself and what he wants and needs.......Even if it is only 'acting', some of the scenes have him touching these kids in an icky way, and the things he says and does are disgusting and sick.....I wonder if he even KNOWS how yucky this mess is.........and not funny at all.....

I have no doubt he's a racist after seeing this display, but even without that aspect, no way this man should ever be allowed to have kids, even 'actors', in his care or under his authority.....what a jerk......",1343433600,2,603,4.742857142857143
4111976,1,B003DLTBX0,"This movie is outrageous. The two lower points: racism and lack of respect. Lack of creativity and cliche (as saying all black people look alike). Kids was mistreat and emotionally abused there(as when Pauly Shore start talking bad about the hair of a black kid, call other black kid chubby, or thrown other black kid at floor pretending he was being arrested? Why he didn't got any white kids there, as his audience for his show in the same place, same movie, were all white?) And come on, kids in the rain? Losing kids from orphanage? All this abuse was only because the kids were black? Black kids are thieves? Really?
Could somebody imagine a black person going to Sweden to adopt white kids and losing then or mocking about their appearence being considered ""funny""? That's just wrong, nothing new.",1332979200,3,803,4.742857142857143
4111977,1,B003DLTBX0,"This so called ""Movie"" not only is one of the stupidest things I have ever witnessed,  It is extremely offensive to Africans,  black people and the whole adoption process.  If Pauly Shore ever visits African again he better hope some of it's citizens hasn't seen this movie or he may just not make it out alive.  I do not see how anyone with half a brain thinks this movie is funny!  I realize it is supposed to be a comedy.  But this is ridiculous!  The little paragraph at the end by Pauly explaining that even though he made fun of adoption, that adoption is a serious matter makes it even worse in my opinion.  What a tasteless piece of Garbage!  I will NEVER watch anything that has Pauly Shore in it again EVER!  i had to give this one star in order to post and that is the ONLY reason I gave it 1 star!",1317427200,8,809,4.161290322580645
8394839,1,B003DLTBX0,"Pauly Shore is a narcissistic jerk who thinks he's talented. I never found him funny and I LOVE good comics. He ain't one of them. I happened to just watch this on a free HBO weekend so I'm only out time. What I hated about this movie most (there was a lot to hate too!) is that the one little kid actually thought Pauly gave a crap about him and thought he was going to actually get adopted and get out of that hell hole part of Africa. Kid was only getting used. In the end, Pauly just abandoned them all....again.",1523491200,,516,4.118811881188119
8394840,4,B003DLTBX0,"This film surprised me. Overall warm hearted, funny with a Slight
edge. A lot of the film was improv.  (But Pauly didn't actually snatch strange kids off the street-Im sure. Yes? 1 reviewer didn't think so .) Its apparent he would like to be a Father, is very schmaltzy.  He Seems aware he's not well-equipped right now.
Some of the jokes may seem insensitive, You can see the humanity beneath them. And, IF this film moves appropriate adults to consider adoption-perhaps a little older child, even-- I wouldnt be surprised. I also laughed Out-Loud! Also Im not an 'International Gal' and liked seeing the sights. Some of the jokes may seem insensitive. You can see the humanity intended behind them. IF this film moves appropriate adults to consider  adopting a child-perhaps a little older  older child, even-I wouldnt be surprised Warm & heartfelt.
