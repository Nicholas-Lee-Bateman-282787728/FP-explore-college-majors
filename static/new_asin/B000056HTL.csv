7932007,1,B000056HTL,"This DVD seemed too much like an amateurish home made one rather than a real professional DVD. A cute cat and wolf growing up with one another & doing their thing with an old man viewing on giving his comments about the activity.
There was nothing real exciting about it, so I see it as a waste of money. Too bad I'm the first to review it. a friend and I watched this almost two weeks ago. Sowwy for the disappointment, just the truth.
I have a loving affection for all kinds of cats, and it's too bad I can't get the money I paid for this, sadly enough.",1027382400,6,555,4.10091743119266
