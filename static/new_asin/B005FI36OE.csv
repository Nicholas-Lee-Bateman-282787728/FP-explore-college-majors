4674449,5,B005FI36OE,"If you saw Jackie Evancho perform on the PBS Great Performance series this year, no doubt you will anticipate the release of ""Dream With Me in Concert,"" especially if you were unable to afford the donation cost to receive it.  The concert, performed at  The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, featured 10-year-old Jackie.  David Foster, co-host and musical director, had that knowing glint in his eye that signaled he knew her voice was simply miraculous.  Once you've heard it you too will agree.  On this DVD one of my favorite performances was Giacomo Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma"" from the Turandot.  No other way to say it, but it was simply stunning.  Foster, who only works with ""the best,"" realized this as soon as he heard her perform.

I have, like many others, purchased ""Dream With Me"" and ""O Holy Night,"" yet am still astounded by the depth of her voice at such a young age.  Everyone who has ever seen her perform, whether it be on television or the Internet, is mesmerized and wonders how this voice can emanate from someone so small.  Since this concert was performed one can hear a subtle maturity in Jackie's voice and can only wonder what the future will hold for her.  One additional feature that you will get with this DVD will be two additional tracks that you did not see in the PBS performances in June and August.  This DVD along with the CDs, ""O Holy Night,"" ""Dream With Me,"" will not only attract the classical fan, but will begin to attract a younger audience to opera.

America's Got Talent was her beginning showcase that skyrocketed her to the attention of the world.  Do you remember when she performed ""O Mio Babbino Caro?""  Connie Talbot, Susan Boyle, and Paul Potts awed us, but Jackie Evancho's voice seemingly came out of nowhere to appeal to audiences of all types.  It simply amazes me that people of all ages can relate to and love her voice.  I shared my copy of ""Dream With Me"" with an eighty something friend the other day.  It was one of those indescribable moments.  She listened in awe and then offered me her Puccini collection.  This DVD is simply another one of the offerings by Jackie Evancho that can be shared by an assortment of music lovers of all ages.  Jackie has a miraculous voice and to see her perform adds dimension to the music.  If you've purchased either one of her CDs, or seen her on PBS, you're in for a real treat when you see her in concert.",1313625600,39,2421,4.529953917050691
4674450,5,B005FI36OE,"I parrot what so many others have said about Jackie Evancho - her personality is so adorable that every senior such as myself immediately adopts her as our ""virtual"" grandchild. And beyond that, she may just have the most beautiful voice in the music world today.

Then there's this video!  Audio and video perfection was obviously the goal of its creators, and they have achieved their goal!  Surpassed it if possible.  I bought this from PBS when it cost $100.  I'll buy more now to give to my closest friends.  Don't think for a moment that the CD is as good.  That would be like trying to listen to ballet on the radio!  You just have to see Jackie!

I won't try to describe the experience of watching this because I'm not eloquent enough.  I've watched it about six times and will watch it many more times, that's all I can say (except I can't wait for miss Evancho's next DVD).",1313539200,54,883,4.428571428571429
4674451,5,B005FI36OE,"Jackie Evancho is one in a billion, a darling girl with an immaculate voice and, at only 11 years of age, the talent and poise of a seasoned professional. Nearly everyone has seen clips of her amazing performances in last year's America's Got Talent competition, which she inexplicably lost to country/soul singer Michael Grimm. But now you can enjoy an entire program of live songs from her first full-length album, ""Dream with Me.""

Assisted by her producer, arranger, and pianist, David Foster, and accompanied by orchestra and chorus, Jackie sings 15 songs from a variety of genres: opera, musical theater, and film as well as popular and sacred pieces. It's clear she feels the music deeply, and she communicates it powerfully, demonstrating flawless diction and phrasing, an astoundingly pure tone, and pitch-perfect vibrato. A couple of the songs are performed in intimate chamber settings, and one, ""Somewhere,"" is sung as a duet with a 1985 video by Barbra Streisand.

We not only watch this delightful prodigy express herself on stage; we also get to meet her in brief interviews in which she talks about her development as an artist and about all the fun she's having. She and Foster tour the venue for the concert, the spectacular Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida.

""Dream with Me in Concert,"" which premiered on PBS, was recorded when Jackie was just 10 years old. It's one that every music lover will want to own and will play again and again. And just think of what's yet to come in her still very young career!

You can preview ""Angel"" and ""Nessun Dorma,"" two clips from this DVD, by searching for Jackie Evancho at the pbs.org website, where you also can find out when this program will air again on your local PBS station.",1313107200,115,1751,4.826666666666667
4674452,5,B005FI36OE,"To everyone ordering this DVD, you are going to be thrilled with it! I've already purchased one from my local PBS station, and am ordering multiple copies of this now here from Amazon. These will make exquisite Christmas gifts. You will treasure this DVD - guaranteed! There is just no way to describe how wonderful this precious young girl is. She is the personification of beauty - vocally, physically, and spiritually. David Foster has done a great job of fostering (pardon the pun) her talent, and they'll be teaming up again in December for a big concert in Vegas. This DVD is a must-have for anyone familiar with this angel and I'm sure will be a classic.",1313107200,77,661,4.6581196581196584

Anybody purchasing this already knows what a wonderful voice Miss Evancho has or you wouldn't be buying it, but to own the DVD is a joy.  Not only do you get to watch a couple live performances on the DVD, you get a nice collection of 15 songs as a CD.  Her talent is beyond belief and I would recommend this to anyone.

4674460,5,B005FI36OE,Truly amazing to watch someone this age completely captivate an audience like she did. I do envy those that we're able to attend this concert. I lived through the Beatles phenomenon and like most people was a fan. If I had the choice to go back and be at the Ed Sullivan taping when they were first introduced on his show to America or be at this Dream With Me concert I would chose Jackie every time without hesitation. Not very often in life you get to witness something as special as this girl.,1477612800,,497,4.297872340425532

4674463,5,B005FI36OE,"I bought this DVD from Amazon in Germany after stumbling across Jackie Evancho's videos on youtube in mid 2016 more or less by accident. I was stunned that a girl her age could have such a wonderful voice and perform in such a beautiful natural way. I was deeply touched listening to her perform ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" the first of her videos I had come across on the web.

Never before have I written a review on Amazon but this artist has a kind of magic about her that is very unique and this DVD will give you a first glance at her talent. Listening to and seeing her perform has given me feelings of warmth and happiness that I had never experienced before listening to a musical performance.

Unfortunately here in Germany not many people know Jackie and the selection of video media is limited to the ""Dream with me Concert"" DVD which is recorded in the US NTSC format and thus will not play on many European players. Had I known that a Blu-Ray is available from Amazon in the US I would have ordered that instead.

Be careful though, if you buy this DVD you may get hooked like I did and you may just end up ordering more CDs and DVDs of Jackie :-)",1472947200,,1154,4.260273972602739

I have two posters of her in my room, one that I spent a really long time saving up for because it was autographed by her. I have all her CD's and a t-shirt of her that I wear all the time. She's my favorite singer by far and it would be my dream to meet her. Many people have all ready said this, but Jackie's voice is absolutely incredible. In order to really describe it, I would have to invent a whole new word. I can't believe some people say she's lip synching because she must have proved it over a hundred times by now! If you look closely at her mouth while she is singing, you can tell that it's her real voice. I love all of the songs here, but my favorite would have to be ""Dark Waltz."" It's too bad that's not on the CD. I hope that Jackie never stops singing and has a long career ahead of her.

***

There is a paradox to Jackie Evancho which strikes everyone upon seeing her for the first time.  You know how sometimes you see clips of those 11-year-old kids who play in the Little League World Series, and some of them are built like Terminator-era Arnold Schwarzenegger?  After seeing that, suddenly any homeruns those kids hit aren't quite so impressive.

There are some children who are beautiful singers with beautiful child-like singing voices.  And there are some kids who have beautifully mature-sounding singing voices, yet are in their own way like those Schwarzenegger-esque Little Leaguers.  Don't get me wrong.  Such singers are not necessarily built like redwoods and I doubt they can bench press as much as Arnold.  I just mean that some young people become physical adults much earlier than others.

The strange thing about Jackie Evancho (circa 2011 when this concert was shot) is that she doesn't seem to fall into either of the above categories.  She's a tiny little girl with a tiny little girl speaking voice.  It's when she starts to sing that your world turns on end.  That's when she starts channeling the dead ghost of Mario Lanza.  That's when she starts hitting homerun after homerun.  It's a clich to say, but in Jackie Evancho's case it's true:  She could sing a Chinese take-out menu and it would sound good.

If you've never heard of Jackie Evancho or don't know what she sounds like, I'm not sure any pre-study is needed.  All you need to do before clicking on the ""Add to Cart"" button is ask this simple question:  Am I the sort of person who would enjoy seeing a naturally-gifted musical prodigy totally in the zone and ""bringing it"" before a full orchestra?  Or am I the sort of person who finds the very idea of an eleven year old headlining her own ""Great Performances"" special morally repugnant?  If you fall into the former category, then congratulations.  Just put the DVD in your cart and head for the virtual checkout.  I promise you you'll enjoy it.  Yes, she's that good, and the production serves her that well.

(It also helps to know that she's singing ""classical crossover"" style, a girl version of Adrea Bocelli if you will, so don't expect some Christina Aguilera-esque belting.)

If you're wondering how much of the appeal of this concert is a ""gimmick,"" stop wondering.  While there's clearly a certain novelty to the fact that this amazing voice is coming out of Thumbelina, there are a number of selections here where the quality of her singing is so good, age becomes irrelevant.  (And that's an important qualifier.  There are some very popular child singers who are clearly *purely* novelty acts. Remove their age from the equation and you'd be hard pressed to call them average singers, let alone extraordinary.)  Pay special note to such pieces like ""The Lord's Prayer,"" ""Nella Fantasia"" and ""Lovers.""  The purity and richness of tone Evancho achieves during these segments are so marvelous, that I think it's no exaggeration to say that this concert performance could stack up against just about any other in history, regardless of genre or age of the performers.

In other more mainstream selections--such as ""Angel"" and ""Somewhere""--it's her emotional investment that gets you.  She's so ""into"" the music that it's practically like watching a punk rocker, or Fiona Apple on her most 'emo' of days.  This is what others have referred to when they say that Evancho is almost ""possessed"" by the music.  I love it.

It all combines into something so unusual and remarkable that it begins to feel at a certain point that this isn't merely a PBS concert special but a historic event of some kind, like a mass UFO sighting that they were fortunate enough to capture on video.

I know this might turn my review into kind of a downer, but I did want to put my own spin on a couple of the criticisms one stumbles across when it comes to Jackie Evancho.  These are issues one will inevitably encounter should they decide to become an Evancho fan.  (Or at least an Evancho fan active on the internet.)  Yes, it is a little strange at first blush that one as seemingly benign, guileless and non-threatening as Jackie Evancho could be the source of so much protest.  But I suppose that when anything or anyone becomes popular, people get riled up.

It seems that there is a segment of the ""music expert"" population which feels Jackie Evancho has no business being on stage.  I've seen statements like:  ""I'm sure to the uneducated masses she might sound pleasing.  But those of us with higher intelligence know she is far inferior sounding to those of us who have trained at our craft.""

I'm not exaggerating with that above statement.  Okay, I played around with that second sentence a little, but I swear to God that first sentence comes up in one form or another when reading about Evancho.

""Experts"" like to weigh in on Evancho's technique.  And that's fine.  I think that's a valid discussion when presented in a caring and respectful manner.  Unfortunately it almost never is.  Almost invariably it is couched in smirking poison.  You will find ""expert music critics"" making baseless insinuations about Evancho's family, bizarre and scandalous remarks about her appearance, desperate insistence about how she sounds terrible, etc, etc.  And hidden within all that green dung may lay a small kernel of legitimate concern about whether her technique is proper and healthy.

Since I know nothing about what constitutes proper singing technique, I cannot comment if Evancho is employing one or not.  I only want to relate that issue to something I do know about, and that is whether a singer sounds good.  Some critics seem to think there is some direct correlation between whether something sounds good and whether the technique is proper.  They will point to how her posture is this or that, or how her mouth isn't moving in the correct way--and then they will come to the conclusion of, ""See?  She obviously doesn't sound good when she looks like that.  How can anyone sound good singing that way?""  (And then they might direct you to a clip of a ""real"" singer who is using all the proper techniques and who also just happens to sound like a dying animal.)

Trust me folks, Evancho sounds good.  It's a voice that's memorable for it's purity, and those bell-like tones might account for why people have a tendency to dab away tears upon hearing it for the first time.  I don't know if she's using all the improper technique in the world.  I don't know if her kidneys are in the right spot or if she's angling her earlobes the wrong way.  But she sounds supernaturally good.  You'd have to have your head in some dark orifice not to acknowledge that.  I think people who couch arguments in terms of, ""She sounds good ... for a child,"" or, ""I'm sure she's pleasant sounding enough to the uneducated,"" are kind of missing the boat.

I have also read the argument that fans are only enamored of Evancho's voice due to the fact that it's coming from a child. While there is obviously some truth that she wouldn't get nearly the same incredulous response if she were in fact a 30-year-old performing on stage with a voice like that--to go so completely beyond that as some ""experts"" do with the notion that her voice doesn't sound good is preposterous.

You can perform this test for yourself.  If you have a friend who is not familiar with Jackie Evancho, play them the audio from this concert or the album ""Dream with Me.""  Invariably the listener will have a reaction akin to, ""Who is that singer?  They're fantastic.""  Because Evancho's pure, bell-like clarity** is something that gets anyone's attention.  It is only after your friend is shown video of this little girl performing does the shock set in.

It's ironic how some critics insist that fans of Evancho only respond to her due to the juxtaposition of her physical size vs. her singing voice, when it seems to me it is *they* who are basing a response on that surreal contradiction.  Only theirs is a negative reaction.  An almost desperately negative reaction.

**(Honestly, the closest comparison I can think of is Maria McKee's voice, the former singer for the group Lone Justice, then later a solo artist.  True, McKee sings in a completely different timbre, style and genre, but that same bell-like clarity is there.  I believe it is this bell-like quality to Evancho's singing which is above all else--above her age, above the fact that she came to people's attention on a reality show--the reason she has garnered such an enthusiastic fan base.  It is this reason that people so often report breaking down in tears or getting goosebumps hearing her sing.)

Will Evancho's voice last?  I have no idea.  I sure hope so.  It's quite possible she could do everything right, act responsibly, not strain her voice in the least and keep it fit as a fiddle--yet still lose that aural beauty when she's at the tail end of puberty.  Stuff like that happens when your body rearranges itself.  (At present, her voice is already a bit different than it was when this concert was taped.  It may change yet still.  And the reason may simply be that she's growing up.)  Regardless, I don't think the judging of aesthetics and art should be done with ""longevity"" and practicality in mind.  Or at least those shouldn't be the lone concerns.  In other words, I don't think someone who has a 60-year career as a mediocre, screeching chicken is automatically a better singer than someone with a short-lived career as a velvet wonder.

(I've thought about this and I can think of few other creative fields where such thinking is the accepted norm, where proper technique and longevity seem to be the sole concerns when gauging the quality of the results.  ""Oh, sure, that roasted chicken may have seemed delicious to the uneducated.  But I saw the angle at which the chef was moving his arm when he was applying the spice rub and it wasn't proper at all!"")

Whether or not Evancho has a 50 year career, or ends up shooting briefly into the night sky like a white-hot Roman candle from Fourth of July doesn't make a bit of difference in regards to the beauty or quality of this performance.  In this moment, on this night, in this concert, she's just about the most gifted, engaging and entrancing singer on earth.",1356739200,5,10643,4.726778924497555

This DVD captures her growth in the first year.  The HD quality is excellent.  My only fault of the performance is the audience is not the most enthusiastic of her tour last year. But, I'm not rating the audience.  I hope a DVD of this quality comes out with her silverscreen performance.  I'm happy with online video for most artists and performances.

For over 1 year Jackie Evancho's music has been the most requested music in my house; by my 5 year old. My wife and I are so glad to see that there is positive classical music out there that appeals to children...of all ages.  Jackie Evancho's vocals, pitch, and tone make her music well worth listening too.

This Blu-ray is well worth the extra few dollars; simply for the difference in clarity.  To bad a Blu-ray version was not released with the original release date of the album and DVD.  Should you be trying to decide between DVD or Blu-ray, always go with the higher definition.  You won't be disappointed.",1350777600,,733,4.507575757575758

I've even gone as far as to contact her management and ask them to bring her down under to Australia so we can experience her in person, but alas this is not going to happen for a while. What to do? Why the next best thing of course. Buy her DVD, and where is the best place to do that? Amazon. The whole procedure is so easy and the service is next to none. You can even pay for your item(s) using Paypal. What amazes me most about Amazon is that they seem to sell everything. Books, DVD's, CD's. I bought Jackie's CD through our local JB Hi-Fi Store but they said that the DVD was a little harder and that it would probably cost more than it was worth. Never fear say I. Amazon will have it and they did. When I first saw Jackie on AGT she was only 10 and I was blown away by the voice that came out of such a small frame. She sings in languages that I can't even begin to understand, and she sings with such conviction for one so young. I'd just like to say before I finish that Amazon is one of my preferred companies to deal with on line. Thank you very much.",1346284800,,1193,4.037974683544304

Well, there are so many nice comments about Jackie and her suberb quality of voice, what can I add? I LOVE music and if I were allowed to keep just one DVD/BluRay (from many ones of any style ranging from POP over Jazz to Classical), this would be the one!",1343088000,4,686,4.48

4674619,5,B005FI36OE,"Living in Europe, I discovered Jackie on You Tube by chance shortly before Christmas 2011. A physical CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-With-Me/dp/B004UB2WAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream With Me</a>&nbsp;couldn't be arrive in right time, so I bought at Amazon the MP3 downloads. The self burnt CD succeeded however perfectly. As I heard that the DVD has two extra records, I ordered it at Amazon and was prompt totally satisfied. My Philips BlueRay Player and Panasonic TV seem to be perfectly compatible with the DVD Records in both audio settings. To see Jackie in ""live"" makes the pleasure in her performances complete. Only by seeing her can you realize the miracle of her transformation from beautiful little girl to a totally professional superstar during her performance, and then again back to the little girl with the lovely smile. I won't chat about the whole repertoire on the disk, it is a beautiful selection. However, it is worth to tell some words to some of the songs. IMAGINER is a firework of emotions that Jackie could hardly experienced with her 11 years, even though perfectly transmitted to the audience. Amazing! A special praise deserves Conrad Tao with his virtuoso piano solo. LOVERS, her favourite number, is very imposing by seeing the symphonic orchestra completed with the Japanese drummers and the Chinese traditional instrumental trio. And finally to realize, that this whole pomp, crowned with David Foster on the piano serves only this little girl, who sings like a (Japanese/Chinese?) angel. SOMEWHERE, the big hit of the amazing Barbra Streisand! Who could come to the idea, that a duet could add something positive to the original performance? Well, Foster came to this idea, and he was right, Jackie could give an additional glance even to this song. Also the rendering was a masterpiece of Foster. OMBRA MAI FU, the most impressive example of Jackie's transforming ability from a horse-tailed pre-teen into a wonderful young lady, clothed by 200 years old fashion, whom you at last can believe that the huge and very beautiful voice is really hers! And finally NESSUN DORMA, after introducing this song David Foster lets Jackie alone on the stage, and she starts singing this very difficult aria completely relaxed with an air of supreme confidence and control. And her performance is absolutely perfect! On You Tube somebody wrote, that not even the great Sarah Brightman can touch this vocal performance. This song however, was written for male, tenor singers. I became curious, how sounds this song by the world's best tenors? I know, it is hardly to believe, but the result of my You Tube study is that Pavarotti, Domingo, Carreras, Jussi Bjoerling, Mario del Monaco, Giuseppe di Stefano all sound like quite good amateurs compared with Jackie, alone Benjamino Gigli delivered a really comparable performance. So don't hesitate, buy the DVD, you won't regret it. I have the CD in my car, and I can't find any reason to take off this DVD from my player!",1340409600,5,3049,5.199186991869919

What more could anyone want? We watched this Blu-Ray on very good equipment and we are blessed with good hearing.  What we heard was that most of the speaking done in this recording had a noticeable ""sibilance"".  But whenever Jackie sang you could barely hear any s-sounds in her voice.  It was not a shortcoming of our equipment or our ears, nor apparently was it this Blu-Ray disc.  SO, with such high standards present in Blu-Ray discs I must assume that this attenuation
of the real highs was intentional.  What were the producers afraid of?  Did they feel that Jackie's voice was too shrill (doubtful)?

4674655,5,B005FI36OE,"I can't add to the technical reviews already offered on this DVD/CD combo.

I don't typically buy music DVDs.  In fact this is the only one I own.  I buy movie DVDs and I buy music CDs, and I attend live performances, but normally I don't enjoy music DVDs enough to buy or watch them.  This one is special.  I watched my brother's DVD and went home and ordered my own copy from Amazon.  It came quickly and it was well worth it.

I am a fan of live opera and a limited fan of opera recorded on CDs, but this DVD is outstanding.  This child's voice is truly as good as it gets.  I have seen some of the best opera singers live including Joan Southerland and Placido Domingo.  None of their voices touched me like this girl's voice does.

That she is only 11 when she recorded this DVD should not mislead you.  She may look like a child and talk like a child, but she sings with the voice of a mature opera singer in her prime years.  Her stage presence is equally professional.  All in all this is an extremely high quality production and that it was recorded live makes it even more amazing.",1324684800,3,1091,4.1826923076923075

4674659,4,B005FI36OE,I HAVE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF JACKIE EVER SINCE I SAW HER AT AMERICAS GOT TALENT..I VOTED FOR HER TO WIN. IT IS WORTH HAVING THIS BLU RAY ADDED TO MY COLLECTION OF MUSIC VIDEO.. WONDERFUL JOB JACKIE..,1323820800,,196,4.051282051282051
4674660,5,B005FI36OE,"Even while you watch Jackie Evancho, age 11, standing there in this concert before a packed outdoor amphitheater, singing with the purest voice you may ever hear, it is all but impossible to believe.  When she debuted on America's Got Talent last year (at 10), you had to understand judge Howie Mandel's question to her after her first song:  ""Did you swallow a whole woman?""

Thankfully, she seems as unaffected and unspoiled now as then.  Toward the end of this concert (her first appearance DVD, third CD), producer David Foster asks how she can sing as easily as she seems to.  She smiles her sweet little-girl smile and says, ""Something just comes over me when I sing, and I feel very comfortable and happy.""  And that's what seems to be happening.  When she begins to sing, she is no longer a young girl; she becomes entirely a voice, more powerful than could ever come from a frail pre-adolescent form.  She becomes, simply, the music, as full in the alto range as in the highest soprano, with a perfect Italian vibrato in the opera numbers, and dramatic phrasing that is never hurried by nerves or overwhelmed by other voices or even the full orchestra around her.

It's said she began singing when she was presented with a recording of ""Phantom of the Opera""; and you can almost believe that she is similarly 'possessed', singing with a whole-hearted immersion in the music that cannot be taught or faked.  I gave the DVD to my son's family this Christmas.  My granddaughters are 11 and 13, and I wanted them to see what a youngster can do when she gives herself over to something she loves.  On the sheet of acknowledgements enclosed, she thanks her family and those responsible for the production of that concert.  Absent is any mention of a voice coach.  I'm not surprised; what she does cannot be taught.

Jackie's last number in this concert is Pucchini's ""Nessun Dorma"".  When David Foster introduces the number, he comments that most people feel a person must be at least 30 to sing opera, and that most singers of ""Nessun Dorma"" have been men.  Indeed, I heard Andrea Bochelli sing it as his curtain call in his Central Park concert.  I love Bochelli; but you know what?  Jackie sings that dramatic aria with even more power and soul.  May she sing that way forever!",1323734400,5,2283,4.66
4674661,5,B005FI36OE,"In this day and age in which we live one could easily ask if anything this beautiful and innocent and powerful could come from our corrupted culture. Miss Evancho herself says in the concert that she is overtaken by a power greater than herself when she sings and that really is the only logical explanation of where this innocence, power and beauty comes from. My eyes were filled with tears during most of her performance. The setting among beautiful artwork and with beautiful accompaniment is truly fitting for such a beautiful creation that seems to come from the love of God himself. What a privilege and honor to sit and listen and weep as heaven is opened to us for this short time.",1322784000,4,690,4.617886178861789
4674662,5,B005FI36OE,"I saw the ""Dream With Me Concert"" PBS special on Jackie Evancho and was very impressed with her vocal performance, poise, and musicality and was pleased that Amazon offered it so that I could add it to my DVD collection. The Ringling Museum is a perfect setting for this young musician's PBS debut. The pairing up of Jackie with David Foster has been miraculous. I love the music that was selected. Very unique and wonderful. The melodies are beautiful and so well suited to her vocal capabilities. The orchestral arrangements are beautiful and add so much to her outstanding performance.

4674665,5,B005FI36OE,"In my lifetime,I've seldom been so moved as I was when I saw this concert for the first time. Miss Evancho has the uncanny ability to put people into emotional states that are difficult to describe. Like a strange hodge-podge of sentiments;like several types of Love flowing at you all at once. You can see the enraptured,almost dazed looks on peoples faces in the audience. She regularly moves people to tears. Her fans adore her. I wish her the best.",1322438400,3,452,4.6625
4674666,5,B005FI36OE,"How fortunate I am to be living quite near Sarasota's Ringling Museum, where this DVD's performance takes place. This review is not meant to be travel ad so in one sentence I plead: One of the MUST DOs in this life is to visit this spectacular museum in this beautiful town. That being said; yes Jackie does it, her tender and exquisitely precise voice makes me cry. There is an etheral element that occurs when you view her singing. It takes at least a few seconds to realize that THIS voice is coming from this pretty little girl. I yes like all but only love half of the compositions. American Idol's judges common trite response""...you could sing the phone book.."" is related to my feelings on this. In pop music the song, the composition is most important aspect. But when you hear Jackie's voice, nothing else matters. On the included interview she admits to a 'force taking over when she delivers a performance'...something worth to ponder. This DVD will make at least 2 Christmas gift receipients of mine full of joy this year.",1322352000,2,1035,4.66120218579235

I've never been (and never will be) a fan of Barbara Striesand or Sarah Brightman but I love Jackie Evancho.

As I told my brother after stumbling upon this concert on PBS - I felt that I had just found the most perfect creature the universe had ever produced. While I'm looking forward to what she'll accomplish in the future, if I had the power to, I would freeze her here and now. She'll never again be this combination of talent, beauty and innocence which I believe is what makes her so precious to so many. She's an absolute treasure.",1322092800,6,757,4.149659863945578

There will never be another Jackie Evancho, and this disc proves it. The production by David Foster et al is outstanding in its selections, and brings out Jackie's definitive interpretations of each song in her repertoire. She is a lyric soprano of amazing maturity. Seeing and hearing her here is a privilege and a moving American event. The piano passages in ""Imaginer"" by Conrad Tao are beautifully played, and Jackie's ""duet"" with Barbra Streisand is memorable.

I personally believe she is a National Treasure and do pray that she continues to grow in her faith thru her family's guidence and enjoy her childhood.  Her voice can only get stronger and sweeter.

4674681,4,B005FI36OE,"Ever since I heard this child with the voice of a mature diva on AGT I was hooked.  I liked Susan Boyle and bought her CD but her voice and talent pale when you listen to Jackie Evancho.  It's spooky to think that someone so young can be as pitch perfect as she is and carry the talent that she does.  I hope her parents guide her with grace and dignity and she does not burn her out or take a misstep and become a train wreck like so many young artists do in this 24/7 world.

As for this CD it's great but it would have been much better with a different producer.  The first number was Wish Upon A Star and it is a bad lead because it does not allow her to show her voice as well as many others songs that she has done.  It must have been included to have something that related to the fact that she is only 11 years old.  If the song had to be included it should have been the last one.

I could have done without the duets with Susan Boyle and Barbra Streisand.  I've listened to this CD four or five times a day since acquiring it and have not tired of hearing her sing although admittedly I will sometimes skip Upon A Star and the duets.

It was money well spent and I look forward to her future CDs.  It's still difficult to believe that there were so many lame minds watching AGT last year that they voted her runner up to a country boy and his CW/bluegrass.  Never underestimate the gullibility and stupidity of the American consumer.",1319932800,5,1443,4.096085409252669

4674688,5,B005FI36OE,"Eleven year old Jackie Evancho is a conductor/producer ('s) dream come true. Blessed with perfect pitch, an amazing soprano range, the richest and warmest tones one can imagine in a soprano/mezzo soprano, Jackie can learn the lyrics to a song almost immediately, quickly pick up the intricate subtleties of foreign languages, and easily adapt to the needs of a conductor or producer on demand. Somehow, young Jackie picks up the emotions inherent in her songs, and transmits those emotions to her mesmerized audiences to standing ovations in concert after concert. And what other eleven year old can manage live concerts with ten or more songs without faltering or complaint? Yes, she has already given many live concerts to sellout crowds and standing ovations.

Having followed Jackie Evancho since her wonderful America's Got Talent performances, I eagerly looked forward to her PBS performance at the Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Florida, and what a performance it was. Amazing. PBS went beyond the norm and put on a beautiful, perhaps extravagant, production for a rising star eleven year old child. As an Andrea Bocelli/Pavarotti/Domingo/Brightman fan, I am used to excellent concerts in the classical crossover/operatic venue. But this performance was the finest I had ever viewed, in over fifty years of classical and operatic enjoyment. She was spectacular, with a splendid orchestra and conductor, beautiful sets, and excellent guest musicians.

When the Dream With Me In Concert came out in DVD, I immediately ordered three of the DVDs from Amazon with great expectations, and a BluRay copy also, and I was not disappointed. The quality of the DVDs was so much superior to the PBS TV broadcasts and there were extra songs added, that were dropped from the TV production because of time limitations. Of course some of these DVDs were purchased for gifts, and I am planning on ordering a few more. Incidentally, the BluRay copy is of excellent high definition quality and well worth the extra purchase. The DVD copies are improved in definition and clarity by my BluRay player on a 1080p HD screen, and I am very happy with them, as are my gift recipients. I have also purchased all of Jackie's albums (many for gifts), and downloaded over one hundred of her splendid YouTube performances.

Jackie's Dream With Me CD album is also an excellent gift idea, as is her O Holy Night album with AGT DVD included from 2010. Incidentally that holiday album went platinum in sales and is headed for double platinum, selling well through the summer. And she has a new holiday album, Heavenly Christmas, coming out November 1st. Having watched the Dream With Me In Concert DVD innumerable times, and having shared it many times with family and friends, I do believe it is my most prized possession.",1319414400,7,2796,5.021551724137931

I went to college at the Ringling School of Art and spent a lot of time at the Museum & Home. The camera work and lighting was spectacular, and Jackie's Angelic voice was never better. My wife and I have watched it several times, and it seems to better with each viewing! I highly recommend it!!",1318723200,5,490,4.51685393258427

4674696,5,B005FI36OE,"This is just wonderful. I already have Jackie's C.D. "" Dream with Me "" which is lovely, but watching her performing as well as hearing her gorgeous voice is even better. The warmth and passion which she puts into every song she sings has to be seen to be believed. I still cannot get over the fact that all of this lovely music is flowing from the throat of one little child.
  The D.V.D. is very well presented with interesting introductions and interviews. This will always be one of my treasures.

4674698,5,B005FI36OE,"Jackie Evancho has built up such an incredible following in the US and UK as a result of her success on the ""Got Talent"" shows that it isn't easy to get an opinion of her that has not been ""preconditioned"" by all the thoroughly well-deserved enthusiasm.
However, in much of continental Europe, she is relatively unknown - for the moment. We were therefore able to carry out an intriguing experiment. We organised a special session of the ""OperaDou Jury"" at our Home Opera Theatre in the South of France and did a ""blind test"", playing a couple of tracks from the CD and inviting the jury members to describe WHO they thought could possibly be singing with such amazing purity, perfect pitch and phrasing. The guesses were interesting, ranging from a 40-year-old (bald) countertenor to a choirboy or a mid-30s, amply proportioned, diva. We then showed the jury the ""Dream with Me Concert"" Blu-ray* (very efficiently shipped by amazon.com to arrive on October 5, the day after it was released in the US). They were therefore among the very first in Europe to see Jackie performing at that concert in full High Definition, on a 330 cm screen.
To say that they were blown away would be an understatement! In fact it was quite a shock that left some of them reeling, not knowing how to react. One or two even felt ""uncomfortable"" at the idea of such a perfectly mature voice coming from such a tiny frame. For some, it was quite a culture shock as well. You can check out all these fascinating reactions in detail for yourself by going to [...] or else Google ""operadou"" and go to the ""Jackie Evancho"" page.

The same is true for this DVD.  It is excellence par excellence. Beautifully done and perfect in every way. An incredible accomplishment for an eleven year old girl.  What is even more astounding is that she did it all from memory, primarily in Italian and French!  An unbelievable accomplishment.  Seeing her live, in concert, makes it even all the more astounding, watching and hearing this tiny little girl belt out, in perfect pitch, an entire performance.

She is honest, sincere and overwhelms you with the many subtleties of her voice from low to high tones. I actually hate opera but for some reason, she is special and I am at a loss to really try to explain why. I guess you have to see and hear it for yourself. P.S.

I never tire of watching Jackie deliver a performance that is so far beyond her years that it defies description, and then, upon completing a song, she almost immediately reverts back to the little girl she is, as if a switch has been turned on and off. It's simply beyond my comprehension, that's for sure.

The future for this Wonderchild will be filled with worldwide adoration, limosines, private jets, and sparkling diamonds and she deserves it all a thousand times over for the sheer joy she spreads to everyone within earshot of her extraordinary talent. I cannot wait for her to appear in concert in the area where I live as I will be one of the first to buy a ticket regardless of the price. I have become so overwhelmed with emotion at the sound of her voice that I find myself thinking ""Now I understand what Beetlemania was all about!""  I wonder if Jackie realizes thet her voice can bring people to tears simply from it's overwhelming beauty and purity. Has she noticed members of her audience tearing up?  It can't be only me who has this reaction based on some of the other reveiws I've read.  What a beautiful gift she has given the world.

I am sure that seeing her in person is even that much better.

If your not sure that you are or could be a fan, please buy this DVD first.  You will quickly be hooked and then you can buy all of the CDs.

If your a fan then this DVD is a MUST HAVE.  Even when just watching the DVD it is so easy to connect with Jackie's performance and to get drawn into the song.  Many people have described this connection is so many ways (much better then I) but to me it is just simply a miracle.

4674717,5,B005FI36OE,"Dream with Me in Concert - Just Incredible.  It is the most beautifully performed collection of music you will hear in a long time (or until Jackie's next performance).  This is not a performance by an exceptional child singer, but a world class performance by a singer who just happens to be a child.
I got this DVD on Tuesday and have played it at least 10 times; it is out of this world beautiful by a talent that will only come along once in (my) lifetime.  This is the first time l had seen this PBS Great Performances Show (do not think it was shown in Arizona in June but may be wrong).  The setting and production is outstanding; shot in April at the beautiful Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Florida the week that Jackie turned 11 years (yes 11).
This collection will inspire all ages and is very diverse in taste and genres, but each performed in such a wonderful way by this amazing girl.  The mentorship and interactions with the great David Foster were nice touches; you can tell he  admires her.  Of note were the touching homage to Jackie's parents and her uncle Matt, who were in the audience at the beginning of the inspiring ""To Believe"" that had a child backing choir.  This piece was composed by her uncle.  The performance of ""Dark Waltz"" will be new to most viewers as it was not on the CD Dream with Me or performed during the summer shows.  It was a hauntingly beautiful song.  The finale performance of ""Nessum Dorma"" was breathtaking.  As David Foster prefaced, this is usually a ""man's song"" but l can say that Jackie's performance is the best l have ever heard (even when compared to Pavarotti).  When you consider this is from an 11 year old girl, this is more amazing.
I was lucky to catch Jackie's live performances in Chicago and Dallas; these were wonderful but now just memories, this DVD performance will be there when the memories have faded.  Catch a live show if you can but buy this DVD; you will not regret it.  It deserves 10 stars.  Can not wait for the new Christmas CD due l believe early November.",1316304000,10,2039,4.455525606469003
4674718,5,B005FI36OE,"I received my DVD from Amazon this morning and it has been playing all day. I have seen the PBS special before and this dvd has the addition of ""To Believe"" and ""Mi Mancherai"". Jackie will take you to the 18 century with her haunting version of ""Dark Waltz"" with only Mr Foster on the piano and Conrad on violin, which is only on this dvd. Bonus is the Jackie and David interview and slideshow of beautiful Jackie singing ""Dream with Me"". ""Mi Mancherai"" probably because first time I've seen this makes me wonder, has Jackie been in love before??.  It so emotional the way she sang this..""Imaginer"" another beautiful and powerful song.. Before I get carried away about reviewing this DVD in which I am not good at, buy it and decide for youself...I am more than 100% sure you will love this...I still have to wait for the BluRay version. I want the best because Jackie is the best!!!!!!!
(09/23/2011)After watching this, I concluded this DVD was made for kids and the young at heart, who love the circus. There were NO tigers, lions, clowns nor flying trapezze.
Uncle David will give you a tour, Ringling Museum Of Arts, with Jackie. You will see the ""Calliope"" musical instrument, you will recognize it when you hear it, a big human canon, where a woman is used as the bullet, you'll be amazed the woman survives, a hall where great paintings by the great painter Reubens are displayed and you will wonder which one you like. A hall where great opera singers were invited to sing and you will see how Jackie looked like during the 18th century. In between tours, Jackie will entertain you with her beautiful voice. You will see Jackie with a chorus of children on the song ""To Believe"". Also you will see Jackie's friends and classmates watching the concert. And the fireworks at the end....Amazing....
10/12/2011  Received my Bluray yesterday...I am so impressed of the quality of the video and the sound..The closest thing of being there ""live"".

I have watched it now 3 times in a row...the last time without interruption.  I am so overcome by her grace and beauty and ability that I am at a loss of words to describe what I see.  She is so far beyond normality that I do not know what to say.  All I can say is just listen and be mesmerized by the only angel on earth that I know.  Perhaps she is the reincarnation of Jenny Lind and it is about time that we had someone with that vocal ability to turn us all in quiverings masses of jelly.

4674721,5,B005FI36OE,"Hearing Jackie Evancho sing just about anything is an exquisite and sublime experience. Actually watching her perform increases the enjoyment to a level of divine ecstasy. Miss Evancho is a once in a lifetime performer with such a high degree of talent that it boggles the mind. Like most people, I discovered Jackie Evancho when she burst onto the scene last summer on America's Got Talent. Unless you've been living under a rock since then, you know that her career has exploded over the past year. She's had two chart-topping albums (one gone platinum and the other, gold), dozens of television appearances, sold out concerts, and much more, all while remaining the sweet-natured, loving, articulate, unspoiled, family-first little girl that we all fell in love with last summer.

I obtained a copy of this DVD several weeks ago by donating $100 to a public television station while the concert was airing on PBS. I thought it might eventually be released for sale, but I didn't want to take that chance. Please trust me on this one. It was worth every penney I paid, and much more. This disc contains a priceless collection of live performances by Jackie Evancho that you will treasure for the rest of your life. The production value is very high. The musical accompaniment is outstanding. The singing is - well - the singing is beyond normal human comprehension. Watching Jackie wrap her entire being around a song and express herself from the depths of her soul is a privilege and a pleasure that should not be denied. There must be a special place in the cosmos from which beauty and grace arise to give life hope and greater meaning. Jackie Evancho must have emerged fully formed from that place. She is a gift from the universe that we should accept with open and grateful arms.",1316044800,23,1787,4.783171521035599

I immediately recognized that she was the most phenomenal vocal prodigy of our time.  Perhaps of all time.  As he mentions, one of the reasons I'm a huge fan is that she doesn't sing like a child.  In fact, I'm such a fan that I was one of the significant funders of her first album and yet I am far from rich and have never contributed to any artist before.  I was just so struck by her talent that I knew she, more than any artist I've ever seen or heard, deserved to be given a hand up.  I will admit that I didn't dream of how quickly and hugely her star would rise.  I just knew in my gut that she was a true genius and phenomenon.

I also relate to Ehkzu's statement that it's better if people hear her without seeing her first.  When my father played The Lord's Prayer at his 80th birthday party for dinner and the MC mentioned that she was 11 (actually she was 10 at the time she sang it), the audience applauded but I just knew they were visualizing some exceptionally large, physically mature, adult looking 11-year-old! :)  I wish I'd had time to play part of her DVD but unfortunately I was too busy DJing :)",1315526400,7,1269,4.142857142857143

The performance was unbelievable and was Jackie's finest performance to date , even though you wouldn't think of it with the luke warm reception Jackie receives from the largely senior citizen audience that was brought in to see her.

With today's technology it pays to DVR a performance such as this , for exactly this reason . Not that I am a cheap skate , but more because , if I can get something for free(Not when you pay to get a signal these days )why should you pay for something that you already saw or own on your DVR .

Now on the other hand , I would pay for something that I did not see . I would pay if I saw one of Jackie's 4 other summer concerts(The ones where people paid to see Jackie , because they are Jackie Fans). The ones that were conveniently left off YOUTUBE. The same ones that most Jackie fans , logon to Youtube to see if there is a glimpse of seeing one of Jackie's new performances.

If you will have a chance to see the PBS special on TV , I would suggest not to buy this DVD and just DVR it .If you missed it , by all means buy it . If you want to help support Jackie buy it .

To bad they they won't put the upcoming performance in Lincoln Center on DVD (Maybe they will , who knows) , instead of this. It would of made more sense .",1315180800,2,1348,3.9267399267399266

The sound she makes, when she sings, is beyond description. It causes feelings inside me that no other singer has in my life, and I am 63 years old and have herd all the great singers in my lifetime.

4674730,5,B005FI36OE,"Okay, here's another 5-star review, joining what will soon be hundreds of five-star reviews for this DVD. But I realize that even if a thousand reviewers give this DVD five stars, that's no guarantee that you will love it. So in this review I'd like to help you decide whether this DVD is for you--or not.

It's an interesting question because while Ms. Evancho's appeal reaches fans of many musical genres, that's also true for those who won't enjoy this DVD.

Judging from contributors to many music forums, fans of Classical Crossover are most likely to appreciate this DVD. Classical Crossover is music drawn from many sources--popular, musical theater, folk, classical, opera--performed in a classical manner. People who mostly like pop music sometimes mistake this for singing operatically, but opera singers generally sing without a mic and learn to project their voices over a pit orchestra to fill an auditorium. CC singers don't do this, even when they sing opera arias. They use a softer, more intimate sound that has to be mic'd in a concert hall.

Before Ms. Evancho burst on the scene, the biggest CC stars were folks like Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, Sarah Brightman, Hayley Westenra, Celtic Woman, the Canadian Tenors, and Charlotte Church. If you like them you're likely to like Ms. Evancho. Ditto New Age singers like Enya.

However, because of her quiet intensity and total sincerity, Ms. Evancho also has fans from genres as unlikely as Heavy Metal, Jazz, Country, and World Music.

You're least likely to appreciate Ms. Evancho's DVD if you don't like her ""classical"" sound and/or you only like one genre, such as Rock & Roll, or Jazz, or Country, or--surprisingly--Opera. If you only like one genre, instead of hearing what Ms. Evancho is doing with the music, you may only hear what she isn't doing with it--namely performing it the way singers in your favored genre normally perform it.

Take the first song on the DVD: ""When you wish upon a star,"" from the Walt Disney film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinocchio-Two-Disc-70th-Anniversary-Platinum-Edition/dp/B001ILFUDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition)</a>. In the movie it's sung by Disney regular Cliff Edwards (who also provides Jiminy Cricket's voice in the film, with the typical girls singers ooohing in the background. Key word: sentimental.

Ms. Evancho's rendition is unsentimental. She treats it as seriously as if it were an aria from a Handel opera (more on that later). Her pacing and the phrasing invite you to take in every word as great aspirational poetry, even though in any other performance of this song the lyrics seem kind of sappy. She doesn't seem to have an ironic bone in her body, but neither does she have a cutsey-poo one. Look at her singing. You can tell she means it. She doesn't play to the camera; she doesn't mug or simper or dimple at you. She waves her arms as she sings, but it looks less like she's doing something for the viewer than that she's simply conducting herself.

I've seen a lot of singers singing in a lot of genres, and the greatest of every genre share this trait with Ms. Evancho: when they sing they're ""inside the music.""

Music professors have said Ms. Evancho shows no signs of unusual physical equipment. Her larynx looks like a normal 11 year old's larynx. Ditto her lungs and everything else. They said what's different about her is her brain. She hears music with a depth few others can achieve, and that depth combines with a nearly unique ability to express her musical ideas with every aspect of her physical equipment. Sports docs call this somatic integration, and Ms. Evancho has a kind of this integration, just as an elite gymnast does.

So if you buy this DVD of an 11 year old girl singing, don't expect to hear a child singer. Because she doesn't sound like any other child singer. She sounds like a 30 year old professional singer at the top of her game. Not in every aspect of technique, but certainly in the most crucial aspects of her art: perfect pitch, great transitions from chest to head voice (called passagio), great (and greatly restrained) note-bending (called portamento), great tone (assuming you like a classical, adult tone), and above all, great emotional connection with the listener.

This is why I didn't list fans of child singers as one of the groups most likely to appreciate this DVD. She sounds so unlike other children singing that some actually find it disconcerting. They'll claim she's been taught to do this (she hasn't), or that she's damaging her voice (she isn't, according to voice experts who examine her regularly), or that it's freakish. I attribute this to those who can't accept the fact that some humans are geniuses. They seem to believe that all human differences are due to environment/experience. This is a folk belief--no reputable behavioral scientist would agree. And Ms. Evancho's existence is the proof of the pudding. Her extreme talent even shows in You Tube performances of her at age 8, singing acapella in her living room.

Then as now, when she sings you believe her. Not that she has personally experienced everything she sings about (which includes drug addiction, suicide, mad love and more), but as a wise storyteller who can take you into the story of the song with her.

I should add that in many forum entries I've read about her, people also agree that seeing her perform adds a lot. It doesn't hurt that she's a pretty child with great stage presence, but honestly, there are lots of children just as pretty, with just as much stage presence.

What's different is seeing her skip onto the stage, looking every inch like an ordinary 11 year old child--and then, at the moment she starts to sing, seeing the musical genius inside her suddenly appear, only to vanish just as abruptly as she finishes the song. Ms. Evancho herself says, in effect, that this whatever-it-is possesses her when she's singing.

The irony is that she herself doesn't hear what we hear. She has stated in interviews that when she sings she just hears an 11 year old girl singing. Nothing special. I don't think this is false modesty. It's more that to a genius, what they're a genius at comes so naturally to them they don't see it as something special. It's hard for them to imagine it not coming to everyone just as easily. Instead they admire people whose genius is expressed in areas where they themselves are not geniuses.

So far I've just talked about her singing. But this DVD captures a performance with an orchestra, featuring the arrangements of David Foster. And while her renditions are straight ahead, her accompaniments on this DVD tend towards the ""Wall of Sound"" David Foster treatment, with swelling orchestras and choruses at every turn. Many will find this very appealing and professional; others will find it overdone--""gilding the lily.""

Personally I lean toward the ""overdone"" reaction, but it's not so much as to ruin my pleasure at listening to her. So may I suggest to those who also would like more restraint in her musical settings, David Foster's treatment may be what's required t0 launch her career to the broadest musical audience. Her ""Dream with me"" CD, with the same treatment and many of the same songs, just went Gold. No other Classical CD of any sort has enjoyed anywhere near that success lately.

If I had my druthers she'd be doing a more classically focused repertoire, with more like her performance of Handel's ""Ombra mai fu"" on this DVD. But I'm certain such a CD/DVD would also garner far fewer sales, and since she can't tour like adults can--she still has at least seven years of childhood ahead of her--she's more dependent on CD sales than an adult. And she needs the sales because her father had to close his security system franchise to support her career, while her parents also need to parent her three siblings as well as her. And the profit margins on CDs and DVDs are much slimmer than for concerts.

So for the time being, her music needs to be as broadly focused as possible. Relatively sophisticated listeners should accept this with good grace. There aren't enough of such listeners to keep Ms. Evancho's career going successfully. Plus, arranger/producer David Foster has done a lot for Ms. Evancho, helping her and her family learn how to navigate the jungle of the music industry, so all of Ms. Evancho's fans owe David Foster a debt of gratitude, even if some would like him to ease up on the accompaniments sometimes.

I imagine that most people who are reading this review have seen the PBS special it's based on, recorded at the Ringling Brothers' estate in Florida. You may not know that this audience was not a paying audience, but rather was mostly Ringling employees roped into making up an audience. Consequently their reactions are more muted than those at her ""real"" performances, in which she normally gets prolonged, standing ovations after every song. She really does move many people profoundly, and it would be hard to find a performer who'd more cared-about by fans than her. This isn't like ""Biebermania"" and its ilk. It's something altogether different, and Ms. Evancho's fans are mostly people who aren't and haven't been active fans of any other performer.

As I've said, people's reactions to Ms. Evancho can be complicated by the fact that she's still a child. Let me suggest that when you get this DVD, don't play it for people you want to introduce to Ms. Evancho. Instead, play a song from her CD ""Dream with me"" without revealing anything about her. I've done this repeatedly, and each time I've asked them to describe who they see in their mind's eye. Usually it's a tall (to support the big voice) professional singer in her late 20s or 30s (to support the maturity of her interpretation). Then their jaw drops when I show them one of the performances on this DVD.

Those of us who are worldly (I've traveled in 17 countries, for example), musically sophisticated, and more than a little skeptical about politics and a lot else besides, might be predisposed to reject the music of an 11 year old soprano out of hand. You'll be making a big mistake if you do in this case. Nearly every ""child singer"" I've heard before Ms. Evancho made me think ""OK, fine--I'll listen again after you grow up."" This is different. I've listened to opera singer Beverly Sills and also Julie Andrews as 11 year olds, and while their voices are more agile than Ms. Evancho's they can't hold a candle to her emotional connection and gorgeous sonorities. I don't believe there's one other singer I've heard at Ms. Evancho's age who can compete for your music dollars against the best adult professionals, if you listen to both without giving Ms. Evancho any kind of special consideration due to her youth.

She's that good.",1313798400,446,10875,4.87919826652221
4674731,5,B005FI36OE,"I didn't watch America's Got Talent, so I was unfamiliar with Jackie.  The PBS Great Performances aired recently and it was on my TV, although I was in another room.  I heard this absolutely beautiful voice singing and after 2 minutes or so, walked to the TV to see who possessed this angelic voice.  Needless to say, I was floored.  I couldn't believe that this music was actually coming from a little girl, a very beautiful little girl.  The power, the range and the richness of her voice is, I believe, unmatched.

If she were an adult, I would still buy this DVD, but her being only 11 makes it all the more interesting.  What will the young woman sound like when she's 16?  25?  I can't wait to hear.

I think one of the most interesting aspects of being able to watch her (rather than listen to the CD) is that you can see that she is almost possessed by the music.  While many singers sing to the audience, Jackie seems to sing to something higher, almost like she's allowing the music of heaven to come through her. And after the last note, that beautiful 11 year old girl smile returns.

This is a talent without peer.  I almost feel privileged just to see and hear her.",1313625600,70,1179,4.353211009174312
