7486331,3,B01723F80E,"Inoffensive. And that is a shame. It is an origin story with a good set-up for a series of sequels, it is not clear if we'll ever get those sequels, however. The odd thing about this film is there is nothing bad about it, but, alas there is also nothing great about it either. I really wanted to like this film and some of the plot points were interesting but nothing too surprising. I still want to like this movie. Hopefully it'll do well enough on DVD/Blu-Ray to spawn a better sequel, the elements are certainly there, but this film played it too safe.",1452556800,,556,4.355769230769231
7486332,5,B01723F80E,"loved the movie, great special effects, excellent storyline. loved john snows girlfriend in this movie. she is one goo looking redhead. all the acting was great. lots of action of course with vin in the movie.",1452556800,,209,4.833333333333333
7486333,4,B01723F80E,"Say what you want of Diesels acting, but the guy picks solid genre movies. This films world building is both ambitious and admirable, crafting a different urban fantasy-horror universe than has been typically shown onscreen, one where magic is alive albeit underground. In that regard, the movie is like a grownup Harry Potter or Buffy.

The intro in the past is sublime, starting with a group of grizzled warriors journeying to slay the vile witch queen that has cursed the countryside. Their epic first encounter is akin to the classic first shootout in Aliens, a scene of palpable suspense and terror as man first meets monster.

Once the story jumps into the present, the story falls into a sillier mess of clichs. The immortal hero could have a very interesting personality or complex perspective on life, yet here he is unfortunately turned into the same sarcastic badass that is a retread from any old underwritten Stallone role. Diesels generally leaden delivery doesnt help differentiate the character much either.

Thankfully, there is still a lot of great action with some good scares, a solid supporting cast, and ample FX ranging from colorful monsters, wild spells to fanciful set design. The story might be corny or predictable at points, but it still has a lot of fun for the right fans of unapologetic action.",1450310400,149,1326,4.963963963963964

7486335,3,B01723F80E,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Last Witch Hunter""

1. This is what I call a WYSIWYG movie - What You See Is What You Get. The trailer gave a pretty accurate idea of what to expect.

2. It's the latest in the long line of 'immortal hunter' genre movies, like ""Blade""and ""Underworld"". In this one, witches live hidden among us regular humans. Vin Diesel is an immortal human, haunted by his past, who hunts down renegade witches that want to end the truce with humans and start a war. Blah blah blah.

3. The movie doesn't spend much energy on making an original or smart story - it's the same thing we've seen over and over.

4. Where the movie succeeds is the visuals. It's shot well and the computer effects are pretty impressive.

5. Elijah Wood plays Vin Diesels's sidekick, a nerdy priest in New York City. I really like Elijah, but this movie was a step down for his career. I'm confused as to why he decided to make this movie.

6. The movie was directed by Breck Eisner. His last film was the pretty decent remake of ""The Crazies"". But Eisner also directed ""Sahara"", one of the biggest financial disasters in Hollywood history.

7. Parts of the movie look and feel like a video game.

8. This movie is aimed at super geeks and teenagers, so if you can relate to one of those groups, you'll enjoy it well enough. Besides, you can't hate a movie that has flaming swords, underground witch clubs, and gummy bear trees.

9. This is not a bad movie. But it's also not a good movie. It's not a waste of time, but it's also not one that you will remember for long.",1448409600,110,1566,4.335616438356165
7486336,5,B01723F80E,"I just saw TLWH and Wow!!  Great actors, good plot and a twist at the end O'Henry style!  Special effects were great too!  I liked seeing Vin Diesel in fantasy mode in a past/modern world.  Great action and good fun - Teens and adults would like this.  I'm 59, and I was hooked! I read later that Vin is a fantasy gamer and came up with this movie.  AND they're making 2 & 3!!!  I'm not a gamer, but now am wondering what I've been missing LOL.  Just wish they had turned this movie into a book so we could get more background on the characters, their lives, etc.  All in all, I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  Thanks Vin Diesel :) - you've added another great character in Kaulder along with Riddick and Dom - yeah!!! :)",1446940800,16,721,4.085714285714285
7486337,1,B01723F80E,"Let's only hope the title is a definitive as to the future of this franchise.  It is stale, poorly acted, predictable fare that is sorely lacking in any thrills and far less frightening than the actual money spent for ticket and concessions to watch this newest Vin Diesel vehicle crash and burn.  Even when the so-called twists are revealed, they are met with only ho-hums and yawns.  The action sequences are so badly filmed and abruptly edited that most of the elaborate effects are lost in translation.  And does Caine owe some massive back taxes or something, as it seems he has been co-starring in too many features, of late, that are well below his caliber.  Also, as unfortunate as it may be, poor Wood will not be able to appear in any film without me pining for happier days spent in the Shire.  The only magic in this flick is how effectively it made my interest and any and all entertainment value disappear.  0 out of 5 Kernels: as far as Vin Diesel's acting prowess is concerned, better stick to lines that truly express his true range, like ""I am Groot.""",1446940800,6,1069,4.536458333333333
7486338,4,B01723F80E,"During the Great Plague Kaulder (Vin Diesel) and company go after the Witch Queen  (Julie Engelbrecht) in order to kill her and break the curse. Kaulder in turn gets the ""curse of immortality."" We then switch to modern times where Kaulder is an infamous witch hunter known as ""The Weapon."" He works with a group of priests known as the ""Axe and Cross."" They have a fragile truce with the witch's council. Kaulder has a handler with the title Dolan. When Dolan 36 (Michael Caine) retires and suddenly dies, Kaulder suspects ""dark magic beyond evil.""

The film didn't have enough display as to the magic types and rules. We are told that the magic is elemental, but most of what we saw deviated from that. With vampires, we know the rules. With witches, things must be developed if you are going to have a whole underground culture. The film had some good scenes and lines, but relied on long dragged out special effects to sell itself. Vin Diesel is always good in these roles and he didn't disappoint.

Guide: Filmed in Pittsburgh (I couldn't figure out the city from the skyline). No sex or nudity. I remember one bitch. Not much in swearing as I recall.",1446854400,70,1155,4.597087378640777

The film is a continual set of confrontations between the good guys and bad guys. There are very few twists or turns; well there may be a surprise or two, but nothing un anticipated.

This looks like it was designed to be the beginning of a series, so do not look for a fairytale ending.

She doesnt quite succeed as humanity is made of stronger stuff and because Kaulder (Vin Diesel) has a fiery sword that immediately puts a crimp in her plans.  In return, the mean witch gives Kaulder an odd punishmenteternal life.  Fast forward eight hundred years and Kaulder is a superhero of sorts, keeping witches in line.  There is an uneasy truce between humans and witches.  Not every witch intends to keep the bargain.  Now the very mean witch is back and there is hell to pay!

Critics panned this movie and low turnout at the box office killed any chance of it becoming a franchise, as planned.

7486464,2,B01723F80E,"I'm really not sure how this movie got 4 stars. If I could it would get 2 1/2. What was good about the movie was the CGI, and special effects. They were very well done. The plot had some merit but wasn't inspired, in hollywood terms it was pretty formulaic. The front of the movie played well, drove suspension of disbelief and was engrossing. The latter half felt rushed, VERY CLICHED, confusing and unbelievable. Almost the entire movie starred Vin with supporting actors Elijah Wood and Michael Caine getting nearly zero character development or screen time. This left Vin delivering all the lines counter to the supporting actress Rose Leslie. The interaction between them was sub-par and felt hokey/forced, really just poor acting. The main antagonist, the ""Witch Queen"" was underdeveloped and at times laughable. At the end of the day it is just above passable, had I paid money to see this in theaters I would have been irritated. If you are looking for a good culty romp like Underworld or a revisit to Hogwarts it completely misses by trying to combine both. It isn't gritty enough to really feel for Vin's character when he is winning, nor does it take the time to keep you engrossed with the magical aspect of witchcraft.

In my opinion, this movie could have used a sequel or been a trilogy with more character development and draw into the fabled world. Maybe ditch Vin as the lead then. (Don't get me wrong he has movies that I love him in, but this was out of his range.) Who knows...?",1502150400,,1500,4.639097744360902

7486484,3,B01723F80E,"Very odd movie. While adequate as an action movie, it seemed to be all over the place, all too often relying on explosions and action to cover up a poor story, below-average acting and head-scratching casting.

Started out well enough, setting the story and Kaulder's role. Michael Caine's character...OK. But with the addition of Rose Leslie and Elijah Wood it just got worse and worse. Two actors I don't dislike. Leslie is excellent in GoT and Wood is very good in other movies I've seen him in. But here? They were both so out of place and so lacking in their acting and chemistry with Diesel. Maybe that was poor writing or direction but, Elijah Wood especially seemed really out of place in this movie.

And was I the only one who felt absolutely ZERO chemistry between Rose Leslie and Diesel? Out of the forced one liners (we expect that in Vin Diesel movies, so no big deal there...just roll your eyes and move on), nothing was more forced than the love interest/flirtation between these two.

The last 20 minutes of this movie really dropped the ball in every aspect.",1500336000,,1076,4.652631578947369

There's no historical lore backing it up, and so they just make things up to suit their plot needs and entertainment values.  BAH!  Any rule could be broken for no reason, and even the film itself lacked consistency here and there.  The CGI was just not enough to carry the story, and that's because the story was as mish mashy as everything else about the work.  Yet still, four stars were earned by professionalisms expected given the budget.  Future me, this film just is boring -- twice now.  Find something else to watch.",1499126400,,689,4.590163934426229

I liked the movie itself and the storyline. The characters, well, some decent development but probably could have been a bit better. No matter, it's a good Sci-Fi Fantasy to enjoy. The picture and audio are wonderful, the effects are great, too, for a movie of this type.
There were some good fight scenes as usual. Vin shows us why he makes a good ""Witch Hunter""
The ""Queen"" looks like a Witch in every way and pretty evil at that. Michael Caine plays Vin's Preacher friend.

Now that were past that, I love the actor's portrayal. Every person on screen performs their role excellently. Vin Diesel is a bad-ass, that girl warms up to him and starts kicking ass, and even ""Frodo""(I'm certain hes from Lord of the Rings) fills his niche perfectly. The only knock I can conceive, is the script for the movie could be more inventive. If we forgive the story for its basic magical roots, then this movie may even rival ""Riddick""

I always loved the 'Urban Fantasy' genera (even before 'Harry Potter' happened). I think this is a reminder this it is still there.

People should stop complaining about Vin Diesel's acting. He knows it and is staying in places where it's not really needed. This isn't 'Silence of the Lambs'",1489968000,,523,4.5638297872340425

7486557,5,B01723F80E,"Ok how do I do this without reviling too much of the movie...I had basically no knowledge beyond that people believed in witches and they had certain powers/spells/magic....I watched the movie times in one week. I loved the movie the first time so I wanted to see it again. But the first time I thought that (all the words for different powers, or different spells or magic, and pretty much all the worlds I didn't understand and have never heard before) were bade up. During my second time I started looking them up and every single word or power, and every specific ability certain witches had were all based on real words and actual things that people practiced and believed in in ancient history and to this day. Not to say that I believe in it but I was amazed that everything was based on realistic and historical events that occurred.(in general, not the storyline itself but all the powers, witchcraft practices, spells, etc) So I watched it a third time and not I was able to pick like 30% of the things in the movie that I never understood or noticed. It made the movie so much deeper and more amazing. By the fourth time I noticed even the smallest details and how one thing replaced another and that is how the  witch queen returned where the simple form just showed that her heart was saved and he thought it was destroyed...her powers and  sacred most powerful tools she used 800 yrs ago to cast a spell to destroy humanity, were all destroyed, The witch queen reborn did not have the power to destroy humanity, but it was his own kind that hid the secret from him that the heart wasn't destroyed since it might have caused him to die or lose his immortality, and they gathered all the deadliest and most powerful witches over 800 yrs in this mythical creature/witch prison that he caug. She would release them and combine all their powers to destroy the world. Or she might not succeed lol...But there is so much more to the movie that I understood by the fourth time which made it extremely fascinating. And I never beleved nor watched any witch movies...But this one I watched 4 times in one week and will probably watch it again from time to time.....I have reached the point where I pretty much loved the story and understood it fully and watched 4 times and it was great every time but there is no interest for me to watch it again right away like before...But I thing 4 times in one week and loving it every time deserves 10 stars and not 5...Anyhow, if you don't understand the words and the history, you are likely to miss a lot of things that happened and you will not understand the things you didn't miss and it could very well be a 2-3 stars for you...This movie was so deep that a lot of people won't realize that and thing it was superficial and based on complete fiction and they might not like that at all...but boy or boy how fooled they are...and lets face it, most people are not educated about witches and the history and I wasn't either.

7486612,4,B01723F80E,"My teenagers and I watched it this weekend. We went into it without any expectation other than I expected a Vin Diesel movie to deliver some action. I wasn't disappointed.

OVERVIEW: Diesel is currently immortal and hunts witches (similar to Blade hunting vampires). In this current day and age witches have a secret society that live in peace (due to a treaty) with humans. Then things go awry and Diesel has to go mess up all kinds of witches.

+ Action sequences were entertaining shot well

+ Colors, cinematrography and various camera/CGI shots were done well and directed well

+ There is a little bit of backstory as a big part of the contemporary 2016 plot has an origin story attached to it.

+ Elijah  Woods is a very good actor, but it seems he plays a non-existent sidekick to Diesel in this movie. I guess it's work and it is work in a movie that will get a fair amount of attention. I just feel he was under-utilized for his skills.

+ The movie leaves us with potential sequels while wrapping up the current plot lines in a satisfactory way.

+ Overall it was a ""clean"" movie (a couple of S-words) that told a story and had a lot of entertainment value without all the profanity, gore or sex/nudity. Made it so I could comfortably watch this with my kids and enjoy a movie that kept our interest without shock value material. I think this one fact alone speaks volumes that stronger movies don't need to resort to that kind of stuff (e.g. most Star Wars or Lord of the Rings movies).

> Not a knock-your-socks-off movie but definitely entertaining, which is why we liked it, but didn't love it.

7486624,5,B01723F80E,"This movie is amazing! It takes the timeless magic and storytelling of the D&D universe, and puts it through a simillar spin to the new game, ""Castlevania, Lords of Shadow 2"" By which I mean, urbanization. The explanation of magic decaying and becoming both more focused, and darker. It brings magical adventures out of the golden age of heroism of yore, and into a darker age, based on the world's ACTUAL history!  (Loosely).
It then takes events into the future, to modern day, and at NO POINT, do you ever lose the thread. The plot moves in a nice flowing story, branching in little pieces of events that I really would love to have seen, but are simply good enough for back story here. (Though if they make a prequel, the rise of the Witch Queen's armies of Dream walkers  and the like would be amazing. I'm imagining a Inception/Van Helsing crossover ???)
The characters were well thought out and deliciously fantastic to see come to life. It's said that Culder is actually Vin Diesel's Real Life D&D character from their games they hosted, while on the sets of the Fast & the Furious films. If that's true, I both wonder if those games shared this darker age, type of story, and whether or not Gary Gygax has seen this, and would like to make this the next cannon age for the D&D universe!!

For all those who love fantasy films, this one both came, and went out of theaters pretty quickly. I actually managed to see it in either Imax 3D or 3D in my local one at the time. This movie is so cool, I had to own it though. As I was saying, for all TRUE fantasy fans, this film does a really excellent job of bringing the magic out of the mid-evil  era, and into the modern day. And even though I wish Michael Caine had a bigger role, his lines are inevitably, all fantastic! Vin Diesel does a wonderful job of making you believe his character has really walked through the ages. This one is sure to be added to your collections!!!",1484524800,,1933,4.406162464985995

7486667,4,B01723F80E,"Having not watched ""The Last Witch Hunter"" on the big screen, I bought the Blu Ray on a whim after seeing the trailers.

Turns out that this is another case of ""don't bother with those useless professional critics, they're a waste of space"". If you've watched Vin Diesel in XXX or Fast & Furious or Riddick, then this is the same Vin Diesel in another cool frantic action movie with fantastic, polished CGI. What's there not to like in this? There's Vin Diesel himself, there's witches, there's factions, there's humour, there's special effects.

Some people say the story is flawed but honestly, I haven't found any glaring flaw as such. It's a good old fantasy yarn and to me has good pacing i.e. there's regular action throughout the movie so there wasn't a dull moment at all. The storyline kept me interested throughout. Even the twist (I don't want to spoil it for anyone here) was quite comfortable and worked well within the movie.

If I watched my movies on the basis of these ""professional critics"", I would've missed 80% of the good movies I've seen. Only reason it's not a 5-star is because Vin Disel has made over-the-top amazing movies like Fast & Furious and XXX so I had to make room for rating THOSE 5-stars!

Stuff the critics. Watch it and judge for yourself. It's good!",1482796800,,1289,4.640350877192983

7486758,3,B01723F80E,"This is a BLU-RAY WARNING.
NOT a FILM REVIEW.

This film was fun and I enjoyed it enough to buy a copy but the copy was not authentic. I just wanted to warn you of something you should watch out for in your purchase if, like me, you want to buy this. I ordered from Amazon, the best there is when it comes to reliability for delivering an authentic product. However, an individual marketplace seller's stock got mixed in and what was shipped to me was a BD-R copy with no digital code in a very convincing package. It had the same case, the same authenticity/security sticker, the same everything except that the case's outer insert said ""BLU-RAY + DVD"" instead of ""BLU-RAY + DVD + DIGITAL HD"" and the back did not contain the Ultraviolet information across the insert about halfway down.

Examine your copy carefully on this one to double check authenticity, especially if you are buying this as a gift. The one I received was very convincing until we opened it up and saw the BD-R and then re-examined the insert and noticed the lack of UV/DIGITAL HD mention and, of course, realized that there was no code included.

Of course, if you get an authentic copy, you will know by the digital code and the presence of pressed discs but, to be clear for anyone purchasing this, the official release is a pressed Blu-ray and a pressed DVD with a Digital HD/Ultraviolet code included. Don't get fooled by a fake as they do mix marketplace ""new"" inventory in with Amazon official inventory and occasionally mistakes happen. If you buy, check it carefully so you can exchange if it is a bad copy and, if you are buying it as a gift, buy it early so you'll have time to exchange. Good luck.",1476835200,5,1681,4.4869281045751634

In other words, typical Hollywood crap in this day and age.",1476489600,,352,4.46875

One also does appreciate the relative novelty of the plot. I liked the counter points in acting skills presented by Wood and Caine, I even love Genre to which this film belongs(The reason I risked renting the film).

Now for the things that detracted from the value of the film:
Everything thing else. Its good for a 'one off' on a day when you are desperate and have nothing else to watch.",1475539200,,555,4.4411764705882355

This film has an interesting premise, but never elevates itself above just a standard action film.  Some interesting twists in the story... but not enough to make it more interesting.  Great visuals.

Kaulder is now over 800 years old still taking out demons and witches that he can find.  Kaulder also finds a young apprentice in Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) one night while trying to take out more witches and show Dolan 37th how things work.  Dolan 37th grows up over the years learning from Kaulder, but  Dolan 37th might not really be who he says he is.  I would like to say more, but don't want to ruin anything.  I really enjoyed this movie and hope they make another one.  The effects and story are pretty good for a mindless action flick that is pretty entertaining.

Michael Caine is great in anything as was his here most excellent. Rose Leslie was excellent also. She had a gamete of emotions and easily out acted Vinny. She was feisty, caring and sexy.

7486925,4,B01723F80E,"I liked the movie although I think Vin Diesel's performance wasn't that strong, and not a fan of Elijah Wood's character.  (Don't get me wrong.  I like both actors a lot.  Just a bit weak as the main character and sidekick - lacking chemistry.)  The chemistry between Vin and Michael Caine was great; I wish there was more of them together.  I liked the storyline, especially the fantasy world they created.  I would have loved to see more of the witch world / shops and such.  The bar set was really beautifully done; I liked Chloe's apartment as well as her secret garden.  ;-)

Rose Leslie was great in this movie - Chloe is my favorite character.  The chemistry between Vin and Rose was good.  Julie Engelbrecht as Witch Queen was very well done.  Well performed and great make-up / costume.  I would have loved to see more of Bronwyn, the teenage witch on the plane (played by Bex Taylor-Klaus).  I think this character could have brought some humor/edge to the storyline.  A true sidekick.  (If there was a sequel, she would have been great in it!!)

If they make a tv show, with more ""good"" witches joining on the fight, I'd watch it.  It would be nice to see their world more flushed out.

7486926,3,B01723F80E,"Interesting themes and ideas plagued by poor execution and bad writing. The directing relies on flashiness and quick cutting when longer takes and more physicality might have been better. The actors are good enough; this was a passion project of Vin Diesel's, and he fully commits. Rose Leslie is great, but isn't given much to do. Michael Caine is barely on screen. Elijah Wood should have been the emotional and thematic counterpoint, but instead has a handful of scenes that culminate in a massive plot info dump right before the crucial show-down. Overall, it feels like there was a lot left out. A fun enough action film that keeps moving - which is just as well because there is little to savor.",1468800000,,701,4.754098360655738

Liking Vin Diesel will not save you here.  Liking Ygritte will not save you.  Liking fantasy stories will not save you.  With an estimated budget of $90 million, the last I saw this had grossed about $27 million back.  Unlike ""Scouts Guide to Zombie Apocalypse"", which generates sympathy from me for its poor box, this one generates none.  I have to agree with a couple of other reviewers, who observed, My worst film of 2015 and one of the worst movies Ive ever seen.  In fact, with its reasonably good visuals but utter lack of interest on any other front, to me it most resembles ""John Carter On Mars"", a disaster so epic it cost a major CEO his job and squandered the better part of $400 million.  The best that can be said for this piece is: at least it cannot possibly exceed $100 million in losses, since it cost less than that to make.

The scenes were cool, the effects good and over all the story was a good one as far as any story about witches and immortals can be. Speaking of immortals, it is nice to see one that enjoys being impossible to kill but keeping the good path under his feet and not lamenting the fact that everyone he knows or loves has died.

7486981,5,B01723F80E,"What a super strange action movie!  I think that's the problem- it's action instead of suspense or horror.  A movie that involves bringing down a dangerous witch!  A long long time ago during the Middle Ages times Vin Diesel killed a witch in a way where her body parts turned to magical golden particles floating through caves, but not before the witch threatened to do more harm at a later time.  A sword through the chest did the trick!  Good thing match making websites didn't exist back then- I'd feel really sorry for the guy this witch tried hooking up with.

Anyway the action is so intense during this battle scene between Vin and the witch that the camera man has trouble standing still.  That's why you can barely see any of the fighting.  Then again I understand there's difficulties- it is the Middle Ages after all when cameras weren't what they are now, and of course a battle up close and personal with a witch isn't exactly as easy as filming birds flying around on branches.

Suddenly the movie changes into the current time.  Apparently Vin still lives among us.  The man doesn't age.  He's on an airplane and uses his angry looks to force a scrawny guy to stand up and move so he can talk to a short-haired brunette girl who happens to know a thing or two about witchcraft.  It's a miracle Vin happened to pick the right girl, unless he has super sensitive witch sensing abilities (and he just might!).  After all that battling a moment earlier, he probably has developed stronger senses.

The movie turns downright magical after this.  Vin has a discussion with a priest (Elijah Wood) about slaves being buried in the ground as buildings were built over them.  No burial ground hauntings though- this movie is all about Vin's action-packed witch hunting ways .  A little boy walks home from school a short time after this and happens to see a backyard light up with all kinds of super bright candy magically forming, so he does the right thing- he turns into a spoiled Willy Wonka child and tries picking the candy off the ground before Vin Diesel's appearance marks a sudden turn to reality.  Once he appears that's it- the candy disappears like it was never even there.  The boy is scared and runs home.  Makes me think Vin's the witch or just somebody who's so negative leaves fall off flowers when he walks by.

Vin and Elijah have discussions in an upstairs apartment.  Vin comes up with this test to make sure the evil witch isn't around.  He uses wind, water, earth, fire and ice elements to blow on the window and light a fire.  He thinks the room's all clear until suddenly a burning pentagram appears on the floor.  What scary special effects!  But don't take your eyes off Elijah whatever you do.  He's not who you think he is.  And don't forget about that scene where magical blue butterflies light up a room as Vin and Elijah meet up with Isaach de Bankole either.  That's quite the surprise!  Too bad a brief time later a man is running away and gets stabbed in the leg.

Anyway I can keep going but the movie just gets stranger and stranger.  Rose Lesie enters the story and the witch is all about chasing her using invisibility skills.  If you're a witch plotting revenge you have to be invisible right?  Otherwise you'd just be able to walk right up to Rose and scare her senseless!  Rose also gets a taste of the same magical land that the little boy earlier got to see- this time a garden instead of a candy land, and it's so bright Rose can only see a portion of it before having to turn away.  All this stuff occurring right in her apartment room too!

When the witch almost forms Rose has the sense to open the refrigerator door, because apparently fridge light is more witch repellent than garden light.  But she doesn't get very far thanks to the leg grabbing Middle Age creatures that hide under her floorboards.  Will someone come along, pull Rose up and rescue her from these leg grabbers?  If they can they'll have to reach far... or just hope Rose rises back up enough to easily bring her back to safety.  That's how it goes.

This movie drained me in the weirdest way I tell ya!  It's pretty awesome though.",1466899200,,4158,4.501336898395722

HOWEVER.

I was decently surprised at the amount of fun this movie had to offer. It can best be described as sitting in on a D&D table group, watching the characters on a fun little dungeon, and it was a lot of fun the entire way through. It didn't waste any time trying to explain too much to you, and had some good segways to introducing you.

Over all, I was pleasantly surprised at this fun little adventure movie. It started at a good pace, and ended well too. Not too short and not too long. Might even watch this again for the lovely details!",1466035200,,823,4.303225806451613

Sadly much like any night that begins with a lot of dim flashy lights, cool music, and a little (or a lot) drinkie, you end up somewhere and/or somehow not intended. I ended up sad wondering when/where did the story's plot go??? The movie some where in the middle gave up on itself.

The film itself is pretty good. Vin does what Vin does best - being a mostly silent bad-ass throughout most of the film.
Co-Starring Rose Leslie (Ygritte from GoT), Micheal Cain and Elijiah Wood, the film mostly takes place in modern times where witches are an off-shoot of the human race, having been born with the gift of magic and they're use is strictly enforced by the Church and Vin's character, Kaulder.

There's a couple of really great scenes between Vin and Cain, which really show you that Vin is not just a muscle-bound action hero.",1464220800,,659,4.6239316239316235

Either way the performances are not bad nor are they earth-shattering. The special FX is clean and there is no shaky cam theatrics. If you are however looking for something like Inception, Edge of Tomorrow or Star Wars, films that move up to 2 hours+ then watch those and not this. The plot does not have that anti-climax right around an hour and 30 minutes in where ""Oh no we have to do the thing with the thing now instead because plan A failed""  This is strictly a Plan A 1 hour and 45 minute movie.

The modern world holds many secrets, but the most astounding secret of all is that witches still live amongst us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world. Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including Kaulder (Vin Diesel) a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful Queen Witch, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen curses Kaulder with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today Kaulder is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Queen Witch is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race.

This is a cool action fantasy movie, one of the best in a while, its a good fun story that's well paced out with plenty of magic and witchery, the cast is all good, Diesel plays his usual macho character but its good to see him in something a bit different to driving cars, Rose Leslie is very nice as the female lead sidekick, lots of other famous faces pop up too like Michael Caine and Elijah Wood, The effects look very cool, especially I thought the witch queen was a great character and looked evil with the unique way she was portrayed and great make-up effects, played fantastically by Julie Engelbrecht too, if you love a good action fantasy or your just a big Diesel fan this is a must see, very entertaining from start to end, worthy of a sequel for sure.

It's a Vin Diesel movie with him being a bad-ass to help good overcome evil. I loved him in this role. Although he has his typical ""don't mess with me, you don't know who your dealing with"" attitude, you actually got to see a real person. Talking normal, joking around with friends, caring for someone, etc. The plot is the standard ""good versus evil"" theme. There was a twist, though, that took me completely by surprise.

7487423,2,B01723F80E,"Possible spoilers.  Vin Diesel (Pitch Black) stars in this inglorious fable of witch killing dating back to feudal days of the Middle Ages.  In a promising prologue, we find Kaulder leading a group of men searching for the witch queen who has wreaked havoc on their local community.  The details of such havoc are uncertain, but I think Kaulders family was killed.  Slipping into the witchs lair located in a giant tree, the witch and her evil magic manages to wipe out Kaulders buddies leaving only him and his flaming sword to go mano y mano against the ugly queen.  As he succeeds, albeit with his own demise imminent, she has one last surprise.  You see, he has nothing to live for, but she touches his heart (literally) giving him everlasting life.

Next we find him in modern times, continuing his quest for witches, although just keeping them at bay is protocol these days.  His handler is the 36th Dolan (Michael Caine, The Dark Knight) who is part of a quasi-religious order called The Axe and Cross.  Hes number 36 in the line of succession, all named Dolan.  36 wants to retire so 37 (Elijah Wood, Lord of the Rings) is brought in to help Kaulder with his chores.

Director Breck Eisner (The Crazies) handles these early scenes fine, but then the confusing screenplay takes over and things go awry.  Three writers are credited so perhaps that is the problem.  New characters come in with no back story.  So who are they and what is their purpose?  And where have they been all this time?  Aside from sorting out who is good and who is evil we don't learn much.  Rose Leslie (Ygritte from Game of Thrones) is a nice addition playing Chloe, a witchy bar owner with special abilities to dreamwalk or get into the dreams of others.  She helps Kaulder when he must go into a dream state to learn something of importance which may or may not save the life of 36 who may or may not be dead.

The film has a couple twists that those still awake will see coming, but frankly I didn't care much.  I suspect the filmmakers thought of this film as another franchise for Diesel and certainly the ending left that possibility.  It was budgeted at about $75 million much of which shows in the very good SFX.  With the box office returns I would be surprised if there was.  At the same time I wouldnt bet against Vin Diesel.",1459641600,,2319,4.4821002386634845

While this movie certainly spans history, has magic, and there is witch killing, it all seems to just fall short of GREAT!  That said, this is still a fun movie to watch, and is entertaining.  It somewhat scratches the Lovecraftian Horrors being hunted in the shadows, supported by the Church, with an action hero and cool mystical special effects.  Entertaining yes.

7487514,2,B01723F80E,"Not as good as I thought it would be. I can't enjoy Vin Diesel outside the Riddick universe, seeing him smiling and being sentimental is just too unnatural for me.  And this movie needed more of a hard-edged, cold , stonehearted hero.  The plot was pretty thin  and very little made logical sense.  They leaned on horror movie tropes, flies signaling that evil is near, for example, and the special effects were nothing special.  There was no build up to suspense and the witch wasn't all that scary or particularly threatening.  Plus, there was absolutely zero chemistry between Vin and  Leslie Rose.  All that said, it was a serviceable movie if you don't think too much and want a diversion for two hours.  I fault the writer(s) for its failure in my eyes.  And I'm looking forward to the next Riddick film and something really thrilling like the next Fury Road.",1459123200,,865,4.66887417218543

7487661,5,B01723F80E,"I enjoyed this film. Vin seems to choose iconic roles which suit his laconic delivery. So its a case of do what you do best, and Vin Delivers. I thought Olaffsun[sp?] was Lordi's lead singer under his original name but no, however Olaffsun could double as Lordi's Brother/Doppledanger quite easily. Using Wood and Caine is quite smart. These two roles are instrumental, since you have to like them for the roles to work. The film creates its own unique mythology, which is what some negative reviewers do not seem to get. Another case of, 'What film did they see"", since this film works in its ""genre""( a word I hate, since its a story and it works seemingly across genres in my view). The ""rules"" are set down in this film, so I could see how doing a second and third film works. This film is its own world, and has its own set of rules. I could also see why some wiccan practitioners might not like this film, but... its fiction, and as Joan Rivers says, get over it. Vin is likeable as the lead role, however he functions well in ensemble casts and this is one where the ensemble is very good. Writing is great , in my view, dovetails well with the FX. Very few actors could carry off this role with Vin's on screen presence being in my view , superb. Its not a documentary, so some of the criticisms really do not make a bit of sense. If you want a great rollicking adventure with a touch of the supernatural, you will love this film.",1457740800,,1438,4.32962962962963

The plot idea was unique and different.  2 stars because it was very choppy, could not keep track of what was going on because of that choppiness.  The opening, you meet the character, and then it tries to explain who he is thru flashbacks.
Overall if you like action, watch this movie, if you're looking for a mind engaging movie don't watch it.",1457308800,,387,4.361111111111111

No, of course not, but it IS entertaining and the production value is high.

Following the Blade (1998)/Underworld (2003) playbook, Highlander (1986) meets Constantine (2005) as our hero Kaulder (Vin Diesel; Furious 7, Guardians of the Galaxy, Riddick) suffers the Van Helsing curse to hunt criminal witches across the centuries.  Vin Diesel's immortal has gained no more wisdom or savoir-faire in his centuries of experience than Dominic Torreto has in his seemingly unending supply of heist movies.  They're basically the same coarse unkillable character, only one of them is a several hundred-year-old, flaming sword swinging hunter of the Dark Arts afflicted with a curse (eye roll!) of eternal life whereas Dom graduated from living life a quarter-mile at a time to $100 million dollar jobs across the globe.

They say Vin made this movie to erect a world around his love for Dungeons and Dragons and I'd say, as a major D&D enthusiast, he succeeded.  The world-building may not be as refined as the program-infested The Matrix (1999), the enchanted academia of Harry Potter (2001), Avatar's (2009) xenoscape or John Wick's (2014) underground assassin society, but he laid down an ambitiously solid franchise foundation.  Now I could write thousands of words making fun of this movie--poking holes in the story and pointing out things I think are silly or bit dumbor very dumb.  But at the end of the day, I really enjoyed it!  Hell, I think I want more of these.  Let the academics be critical and scoff, but I love Vin's franchises (Fast and Furious, Guardians of the Galaxy, Riddick and maaaaybe even xXx, which is getting another sequel).

This flick features an awesome diversity of witches, spells and magical itemsdown to flaming swords, the witch queen's (Julie Engelbrecht) lair in a giant Game of Thrones tree, and even a Gummi Bear illusion reminding me of Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters (2013).  But what keeps us from slipping off into the deep end is Michael Caine (The Dark Knight Rises).  He plays his 36th Dolan, a watcher, confession receiver, advisor and record keeper to Kaulder.  He is the humanity and soul of the film whereas Vin is more of the film's flexed, sweat-glistening bicep.  He is replaced by an eager-to-please Elijah Wood (Cooties), who is the Shia LeBouf to Keanu's Constantine.

Caine dies but his apparently natural death was concealed by the darkest magic imaginable--""darker than evil.""  Cue more eye-rolling.  Phrases like ""darker than evil"" and constantly hearing Vin Diesel use the word ""magic"" verge on comical.  Vin travels the world using pick-up lines honed over centuries on dim-witted flight attendants between Dungeons and Dragons missions to recover ancient artifacts.  He even keeps a treasure horde in a secret vault like a high-level character in his chic NYC penthouse, afforded from centuries of saving up (I guess).  It's all very silly, even stupid, but there's just something about this urban fantasy that appeals to me.

In this world witches live among us in secret and, according to ""the truce,"" they cannot use magic on humans.  Kaulder is the peace keeper, the Judge Dredd.  And like John Constantine (2005), he keeps the balance and employs arcane boy scout tricks to detect magic.  Oh, and his new girlfriend Chloe's (Rose Leslie; Game of Thrones) bar is akin to Midnight's hangout.

He also explains things a lot, simple things and obscure notions alike.  I would have preferred more subtlety, but every time I roll my eyes it's accompanied by a smile.  Is all this blunt exposition perhaps deliberate?  Well, let's just say he actually makes reference to ""a 14th level Warlock.""  A classic D&D bazinga!

Have I compared this to Constantine enough yet?  Probably not.  Well Balthazar (aka Belial, a devil in the Monster Manual) is the bad guy, as was Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) the baddie in Constantine.  No reason to be annoyed, though.  Fun diversions come in all form of plague trees, magic potions, high councils, plague flies (crawling under the skin--yes, like Constantine), a monstrous sentinel (like a Bone Golem)everything a Dungeons and Dragons dork could want.  Except for maybe a dragon--they'll save that for the sequel.  And boy did they set us up for a guaranteed sequel.

This film does not deliver an original story--not even close.  But the magical and monstrous visuals are a popcorn spectacle to be celebrated and our new gruff hero is familiar in all the ways we seem to enjoy seeing over and over again.  Even if we're not going to dole out Oscars at it, this flick is worth seeing, renting, even owning if you're a Vin Diesel fan.  And if you're not, then you should've known better than to watch this.

If you decide not to be critical, then this will happily bring out the nostalgic geek in you.",1456963200,,5228,5.057242990654205

7487889,4,B01723F80E,"Like Fantasy movies, like magic. flaming swords and D&D? Or if you like ""You know nothing Jon Snow"" Probably enjoy this movie.

The Last Witch Hunter is what it is if you accept that and don't go in expecting something else it will be an entertaining movie. Anyone expecting something deep or emotionally moving or comedy, you are in the wrong place.
It is nice to see Rose Leslie getting some work after GoT (spoiler) I personally was pretty disappointed she is longer on the show I really liked her character. That said it has nothing to do with Last Witch Hunter but some people might check it out just for her.

If you like fantasy movies this is your jam just don't expect it to be something it is not. If it's not what you are in the mood for then rent/buy something else.

Just a note for those that liked the movie. It is pretty well known Vin Diesel played/plays some D&D and this character has some ties to his character back in the day.
In fact Vin Diesel plays some D&D to promote the movie, as a Witch Hunter, with Matt Mercer (voice actor) and a member of Geek and Sundry, along with Nerdist. It's worth checking out.",1456876800,,1131,4.350710900473934

7487892,2,B01723F80E,"I like movies like this if done well. This one not so much. It tries to compress too many elements into it while giving little room for actual character development. The action seems built up just to fall flat. It wants to create its own world, but in the end feels like a simi disjointed series of action scences with some dialogue thrown in between to create some semblance of an interesting plot. The story is rather predictable despite trying to throw the viewer curveballs. The acting wasn't necessarily bad or horrible; however, there was little chemistry between the characters again they aren't developed well. If you're looking for unimaginative fight scenes mix with special effects and aren't so worried about the rest I guess it will do. I think a movie like John Wick, which has a simple direct plot line and superior action sequences, does a much better job of creating a memorable and rewatchable film while creating a brilliant noir in a shorter time span. I have no problems with long(er) movies. I just would like to be compelled to keep watching. For The Last Witch Hunter I was compelled to find something interesting. By the end of the movie I was disappointed to never find it. The idea behind the movie is lovely. The delivery just isn't there.",1456876800,2,1267,4.711711711711712

I LOVED this movie. From the start of the movie to the ending, this movie is a fantastic, solid Urban Fantasy. Vin Diesel did a great job in this role, and I hope to see him in more roles like it. While still action, this let him also play something outside of his normal franchises and that was wonderful to see.

The only thing keeping this from being a five star review is that I felt there were places in the movie that needed a little more information dropped in, and other places that had too much. I don't want an info-dump but it helps to be able to relate a bit to side-characters who actually matter.

7488085,4,B01723F80E,"I just watched this movie last night.

I watched it because I wanted to see big bad Vin Diesel have a cheesy role and it did not disappoint.
Gave me a similar feeling to the ""Underworld"" franchises. Except more colorful and more CGI.

Instead of vampires vs lycans you get Frodo Baggins and Riddick fighting witches.

It has a gummy bear tree.

While I wouldn't buy the movie, it's definitely worth watching.

Plus it has the chick that plays Ygritte from Game of Thrones.",1456444800,,472,4.571428571428571

The niche that this movie is trying to fit into (dark fantasy) is a tough one and the movie does an exceptional job of blending action with imagination. If you watch the short animated films that go with this movie and learn more of the backstory, you will see that they did a great job of building a fictional history for the antagonists/protagonists and the characters were given meaning and histories. This isn't an extravagant Peter Jackson LOtR or Hobbit trilogy-type epic and it isn't pretending to be. Nor is this a hack & slash romp like Van Helsing but instead is a well crafted, well acted and very entertaining movie if you have what so many critics seem to be lacking these days...an imagination. The costumes and sets were perfect for the film and the interaction between the main characters (other than a somewhat weak performance by Elijah Wood) were very entertaining to watch. And yes, I grew up in the 70's and early 80's playing D&D so I can see where Vin Diesel is coming from with his character.

In this film the Witch Bar/Club really enthralled me. It created a nostalgic feeling I attribute to Harry Potter. If you had asked me what I thought witches and sorcerers looked like in HP I would have pointed you to this film. It shows a very different portrayal of evil witches vs good ones. Voldemort's make up and the direction they went with him in the film didn't speak to me as I felt it should have.

I am giving it 4 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for.  It's a supernatural action movie with really good special effects.  The magic was cool (the prison-monster, Witch Club and Gummy Bear Tree) and the actors did an excellent job.

While the movie was exactly what I expected, it misses the 5 star treatment for not being original and engrossing enough.  The story didn't really draw me in.

In summary, a good movie, but not one I would watch again!",1455753600,,572,4.495145631067961

I didn't feel like there were any inconsistencies or flaws in storyline, as there sometimes are with action movies. I felt it went together seemlessly, with an intruiging fantasy / supernatural theme. Even the good-ole 'Catholics versus demonism' idea is still able to hold relevance in modern films. Vin Diesel is the perfect combination of cocky, confident, humorous, and serious-action when needed.

I'm hoping there will be a sequel (and I'm hoping Vin Diesel continues to do more Riddick films too).",1455667200,,627,5.028846153846154

7488222,4,B01723F80E,"Vin Diesel who plays Kaulder has always been able to choose good roles. And it's always fun when he shows his lighter side. In this movie, he has been cursed and being cursed,  immortalized by an evil witch in ancient times, to live forever. Losing his family, his mission in life has become a Witch hunter, working for The Axe and Cross, keeping a sort of truce between good and bad witches and humans. Throughout his journey, he is assigned a keeper. Of course being immortal, he goes through many Dolan, or keepers. His retiring keeper, Michael Caine the 36th Dolan, has died in sleep the very night of his retirement, or has he ?, He has been replaced by none other than that loveable little Hobbit,  Elijah Wood. Who has pledged undying loyalty to Kaulder. Or at least we think he has... And so the story begins... When Kaulder and the 37th Dolan (Wood) enter the home of the 36th's Dolans home they find black magic, this then leads them back to find that Caine, the 36th isn't really dead, yet. But under a heavy black spell. Can Kaulder free him from the spell in time to save him.. Well, you'll have to watch the movie and find out..
Although this movie wasn't that well rec'd critically, it is an enjoyable movie. It's not a horror movie filled with gore. But it is a fun movie and worth watching. The Last Witch Hunter.. It's certainly worth the rental price. I hope you enjoy the movie..",1455667200,,1399,4.4609375

Michael Caine phones in his part for the check.  Vin Diesel tries hard but he has nothing to play, and zero chemistry with the female lead, whoever she is.

Vin Diesel as Riddick is a real favorite of mine so I had high hopes and while this film captures some of Riddick's bravado, this is a more complex character and, while lots of fun, it's not Riddick. I think snobs who say Diesel can't act are as shallow as some of his characters are supposed to be, but when Diesel and Michael Caine have extended dialog, you can tell which one is the old master. The rest of the movie pairs Diesel with younger characters (nice to see Elijah Wood and Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey) that respond well to his strengths and the movie carries right along. Special effects are great. Witchcraft, especially the modern stuff in the witches lounge is sure to capture some young imaginations who fantasize about potions and spells. It's quite visually beautiful and dark and ghastly, as called for by the script. All those elements add up to four stars for me. That fifth star for me represents being truly transported to a new level of philosophy or a depth of plot turns that this film did not contemplate, so its a solid four.

7488471,1,B01723F80E,"Hopefully, ""The Last Witch Hunter"" is the last movie Vin will make that is this bad. I love the Riddick series and can even handle most of the car chase films, but Witch Hunter is just plain awful on many levels. The special events are ordinary, the action sequences are too few and far between, and there is way too much blah, blah, blah. Michael Caine adds some class to the proceedings, but his on-screen time is limited and I don't blame him for seeming disinterested in the proceedings. From an acting perspective, I can live with Vin playing the same character in every movie he's ever made when the action is, well, fast and furious (sorry), but there just wasn't enough of it in Witch Hunter. Don't waste your money on buying this movie. It will be out on Netflix or on DVD soon enough, if not already there. I will look forward to the next installment in the Riddick series, but Witch Hunter just didn't do it for me.",1455494400,,926,4.421052631578948

Elijah Wood, while pivotal to the story line, feels a bit superfluous and not fully drawn out, but Rose Leslie is a great supporting character. It's nothing that hasn't been done before and you'll be reminded of other similar plot lines and plot devices throughout (e..g.

I wish they would have ramped up the love interest between Rose Leslie (I love her little barely concealed Scots ways) and Vin Diesel's characters. The story was awesome. Michael Caine was awesome but somehow I had to watch this movie in two pieces. Either there was too much going on or, not enough. I was getting whip lash. It's like it needed another 30 minutes or so of explaining some of the things that they could have really gone deep on. The set was magnificent, the CG...everything. Vin Diesal could just stand there and grin and I'd watch for 1.5 hrs.. But since he's an actor, and he produced this movie as well, he may as well throw himself into it. Maybe he was tired. Maybe he's still grieving over the death of friend Paul Walker. It just seemed like during this movie, where it needed something, there was not quite enough.

7488505,3,B01723F80E,"Most people have that one actor or actress that they will watch anything they are in. For me, thats Vin Diesel. The first movie I saw him in was Pitch Black, and I have been enjoying his films ever since. I don't put too much stock into reviews by professional critics, since I often feel the opposite of what they do. So when I kept hearing not so positive reviews for The Last Witch Hunter, I still had hope for the movie. Alas, I should have listened this time.

Spoilers Ahead.

The storyline was decent, Vin Diesels acting was good, as was Elijah Wood and Michael Caines. To me, the best acting in this film went to Rose Leslie, and at this point if they make a part two, shell be the reason I watch it.

My biggest complaint was the CGI effects with all the flies, it was just used for so much of the movie. I know a month from now, if someone mentions this film, thats all I will remember. Sure they were integral to the story line, thats how you knew something bad was going to go down, but it wasn't even creepy or gross.

Major Spoiler..

My other problem was Elijah Wood, not his acting, but towards the end we find out that the Council that is supposed to be protecting human-kind has kept the heart of the evil witch. At that point, it was obvious that Wood was one of the bad guys. And from the conversation he and Diesel had, I thought it was supposed to be obvious to the witch hunter as well.
Then we have them working together shortly after, only to have Wood bow to the queen witch. At this point Diesels character starts beating on him for working with the queen. All I could think was, Duh!, we already knew he was. so either it was bad writing, or I just thought something was in the previous dialogue/scene that was not really there.
I would say skip this one, and just rewatch Pitch Black instead.",1455235200,,1821,4.2514450867052025

Fails in just about every way a movie could -- idiot script, terrible FX, horribly inept directing and editing, cheap action scenes so poorly shot you can't see what's going on, etc etc etc. Doesn't help that Diesel, Wood and Michael Caine (!!!) are in it.

7488534,3,B01723F80E,"I am not a die hard fan of Vin Diesel. But I must admit his manhood captivates me. That's the primary reason I picked this rental up, and got very disappointed. Diesel is still charming and convincing as he always is. Pity that the movie sucks. ^^^Spoiler alert***. There had been too many holes in the story. If the Witch Queen could transfer her immortality (and power to recover fast like Wolverine) to Kaulder (the witch hunter acted by Diesel), she should not have been killed by him twice when she was immortal and he was mortal. Also there's no telling why Kaulder had been that special or powerful to kill her. Regarding the cinematography, the best scenes had all been shown in the trailer. There should have been much more elaboration on the burning tree, the sentinel that jailed witches, the power/magic of witches appeared etc etc..but there was minimal, if not none. The CG was weak, and there was much more talking than fighting, whereas the fight scenes were short and mediocre........Don't know why this movie reminded me of Kennu Reeves' Constantine, which I like much more.......In short, ok for a rental, but definitely not qualified for a purchase.",1454976000,,1169,4.82089552238806

That being said sounds like the typical Hollywood movie. What makes it different is the protagonist's internal struggle to see himself as a weapon or a person who cares.

This seems to be the direction Hollywood is heading, instead of  trying to make a single awesome movie they are writing scripts that based on a movies success can spawn sequels.  I find nothing wrong with this especially when the movie has great special effects & acting which this movie certainly has both.  ""The Last Witch Hunter"" may be the first in line of a awesome movie franchise!  I don't like giving details that may spoil a movie ( which I may have already done) but  this is basically a good against evil movie with some twist and turns that keep it from being overly predictable.  Lets just say the characters are far from black & white and a bit more complex then you might expect.

7488643,3,B01723F80E,"The Good:

As expected, Vin Diesel brings the strong, cool demeanor that we've come to know over the years. The film gets you started early with some magical action. This movie is chock full of special effects with all of the magic that is used from beginning to end. One thing that will keep you engaged is probably how the story is presented. We get to follow an interesting mystery that unravels at a reasonable pace. Best of all, there's a nice plot twist that was completely unexpected. Also, while this movie wasn't necessarily a horror film, there were some scenes that had the Queen Witch looking kind of scary.

The Bad:

There were a couple of moments where the the CG effects were just a tad bit over kill. Things would happen so fast, with so many lights flashing, that it was hard to make out what exactly was going on. Probably one of the most disappointing aspects of this film was the anticlimactic ending. For the entire duration of the movie, we're led to believe that the main enemy is so powerful and a threat to be feared. However, the final battle just felt rushed and was a little unsatisfactory. Matter of fact, the entire ending seemed under-developed. It seemed like the writers wanted to just finish the movie, which ended the film in a very convenient way.

The Reason:

The best way I  could describe this movie would be to say that it's Blade + Constantine (except with witches.) There haven't been very many witchcraft or magic oriented movies for a while, since we've been stuck on vampires, zombies and paranormal activity ghosts. What you see in the trailer is exactly what you're going to get. Despite the so-so ending, it was still an enjoyable movie overall for the most part. I'd recommend seeing it in theaters for the matinee price and with low expectations.

The Rating: 7/10

7488671,4,B01723F80E,"I am not a Vin Diesel fan, but I thought I would give this one a try because of the other supporting actors in the movie. It wasn't too bad. Vin Diesel actually did a decent job. I also love anything sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, scary, etc. This wasn't a scary edge of your seat type of movie, but it was a decent watch. The graphics were really good and the story line was good.

The movie starts with Vin Diesels character 800 years ago on a witch hunt to kill the queen witch. As he was killing her though she curses him with immortality. We then speed forward to modern day where witches and human co-exist in peace as long as witches obey the rule to do no harm to humans. Diesel the immortal witch hunters job is to keep this order by hunting down any witches that don't abide by the rules. Little does he know some evil is brewing in an attempt to resurrect the queen.

It's a decent watch if you like those kind of movies or are a Vin Diesel fan. I'm not like I said, but still surprisingly enjoyed it. I'd recommend.",1454630400,,1023,4.187817258883249

7488674,3,B01723F80E,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

As a form of entertainment special effects movies seem to have taken over, sometimes to the delight of movie lovers and while at other times to their dismay. It seems that the more Hollywood relies on the computer generated image (CGI) the less outstanding it becomes; its accepted and expected rather than something spectacular to view. What makes a movie outstanding in cases like this is the story. Does it involve the viewer, does it engage the viewer and does it make sense? On rare occasions it happens (consider the STAR WARS movies). In some it doesnt (consider most SyFy Channel movies). But for the most part it falls somewhere in between. Such is the case with THE LAST WITCH HUNTER.

The film opens in the past when the last great battles were taking place between humans and witches. The Witch Queen has retreated to her den and a group of sword wielding humans have tracked her down with the intent of finishing her and her kind. A battle ensues and Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is left facing the witch, sword in hand, a combination of iron and fire required to kill her with a blow to her heart. He strikes but she does the same to him, making him immortal while she withers away to dust.

Fast forward to the future where witches still exists. Apparently killing the Witch Queen did not do them all in. Now Kaulder works for a secretive organization with ties to the Catholic Church that tracks down witches and uses of witchcraft to prevent them from killing humans. It ranges from small things like misguided teens attempting witchcraft to full blown killers on the street.

Helping the witch hunter is the Dolan, currently at their 37th incarnation played by Michael Caine. The Dolan has helped Kaulder through the decades, informing him of outbreaks and incidents as well as providing him with the tools needed to accomplish his tasks. Dolan the 37th is about to retire now and Kaulder presents him with a gift. His replacement, Dolan the 38th (Elijah Wood) arrives and is introduced. As he and Kaulder become acquainted, his predecessor is killed before Kaulder can return to save him.

Investigating his friends death, Kaulder finds a clue from him to look into his first death. To remember he visits a spell worker, sort of an allocated witch, named Chloe (Rose Leslie). While under a memory spell hes cuffed and left to die in an inferno as the real witch behind the events that have happened escapes. Of course so does Kaulder. Tracking down this witch and finding out who is really responsible becomes the goal of Kaulder with the help of his new Dolan and Chloe. But can he find the answers before time runs out for him as well as humanity?

The story here is actually a good one when you look at it. A bad guy is presented early on along with a hero to prevent that evil from succeeding. The conspiracy of a secretive organization there to protect the world falls in line with many movies today as does a secondary group there to counter them. But while its a good story it seems more commonplace than I thought it would be. Perhaps thats because Im a jaded movie goer who sees more than most. For me while I thought the story was good it felt too familiar in some ways.

Diesel does a great job as Kaulder. Physically Diesel has always been the musclebound hero in more than one film. But here he allows his character to smile on occasion and to talk and think deeper than most are used to. The ability to play characters like this has always been there and in truth most have had that combination of brains and brawn. But its his physical appearance that most fans notice, much like they did with Sylvester Stallone, another underrated actor remembered more for his physicality than his abilities. Hopefully that will change.

In the end the film was entertaining but so fueled by CGI events that it fell into that mid-range category of effects driven films. Sure it was fun but with so many movies coming out like this the odds are that it gets lost in the mix. Not much about it makes it stand out above the rest. A good time can be had watching the movie but repeated viewings aren't likely for most with the exception of Vin Diesel fans. Its a fun movie but not outstanding. And in a world populated by CGI creations something more needs added to the mix to make it memorable.",1454630400,2,4359,4.558109833971903

7488702,4,B01723F80E,"The Last Witch Hunter(released Oct/15) stars,among others,Vin Diesel,Elijah Wood,Rose Leslie and Michael Caine. I thought this film was quite engaging from the get go and it managed to maintain that interest(generally)throughout the film.
The story opens 800 years in the past as Vin Diesel(Kaulder) and fellow members of the Axe and Cross are descending into the ground beneath a giant deformed tree. This is a witch hunting party and they are after killing the witch queen herself. She doesn't go down without a fight,but in the process as VD is giving her the coup de gras,in her ""death"",she grants him a curse:immortality.
Fast Forward to present day and VD is living in NYC with Caine(36th Dolan) as his loyal assistant. It is on the eve of Caine's retirement and his replacement(Wood) taking over,who has been hand picked by a special council of witches(Axe and Cross) that has maintained law and order between witches and humans for centuries. Any witches breaking the truce are tried and interned there forever. The next day as the new assistant starts Caine is suddenly reported dead. The two attend Caine's apartment to discover traces of an ancient black magic there,and a clue that his friend left;that he must remember his death. They next go to a bar run by Leslie(Chloe) where they can obtain a memory potion. They confront one(Belial) that is trying to bring back the queen to life. In the process the bar is burned down and Belial escapes. VD returns to his old friend and confirms he is not dead but has been put under a spell. He has only a short time left to break it before he really dies. Chloe realizes she has a friend who has some ingredients for a memory potion and off they go. But Belial has been there ahead of them,taken the ingredients and killed her friend. The only other place VD knows is a woman who is witch and runs a fashion house as a front. They go there but the witch puts VD into a trance. Chloe enters his mind and pulls VD out of his trance just as they are carting him away,and saves him. It is afterward VD realizes he has his passport into his memory through Chloe;a dream walker. Into his mind they go and VD finds that the queen witch's heart was actually kept by one of his friends of the Axe and Cross,not destroyed as he always believed. Incensed VD confronts Wood who says that Caine told him not to say anything and that he was probably about to finally dispose of the heart the night he was put under a spell. If the heart dies,so does VD.
VD follows the trail and finds the spot where Belial,who now has the heart,has planted it in the ground. Belial has tied another blind witch to the tree who will become a sacrifice for the returning queen. VD kills Belial but the queen re-emerges through the blind witch and takes back her immortality from VD.She had obviously been using him as a vessel until the next time they met again.
VD returns to Caine who is now up and about and who urges him to keep fighting the good fight,even though he feels the Axe and Cross council has betrayed him. VD,Wood and Chloe go to the underground holding facility of the Axe and Cross prison for witches. It is here the witch queen will use the minds of all the witches imprisoned to release a plague on mankind. VD realizes if just one witch mind is corrupted,the spell will not work. He pulls one out of stasis and Chloe enters his mind and kills him. While she is thus engaged VD is busy trying to destroy the animated`beast`` that actually does the imprisoning. After he brings it down he then confronts the queen. Just as he has her where he wants her Wood takes Chloe at gunpoint,telling him he really has been working for the queen all along. This distracts VD long enough for the queen to temporarily take him down. As she uses Chloe's mind walking gifts to once again complete the witches circle and unleash the plague,in VD`s mind his original wife and child tell him to get back up,that he has work to do. This he does and throws his sword into the chest of the queen. As she lay there on the ground and he is about to put the sword through her heart, Chloe stops him. She convinces him that he still has much more to do, and without him the world would have a bleak future.
VD and Chloe return to his apartment,where he disposes of the heart in his vault and Caine & Chloe pledge their help to fight witches by VD`s side.
I found the movie vastly entertaining. It was edited nicely and the film moved along very well. Vin Diesel conveyed a lot by not emoting to the hills. Kind of a Clint Eastwood-ish approach. It played well off of the others, who had to play it straight down the line. The S/FX were well done and the jumps back and forth between present and past were far less annoying than normal. As the film ends it is apparent there are going to be sequels,depending on how well the producers think they did this time around.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound here with commentary,deleted scenes,a music vid,a small featurette, and five short animated films narrated by Caine as to the origins of the Axe and Cross and Vin Diesels role in it. These were put out in advance of the film to promote it.
All in all a nicely done piece of film. All actors are spot on and VD carries the star load well on his shoulders. With a Clint Eastwood type of less-is-more acting style,he manages to convey a loneliness and the great burden of 800 years of existence into his acting dynamic. Recommended. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1454457600,,5533,4.468379446640316

My friends/family all know me to have watched more movies than a person should in a lifetime...  And, this film really did well for my expectations!  Diesel's enthusiasm, the deliciously 'un-Frodo' Elijah Woods (ok, he still looks like Frodo.  Man can't help it.  It's his eyes.), the spunky Rose Leslie from GoT, great digital effects, and the playful tease of 21st Century humor made an otherwise lack-luster story a playful and fantastic romp for 2 hours.

7488725,3,B01723F80E,"There are no big surprises with LWH as it is a typical fantasy action movie.  I won't say this movie is great but I don't think it was bad either as this was actually better than I expected it to be.  It starts off interestingly enough with the opening sequence starting out in an old world setting before it veers off into a modern day New York.  If anything about the movie that disappointed me was that it went straight into a familiar storyline about hunting creatures of the old world in the modern one, such as Underworld, Blade and others.  I am a fan of those types of movies but I like those a bit better than this one.  I would have really liked this movie more if it had stayed in the past setting up a sequel for a more modern time giving a more original feel to the story.  Even with the lack of originality in the story which was a bit predictable and has a few plot holes, I still enjoyed watching the movie as it was entertaining.  The special effects were well done and the action sequences kept me interested.  I would have liked to see more of Michael Caine though as his role is pretty limited in the movie.  On the other hand, Elijah Woods seemed a bit out of place to me in this movie.

For those that are fans of Vin Diesel or like fantasy action style movies (ala Underworld and others), then there is enough here to keep you entertained, even if it is following a familiar path.

Another view of  the lore of witches and how they want people to believe they only worship nature and not an evil bone in their bodies can be found.  UNTIL  - you profess they aren't a particular favorite of yours, the image of lovely people become a nightmare no one ever wants to have.  The usual war of the spiritual against the hellions where evil defeats the spiritual soul of professed priests because they don't truly believe what they preach.  The relationship of Diesel's character and his priest protector is deep respect and trust.  When the priest is attacked Diesel goes after the mean as a viper Queen Witch who cursed him in ancient times to never die.  I just like watching him go to work and this one especially because he joins a modern day witch who reluctantly ends up caring for him and joining him against the evil that hurts the ""good witches"".

I have to admit that I was not expecting a whole lot from this movie. This usually isn't my kind of movie and I am not a huge Vin Diesel fan.

believe it or not i watched a 40 minute long adventure where vin and a group of other actors investigated a town in a marsh with a magical enchantment placed upon it.

i never heard that this was going to happen, but im fairly surprised at how well it turned out!

a good cast of characters from my movie watching history, i always wondered what happened to that hobbit that i knew when i was a kid!

to top it off some fairly hawt witches in the movie too, especially vin's ginger sidekick (i got a weakness for them ;))

im certainly interested in seeing if he intends on making a series out of this, the end certainly hinted at it (no post credits scene for all you nuts out there). im most interested in kaulder himself and how he is able to use some of his abilities considering he wasent mentioned to have witch/warlock blood in him.",1454025600,,980,4.333333333333333

7488887,3,B01723F80E,"We liked this movie. We have no young children, and we all like suspense and some action/adventure, and this movie fit the bill. The movie starts off with Diesel's character being cursed with immortality by the witch queen he fights and kills, or so he thinks. Flash forward, and we find Diesel's Kaulder character still immortal, but having reached a peace accord with the witch world.  Now, he actually fights to protect the accord and consequently the witches. But Kaulder doesn't realize that the queen isn't actually dead, and now he must fight her yet again before the witch queen can unleash a plaque which will wipe humans from the world and allow the witches to reign supreme. This time, he is helped by a witch who proves to be a valuable ally, and is also helped by a line of priests sworn to provide assistance to him throughout his life.

Sounds pretty good, right? I think this movie may have been marred by Diesel's loss of Paul Walker when filming began. Filming was actually delayed because of Walker's death, or so the story goes. I think the characters were neat, casting was fairly spot on, and it really could lead to sequels, due to plot twists and such.

Overall, we liked this movie. It isn't any Lord of the Rings (I'm referencing of course Frodo's/Elijah Wood's appearance in this movie), but overall, it is a good and watchable movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger children, or for those who don't like jump scares. Frankly, if I can watch this movie, then most people can. I tend to get very scared of most ""horror"" movies. [I'm a wimp]

Yes, our family would recommend this movie.",1453507200,24,1623,4.644599303135888

Another reviewer called it 'lazy but not terrible' ... we call it mediocre - of only ordinary or moderate quality because it is in fact a lazy film that squandered the awesome opportunity to better utilize a powerful presence like Michael Cane.

I don't pretend to understand what other people are into when it comes to entertainment or stimulation. I don't have a foot fetish, if you do, you're likely to visit shoe stores for very different, genital based reasons than I. With that said, and sticking with the porn comparison motif, if you're into girl on girl, this is ""mature housewives do young housemaids"". It's close enough to your liking that if you're in serious need of stimulation, you're willing to give it a shot, but it's awkward, because the pieces don't fit all your standards and you just can't get into it.

Vin Diesel... The dude has always looked like a slightly retarded big toe to me, he isn't a great actor, he's a ""fun actor"", most of the time. His borderline down syndrome face has always irritated me when he twists it up screaming and his oddly disproportionate body struggles to be intimidating when really he just looks like a big midget, don't get pedantic on me, you know what I'm saying.

The Last Witch Hunter is a movie that could have been really fun, but it devolves into something so silly it's hard to pay attention to by half way through it. Diesel plays an immortal witch Hunter in a plot so translucent if you haven't figured the entire thing and know how it's going to end by the first 20 minutes, you're the kind of simpleton I'm not surprised hit the movie with 4-5 stars, and you were probably yelling so excitedly spittle was dripping from your special needs lips while he was waving around his baby sword at the end... Which was one of the stupidest endings I've ever had to endure.

The effects are beautiful, some of the characters aren't totally boring, and a line or two made me almost chuckle... But all and all, this ""movie"" is just a really boring rendition of ""The Dresden Files"" (My daughter's furby even fell asleep).",1453334400,,1925,4.587209302325581

The word ""mediocre"" pegs this movie perfectly.  Heartless story, yet great acting.  Wonderful effects, not often used.  And when they are, not much imagination put into them.  The main bad witch's monster, for example, looks like a jet engine surrounded by twigs.  Very stupid.  Easily beaten too.

In a world before mankind, these creatures lived.  And all that they have access to is a twig monster?  No other creatures?  No variations on the witches' looks?  No other creatures lived among them?  I thought this was fantasy?

Where is he from?  Why?  We get these nonsense flashbacks that tell us nothing.
