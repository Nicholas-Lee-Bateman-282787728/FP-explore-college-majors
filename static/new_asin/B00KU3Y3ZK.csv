8661686,5,B00KU3Y3ZK,"Many people are unaware of how organizations like Autism Speaks (and other Autism organizations not led by actually autistic people) harm autistic people and their families, how this contributes directly to the ableism, stigma, abuse, and murder of autistic people. This film is a good introduction to why the vast majority of actually autistic people oppose, protest, and speak out against them. If you want to go deeper into the subject, you can check out [...] or basically any blog or book written by an actually autistic person. If you are looking to contribute to an autism organization that actually is run BY and FOR autistic people, I recommend either Autism Women's Network or the Autistic Self Advocacy Network.

CONTENT WARNING: This film shows footage of the torture and abuse that takes place at the Judge Rotenburg Center (which Autism Speaks promotes and supports) which involves shocking their residents with high powered electric shocks repeatedly for violations such as not sitting still, etc. People have died from this ""treatment"" in the JRC's ""care."" The Autistic Self Advocacy Network and other groups of autistic advocates have been fighting against this for years. Finally the FDA is proposing a ban on this practice, but we shall see what happens.",1462060800,6,1273,5.14975845410628

This documentary is quite anti Autism Speaks, and breaks down why Autism Speaks is so offensive to those on the spectrum. It also features some of the players in this civil rights movement. I bought this movie because my eight year old autistic son has always been interested in human rights and I am bringing him up to understand how he too can be an advocate.",1427068800,11,435,4.518987341772152
