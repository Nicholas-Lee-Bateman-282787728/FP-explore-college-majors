2169468,5,B00065BEOA,"I've never done a workout this effective and fun.  The Elite Forces video works muscles I never even knew existed.  Since Katrina Barillova is a former intelligence agent, she really kicks it into gear for this exercise program.  You don't need any equipment and you begin burning fat and building lean muscle the moment you get going. The more I do it the more I like it!  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants real results!",1059436800,6,424,4.5394736842105265
2169469,2,B00065BEOA,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a very challenging workout.  The ""missions"" are entertaining, and the DVD was very creatively designed, even allowing you to turn off the music it comes with so you can listen to just the instruction and your own music.  However, the important parts, the workouts, greatly disappointed me.  The DVD set is split into 4 parts.  The first is Basic, which just teaches you basic moves - once you know them, you'll never need it again.  Then you have Combo, Shadowboxing and Cardio.  I've looked at them all, and just completed Shadowboxing.  Each of the workouts is only 45 minutes long!  In addition, each one starts for 5 minutes, then once your heartrate is up and you're good and pumped, you have to stop to stretch your lower body for 5 min.  Why not do all the stretching before beginning cardio segments??  Also, the last 10 min or so are devoted to stretching.  So what you're left with is 25 minutes where your heartrate is continually up.  The Shadowboxing segment was not challenging at all.  It is very basic and I hardly broke a sweat.  I've done tae kwon do in the past, and I take a kickboxing class that is much more difficult than anything on the DVD.  From tae kwon do training, I agree with the other reviewer who pointed out that Katrina's form is often bad and several of the backup people have much better form.

I'll try the other two segments tomorrow, but I'm not expecting much better, b/c from watching the cardio I could see it follows a similar format - warm-up the upper body, then stop what you're doing to stretch lower body, etc.  If I am trying to get a real workout, I expect it to be longer and much more intense.  This makes me very happy I only paid around $12 for this set.  I recommend sticking with The Firm.  Hopefully my TaeBo tapes will arrive soon, I look forward to trying those out.",1129852800,9,1881,4.476470588235294
2169470,5,B00065BEOA,"I have used all of the dvds in this set over and over, and I love them all.  I always get a great sweat going when I'm working out, and I'm a daily exerciser.  The workouts are challenging, and fun without being ridiculous.  Very simply, they're great for cardio, excellent for upper body toning, and very good for lower body toning.  (I've been using them for just a couple of weeks now, and I'm losing some weight and more body fat.) Using these videos is like taking a fun boxing class in the comfort of your own home, and all the moves are classics that endure, rather than the newest fads that get silly or boring with repeated use.

  I've only watched the ""missions"" that you can choose to watch before each workout once each.  While I appreciate that they're cute and well-produced, and while I love the motivational, bad-a** aspect of Katrina's victories, the vignettes are a bit cheesy and I'd rather get right to the excellent workouts.

  While the price is daunting, the set is absolutely worth it - the best at-home workout experience I've ever had.  Plus, using these videos at home is saving me the time I used to take out of my day to work out at the gym, and now the videos are saving me a ton of money because with the great results I'm getting with daily use, I've quit the gym!",1124928000,5,1298,4.384937238493724
2169471,5,B00065BEOA,"Oh, this one is a blast.  I don't think it's as serious a workout as, for example, the Tae Bo that is my favorite, but it is so funny, fun to watch, and informative.  I haven't done all of the episodes yet, but I love the ""sexy"" vignettes, and the way they go over form and teach you how to wrap your wrists for when you are actually going to make contact (with a heavy bag, for example).  The stuff that one learns here could easily be expanded on one's own into other workouts.  Highly recommended for anyone with a sense of humor.  This can be hard to find but look around and you may find a better priced copy elsewhere.",1107129600,9,624,4.12396694214876
2169472,5,B00065BEOA,"This DVD set consists of three separate workouts depending on your mood (toning, shadowboxing and cardio), my favourite is the cardio which consists of moves based on punches, knees, kicks and squats.  This workout gets your heart rate up and works up a very decent sweat.  The music is the best I've found in a workout DVD, it's very cool and very addictive.  The DVD can be a little cheesy a times i.e. ""the missions"", however I consider this set of workouts to be one of the best purchases, if not the best in my collection which consists of over 40 fitness DVD's.  I would definately recommend this for anybody looking for exciting, challenging workouts that are visually appealing and present a very polished production.",1092700800,15,725,4.776
2169473,5,B00065BEOA,"As I've gotten older (and wiser) I've bought fewer workout videos because so many are just trash. (Who cares if some MTV kids can dance to a beat?  That's no workout!)  The Elite Forces DVD set  has done the one thing I never thought possible: It motivates me to workout because I don't dread the exercises or the instructor.  With almost all the other workout videos I've used, I'll usually watch a workout once, and be distracted trying to do the exercises.  By the second or third time I watch I'm bored with the exercises, and irritated by the sickeningly-sweet instructor.  This video has a totally different look, (the sets/background have kind of a techno-gym feel) and a group of people to learn the exercises from. It has really kept my attention as with this set I don't watch my clock for ""how much longer is this thing.""  I find that I am distracted by the visuals, music and instruction, and  time really flies by when I'm working out.  For me, exercise is the only thing that helps me keep my weight under control, so a video that helps me keep my brain busy while working out is just what I need.  This one is IT!",1084838400,17,1128,4.432038834951456
2169474,5,B00065BEOA,"I searched online for hours trying to find the perfect workout DVDs...  and I found this one!  I was VERY skeptical about paying $60 for this product, but I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.  This was the best $60 I've spent in a while!!  I highly recommend this package for anybody who is looking for getting into regular workouts (they do have modified exercises for beginners) or who is looking for a new challenge.  This is a GREAT buy!",1084665600,10,458,4.404761904761905
2169475,5,B00065BEOA,"As a person who has for the last 30 plus years been involved in and taught classes in the martial arts, general fitness, aerobic karate/kickboxing, and weight training, I find it difficult to locate training media that is able to hold ones interest past a couple of work-outs. This training video by Katrina Barilova, is both inventive, and imaginative. I say inventive in that it introduces some new technology which is on the cutting edge, and imaginative in it's application. I am very excited about the possibilities that I see on the horizon for the ""Elite Forces"" training video media that is coming down the pipeline. If you're looking for something a little different, and a work-out that can be molded to your personal situations, this may be the exercise media for you.",1075680000,11,779,4.864661654135339
2169476,5,B00065BEOA,"Now, I'm pretty picky when it comes to workout DVDs. I like them fast, I like them tough, and I like them to be flexible. I don't want them to get boring, and I want them to look good. I was a bit skeptical when I coughed up the $60 for this set of workout DVDs, but from the first moment I put it in my DVD player and started watching it, I was impressed.
First off, the production values are incredibly good for a workout video. It feels more like you're working out along to a movie, rather than just another workout video. Second, the workouts really are challenging, but not so challenging that you could never do them. ""Max"" is encouraging and relentless, but also tells you to take breaks and keep moving if you get tired.
""Basics"" is an important first step to this video. Even if you want to skip it, you should go through it at least once, because it'll teach you proper form. Particularly if you have bad knees like I do, you'll want to watch it for the section on roundhouses, or other moves that tend to impact the knees.
""Combo"" puts together all kinds of moves - from kickboxing to cardio to Pilates and other kinds of mat work. It's sort of the ""beginner to intermediate"" workout, if you consider that a total beginner can take a lot of breaks and work up to the challenge over time.
""Shadowboxing"" is so much fun. It's like Tae Bo in that you're doing kickboxing, but most of it is free-form. This means that you are given instruction on which moves and combinations you're working on, and then you get to do it at your own pace. You then combine this with slightly more choreographed sequences, and you've got a kickboxing workout that will never get boring.
""Cardio"" is hard. It's really hard. But it's not impossible, certainly. It's something to work toward, and you'll feel triumphant when you make it through.
This DVD set is a group of tough, total-body, no-nonsense workouts that look really great. Bonuses are 3D wireframe models that tell you which muscles you're working, and countdown clocks that tell you exactly how much time your workout has left, and how much time you're spending on each section. Another bonus are the fun little spy movies - called ""missions"" - that begin each section (but you can skip these if you want). This set of DVDs, done regularly, will definitely whip you into the best shape of your life.",1073952000,52,2351,4.4953271028037385
2169477,5,B00065BEOA,"After browsing Amazon's fitness section for over an hour, I decided to buy the Elite Forces Rapid Readiness Workout. The main reason I purchased this DVD was it really looked like it had something different to offer. (It has a girl with a gun on the cover, now that's different!)
At first glance I thought it looked a little expensive, but when I checked the DVD details, I noticed it had 4 volumes, additional features, and some graphics called M.A.S.S. I'm not the kind of person who reads instruction manuals, so I skipped the Basics volume and went right on to the Shadowboxing Workout. (Later I realized skipping it was a mistake. When I finally watched the instructions it explained how to do the kicks and punches.)
Let me tell you, the Shadowboxing Workout was TOUGH! I didn't finish the entire workout the first couple of times, but I've done it all the way through now.  The other workouts are called Combo and Cardio. I love the Combo, it has kept me interested, and I have used it the most. It's has a lot of different motions, kicks and punches and really keeps me on my toes. 
The Cardio workout (I must admit), I started, but couldn't keep up. But instead of slowing down what is a fast workout, I've decided to save that one for when I'm in a little better shape. (Yes, it's THAT Hard!)
All the volumes start with a little video, these are called ""missions."" In the missions, some bad guys (and girls) are trying to get the star of the video. I was really surprised to see her parachute to a roof-top in one! In another she's attacked while taking a bath, well, you get the idea. They are fun to watch, but do not last long enough for you to forget about why you are in front of the tv, TO EXERCISE! I don't watch them every time I workout, but I have noticed some of the workout moves I've learned used for self-defense in the missions. (I told my husband he'd better not bother me when I'm in the bathtub. ;)
So, while I would DEFINITELY recommend this video, I do have a word of caution: Pick an open area of your house to workout in. (I kicked over a lamp during my first workout!)",1064448000,26,2101,4.357142857142857
8039029,3,B00065BEOA,"The opening scenes trying to set the stage for the idea that you will be excellent at self defense after doing this video, such as Katrina being attacked in the bathtub by an assailant who breaks into her house, are cringeworthy.  The assailant is another person working out in the video.  It is in the style of P90X, so in each section it notes the time spent working out or time left for that section.  Cueing is not great either.  It is an ok workout but there are better made ones out there.",1390262400,,495,4.290322580645161
8039030,1,B00065BEOA,"I have a great library of workout DVDs that I love and use daily, so I decided to add this one based on the reviews and the demands of my inner-nerd-who-secretly-wants-to-be-a-badass.

This DVD was a disappointment. Just terrible.

1. I seriously doubt Katrina has ever been trained in combat or martial arts. Her form was awful and incorrect for everything, even a basic push-up. I hate to be critical of anyone's body, but if it's worth it for you to know, she wasn't a great example of fitness in terms of what sort of shape she was in. Yes, she is slender, but zero tone, zero definition. I thought she was a beautiful woman, but nevertheless, what I just said was worth a mention if you like your instructors a little more motivating.

2. The missions were campy and bizarre. I found them entertaining just because they were so goofy. I felt like I was watching a low-budget porn, but without the nakedness.

3. The instructional video was bad. I have been boxing for over 2 years in class and with DVDs, and I have never seen anyone throw a hook like that. Wtf?

4. The workouts themselves were just oddly laid out and sort of haphazard. It did nothing for me and I had to do one of my trusty boxing DVDs after this to get a real workout in.

This marks my very first return of a workout DVD. This was definitely a cool concept, and would have been awesome if it was done with some real professionals and executed better. Maybe Elite Forces Workout v 2.0?",1308873600,2,1461,4.412639405204461
8039031,1,B00065BEOA,"This is my least favorite workout video. With experience in kickboxing, tae bo, and kenpo, this workout was just not good.  The announcer's voice echos and he is hard to follow.  He doesn't keep count and tells you to punch randomly so I felt like I had to make up my own routine.  He doesn't work out both arms evenly (he does a better job working the legs evenly). It's frustrating when he calls out the next move before you're finished with the current one - he was even confusing the people in the video.",1301616000,,508,4.326315789473684
8039032,5,B00065BEOA,"I am pregnant now so I cannot use this dvd for a while but I have had it for a few years now and I love it!  This dvd will whip you in to shape and is not for the faint of heart!  Beginner exercisers may want to look elsewhere for something less intense.  I look forward to being able to do this dvd again after my baby is born as I really enjoyed all of the 3 different workouts included.  The recording is very professional looking, almost like a movie.  The shadowboxing and cardio sessions are my 2 favorites.  If you want an intense dvd that is fun to watch, easy to follow along with, and really gets your heart rate up this is it!  I highly recomment this dvd!!!!",1238025600,2,670,4.068702290076335
8039033,5,B00065BEOA,"After being a diehard Tae-Bo fan for many years, I was hoping there was something else out there that could compete.  I found exactly what I was looking for in this DVD set.  As a competitive 5K runner, I'm always excited to find cross-training opportunities (particularly in the winter months).  I despise wimpy videos/DVDs!  This one is great!  You are very much in control of how intense of a workout you get.

My only real complaint is Ms. Katrina.  Come on -- do you really need to workout in cleavage-revealing outfits when everyone else is in athletic wear?!?  If you can get over the wardrobe malfunctions, then these workouts are for you!",1179100800,,647,4.714285714285714
8039034,5,B00065BEOA,"I really like this video. It is a lot of fun and a great workout. There are four different workouts that come with the disk and I have done all, but the basics. I am a blackbelt in Taekwondo and have taught aerobics. I am in pretty good shape, but this set could work for pretty much anyone. My boyfriend even enjoyed the shadow boxing segment and he is a hardcore weight lifting guy. Another thing I appreciate is that the workout incorporates a lot of stretching which is really important and often neglected.",1172448000,4,511,4.446808510638298
8039035,5,B00065BEOA,"I'm a kickboxing enthusiast--probably at an intermediate level--and have tried many of the kickboxing workout DVDs available. With the possible exception of live classes (in which I've also participated), this is the best one out there. I have owned this for about 8 months, and I continue to do the workouts 1-3 times each week. The main reason I think this set is so excellent is that, once you become familiar with the workouts, you will find that they are so well called that you could do them by sound alone--listening to the trainer (Max) without watching at all. He also has a way of encouraging and driving you to work harder.

The sets are stylish while still maintaining clear visibility so that you can easily see what they are doing. The camera angles never get in the way of your ability to see how the move should be performed; if they want to show you a close-up, they split the screen so that you see both the detail and the overall move. An on-screen graphic pops up unobtrusively to highlight the muscles worked, and a timer quietly counts down the time remaining in the workout.  If the move is particularly challenging (for example, planks or speed drills) an additional timer pops up and counts down just that move. They manage to do all of this in a way that enhances the workout, rather than detracting from it.

The negatives: (1) The participants don't always have correct form. For example, Katrina Barrillova doesn't turn her hand palm-down when throwing a front or cross punch, and one of the ladies in the back has floppy wrists at times, but these are minor things that need not detract from the workout. Just watch someone else. (2) Editing mistakes. There is one place where you can tell that they performed the moves--a series of lunges--at a slower speed and then increased it during editing/production to make you move faster. This is probably the thing I like the least about it. They should really do the work too! And there is one place where Max forgets to call a change in the number of punches thrown when counting down from 2 on each side for the combo to 1 on each side, but it only happens the once that I've been able to discover, which isn't bad considering the generally excellent job.

Using these DVDs regularly has improved my core and upper body strength remarkbly. I can now do push-ups on my toes and hold the plank moves (even the side planks), which I couldn't do before. I increase the effectiveness by using weighted gloves, though the DVDs demonstrate using hand weights. I also have better balance because of that core strength improvement, which I notice in my ability to do kicks at half speed--relying on muscle strength instead of momentum--and hold yoga balance poses that I was never able to accomplish before. (I don't much like yoga because I prefer a more dynamic form of exercise, but I do feel it worth mentioning based on a DVD I borrowed that included yoga poses in the cool-down.) My flexibility has also improved, as demonstrated by my higher kicks.

I also think it's worth applauding them for putting the stretches after a short warm-up. You can't stretch a cold muscle, so bravo! The cool-down stretches are also some of the most truly soothing and relaxing that I've encountered.

I've only watched the Basics once and I only refer to the missions on occasion, but they are fun features to get you started.

Last, but certainly not least, these workouts are just plain fun. No matter how out of sorts I am when I begin, once I get into the punches and kicks I often find myself grinning because I simply feel great and am enjoying the experience of the workout. I can't wait until the new Fitness Intelligence Workout set is available!",1167868800,5,3713,4.642313546423136
8039036,5,B00065BEOA,"I love Tae-Bo and have been using his tapes for years and wanted a change,something that wasn't a Billy Blanks rip off or cheesy and I found it with this DVD.

I love the movie xtra, and the diagram on the side which tells us what muscle were working out with a timer. The moves are orignal, martial arts and boxing (both real not ripped BB rip offs), you get 2 dvd with different moves that you can alter, the scencery and music are cool not corny. Now saying all that I wouldn't spend $60.00 for it but  instead buy it used for less. Also, if they ever do another video and I hope they do maybe Naki should be the host she seemed more energic than Katrina.",1142121600,6,658,4.1328125
8039037,5,B00065BEOA,"This workout is one of the most difficult work out videos I've dealt with.  I haven't sweated this hard since I stop running track in college.  The first work out (The basics) is cool, it teaches you basic form and footwork and lays the ground work for the other three workouts.  The following three (Combo, Shadow boxing, and Cardio) are serious.  The Combo workout is approximately 35 minutes, the other two are about 45 minutes.  I felt very muched worked over when I did any of the workouts.  The Combo workout used weights and emphasized strength little more than the other two, but they were all great workouts.  If you are looking to sweat (hard) and lose some weight, buy this DVD.  I would not suggest this DVD to anyone who is not use to mid to high intensity workouts.  This work out is no joke.",1137542400,10,806,4.465753424657534
8039038,5,B00065BEOA,"I am a long-time martial arts enthusiast, and feel really guilty if I can't make it to my gym every day.  So I made a resolution to do some kickboxing videos at home or wherever I am (if I have a room when I travel, which I do a lot).  A friend has recommended this video to me as a truely entertaining piece, so I thought at first it was going to be some gimmick with a little workout value.  But once I got it I not only loved the look and feel (it actually looks like a movie, it has great special effects showing which muscles you are working out), but it is also a terrific workout.  What I like most about the workout is that I can determine how difficult or easy I want it by changing my resitance, for example in Combo some cast members do the exercises without any weights, while others do the same kicks and punches using hand weights - I also like ankle weights for my kicks - really gets my heart pounding (as if the kicks weren't hard enough on their own - what can I say, I like to take it to the limit).  I love Shadowboxing especially, because it is a free style workout - you don't have to follow any specific routine to the music, you can do the exercises at your own pace and strenght based on the examples that you are given at the beginning of each set (there are 20 or so sets).  I have to watch myself here though, because it is so easy to slack off and get lazy when I start getting tired since it is totally up to me to how easy or strenuous I make it.  (If you are a beginner this would be a good one to start with so you can ease your way into this kind of workout.)  But when I had a bad day at work and I need to get rid of my frustrations watch out!  The beg gets it!  Oh, this is also great - when I don't have a beg, I can also do all of these exercises without it.  I usually do combo when I travel bacause it is mostly body and muscle shaping workout and I don't have to have a lot of room to do it.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to everyone from a beginniner to advanced, since you are in charge of the difficulty level yourself, has a really good timeless routines and moves (a nice mixture of classics and new ones), will shape you up really good, has a great music (especially shadowboxing) and is a lot of fun to watch too.",1130371200,,2271,3.967032967032967
