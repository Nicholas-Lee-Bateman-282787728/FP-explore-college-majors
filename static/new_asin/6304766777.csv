924141,5,6304766777,"My favourite movie. Drive into the hypnotic outback town of Sunray and adjust your attitude accordingly. Two small-minded sisters and two over-sized silos hardly sound like the basis for a plot. However,introduce a jaded sleazo DJ in exile from Brisbane,throw in a singing,nudist Chinese restauranteur,smother with a liberal coating of agendas(both obvious and hidden)and you have a very dark comedy. Comedy because it makes you laugh and dark because it makes you think. Certainly,the search for the ideal partner will never seem the same again. Neither will beef and black bean sauce. This film probably holds tremendous appeal for a potentially limited audience and as such may never achieve the acclaim it truly deserves.",982972800,8,725,5.368421052631579
924142,3,6304766777,"Dimity & Vicki-Ann Hurley (Otto & Frith) are two sisters living in a small ""nothing ever happens here"" town called Sunray in Australia. They are a pair of misfits and they often fail to get on together but they are sisters and sticking together is important to them. One thing that they both share is that they are single and are looking for a man. Then one day big-city DJ Ken Sherry (Shevtsov) moves to town. Not just to town but he moves in next door to the sisters.
The movie revolves around the attempts of each sister to to claim Ken as her man. Ken meanwhile is not interested in being claimed but he enjoys his dalliance with and manipulation of both women. This leads to conflict between the sisters and their relationship is sorely strained but, in the end, it is more important to them than Ken.
That's the plot and there is not a lot to it and there is not a lot going on in the way of sub-plots either but the point of the movie is the humour especially in the relationship between the sisters as each tries a new ruse to win Ken's attention.
Otto and Frith do a fine job here. A comedy double act demands a lot and most of the really successful ones have been between long established twosomes. Otto and Frith have not done this sort of thing together before and yet they deliver a series of gags both scripted and visual with real polish.
Shevtsov too does a fine job as the DJ who is past his best and, knowing this, looks for a small pond in which he is able to be a big fish.
My only real criticism is that the film is a little too long. It certainly does not need one hundred minutes to tell the story and the film would have more punch if some of the slower parts and weaker gags were cut.",972345600,2,1709,4.181818181818182
924143,4,6304766777,"As ""Dimitry"", the ""odder"" of two sisters, Miranda Otto made quite an impression on me. I'm glad to have made her acquaintance through this charming film, which threw a new surprise at me every time I  thought it might be wearing a bit thin. ""Ken Sherry"", the disc  jockey who actually believes in his ""Desiderta"" B-S, is an  unforgettable character.",960163200,,349,4.783333333333333
924144,5,6304766777,"I abolutely LOVED this movie!  Both sisters and Ken Sherry were delightfully quirky and amusing.  Its a great movie that is NOT predictable and is so interesting and funny. The acting is GREAT on all parts, the  restaurant owner was a special treat. I would highly recommend this movie  if you like more low key indie movies like Trees Lounge and Kicking and  Screaming and the fantabulously underrated She's So Lovely.",954028800,5,419,4.845070422535211
924145,5,6304766777,This is the type of movie that seems to come out of left field to plaster a smile on your face. There are some really HUGE laughs along the way in this story of a disc jockey who moves to a small town and next to two  sisters.  Let the insanity begin.,944611200,2,251,3.8076923076923075
924230,4,6304766777,"Saw this movie years ago and was glad to find out the title and purchase it. It was funny, quirky and shocking at the end.

924231,5,6304766777,"I can't get enough of this movie and must have watched it at least ten times. Got tired of renting and finally decided to buy. It's a bit dated now, having an 80's theme, but the plot is excellent and the characters true to life and rich. As I live in Australia, it's a real slice of ""Down Under."" Especially the small, stagnant towns in the ""bush."" There are some real ""characters"" in Australia and this movie captures a few of them.  Was suprised to hear that the stuntman died while making this movie.",1267574400,2,504,4.361702127659575
924232,5,6304766777,"This Austrialian film is very unusual, but excellent!  First of all, it only has 4 main characters!  Two lonely sisters live together in the small, almost deserted, back-water town of Sunray located by the Murray River.  The final character is the owner of the town's Chinese restaurant where one of the sisters work.  I guess you could count the River and the town as characters as well as the music of Berry White!

There is not much back story in the dialogue, but thanks to widescreen you can tell that the sisters never left home after taking care of a ill parent(s) who are now gone and never mentioned.  Also, Vicki Ann (Rebecca Firth) who is the older sister) says to Dimity(Miranda Otto) that, ""I have done nothing all my life but take care of you.""

Vicki Ann, who is the brash, pink and perky sister, has never been lucky in love and Dimity has never experienced love.  Also, simmering under the dialogue, you get the impression that Dimity, who is shy and insecure, is the towns odd ball.

Both are looking for love, although the prospects in Sunray seem bleak, at best. That is, until Ken Sherry (George Shetsov), a thrice divorced Brisbane DJ personality, moves into the house next door.

You think you know what is going to happen and to some extent you do, but the twist and turns are unique.  You'll never see the ending coming, and I won't spoil it for you.

Highly recommend!",1266451200,2,1394,4.554216867469879
924233,4,6304766777,Funny reptilian sometimes profound even surreal sex comedy about world weary DJ thinking he can string along two sisters in a sleepy one-horse outback town in Australia.  Amazing deadpan performances from the cast who clearly relish the near perfect script but especially from George Shvetsov as the DJ who proves that sexual magnetism has nothing to do with conventional good looks.,1264204800,,383,5.278688524590164
924234,4,6304766777,I am a huge fan of Muriel's Wedding and this movie is a little bit reminiscent.  I liked it.  It's very quirky and fun.  Something different!,1242172800,,141,4.346153846153846
924235,5,6304766777,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)

Ken Sherry (George Shevtsov), a tall, divorced, sleazy, and a bit in love with himself disc jockey from Brisbane comes to the tiny berg of Sunray to take over disc jockeying duties at the local radio station.  He likes to spin platters with deep vocals from seductive male voices like Barry White's while spewing out tidbits of philosophy and poetry designed to enthrall the ladies.  In the house next door to the one he has acquired, live two unmarried sisters, Dimity (Miranda Otto) and Vicki-Ann (Rebecca Frith) who toss out the lures in the hope of landing such a catch.

(The fishing metaphor here and those to follow are appropriate because at one point Dimity notices that Ken has a kind of scar on his neck making her think he has gills.  Additionally he has a marlin on one of his walls, although he won't eat fish.  Furthermore, in the opening scene of the movie, Dimity and Vicki-Ann are actually fishing.)

Anyway, for the girls the lesson here is be careful what you fish for since the catch of your dreams might turn out to be the tomcod of your nightmares.  Dimity is younger, virginal and a bit odd.  She's a waitress at the local Chinese restaurant.  Older sister Rebecca is slightly desperate and on the make.  She runs the town's beauty parlor.  As the competition for Ken heats up they decide they hate each other.  At first the younger sister Dimity seem to have him hooked, but then Rebecca seems to be hauling him in and headed for matrimonial bliss, so much so that she opens her trousseau and takes out her wedding gown to try it on and show him..., and then....
Well, the key here is that the script and direction by Shirley Barrett is just so diabolically clever and so full of keen insights into the psychology of men and women, especially women, that it is just a riot.  Otto manages the sweet innocence and naivet of a 14-year-old, although she is supposed to be twenty.  The expressions she gets on her face are just so, so funny.  I loved the scene where she is on Ken's couch and he is sitting arrogantly on the other end and at length asks her if she wants to be kissed.  Yes, she does; and the way she slides over to him, bit by anxious bit, was just too funny.  I also loved the scene where Ken is on top of her and she is lying on her back looking up at ceiling (at the camera of course) with an somewhat puzzled, pleased and expectant expression on her face, as if she is searching for what she is supposed to be feeling while Ken mechanically continues to do what he is doing.

Also good is the scene near the end, high in the silo, where Ken is explaining something to Rebecca.  The camera is on him, but directly behind him we see Dimity's face smiling in some delight as if she knows how this is going to end.  (And she does.)

I thought it was interesting that the small town of Sunray, Australia could have easily been Sunray Kansas or Sunray, Ohio, so much was it like a typical small American town.  I also found apt how the soundtrack of seductive hits from the seventies, ""Love Serenade"" itself, and two others by Barry White, but also ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" by Billy Paul, mirrored Ken Sherry's ""philosophy"" of love and meshed well with his deep, sonorous voice.  The song ""My Coo Ca Choo"" by Alvin Stardust played near the end was apparently a hit in Australia, but this was the first time I'd heard it.  Good song.

See this for Shirley Barrett who simultaneously satirizes both male and female sexuality in a manner that would have delighted Oscar Wilde and any number of comedy writers, and for Miranda Otto who was both funny and charming.",1216598400,9,3745,4.422740524781341
924236,4,6304766777,"Very unusual movie.  But I was totally suprised by how good it was.  I did not recognize any of the characters, but they were exceptional in their roles.  I highly recommend this movie.  there was one thing I didn't understand??  Why was Ken Sherry a fish??",1194739200,,257,4.5
924237,5,6304766777,This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. The characters are well written and the plot does not easily give itself away. Watch it again for the foreshadowing.,1162425600,,161,4.586206896551724
924238,4,6304766777,"LOVE SERENADE is an offbeat (I'm trying terribly hard to avoid the word `quirky') story of two sisters in a rural Australian town who find themselves in an increasingly acrimonious competition for the affections of the big city disk jockey who'd just moved in next door.

  It's a tale of seduction, jealousy, and `wuv' played out between three compelling and convincing characters.  At least they convince up to a point.

 The last ten minutes or so contains scenes that are shocking and bizarre.  The bizarre element, even though a hint or two is dropped during the movie, seems to have been inserted to take the sting out of the shocking element.

  The core story, minus the strange stuff, was a plenty good enough movie for me.",1104364800,,732,4.738095238095238
924239,5,6304766777,"Love Serenade is a one-off and highly novel arthouse movie based upon largely unknown actors and a narrow and quirky plot. This is very much a slow burn and it won't appeal to some, while others will be coming back again and again. The movie starts when big time dag, and one time DJ ""Ken Sherry"" rolls into a dead-end Australian outback town in his dated brown RX7 to the sound of one of Barry White's more seedy tunes. No sooner has Ken arrived on the scene than two backward country sisters, (one fiesty, one clueless and both desperate) start their own amateurish fight for Ken's effections. Ken is a big town sleaze who takes it upon himself to take full advantage of both naive sisters while spouting his own poetic brand of self-justifying hedonistic philosophy. With the local Chinese chef and nudist Albert as the self-appointed voice of reason (and superstition) the whole plot becomes increacingly bizzare. The ending really takes the cake and is a great moment the first time you see it. I should add that Ken's most redeeming feature is that he plays great music tracks from the 70's on his radio station, and the soundtrack to this movie is extremely enjoyable and well worth hunting down on CD.",1055635200,11,1209,4.68075117370892

This movie has a Napoleon Dynamite feel to it. The film is very sensual and has an unusual plot that makes you question where the twists and turns will take you next ATTENTION SPOILER ALERT AHEAD.The story takes place in a small Australian town and things get crazy when a celebrity DJ from a large city to moves there to run the local radio station. Things start to get fishy between the DJ and two sister becoming a bizarre love triangle that will have you shocked.

7877195,5,6304766777,"There is simply something fundamentally wrong with Dimity and Vicki-Ann, lonely-heart sisters in Sunray, Queensland, back of nowhere.  Why the wheelchair?  Why the obsession with lounge lizard Ken Sherry?  Why are they so obviously mad as hatters?  Why does Sherry eat no fish yet has a giant marlin mounted on the wall?  Why all the casseroles left on his doorstep? Why did he leave big time radio and TV in Brisbane?  Why does he quote ""Desiderata"" (with due respect to Max Ehrmann, the most pretentious farrago ever twaddled)? Are there killer fish or black holes in the river?  And why has Chinese restauranteur Albert come to embrace nudism?  These and many other questions are not properly answered in the best Australian comedy film ever.  All comedy is black (as the saying goes) but for it to work somehow, you need actors to follow their mad, daring instincts and a director to give them the lead.  Miranda Otto (Dimity), Rebecca Frith (Vicki-Ann), George Shevtsov (Ken Sherry) and John Alansu (Albert) are perfect, as is this film.  It 'caught me on the hop.'",1421020800,,1070,4.856353591160221
