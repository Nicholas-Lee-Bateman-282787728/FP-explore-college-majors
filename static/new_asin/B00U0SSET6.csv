8703746,4,B00U0SSET6,"I saw Tip Top's listing in a catalog and the fact that it starred Isabelle Huppert was a big selling point for me.  I thought it a good film, one that had a complicated but intriguing plot involving the murder of a police informant.  Huppert and Sandrine Kiberlain play an offbeat pair of Internal Affairs investigators who have some personal quirks; Huppert's character is into sadomasochism and Kiberlain's is a voyeur (which makes for a funny scene when the former's husband shows up for their idea of a romantic evening).  The rest of the cast also draws in the viewer.  The information on the DVD case plays up the comedic angle, even suggesting a screwball comedy, but I would have to call this a drama with some humorous touches.  American viewers might find the ending as confusing.  Overall, those two qualifications aside, Tip Top is an interesting picture that has the viewer wondering just how the story is going to play out.",1432166400,2,937,4.753086419753086
