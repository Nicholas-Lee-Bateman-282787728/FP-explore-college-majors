8119327,3,B000F9T6Z6,"Okay, I should have written my review for the last Jimmy/Timmy Power Hour special before this one came out.  Maybe then this wouldn't be a huge step down for everyone involved...that may be my ego talking, but I don't care.
  Having apparently established a casual connection between their universes and a friendship to boost, a bored Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner briefly amuse themselves by taking down some of each other's enemies.  All of these battles lasting for a total of a minute, they decide to create their own super villain to battle, and that's when the trouble starts.
  For me, the trouble started long before that new ""villain"" even became an idea.  I would have been fine with more of Timmy and Jimmy's recurring enemies causing trouble for them both, but instead we get this thing which can ultimately bend space and time or something like that.  It was a desperate attempt to create a threat greater than those encountered in the last two specials which ultimately fell flat.
  Pretty much every character crossed over at one point or another...I'd like to see the therapy bills from all that.  Seriously, no one asked any real questions afterwards?
  I think this special was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the last two and, in the process, gave us nothing like the first two.  The introduction was rushed, the villain was boring, and everything just ended too neatly after this ""threat"" to both universes.  I did like A.J.'s story line and Chester was funny as always.  Some jokes worked and all the characters were true to how we knew them.
  It's definitely the weakest of the Jimmy/Timmy Power Hour trilogy but I've seen many specials that were worse.  If you want, go ahead and add it to your other two.  Enjoy.",1405209600,,1750,4.712871287128713

If you can tell me if the bonuse episode of jimmy when he and cindy get stuck on a island I think the name of the episode is called stranded. You can let me know by posting a  review by the dvd thanks.,1249344000,3,319,3.492957746478873
8119330,5,B000F9T6Z6,"PowerHour 3: The Jerkinators is a hilarious and wonderful mini-movie combining the worlds of Jimmy Neutron, the Boy Genius with the Big Head, and Timmy Turner, the Average Kid That No One Understands. (Hm! Someone should make a song about that!) Jimmy and Timmy meet again and quickly discover that with Jimmy's IQ and Timmy's Magic, they can defeat any enemy that they face. So they decide to make their own enemy, the superb Villain Whose Name Isn't Shirley. Chaos ensues! Jimmy and Timmy learn they need their other friends; Cindy, Libby, Sheen, Carl, AJ, and Chester.
Two great things make this DVD fantastic. First, the humor. Cosmo, Sheen, the Villain all have great lines. Way too many to list. Second, the movie features cameos of almost every character in each Universe - a snazzy concept. Teachers, parents, mayors, bullies. It's a regular Jimmy Timmy reunion. Very enjoyable.",1223424000,4,886,4.993243243243243
