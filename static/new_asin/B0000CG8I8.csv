1919155,2,B0000CG8I8,"...but most definitely strange, haunting, beautiful, boring, cold, cerebral, humorless, and disjointed.  I am a longtime admirer of Jonathan Miller, going way back to an LP we had of his comedy team, ""Beyond the Fringe""(hilarious pre-Monty Python skit humor) and his series aired on PBS in the late 70s, ""The Body In Question"", dealing with various aspects of human psychology and physiogomy in history and the present day.  Miller is an extremely bright, enthusiastic man who is also-I feel unfortunately-a bit of an intellectual snob-the kind who firmly eschews anything ""cute"", ""sentimental"" or ""sweet"".  Well, so do I-but I also love Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass"", and I was disappointed in the way Miller directed this BBC hour long film, circa 1966.  God knows ""Alice"" has been done to death in the most excrucuating fashion(No, I couldn't sit through that thing with Ann Jillian as the Queen of Hearts, produced by-wasn't it Alan Carr?!), bastardized and played around with with no understanding of the essential mood or appeal of the original stories.  But Miller, while making some really wonderful decisions--the black and white cinematography, the use of victorian, abandoned-looking, frequently decrepit locations(preceding but startlingly like the work of The Brothers Quay in the 80s), the direction of some of the actors--also errs in going way too far in the other, non-Disneyesque direction.  The result is frankly boring after about 20 minutes-and keep in mind I'm a really die-hard Alice 'scholar'.  This is a curiousity, not a ""masterpiece"". The style, which is an attempt to get the ""feel"" of a real dream, is just off-putting after the novelty wears off.  Unlike other reviewers here, I don't think the young actress playing Alice is bad, but she was apparently directed NEVER to make eye contact with any of the other characters, and while it does indeed give the impression of a sleepwalker-who wants to watch a sleepwalker for 60 minutes?  There's an audio track of Miller narrating the film, and while as I say I love the guy, he gives himself way too much credit for his very basic interpretation here(I mean, okay, he didn't force the actors to wear animal costumes, great-but I do NOT agree with his contention that the characters in the book really *aren't* meant to be animals at all).

Also, while I like Ravi Shankar's sitar music enought to own at least one of his CDs, I could have dispensed with its use as the score-the SOLE score-for this film(supposedly ""referencing the Raj""-come on!).  It unfortunately gives the thing the mood of an acid trip, rather than a haunting fantasy.  In sum-Alice fans and lovers of experimental cinema-definitely check this out.  Others: it's a less than even chance you'll be glad if you buy or even rent it.",1095552000,12,2829,5.032119914346895
1919156,1,B0000CG8I8,"The worst version I've ever seen.  The story is constantly modified to avoid special effects$$.  The Alice actress was instructed to be deadpan throughout, which is just as well because I get the impression she can't act anyhow. About the only fun is spotting Eric Idle (future Python) as an extra a couple of times.  Some of the changes seem amazing to me:  at the
beginning the sisters go into the field alone - no rowboat with Dodgson and Duckworth.",1088899200,5,452,4.6125
1919157,2,B0000CG8I8,"It seems I stand alone in not liking this version of Alice in Wonderland. Having read the book, I know what is happening, yet I feel people not exactly fimilar with the story (Disney's version isn't good enough)would find it dry and lacking in a good solid story persay. Things are very quickly jumped into, and hardly any lines on the part of Alice. She is compleltly out of it and stares blankly off into space most of the time. Over all I found this version of Alice lacking and dull.",1088553600,4,487,4.362637362637362
1919158,5,B0000CG8I8,"This is going to sound like a snobbish, Peter Greenaway appreciating review, but it wouldn't be the first time I've ostracized myself. This TV movie did something that no other version of Alice has done: It made Alice, as well as the viewer, realize what it is like to go insane. As opposed to the ""disneyland attraction"" type of adaptation where little Alice simply goes with the flow, this Alice grows madder as it continues, as do most of whom she encounters. The psycho sexual nuances are all there as well, not to mention wit and very VERY understated performances from the over the top likes of Peter Sellers, as well as a young Monty Python Eric Idle seen as an extra. The girl playing Alice, though not a skilled actress, relays with a mere glance to the camera what countless other snotty nosed little girls playing Alice have NOT been able to accomplish; A thoughtful, blase, knowing insanity. People will either get this film or they won't, but in many ways it's the best.",1079222400,12,983,4.622857142857143
1919159,5,B0000CG8I8,"What a surprise that a gem like this exists!!  I had never even heard that this was created until just recently.  The 4 previous reviews all have very good points so I won't go into great detail.  It is a disjointed affair, but well worth the trouble to delve into.  The girl chosen as Alice seems years too old for the role though.  If bizarre 60's movies are not something you are into, then I would advise those people against getting it.  If you like weird films like Wonderwall or shows like The Prisoner, you may be able to enjoy this film.  I find it fascinating and it is highly psychedelic.  There is no doubt that this is a 60's take on Alice.  Incredible camerawork with much detail put into camera angles and setting really add to the surreality of this work.  Leo McKern is hysterical as the Dutchess.  Peter Cook and Peter Sellers have some fun with their roles as do all the cast. No one has a very large role.  This looks like it was a blast to make and should entertain anyone with an open mind.  I would say that it is not geared toward children as many versions of Alice are.  Most little kids will be confused and possibly disturbed.  This is much more fun for grown-ups.  See if you can spot the Monty Python cameo.",1077494400,19,1236,4.308695652173913
1919160,5,B0000CG8I8,"This release of BBC-TV's 1966 black-and-white Alice in Wonderland is very fine indeed. The film is a surreal, theatrical, and dark ""Alice,"" designed as a dream version of Victorian life - there are no animal costumes here. The caucus race is a scene in a public school, the Caterpillar is a sort of headmaster, the trial is a massive church setting, and so on. Alice herself is almost completely impassive, and rarely speaks aloud; I found myself interpreting the whole thing as an autistic girl's skewed and nonsensical view of the world around her. Despite its short length, the film takes its time, and has a very dry sense of humor; I found it endlessly fascinating once I got into it, though. It's almost hypnotic - something greatly helped by Ravi Shankar's sitar music.
The picture quality is excellent, unusual for British TV of this period. Director Jonathan Miller personally contributes an excellent commentary track, discussing the film's themes, his actors, and why he felt a darker ""Alice"" needed to be made. The disc is rounded out with a short picture gallery, and a real surprise: the first-ever ""Alice"" film, a 10-minute silent from 1903, with commentary. Really my only complaint is the lack of subtitles for the feature film; Alice's own dialogue is frequently whispered, and to the casual ear can be hard to decipher. Otherwise, this is a great film with an excellent DVD presentation that demonstrates quality over quantity. I recommend it very highly.",1076889600,10,1474,4.97165991902834
1919161,4,B0000CG8I8,"This 1966 BBC-TV version of Lewis Carroll's classic story is, no doubt, one of the more strange and unusual versions of this tale that one is ever likely to see on film.  Filmed in black and white, and given a Victorian Gothic look; director Jonathan Miller voted against the usual presentation of talking animals and flashy visuals.  Instead, he presents a Wonderland firmly rooted in reality as seen through the distorted vision of a child's dream.  Instead of a fuzzy White Rabbit hopping hurriedly to keep his appointment, we get a fussy, hyper, and wild-eyed Victorian gentleman in white top hat and coat with bristling mutton-chop sideburns and mustache.  Also, some of Alice's dialogue is presented as a voice-over, as if we're reading her thoughts.  Alice herself rarely looks anyone in the eye and the conversations are very fractured.  Even her classic conversation with the Cheshire Cat leaves a sense of discomfort as we only see Alice, and not the Cat,during the scene.  Indeed, this Wonderland is a dark and sinister place compared to the brightly colored versions of Disney and Hallmark.
For the most part, the cast of this version reads like a Who's Who of British theatre and film.  Peter Cook makes for a delightfully daft Mad Hatter, while Peter Sellers makes for a loopy King of Hearts.  Sir John Gielgud is a dignified Mock Turtle, while Sir Michael Redgrave is a wonderfully pedantic Caterpillar.  Anne-Marie Mallik is solid as a somewhat distant Alice.  Leo McKern is definitely fun to watch as he cavorts in drag as the ugly Duchess.  Ravi Shankar's score perfectly captures the mood of this dark and wonderful film.
This DVD also has insightful commentary by the director, as well as an early 1906 silent film version of the story.  Overall, this is an excellent film version that captures the darker elements of Carroll's classic tale and is definitely worth your while.  However, this version might not appeal to youngsters who may be more inclined to the Disney or Hallmark versions.",1073001600,5,2011,4.928783382789318
1919162,4,B0000CG8I8,"If you are expecting a light cartoon version of Alice and Wonderland, you won't get it with this.
This is one of the wierdest versions of the story I have seen yet.  It is somewhere between a dream and a nightmare.  The story flows like a dream where scenes jump from one spot to another in a sort of almost episodic flow.  This version is also a satire of the British aristocracy and culture.
This was made for the BBC as a Christmas special in 1966.
The soundtrack is by Ravi Shankar.  The cast is composed of some of the best known names of British comedy and theatre. Among the cast Peter Cook  plays the Mad Hatter,  Peter Sellers is the King of Hearts, But the real scene stealer is Leo McKern as the Duchess(!).
All in all, this is a pretty dark version of the story. It is also one of the more ""British"".
The British release also has an 8 minute silent version from 1903, director's comentary, production stills and cast bios. The American release may have more or less of these things.",1067126400,82,994,4.345945945945946

1919169,5,B0000CG8I8,"This is the most complex movie rendering of Carroll's classic, and one of the stranger ones. It's a 1966 BBC production in black and white, and done on a shoestring budget. As a result, there's just about nothing in the way of special effects - and certainly no animal-shaped costumes for the dormouse, white rabbit, and all the others. Instead, the characters simply dress in a deliberately over-done Victorian style, probably put together by raiding the stock BBC costume closet.

But what characters! Peter Sellers (who played in other Alice movies as well) is the King of Hearts, Peter Cook is the Mad Hatter, Leo McKern is the Duchess(!), and that's just the start of this star-driven production. Ravi Shankar composed the music and performs much of it, giving an other-worldly sense that fits Carroll's dreamscape perfectly. It's a kind of dream continually on the edge of nightmare without ever quite crossing the line, the same feeling you get when watching ""The Prisoner"" TV series.

But Alice truly makes the story. Ann-Marie Mallik, in what may be her only acting role, was the perfect choice. She moves through the dream with all the reserve you'd expect of a browbeaten Victorian child, but with all the presence and a little insolence of a woman-child entering her teens. Although she's more observer than participant in most scenes, she conveys a quiet sense of being fully engaged in it all.

This isn't a disneyfied, silly production for children. Nor is it a surreal exaggeration like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jan-Svankmajer-s/dp/6305779635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jan Svankmajer's</a>&nbsp;(which I also enjoyed). It's a serious and baffling work. In that sense, it's more true to Dodgson's original work than any other Alice I've seen. This one has my highest recommendation.

1919170,5,B0000CG8I8,"Like other reviewers I guess I was expecting a warm-fuzzy Disney type adaption of Lewis Carroll's work and this is definately not that.
  I found it very helpful to watch the commentary by the director on the DVD. He explains very nicely why he chose the actors that he did and how he intentionally did not want them to wear animal costumes. He explains his choice of the girl he chose to play Alice very well and in depth.
  Until I watched the commentary I did not under stand why it was such a dark adaptation-but now have seen the light so to speak.
  I was interested in the acting career of Ms. Mallik who played Alice and i went to Wikipedia and apparently this is the only film she ever made. She ended up marrying a career Naval officer and i believe had four children and went to work in the banking field. The studio's even had a hard time finding her to give her some addtional money she had coming when they re-released this movie many years later.",1370131200,4,961,4.311111111111111

1919173,5,B0000CG8I8,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1966 version...
To use words such as ""unique' and ""unusual"" to describe anything having to do with Alice in Wonderland is like calling the ocean blue. Still, this particular telling of the ""Alice"" story takes a point of view separate and apart from any other. It's the only Alice I have seen so far where the characters are not in costume (animal costumes anyway). What? No White Rabbit? No. No Caterpillar? Nope. No Mock Turtle? Negative. They're there, but the actors are not in makeup. That and other attributes makes this wonderland world more ""real"" than others. Alice doesn't fall down a rabbit hole, she walks into a tunnel. She wanders through, not sets on a stage, but mostly real buildings. In other words she really never leaves this [purposefully created as B&W] world.

I find this fascinating. To manifest the Alice story in this way reinforces the idea that Alice in Wonderland is as much `archetypal' as anything else, and that a particular story teller can use the core elements of the Alice tale to make their own points. What is the point here? Perhaps it's the same as the point made in the closing credits of the original TRON, where a stop motion sequence of night freeway traffic in the ""real"" world mimics the mindless rush in the alternate-reality of the computer world that the lead character has just escaped from. Or maybe the film maker is suggesting what director Robert Altman said when commenting on the film; Six degrees of Separation, that in fact it may be more like only 3 degrees that separate us from each other... and by inference, one world from another, one reality from another.

In this production, thirteen year old Anne-Marie Mallik wanders through her wonderland in quiet observation. The actress looks more like the original John Tenniel illustration of Alice than perhaps any other. She rarely speaks, but we hear her thoughts. She is mostly expressionless throughout her ordeal, seemingly unaffected by it... certainly not succumbing to it. In fact, this Alice is so deliberately without emotion I started to wonder if writer/director Jonathan Miller was intending what George Lucas intended when he created C-3PO. Lucas wanted a face sans of all expression so that we, the audience, would each read in to the character what we would. Perhaps that is what Miller was seeking. Or perhaps I am just reading into Alice's look a bit too much. ;>

Miller actually does share his point of view about this Alice adventure in an article he wrote around the time the production was released on a British TV series called `The Wednesday Play' (google: ""startrader the wednesday play season six alice in wonderland"" for the article). Miller's point of view seems to be that in writing about Alice's trials and tribulations as she moved through Wonderland, Lewis Carroll was merely symbolizing the trials and tribulations of childhood. That explanation would help apply meaning to Alice's tendency to grow and shrink throughout her adventure, culminating in her ability to grow in size without the aid of potions or mushrooms in the final court scene, where the child stops allowing everyone to tell her what to do, and instead finally rejects the nonsense taking place around her.

A few closing notes... we are of course in the psychedelic 60's at the point this version of Alice is tendered. So if this kind of Alice were to be made it seems this would be its time. The movie is layered with original music from Ravi Shankar, the Sitar musician who inspired the Beatles to infuse Indian music into their own sound. The sitar and oboe based sound track adds a soothing, other-worldly layer to the video and produces a rather hypnotic, ""trippy"" feeling. By the way, watch for the placement of mirrors in this film. There is one passage at least where Alice's reflection reacts to what is happening while Alice herself remains motionless.

(PS - If you are a fan of dark and strange interpretations of Alice in Wonderland be sure to check out the film ""Alice"", by stop motion animator Jan Svankmajer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice/dp/6305779635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice</a>).

1919174,1,B0000CG8I8,"It is appropriate that this film version of Alice In Wonderland is in black and white, because it has drained all the color out of the wonderful story.  Presented with wit but no humor and imagination devoid of charm, it has reduced Alice's adventures to a drug-addled, disjointed jumble of unlikeable fragments.  The director may have been a wonderful stage director but his touch with film leaves much to be desired.

A great cast is mostly wasted.  This is the only film in which I have seen Peter Cook give a performance which isn't funny or even interesting.  John Gielgud comes off fairly well until he ends up flouncing about on the beach, at which point I wondered if we had somehow skipped to that other atrocity of 1966, Incubus with William Shatner.  Redgrave seems to be biting his tongue to keep from lashing out at the most irritating Alice (Anne-Marie Mallik) ever caught on film.

Director Miller includes many long, pointless shots of Alice staring off into space, for those who like such things.  Perhaps, as a comment on Victorian restrictions on women's behavior, Miller was going out of his way to show her doing nothing.  Alice's continual whispered voice-overs become even more insufferable than her stultifying silent close-ups after a while.

Others have commented on the failure of the characters even to suggest the animal qualities of the originals.  I won't add more except to say that it was a directorial choice, and not a good one.

Obviously there are many reviewers who disagree with my assessment.  To them I leave this film and Morvern Callar.",1343174400,2,1579,4.847014925373134
1919175,5,B0000CG8I8,"this was definitely worth it just to own the 1915 silent classic. the rest of the Dvd is pretty dissapointing for serious Alice fans. it features a awful, washed out transfer of the 1972 version with Fiona Fullerton that isn't worth a red cent, and it has a couple of the Disney silent film Alices which can be obtained elsewhere (i don't even know how this distributer got em), and i guess the 1966 cartoon, 'Alice in Paris' was kinda cute, but it was really more about the 'Madeline' books than about 'Alice in Wonderland', in short this Dvd was basically nothing special and had little to offer except the 1915 silent film.
  but if you want the silent film classic from 1915, this is well worth the five bucks. it's a great print of the film and the film itself is good fun for Alice fans or silent movie buffs. any film buff should find this first major film version of 'Alice' a real study and amusingly entertaining.",1332028800,,923,4.455621301775148

1919178,1,B0000CG8I8,"This movie is simply HORRID!  I bought it for two reasons:  1.  Great cast, including Peter Sellers, Leo McKern, John Gielgud, Michael Redgrave, et al.  2.  Ravi Shankar's film score.

With such an interesting tale as its basis, an awesome cast, and an incredibly talented film scorist, one would expect a totally imaginative and enjoyable result.

What is amazing is how a formula like this could produce such an abysmal failure!

Here's a quick rundown of some of the most glaring problems:

-- Black and white.  Come on, this was 1966.  Color had been perfected by then.  It might have been interesting to have done a ""Wizard of Oz"" thing and used Black and White in the beginning and ending, and color for the ""Wonderland"" scenes.  But B&W throughout the whole movie, when so much could have been enhanced by color?

-- There is ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT to this movie!  There is one scene in the beginning and another in the end that is outside of Wonderland.  Alice and her sister walk out to the middle of a field and sit down.  Alice lies back and dreams about Wonderland.  She then wakes up at the end of the movie and the two sisters walk back to their house.  There is virtually NO DIALOGUE outside of Wonderland and no hint of any story context.  While in ""Wonderland"" there is also no semblance of a plot or story line.  Just random meetings with random odd characters. And no connections between any scenes.

-- Unless someone is mentioned by name (""Mock-Turtle"", ""Doormouse"", etc), you have no way of knowing who is who.  ""Alice"" is populated by a wide variety of interesting creatures: The White Rabbit, The hookah-smoking Caterpillar, Griffin, Mock-Turtle, Doormouse, et al.  All of the strange creatures in the book are portrayed in the film as normal humans.  The film doesn't even pretend to indicate these are anything other than normal humans.  When the credits roll at the end, I saw there were ""crabs"" and was reminded of the Caterpiller.  But for the life of me, I don't remember seeing these or many other of the ""creatures"", simply because they were all normal humans in the movie and I noticed nothing indicating they were anything OTHER than humans!

So much of the charm of the book is totally lost.

-- Oh, big ""Special Effects"" here:  The Cheshire Cat is the only character played by a non-human, but is actually just a real house cat.  In the book he gradually disappears, leaving behind the famous ""Cheshire Grin"".  In the movie, they simply superimpose a photo of the cat's head up in the sky, and tell you he has no body.  BIG WHOOP!!

-- The actress who plays Alice was a total unknown and this was her only film.  Not surprising.  She is just a zombie walking through her part.  Absolutely no expression.

The film is just one very long, tediously boring nightmare.  There are brief moments that are given a spark by Leo McKern or Peter Sellers.  And when there is no dialogue, Ravi's music turns the film into something like a psychedelic dream.

If they had done the whole movie in color with Ravi's music running continuously, wrapped it in a plot and only included the more interesting scenes, this could have turned into a nice 1960's psychedelic ""trip"" movie.

That was more along the lines of what I was expecting when I purchased this disaster.  This was just a bad exercise in wasted talent!

Actually, one other rather humorous thing I should add:  my wife is a big Peter Sellers fan, but watched only around 5-10 minutes of the movie before giving up and going into the next room to read her Law book.  She is studying for Paralegal  You KNOW a movie is boring when someone chooses to read a Law book instead of watching a movie with one of her favorite actors!!!!

Do NOT waste your money on this DVD!

**** UPDATE  *****
I wanted to add an update to this in response to comments:  1.  I did not find the book to be as confusing as this movie; it has a charm that is totally missing in this movie.  And there are numerous other movie versions that are not anywhere near as confusing, disjointed or boring as this version.  2.  I have no problems blaming the BBC for the fact that this movie was in Black & White.  The fact is though, that it was a bad choice to do this kind of movie in B&W.  Especially when it has no other redeeming qualities.

And the purpose of my review was to discourage others from wasting their money on this DVD.  So I stand by everything in my original review.",1302566400,6,4430,4.52020202020202
1919179,5,B0000CG8I8,"This challenging 1966 production of Alice in Wonderland by the talented director Jonathan Miller can be watched over and over again with each viewing revealing new details and the great depth of the interpretation, but always while again stimulating the laughter that is inherent in the story.

And it's a real pleasure to watch the apparently effortless and nuanced performances by the old pros such as Gielgud, Redgrave, McKern, Sellers and Muggeridge, along with the usual presence in British productions of a large and very talented supporting cast.

The luminous black and white photography has been beautifully restored and is a pleasure to look at in itself while the music of Ravi Shankar and oboist Leon Goossens is refreshing and endlessly catchy in its melodies and rhythms.

The supplements include a drama by the renowned Dennis Potter about Lewis Carroll and the real Alice which indirectly helps to clarify many of the choices made by Mr. Miller in shaping his production.

Don't look for the dumbed-down, overly saccharine approach that Disney and others take to this and other children's stories but enjoy the knowledgeable-adult level approach taken by Mr. Miller. His commentary is very entertaining, throwing light on his overall approach and providing very many interesting details about the making of the film.

For my money, after viewing it on many occasions during four months, this DVD is a hidden treasure which is an incredible bargain at the price.",1287964800,12,1477,5.163179916317992
1919180,4,B0000CG8I8,"I really vacillated over whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. I've watched the film twice now (with and without the director commentary) and I can say that I do not fall into the ""this film is genius"" camp. What pushed it into four stars was the bonus features: the 1903 Hepworth version and the ""Alice"" docudrama (more about that in a bit).  I should add that I did not buy this through Amazon, and apparently some of the reviewers who did got a disc that was not the Miller movie.

Never having seen the film before, I found it too much a product of its time. Much like Austin Powers (the character, not the films) it's frozen in the '60s. The Ravi Shankar music, Alice walking around in a drug-addled like haze, the long straight hair parted in the middle, my sustained impression was that this was the ""flower power"" Alice and it just seemed incredibly dated. The croquet match sequence reminded me more than a little of the grape-stomping scene in Frankenheimer's ""Seconds"" (which came out the same year).

After watching it the second time with the director's commentary turned on, I can see that I wasn't too far off. It's amazing how close some of the hippie/flower child counterculture values of the '60s matched the Victorian satire of exactly 100 years earlier. I don't agree at all with Miller's choice for Alice. Listening to how he chose her seems like he had a creepily Dodgson-like infatuation with the actress. He put a casting notice in the local papers and received hundreds of photographs of young girls hoping to get the part. Apparently, after he saw Ann-Marie's photograph he never even called in a second candidate. Whatever he saw in her didn't translate to the screen, at least not for me. I know she was supposed to be a detached, dream-like observer, but to me she came across as almost catatonic. There was no interaction at all with any of the characters (you do interact in your dreams at times), and her delivery of lines was so deadly wooden that it was like a script girl doing the read-back for other actors to play off of.

I will give props to all of the famous actors who appeared for apparently a pittance. Their performances were, while understated, the best parts of the film...once you got used to the lack of costume. As others have said, you have to know the story going in to know what's going on.

About those bonus features. The reason I bought this is that, as a huge Tim Burton fan I had recently picked up his new ""Alice"" film (I missed it in the theaters). After watching it, I pulled out my musty VHS copy of ""Dreamchild"" for a viewing with my wife and daughter. I got this disc since it looked like an interesting counterpoint to that film, especially when I noticed that it had its own Dodgson/Alice Liddell docudrama included. As I watched it, I was astonished to find that most of the set pieces were IDENTICAL to the flashback scenes in ""Dreamchild."" Checking the credits, I was not surprised to find that Dennis Potter was the writer on both of them.  Also, as a silent film buff, the inclusion of the 1903 version was almost worth the price of the disc by itself! I'm sure that with the digital processing techniques available today that some of the horrible degradation of the nitrate print can be repaired. One can dream.",1276819200,6,3280,4.5508474576271185
1919181,4,B0000CG8I8,"This version of AIW movie was beautifully hallucinogenic and beautifully photographed in B&W, the music by Ravi Shankar was wonderful and there were some standout performances, especially Peter Cook's as the Mad Hatter. Overall, however, a kind of dry and emotionless atmosphere prevailed, oddly bleak against all the silliness and merriment of Carroll's words. This was brought to the fore by the incredibly detatched, emotionless performance of Anne-Marie Mallik as Alice. So it gets only 3 stars.

The play Alice (written by Dennis Potter & directed by Gareth Davies), on the dvd as an extra, gets 5 stars however and is well worth the price of the dvd. (The 1985 film Dreamchild is really a remake, somewhat re-imagined, of Alice.) It's presented as it was broadcast on BBC and it is brilliant. The play is full of emotion. The character of Dodgson/Carroll is brilliantly portrayed and his intentions regarding Alice are left to the viewer to sort out. He appeared to have a kind of childlike innocence about him (as befitting the creator of the fantastic book) yet some, particularly Alice's mother, were deeply suspicious of his motives.

  The musical score by Ravi Shankar is hypnotic and mesmerizing. Jonathan Miller's direction is daft and subtle and calls to mind the offbeat films of Richard Lester at that period.

About the product you actually get:
The 52 minute silent film is a good addition to your collection if you must have all things Alice.  It is well done, for a 1915 silent film, and manages to covey enough of the book to not disappoint.

The 2 10 minute cartoons have nothing to do with Alice In Wonderland.  They just happen to have a character named Alice.

Same with the 50 minute cartoon.  (Spoilers ahead) A girl named Alice happens to mention Alice in Wonderland, a mouse shrinks her and they go to Paris.  There are mouse stories and 2 Madeleine stories.  But no Alice in Wonderland.

The final item really is the 1972 Fiona Fulleton version of Alice.  Unfortunately the quality is terrible.  As though it was recorded from an analog TV signal to a VHS tape and then dubbed to a DVD.  If you liked that version, buy the solo DVD that Amazon sells.  I bought it at Amazon and it is a much better quality (and a good film).

1919190,3,B0000CG8I8,"...could easily have described this version when it first appeared in 1966 and it can still be used to describe it over 40 years later. There's no two ways about it, people either love or hate this adaptation by Jonathan Miller (read some of the other reviews) and it's easy to see why it generates this kind of reaction. The film is a TV movie in black and white, not light and shadow b&w but basic monochrome b&w like an early silent film. None of the actors wear any kind of traditional ALICE make-up or costumes although they wear Victorian clothes from Lewis Carroll's time. The character of Alice goes through the film in a dreamlike state rarely interacting with the others which renders it very impersonal for some and it is ""veddy,veddy British"" so much so that it was wasn't seen outside of England for many years. It is only now being given a wider release (it first appeared on DVD in 2003) to cash in on the new Tim Burton movie (just like other versions of ALICE hoping to make a buck or two).

As an unapologetic Anglophile and a child of the 1960s, I thoroughly enjoyed this ALICE. It has a dream cast of actors from Peter Cook to Michael Redgrave to Peter Sellers with horror fan fave Michael Gough thrown in for good measure and you haven't lived until you see Leo McKern (RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY) in drag playing the Duchess. The Indian soundtrack by Ravi Shankar helps to give it an otherworldly feel while rooting it firmly in the time in which it was made. Director Jonathan Miller gives an insightful commentary on what he was attempting to do which helps immensely after you have seen it but won't necessarily persuade you if really don't like the film. Not as bizarre as Jan Svankmajer's ALICE and miles away from the Disney animated version, it should appeal to Alice fans who are looking for something different or as an opportunity to see a once in a lifetime assembly of top British talent delivering Carroll's prose as only they can. The DVD also comes with Cecil Hepworth's 1903 version as an added bonus. Being a silent film specialist, that is why I bought the disk in the first place.",1267833600,12,2116,4.5248041775456915
1919191,5,B0000CG8I8,"WARNING for those who want to see Johnny Depp.  Of course, Tim Burton might love this version.  Might not be as twisted...
I only heard of this movie because Jonathan Miller was the director.  An actor/comedian (Beyond the Fringe) among many other things, he captures a psychological look at the ""children's story"".  This one gets the reputation of not being so child-like.
The actors listed are...Peter Cook, Peter Sellers, Alan Bennett, John Bird, John Gielgud, Michael Redgrave, Leo McKern, Wilfrid Brambell, Wilfrid Lawson, Wilfrid Lawson, Malcolm Muggeridge, and the unknown actor Anne Marie Mallik plays Alice.
Music by Ravi Shankar...
 According to the version from 2003, Dr. Miller said in the commentary that he revisited this story and tried to capture what he had felt when he first read the book.  Images of obscured characters which give one a tainted feeling remains throughout this movie.  Of course, that's my perspective.  Jonathan Miller would transition scenes very often in order to gain that feeling as if you as a person was walking through a dream.  You will experience this movie as if you just dreamt it up.  It's not supposed to make sense.  Don't bother to connect the dots . . .
There are no costumes to cover up famous actors' faces.  They are seen in complete view as it is strictly the acting that creates the characters from the book.  I feel this movie is the closest to the story than any other Wonderland movie. The only things in this version that are altered are the genius improv lines in which John Bird, Peter Cook, and Peter Sellers have said on the spot of filming.  The rest is true to the Victorian book.  This is a very artistic movie and many should watch to appreciate the mood that is set.

1919195,2,B0000CG8I8,"... I found this version of Alice almost unwatchable. Previous reviews well capture this version's character, including its truly fatal flaws. Please read them. But I think they are by-and-large far too charitable. I love Carroll's works, so do not take this negative review as a knock on the Alice books; it is purely about this dismal and moribund adaptation.

Note, I write ""adaptation."" This is not a faithful version of Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" nor was meant to be. Fair enough. But wherever there was any mirth or joy in Carroll's book (which is itself slightly dark), producer/director Miller has replaced it with a cringe-worthy combination of sleep-inducing sonambulism on Alice's part, and obscure and pretentious dated social commentary on the part of other characters. It simply doesn't work in America in 2007, and I doubt it worked even in England in 1966.

There *are* bright spots, to be sure, as others have mentioned: Sir Michael Redgrave's Caterpillar, Peter Cook's Hatter, and--for me the best and only not-depressing part of the film--Sir John Gielgud's Mock Turtle. But these cannot make up for what is otherwise a perhaps noble effort, but simply no fun.

As jammer wrote, ""The director never seems to get enough of having interminable full-face close-ups of [Alice], whose visage is devoid of expression or reaction and during which, little if anything else happens to advance the rest of the story. (Meanwhile all this precious screen time goes down the tubes when it could have been used so profitably elsewhere! Aarrgggghhhh!) Lewis Carroll, whose whole focus revolved around Alice, must surely have turned over in his grave.""

Just so, and, as Alice says, ""At any rate, I'll never go *there* again!""

(Note: my nearly three year old daughter is entirely in love with KCRW's radio/CD version of Alice [available for purchase only at kcrw.org, I think], and listens to it over and over. She is surely not the target audience of this disturbing version, but I thought she'd at least want to watch it *once*. She couldn't even make it through a single viewing.

1919196,3,B0000CG8I8,"This is an experimental TV-movie from the BBC's ""Wednesday Play"" anthology. That series was always willing to risk trying something different, and this ambitious, low-budget ""Alice"" is certainly different. I wouldn't say I ""enjoy"" this film exactly, but...

I appreciate it as an experiment in what television could do. I admire the cast of iconic Britons who wouldn't normally coincide in the same project: Peter Sellers, John Gielgud, Leo McKern (in drag as the Duchess), Michael Redgrave, Peter Cook, Wilfrid Brambell, Alan Bennett, Malcolm Muggeridge, etc.

I also admire the creativity it took to imagine this quintessentially British tale accompanied by Ravi Shankar music.

Some viewers may find the film too creepy and surreal, but the original book is pretty disturbing to begin with. The film is fairly incoherent, but then so is the book: It follows the scattershot, ever-shifting logic of a dream.

The biggest problem (aside from pacing that now seems too leisurely) is that Miller's production assumes you already know what's going on. For instance, it assumes you know that the two men dressed as... um... men are actually the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.

In other words, this is an ""Alice"" for people who are already overdosed on adaptations of ""Alice,"" and who might appreciate a weirdly different take on the familiar story.

1919197,4,B0000CG8I8,"Wolfgang Petersen's superb personal take on Homeric myth and legend is entitled Troy, which makes it perfectly plain that he is not setting out to reproduce the Iliad. Miller's Alice in Wonderland could, more honestly, have similarly been given a different title, since those expecting to see Carroll's masterpiece will inevitably be baffled. This is not the original work of genius, but a critical commentary: it is about the book, but not the book itself. As such, it is still pretty interesting, and provides an interpretation, or an introduction (for those like Disney and others, who totally fail to appreciate the book's perfection) to what it is all about. Carroll's inspired work is an account of a child's encounter with the nasty and irrational adult world. Beginning with a birth trauma, the child is ejected into this unpleasant place, via its passage through amniotic fluid. It gives itself the prize of the thimble of life.  Its staccato physical growth, both embryonic and post-birth, is accurately, if surrealistically, reflected --- the caterpillar is an ideal personification of metamorphosis --- as are its subsequent encounters with the enigmas of adult laws and regulations, the bullying, uglification and derision of mankind; the peremptoriness of authority, and its penchant for homiletic moralising.  The book also probes the meanings of time and space, but not as deeply as its sequel, Looking-Glass. The final conclusion, in Carroll's original, is that human society is merely the structure of a house of cards, as any mature intelligence will recognize, sooner or later. Miller's take represents some of this, but omits much, which is why it seems to fall short, and is only partially satisfying. Something is missing, but it's valuable nonetheless. Four stars, not five.

Oct 26. Just watched it again, listening to Jonathan's commentary. Interesting remarks. I still think he over-emphasized the dream aspect, and the loss of childhood theme. It was very subjective of him to introduce Wordsworth. Also, he does tend to use the first pronoun somewhat excessively: it's still his Wonderland, not Alice's. The beginning and ending of the book --- the bottomless fall down the rabbit-hole, and the collapse of the house of cards --- are still crucial to its interpretation; and omitting these scenes, which are very memorable, is wrong. Having humans play the parts without pretending to be animals is, however, dead right. The improvisations of the two Peters, and the Bird insertion, are also irritating, however. Agree that the girl is perfect: it doesn't matter at all that she is eleven, not seven. She played the part very well, in what must have been a rather daunting set-up for her. The story is disturbing, as Miller says, but it is not really as melancholy as he would like it to be.",1159920000,2,2820,5.112798264642082
1919198,5,B0000CG8I8,"This is the most complex movie rendering of Carroll's classic, and one of the stranger ones. It's a 1966 BBC production in black and white, and done on a shoestring budget. As a result, there's just about nothing in the way of special effects - and certainly no animal-shaped costumes for the dormouse, white rabbit, and all the others. Instead, the characters simply dress in a deliberately over-done Victorian style, probably put together by raiding the stock BBC costume closet.

But what characters! Peter Sellers (who played in other Alice movies as well) is the King of Hearts, Peter Cook is the Mad Hatter, Leo McKern is the Duchess(!), and that's just the start of this star-driven production. Ravi Shankar composed the music and performs much of it, giving an other-worldly sense that fits Carroll's dreamscape perfectly. It's a kind of dream continually on the edge of nightmare without ever quite crossing the line, the same feeling you get when watching ""The Prisoner"" TV series.

But Alice truly makes the story. Ann-Marie Mallik, in what may be her only acting role, was the perfect choice. She moves through the dream with all the reserve you'd expect of a browbeaten Victorian child, but with all the presence and a little insolence of a woman-child entering her teens. Although she's more observer than participant in most scenes, she conveys a quiet sense of being fully engaged in it all.

This isn't a disneyfied, silly production for children. Nor is it a surreal exaggeration like Jan Svankmajer's (which I also enjoyed). It's a serious and baffling work. In that sense, it's more true to Dodgson's original work than any other Alice I've seen. This one has my highest recommendation.

1919200,2,B0000CG8I8,"Is it possible to make a version of Lewis Carroll's classic Alice In Wonderland and turn it into an disaster so unbelievable that the sanitized Walt Disney version just seems totally magical and wonderful in contrast?

Yes, but it takes the BBC to do it.

Somehow, someway, in 1966 the BBC created, believe it or not, a Christmas special about Alice's world so devoid of joy and wonder that it is an amazing piece of work to watch. Alice, a 13-year old brunette Anne-Marie Mallik, is completely emotionless throughout the seventy-two minute production almost never making eye contact with the other characters and acting almost catatonic when she isn't acting irratible and bored.

Wonder is even stripped away from the other cast of characters. Except that the Cheshire Cat that is played by a real cat and voiced by Alice herself (which gives you the weird impression she is only talking to herself in some delusion), all the other characters are regular actors in Victorian dress, not the anthropomorphic animals that form the tropes of all the Alice adventures.

Yes, there are masterful performances by Peter Cook (The Mad Hatter), Sir John Gielgud (The Mock Turtle), and Peter Sellers (The King of Hearts) that are a delight to watch, especially Sir Michael Redgrave's delightful interpretation of the Caterpillar, but the too-few examples of great acting, the eerie Victorian sets, and Ravi Shankar's interesting soundtrack don't cover up the fact there is a total lack of understanding of Lewis Carroll's tribute to Alice Liddell.

The result then is a complete reinterprtation of Carroll's work into a black and white Victorian gothic where listlessness, boredom, and ennui reign. If that is your cup of tea, then by all means enjoy the production.",1113004800,7,1757,5.044827586206897
1919201,2,B0000CG8I8,"My brother and I have been searching for a black and white version of Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass that we saw on television as children in the 70's and was hoping this might be it.  Alas, it was not.

Instead, what I found was probably the most bizarre version of Alice in Wonderland that I have seen to date.  In fact, it starts out as downright creepy in the beginning.  And, quite honestly, if you had never read the book or seen other truer-to-the-book versions of Alice in Wonderland, you would have a difficult time understanding what is going on.  There are not really any fluid segways between the scenes.

Granted, while the scenery is quite enchanting at times, it can be difficult to feel like you are in Wonderland when none of the magical characters are in costume.  I know that the director did this so that you could see who the famous British actor was without he/she being covered up in elaborate make-up.  However, to me, using this direction method made it seem more like Alice had wandered onto the grounds of an insane asylum rather than into the fantastic world of Wonderland.  I mean, that whole scene with the Caucus Race -- what in the world was going on there?!

And maybe Alice was really in a mental institution, because most of the time, Alice appears as if she is on some type of medication as she just stares off in the distance with a blank look on her face not really focusing on anyone yet perfectly engaged in the conversation.

Overall, my recommendation is this: If you are a huge Alice in Wonderland fan and enjoy seeing different versions of the story put on film, then you will probably want to add this DVD to your collection.  Otherwise, skip it.",1108598400,11,1706,4.53921568627451
1919202,3,B0000CG8I8,"When I read about the particulars of this British TV special I was practically salivating.  Peter Sellers, Peter Cook, and music by Ravi Shankar at the height of 1966 pre-psychedelia?  How perfect does that sound?

Jonathan Miller has staged a very stylish production, but by accentuating eccentricities to suggest characters originally created by Carrol as fantasy, the effect is more nervous and uncomfortable than the dreamlike charm normally associated with the story.

Opinions vary, and this certainly is a most original and interesting take on the old chestnut.  Certainly worth a look by the adventurous viewer.",1105401600,6,619,5.40625

7999319,3,B0000CG8I8,"This version of Alice is often described as dark or surreal. I do not think that of it, but it was strange that they made no effort at all to dress up as the animal characters---they were all just portrayed as people. So it did seem as if Alice had been dropped into an insane asylum, rather than chasing the rabbit down the rabbit-hole to a magical place (in this case the rabbit-hole was actually a tunnel that changed into a corridor in an abandoned house, to a museum type setting where she came across the ""Dodo"". And in most scenes she is talking to herself asking questions (as in the book), but she answers all her own questions! I was annoyed that the main scene with the Cheshire Cat was left out, not to mention that it was just a regular cat/no grin!
But I really liked the extras on this DVD, which made up for what was lacking in the movie:  including the 1903 version (unfortunately commentary could not be turned off, but luckily I have on a different DVD without the commentary), the 1965 episode of Alice for the television series""The Wednesday Play"" which explored Dobson's obsession of Alice, and behind-the-scenes of the making of the soundtrack by  Ravi Shankar.",1452556800,,1184,4.553990610328638
7999320,5,B0000CG8I8,"If you lived through or like the 60s, you will like the feel of this Alice.

7999322,1,B0000CG8I8,"The BBC idiots who produced this piece of low-budget surrealistic, absurdist rubbish were probably the same bunch responsible for destroying things of real value, say, most of the recordings of Patrick Troughton's Doctor Who episodes.

Should serve as a warning against those who think a Ravi Shankar soundtrack and acid-tripping during production would provide good production values in making an adaptation of classic literature.

Update/comment: From Disney to Burton, every attempt to make a decent ""Alice"" cinematic adaptation with an actual dramatic arc changes the ""story"" (such that it is) way beyond Carroll's intent. But those directors and their screenwriters knew how to tell a story that moves and engages. The same could not be said of this Alice's director and his screenwriter--oops, turns out there was no screenwriter. Hoo boy, does it show!",1425513600,2,859,5.402985074626866
7999323,5,B0000CG8I8,"While this 1966 production by Jonathon Miller remains as controversial as it was when first aired, it still remains the only film I have viewed that follows Carroll's book even remotely close. While it is perhaps a little ""dark"" for children, it is worth the price.",1425254400,2,265,4.782608695652174
