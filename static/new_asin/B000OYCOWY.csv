8494849,5,B000OYCOWY,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: This was an outstanding ep in many ways (hilarious ambush; interesting hair session with the mullet and makeup segment with a dermatologist; both reveals). But what put it over the top was how grateful Laurie was. It's always nice to see someone who has given themselves to others for years take some time for themselves. And the hugs she had for S & C after they threw away her clothes(!), and then after she showed her final outfit to them, were heartwarming. Laurie was so funny; I LOL'd when she swore off her bad fashion habits, then realized she'd been holding up her left hand! This reminded me a lot of an ep from the later seasons with another Massachusetts gal, Leanne the witch, who similarly blossomed and was equally grateful. In fact, their voices even sounded a bit alike! Anyway, this was WNTW at its best in showing the transformative power of clothing.
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Nope. Yet if you do spring for this ep you will enjoy it. (By the way, Amazon, I found 20 eps on iTunes for $2 apiece, so while you still have me over a barrel, at least that's about $400 less of my money you'll be getting! Ha!)
