1930515,5,B0000DZC6J,I loved this movie and have been wishing more people saw it when it was on Sci Fi.  Really happy to see it on DVD.,1200355200,,114,3.56
1930516,1,B0000DZC6J,"Read and enjoyed all the books, can see why they have never made a sequel.",1425945600,,74,4.0
1930517,5,B0000DZC6J,"Good movie, have read all the books.",1424649600,,36,4.285714285714286
1930518,1,B0000DZC6J,"There are 120 books/audiobooks in the series so far. I have listened to all but a handful,  so you should get an idea as how much I am into and know this series.  That being said, this movie is t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e and no where close to the book. The people cast do not fit the characters, two very pertinent characters are missing (Doc and Mildred).  The written portrayal of the characters is completely wrong (one glaring example is that Jack never hit on Christy) and the acting is so/so at best.  The redoubts are no where close to accurate and references to the old tech is totally absent (forget any cool CGI showing a MAT_TRANS unit in operation).

I could go on and on but anyone that has even read or listened to even a few in the Deathlands series will clearly get the ""gist"" of what I am saying.
I breezed through and if there was a ""0"" below the first star, that's what I would have clicked on.  Save your time, i'm throwing away my copy because I don't think I can bare watching the whole thing.  I may rip an eye out in frustration.",1421712000,,1042,4.285714285714286
1930519,3,B0000DZC6J,"I've read the Deathlands books from 1 all the way to 83.  I really enjoyed the written version of Deathlands.  The movie could have been so much better.  The story line was fair as it did deviate from the book version somewhat, but the cinematography was really cheap.  I think that the Sci-Fi original production team could have done a better job than these guys.  At times, it seemed like a group of high school kids with their dad's video camera.",1408233600,,449,4.493827160493828
1930520,5,B0000DZC6J,great books the movie is some what close,1405555200,,40,4.125
1930521,2,B0000DZC6J,"The positive point is that it's a Deathlands movie.

After that, it's a pretty poorly done LOW BUDGET take on ""Homeward Bound"" (I think it was the fifth book in the series).  At that, I could take it if it weren't for so many dumb shortcuts.

For instance, Ryan spends time shooting an M-16 with no magazine in it.  Folks are dressed in homespun -- but Jak manages to wear brand-new football jerseys.  He's no longer a knife expert, but is a mutant instead.  His mutant power is ""mutie rage"" -- which basically means he yells ""Hah"" at people after he kills them.  Kristie begs the bad guy not to hurt her -- the real Kristie would have just kicked his butt (which she eventually does ... but she whimpered and begged first).  Kristie picks off a sniper 100 yards away with her snub-nose.  Way too unbelievable.

I got the feeling they spent about 30 minutes writing a script -- and then gave up about half-way through and just winged the rest.

OTOH -- it's the only Deathlands movie, so ...

The casting actually isn't that bad -- if you forgive Jak's changes.  J.B. looks a lot like the picture in the first book.",1403740800,,1115,4.4068627450980395
1930522,3,B0000DZC6J,"After buying and listening to 60 audio book from the series, some of the characters just didn't met up to expectations. The story tried to follow the book, but varied in many places.  I would support more Deathlands movies just because I believe this series by James Axler is awesome.",1398124800,,284,4.68
1930523,5,B0000DZC6J,"While not perfect, I'd have to say this is most definitely one of SciFi's better efforts in general!  And not to be missed if you are a fan of the Deathland's novels by James Axler!  This flick captures the spirit of Axler's novels -even if it does go a little easy on action and violence.  I love that it tells the origin of Ryan Cawdor and sets up his further adventures in the Deathlands.  The movie is pretty much true to the novels and lends a substantial bit of sexiness to the series we don't get in the books.  I didn't like it back on 2003 when it first ran on cable but coming back to this ten years later it sparked my interest in the books once more and even made me curious about the Outlanders series.  Highly recommended for fans of the series -new or old.  You won't regret settling in to watch this one.  I just wish Amazon would make it available on Instant Video again!!",1378598400,,889,4.218934911242603
1930524,3,B0000DZC6J,"I love the Deathlands series and have almost every book. I had read reviews on this movie and decided to purchase it anyway even though the reviews weren't very favourable. Being a Deathland fan, it was neat seeing the characters brought to life, although I thought the actor who played J.B was a little portly than J.B seemed to be in the books. Doc wasn't in the movie either, although I did know this before I bought the movie, I do wish he had been included because he is my favourite character in the series. I wish Ryan's hair had been curlier and Jak had been more feral as he was in the books.
  If you can forget that this is based on a book series one would probably enjoy it more because the story wasn't bad. The budget was low, of course, because this was made for the sci-fi channel so the effects weren't the best. I think the acting over all was great though, especially the villians. I would recommend this movie even to a Deathlands fan because it is the ""Deathlands"".",1362182400,2,986,4.353260869565218
1930525,5,B0000DZC6J,This was a great b movie. I am trying to collect all the books and movies of this series. Good stuff.,1361664000,,101,3.857142857142857
1930526,4,B0000DZC6J,This movie is based on a very good book series that I am reading and it was close but missed on a few things. I still enjoyed it and wish they would do more feature films.,1361577600,,171,3.7777777777777777
1930527,1,B0000DZC6J,"EVEN if you are a big fan of the series.

IF you take a flyer on it, as I did as a Vincent Spano and Traci Lords fan, this will be one of your regrets as you take your last breath.

Still, if you like Spano or Traci Lords, it is interesting to see them.  Spano spends most of the movie in a full length brown leather coat that had more of a pimp dressing gown look than anything approaching Keanu Reeve's. Traci Lords WAS scary but then I think we always knew that. Jeny Lano was at least eye candy in a yoga tube halter, but that was all the skin you ever imagined in this could-have-been.

Best to wait for a solid REDO. Rated ONE so YOU don't waste your $1 plus shipping.",1306627200,,674,3.9703703703703703
1930528,3,B0000DZC6J,I've read this book and many more in the series. I don't know why others in the series have not been made into movies. This movie followed the book somewhat but lacked the fire of the book. The movie was slow and rather bland. If you have a choice buy the book and not the movie.,1260835200,3,279,4.0
1930529,3,B0000DZC6J,"I was a Deathlands fan for years, that is until Axler died and the series was taken over by a mostly inept series of ghost writers so it was with interest that I watched this movie when it first aired on Scifi.  Better then the usual Scifi channel offering with some very impressive camera work and if the story isn't ""good"" in the traditional sense at least I was entertained.  There are certain drawbacks the biggest for me was no Doc Tanner but the characters that survived the adaptation process were executed faithfully enough.

Is the movie going to win any awards?  Dear god no but those of you decrying this movie as a horrible adaptation and a fraud should remember that in spite of its many problems at least it got produced.",1246320000,3,735,4.503759398496241
1930530,1,B0000DZC6J,I am a big Deathlands fan. I was excited to see a Deathlands movie till I saw the movie. the actors did ok at best. should have had different actors for most of the parts. Spano did not fit for Ryan Cawdor. JB Dix was totally different than as the books describe. Jak Lauren was farthest off of all. Doc Tanner and Lauri Quint were totally omited. the movie drags out too long for a low budget flick. I would like to see a real Hollywood production of this or any of the Deathlands books.,1237680000,2,488,4.147368421052631
1930531,1,B0000DZC6J,"This movie (and I use that term lightly) is a great waste of time. I watched it in totality and that's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I have read the entire Deathland series - twice. This dreck has nothing in common w/ that James Axler series of the same name. The red filter made the outside shots unwatchable, and the poor acting made the rest of the scenes unwatchable. The script bore no resemblence to any of the books and the action was akin to all the clowns getting out of a car at the circus. God this thing was terrible. If you get this DVD somehow (and I hope you haven't bought it) it's only good to hang from your rearview mirror to keep off the radar. Please, please don't buy this crap. Spend the money on the book of the same name and read it - you will be much better for doing it. Don't waste your time on this DVD.",1227139200,,845,4.065868263473054
1930532,1,B0000DZC6J,"This is the bottom of the barrel for ""B"" movies. It doesn't come close
to the acutal book by Axler. Whoever wrote the screenplay should find
another occupation. None of the actors come close to representing what
the lead characters actually look like or act like their respective
characters in Axler's Deathland series.",1215129600,2,319,5.037735849056604
1930533,2,B0000DZC6J,"Being a huge Deathlands reader mark, I was extremely excited to finally see a Deathlands movie come out.

But alas, it failed miserably on so many areas.

Actually the actors who portrayed Ryan Cawdor and Krysty Wroth were good, and actually dressed and looked the part. The other ones who played Jak Lauren and J.B. Dix were terrible.

Even with a low budget, this easily could have been a classic B-movie post-holocaust action/adventure movie. It actually showed promise at times, but failed miserably at its very core. Too bad. This long running action series could still be made into a hot Hollywood production hit if it were made right. And it actually would not cost that much to produce.

But if you are not a harcore fan like myself, you might see it in a different light. As I can tell from some of the positive reviews here.",1208390400,10,834,4.614864864864865
1930534,2,B0000DZC6J,"DeathLands  HomeWard Bound movie is a fair movie but it left out to main people it left out Doc Tanner, and Lori Quinn  they played a big part in the book but they where not in the movie and  Krysty Wroth was good in the movie but her red hair was not seen doing anything in the movie when there is danger or not . And  Jak Lauren was good in the movie but he wore a football jersey and had short curly while hair in the book he had long white hair and he had his jacket with throwing knifes that was not in the movie  Ryan and JB were about the same as in the movie and book everbout else was the same in the movie like they where in the book  so the movie was good butthey should had Doc Tanner and Lori quinn",1202947200,,711,3.802721088435374
1930535,4,B0000DZC6J,"If you are a fan of the Deathlands SciFi/Adventure novels penned by James Axler, then you are going to be reluctantly satisfied with this film.  It is very low budget, but I am thankful that the powers that be even attempted to make a film adaptation of the Deathlands series.  Yeah, it has lots of room for improvement, but at least it was made. Vincent Spanno did a great job as Ryan, and the rest of the cast was well received.  The cinematography has a lot to be desired, and the lighting in particular throughout the film was poor.  The red filter used for the outdoor shots was extremely annoying. Yes I know they were trying to visually convey the radioactive skyline, but it really took my attention away from the story.  The script was well done, and the acting above par.  As a 20 year +/- fan of the Deathlands series, I give it a 4 outta 5 star rating.  Thanks SciFi for finally releasing this on DVD for the fans!  SciFi Channel rocks!",1201824000,7,948,4.377142857142857
8001640,3,B0000DZC6J,Great movie just wished the producers and director would have read or listened to the audiobook James Axlers Deathlands 5: Homeward Bound then this movie would have probably done better at the box office and made a lot more money. But it is a good film to watch if you are into the Deathlands series.,1519948800,,300,4.472727272727273
