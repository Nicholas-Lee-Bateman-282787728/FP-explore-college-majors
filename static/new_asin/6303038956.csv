7835097,3,6303038956,"Okay, according to my research ""Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet"" is a Roger Corman production that uses footage from a 1962 Soviet science fiction film produced by the Leningrad Studio of Popular Science Fiction films and entitled ""Planeta Bur"" (variously translated as ""Planet of Storms"" and ""Storm Planet,"" but more accurately titled at one point ""Cosmonauts on Venus"").  This Soviet film was apparently strong on production design, but weak on the plot: Cosmonauts and their robot, that plays dance music, land on Venus looking for intelligent life but only find dinosaurs, killer plants, and, of course, a volcanic eruption.  As the crew departs an intelligent Venusian watches they leave.  Anyhow, much of the footage from the Venus sequences was used in ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" in 1965, intercut with new material from writer/director John Sebastian (a pseudonym of Curtis Harrington), which does not really constitute a remake of the Soviet film, but which is certainly in the ballpark.  Some of the ""Planeta Bur"" footage was used in another Corman production, ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" (1966, a.k.a. ""Gill Woman), which was Peter Bogdanovich's directorial debut courtsey of the Roger Corman apprenticeship program.
""Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet"" stars Basil Rathbone as Professor Hartman, who is in charge of Earth's expedition of three ships to Venus, even though he is back on a Moon Base.  One of the ships is taken out by a meteor while another crashes on Venus, leaving the third to rescue it (good thing they sent three ships, huh?).  There is one beautiful women in the crew, played by Faith Domergue, but she does not get to go down on the planet.  That is because the footage of the astronauts is really of the cosmonauts from the Soviet film, and they did not have a woman in their crew.  Got it?  Anyhow, two of men from the rocket in orbit, along with their robot, go down to the surface to rescue the crew from the rocket that crashed.  There they encounter, well, dinosaurs, killer planets, and, of course, a volcanic eruption.  Meanwhile, the big question down on Venus is whether the planet is inhabited by beautiful women.  This question might be more than wishful thinking, because some of the boys think they hearing a woman's voice singing.
I have to admit that all things considered I would be more interested in seeing ""Planeta Bur,"" even without subtitles, than ""Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet"" (I have a question about that title: do you have to have ""humans"" to have history?  Because these ""dinosaurs"" are probably a lot smarter than these humans so maybe they have some sort of oral history going at this point).  There are just too many unintentional laughs in this film to ever take it seriously and the cutting back and forth between the old and the new is no where as smooth as it is in, say, the original ""Godzilla"" with Raymond Burr.  Of course, there is something to be said for a ""remake"" that includes so much footage from the original.  But I will stop now.  This is a party movie, not something for the serious connoisseur.",1038614400,,3099,4.850094876660341
7835098,1,6303038956,"Dreadful patched-together thing, assembled from a Russian movie which was cut up to include el-cheapo Roger Corman style sequences featuring Faith Domergue (who appears almost comatose) and Basil Rathbone (who leans on things a lot).  The rest of the cast is Russian, and the rest of the movie is dubbed, very clumsily indeed.  The film has an overall reddish tinge (outer space is inexplicably fire engine red) and the DVD was mastered from a really terrible film copy.  The plot points are horribly obvious, the special effects are garbagey, and the film moves at a glacially slow pace.  I can only imagine what it was like before Corman cut it to its current length!
That being said, the robot IS cool, as is the air-car.  The vision of Venus is hilarious, especially considering what we know now, and the idea of calling the robot ""Robot John"" and addressing him as if he were a particularly stupid child is peculiar to say the least.
Overall this is pretty dang awful.  I like bad movies but...this might just be irredeemable.  If the MST 3K crew were still working, this would be perfect fodder for them, and with a sufficient amount of beer and three witty friends, you might be able to have a fun evening.  But there are much better bad movies out there than this one to make fun of.",1009756800,,1291,4.606986899563319
7835099,4,6303038956,"PRE-HISTORIC PLANET is one of three AIP films that contain stolen fottage from Russian soviet epic, PLANET OF STORMS. I think that the footage was ""discovered"" by Roger Corman who was wroking for AIP around this  time. The film is an incredibly slow made-for-TV movie but once it gets  going it's a bent, giddy and  unintentionally hilarious romp with lots of  weird looking sets and hilarious looking dinosaurs. If you enjoyed this  classic, take a look at the even-better PLANET OF BLOOD (AKA: QUEEN OF  BLOOD).",944697600,,513,4.906976744186046
