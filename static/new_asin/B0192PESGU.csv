7561181,5,B0192PESGU,"For Better or for Worse stars and co-stars respectively, Lisa Whelchel and Kim Fields from a favorite family show of mine from the past, The Facts of Life.  It was a real blast to see these two women together once again but in completely different roles.  The movie also star Antonio Cupo, who is another favorite of mine from a couple of other Hallmark movies (Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade and I Do, I Do, I Do""  a really funny movie that I enjoy watching over and over again  inside pun once you have seen the movie.)

In this movie, Wendy (Ms. Whelchel) is a wedding planning coordinator who is just beginning to emerge from the grief of losing her husband, when charming, but a bit of a pain, divorce attorney Marco (Mr. Cupo) moves his business in next door to Wendy's wedding chapel.  Rosanne (Ms. Fields) is Wendy's employee and good friend who offers her advice as the two business go head to head.  A good feud is emerging when Wendy's son and Marco's daughter meet, fall in love, and become engaged.  Suddenly, Wendy and Marco are thrown together to help plan the wedding. As they get to know each other better, sparks of irritation and attraction get thrown left and right.

Both Ms. Whelchel and Ms. Fields look as beautiful today as they did decades ago.  Somehow, they seem to have found the fountain of youth in the intervening years.  They are as fresh and funny today as they were years ago.  Mr. Cupo is both easy on the eyes and a tickle to the funny bone.  He brings a special charm to the more than slightly irritating character and helps make this romantic comedy more believable than most.  I am always pleased to see a movie in which he stars.

Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies and Mysteries channel are my family go-to television stations.  Their movies have always been good family fare and, recently, the caliber of the plots, characters, and actors has increased dramatically.  So much so, we are enjoying these movies much more than those that are being released by other studios theatrically.",1453161600,12,2033,4.618384401114207

7561214,2,B0192PESGU,"Poor acting.  I was hoping for a cute predictable, yet funny story, but I was too distracted by the poor acting.  And when are the kids more together than the parents?? It was poorly done in many ways.",1509753600,,201,4.2631578947368425

7561253,3,B0192PESGU,"It's a made for TV movie, so have low expectations. It was fun to watch as a family and laugh at the character foibles, the predictable plot, and the utter lack of character development. There were a few fun, quirky things, such as the lead male's affinity for speaking Italian, and one of the love interest's lactose intolerance. It looked like everyone involved was having fun, which made it at least tolerable to watch.",1484352000,3,422,4.716216216216216

7561258,5,B0192PESGU,"it is a pleasure to see Lisa Whelchel back on TV and in such a funny, warm family film.  And for good measure, Kim Fields, her 'Facts Of Life' costar is her costar in this film too.

Lisa plays a widowed, wedding planner with a 22 year old son.  The son gets engaged to the daughter of Lisa's character's arch enemy, a divorce attorney that recently moved in next to her business.  Besides coming across as very warm and likable, Lisa looks amazing.  She is a beautiful adult Blair Warner!

Kim plays her employee/friend/comic side kick and she displays great comic timing and facial expressions.

Antonio Cupo plays the neighboring lawyer and of course the enemy's become romantic.

This is a feel good film that you should watch.",1480982400,7,731,4.65625
