3661054,2,B001JXPC6O,"I chose this film for the presence of the brillaint Helen Mirren, whose performances I have enjoyed so much in the past.  Ironically, it is just her performance here that has been the reason I couldn't stomach this film.

I watched it one evening, with great expectations and was terribly turned off by the character, ""Maggie"" short for ""Magdalene,"" a  Mary Magdalene wannebe, complete with very long red hair and loose morals.  We first see her lounging about, sometimes in bed with a fellow who looks less than half her age, smoking grass, smoking whatever, drinking a lot, sashaying about in her snakeskinned cowboy boots and hippie clothes, acting oh so cool.  The character would be charming if she were under 30, but at 60 or whatever, Helen Mirren with her ample hips and many, many wrinkles, just doesn't pull it off.  She's supposed to be  very endearing, in contrast to her uptight art historian proper sister and brother-in-law, regular folks who work and bathe.

After a while I couldn't bear it and turned it off. However, lured by the blurbs on the DVD cover, I thought I must be missing something and tried again.  More Mirren as Magdalene, the latter day degenerate-regenerate,ex-druggie, jazz loving, bad girl with a heart of gold....just made me slam the disk back in its case with a resolve never to try again.

Maybe it gets better but I just couldn't get past this charicature.  The site of Mirren, at 60 acting like 20, with make up caked on her wrinkled flesh, acting oh so superior to all the straight folks around her, was too depressing. This is the kind of film that would have been popular in 1968, and maybe if Mirren had starred in it then, she could have been smashing.  Now....not so much.

Maybe the story gets better.  I checked out at the time of the ""makeover"" into the high society type who will bid at the art auction.  That promised for too much cuteness for me....",1261699200,4,1904,4.641791044776119
3661055,5,B001JXPC6O,"Helen Mirren's arguably one of the best actresses today. Who else could make Britain's Queen come to life on the screen with dignity and grace?

In Masterpiece Theatre's ""Painted Lady,"" she plays Maggie Sheridan, an aging rock star who's taken shelter in the guest house of a family friend and father figure. When he's murdered over a painting, she goes undercover to solve the crime.

This is an intricate mystery that takes some deliciously unpredictable turns before the story comes to its conclusion. Definitely not a film you will want to see uninterrupted, you do not want to miss a thread or you will be lost.

Warning -- this is not family fare. You have nudity, gore, and some torture depicted in this film. ""Painted Lady"" is definitely an art treasure on its own, well worth watching and owning.

3661056,3,B001JXPC6O,"Heln Murrin's ""Painted Lady"" is a diffent type of Helen Murrin movie.  I would call it her ""first detective"" experience.

3661058,4,B001JXPC6O,"What starts off as being your average Masterpiece Thetre gig turns out to be something to savour rather than castoff.

Very reminiscent of the Long Good Friday which coincidentally stars Helen Mirren, this mini-series has judicious elements which combine to form a coherent whole which Mirren Makes all of her own.

The series itself is compelling viewing, intertwining various, shall we say, less than great aspects, and transforming it into an elegant mystery that could have served as a vehicle for the redoubtable Inspector Morse.

Some parts are frankly incredulous, such as the character of an ex-rock star metamorphosising into a titled Eurpoean art thief, but they enhance the mystery rather than detract from it.

Overall, it is a good use of 3 to 4 hours which leaves a feeling of satisfaction from it's consumption rather than a bitter aftertaste, and which leaves one with a lasting impression of why Helen Mirren can be a great actress.",1242864000,5,949,5.025477707006369
3661059,5,B001JXPC6O,"""Painted Lady,"" is a British mystery/crime thriller/drama, made as a television mini-series by Granada for the United Kingdom's associated independent television stations (ITV).  It was shown here on the Public Broadcasting System's ""Masterpiece Theatre"" in 1998 and 2000.  It stars Oscar, Emmy-winning, and highly-admired actress Helen Mirren (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-Complete-Collection-10-Disc-Set/dp/B001MLBTBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect - Complete Collection (10 Disc Set) </a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B00005JPAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>), in a part that might have been written for her, and probably was, by the talented Allen Cubitt(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-2/dp/B0000X2ET2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect 2</a>).  It was helmed by the equally-talented Julian Jarrold (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brideshead-Revisited/dp/B00005JLG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brideshead Revisited</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Jane/dp/B000ZIZ0RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Jane</a>). And Mirren herself, who undoubtedly had quite a lot to do with this production, takes an Associate Producer credit on it; as does Rebecca Eaton, of Boston Station WGBH, ""Masterpiece Theatre's""long-time Executive Producer.  It's a two-part series that runs approximately 198 minutes, and, wonderfully enough, it's got subtitles, too.

Mirren gives every sign of having a ball playing Maggie Sheridan, former 1960's British blues crooner, now semi-retired, living in the lushest green Irish countryside, with wine glass in one hand, cigarette in the other, and boy toy not far.  She's got a ""diamond"" or whatever stud in her nose, and is at ease in her old hippie gear.  Until, that is, a robbery goes very wrong,leaving her friend and benefactor Sir Charles Stafford (Ian Cuthbertson,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gorillas-in-the-Mist/dp/0783233523/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gorillas in the Mist</a>) dead, one of his most valuable paintings stolen.  Maggie wants to find her friend's masterpiece, and his  killer, so she insinuates herself into the art trade.  She poses as a wealthy Polish countess, and she's off to glamorous auctions, hotels, restaurants, and such, in London and New York.  Gone is the hippie gear, in favor of smart suits and signature jewelry.  Suspense mounts, particularly after Maggie hooks up again with her close friend, Sir Charles's deeply troubled son Sebastian (Iain Glen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Bede/dp/B000M2E31S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam Bede</a>).  Other strong supporting turns are contributed by Lesley Manville (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Or-Nothing/dp/B00007KK3X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Or Nothing</a>) as her sister Susie Peel; Michael Maloney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Truly-Madly-Deeply/dp/B00005R5GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Truly Madly Deeply</a>) as her brother-in-law Oliver Peel; Franco Nero (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Camelot/dp/6304712944/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Camelot</a>)as Robert Tassi,an important Italian-American New York art dealer, and John Kavanagh (The Tudors - The Complete First Season), as Michael Longley, an Irish gangland chief. The mystery centers on a real painting by the real 17th century Italian Artemisia Gentileschi, the first woman to make a name for herself in the heavily male-dominated art field, and a true feminist hero.

It so happens that once I met friends for a drink in the bar of New York's Algonquin Hotel, a theater district landmark made legendary for the wit of its ""Round Table,"" of carousing writers and performers, Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, the Marx Brothers and company; and there was Mirren, enjoying a drink or three, and chatting amiably with her neighbors.  She appeared to have been enjoying painting the town red; even as she appears to be enjoying painting a couple of towns red in ""Painted Lady."" I enjoyed watching her, and expect you will, too.",1234483200,24,4406,7.544747081712062
3661060,4,B001JXPC6O,"""Painted Lady"" is 100% unpredictable. This one is impossible to get to the root of (solve) the mystery till the very end, so don't cheat yourself and skip immediately to the last scene selection. The facts behind who-dun-it and the ever changing mystery of why, are what makes this movie. That is why the Chicago Tribune labeled it ""Deliciously Complex."" That it is. For 190 minutes of its 198 minute length, you'll constantly wonder who or why.

Helen Mirren, is wonderful, in and out of her clothing. Her character, ex-singer Maggie Sheridan, seems to make friends with many, but it is the murder of Sir Charles, whom Maggie considered ""like a father"", that sets her on the hunt for the killer.  And a search for a lost painting. The mystery becomes a tapestry of clues related to drugs, homosexual activity, murder, art trade (legal and illegal), and robbery. Maggie uses anyone and everyone in her quest. All she seems to find are more questions. She uses anyone, legal or illegal, man or woman, crook or cop, enemies and family, in her search for answers.  She uses her own created alias of an art-loving rich countess. Her sister helps her learn a bit of art history, but just enough to get herself into many fixes.

The movie does get a little graphic in places, so it's not for the squeamish or the kiddies. Nothing like an attackers brains being blown across her pretty face to wake up Maggie to more danger. In Maggie's effort to help Sir Charles' son with his financial woes, he gets strung up clad only in his briefs, then used for crossbow target practice.  Well, get the picture?  This British mystery, unrated, is NOT G.  The cover includes a splat and run of blood in the upper right corner--there's a reason for that.

Extras include subtitles although even though most of the activity takes place in England, it is easy to understand, not strong accent. Helen Mirren also has a written bio to read and a huge list of credits to her career.

Painted Lady is more than just a robbery gone bad ending in a murder. It is about the mysterious discoveries of a half dozen or more characters involved with the mishap. Each new discovery leads to who? what? when? where? and why?

Well, I tried to leave you a warning for those needing it related to nudity, blood, and sexual situations. But, also I'd encourage mystery fans. Bet you won't solve it any faster than Maggie did.",1234310400,41,2386,4.619385342789598

It's just one scene that mirrors the works of art at the center of the plot. Like so many Masterpiece Theater productions, this one is rich in writing, performances, settings, cinematography, wardrobe -- everything. The plot is also many-layered, though sometimes a bit hard to follow. Mirren's portrayal of Maggie Sheridan is flawless: the beyond-her-prime singer, the former abuser of substances and product of failed relationships, the actress within the performer who can take on a whole other personna she didn't know was in her, the 'woman of a certain age' with all that connotes. Americans had just gotten to really know her on Prime Suspect when this whole great reach of other characterization was broadcast. It's lovely on many levels, even in the ugliness of some of the plot twists. But Maggie Sheridan becomes as real a person to us as someone we've known in our own mid-life, and she's worth the knowing after all.",1379548800,2,1103,4.967567567567568

This is an intense British mystery that should delight fans of this genre, as well of fans of Helen Mirren. I don't need to say what it is about, as so many other viewers have done that. This is a film that you have to pay attention to while watching: No multi-tasking allowed, or you won't enjoy or be able to follow it. Ms. Mirren is believable in her role as a washed up rock star and the protaganist that dives into the art world to find the killer of an old friend and father figure.
Overall, I enjoyed this film. It was interesting and moved fairly quickly throughout. There are bits of humor, sadness and violence, but they all have their place in it.

3661131,4,B001JXPC6O,"Thsi film is originally made for Masterpiece Theatre and apparently screenwriters had Helen Mirren in mind when they wrote the role for the main character Maggie Sheridan. Maggie is care free spirit and musician who lives quiet life on the country estate belonging to her friend.  She creates music, has young lover and lives reclusive, quiet life.  Until one day, her friend is found dead during roberry on his estate where thiefs stole some of the artwork from a private collection.

Before long, Maggie and her murdered friend's son Sebastian, find themselves searching for the culprits that leads them to London and NYC and the lives of art collectors and their dealers who will resort to all means possible to get the art they want.  For this crowd, money is not concern.  Everyone has it (money), the question is only which person has more desire to acquire the object or a piece of art they are interested in.

Helen Mirren has uncanny way of playing very strong women.  Kind of women who can roll with the punches and still land on their feet, no matter how brused they get along the way.  It is no wonder that not so long ago, this great actress, in her 60s now was voted the sexiest actress in the world.  There is just spark about her and touch of mystery that makes her irresistable to the audiences.

It is a two part film that takes time to watch and definitely requires undivided attention.  I enjoyed it and I recommend it to audience who love fine scripts, good mystery and great team of british actors.  Italian actor Franco Nero makes guest appearance and he is as charismatic and irresistible as Helen is.  These two actors do make a good pair on screen!",1356566400,,1674,4.595959595959596
3661132,1,B001JXPC6O,"This is a frustratingly dumb, contrived and tedious movie masquerading as an intellectual thriller.  Helen Mirren is a crime-solving former drug addict and blues singer who pretends to be an Eastern European countess and art connoisseur in order to avenge the death of her best friend's father.  It's not clear why she steals a weapon which is NOT the murder weapon and doesn't just tell the police what she knows.  Instead she goes on a ""Pretty Woman""-style shopping spree (complete with Nicole Farhi product placement), and runs around spouting a very suspect Russian accent and bidding on things at auctions. The whole film feels like a vanity project for Ms. Mirren.  Every male character encountering her must ogle her like mad and/or have sex with her.  Even the background research for this film is shoddy.  One character corrects another, saying an image is not of Diana, but of Artemis.  Diana was the Roman name for Artemis, for crying out loud, and the ""art expert"" is talking about a 16th century Italian painting.  If you're going to make an inane, pretentious movie about hijinks in the art world, at least get the art history part right.  The preposterous plot ends as nonsensically as it carried on.  The only good thing is a chance to see Franco Nero, who played Lancelot in the 1967 musical ""Camelot"".  He's possibly even more handsome now, but still not old enough to have been 20 in 1947 as the story requires.  What a mess.",1325721600,21,1444,4.778225806451613

In this film Mirren is an ex-rock star who ""plunges"" into the crime underworld to track down the killers of her benefactor. How are we supposed to believe this story line when at a crucial juncture Mirren's character almost misses a critical appointment due to oversleeping a one-night stand with a musician friend she runs into one evening.

3661135,5,B001JXPC6O,"This tale was specifically crafted for Helen Mirren. It's quite off the beaten path of Prime Suspect. I have watched this several times & every time, I find something I missed previously. It takes your complete attention & a working mind to follow its many twists & turns. Yet like any maze, you are well rewarded upon completion. You cannot sit back, relax and expect it to just fall into your lap. And if you are really paying attention, the entire tale is told in the first 20 minutes.

As you've no doubt read, it involves a once famous but now greatly faded folk-rock singer who is literally saved from a drug addled death by friend, Sebastian (Iain Glen). She now lives on his father's estate(Ian Cuthbertson) & on his largess. When he is murdered in an art theft gone awry, Maggie (Mirren) makes it her duty to find the killer.  She's sure that if she can find the stolen painting, it will lead her straight to the killer.

Sebastian returns home for the funeral with huge troubles of his own. He's accumulated a large dept with a notorious drug lord. But 1st things 1st. His father's death brings its own disconcerting issues. He had an important & valuable art collection no one even knew existed. How it came into his possession is an even bigger mystery.

 Maggie escapes Ireland for London by posing as her real self, a Polish countess. She figures the killer will eventually have to sell the painting & she'll catch him when he does. Enter her much younger half sister Susie Peel (Lesley Manville) an art historian & her art agent husband Oliver (Michael Maloney). They are incredulous that she would even try to do what has taken them years to learn; how to become a respected art buyer. Yet Susie is intrigued by the picture of the painting that was stolen. She believes rather than a copy, it is an original work by the female artist Artemisia Gentileschi. Maggie's complete transformation into the countess is their 1st clue that she's really serious about this. To their surprise she proves a very quick study. But, where to start? Ah, an art auction in NYC where she will inauspiciously make her presence known by buying two important paintings. One for a client of Oliver's and one for him that he believes just may be the touched up lost van Dyke portrait of the ""Countess of Sussex."" (Interestingly, everything said in reference to the art & artists is true. That painting really is missing.)

Meanwhile Sebastian, while going through his father's papers & old 8mm movies, makes some startling discoveries of his own. One's that help him better understand the father he never felt connected to in life, he now sadly finds in his death. It leads him on a mission of his own.

All these diverse stories seem to be completely unrelated. But as you wind your way through, you realize they all converge. You are following the branches  that all lead to but one vine. This intriguing juxtaposition & entwining keeps you guessing up until the very last frame.

The art work frames the story and in places actually tells it. Watch for humorous interposing of the actors posing as famous paintings. Blink and you'll miss them. This is a thought provoking journey, well worth taking.",1302048000,3,3195,4.680926916221034

What's not to like?
Alas, the whole movie. Preposterous is too kind. Every plot development is either signaled way way ahead --- or so absurd it is a nonsequitur. Heavy-handed, slow, tortuous ( yes, there's torture in the movie, but the plot has also been tortured).

3661137,2,B001JXPC6O,"I'm usually a big Helen Mirren fan, and I love British mysteries, but geez Louise if this isn't one of the least believable, most convoluted things I've ever seen.  Mirren plays Maggie Sheridan a formerly successful blues singer, who goes undercover as a Polish countess art expert to investigate the death of her mentor/father figure. One minute she's got a nose ring and is sleeping with a scraggly rock star wannabe, the next she is flirting with Italian millionaires and bidding on Goyas. The ease with which you believe such a transition could occur is likely to highly influence your viewing experience. The pace is leisurely, the plot meandering, the payoff underwhelming. Watch Prime Suspect instead if you want to see Mirren in a mystery.",1284854400,4,747,4.976

8313917,3,B001JXPC6O,"I just got done watching the first half of this 3 hour Masterpiece Mystery mini-mini-series from 1997. While Mirren and the other actors were all quite excellent (I especially liked Mirren's movie half-sister and her sister's husband), I was totally caught off guard when the movie veered into consenting adult antics with dangerous outcomes. For me, this changed the movie from something fun and entertaining to something a bit smutty and distasteful. I am not sure I am going to watch the rest of the movie. I am probably a bit old-fashioned in that I feel certain things between consenting adults are best kept behind closed doors and I was quite annoyed that there was no indication on the DVD box that the movie had ""adult"" content in it. I am primarily posting this review to let others know that the movie does contain this kind of material so potential viewers will know ahead of time what they are getting into. On the other hand, if that is no problem, then you will probably enjoy the movie as it does get very suspenseful and the acting is very good.",1496275200,2,1062,4.624338624338624

That's a killer trifecta to pin one's hopes on. If you have a few hours of your life that you want to feel you've squandered just to say you've seen this, knock yourself out: you'll feel smarter than police, criminals, and art experts, but not smarter than the people who bailed on this the first time they thought, ""That character/plot element/ unnecessary stylized art historical reference is just silly.""",1486166400,,542,5.101123595505618

8313922,5,B001JXPC6O,"Rock n' roll and art seems like worlds apart, but not as far as Helen Mirren is concerned. Filmed in 1997, when Mirren was 52, she looks breathtaking. Playing a faded blues, Rock n ' roll singer, and Mirren has a nice voice, by the way. She lives near the estate of Sir Charles Stafford in Ireland, and Sir Charles has always been like a father to her. Mirren's character, Maggie Sheridan, is a recluse after years of drugs, music and men.  One evening she hears the estate alarm, and she goes to check on Sir Charles, and she finds him dead. It seems someone stole his art and killed Charles.

The rest of the film is spent trying to find the murderer. Sir Charles son, Sebastian, played by Iain Glen, has drug debts and the police wonder if he is involved.  Maggie becomes involved in the art world, playing a rich woman looking for a special piece of art. This part was a little difficult to believe, but handled well. She goes to London, and Maggie finds herself up to her neck in trouble. The ending is worth waiting for, hang in there.

This is a two piece Masterpiece film for PBS series. I saw it originally on television, and now again. Helen Mirren is just divine, beautiful and a superb actress, what more could we want?
