1644229,1,B00005Q304,"OMG  It's part two of a bad movie.  I didn't know there was a part two. Part one was made in the morning and part two in the afternoon.  I stumbled on part one and rated it ONE star, and this gets no better.  It even starts with the same female workforce scantily clad, male dominators (this time not in a prison, but something quite similar), etc.  The ONLY reason to watch this would be if you just want to see females with nice bodies and no acting ability, and men with even less.  Bad.",1358812800,,490,4.105263157894737
1644230,4,B00005Q304,"This is a fun,slight,silly film. A cartoon.

No one ever ""hated"" the silly James Bond films (esp Goldfinger and To Russia with Love.)
The Batman series is equally cartoonish. The grand-daddie of space opera is the Star Wars franchise.

Best comment: the only 2 intelligent characters in this film are both women,with the nice nipples in T-shirts required in this genre. They never get sweaty,never bruise, and their hair stays well-done.

It's a silly movie..a rental only. But...there are much worse megablockbuster hypes out there playing in your Iowa mall quadplex.",1357862400,2,568,5.21978021978022
1644231,3,B00005Q304,"It's middle of the road. Yes, it's on a low budget, but the acting is fairly done. It could have been  a lot worse. Kari Wuhrer carries the entire movie, the captain of the ship follows closely. The rest of the actors are just along for the ride.

It's always interesting how a hot woman can overcome guys twice her size, get beat up, and not even bruise. ... Only in Hollywood.
Anyway, it's a  good watch for a scifi-action flick, even if you just watch (rent) it once.",1336176000,4,470,4.258426966292135

1644233,4,B00005Q304,"This movie doesn't display any great acting, but it's not expected in a science fiction B-movie. Kari Wuhrer doesn't get naked in movie, but gets to dive in some water and gets her shirt wet. She is trying to save Los Angeles from getting destroyed by sneaking upto bad guy's spaceship and sabotaging it. The lure of the movie for me is it's about a chick who kicks butt. She shoots a gun too.",1266105600,13,393,4.324324324324325
