484117,5,6302593239,"Broadway Serenade is a film I have not come across before. However it is a great film with marvelous musical numbers and great dramatic content. Jeanette fans will love it as it gives her the opportunity to act with other great stars from the MGM stable.
The story line is nothing special,but is still pleasing and has a happy ending,so what's not to love.
Thoroughly recommended.",1351123200,10,380,4.7727272727272725
484118,3,6302593239,"I wanted to give 2 stars, but then maybe some like Tschaikovsky's ""None but the Lonely Heart"" done to death.  Both leads deserved a much better story and more variety in the music.  OK if you're not expecting too much.",1250380800,6,218,4.425
484119,5,6302593239,"The film is over-long, sometimes boring and a typically over-produced, shiny, uninspired MGM picture. But because of Jeannette MacDonald it is ok. One has to wait long until the eccentric Busby Berkeley finale. It is one of his lesser known works but his genius triumphs even at MGM! It is a must for all Berkeley fans and I highly recommend the film because of this few minutes!",1219363200,14,379,4.6716417910447765

The drama  in this movie is very good and it leads up to a very classic and beautiful climax.
If you are a lover of this duo I recommend buying this movie. For the price of it it's definitely worth the purchase.",1372464000,2,326,4.258064516129032
