8009012,4,B00019JR7W,"This very low budget Uruguayan movie, shot in black and white, and somewhat reminiscent of the films of Jim Jarmusch. It tells the story of the aimless adventures of a group of men in their early twenties in  Montevideo. None of them studies, a few of them held to crappy jobs, and their success with women is, much to their chagrin, virtually nil. There is not much to do for them but to kill time around the city with various antics. This is shot not as a drama, but as a comedy, which seems to me to be the right decision. If there is a theme to this movie (and this is clearly not a ""message"" movie) is the lack of meaningful projects for the youth of Uruguay (particularly its males). A useful comparison is with an Argentine movie called 76-89-03, but that film was more corrosive and politically incorrect, and therefore was far more controversial. The directors, Rebella and Stoll, made another film a few years later, Whisky, that it was more polished and mature, and dealt with the hopelessness not of the youth of Uruguay but of its middle aged people. Soon after Whisky, Rebella killed himself with a shotgun, so we don't know whether he would have graduated to a major or important director. A good film, overall.",1218067200,2,1226,4.547511312217194

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

I found 25 Watts in the foreign film section at Borders. After reading the back I was immediately interested because the filmmakers were influenced by Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise), Richard Linklater (Slacker), and Kevin Smith (Clerks). I knew that I had to have this movie, and I was not disappointed. This is a amusing film, well acted too. I'm not from Uruguay (I've never even been outside the US) but everyone can relate to those kind of days when you have nothing to do, or you don't want to do anything. I hope the makers of this film make another one as soon as possble, they are very talented.",1121817600,7,771,4.317241379310345
8009014,4,B00019JR7W,"I was born in Uruguay and lived there until I was 26. Maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. The script deals with the things that usually happens to teenagers that are growing into adulthood (the movie is not about guys in their 20s as the editorial review says!).
I particularly liked the way the movie is filmed, the style is unique and keeps the audience interested by simply showing normal events develop. If you are familiar with Montevideo, then your enjoyment of the movie will surely increase, since you will be visiting known places all over again.
If you are a film enthusiast you must see this movie and be amazed by how much can be achieved with such a low budget!",1073952000,13,686,4.4523809523809526
