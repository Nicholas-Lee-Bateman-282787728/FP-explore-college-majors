The form itself is demonstrated by Yu Xuande and a student. I noticed at times the student's form (foot placement/ hand posture) is somewhat different from that of the instructor. However, the instructor then does the form slowly, repeating the motion in great detail, and explaining the application. This is relatively easy to follow and pick up in a short amount of time.
