7925660,5,B00004WMHQ,"My wife and I love this disc.  We play it 2 or 3 times each Christmas season.  This is the best of a wonderful series of DVDs, although the more recent releases don't seem as quite as strong.
The images here are charming and enhance the Christmas spirit.  The music is simply great -- familiar Christmas songs in arrangements suggestive of Baroque composers.  (I was also delighted to find a MP3 album of this music on Amazon, so I can enjoy it on my iPod too.  There is also a second volume available.
While the match-up between the music and the visuals is not always obvious (for example a gourmet food shop is shown during ""Jolly Old St Nicholas"") they do somehow fit together,  If you watch carefully, every edit in the video (change of angle or scene) occurs at a change of musical phrase.  Incredible.",1509235200,,808,4.493150684931507
7925661,4,B00004WMHQ,"A typical Naxos disk. Music is well-played and the scenery interesting to look at. Not a great disk music wise, but ok. Great for Christmas viewing.",1354665600,,148,4.730769230769231

7925663,5,B00004WMHQ,"THis Naxos DVD has something a little different. The carols and songs have been arrainged by Peter Breinner in the Style of
famous baroque composers which lends a new life to some of the
songs. The visuals are quite seasonal and a pleasure to look at.",1008288000,6,251,4.478260869565218
