I'm a young mom who wants her daughter to grow up with the same amazing movies i did. Nowadays? Everything is about sex, drugs, etc. I'm kindof bored and offended lol. This movie is a beautiful love story, i want it so bad. So if someone could please make it available ? It would make my christmas :)",1319673600,,424,4.182926829268292

I look forward to watching it on TV every year.  It is a movie that everyone must see, especially at Christmas time!",1288396800,,290,4.125

I'm religious and love the message of the movie, however it does not have a religious theme to it. You don't have to have that background to appreciate that it's all about love.  It's about what love really is and what it takes for a man to realize how much he loves his wife and how far he will go to show that love. The ending is perfect. I can't believe they have not made this for every region. Before purchase, I called the company who made one of my DVD players because it did not have the region on it. They told me it would play any region but they lied. The only way I can play this movie is through my portable DVD player.  I can hook my portable DVD player up to play through my TV so the whole family can enjoy the movie.  It will also play on my computer.  The movie is wonderful, but I would caution everyone to make sure they have a way to play it before purchase. I really don't understand why they don't make it for region 1 players.
UPDATE: I found this movie will play on my Blu-ray player. Maybe they aren't region specific but was happy to find I didn't have to go through hooking up my portable just to watch this or watch it on my computer.",1206576000,17,1300,3.9884615384615385
