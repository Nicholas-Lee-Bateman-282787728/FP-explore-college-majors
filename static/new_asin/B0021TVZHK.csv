8349444,4,B0021TVZHK,"A slight disappointment in my ever-increasing collection of Angela Mao flicks.  The story is good and the fights go from pretty good to fantastic, especially for 1976.  Add to that some beautiful footage of Nepal, a rare and fairly explicit sex scene (NOT Angela!), one sweet fighting contribution from Sammo Hung (""Ip Man 2""), and the best kicking performance I've ever seen from Dorian ""Flash Legs"" Tan (""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"")!  The problem is that the movie's two heroes (Mao and Tan) engage in hardly any fisticuffs until the last 10-15 minutes! Of a 2-hour film!  Almost all the fights here belong to Chan Sing (""Return of the One-Armed Swordsman"") as he either picks on or kills pretty much everybody.  And while he does an excellent job, he's not why I bought the thing!  I bought it to watch Ms. Mao kick the crap out of a buncha dudes!

Chan Sing plays Kao, a sadistic misanthrope whose brother earns the ability to marry Tseng Ching Lan (Mao, ""Enter the Dragon""), the daughter of a wealthy provincial governor (Guan Shan, ""Shanghai Express""), whose land and money the duo plan on swiping!  Dorian Tan plays the melancholy Hsu, upset over the socioeconomic status that prevents him from marrying Ms. Mao, as he is her lifelong friend and was taught kung fu by her father.

Until our heroes sneak off to a monastery to solicit training from a Tibetan master of the ancient art of Mi, we have only Kao's Tiger Claw to keep the violence moving.  That and a brief scene that shows Mao and Tan's characters duking it out as children.  A really well-done scene!  Mi seems to be a method of bodily preparedness that one uses with pre-existing kung fu skills to enhance energy and pain threshold. Okay, so Sammo Hung's choreography offers no visual contributions to Mi, but when you have Mr. Tan's AMAZING Tae Kwon Do skills and know how to film them, what else do you need?  In the handful of Angela Mao films that I have seen, she has physically held her own or perhaps even bested super-kickers like Jhoon Rhee (""When Taekwondo Strikes"") and Bruce Leung (""Broken Oath"").  In the finale of this one, it's all Dorian Tan!

The presentation on this Fortune Star remastering of Golden Harvest's production suffers ONLY when compared with the job that Celestial has done for the films of Shaw Brothers.  The widescreen picture is great.  I wish there was an English dub but few, if any, of Fortune Star's releases have one.  The subtitles contain several spelling errors but they're easy to read, as far as visibility is concerned, and easy to follow.  No special features to report.  There may be a photo gallery, I forget.

Though I am bothered by the lack of Angela Mao fight/screen time, this is still a unique and interesting film that is done well in every other aspect.  Had I known going into it that her presence was limited I would likely have enjoyed it a lot more.  Either way I'd have to recommend it.
