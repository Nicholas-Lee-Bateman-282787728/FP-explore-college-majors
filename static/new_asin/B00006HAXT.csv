As another reviewer pointed out, the festivals are covered far too briefly. They clearly tried to put too much into one video. I think the Epiphany segment lasted all of a minute, if that. Not only is each segment far too short, but the information is not always accurate. For example, the history given for the ""throws"" from the Mardi Gras floats (and, in fact, the history of Mardi Gras) is completely wrong. They also given incorrect historical information for Guy Fawkes Day. For that, at least, it's a minor detail (James I was Catholic, not Protestant, and the plot happened because he wasn't bringing England back to the Catholic Church, as Catholics had thought), but inaccuracies are inaccuracies.

Another major problem is the VERY poor editing. The people at Globe Trekker clearly hired young people who just wanted an adventure, not real travel experts with actual knowledge of the events they were exploring.

With this in mind, it's impossible to take Globe Trekker seriously, or the Lonely Planet guides, which one of the young people in the video obviously works for based on the subtle advertisement he does for them.

If you want a basic idea of what's going on in an area of the world you're planning on visiting at the time of your planned trip, there are much better guides out there, like Rick Steves, Froders, or even the Michelin Guides.",1506902400,,1447,4.776
7968948,2,B00006HAXT,"The festivals are colorful and attractive but the DVD has many flaws. They do make it less interesting.  Below are the reasons.

The information is skin-deep. It`s because each festival is covered for only 2 minutes. That's too little information to make me interested in the subject. For example, the scene that shows Tet Festival (Lunar New Year festival) in Viet Nam.  We see the hostess buying Vietnam-style fire crackers. Then, people set fire to them.  Then, the camera showed people visiting pagodas. In fact, there are many other activities people doing during Tet that are omitted.

In short, this type of DVDs inspires my curiosity but does not satisfy it. It`s worth watching once but not purchasing. Luckily, I borrowed it from the local library.",1329264000,,758,4.984126984126984
