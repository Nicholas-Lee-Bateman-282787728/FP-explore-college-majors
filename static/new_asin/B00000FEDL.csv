Though in SP Mode, it has the feel of having been copied a zillion times from a bad EP mode tape. I just learned that VCi has a version of this same Ken Maynard feature. I haven't bought one yet but relying on VCi's track record, I can surmise that that would be a better presentation than this worthless piece of tape.",1056672000,,421,4.410256410256411
