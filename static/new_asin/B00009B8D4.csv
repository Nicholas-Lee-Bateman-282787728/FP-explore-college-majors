7990538,4,B00009B8D4,"I've been a fan of the original Sol Bianca OVA since the late 90s and this six episode series from Pioneer Entertainment, later Geneon, doesn't disappoint. Sol Bianca the Legacy manages to capture, the same vibe of the OVA, but the personalities of the some of the characters take a 180 from the OVA, particularly Feb. In the OVA, Feb was the cool, confident leader of the Sol Bianca crew, but in this installment Feb takes a backseat to April as leader of the crew and is turned into a fragile drunkard. Thankfully, Jun and Jani retain their personalities, but Mayo or ""May"" in the OVA also changed from a mecha-wielding member of the crew to a stowaway who's searching for her family. Despite these changes, I still enjoyed Sol Bianca The Legacy overall.",1437264000,,756,4.649253731343284
7990539,5,B00009B8D4,"Sol Bianca is an amazing sci-fi anime in the vein of Cowboy Bebop/Outlaw Star but with the distinction of the main cast being entirely made up of women. It's an interesting spin on a well-worn subgenre that deserves your attention. It's refreshing to see strong independent women in this genre that are self-reliant and can handle any out of this world problems that come their way. It's a shame that this series is out of print and largely forgotten now. It deserves more attention, recognition, and a continuation! Highly recommended.",1432684800,,536,4.966666666666667

7990541,5,B00009B8D4,love this old school anime.  The story progresses quite nicely.  Make sure you know th order of the disks because the labels are not very clear.,1353888000,,144,4.5
7990542,4,B00009B8D4,Even though I like the original series better it was plagued by the era it came out in being the dark age of anime becoming very low budget.  This new series does have much better production value and the character art is my favorite to this date.  Story's a bit weird and hard to follow as well as the production missing mecha legend Atsushi Takeuchi from the production staff.  All and all though not bad for anybody that likes space opera adventure.,1317513600,,452,4.487804878048781
7990543,3,B00009B8D4,"Not really impressed with the animation, and since this has a previous storyline I didn't quite catch on until half way thru",1314748800,,124,4.681818181818182
7990544,3,B00009B8D4,"Winter of 1992 I was introduced to an English Subtitled tape of Sol Bianca...  Yes, it was good, it had its interesting points... Sol Bianca 2, however, seemped to ramp things up a bit.( And left you in a seriously big lurch at the end, making me wish there was more out there)

However, that clifhanger ending of Sol Bianca 2 was what made the previous reviewer's comment about Jun's association with the ship click in my head.  I've got the first tape, looking forward to the remaining 4 episodes.",1149724800,,499,4.522222222222222
