3847561,2,B0024O9LMS,"I didn't really care for this video.  I felt like we were jerking around too much.  The movements were not very fluid and there weren't enough repetitions to feel comfortable.  She also changes positions rapidly (we're on the chair, we're off the chair, now the floor, now a bench, and back to the chair again).  Most of my workout was repeatedly rearranging the living room!  Also, the assistants in the background were a little too perky and fakey for me.  I'm going to stick with Pilates.",1324425600,17,491,4.651162790697675
3847562,3,B0024O9LMS,"This video is nice, but I think it's definitely more for beginners than more advanced exercisers.  It's low impact and slow paced, but it does have decent exercises and I really enjoy Leisa Hart as an instructor.",1323648000,2,212,4.72972972972973
3847563,2,B0024O9LMS,I wasn't happy with this. Only cause I expected more. If you are looking for basic easy go with this. If you are looking for more intense and better go with Jari Love: Get Ripped & Chiseled and SWAT Workout: Ultimate Body Definition...those are way great!,1316390400,,255,4.565217391304348
3847564,5,B0024O9LMS,I really enjoy this workout video.  It is well thought out and does a great job sculpting your arms!,1312502400,4,100,4.2631578947368425
3847565,3,B0024O9LMS,"""This DVD is recommended for beginners because there are not may reps or sets, slower paced, lightweights are used throughout and there are many options and modifications. I'll say this much, the set is really nice and Leisa is backed up by two well-coiffed smiling ladies. Leisa offers a lot of equipment one can use, such as...pillows! for chest work, if you don't have a step nor a bench. But, you need a chair because there are routines where she works from sitting on a no-arm chair. Yoga is an option on the menu, 10 minutes of a couple of rounds of the sun salutation using the band during warrior positions. It's a less serious and easy-going yoga segment. Again, this DVD is definitely for beginners or for people who want a less intense workout for your arms.""",1263340800,55,770,4.586956521739131
3847606,1,B0024O9LMS,Not Tamilee Webb. This video is boring.,1468713600,,39,4.714285714285714
3847607,5,B0024O9LMS,"I know a lot of people might laugh at this video, but I love it.  I exercise regularly, but have tendonitis in both elbows so doing anything with weights has been a no-no.  However, I am not really happy with my arms these days and decided to try this with low weight.  It is easy, I feel that it is an appropriate workout and it is fun.  I know that in the future I can totally modify this with much heavier weights.  It is great for beginners and I think those with injuries (check with doctor).  The movements are a tad fast, as I prefer to work more slowly and concentrate on form.  Once I learn the routines, I'll turn down the sound and turn up my own music.  I do all of the routines at once, every other day and am confident that I will see results quickly.",1465516800,6,765,4.087248322147651

3847629,2,B0024O9LMS,"Disappointed. The title of this DVD is misleading. Should be arms of tin foil rather than steel. Light toning in comparison to another DVD I purchased recently by Jari Love ""Revved to the Max"" which really works the arms. May be useful for rest days or for those who are very very new to weights workouts. Light toning but if you want muscle development (for strength building) this is not the DVD for it.",1422144000,3,405,4.486486486486487

3847634,1,B0024O9LMS,Most ridiculous workout video ever!!!,1405036800,,37,6.6
3847635,2,B0024O9LMS,"Wow- this was the very first ""Of Steel"" workout program that I have tried. I assumed it would be difficult (you know, so that my arms would be as hard as steel), but I was very wrong. This is a beginner program. It is probably a great program for someone who is older and has never worked his/her arms.

If you are familiar with different arm and shoulder exercises, and have ever weight trained before, do not buy this video! It was so easy it was laughable.",1403740800,,459,4.275862068965517
3847646,4,B0024O9LMS,"Fantastic video. It works wonders. I would have given it 5 stars if the instructor would not rush so fast that sometimes you can hardly follow. If you watch carefully, the same problem have the other participants who join the instructor.

The DVD has several segments and a mini yoga segment as bonus at the end. Every segment is 10 minutes long and has a warm up of its own so it is possible to do what ever you want. Even so I would suggest to do every time the first segment as this has the longest warm up and after that choose one of the other ones to combine.  After doing it the first days you will feel that you have muscles where you never thougt you had some.  After 1 or 2 weeks doing it 5 times a week I could do the whole thing and after a month I could see my arms changing. I must say from the start I used much havier weights than suggested.",1401494400,,857,4.029411764705882
3847647,2,B0024O9LMS,I was expecting more out of this workout. It was too easy and inconsistent. I prefer workouts with strong repetitions and this one was constantly changing. I was actually concerned about spraining my wrists.,1398384000,,207,5.117647058823529
3847648,1,B0024O9LMS,"Not a workout for arms that will really tone them.  I prefer JIllian Michaels anyday.  Definetly a bad buy, not worth it",1394668800,,120,4.409090909090909
3847649,4,B0024O9LMS,I like this arms of steel tone and tighten I am liking it more and more every day I don't see the progress as of yet but I hope to see that sooner or later so far it is a good tape. I will tell every one about it so they too can give it a try. thank you.,1393113600,2,254,3.3220338983050848
3847650,5,B0024O9LMS,Great workout for all levels!  I enjoyed using this program. I reccommend it to the beginner and I am already showing results.,1389312000,6,126,4.7272727272727275
3847651,4,B0024O9LMS,easy to follow and effective. I used it two months before my wedding and deffanitly noticed a difference in the tone of my arms.,1388620800,,128,4.375
3847652,4,B0024O9LMS,This is a great workout that really zeros in on just the arms. If your a person that just wants their arms toned then this is the video for you. I started this video last week but I have to 8 pound weights instead of 3 because I don't feel like its a good workout with the 3s. Once I used the 8 pounds I noticed a difference already. I will continue to use this video to tone my arms and gain more muscle.,1388448000,5,405,3.8333333333333335
3847653,5,B0024O9LMS,"I hope I will love my 4 week results! Ill definitly let everyone know, but the rest I got it in a timely fashion but then again the results won't be the sellers fault it would be the actual dvd so this seller should stay a 5 star for doing what they said they would get done. thank you",1385942400,,285,3.847457627118644

3847661,5,B0024O9LMS,This video is fantastic. The instructor is easy to listen to and follow.  The exercises are easy to do also.  I like how it combines some arm exercises with squat like forms that make you use your legs or abs too-to increase muscle use.,1369267200,7,236,4.340909090909091
3847662,5,B0024O9LMS,Exercises change quickly so do it a few times to get the hang of it. I'm 50 and had the flab upper arms. This tightened whole arm wonderfully. Did everyday for 6 months.,1360454400,35,169,4.151515151515151
