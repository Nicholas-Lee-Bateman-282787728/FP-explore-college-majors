3986788,1,B002TZS5MY,"Reading the product description at a DVDXPress kiosk, I immediately knew who ""the other man"" was. It was just so obvious. But intrigued by the nice still shot of Brittany Murphy, I decided to rent it anyway. After all, it was only a buck.

What a big disappointment! I want my dollar (plus tax) back! The movie is just absolutely terrible in every way, except perhaps camerawork (no shaky shots like those shot on a handheld). The plot, despite the obvious, is just plain boring and empty. To fill the time, the pace of the film is very slow, and the dialogs are extremely corny and annoying. Murphy (I hate to say this, being a fan of hers) looks like she's about to die, and she and the two male leads simply cannot act. The set design is so like one taken out of my high school's senior play.

This film tries hard at being stylish, but it's not. It's a bad, bad, bad film.",1268956800,10,876,4.303030303030303
3986789,4,B002TZS5MY,"It's worth peering through the deep murk of the photographic filters used on this film to see what's going on. There's a reveal along its course that is virtually guaranteed to make you gasp! After that, it unfolds as a well crafted nail-biter, with several scenes building to Hitchcockian levels of tension.

The story is told in jigsaw puzzle fashion - with some flashbacks juxtaposed against what is presumably current action. However the technique doesn't come off as arty artifice here. It works, adding to the taut dichotomy of now-this-hotel-room/now-the room-across-the-hall - with that dangerous expanse of no man's land in between.

The taut rope of action is also stretched across the uneasy territory between realism and surrealism. But again, this specific kind of noir atmosphere works in this case. Once you get moving into the spirit of the film, you feel its drifting, unanchored quality, with its windows all heavily draping out any specifics of time and place - to be integral to the action rather than just another directorial attempt to cop an artistic award.

This subtle nudge towards surrealism makes the movie linger with you all the more hauntingly. While the major plot questions are resolved, you'll probably be left with other, more personal questions about the characters, taunting you to go back and perhaps fit the pieces of the film together a little differently in your mind. What was the nature of the friendship between the two lead actors, such that one felt impelled to phone the other right in the middle of pillow talk, in order to tell him he'd just proposed to that girl lying next to him - the girl of his dreams? And could there really exist a hotel bellhop/night clerk with such a creepy, conspiratorial cast to his welcoming? He seems to be simultaneously preternaturally knowing about the real intentions of those who check into the hotel - and preternaturally opaque to all human folly. Who is he - really?

All around, this was a surprisingly intelligent, eerie, murder mystery noir. I would have given it five stars except for the frustrating obscurity of the way it projected on my TV screen. All the pains taken to set a scene are wasted. For example, in the extras on this DVD, they have a ""Making of..."" that points out how a picture of the Titanic was portentously hung in the hotel corridor. Well, there's no chance of making out that detail or any other such detail on your home screen if you have a somewhat older TV such as mine. Then the faces too often looked like smudged fingerprints emerging from some impenetrable gloom. However, Brittany Murphy manages to shine through. She is at her limpid, translucent best here, and the film can serve as a worthy memorial.",1267488000,11,2726,4.843347639484978
3986790,4,B002TZS5MY,"Considering this film was released in only a handful of theaters, I was surprised at how entertaining it was.  I was impressed most with the work of Alex Merkin, who makes his film debut with Across the Hall.

Visually, this film is a real treat.  The movie takes place in an aging hotel, which becomes a character in itself.  The lighting, shadows, use of color and weather all contribute towards making this a fun film noir to soak in.  Another treat is the film's score, which combines big band (Starlight Serenade by the Alan Moorhouse Orchestra) and contemporary music.  Much of the movie's score is original music by composer Aaron Kaplan, and psychedelic folk rock group Calico Haunts.

While I was unfamiliar with lead actor Mike Vogel, I was already a fan of Danny Pino's work portraying druglord Armadillo Quintero on The Shield.  Pino does a convincing job in Across the Hall playing Terry, the vengeful lover.  Brad Greenquist, whose career has primarily been in television, adds to the peculiar vibe of the film as the hotel's quirky porter.

This was a tense thriller that pulled me in from the very first scene, and the excellent opening title sequence.  It's not a breakthrough film, but if you're a fan of neo-noir in the vein of 21 Grams or Seven, you will probably enjoy it.",1265846400,23,1293,4.727678571428571
3986791,5,B002TZS5MY,"If you like ""noir"" and period thrillers, Across the Hall is a movie worth watching.  The suspense is gripping and the surprise is worth waiting for.  The period decor is beautiful and the music is like a extra character.  Well acted and Brittany is a treat.  Already sadly missed.",1265587200,4,280,4.653061224489796
3986792,3,B002TZS5MY,"""Across the Hall"" is a suspense drama, and without revealing much about what you will see in it, all I can say is that the story is largely set in a seedy hotel called the Riverview, and the film is about three main characters: Terry (Danny Pino), his best friend Julian (Mike Vogel) and Terry's new sweetheart June (Brittany Murphy). Julian gets a call from Terry in the rainy night, and Julian knows instantly that his best friend, obviously agitated, has discovered something about his fiance. Julian hurries to the hotel room where Terry stays, only to find that things are much more complicated than he thought.

Or are they? ""Across the Hall"" employs a non-linear narrative to set up its noir-like thriller situation. Some of the major events (not many) are strongly suggested in the earlier part, and the audiences are required to put the fragmented pieces of information about what happened at the two hotel rooms. Unlike Christopher Nolan films, however, the truths are not as surprising as the film wants us to think. The wrap-up part in the third act is certainly neat and beautifully done, but the whole story is, once told, looks too incredible, even preposterous.

Perhaps my disappointment has something to do with the film's origin. ""Across the Hall"" is helmed by first-time feature director Alex Merkin. Merkin has also directed a short ""Across the Hall"" in 2005, upon which this feature-length version is based. Some part of the feature version (about the porter and his fellow workers, for instance) seems to be there just to pad out the running time.

Though her role is not fleshed out sufficiently, Brittany Murphy is impressive. Almost single-handedly she brings something sweet and attractive to the rather blandly-written character she plays. I miss her.",1265068800,3,1779,4.983164983164984
3986793,1,B002TZS5MY,"Across the Hall (2009) is about a dull man seeking revenge on a cheating Brittany Murphy in a deficient attempt at film noir.  This film is inadequate, inferior, and unsatisfactory on all levels.  It is an insensitive love triangle gone intolerable and that is all.

It's a below average film with a flawed, predictable twist. Nothing is too eye-popping about it.
It's a very drudging film, too feebleminded for my brilliant tastes. None of the actors give credible performances, but the hotel assistant provides the most believable execution in his trivial role.

There are no adequate actors in the entire film, and the majority of the film was shot in an indistinct studio hotel, mainly on the inside.

If you're bored, read a book.  Skip it.",1264377600,10,745,4.873015873015873
3986794,4,B002TZS5MY,"I have had a volume of customers asking for those last three known films of Brittany and so far this looks like the best, if not most obscure/noirish of them.

The story follows several people during one evening of betrayal, love and murder in one retro NY hotel. I had not really seen the main two guys before so I have nothing to compare them with, but Brittany looked wonderful and filled the role adequately of the betraying fiancee caught in the middle of her mess. Brad Greenquist plays the aged and loner bellhop who has a pivotal role by the conclusion. The camera work, editing and music make this a noir-style slow burn suspense idea with lots of filler and (at times) frivolous dialogue. The Blu was solid though.

The picture clarity was very adequate even though these were all dimly lit sets and nighttime exteriors with neon and rain. The line definition never falters and the colors (tons of red in this) were full and worthy of a dark test. Brittany's pale skin/makeup shines beautifully in this and her whole performance was worthy (and after watching the supplements it was nice to see this was something she really wanted to partake in). The DTS was competent, though not tested to any extreme until that music montage finale from 1:27:00 to 1:30:00. The supplements include (all lodef unfortunately):

* Making of, 12:36 minutes. Interview heavy that recaps the entire story.
* Working with the Director, 2:27 minutes. Do not care for those fluff pieces like this.
* The Call, 2:16 minutes. Covers how they tried to keep the amount of calls in this realistic for acting them out.
* Working with Friends, 2:22 minutes. Fluff piece again, if you are looking for any additional Brittany footage it is in the main documentary only.

Region coded A, with English SDH and Spanish subs only. Aside from the leaps one has to have to believe the novice ending (writing issues) I liked the look of the film, the BD and that last music mix. 3.5 for the performances (mostly Brittany) and noir look and .5 for the BD clarity.",1263859200,9,2034,4.673184357541899

3986805,5,B002TZS5MY,"Intriguing, yes. Across the Hall is being called a Film Noir these days, which is fair. It does have some familiar qualities, specifically the singular setting of an old hotel (Don't Bother To Knock, and um....The Shining? Blasphemy!) as well as a love triangle of violence (Human Desire). There's also a visual reference to Nightmare Alley. However, the delivery of the dialog, particularly by the two male leads, is a bit unnatural. Also, certain elements seem out of place throughout the movie: snap-button western shirts, cell phones that beep whenever they are used, taking a bath (wtf?) and parking a car directly in front of a downtown hotel (hell no). The story is unique, but suffers from lack of backstory regarding the characters. Indeed, I found myself asking ""who's she?"" ""what's he doing?"" What happened to his knee?"" and ""How slow are these elevators?"" and even ""Dark City?"", that is, when I wasn't saying ""wtf"" about the bath tub.
Brittany was great, and I'd say Across the Hall was a good movie for her to end with, sadly. Overall it was good, it just takes some time to get into the atmosphere of pearl-snaps and foreign cell phone/beepers. RIP Murphy.

3986812,5,B002TZS5MY,"For those who enjoy film noir in general and Alfred Hitchcock in particular, this movie is for you. Take two best friends, one adulterous affair, a former girl friend, a weird major bellhop, and an aged once noteworthy hotel with few occupants - shake well - and you have all the makings of an often perplexing yet gripping thriller filled with surprises. The numbers 508, 507, and 304 will take on new meaning as this ""roller coaster"" of a story unfolds.

Mike Vogel (recently of Bates Motel, Pan Am, Grind) and Danny Pino (Cold Case, Law & Order) are best friends. The latter's fiance (Brittany Murphy) is cheating on him. Pino knows it (how is not revealed), follows her to The Riverview Hotel where he assumes she will be meeting her lover, bribes the bellhop into renting him the room across from where Murphy is staying, and spies through the peep hole window in his door determined to learn the identity of Murphy's lover. In the meantime, Pino calls his best buddy Vogel to come to the hotel because he needs him.  Before all of this takes place, however, we see the arrival of Murphy at the hotel and a sequence of scenes involving Vogel, and separately the bellhop entering Room 507 after removing police tape placed in front of the room's door. We soon realize that we are dealing with a series of flashbacks which initially can seem confusing but all falls into place very quickly. Careful attention must be paid to everything going on, especially any details that may seem unimportant at first. This shifting of time goes on throughout the rest of the film but that's what makes it fun.

Pino finally thinks that he has caught Murphy's lover. A struggle ensues with Murphy who is accidentally shot and killed with a gun that Pino has stolen from Vogel. Later, Pino wants Vogel to shoot the purported lover for him in order to cover things up and confuse the issue for the police.
From this point on, there is one twist after another and all is not as it seems, though the viewer already knows this from previous scenes. It is the final twists that give this neo-noirish film its real kick, and it is left to the audience to individually judge whether the final denoument is satisfying and justified.

This movie definitely did NOT drag and reminded me most of all of Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"" (Grace Kelley, Robert Cummings), with a hint of ""Rope"" (Jimmy Stewart) and ""Strangers on a Train"" (Robert Walker, Farley Granger) - just a ""hint""!

3986821,5,B002TZS5MY,"First, I have to point out that this is the last movie starring Brittany Murphy that was released in her lifetime. She was excellent in this excellent movie, and I hope she knew it.  Another reviewer here on Amazon has stated that she is in only '15 minutes' of the movie.  That's completely untrue.  She is one of the three main actors in this film -- she played a major role, and did it very well.  Her appearance is not just some kind of cameo.

That said ... There's a story about this story, and it's worth knowing before you watch this movie.  Alex Merkin, the director, had an idea ... a sort of noir / 'locked room' hybrid, and it is one hell of a great plot.  If James M. Cain, Jim Thompson, or especially Cornell Woolrich had written this story back in the day, Fox or RKO would have snapped it up (and Otto Preminger would have directed) -- ""Across the Hall"" would have made Noir and Hollywood history.  The story really is that good.  (The role cell phones play in the movie ... really the only modern element ... could easily have been replaced with another plot device -- car keys, notes, whatever -- and probably should have been, to keep this great plot truly timeless.)

I think Alex Merkin knew what he had with this story back in 2006, when he and screenwriter Julien Schwab developed the story into a 16-minute short, also called ""Across the Hall.""  Virtually every line and scene in this 16-minute masterpiece also appears in the 'long' version, released in 2009.  And the 'long' version, which is the subject of this review -- and also is written by Schwab and directed by Merkin -- doesn't just expand on its 16-minute predecessor, it improves on it in every way.

This isn't 'neo-noir,' as with a modern film that borrows elements from that genre.  No, as stated above, this is something that Cornell Woolrich could have written in 1940, if he'd thought of it.  ""Across the Hall"" would fit comfortably in any vintage film noir anthology -- except it's in color and was made a half-century after the golden age of 'classic' film noir.  Even ""Chinatown"" (I film I love, a lot) doesn't have, and doesn't try for, the claustrophobic, heart-pounding sense of minutes slipping away as fate closes in on the hapless protagonists  --  and that's the basis of all classic film noir.

In case you can't tell, I love this film!",1305417600,12,2340,4.541766109785203
3986822,4,B002TZS5MY,"Although the average rating on Amazon is about 3 stars as I type my review for this movie I would have to give it 4 out of 5. My attention span is really bad and a movie generally has to bring it in dialogue, action, acting, scenery, and audio to keep me attentive. This movie does that. You certainly don't need me to give you a synopsis of the movie because that has been provided in the description; however, I will say that this movie has two major twist that I was able to figure out. Someone called the movie predictable, I'd rather just call it familiar. The fact that some plots are ""guessable"" does not take a way from the movie. The movie collocates past and present scenes which gives the film a more interesting ""feel"" than some other films within it's genre that share similar plots.  Now, would I purchase this movie from Amazon for nearly $15.00? Absolutely not! I just watched it for free on Hulu. That being said your needs may differ from mine and you may actually need the DVD version and in that case go right ahead.

3986827,5,B002TZS5MY,"*As will appear in the October 2010 issue of Twisted Dreams Magazine, alongside an interview with Brad Greenquist - the Porter.

Your Mistress Macabre LOVES a good Noir movie. The trouble is - in today's world of CGI and stunt driven over-the-top remakes and some just plain garbage that makes its way to the screen - it's next to impossible to find.

But Across The Hall is proof positive that a good movie does not have to have theatrical release. In fact, I'm finding this more and more.

Step aside, Hollywood...your glory days are long behind you, with the rubbish you're greenlighting. Say ""Hello"" to the future...Independently produced, filmed and distributed movies.

A premier example of all the right stuff...Across The Hall.

Wow...what a movie!

Admittedly, the only reason I even watched this movie is because I'm a huge fan of the magnificently talented actor, Brad Greenquist (if you've read this terrible tome, cover-to- cover like good little ghouls, you've already read his fabulous interview with little old moi!) and like to show my support because I feel he is so underrated in Hollywood.

Once again he stood out like a lightning bolt in a storm. The movie being so great anyway - that was just gravy.

In what would be one of Brittany Murphy's last movie performances, at the risk of sounding crass and completely unfeeling (not the first time I've been accused) I have to say... ""Brittany honey - what a way to go out!""

Meet Terry (Danny Pino) a young man who's found out that his fiance (Murphy) has checked into a hotel with another man for a little tryst.

Consumed with rage and hurt, he decides to go kill them both. The only thing stopping him, so far, is his best friend Julian (Mike Vogel) whom he calls throughout the movie.

So what? `Sounds boring' you say, two guys talking on a cell phone throughout the movie? Well, let me tell you, it is much more complicated than that and at the risk of giving the entire movie away, I can't say any more.

Let's just say that things are not what they seem and with the entrance of the creepy Porter (Greenquist) who endures disrespect from not only his lazy co-workers...but also the patrons that check in and seems to know far more than people wish to know about the rundown hotel he takes meticulous care of...this movie should make Noir history!

Brad Greenquist adds a calm weirdness to this movie that will chill you. His mannerisms, his slow and methodical actions - let's just say that I'm not too sure I'd stay in a hotel if he was a porter, like in Across The Hall. Oh and that's a good thing - when you can creep me out!

With a 1930's feel and a tense suspense that - by the time the movie is over - will have you exclaiming aloud (as I did) ""NO WAY!"" this is one movie not to be missed.

The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that, at times, it's slow. But...you'll find that building the storyline so that it can all come crashing into place (and boy does it!) is a necessity.

I give this movie a 9.5 out of a Twisted 10 and must add an, I NEED MORE, for one heck of a movie that this depraved diva of darkness, wishes they'd make more of.

3986828,1,B002TZS5MY,"This pathetic excuse for a film COULD have MAYBE been interesting if it had been directed any better and if some of the cast had been changed.  It was so slow and so boring and so over-acted I could not even force myself to watch the end of it.  The plot was too stupid {even for a movie}, its too unbelievable that no one called the cops.  All the characters were cardboard cut-out actors pretending to act, even Murphy sucked.  If you think this is really a ""noir"" style film I feel sorry for you.  See some real noir to get an education on it. The film was like a bunch of teenagers getting themselves in stupid situation.  No one came off as an adult or a real personality, or dimensional or interesting. Nothing. Very annoying movie. Don't bother !",1281830400,6,753,4.3428571428571425
3986829,4,B002TZS5MY,"This film is an overlooked gem which did not make it big in the theatre.  Brittany Murphy has the lead female role.  Danny Pino is her boyfriend (or husband) Terry.  Mike Vogel is Terry's best friend Julian, and Brad Greenquist has a scene-stealing role as the hotel bellboy.

The central plot of the movie involves ""June""-that would be Brittany--checking into a seedy, run-down hotel (somewhere in the Hollywood area it seems), and her paranoid husband Terry, who is continuously convinced she must be cheating on him.  He has FOLLOWED her to this hotel and he checks into the room ACROSS THE HALL, from which he can observe anyone who goes into or out of the room.  Oh yeah--and he's got a gun, and he's been drinking pretty hard....

Well, cellphones make quite a showing in the film.  Terry calls his friend Julian to give him the bad news that his wife really IS cheating on him because after all there she is, in that seedy hotel waiting for someone.  Julian is alarmed that Terry is going to do something rash--especially when he finds out about the gun...Terry don't do anything rash man--wait--I'm coming over--just wait for me....

The tension, which is maintained almost from beginning to end of this film, is broken ONLY by the BELLBOY--This guy has to be seen to be believed.  I think he should have gotten an Oscar for best minor-supporting role.  He's the only one in the whole hotel who takes his job seriously.  You'd think he was the manager of Trump Towers.  Unfortunately at this place, you can now pay ""by the hour"" as one option.  Still he dresses in one of those formal old bellboy outfits from...the 30's?  20's?  The red coat and that ridiculous red, flat bellboy hat, with a white strap that goes under the chin (A look similar to the dress of a monkey that sits on the shoulder of an organ-grinder).  He was hilarious, while being completely serious at all times.  I LOVE THIS GUY!

The storyline is nonlinear and you have to give it credit: this is no adaptation from a book or a short story or a play.  This is a script which can ONLY WORK in a movie.  The scenes start sort of midway through the movie and from there they keep cutting back toward the start and then forward to continue.  It starts out a little bit confusing, but it draws you in and hooks you.  It isn't until near the end of the film that you can sort out the whole story from beginning to end.  And what an ending!  The entire film builds toward this ending and it is perfectly executed.  I couldn't predict the ending (maybe some of you can) but it's powerfully done (with almost no dialog) and the musical score greatly adds to the effect.  This is a film that just continually builds up momentum until the finish, which is good enough to be taught in film school.  I watched this film twice-something I don't do that often.  It's definitely worth seeing.",1277164800,5,2856,4.521484375
3986830,1,B002TZS5MY,"While there is sufficient eye candy for most teenagers, a pretty girl, a creepy motel with a equally creepy bellhop etc, the story line is sub-standard.  The whole movie was in a word, predictable.  It is a premise that in my opinion has been done to death IE: Guy steals his friends girl / friend wants revenge / sets up the guy for the fall...  The actors however, are reasonable, notably the eerie / half-crazy bell boy (who steals the show IMO) & most of the acting is fine.  In fact, top notch in a few places but the material is just BAD & their acting wasted on this plot-less drivel.  The movie aims to be clever but falls pathetically short of the mark.

If you liked ""B"" 1950 style drive-ins you'll love the plot line.  If not stay away, rent something else & pray the actors can get other jobs (and smarter agents) after this.",1275523200,7,837,4.326923076923077
3986831,3,B002TZS5MY,"A good film noir attempt set in a sleazy hotel with an odd porter.  COLD CASE star Danny Pino plays a neurotic man who believes girlfriend Brittany Murphy is cheating on him and follows her to the Riverview Hotel and waits across the hall to see who her lover is.  Pino enlists his best friend Mike Vogel to help him after a tragedy occurs.
There are some plotholes and improbable actions but the movie held my interest and Pino and Vogel are quite good.  Nice effort from the first time director.",1274313600,5,497,4.43956043956044
3986832,2,B002TZS5MY,"Unlike several other reviewers I thought the acting in this film was decent and that the production values were terrific.  The movie maintains a neo-noir atmosphere with some very richly shot camera work, shadowy lighting, great art direction and costume design along with an effective score.  The out-of-sequence story telling is easy to follow and the director reveals plot points in a way that kept me interested (mostly).  There were times when the direction became too self-indulgent.  What other reviewers have tagged as bad acting I think was the director pacing the film down in several spots where he should not have.

I only gave the film two stars because the story has a couple of glaring holes that render the plot completely absurd.  There are times when the behavior of certain characters is simply so bizarre that their actions are obviously driven by the needs of the story and not by the needs of the characters that have been established.  The most glaring example:  Brittney Murphy is left alone in her hotel room after learning that her husband is in the room across the hall with murderous intent.  She looks out the peephole in the door and sees another hotel guest walking by in his robe with an empty ice bucket.  What does she do?  She opens the door and quietly, but frantically, tells the poor guy: ""It's not safe in the hall.""  She then proceeds to try to pull him into her room where it will presumably be safer because that's the very place where her insanely jealous husband is focusing his rage.  Right.  In a psychological thriller like this, once behavior goes off the rails, why bother?

There were also a couple of character absurdities that were added not just to serve the plot but to increase the irony of the story.  These elements weakened the film and were entirely unnecessary for any reason.  A prime example: After cheating on her husband (I think it's her husband--with all the time shifting, it's not quite clear whether they're married or still engaged), the Brittany Murphy character, still in bed with her lover, turns to him and, speaking of her husband, says: ""I love him.  I wanted to make sure it was my love I was feeling--not just his love.""  There are many reasons one might cheat on a spouse, but that one is just way too hard to swallow.  I laughed out loud.

Overall, I'd say there are better choices in this genre.  I'd skip this one.",1272153600,4,2396,4.6682577565632455
3986833,5,B002TZS5MY,"I'm very glad that some people still know how to make a good movie.  I'm also glad I'm not the only person who recognized that this is noir; or at least ""neo""-noir.  People who think this kind of movie is bad disqualify themselves from the possibility of making worthwhile aesthetic judgments in the first place.",1270944000,,312,4.654545454545454
3986834,4,B002TZS5MY,"The tense stand-off between a young man, his unfaithful fiance, and his best friend. Terry's fiance, June, is having an affair. After following June to a run-down hotel on the far side of town, Terry quietly rents a room across the hall. With a bottle of whiskey and a loaded gun, he calls his best friend, Julian, and spills his guts. Realizing that it's only a matter of time before Terry goes off, Julian begs his friend to remain calm long enough for him to get to the hotel and diffuse the situation. Mike Vogel and Danny Pino were great in this movie and it is a great thriller with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer intrigued to the end. Brittany Murphy's she is just a bit player that lasted maybe 15 minutes of the movie, but does do a good job.  All in all, I liked this movie keeps you guessing.
