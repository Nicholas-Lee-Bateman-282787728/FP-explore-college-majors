8164875,3,B000LXGVTU,"This movie is about a medical student (Kirti Reddy) who wins a scholarship to study in Scotland. The award is donated and presented by a wealthy businessman (Sunil Shetty) who falls in love with her and wants to marry her. She declines his proposal. He is smitten (to the point of obsession - and is used to being able to buy anything he wants). He hires a poor actor (Arjun Rampal) who is skilled with woman to win her for him for a large amount of money. Meanwhile The girl has become the object of interest for the son of a wealthy NRI Indian (played by lesser known Aftab Shivdasani) living in a Scottish castle. The actor naturally falls for the girl while he is playing out the scheme. Who will get the girl?...

I found this pretty average as a movie. The settings are nice, the music OK but not memorable and they resolved the movie emotionally in a satisfying enough way. The big reason to buy it is Arjun Rampal who not only looks marvelous throughout but acts quite well in this his first movie after being a top model. He won an award for this as 'Best Newcomer'.

Now I did have misgivings about this. A lot of that was that I didn't relate to the main lady who is on a lot. She comes on angry at the beginning when declining the proposal (even though there was no real reason for this as she only had to say 'no thank you' and he was still her generous benefactor either way) She continued to often have a sour look that undermined my connecting with her as romance object. The premise of the movie is a little dodgy too (and the scritping a bit lacklustre). If Arjun was talented with ladies Sunil could have paid for him to coach him to win the lady rather than weaving such a deceptive plot. However this is Bollywood and if everyone was honest and open the plots would all run to about 5 minutes!

Anyway Arjun and the other lead and support actors are good. In fact one of the support girls would have made a more satisfying lead. There end up being multiple pairings as the story plays out.

Elsewhere on the Net it tends to score mostly average, and that's what I'd give it too. Will keep it for Arjun.",1246060800,,2123,4.286783042394015
