7739305,5,B01EP1NVXM,"- Synopsis: The continuation of the first part. Ange's life went from peaceful to dreadful in the blink of an eye. However, refusing to give in to despair, she chooses to reject the world. For it was nothing but hypocrisy and suffering; a painful lesson she discovers throughout the series. At first she lived with a simple purpose: to kill rather than be killed.

That all changes when yet another eventful experience changes her perspective and calls upon the justifications of her actions. With a new set of allies and enemies, Ange once again stares death in the eyes as she refuses to give into the harsh reality that is forced upon her. Rather than waiting for opportunity, she'll shoot her way out and carve a path for herself.

- Comments: Much of the content in here may be too mature for many viewers to handle. Mainly due to the amount of fan-service and yuri-like situations in this anime. I believe this anime is highly misunderstood, as well.

- Analysis: However, this goes to show the viewer that the real world isn't sunshine and flowers. It's a rough world with discrimination, prejudice, hypocrisy, injustice, and other various concepts. If you cannot learn to adapt, you will be eaten alive. Like in High School of the Dead. Further emphasizing that many people often live sheltered or otherwise a peacefully ignorant life while other suffer else where.

It's unfortunate that many people are ignorant or refuse to accept the truth. Specifically, that there's diversity between people and cultures. However, most people tend to focus on what makes others different from themselves and fail to recognize what makes them similar. Topics regarding religion and politics tend to both divide and categorize others. Which is interesting and bitter-sweet. Of course, there's no way everyone will see eye-to-eye, it's unfortunate that many arguments are the result of petty squabbles, instead of constructive criticism or discussions.

- Conclusion: If you don't care much for ecchi or fan-service in general, I would probably stay away (but isn't that most animes). Still, Ange is one fine piece of work. This anime also details many things in life that aren't pretty such as discrimination, hypocrisy, injustice, prejudice, and many other concepts.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes episodes 13-25 on 2 Blu-ray discs that have an approximate run-time of 5 hours. This anime is designated with the TV-MA rating due to violence, blood and gore, and heavy sexual content. There isn't any nudity.
