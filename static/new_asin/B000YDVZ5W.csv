3027707,5,B000YDVZ5W,"I first found out about Ethan from an email with his appearance on Jay Leno.  I watched it every time I needed to smile.  He has amazing talent, is captivating and charming, and has a fun personality.  I think the DVD is very well done and showcases all of Ethan's assets.  I would highly recommend for anyone of any age.",1195344000,,321,4.3
3027708,5,B000YDVZ5W,"As one of Ethan's biggest fans, I knew that I would love his DVD, and I do. However, even I wasn't prepared to be so completely charmed and captivated by this unique insight into Ethan's world. And the music is stunning - from the opening notes of the Star Spangled Banner to the final chords of ""Sun and Sky"". (Which, by the way, is achingly beautiful.)  I cried when I heard the full version of ""Tiger Ran Away at the Zoo, so sweet and dark and brilliant.

Ultimately, ""By Me"" is a joyful adventure, and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves life, loves to have fun, and is ready to be amazed by this sweet young man with a passion for animals and music, music and animals!",1194825600,8,680,4.263565891472868

3027731,5,B000YDVZ5W,"My daughters love it.
they like his voice, the animals and  music. We watch this dvd just for entertainment. Dont expect the kids to learn from the DVD how to play the piano.
Personally I like how Ethan imagined what the animals do in some parts of the music. it was cute.
My older daughter is almost 3 and the younger is 1  1/2 year old. For now they like it, and they play with their piano toy more, the younger even pretends she plays like Ethan with both hands and everything.",1383523200,3,480,4.206521739130435
3027732,3,B000YDVZ5W,He's a cute boy and very talented.  I would have liked more info. on how he has fared since the time the video was made.  Has his life been positiively or negatively affected by being a prodigy?,1382486400,,194,4.216216216216216
3027733,5,B000YDVZ5W,Ethan is a child prodigy.  My music students are so excited about seeing his DVD's  I would recommend any of his products to anyone.,1363737600,,132,4.458333333333333
3027734,5,B000YDVZ5W,My wife and I watched this many times and never tire of the little genius.  He can always bring a smile to our lives and brighten our days.,1359072000,,139,3.9642857142857144

3027736,5,B000YDVZ5W,I was so please to have this arrive in time for Christmas considering how late I ordered it.  This is what I expected and this is what the seller gave to me... great service!  This prodigy is phenomenal.  Very much worth the buy.,1232323200,,229,4.27906976744186
3027737,4,B000YDVZ5W,"The zookeeper is not necessary. Ethan has more stage presence than the zookeeper. Jay Leno would have been a better fit. I realize that Ethan is very fond of animals as are all children. Having said that, and keeping in mind that Ethan is only six years old, Ethan's piano skills are truly incredible. This is truly a delightful DVD. I hope he maintains his interest as he gets older.",1229644800,,384,4.5
3027738,5,B000YDVZ5W,"I think only the crustiest hearted person would fail to find Ethan delightful. His talent is incredible, and his personality is instantly engaging, as many of us discovered during his two appearances on Jay Leno. To witness him switching instantly from a 'little kid' sitting down at the piano to the pro he truly is, to see his concentration and absolute lack of self-consciousness as his little fingers fly nimbly over the keyboard, and to hear the solid tones and the perfect timing that emerge from the hands of a six-year old, is to be constantly astounded. I couldn't recommend this DVD more highly. Take a vacation from the awful stuff on TV nowadays . . . he truly is like a breath of fresh air!",1210982400,6,703,4.587301587301587

3027740,3,B000YDVZ5W,"""Who is Ethan Bortnick you may ask? Ethan Bortnick was born December 24, 2000. He started reading at the age of two and speaks Russian and English. At age four he began studying with Mila Vaserstein. I first saw him on the Jay Leno Show and was quite impressed. I mean he couldn't even reach the pedals from the piano.""

Look at the last name of the previous reviewer: ""Vaserstein."" What an amazing coincidence that the glowing review was written by someone with the same last name as this kid's teacher!",1196121600,,504,4.538461538461538
