I wouldn't recommend this collection, but since I paid around $1.00 for it, I can't complain!",1450310400,2,253,5.146341463414634

8092961,5,B000BUNE3Y,"The 6 Movies in this collection are great! My eyes were wide open while watching the majority of these movies. I only fell asleep while watching ""Swing High, Swing Low (1937,92 Minutes). This movies I did not find as interesting, however; I will watch it again and I hope I won't fall asleep next time. What that movie did not have the others made up for 10 fold!
I did not notice that I had previously watch another movie besides, ""Home Town Story"", which was ""My Man Godfrey"". I saw ""My Man Godfrey"" on T.V. a while ago and I loved it when I watched it. I was so surprised that I now own it and can watch this wonderful movie any time I like now! This by far was the best movie in my opinion. I did enjoy watching, ""Home Town Story"", ""Storm In A Teacup"", ""Sidewalks of London"", and ""Of Human Bondage"". For the price and the many hours of enjoyment this collection provides, I felt was very well worth it. I have included a overview of the backs of the DVD's contained in the boxed set, that explains briefly about each movie. I hope this will help in your decision to purchase this DVD Collection. I am a old movie classics fan, no matter where I get to watch the Wonderful movies.
