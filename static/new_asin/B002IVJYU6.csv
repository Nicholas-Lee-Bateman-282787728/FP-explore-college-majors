The first film produced once Howard Hughes took the reins at RKO is a real winner. Based on a true incident, Richard O. Fleischer's gripping melodrama is every bit as good as his most lauded effort from this period, The Narrow Margin. Perry Mason's Della Street, Barbara Hale, is quite terrific alongside Bill Williams in a Carl Foreman story about an incident in which a returning US soldier recognized his brutal former captor back home in the City of Angels. Fleischer's genius for crafting lean and tense crime melodramas from small to medium size budgets with less heralded stars while at RKO is in evidence here. This one can stand proudly with films such as Follow Me Quietly and The Narrow Margin.

When James Fletcher (Bill Williams) wakes up at a Naval Hospital with no memory of how he got there, his confusion and panic is further heightened when he overhears a nurse accusing him of treason. When an old Navy buddy, now blind, wants to get rid of him himself, he breaks out and takes it on the lam to clear his name, knowing he's no traitor. Martha Gregory (Barbara Hale) doesn't believe him, however, and puts up a fight when he comes asking questions. The wife of Mark, who James is accused of selling out to the enemy while they were interned together and brutalized at a Japanese prisoner of war camp, she tries to turn him in. Forcing her to drive him from San Diego to Los Angeles to meet up with his other old pal, Ted (Richard Quine), who was captured with them, developments along the way change her mind.

What sways her in James' direction is an attempt to run them off the road by someone out to get rid of him, and none too picky about who they take out with him. When he falls asleep at the wheel the torture scars on his chest seal the deal for her, and the two work feverishly together to discover the truth. Fine pacing and some good atmosphere created through shots on the beach and a restaurant in Los Angeles' Chinatown called The White Lotus make everything convincing and entertaining. Following the trail of the prison guard called the Weasel he recognizes while they are having dinner, only Martha and Ted believes him to be innocent. A thrilling chase through the streets of 1940's Los Angeles on foot takes place at one point when a trap is set.

Just as in The Narrow Margin, a tense ending takes place on a train when Martha gets Naval Intelligence to believe her story and the race is on to get to James before he's made his last stop. A revelation and a twist punctuate this enjoyable story with a hint of romance in the offing for James and Martha. Marya Marco stands out in a brief supporting role as the wife of a Japanese soldier who hides James from bad guy Richard Loo. Frank Wilcox, Frank Fenton, and Martha Hyer round out a good cast in this fine first effort marking the new Hughes era at RKO. This particular offering is a region two DVD. Another excellent film from director Fleischer and a must see for fans of taught crime films.",1274054400,4,3063,4.482078853046595
