7758978,5,B01G919OWI,"The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About Halloween is a wonderful Halloween movie for children.  The theme is about facing your fears because they are not as big as you think. That is what is interesting about the film.

The storyline is about two kids named Nick and Sally who need to find the perfect Halloween costume. They find the Cat in the Hat and he tells them about a closet that has all the best costumes. They go on the hunt for the perfect costume and face their fears on the way.
The characters are very unique, creative and beautifully animated.  Some of them are astonishing. I love the wacky and crazy lady who owns all the costumes. Shes very helpful to the kids as she helps them find the perfect costume. I love how she dances with the Cat in the Hat. She is a fun, energetic, loving character that children will love. The Fish that follows The Cat in the Hat on his journeys is also hilarious! I love how he tries to scare The Cat in the Hat but he is so oblivious about his fear of pumpkins.

The animation is close to the Cat in the Hat books. The storyline is identical to the books, which doesnt always happen when you make a book into a movie. There are some movies that do not look anything like the original book.  The voice acting is applaud-able. I love how Martin Shorts  (The Cat in the Hat) voice is exactly how I imagine the Cat in the Hat would sound. I love how he sounds whimsical and kooky. I also adore the voice actors of Sally and Nick. I love how they make their voices so perfectly childlike.

The message of this film is to get over your fears because they are not as big as you think. It teaches kids that you can get over your fear whether its a small fear of ghosts or a big fear like stage fright.  All of the main characters get over fears that they couldn't get over before. The Cat in the Hat gives great advice - the fears you have are not bigger than you think. This is a great lesson for kids that have fears that they cannot get over. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 5 to 9.

8762541,2,B01G919OWI,"Very disappointing to put it mildly.  If the Cat in the Hat knows a lot about Halloween he's not telling, as this nearly hour-long program spends less than 5 minutes on the topic. The mood is about as far from Halloween as you can get - sunny skies, bright colors, and upbeat singalongs abound and there is nothing remotely scary or spooky to be seen.

Dr. Seuss made it a point never to talk down to his audience, but this program certainly does. It has been sanitized for 3-year-olds. This Cat is not the rambunctious and mischievous (if good-hearted) troublemaker of old, but rather a safe, moral-teaching Barney type. The kids are depicted more as real little kids - easily alarmed or excited - than the precocious, adventurous types common in family entertainment.  Perhaps these characters are more realistic, but they certainly aren't interesting to watch.

On the positive side, Martin Short does a terrific job voicing the Cat - full of energy, charisma, and general wackiness.  It's a shame he isn't given much material to work with. Another bright spot is the art design, which is appropriately Seussian, even if it has nothing to do with Halloween.

In short, give this one a pass unless you actually have a 3-year-old.  And then quickly move him/her on to the classic Cat in the Hat/Dr. Seuss material. Though far from perfect, the 1977 TV special ""Halloween is Grinch Night"" does a much better job of evoking the spookiness of Halloween, and the lead child character is more heroic and relatable to an elementary school age audience.",1509235200,,1547,4.815094339622641
