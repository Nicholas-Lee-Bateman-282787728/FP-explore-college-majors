6881717,1,B00QU7SQ2G,"This show is AMAZING.  FIVE STARS for the show, the cast, the entire thing.

ONE star for the fact that the DVD will be unusable and is an insult to the viewers.
 I will NOT be buying the DVD unless a *REAL* production is released. Not one that has all 10 episodes on a single disc, which means the video quality will be absolute *cr*p*",1420588800,15,336,4.138461538461539
6881718,3,B00QU7SQ2G,"I really wanted to write an unbiased review of Gracepoint since I am such a big fan of Broadchurch. Seeing Broadchurch previously, it was impossible not to compare it to Gracepoint. I thought the acting was a bit better in Broadchurch, with the exception of Tennant, who in my opinion, is amazing in everything he does. I thought it was a bit strange to hear him speak with an American accent.

That said, I think Gracepoint took an identity of its own towards the middle of the series and began to drift away from the plot line of Broadchurch. I thought it was quite good, and I thought the actress that played Miller did a great job. The show is full of raw emotion and keeps you guessing until the very end. I highly recommend it for mystery murder fans.",1419552000,35,757,4.4071428571428575
6881719,5,B00QU7SQ2G,"I've been a total Broadchurch nerd since it first aired and it actually made my viewing of Gracepoint a richer experience. Some Broadchurch fans choose to not leave the Broadchurch baggage where it belongs -- in Broadchurch. Because it ended the way it did and had different plot points as well as the characters having different personalities from their counterparts in Broadchurch and the overall more gritty and darker tone I can honestly say that Gracepoint can and  should be seen as its own thing. I love how the ending of this echoed all the way back to episode one and cause of death, changing the subtext, theme and denouement entirely from the source material. I now see Broadchurch and Gracepoint as two different shows. Gracepoint is more a sibling show than a remake. With a French remake now in progress I think it's safe to say that this story has gone beyond being a story and is now a universe of its own which is big enough to support both Broadchurch and Gracepont. Worthy of note: Tennant began voice coaching while still performing Richard II daily. He began work on Gracepoint literally just days from his final performance in that play. How he simply transforms is a joy all by itself. His ability to simply *become* has been solidly proved elsewhere --- here, too now! (I have to admit I'm ridiculously happy he's had a show set in my country). Given the personalities of Richard II then taking on shooting for Gracepoint. to just around 3 days off  Tennant and Gunn had a kind of magic between them, and I also quite enjoyed Jackie Weaver's character. Nolte reminded me why I've always been a fan of his. I was very impressed with the quality of work done by the younger actors as well. We don't often get work of this quality here in the States. Gracepoint didn't pay service to other crime dramas made here. We didn't have anyone wearing the hero's white hat. They were beautifully flawed and multi-faceted characters. Shakespeare understood that by not judging your characters  a writer can turn in a wonderfully human story, and the writers of Gracepoint obviously know it too. The moral and ethical ambiguity of Gracepoint's characters makes this a story rich with humanity. I will be purchasing Gracepoint, however,not from the US. Burn on demand paired with all 10 episodes being on one disk will effect the quality of the disk, so I am forced to purchase the box set from Canada  where the episodes like that of Broadchurch are not burn on demand comes as a 3 disk box set and is available in Blu-ray as well. I have heard it will have extras on it. Soon I will be a proud owner of the Gracepoint box set, which means it will sit right next my Broadchurch box set.",1419292800,61,2697,4.6125
6881720,5,B00QU7SQ2G,"Saw this first before the original British version 'Broadchurch'. So with no bias, I though it was a very good series with great acting from all involved. What makes it different from most American shows is that there is no happy ending. Each reveal within the mystery, each step and discovery is another descent down towards the true discovery of loss. Each of these characters is dealing with loss, we are seeing them at different stages and timelines, and it's a reality that there are no answers sometimes on how to deal with things, no pat answers.

I just finished watching the British version and I think the remake held up very well compared to the original. The american version had a little different pacing in the speech patterns, lines were said for emphasis, which I would have missed in the British version (maybe it's to hit us American's over the head with the obvious!) but I think all involved in the American version can hold their heads up with pride. They did an excellent job here. Watch it before the British version, you won't be missing anything, and with the additional 2 episodes they added in a few additional things that fleshed out some characters.",1419206400,62,1178,4.718446601941747

6881723,5,B00QU7SQ2G,"By Greg- It was fascinating to see this series after seeing the British version ""Broadchurch.""  There are times when the camera shots appear to be frame-by-frame recreations of the original.

David Tennant is top shelf, as always.  He is surrounded by gifted actors who keep the series at the highest level.

The most glaring difference between the two is the fact that ""Broadchurch"" has a second season, but ""Gracepoint"" does not.  Having said that, ""Gracepoint"" does not need a second season.  It is that good!",1486252800,3,512,4.964705882352941

6881737,1,B00QU7SQ2G,"1. Borrowed (stolen?) non-creative script from European story with same plot (and everything else) structure. Differences between the two are trivial.
2. Predictable and robotic acting and cast stereotyping. Over-the-top acting out behavior with obvious background music to lend support all in an endeavor to create drama - seems contrived, artificial.
3. A writer's made-up and sterile and cleansed small town setting. No dust on anything; indicative of the artificiality of the series.
4. An indicator of cheapness in this made-for-TV daytime soap feel is a lack of subtitling for those hard of hearing or for those who think dialogue actually means something.

6881749,3,B00QU7SQ2G,"I really wanted to like this show. The acting is very good and production is very well done. In fact, the scene when the family reacts to the boy's death had me really shocked at how realistic it played out (I was thinking, yeah I'd probably react that way too). The major issue I had with the show is that the whole ""everyone's a suspect"" theme is really shoved down your throat. I mean, really? Would people really act like that in real life (i.e. looking suspiciously at the closing of every scene or just act guilty in general, I mean, everyone? come on...)? Maybe I wasn't patient enough, but I seriously only made it about 4 or 5 episodes before I just threw my hands up in the air. Don't get me wrong, the plot line had a lot of potential and there are no issues with the general feel and production of the series, but I can only take so many innocent people acting guilty until I give up. Maybe you have more patience than I...",1442966400,,935,4.258426966292135
6881750,4,B00QU7SQ2G,"Watchable crime drama based on the original British series. The leading player, from the original, seemed to me to be overdoing it, with the rest of the cast  varying from quite good to adequate. How it plays if one sees it one episode a week, I cannot say, but watched over several days, it did drag  some. Overall, however, it hold one's attention and builds sympathy for the affected parties. Nick Nolte, incidentally, is quite effective as an old man  caught up in the hysteria of the killing of a young boy which is the crime upon which the film centers and Anna Gunn as the female lead more than justifies her reputation as a ""class act"".",1442275200,,644,4.487179487179487
6881751,3,B00QU7SQ2G,"When Fox announced they were remaking Broadchurch I thought to myself ""Why? That seems like a strange thing to do."" and I had no desire to see this thing until they said Tennant would be playing the US version of DI Alec Hardy. I'll watch just about anything with David Tennant and find something nice to say about it while remaining fairly objective. Gracepoint has a decent cast, it was filmed in a lovely location, the score was nice, Tennant looks good despite strange things they did to his hair in a few episodes, I appreciated the ""different than Broadchurch"" ending. Gracepoint wasn't unwatchable and it sure as hell was better than it's lead in ""Bones"". Those are the nicest things I have to say about the show.
I think Fox must have had the feeling it would flop. In addition to a lack advertising they put it against very popular shows on CBS and ABC in a timeslot Fox has never dominated. Yes, the accent Tennant used was strange for viewers familiar his UK work but I got used to it. Gracepoint remains very similar to Broadchurch throughout most of it's run but manages to drag on for 2 more episodes. I wasn't enthralled with season 1 of Broadchurch but it was never boring. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Gracepoint. It's well acted but rather dull. You can get away with skipping after episode three up to episode nine and still know what's up and still be able to appreciate the ending. That's not exactly a good thing for a serial/mystery series.
The DVD set isn't particularly special. It is burned to three discs with minimal special features. I'll never understand why Fox felt the need to produce an uninspired copy of a hit British program. I'd really only recommend this to die hard fans of David Tennant. Broadchurch is definitely superior, Tennant gets to speak normally and Olivia Colman is absolutely brilliant. Not to mention Broadchurch will have at least three seasons.",1433116800,4,1912,4.693452380952381

6881760,3,B00QU7SQ2G,Only watched this because of David Tennant who was sublime. Incidentally his American accent was fine despite what the critics said.  The rest of the cast were not believable and Anna Gunn was abysmal.  I am not a huge fan of Olivia Colman but her Ellie Miller was a million times more superior than Gunn's.  There was absolutely no chemistry between DT and Gunn and she seemed to be in some sort of trance the whole way through.  Then the ending was changed with a different killer revealed...it was left fairly open at the end ready for season two but the Americans obviously lack the subtlety to appreciate this.

The rest of the cast were great, not to mention how beautiful they are.

6881770,5,B00QU7SQ2G,"This mini-series was intricately well-laid-out, dark, disturbing, balefully moody, gripping, filled with plot twists, surprises, shock and irony right up until the very end.

People whom you reflexively think to be guilty, even root for to be guilty, turn out to be completely innocent. Tragically and horrifyingly, a man who was actually innocent of the murder, takes his own life because a secret from his past is exposed, one that makes him look reflexively guilty -- but, he wasn't guilty. He was innocent - but he kills himself, because his reputation, and chances of being able to continue living a normal life in this town full of hidden secrets, are destroyed by an over-eager, overly-aggressive reporter.

People whom you reflexively think to be innocent, turn out to be dangerously close to being guilty -- then, the plot twists again and you find that they aren't the killer. The person you would most offhandedly, dismissively conclude to be wholesome and innocent, turns out to be the guilty party, cloaking a dark secret -- and even then, it turns out, he wasn't even the actual killer~!!

The lead detective is concealing a ruinous episode in his past, one that also involved a murder - but the truth of what actually happened is even more grotesquely sad.

The squeaky-clean town priest, it turns out, had a violent episode in his own past, plus substance abuse issues.

Even, or more appropriately, ""especially"", the family of the murdered boy, has secrets -- ones that cut to the heart of what really happened and which threaten to tear the family apart. The father of the dead boy has a secret relationship with a chirpy British innkeeper in town. His wife, the dead boy's mother, had a previous relationship with the man who became the town priest - but that relationship is over. Or is it? The dead boy's sister has a secret relationship with a boyfriend she'd rather her parents not know about, she's not as perfectly virginal as she'd like her parents to ""assume"", and she's had involvement with drugs. Even the dead boy himself turns out to be not so innocent after all. At one point the dead boy's mother, agonized, lets out an outburst that ""I don't even know my own family"".

But that's the slowly-dawning, grim realization which makes this so riveting a mini-series to watch -- virtually everyone in this tight-lipped, creepily too-friendly-and-""normal"" small California town is guilty of SOMETHING - infidelities, secrets, secret relationships, events or tragedies in their pasts which they'd rather not talk about or admit. EVERYONE has a secret. EVERYONE is hiding something. NO ONE is who or what they seem. EVERYONE has the potential to be a suspect, and nearly EVERYONE is at some point -- sometimes with tragic results.

I watched nearly every episode when it aired - and those episodes I couldn't watch when they aired, I purchased on Amazon Prime so I wouldn't miss what happened. In fact, I bought all the episodes while waiting for the DVD to finally become available.

Most of the people who seem to have a ""problem"" with the show, seem to ONLY have a ""problem"" with it because they seem to think that it is a copy of some other show that aired in Britain. But I never saw that other show in the first place and have nothing to compare it to, so I rate this show based on its own merits -- which is what others should be doing as well.",1425254400,11,3375,4.747440273037543
