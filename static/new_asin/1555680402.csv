7795864,5,1555680402,This is a powerful video that teaches to children and adults the importance of love and forgiveness. It also is excellent at teaching how to distinguish between the flesh vs the Spirit. I plan to show it during Wednesday night Kid's Club at my church as a culmination of studying the book of Romans. Thank you for this wonderful and moving Christian movie for children.,1432512000,,369,4.6923076923076925
