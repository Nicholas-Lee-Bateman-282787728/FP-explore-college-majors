8072790,2,B000A2WQU0,"Okay, you ever see those DiC cartoons from the early 2000s? You know, the ones that feel like a cartoon from the 80's, yet was somehow current? Hammerboy is sort of the Dragon Ball knock off equivalent to that. The story revolves around a boy named Mangchi, who is given a hammer on his birthday by his grandfather. They live with a small community, that live on big buildings that are flooded.....I think. It seems to give off a post-apocalyptic vibe, but the movie never goes any further with that, so what's the point? Anyhoo, one night, Mangchi finds a girl flying in a craft, being chased by soldiers. He stops the soldiers attacking her, and she lands in the community. It turns out the girl is a princess named Poplar, and she's trying to stop a kingdom led by the evil monarch Moonk, who seems to have certain powers. Naturally, Mangchi is asked to help, and is part of a big destiny.

That is essentially the story of Hammerboy. What is there to say about it? Well, a few things. On the surface, it SEEMS like a Dragon Ball cash-in, mixed in with a film trying to capitalize on Disney films from the 90s. And that's really what the movie is, a dumb, if somewhat harmless, kids film, that tries to be like one of the biggest mangas around. However, certain......oddities stick out. The animation, at best, looks like it came from a DiC cartoon from the 2000s. It's competent, and there isn't many mistakes, and yet, it's very restricted in terms of animation. All the characters feel rather lifeless in their movement. Backgrounds, nothing to write home about. Very generic designs, though well painted at least. Voice acting-wise..........well, I can't speak for the original Korean, but the dub SUCKS. Aside from Veronica Taylor as Mangchi, and Dan Green as the villain, Moonk (and even then they seem to be phoning it in), everyone sounds awful, and turn in dreadful performances. To be fair, the story is rather underwhelming in the first place, so I guess it makes sense. It's basically a standard good-vs.-evil type of story, and every single character falls under a trope. The main hero, the beautiful princess, the bad guy, the other bad guy, the comic relief, the character who works with the bad guys but has a change of heart. Chances are you've seen these before. It's not like this is always a bad thing, but when the plot is not that engaging, it drags it down even further. As a result, the way I found myself going through the film are some WEIRD scenes. For example, shortly after Mangchi leaves his community to help out Poplar, a girl named Angdu is mad that Mangchi had to leave. She shows off her anger by.......throwing goats into the water...........um...what? I know there are certain ways to release anger, but that's a new one. There's also a scene where Poplar, after getting kidnapped by some criminals, is put on sale by said criminals. Yes, slave sales. Feel free to pull your collar there. Overall, the movie is boring, but has a ton of weird stuff.

In terms of the DVD, there's really not much to it. All it contains are the U.S. and Korean trailers for the movie, an art gallery, a music video (containing Generic Pop Ballad In Kids Movie #82903631), and previews for other titles. Not even a 5-minute behind the scenes clip? For shame! Also, this one's just something I noticed, but I HATE the thing that's supposed to hold the disk in the case. Oh, I don't mean in general, I mean in this one DVD in particular. It may just be my copy, or the way I try to put it back in, but for some reason, the disk would chip at certain edges. I don't know if it would damage the disk, but it does worry me. Overall, I didn't enjoy this one. Fortunately, I picked it up at a flea market for $2, which actually isn't too bad a price. If you DO have a few dollars to spare, and don't mind a number of problems, this might be for you. Personally, I say skip it. There's much, MUCH better out there.
