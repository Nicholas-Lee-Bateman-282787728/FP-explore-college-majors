5168085,5,B008IG0FEY,"I don't know much about studying the universe, especially wormhole's! They have been mentioned over the years but watching this video sure sheds light on what they all about. I couldn't think of a better person to explain what science has come up with than a famous actor. Check it out.you will learn and be impressed. Morgan Freemen will impress you.",1350345600,,351,4.770491803278689
5168086,5,B008IG0FEY,I like all Though the Wormhole CD's. Their is a lot on good information. I have watched around 5 or more I have learned something form each one.,1349481600,,144,4.178571428571429
5168087,5,B008IG0FEY,Sci Fi meets reality in this inquisitive series that answers the true geek's what-if questions with pragmatism and enthusiasm.  Even if somewhat embellished the show is great fun.  My one complaint : it isn't long enough.,1349481600,17,221,5.111111111111111
5168088,5,B008IG0FEY,"Love the whole series, and Morgan Freeman is the perfect host! Good way to stretch your brain power, but in fun-sized bites!",1348444800,,124,4.681818181818182
5168089,4,B008IG0FEY,"Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same.  Starting with Morgan Freeman stating ""when I was a young boy..."" then something he did to get in trouble, or something he witnessed that ruined his fragile eggshell mind.  Followed by rhetorical questions and theories, and tons and tons of examples.  The examples even have examples.  Maybe I just understand this stuff and the show really dumbs it down, but I feel like I wasted money investing in season 3.  Which by the way, although not currently available, (I don't have cable and I still had the privilege of watching this before the DVD came out) but I will still probably end up buying it on DVD which is cheaper than I already paid for the electronic proprietary/DRM version on Amazon Unbox.",1347148800,,784,4.693430656934306
5168090,5,B008IG0FEY,"The complete series is well worth your time.  Interesting, insightful and thought provoking while informative.  Uses scientific results as a basis not hearsay or common religious backdrop.",1347062400,8,188,5.925925925925926
5168091,5,B008IG0FEY,"Science and technology have had a major impact on society, and their impact is growing. By drastically changing our means of communication, the way we work, our housing, clothes, and food, our methods of transportation, and, indeed, even the length and quality of life itself, science has generated changes in the moral values and basic philosophies of mankind.
Beginning with the plow, science has changed how we live and what we believe. By making life easier, science has given man the chance to pursue societal concerns such as ethics, aesthetics, education, and justice; to create cultures; and to improve human conditions. But it has also placed us in the unique position of being able to destroy ourselves.

5168122,5,B008IG0FEY,"Though the Wormhole is a really interesting series.  Each episode keeps you entertained as well as informed.  I'd rate this series up there with Cosmos by Carl Sagan (the original series, not the new one) as one of the top science shows of all time.  Well documented with lots of good animation to keep one entertained/interested.  Even some of the subjects you thought were obvious/boring (might have even skipped over) are worth watching as they present the subject matter very well.  Just an overall great series in general.",1431561600,,527,4.943181818181818

These shows really make you think, and sometimes question things that once seemed so self-evident that most people don't really think about them.  There is nothing else quite like this series.",1417478400,,362,5.11864406779661

5168154,2,B008IG0FEY,"""Through the Wormhole"" season three was the weakest so far, suffering from the same jerky editing as the previous seasons but with even more speculation and less real information than before. Disappointing.",1408060800,2,206,5.46875
5168155,5,B008IG0FEY,"Certainly one of the best.  I loaned my DVD's to my son and daughter and that is the last I have seen of them.  So I now I am buying as second set of all the seasons as I have watched some of my favorite episodes two and three times.  If history be the judge, the Wormhole will  become classics.  Two of my friends love the programs.  I would give Season 3 6 Stars.

Do I understand everything presented?  No.  Episode 5, ""What is Nothing"" I have watched several times and still can't get my head around it.  And instead of being dismayed, I'm thrilled.  Because finally someone is countering the dumbing of America.",1406678400,2,616,4.315789473684211
5168156,5,B008IG0FEY,"Through the wormhole is a very informative and interesting series.  Definitely science based and mind blowing.  They never answer the questions posed directly.  They show varied opinions from premier scientists.

If you enjoy science and love exploring ideas.  This is the series for you.",1405555200,,288,5.454545454545454

5168159,5,B008IG0FEY,"I'm not sure just how much Morgan Freeman really knows or cares about the subjects in this series.  However, he hooks you into not only understanding but also discussing them!  You don't have to have a PHD or deep scientific interest to be entertained and educated at the same time with this series; and Season 3 doesn't disappoint in either category.  I recommend this to anyone with a curious mind.",1403395200,,400,4.685714285714286
5168160,5,B008IG0FEY,"Amazing show, I love watching it! It's always interesting to watch. I learn things that I may never use else where other than conversation, but who knows maybe I'll be an mad scientist some day",1402876800,,193,4.542857142857143

5168163,5,B008IG0FEY,"Great questions and interviews with scientists about questions that really have no answers yet, but finally science is not afraid to ask.  I am glad there are scientists valiant enough to pursue the really difficult questions, knowing full well that they might not have the answers in their own lifetime.",1396828800,,304,5.08

5168175,5,B008IG0FEY,"I previously purchased Seasons 1 & 2 of this tv series. I have really enjoyed this
series on tv. And Morgan Freeman covers subjects which are on the edge of
science. And he has scientists and researchers who are on the cutting
edge of science. I will most likely purchase season 4 of this series soon.
Actually I have not seen all of the episodes on tv so this will cover the
episodes that I had not seen.",1385683200,,405,4.205128205128205
5168176,5,B008IG0FEY,Best show ever. Why are we here? This gives you many things to ponder! I keep it all on the DVR until the DVD comes out.,1383868800,,120,3.6538461538461537
5168177,5,B008IG0FEY,This one picked up right where season 2 left off.  They bring in some fringe ideas and mix it with revolutionary thinking.  One of my favorite shows.,1383350400,,149,4.481481481481482
5168178,5,B008IG0FEY,"Excellent! While mankind deals with current affairs of the day, this  video goes much father to more serious questions....existence!

5168180,5,B008IG0FEY,"Not being a cable subscriber, I had not heard of these until my wife purchased a couple of seasons for me as a gift. I am addicted as these are very interesting.

I have seen glimpses of different types of some of this deep science in the news from time to time, but most of these people stay out of the media. This show takes it further into the deep science while making it accessible to those of us who are not scientists.

My only complaint is the titles; they are bad and sometimes off-putting. I would recommend they be ignored because they only tie together the episode information in only a loose way.",1381449600,,609,4.333333333333333
5168181,4,B008IG0FEY,"Science with Morgan Freeman just made everything better. The series is nice and doesn't go too complex to throw the viewer any weird curveballs, but for those not too keen with the sciences, some things (even with the nice animations and analogies) may not have been described in the best way, but again it was something simplified.",1380067200,,332,4.842105263157895
5168182,5,B008IG0FEY,"Before I started watching Morgan Freeman in this video series, I was a very conservative right-wing religious fanatic.  Because of this video, I started the process of utilizing my neo-cortex and began performing critical thinking.  This has changed my entire outlook in life.  If you can't imagine changing your thinking paradigm, it's probably better if you just don't bother with this product.  However, if you'd like to be aware of some of the most advanced thinking and solutions being attempted to life's biggest questions then I'd recommend that you also buy a thinking cap, a strap-down lounge chair with beverage dispenser and get ready for your mind to be expanded.",1379635200,,675,5.109090909090909
5168183,5,B008IG0FEY,Like the previous DVDs by Morgan Freeman the presentation and content are thought provoking. Mr. Freeman presents the latest theories in the scientific domain. This is the third season and is just as wonderful as the first two. My grandaughter saw some of the episodes and she wanted them for her birthday. She was delighted with the entire series. If you like science and your point of view challenged by new ideas then you will love this series. I highly recommend the entire series.,1378771200,,485,4.785714285714286
5168184,5,B008IG0FEY,Everyone knows Morgan Freeman has one of the best voices in hollywood - so I would guess this would be a perfect fit - using his celebrity to discuss such important topics and ideas hopefully entices other non-science people to watch...,1378512000,,236,4.780487804878049
5168185,5,B008IG0FEY,"Of all the science programs, this one is the most interesting I have watched. Morgan Freeman is great is the host and the information covered in the programs is simply excellent. I am comparing this program with The Universe and How the Earth Was Made, both good programs.

5168186,5,B008IG0FEY,I was happy to discover that there were three seasons and I believe a fourth in the works. Mr Freeman makes these topics come alive and the producers stick to solid science subjects on the edges of knowledge. Looking forward to more. My only disappointment is there simply is not as many episodes as I would like.,1378080000,,313,4.508771929824562

5168189,5,B008IG0FEY,"This is a really interesting and intellectually provocative series. I have used different episodes as themes or topics for my Sunday morning youth group. The sessions always generate a lot of deep and sometimes very lively discussion - most notably the episode entitled, ""Did We Invent God?""

5168199,5,B008IG0FEY,Morgan does a terrific job taking a very challenging subject matter and makes it easy to understand.  Lots of wonderful graphics which help so much to grasp the information.  I've seen all his movies in the series and my hope is everyone watches them to learn more about our universe.,1370908800,,284,4.66
5168200,5,B008IG0FEY,"Morgan Freeman seems genuinely interested in the subjects covered here.  He's the perfect ""host"" for this sort of intelligent television.  Hard to pick a favorite from Seasons 1, 2 and 3.  They are all stellar.",1369612800,,210,4.942857142857143
5168201,5,B008IG0FEY,This series is one for the best I've seen so far in covering the many topics of science and physics. I would recommend this to anyone interested in documentary's or science. I really like how Morgan Freeman starts each show with how the topic being covered relates to him as child. It puts the nature of the show in perspective for me and how it relates to the real world.,1369094400,,372,4.328571428571428

5168205,5,B008IG0FEY,"Here is what this show is about:

-The most shocking cutting edge science.
-The questions about life, the universe, and everything, that we all wonder about, but nobody really asks.
-Who we are.  This is a huge subject with so many different aspects, the show could go on forever.

Combine these three things, and you will watch these shows over and over and wonder and awe at the beauty of science and the universe and all of us!  I can't get enough of this show.",1367712000,,464,4.423529411764706

5168208,5,B008IG0FEY,"The show or in this case the episode I purchase it was of interest to me to maximize my mental capabilities and bring it to a different level. The vehicle I used to obtain it was remarkable! The software and capability in which Amazon executed my need was amazing.  It took less than a minute for me to have and view what I wanted at that time.  I highly recommend it.

In other words I can get certain ""Parts"" of the series for free and the newer ones I have to pay for- on Amazon. But on Netflix, though it is also a pay service, I don't have to pay extra to view it.",1365984000,,309,3.9047619047619047

5168213,5,B008IG0FEY,I also have season one (but not 2 - yet). I just LOVE the way this show takes ultra complicated topics - and boils them down to a level I can comprehend. Some intense topics. Mind blowing!! The episode 'What is Nothing?' - makes me think it should be the title of a Seinfeld episode. :) The final episode is the one that brought me down just a tad - 'Did we create God?' - To me a slight slant (I take) towards atheism. - Which doesn't brighten my day. I hope they keep having season after season. I love (most) of the contemplations!! A GREAT series!! Scott MacNeil,1363910400,,566,4.201834862385321

5168217,5,B008IG0FEY,"While Freeman takes a somewhat unconventional approach to scientific documentary, I appreciate that he lets the experts do the talking.  I have no idea how he books such distinguished guests and finds exactly the right person to make exactly the right point, but this show has greatly expanded my understanding of theoretical physics and our understanding of the universe and ourselves.

Also, you really can't beat the voice of Morgan Freeman explaining the secrets of the universe.",1362960000,,483,5.259740259740259
5168218,3,B008IG0FEY,"There problem with this series is that there is really nothing new being presented, and part of what is can be well-disputed.  It's really kind of a waste of Freeman's talent.",1362873600,3,175,4.645161290322581

5168228,4,B008IG0FEY,"I think Cosmos is the best science show ever made. It's got great music, Carl Sagan, and even though it's out of date, there's not much in it that's absurd or just plain wrong.

Morgan Freeman's show, on the other hand, is a little more daring. They use the world's worst animators and musicians and have a good mix of scientists and crackpots (""theoretical physicists""). Don't get me wrong, I'm all about hearing wild ideas like string theory and wormholes, but they tend to throw in people who present ideas that are more 'acid trip fantasy' than [even] 'pseudo-' science.

Still, the majority of it is science (theoretical or measurable) and it is entertaining, though there really isn't much new ground covered here that shows like Nova and the rest haven't been over thoroughly over the years. I hope in season 4 they do a bit more with the future of space travel and telescopy.",1356998400,8,883,4.690322580645161

So cutting edge that one of the episodes in this particular season is the front cover for Smithsonian January 2013!  By the way, Smithsonian's article isn't nearly as interesting as this DVD!

Knowing where to acquire important, often prophetic data in and about today's age is a necessity if we want to stay ahead of the curve.  This is just such a source.  I recommend it without hesitation - it just keeps proving itself!",1356307200,,590,4.85

5168237,5,B008IG0FEY,"Morgan Freeman has an authoritative voice, which makes you think he wrote the DVDs all by himself. But he probably got some help.
I first saw this series when I was in a nursing home after I drank too much wine and fell on the hardwood floor of my house. In the nursing home, every bed had a TV, and if you didn't turn up the volume on yours you would hear all the crap from the other TVs. When I found Morgan Freeman on the Science Channel,I got really mad when I couldn't hear what he was saying. As Jean-Paul Sartre once said: ""hell is other people"". So when I got home with my cat Monkey and only one TV and no wine, I started buying Through the Wormhole. You can watch it on the Science Channel, but you'll be bombarded with crappy commercials which are louder than Morgan Freeman. I have the first three seasons and they're all excellent. I'll get season four as soon as it comes out. Monkey likes Through the Wormhole. Try it, you'll like it.",1353542400,19,949,4.248618784530387

5168239,5,B008IG0FEY,"In contrast to most of the fluff on TV the Wormhole series is thought-provoking and enlightening in scientists' search for truth.
