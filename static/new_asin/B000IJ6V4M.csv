As a master instructor his dedication to the learner is reflected in the clarity of his presentation.  The instructions for each movement and ultimately creating your own form are clear and precise, which includes the quality of the camera angles.

Mr. Barr does not postpone the goal of experiencing ""Inner Peace"".  He says, ""This form is about relaxation, letting go of stress...balancing the energy system"".  From the first movement he makes it clear that how we direct our thoughts in the present moment will have an immediate and gentle effect on the flow of our energy (chi) throughout the body.  If you choose to live a less stressful, more balanced life, ""Movements for Inner Peace"" is an inspiring resource for accomplishing this.  Thank you, Richard Barr for skillfully sharing your expertise and talent.",1167177600,7,987,5.24203821656051

But still it has more to offer. You can reach an state of being here with yourself having your intention on the root, and then gradually reach an state of observer of yourself. From then I can easily meditate.

I like to play with exercises and now, one of his exercises are now incorporated to my daily routine of tai chi chuan.

...and that was the use of one of his exercises.

Buy it. It is really a 5 star product.",1163116800,5,542,4.084905660377358
