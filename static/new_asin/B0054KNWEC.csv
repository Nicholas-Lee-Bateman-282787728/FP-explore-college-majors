8456781,2,B0054KNWEC,"If you're just looking to get your hand held a bit and maybe look into the world of melodeons and concertinas a little, this is a swell video. If you have to actually replace or repair anything -- like, say, a reed valve or two, the most common repair on a melodeon -- forget it. This is not even an overview of the subject. There's some slightly useful information on concertinas in general, some slightly more useful information on the mechanics of altering a reed in order to affect the tuning (nothing at all on the actual tuning, of course), but that's it. Two stars is extremely generous here, I think.",1381708800,6,608,4.486486486486487
