8386638,1,B00316DB6U,"I am stunned that Danny DeVito allowed himself to be part of a total piece of trash entertainment. I got into it for about 25 minutes and threw it in the trash! I have no problem with language and sexual content, it is unfortunately part of movies these days but this disastrous attempt at entertainment was nothing but raw and vulgar, tasteless, lewd beyond reason. The story line was junk and the actors/ acting were totally rank amateur class. What a waste!",1425168000,,460,4.621951219512195

8386643,1,B00316DB6U,"LUCKILY WE BORROWED THE (MOVIE?) FROM A LIBRARY.  MY WIFE AND I TRIED TO WATCH IT WHILE WE KEPT CHANGING THE VOLUME IN ORDER TO NOT HURT OUT EARS.  WE KEPT BEING INSULTED BY OBSCENITY AND WHEN THAT LET UP IT WAS ALTERNATED WITH ABSURDITY.  WE DO LIKE DANNY BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE JUST SOLD HIS NAME FOR A QUICK BUCK.  WE TURNED IT OFF AFTER 15 MINUTES.  DANNY IF YOU READ THIS, GO TO A MEETING!
