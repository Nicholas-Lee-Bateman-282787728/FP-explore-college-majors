876159,3,6304451032,"I first heard of MARK OF THE DEVIL's notoriety when I was a teenager. It had this mythology along the lines of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT & I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  I couldn't find it anywhere though. Several years later I  was hired to write and direct PART 6 (!) and the company sent me the  original to view. While it didn't scare me, it definitely left some  unnerving tension. As a historical piece, I found it painfully fascinating.  If what the opening credits claim (This is all a true stroy), then it makes  it's effect that much more profound. As a horror movie, it's okay. Nothing  scary happens, though the blood and torture is what clearly lends it to the  genre.  You could watch worse, you could watch better.  It's a decent time  waster (plus it stars Udo Kier!) Good luck in trying to find any of the  sequels, though. Part 3 was retitled SISTERS OF SATAN, PART 4 is actually  TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD, Part 5 is actually RETURN OF THE BLIND - and yes,  there is a MARK OF THE DEVIL 666 - the only sequel since PART 2 to be  produced under the DEVIL banner!",964051200,22,1067,4.212871287128713
876160,1,6304451032,"I saw this one in a discount movie house some time after itsinitial release, so the barf bag promised in the ad was no longergiven out. An ominous circumstance, as it turned out.
The film--as I recall--was quite well done. Too well done, in fact. The story concerns a medieval witchhunter, a wretched old man who travels from town to town. At each stop, he attempts to seduce the local lovelies. If they resist, he accuses them of being witches and they are tortured until they confess, then burned to death.
Among other things, the tortures include poking a long needle through a freckle or birthmark (the mark of the devil) to see if the girl bleeds, thus proving her innocence.
Anyway, about halfway through the film, after seeing a number of these disturbingly realistic scenes, I felt my bile urging itself upward. I fought to maintain control. Then there came a scene where a girl's head was locked into some sort of cage that held her mouth wide open. The witchhunter tore out her tongue with tongs and held the disgusting, bloody thing before the camera. That was all I could take.  [...] And, yes, being a resilient teen, I went back to finish the movie. What, sit alone in the lobby with my buds inside?

It's based on the true stories of the witch burnings in Europe centuries ago. The film is sadistic, gory and a great horror movie, along the same lines of Vincent Prices ""Witchfinder General"". However, it's not the most horrifying film you'll see, no matter what it says. This is classic 1970's fare that finally received a great remaster.

At first you think might ask yourself how appalling can a drive-in film made as early as 1970 be? But don't be fooled, this 40+ year old movie is still brutal and shocking to this day. The scenes of graphic violence and torture are consistent throughout and show how horrible we as humans can be. I'm not going to give too much away but we do get two women burning at the stake and one getting her tongue ripped out with a medieval torture device. What's also shocking is how backwards their religious views were, believing they had to slaughter and torture for God. As a Christian myself, I found this revolting and upsetting at how corrupt people's views can be. Anyway, between the good acting and the audacious violence, this one is for the books, even to this day. Give it a watch and prepare to be thrown back to the drive-in days!

876272,3,6304451032,"Like the top member review on this film, I also saw it when it first ran, at a drive-in theater. I was 11 years old. Just to clear the air a bit, the film was rated R upon it's release. I believe the rating system came into play in the mid 60's. Back then some R rated films had posters that displayed the ""R"" within a diamond instead of the usual MPAA square. I believe this film had the rating within a diamond shape. Film ratings at the time, and on until the mid 70's were G, GP(instead of PG), R, and X. XXX was not an offical rating, but one that the pornographers came up with to illustrate how adult a film was going to be. The GP rating still had pretty much the same inset description but with some slight variances- ""Parental guidence suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children or pre-teens"". At the time this film was released it was considered one of the most brutal films ever made. Even by today's standards there are moments that would definately still earn it a hard R. Seeing the film again made it seem pretty much laughable. The voice overs are terrible, but it was kind of funny to see Udo Kier (Andy Warhol's Dracula & Andy Warhol's Frankenstein) with an american accent. In actuality he has a very thick german accent when he speaks english. There are a lot of very brutal torture sequences but much of reactions to pain the overdubbers did made the entire film seem almost like a comedy having seen it again. None the less the film does try to take it's self seriously and gives what I believe is a more realistic than one might think- look at just how severe the situation was when the religious hysteria got in full swing and the wicth trials were at their peak. Worth seeing as an ok horror movie, but as a piece of history it might be better to stick with something The Crucible.",1367625600,2,1822,4.330409356725146

I purchased a DVD from Cheezy Flicks (""Andy Warhol's Bad""), and I feel that I must warn anyone thinking of buying THIS edition of MotD:

I have no idea how Cheezy Flix is allowed to be in business. The DVD I bought (a mistake you only make ONCE) was nothing more than a rip of the only authentic source for that movie; the VHS tape. I already own the VHS. I could have transferred it to DVD (naturally, I have a DVD recorder) myself. The cover was terrible, the sound was awful, and the company? Well...they ripped me off. Now, I'm sure they're going to use that common refrain of bootleggers all over: ""It's in the public domain."" REALLY? ""Andy Warhol's Bad,"" starring Carroll Baker, Susan Tyrell, and Perry King (along with a fantastic cameo by Warhol favorite Brigid Berlin) directed by Warhol protege Jed Johnson is in the 'public domain""? I bet that would be of interest to the filmmakers and the REAL copyright holders. And anyway...Let's assume that that is true. Why, then, is it directly transferred from the out-of-print Embassy VHS?

All I'm saying is: I will NEVER buy another release from Cheezy Flicks (or CHEEZY, or whatever they're calling themselves now), and I have no idea why Amazon doesn't feel the need to protect its costumers from bootleggers.

Buy at your own risk.",1353110400,6,1426,4.624505928853755

I first saw this movie at the cinema back in 1970. It was cutting edge for the times. I remember barf bags being handed out at the popcorn counter for free. During the late sixties and earlier seventies violence and gore was in its infancy, in the cinema, at this level .This daring experiment is what gives it it's mystic that has been carried over to this day of modern FX. This movie rapidly became a ""cult"" icon. If you, like me, are a connoisseur then you will want to add this movie to your library as I have. I would like to see some producer out there dare to attempt to do a remake with modern technology. As one the Beatles once quipped on his 1ST solo LP ""That would be something"". Having been based on a time that was a turning point in mans grasp of religious zeal and fear of the bureaucratic hierarchy that the Church had on its people at that time makes it quite unique. Society itself was on the fringe and the outcome was inevitable. The message this movie makes cuts deep into the senses as we look through history to modern times and expose mans desire to rule by attrition. Think not of this movie as a B HORROR MOVIE but as a historical stamp on the tyranny that infected 18th century society. This is a solid 4 star movie and a triumph for European cinema.

876313,4,6304451032,"MARK OF THE DEVIL is the Exploitation genre's answer to Michael Reeve's WITCHFINDER GENERAL, pillaging its plot while injecting it with gratuitous violence and gore. The three intertwining storylines are supposedly based on true accounts of medieval men and women that were tried for witchcraft in the days of the Inquisition. Udo Kier stars as a charming young baron that attempts to instill reason and logic in to the church after falling in love with an innocent beauty that stands accused of consorting with the devil. Reggie Nalder plays the sadistic Albino opposite to Kier's baron, creating a dark and memorable villain as the film's scarred witchfinder. A variety of colorful set pieces and gorgeous locations light up the screen thanks to the superior cinematography by Ernest Kalinke, while Michael Armstrong's keen direction makes this a somber but credible period piece. Armstrong lays out the film's Grand Guignol spectacle through the use of several of the Inquisition's cruelest torture devices, hardly shying away from the gore as the accused endure the horrors of the rack, finger presses, branding irons, and even more unimaginable torments. MARK OF THE DEVIL is one of the most entertaining Euro shockers out of Germany in the early 70s, and is a benchmark for the exploitative Inquisition films that followed in the wake of WITCHFINDER GENERAL.

876314,4,6304451032,"Some people here say this movie is boring, with terrible acting, and
has lame ""horror-gorror"" effects.  I disagree strongly.  It's a really
cruel German exploitation flick about Austrian witchhunts around  1700,
that victimized thousands of innocent people, organized by the Church
and State for profit and perverted religious reasons.  Herbert Lom,
an actor outstanding in drama AND comedy, is Lord Cumberland, self-called
""Great Witchhunter.""  He especially hates beautiful, young women because their
sexiness mocks his crippling inadequacies as a man.

  Cumberland's wrath falls upon two attractive, unlucky young people.  One is a
young baron, without allies, whose late father's estate Cumberland wants to
grab for himself.  Another is a big-eyed novice nun accused of intercourse with
Satan, when in fact the poor girl was raped by the local Lord Bishop.  Cumberland
orders horrible tortures for each, to produce confessions, in scenes about as
graphic as called for in a horror movie.  The girl, despite the worst they do,
doesn't give up any names except the Lord Bishop, and the baron likewise won't
confess to ""possession by the devil, talking to the dead"" and other trumped-up
hypocritical nonsense.  Doomed, with few options, they show real courage.

  The incredibly handsome and sea-green eyed Udo Kier, OK in his first film role,
is another young baron who thinks Cumberland is a great, fearless fighter of evil.
When Udo falls for barmaid Vanessa, whom wonderfully ugly Reggie Nalder accuses of
witchcraft, he becomes trapped in an ethical dilemma.  She asks Udo, ""What if your
own mother was accused of witchcraft, what would you do?""  Udo's baron looks great
but isn't too bright.  Like Hamlet, his hesitation brings bad fortune.

  Yes, there are aspects to this movie that are laughable, particularly the gooey,
schlocky, anachronistic ""love melody,"" and the very wishy-washy local villagers
who are instantly aroused to revolt by tempestuous, well-built Vanessa.  Producer
Adrian Hoven took the part of an honest puppeteer, subjected to Chinese water torture,
maybe because he didn't know any actor who could spin his eyes as crazily.  Let me
mention for each beautiful young actress in ""Mark of the Devil,"" these is a really
grotesquely dog-ugly villain, in the pack of the despicable witch-hunters, who wants
to furiously ravish, torture, and roast her, in colorful close-ups.",1271203200,4,2400,5.321808510638298

Their property was often seized as well.  While sold as ""fiction,"" this movie accurately portrays historical events similar to those documented in Foxe's Book of Martyrs during the time of the Great Reformaton.

The story line has a lot of promise, though the hysteria of witches is poorly done. There is little characterization to lead to credibility that the people being tortured are actual witches. It is understood that most people tortured were not witches, yet without characterization, there was little compassion for those being tortured. Without empathy for the victims, this became a run of the mill gore flick, without much gore. The torture scenes, though not overly graphic by todays standards, are adequate, but nothing special. Even the hype of the ripped out tongue fails to have any lasting impact for me. The musical score was awful and not overly fitting for a torture movie.

To its credit however, the movie was fairly well acted, even though the dubbing was hideous. There is also a historical value to the film, as it tries to show the hysteria of witchcraft running rampant in a small town.

876339,2,6304451032,"Any student of horror has to look back on some so-called ""Giallo"" films of the 70's and just wonder..why?

In ""Mark Of The Devil"", for instance, WHY did we need to see an innocent woman's tongue ripped out by crazed and perverse ""witchfinders"" and then see her burned to death, unable to scream: WHY did we need to see Count Cumberland (played in a nearly perfect constipated, corrupt ""manly"" feverish fury by Herbert Lom) rape the mother of two children who are locked up in a cell because they were playing with puppets?  WHY did we need to see nails stuck up the a** of Baron Daume, played by some other tan Italian guy?  And WHY, oh why, would we have any interest in a romance between Udo Kier (playing a Byronic Thomas More, kind of) and some idiotic but very attractive Italian woman?

The answer is difficult but undeniable: the madness of natural breasts, gore, the constant mention of the Devil in some way, and the undeniable fact that historians who study some of the Inquisition's torture techniques are really no different from the people who watch nonsense like this: the curiosity about ultimate chaos under the guise of religious purity.

A more refined version of this interesting trashfest is ""Witchfinder General"" with Vincent Price.  That great but largely unnoticed horror star, Reggie Nalder (""Salem's Lot"", ""Zoltan"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"") is here in full glory as Albino, a demented and malicious witchfinder.

The dubbing of the actor's voices is REALLY bad, especially of the children, you can tell it is adult's voices trying to speak in little voices...I wanted to hear Udo's voice, he has a German accent, but they dubbed over that too...But it really was entertaining, and the fact that people used to burn ""witches"" and this could be close to a true story back in those days makes it even more interesting to me.

876345,3,6304451032,"""Mark Of The Devil"" came out in 1969, and was billed as ""Positively The Most Horrifying Movie Ever Made,"" and looking at the time of its release, I could agree. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" generally freaked people out in 1968, but the recently deceased getting back up, and cannibalizing the living really does stretch credibility, where this film focuses on the cavalier attitude of Witchfinders in 1700 Austria.

People were superstitious at the time, and doing these awful things to people, and calling it ""The Lord's Work,"" really did happen. The mere accusation of Sorcery was enough to get an indictment, and corruption of the Church has always been there; if you're accused, you have lost the battle.

Revulsion is the real star of this film, and watching these people doing these ghastly things to people, all in a days work, with God on their side, makes it excruciating to watch. One case in particular, has this LOVELY young woman on trial for consorting with the Devil; the truth? She was living with some nuns, and the Bishop raped her. The baby was seen as Satan's spawn, and the politics of the church wouldn't allow the truth to come out. She goes so far as to give a false confession, one she thought they wanted, and from there, it only got worse for her. Watching her ordeal made me physically uncomfortable; I had to keep reminding myself that she was just an actress, and this was a only film stage. But they really did this to people; that's what is so horrifying. THEY ACTUALLY DID THIS TO PEOPLE! WITH CHURCH APPROVAL! (""...doing the Lord's work is never easy..."")

This is an exploitation film, but one with a story-line, albeit a tragic one, and thank God the witch trials don't happen now.",1124496000,19,1715,4.672185430463577

876367,2,6304451032,"Recently I have become a quasi-fan of the gore/sh(l)ock genre and this film seemed like it would be a great addition to my ever growing collection. The subject matter and notoriety of the film were enough to intrigue me. However, to say that I was disappointed is quite an understatement.

Like other reviewers have stated, the film is actually quite well acted. The scenery is very lovely as well. That's about the only redeeming qualities I could find in this film. While I always try to keep in mind the date a film was made, especially when dealing with films in this genre, I can't imagine how anyone would find this to be ""the more horryfying movie ever made."" Not unless you're talking about the ridiculous dubbing one must endure throughout.

The torture scenes were mild at best unless you just can't stand the sight of low-grade Halloween fake blood. I was also under the assumption that the film would primarily focus on the more ""gorey"" aspects of the witch trials, but it didn't. Instead the film seemed to be more intersted in the pseudo-political struggles between the the inquisitor (Herbert Lom), his sadist in training (Udo Kier), and the wonderfully hideous Albino (Reggie Nalder). In all I'd estimate that the torture scenes comprised maybe 10-15 minutes total of this film...I could be wrong however, I may have fallen asleep.

I can, however still appreciate this film in the context that it was released as presented at the time it was. But, if you're really into high quality gore stick with Miike.",1118620800,,1522,4.801526717557252

876369,4,6304451032,"Mark of the Devil left its mark on me.  In college it was one of the few films I owned and too poor to own cable it was viewed quite often.  However these were pre-DVD days and now that this DVD has arrived I have resumed my love for this film.  With a truly remarkable amount of extras for such an old film including an interview with Gabby Fuchs, who became somewhat of a cult icon among my friends, this film is worthwhile to buy.

I need to inform you that this not the ""most horrifying film ever made"".  It is mildly sadistic and a little gory by today's standards but this film runs its entire course without any intentional humor or stupidity that is so common in today's horror movies.  As Albino says ""I may not be educated but I am not stupid"": I want movies that at least try to take themselves seriously.  This movie does that.

For a 35 year old horror film from Europe this film has had some staying power.  I recommend this one to fans of horror of all ages.  It is certainly something different from the hackneyed plots that the genre is so susceptible to.  If you've seen the movie before get this DVD too you will be pleased with the digital quality and the copious extras... Enjoy the torture...

876370,3,6304451032,"Released in 1969 this movie came attached with the tagline ""positively the most horrifying movie ever!"" and once the film was released in America, became famous for the distribution of barf bags to customers.  Does it live up to its tagline?  Well, sort of but only when you consider when the film was made.  It predated by a few years other more graphic torture films such as ""Ilsa"", ""Salo"" and ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" films released in the 70's , an era when things really got wild.  So yes I guess back in 69' this was about as hardcore as it got.

In a small village of a by-gone era, witch-hunting has reached its peak.  Villagers accused of sins such as ""having illicit intercourse with the devil"" or ""defiling the sacraments of the church"" are submitted to public displays of torture and execution.  Into the village arrives the character played by Udo Kier, who is a witch-hunter apprentice.  As he begins to learn the tools and tricks of the trade, Kier comes to the realization that the witch trials are actually a scam to rob people of their wealth and their land and also as an excuse to lay paws on beautiful women.  Kier attempts to organize a revolt against the crooked witch-hunters which in turn will lead to him getting his own taste of a little torture...

To my surprise, ""Mark of the Devil"" is not as pointless a film as I expected it to be.  I really figured this would be mindless exploitation consisting of nothing more than torture, however the torture scenes are not at the forefront of everything here.  This movie  actually has a carefully constructed plot, as well as beautiful scenic shots of the Austrian countryside and a heartfelt romance story between the lead female and Udo Kier.  The costumes are stunning and the acting is not all that bad.  What is REALLY bad however is the dubbing which goes from awful to absolute ridiculous. I'm referring especially to the scene involving two small children trapped in a cage, their voices sound like they're coming from adults!

As for gore, yes the film displays all sorts of atrocities such as women being burned alive, guys getting their limbs and fingers chopped off with meat cleavers and other things I know I would not be allowed to list here.  What makes these scenes shocking (and rather goofy in retrospect) are the matter-of-fact ways in which the torturers carry on their deeds, all the while as honky-looking villagers look on and cheer.  I have trouble imagining, in any era, middle-aged women and grandmothers gleefully pointing and laughing as people get decapitated right in front of their eyes but that's what we get in this movie.  Sure it drags after a while but ""Mark of the Devil"" is not such a bad movie and people who dig these types of flicks are bound to enjoy.  Barf bags are encouraged but not mandatory.",1106352000,12,2808,4.66869918699187
876371,4,6304451032,"Back in the day (1970), this film was probably the most controversal movie ever made as it depicted the witch trials going on Europe during the darkest page of human existance. I remember reading all the controversy and I couldn't help but watch the film that caused such a ruckous. I was expecting some really cheap, gory, pointless Eurotrash exploitation flick. What I got was much, much more. First of all, THERE'S A STORY! Yes this film actually has a good plot and story and is actually fairly accurate to some of the real happenings in history. Second, THE ACTING IS REALLY GOOD. The entire cast gives it their all and makes this film believable. The only hinderence is the dubbing, but for foreign horror film fans like me, dubbing just adds to the charm. I was pleasently surprised and got a much better film than I was expecting. I would actually recomend this film to fans of Hammer flicks that came out at about the same time. I however do not recommend this film for fans of pointless gore/trash cinema as they will not get what they expect. The tagline on the box is also misleading as it tags the movie as ""the most horrifying movie ever made"" which isn't exactly true. Yes it had some shocking moments, but in no way is it really horrifying. By today's standards, the shocks are pretty tame. So if your a fan of atmospheric Euro horror, don't believe all the bad hype as this film is a true gem of the genre.",1105747200,56,1423,4.476923076923077

876373,4,6304451032,"The first thing that catches my attention about Mark Of The Devil is the opening sequence with the Morricone-like music that graces it.  What I found to be disturbing was the fairy-tale like location and the sadism that visited.  The town seems like a peaceful alpine Mayberry, but its denizens will sell each other out to the worst forms of torture at the drop of a hat to save their own skins, which as the point of this movie proves, are worthless.  The real horror, and I do believe this was historically true, is the helplessness of everyone in this film to stop the events of witchfinding once they are set in motion.  There is nothing more terrifying than for someone else to have complete control over your life-and Lom holds a whole village in his hand, end revels in being able to pull their strings and bring out the worst qualities of the helpless villagers.
  Herbert Lom is adequate as the villain; he does a good job with his character's ability to barely conceal his Sadean lust.  Udo Kier is also interesting as the ingenue.  Granted where this film does begin to spin out of control is when the director tries to imbue his hero/heroine with a freewill choice of foiling Lom.  Then it's time to suspend your belief for the remainder of the film.  The ending almost redeems the original mood.  All in all a pretty worthwhile see.",1019174400,,1345,4.5625
876374,2,6304451032,"While purporting to be based on ""actual accounts"" of witch trials, MARK OF THE DEVIL is obviously serious about nothing except being a sadistic turn on. Make no mistake about it, this is a graphic, gruesome exercise in Nihilistic pessimism not to be viewed by the faint of heart. It is to violence what hard cord pornography is to sex: a reduction to and wallowing in the most explicit details the censor will allow. The fact that we know they are faked doesn't make the horrific actions any easier to watch.
With one major exception, the virtues of MARK OF THE DEVIL are all negative. It is refreshingly free of the optimistic cant that infects most movies. There is no effort at any ""positive human values."" Quite the contrary, the movie both dramatizes and appeals to the bestial side of human behavior. This emphasis on the negative doesn't make the film any more true to life than Hollywood's Pollyanna view of experience. Given how infrequently such negativism is allowed to be expressed on screen, however, its utter relentlessness here is salutory. People watch movies for all sorts of reasons, to match all sorts of moods. I don't see why we shouldn't have something to watch, say, after we've had to deal with an idiotic bureaucrat, or after we've been stuck in traffic for two hours, or after having to sit through a Disney movie... The film's bleak take on life can satisfy the darkest mood.
MARK OF THE DEVIL has the one positive virtue of many exploitation films, a lot of highly inventive filmmaking. This extends not just to the gory inserts, but to a first-rate use of the locations, a wealth of period d&eacute;cor, very sharp editing, and a resourceful, imaginative use of the camera. None of this is likely to make it less offensive for those who turn away from a negative portrayal of humanity. On the contrary, it may make it worse to know that the film was made by talented people.
