8060719,5,B0009HBP9Y,"OZ, I do remember watching it every week on HBO. Most episodes would increase my blood pressure by the sheer stress involved.
I had to get this serie on DVD. I must have watched the whole serie three times and I still love it.
All the actors are impeccable. I discovered a few in other series or movies but their roles in Oz is what's leaving me with the most intense memories.

I definitely do not intend ever going to jail! :)

Not recommended for faints of hearts, people with issues with curses, homosexuality, wild violence...

Recommended strongly for anyone else.",1300492800,,570,4.623762376237623
8060720,5,B0009HBP9Y,This is an incredible show. HBO really knows how to produce quality TV shows. The stories are awesome and they really get you involved into what is going to happen to these characters. The shows finale may leave you wanting for some closure but once you think about it there was no better possible ending fot this great show.,1168473600,,325,4.52542372881356
8060721,5,B0009HBP9Y,"Revolving around the lives of both inmates and workers of Oswald maximum security prison, Oz is raw, controversial and exciting.  Unapologising and uncompromising in its storylines and characters, prison drama is no way to describe what Oz is all about, because it is so much more.  With a unique way of portraying itself, Oz will hook you immediately.  Not for the faint hearted, swearing and violence are rooted in every episode, but beneath that surface is also a work of art.  It will cause you to love and hate, question and become conflicted.  It makes you think.  The characters of the inmates are strangely seductive, and the workers much the same.  Fantastic writing, fantastic acting, fantastic directing.  Oz breaks every rule.",1127520000,6,738,5.041322314049586
8060722,5,B0009HBP9Y,"Great & exciting show. I wish OZ was still on HBO.

Thanks for a great & reasonable price for the whole 5 seasons.

Thanks  5 STARS  JASON Simmons San Diego Ca.",1121904000,3,160,4.064516129032258
