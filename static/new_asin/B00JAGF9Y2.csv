6351643,5,B00JAGF9Y2,This DVD is not being released until late June but I have 3 copies on order.  I saw the film in a movie theatre recently.  It is  beautifully filmed and a loving ode to Tanaquil Le Cerq who had a sterling career with the New York City Ballet before being struck down by polio.  Interviews with her colleagues and personal 'home' movies give this film a heartwarming and insightful look into the Balanchine ballets that were created for Le Clerq and others. Highly recommended.,1398816000,32,476,4.630952380952381
6351644,5,B00JAGF9Y2,She was such a beautiful dancer.  It was so incredibly tragic what happened to her.  Very well done documentary.,1447632000,,112,4.842105263157895
6351645,5,B00JAGF9Y2,"Magnificent portrayal of Tanaquil LeClerck's life and troubles. Very well portrayed, excellent focus on important parts as well as supporting material about the treatment with ""iron lungs"" . It is well balanced and without moral judgements on Balanchine although using other resources enables one to appreciate the strength of Tanaquil to tolerate his infidelities and to subsequently reconcile with him to a degree that was of value to both of them. This bio leaves an indelible imprint, which unfortunately will be beyond the consciousness of millennials where ""history"" begins with the Beatles. If you haven't seen it or even ever heard the names LeClerck or Ballanchine do yourself a favor and watch it.",1445472000,3,707,5.265486725663717

6351651,5,B00JAGF9Y2,"One of the saddest tales known to dancers:  Tanaquil Le Clercq, who was cut down by polio at the height of her powers/career at 27, is seen here in motion as well as in slo mo and photographs.  Should be required viewing for anyone who has ever danced.  Or walked.  Heartbreaking.
That she lived to 80 and used her depth of knowledge and experience to teach others, while being confined to a wheelchair, is a beacon of hope.  Scenes of Balanchine.  Left to the viewer to judge.",1422576000,,477,4.425287356321839

6351655,4,B00JAGF9Y2,"Even those with little or no interest in ballet will be moved by ""Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq,"" a documentary about one of the finest dancers ever to grace the stage, one who, like Lou Gehrig, was struck down by a disease of unspeakable awfulness in the prime of her life (though, unlike Gehrig, she managed to live to almost 80 despite her illness).

A favorite pupil of famed choreographers George Ballanchine and Jerome Robbins, Tanaquil, or ""Tanny"" to her friends. stood out from her ballerina contemporaries due to her unusual tallness and angular frame. The film chronicles her rigorous, sheltered youth, her tumultuous marriage to Ballanchine, her phenomenal success on the stage. And, then, just as she was on the top of the world professionally, tragedy - of a particularly cruel nature for a person used to making a living and perfecting her art with her body - befell her in the form of a severe case of polio, a case so severe, in fact, that she was forced to endure time in an iron lung and ultimately to spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair.

Through an abundance of stills and kinescope recordings, we get to see a great deal of Tanaquil's work. These are supplemented by interviews with those who knew Tanny both on a professional level and as personal friends. Most poignant are the recitations of the letters Tanny wrote at the height of her illness, many of them from a rehabilitation center where she was receiving treatment. Her resolve and inner strength, along with and her almost nave hope for the future, pour forth in great abundance from the writings.

One thing that strikes us most in Tanny's post-polio life is her determination to remain independent in the face of her disability. And, indeed, the movie ends on a high note, as we learn that Tanny spent the better part of her life imparting her priceless wisdom and insight to young dancers from her wheelchair.

The movie provides an inspiring portrait of an inspiring person.",1413244800,12,1977,4.738372093023256

6351659,5,B00JAGF9Y2,Great.  This is the story of a beautiful ballerina who was struck with Polio.  She and George Ballanchine will always remain treasured icons in dance.

6351673,5,B00JAGF9Y2,"Excellent documentary. This was a very moving story about the artistic and personal life of Tanaquil Le Clercq. The narration from people (many of whom were dancers, such as Jacques D'Amboise and Arthur Mitchell) who knew her well was seamlessly woven into the film. Hearing the actual words of correspondences (although read by actors which didn't deter from the impact) between ""Tanny"" and Jerome Robbins was also very interesting and revealing. I did not know too much about her marriage to George Balanchine until this film, so that was yet another layer to this story.

The archival clips of dancing was a tribute to Tanaquil Le Clercq's artistry - her technique and musicality were very evident at her young age. Thank goodness for this DVD to capture such an important story. Don't miss it!",1404777600,2,797,4.947761194029851

6351675,4,B00JAGF9Y2,"This is a hard film to rate under Amazon's system. My sense is that for most casual viewers it will read as incomplete, though those who already know something [ or a lot] about Balanchine and Balanchine's ballerinas will appreciate it.

There are dance documentaries, such as The Ballets Russe, where a viewer who knows nothing of ballet will walk away having a gotten a great sense of the history, artistry, personalities, rivalries, and gossip involved in the company.

Here the problem is that we are given little back story,compounded by the fact that the interviewees are so polite and circumspect about revealing information -and that Tanaquil le Clerq, an intensely private person, almost reads as the Greta Garbo of ballet.

Despite the fact that her letters to her great friend Jerome Robbins [ and his to her] are read during the course of the film, they are very much in the spirit of the times, exhibiting a sort of beat sensibility--but demonstrate little window into the souls of their authors.

We do see clips of Le Clerq's lovely dancing [ very, very grainy] -but for the filmmaker to suggest she was the first of Balanchine's ballerinas to epitomize the look [ short torso, small head, leggy with great extension] sort of ignores the fact that Tallchief and Diana Adams, her contemporaries, were also very tall; ignores the existence of  Mary Ellen Moylan--and even that of Balanchine's Baby Ballerinas -particularly Tanya Riabuchinska who was 5'9'', and though more muscular, in some photos, looks very much like the prototype.

 LeClerq had the sort of gamine model look, both coltish and patrician, that was in vogue at the time, and apparently a great deal of on stage personality in addition to range, technical and artistic ability--but the narration does little to explain what it was that made her unique, aside from her looks [ and the dance clips from which we are to surmise this are rather short]. We are also told that she was a strong personality, and was a somewhat spoiled girl which helped her through her later life, paralyzed and in a wheel chair--but there is no demonstration of that assertion.

In mid-documentary, at the height of her career, Tanaquil is stricken by polio, followed by a long sequence that shows clips of others--primarily children in iron lungs, the type of therapy given and so on.  We are then shown photos which show her, in a wheelchair,  entertaining her friends, traveling a bit, teaching--and are told that Balanchine tried to rehab her [ he had some strangely mystical ideas about how that should be done, all the while believing he had brought on her fate by casting her as a polio victim in a piece choreographed for a charity fund raiser]  and failing, left her for the the unattainable Suzanne Farrell, his next muse.

But in all those years we know nothing of what LeClerq might have been thinking, feeling, what occupied her--its almost as if she is viewed exclusively through her relation to the two men in her life, Robbins and Balanchine.  I did do a bit of research afterward, and there is a book, a fictionalized biography, The Master's Muse by Varley O'Connor, and a scathing article in the New York Times reviewing it [Holly Brubach, Feb 2012] --which  seemingly might fill in the missing pieces.",1403308800,9,3277,4.838998211091234
