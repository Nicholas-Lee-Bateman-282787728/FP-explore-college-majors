8623873,3,B00GJT2CG6,"These are good spaghetti westerns, but the transfers are all pretty terrible. The four-disc collection is worth it to find out if you enjoy the movies (Death Rides a Horse is a spaghetti western classic), but if you do, be prepared to invest in better transfers that aren't such a chore to watch. Also no extras of any sort and only the most rudimentary of menus, no chapter selections either. This set would be a better value at five dollars.",1404172800,,443,4.55
