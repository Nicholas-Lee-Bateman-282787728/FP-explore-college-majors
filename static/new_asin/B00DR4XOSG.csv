8596539,3,B00DR4XOSG,It's a great anime and hilarious for even kids. But the biggest issue I had with this exact product is it being a region 2 item. Now not saying there is anything with that it is however extremely problomatic if you aren't region 2 already.,1502064000,,239,4.333333333333333

8596542,4,B00DR4XOSG,"Kenichi is probably one of the reasons I have gotten back into anime. Aside from the fact that the only gateway to anime nowadays is to be a teenager stuck waiting a week to watch one of about 6 anime episodes doomed to be repeated, or stream it. Otherwise, you'll either have to depend on YouTube copyrights not to slam down or blindly search for reviews and try your luck.

Anyway, kenichi gives me the same sort of feeling kekkaishi gave me back when I used to go to school. The character development is usually why I bother watching anime and it is strong here, however, it isn't something that gets completely tossed out after a few episodes or season 1. You'll be with them all until the end and to me that is something that is very unique, show us characters that are interesting and don't kill them off or kill them.

That aside, kenichi is your typical weak anime boy given purpose through women and grand opportunities, surpassing trivial trials, making friends, and solving his own problems and even everyone else's. Serving under several martial artists, studying I should say, to use and commit to multiple disciplines of martial arts. Eventually integrating it into his life.

Of course, the struggle has related problems, such as bullies and miscreants and while solving his own problems creates more, there could easily be an argument between where his responsibility as an able bodied martial artist becomes the problem rather than it being as direct as it used to be.

I think the best part of this is how integrated the characters lives are together, which is why it relates a lot to kekkaishi so much in my opinion. The story and plot is very memorable and it ends up not being enough because of how far you could really stand to go with the great character development. But honestly, it's such a good anime because of this.

I guess the one star is because I honestly don't think it should still be that expensive.",1451088000,3,1935,4.629737609329446
