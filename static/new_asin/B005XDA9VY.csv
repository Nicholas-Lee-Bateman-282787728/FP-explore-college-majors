I cant believe this woman charges for this. The documentary is actually kind of depressing. It is clear that the students have a lot of spirit and they're lovely young ladies but taking classes at the studio and worst of all paying for them, is a terrible mistake .",1522281600,,430,4.320987654320987

Sweet girls spending time and dreams, and probably money, need more technique and possibly a ballet class or 2 added to the training.",1521676800,,235,5.051282051282051

I mean...what's the big deal? Just a lazy Saturday at home looking for something to watch on Amazon Prime.
The thing is, what I just watched is a big deal and it affected me deeply. Sadly, the effect was not a positive one.
As a former professional ballet, and Broadway, dancer myself and who now takes on the massive  responsibility as an Artistic Director/teacher of both pre-professional and recreational dance students...I was shocked at the poor technical level of these kids!
To see such a large, income producing, studio with hundreds of young, eager, children looking to you to help them make their dreams come true only to find out years later that they didn't receive the tools neccessary to get into a college dance program let alone a professional company or show is nothing short of criminal!
They are being robbed of the basic foundation required to even attempt a possible career in dance! Not to mention keeping their little bodies, growth plates, strong and injury free.
There's a reason that jazz classes should NOT be given to children under a certain age or technical ability and this program definitely demonstrates that point quite well...especially noticeable during their lyrical routine.
I realize that at almost every studio around the Country, with the exception of truly professional and established schools such as SAB, etc..might only have one or two perecent of their students who actually want to go on to pursue a professional career and that it is difficult for these schools to figure out how to balance the recreational kids, which usually make up the majority of the studio's population...or as I call them..your bread and butter, with the needs of the more serious students BUT...that is the job that you signed up for the second you accepted tuition fees from these kids parents!
It's a massive responsibility and I cannot stress that enough!
My heart broke for that senior dancer who wanted so badly to get into a good University dance program. It seemed that she had more insight into the requirements needed to be accepted than those whom she looked to for so many years to help guide her way. You failed her..period.
Yes, it's a fact that dancers will not be accepted into every company, production,  program, that they audition for (understatement) but they should, at the very least, be able to be confident with the years of training they've put into this art.
The only bright spot was the camaraderie between the dancers which is always good to see. Dance creates lifelong friends..it can't not when you spend more time with your fellow dancers than pretty much anyone or anything else.",1503705600,2,2742,4.881974248927039
8488608,5,B005XDA9VY,"My youngest daughter and I love this movie so much. It's so inspiring and interesting to be taken into these dancers' lives and see what really goes on behind the scenes. My daughter has started dancing because of this movie!!

Great film over all :)",1392249600,,250,4.555555555555555
8488609,3,B005XDA9VY,"This film is about an ""elite"" dance team of middle school age to high school age girls.  It's a documentary that follows them through a single year, with a lot of focus on the leader of the dance school, Jenn.

I normally thoroughly enjoy dance movies, mostly the fictional variety, but also documentaries.  However, I found this one only mediocre for a few reasons.  First, I didn't really get a sense that these were truly elite dancers.  Good, yes, but elite?  No.  Second, I didn't really feel I got to know any of the individual dancers well.  There were one-on-one interviews with about four of the dancers but they just seemed a bit superficial.  Third, the big conflict in the movie, the poor Christmas recital, seemed a bit forced.  The drama just wasn't there.

If you're into dance, it's not a bad film, and you probably won't regret watching it, but you won't remember it for long.  If you're not into dance, definitely skip it!",1354924800,,940,4.63030303030303
