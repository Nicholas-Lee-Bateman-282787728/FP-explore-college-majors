7787779,5,0005134188,"I picked up this video (Cedarmont Kids, Toddler Tunes VHS) at a local store's bargain bin for just a buck. I wasn't expecting much out of it but have been pleasently suprised how much my 3 1/2 year old son LOVES LOVES LOVES it. He will watch it over and over again. It features about 10 children ranging from 2 to 10 years old singing, dancing, and in dress-up acting out the songs. Each song they sing has a different theme, like one song they'll all be on a school bus singing, another song at the park, another song at the local store, on a train, at a farm etc. Some seem to be american kids and some seem to be british. There is one or two songs where the scenery looks like they are in England, like one where they are singing with a beautiful castle in the background.

The video itself is not high quality production, but more of songs and scenery of older times, it's very sweet, wholesome and simply presented. My son sings the songs when he plays, even when the video is not playing he has memorized them and sings them in play, it's just delightful. When he watches the 35 minute video he just loves watching the children act out the songs, like jack and jill song, two children roll down a hill etc, the songs are acted out. I would recommend for ages 1 to 6 years old.

Songs the children sing include:

The Wheels on the Bus
The Alphabet Song
God Made Me
Eeney Weeney Spider
The More We Get Together
Six Little Ducks
Mulberry Bush
Baa Baa Black Sheep
Roll Over (10 In The Bed and The Little One Said, Roll Over)
