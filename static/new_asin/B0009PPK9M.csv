8064884,5,B0009PPK9M,"As I'm new to fly tying, I found Bob's dvd to be insightful and well made (its filmed from his shop in Montana).  Bob is also somewhat old school, as he does not use the whip finisher tool, but otherwise, he takes his time to illustrate the basic fundalments of fly tying.  And he has some funny little one liners and stories about various flys he's made as well that add to the background history of some of his flys.  Overall, a good buy for the money.",1360281600,,454,4.195402298850575
8064885,4,B0009PPK9M,A fantastic DVD for the beginner or pro.  I've been tying for 40+ years and picked up some great new ideas.,1155686400,,107,4.095238095238095
