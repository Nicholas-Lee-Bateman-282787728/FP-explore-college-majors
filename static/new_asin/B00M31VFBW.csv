It is an acquired taste, though. The person I watched it with thought it was just okay. But I really loved it.",1418169600,,283,4.071428571428571
6554625,3,B00M31VFBW,"First off, this movie has been dubbed into English, and there is no option to watch it with subtitles in it's original language.  This is the biggest downfall of this movie.  It is very distracting to watch lips and hear words that do not match the lips.  Plus the voice over actors are way too American for this film.

Overall, this is a heartwarming, family friendly, and magical film.  The story line is an interesting twist to the old classic of Santa landing in earth.  It brings up holiday traditions that are cultural, but different from the standard US flair.  I like the Santa, the filming is lovely.  The special effects are fair.  The weakest part of the film story wise is the portrayal of the villains.  They get a little corny.  (there are evil nut crackers that leave something to be desired.)  However, I like the overall plot enough it makes up for that.  The ending is sweet with a happy message.  I think the children also do a wonderful job acting in this film.

Conclude:  I would recommend this film, but if you can get a hold of a subtitled version instead of the dubbed one, I recommend that.

Pros:
a new twist
cultural experience
good Santa
fairly good acting
nice holiday story
magical
family friendly

Cons:
alright special effects
highly annoying dubbing
corny villains",1413936000,3,1298,4.643171806167401

8669950,1,B00M31VFBW,I think this would be a good movie if the speaking would match the actors when they speak. I am not sure what this is actually called in the film industry but the actors speak and then the voice comes through about 2 minutes after they say something.  I really hated that I got a bad DVD because I was really wanting to watch another Christmas classic.  I will not order more movies from this seller.,1449792000,,400,4.25
8669951,4,B00M31VFBW,"AMERICANS a-r-e spoilt. Most don't realize that most American movies are dubbed into French, Spanish, etcetera.
The complaints about this being dubbed is ludicrous. In German-speaking countries---do you realize?---they don't even
hear Arnold Schwarzenegger's actual voice.
Get over it!
It's a CUTE, family-friendly, Christmas movie.",1447718400,,332,6.4
8669952,3,B00M31VFBW,"A family-friendly version of a familiar theme - children's effort to save Christmas. This is a German movie, dubbed adequately in English in this version. The setting in Northern Europe and small-town culture may not resonate with American viewers, but the struggles of a few families trying to make ends meet will. The ""Santa,"" the last of the true Santas is a thin young man who looks like he hasn't needed a razor yet. But pitting him against the villain - corporate greed controlling Christmas sales - works, oddly enough. With the help of a preteen boy and girl, themselves somewhat outcasts, a few elves, angels, and lovable reindeer, they manage to save the day.",1446854400,2,669,4.826086956521739
