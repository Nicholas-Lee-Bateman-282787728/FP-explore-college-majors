8013611,5,B0001KNHCC,This movie was a great portrayal of the Pearl Harbor Tragedy.  It was very emotional and very detailed. An excellent movie!,1249689600,,123,4.857142857142857
8013612,1,B0001KNHCC,"I thought when I reviewed the caption on what was involved with this video that it would be a good purchase.  I was scuttled.  I can't say anything good about this video.  The narration stinks, the movie clips are horrible, the historical facts on some of the narrative is questionable, and this video needs to be trashed rather than sold.  This is one of the lousiest video's I've purchased, and all I can say is, I encourage anyone thinking about buying it to save your money, and if you want it bad enough, give me your address and I'll send it to you free, postage included.  At least I'd be rid of this bilge rat of a documentary.",1184025600,4,635,4.3474576271186445
8013613,5,B0001KNHCC,"I loved this DVD!  I loved learning about these 2 great American battleships and all the interesting little facts throughout the program.  Stylishly presented with quality footage and tightly written in two separate sections; it's very easy to view.  It made me proud of these monstrously powerful ships and the brave people who designed, worked and died on them.  I highly recommend this title to anyone who loves American History.",1177632000,,432,5.128571428571429
8013614,1,B0001KNHCC,"As an amateur historian of the War in the Pacific, I was very disappointed in this DVD.  It brought nothing new to light.  It had very little battle footage. Most was file footage and some had nothing to do with either ship. The narration was forced and uneven. I felt there was so much more that could have been done with this topic. I had the feeling this was a rush job to get it on the market.",1168387200,4,397,4.076923076923077
