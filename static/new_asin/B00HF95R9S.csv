8632312,5,B00HF95R9S,"This is a very good interval exercise program for seniors.  I originally borrowed the dvd from my public library, and it was so effective, and relevant to the fitness concerns of seniors, that I had to purchase a personal copy for regular, ongoing use.  This fitness program offers a full and modified workout, so you can participate at your own level.  There is floor work, as well as the use of a chair, both for some of the exercises and for assistance with balance.  As for modifications, I have knee injuries, so I used the modifications for some of the exercises that would be more challenging for my knees.  A really good head-to-toe workout for seniors. As a senior, I'm more interested in strength balance, and flexibility, and not so concerned with by belly, butt, and thighs (ha, ha!), and for my money, this program offers a relevant and effective way to stay in shape for increasing heart rate, strength, flexibility, and balance.  Really good, fun, adaptable, and approximately 54 minutes in length.",1488240000,,1013,4.826589595375722
8632313,1,B00HF95R9S,"IMO, this is not a workout for any senior with even a minor disability.  If you are a senior who has been exercising (playing sports, golf, tennis, etc), this video might be for you to keep in your video library for rainy days.  I rented this video from my library and decided it is much too vigorous for me.  I admit I only watched the first few minutes of the warm-up.  Lots of jumping and kicking.  I have arthritis in my lumbar spine, and there's no way I can do this. My advice is to rent it first, if you can!!",1457136000,,516,4.069306930693069
