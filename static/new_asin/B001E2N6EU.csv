Plus: Awesome licks shown in a lead solo setting!! Jam Track is the same as the licks demo!! Great for hammering out licks!! The licks resemble what Stevie would play!! But the licks are not spot on!! Because of the way it's designed, I can put together a short run of licks using the solo's as a templete!! Almost to simple!!

Minuses: These aren't Stevie's licks even if they are close. Ok, I've learned the licks and worked with the Jam Track. What do I do now? There is no explanation as to where to go from here!! There is no explanation on how to move the licks to other keys!! Important questions aren't addressed!! Like: How can I increase the speed of the runs or licks for faster runs? Where can I get ideas for other licks? How do licks work over chord changes?

All in all this is worth it's weight in gold, as long as you realize what or where you can go with this!! Instruction is clear and easy to understand for what it is!! Basically speaking, your learning licks!! Licks only in one setting, the key of ""E"". The author is awesome to include them in a solo setting!! However, your world is tiny, the key of ""E"". My recommendation: learn how the minor pent. scales fit the key of ""E"". Learn to move the scale to the key of ""G"", ""A"", and ""B"". Once you learn how it fits different keys your world will become huge!!

8323664,4,B001E2N6EU,"This lesson builds in both technique and speed as the lesson goes forward which is perfect to learn this style of blues from. Each section of which there is 7 is explained in detail and solos shown at slower speeds. Timming and phrasing are important features to Stevies style and all of his famous solo techniques are covered here. If you played to this dvd 3 days a week (like i did) your knowledge and soloing will improve a lot. There is also a section on the blues scales used by SRV as well as the equipment used by Jammie to get his signature sound. What i liked about this was the fact that you don't need a ton of expensive equipment to try and emulate srv's sound just a few key pedals and amp settings which is explained.

The backer(backing track*) plays continous so you can practice what you have learned until you are ready to stop it and is pro recorded as well.
this dvd will help you wheather you are a advanced player like me or a new begginer IMHO.",1230508800,7,968,4.2896174863387975
