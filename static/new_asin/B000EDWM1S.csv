2516683,4,B000EDWM1S,"Few people are aware that the British Empire was as bad as this
with marching into a peaceful kingdom that had long time supported them.
The two landed gentry struggle to play the Indian version of chess in this time of transition. The story of the king asked to step down contrary to a signed treaty just so that the ""Company"" could make a higher profit
is a classical historic one. The other Indian kingdoms gained nothing but
Kipling novels for their efforts to resist.
We are told that Kipling was a great poet and novelist,
but it seems that he just may have been a picked sell out from India?
This movie is certainly a very different view of those times.
A very good movie with really beautiful filming
of period costumes and customs I would have this shown to world hisatory students.",1230076800,,791,4.5
2516684,4,B000EDWM1S,"This has always been one of my favourite films. I love almost everything from Satajit Ray but this is probably his best.

One of the most appealing feature of the movie is the language. On personal preference only, I classify Hindi/Urdu as one of the more beautiful, musical languages of the world and the dialog in this film is pure pleasure to listen to.

The only problem, which cost a star, is that my copy of the DVD is not very well produced. It's not actually faulty but this film demands lavish colour and sound which has not been captured. (On this same note, I have a copy of Dersu Uzala from the same outfit--Kino--and it's a shocker.)

So with this one caveat I recommend the movie to anyone who loves sumptuous cinema from a deep and strikingly beautiful culture, produced by one of the great masters of the medium.",1204761600,7,828,4.506666666666667
2516685,4,B000EDWM1S,"This film by Satyajit Ray is a deeply layered film.  It's a historical film, about the takeover by the British East India Company of the Indian kingdom of Oudh.  The title refers implicitly to the British as they maneuver for control without firing a shot, even as it explicitly refers to a couple of Oudh noblemen, descendants of mighty warriors, who care more about playing Chess than seeing (or doing anything about) what's around them.  There are a number of very memorable scenes, and the film leaves a lasting impression.",1195948800,2,527,4.833333333333333
2516686,4,B000EDWM1S,"Written and directed by internationally acclaimed Indian filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, ""The Chess Players"" is an award-winning film which would appeal to an international audience for its historic content blended with human drama and touches of humour and irony.  Unlike most Indian films known as `Bollywood', this film has none of the usual features of the popular musicals, and in fact, adds a few of its own unique touches such as comical animation to explain the historic setting of the story.  Although there is a brief song and dance scene, it is part of a performance given to the king, and the only touch of Bollywood is the narrator, `Mr Bollywood' himself, Amitabh Bachchan.  His narration explains the situation in India in 1856 when the British East India Company encroached on the last bastion of Indian rulership, but far from being an exciting, action-packed thrilling war movie, ""The Chess Players"" tells a more realistic story about attitudes, cultures and the personal lives of a few people caught up in the changing tide of events.  The chess players are two friends who are so preoccupied with playing chess all day that they neglect their family responsibilities and are unperturbed by the British plans to take over their city.  Even the Indian ruler himself prefers to compose songs and poems, fly kites and be entertained by his harem rather than attend to the affairs of state, and no doubt this film is something of a social statement as well as a history lesson.  But rather than a dry and dull historic epic, Ray has managed to tell the whole story through the two main characters, the chess players, often with a tongue-in-cheek humour which makes the film highly enjoyable.  Although realistic, there is still an elegant and artistic style overall, and ""The Chess Players"" is also visually impressive, with colourful authentic costumes of the period, real Mogul buildings and palaces, as well as characters speaking their own languages.  There are several scenes with English, and easy-to-follow English subtitles when locals are speaking Hindi or Urdu.  Very authentic, traditional Indian music is also heard at times in the background, adding to the overall realistic atmosphere of this period film.  There is no great, thrilling climax, suspense or attempts to overly entertain except perhaps with the subtle comedy about realistic events and human relationships, and perhaps this very feature of being down-to-earth makes ""The Chess Players"" a welcome change from either Bollywood or Hollywood, and although it was filmed in 1977, it is still fresh and even timeless due to its subject matter and first class performances by the fine actors, one of whom is Sir Richard Attenborough as the British General.  For an authentic, good dose of real India and its glorious royal history (albeit in decline), this film is hard to beat.",1194134400,19,2857,5.070362473347548
2516687,4,B000EDWM1S,"great for filmakers, students, crytics, but not for general audiences.

2516688,5,B000EDWM1S,"Ray's light but lacerating satire of upper-class decadence and the bigoted hubris of British traders in colonial India places a metaphorical stake right in the middle of a chess board: Kumar and Jaffrey's childish need to reenact endless war schemes with a board game while ignoring the real world highlights their ineffectuality as ""noble"" men. And as the British attempt to checkmate the flaky king, even open-minded, Hindi-speaking Captain Weston (Tom Halter) forfeits his conscience to buy in to the new regime. Sumptuous costumes, elaborate set design, and one mesmerizing, dervish-like dance sequence make Ray's ""Chess Players"" worth capturing.",1183593600,15,650,5.575757575757576
2516689,4,B000EDWM1S,"Ray's ""The Chess Players"" is his only film in Hindi/Urdu and is a masterful portrayal of one of the key moments in modern Indian history - where history's largest multinational corporation - the East India Company - is set to take over governance over the province of Awadh, ultimately sparking rebellion and the beginnings of the British Raj that would last until 1947. Ray's film is unique in so far as it exposes the decadence and complacency of the Indian elite - magnificently embodied by Jaffrey and Kumar and Khan as the Nawaab - at a time when British designs on India should have been apparent. The elite spent its time smoking hookahs, playing chess, composing poetry and operas oblivious to the creeping British authority that would ultimately wipe it away. The analogy or metaphor throughout is that of the chess-board, whereby the British have ultimately ""checked"" their Indian subjects without the latter even having realized. The performances are excellent; the screenplay, in classical Urdu is exquisite and the message - that countries colonized ultimately must share some of the blame for their fate - provides plenty food for thought.",1150243200,41,1153,5.073684210526316
2516692,5,B000EDWM1S,Excellent movie. Great insights into both the game of chess and the politics/history of India in the 1850s. The movie has some surprisingly profound moments along with some really funny ones.,1422835200,,191,5.193548387096774
2516693,1,B000EDWM1S,"I am surprised at how awful this movie was, considering all the high reviews on Amazon. Let me start by saying that it wasn't because it is subtitled, I love subtitled movies. It was just slow, the pace dragged, there wasn't a comprehensible story and I still couldn't tell you what the point of this movie was. I don't think it would have been as bad if there was a way to watch it at double time, or maybe even just read the script, because then it wouldn't drag as much, I think. I wanted to love this movie, but I am sad to say that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!",1414022400,,573,4.125
2516694,1,B000EDWM1S,Don't advertise a movie which is in a foreign language with subtitles without telling us before we decide to rent it.

2516695,5,B000EDWM1S,"Being interested in the worldwide culture of chess, I make a point of seeing every chess movie that comes along.
This is certainly one of the best. cutting back and forth between two stories, the
film delights us with a tale of two spoiled rotten gentlemen who want to do nothing but play chess, contrasted
against the historic drama of the unilateral British domination of one final Indian province.
For anyone who has been bored to tears by tedious chess films, I highly recommend this as a
light in the darkness. A nice, easy lesson in the cruel choices of those who think themselves
so terribly civilized, filled with dramatic moments, some hilarious and some quite heart rending.",1368316800,4,684,4.805084745762712
2516696,5,B000EDWM1S,"This film adaption of the 1924 short story by Munshi Premchand is one of my favorite films of all time.  Set in the princely state of Awadh, in the city of Lucknow, we follow two threads, one comic, the other tragic.  Add to this wonderful music and dance, and the experience from beginning to end is lyrical.",1362528000,,309,4.4035087719298245

2516698,5,B000EDWM1S,"Mr. Ray's portrayal of India's final holdout against British Imperialism is a lesson to all people's it is not just a historical account.  It is a human account of how people allow themselves to believe what they want to believe and choose the path of ease to their own detriment.

Using two different seemingly unconnected dramas to reveal human nature's folly and how no matter how different people may be in culture or material goods; there is a tendency to ignore the unpleasant.

The chess players, two friends of great means are so greatly obsessed with their games that they fail to acknowledge it's impact on their relationships and ultimately their lifestyle.  Each player cheats and at times their are spats.  Until one day, sharp, hurtful words are traded and then injury ensues.  It would seem that their friendship seems irrevocably damaged.  Meanwhile, the Raj is immersed in a fantasy world of the most lovely things, composing poetry and enjoying his riches.

All the while, the British demand more and more from the Raj to ""remain"" friends (not unlike a business owner pays protection money to the mobsters in his neighborhood).  However, the elite and the King fail to recognize the British continue to increase their demands to remain friends.  This is shadowed by the wives of the chess players actions towards their husbands for abandonment of their duties for their love of a game.

Eventually, it is most obvious that the chess game is a reflection of the British Empire's domination over all of India.  When the Raj is confronted with signing away his kingdom or facing a war (for which he has no army or weapons -since the British told him they would be his protection).  He must face reality.  Likewise, the chess players realize they aren't truly friends, they just share a compulsion.

This is an exceptional story with excellent foreshadowing.  Through the clever use of metaphors in the story; we are challenged to evaluate how we have sold our freedom to live comfortably.  Are we allowing trickery and laziness to fool us into thinking we can ""buy"" peace (which costs us little) until our own reality penetrates our fantasy with the truth.  We then realize we sold our soul for meaningless goods.",1342396800,,2228,4.88031914893617
2516699,4,B000EDWM1S,"I am not big fan of Roy's films,--too long, often too slow, and often too artsy for me. Of course, it has nothing to do with his creativity--I am just not fit enough to enjoy his works.:-) However, it was a good one--often comic, often sad and very balanced combination of politics, common human feelings and trifles, and a nice effort to give a glimpse of time when British Raj was about to engulf the Sub-continent in full force.
Recommend it if you like Indian style scripts. For a Western mind, it may be too slow.",1336694400,,518,4.40625
2516700,5,B000EDWM1S,"Films like this tend to be a reflection upon the societies that create them.  Perhaps this was not intended here, but the result seems to indicate so.  Drawing on actual events the movie chronicles the British East India Company's aquistition of the Proinvce of Oudh in 1856, a year before the historic and barbarous Seapoy Mutiny of 1857.  This is not your standard Bollywiood flick with song, dance and outlandish plots.  Here there are subtle pararells drawn.  The two dedicated Chess Players reflect the monied class of India at that time.  Decadent, lazy and easily influenced their fixation on playing Chess is a reflection of higher faults within Indian Society at that time, and perhaps even today.  Both are products of a restrictive Caste System, they are have arranged marriages which are loveless and bordering on dissipation.  Chess seems to give their lives a higher meaning which seems lacking otherwise.

The frivilous ruler of Oudh who is shown as a victim of British Colonialism was representative of his kind.  Indolent, inefficent, and whimisical he is a fair portrait of most of the independent petty rulers and princes of India at that time. Through a policy of divide and conquer the East India Company had gradually expanded its influence over the last century against such rulers as these.  Indeed, it is not surprising that the British were able to rule India in this fashion as the remnants of the decayed Mogul Empire were easily manipulated.  Had the British not done this a far more ruthless regime might well have been established by either France or Russia since India was not capable as a forged nation at this time to resist such.  A patchwork of petty rulers like this India had no greater sense of nationhood.  Even the Great Seapoy Mutiny a year later in 1857 was no expression of such, as some revisitionist historians would like to portray.

Although the British are shown rightly as opportunists, the film does gave some consdieration and character development to them.  Having Sir Richard Attenborough play General Outram is a deffinite plus and raises the film above the norm.  Saeed Jaffrey is always nice to see even though he tends to be a standard character in many films made during this period.  Recall MAN WHO WOULD BE KING where he plays a Gurkha!

1856 would prove to be the last year of John Company in India as the awful events of the Mutiny a year later would see Queen Victoria and the Crown assume direct rule of the empire.  Hence the RAJ would be born.  While modern sympathy's with perceived oppressed native peoples tends to be in vogue now, it is important to look at the historical facts.  Princely States like Oudh were often ruled incompetently.  When the British took over efficient administration usually resulted.  This legacy has been passed down to the India of today.

A great film with excellent characters and a fascinating historical background.  Well acted and directed with classic themes.  Should be better known.",1272844800,,2989,4.89065606361829
2516701,5,B000EDWM1S,This movie provided me with a glimpse of India I have not previously had. The dance scene was mesmerizing.,1269561600,,106,4.631578947368421
8108527,5,B000EDWM1S,"One of Ray's finest movies, perhaps the most refined, Shatranj ke Khilari (The Chess Players) is rich in so many ways that it is entirely possible to write several full reviews on individual aspects like the authenticity of its depiction of history, its social and political satire, the amazing screenplay by Shama Zaidi and Javed Siddiqi, or the poetry authored by Wajid Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh. It is also one of the best edited  films by Ray with a once in a lifetime performance by actor Saeed Jaffrey as a mughal nobleman. Ray, whose fascination for Lucknow and its last mughal king Wajid Ali Shah is revealed in the children's books he wrote, delivered a masterpiece of urdu/hindi cinema, without himself speaking the languages. The original story, written by Munshi Premchand, is a crisp, short masterpiece itself. Ray paints a bigger canvas, but faithfully preserves the essence of Premchand's style - the perfectly crafted comic telling of basically a sad chapter of India's history.",1526688000,,997,5.006024096385542
