8273189,3,B0019AW922,"Apparently met on its original release in 1972 with the kind of derision usually reserved for the latest Uwe Boll videogame adaptation and barely seen since (it didn't make it to the States for another two years and took a further four to get cursory distribution in some parts of Europe), Sergio Corbucci's Bandera Bandits aka Far West Story aka Sonny and Jed may be the only spaghetti Western whose hero actually eats spaghetti, and very messily at that. The spaghetti slurper is Tomas Milian at his crotch-scratching, woman-molesting grossest - he even drinks milk straight from a cow's teat in one scene - as a spectacularly vulgar (even by his standards) bandit being relentlessly pursued by Telly Savalas' vengeful prison gaoler. En route to nowhere in particular he finds himself saddled with Susan George's virginal tomboy as an unwanted sidekick and later mistreated wife as the two go on a Bonnie and Clyde-like crimewave that doesn't net them much money but does get every crook in the territory after them for a $2000 dollar reward and the promise of an amnesty.

It's certainly a more scattershot and chaotic affair than Corbucci's previous Westerns, but that's probably the point - it's all about catching the anarchic zeitgeist of a time when nobody believed in anything anymore, at least until one of the pair finally outgrows it. With Milian waxing lyrical about his desire to live like an animal, there's no prizes for guessing which one, but underneath it there are some rueful reflections on what it takes to survive in callous times: those who won't kill or steal lose, those who do quickly outgrow any pangs of conscience over the bodies they leave behind (""It's like making love. You always remember the first but after the second they're all the same""). Not that his two anti-social misfits are especially likeable, but they are just lower down on the corruption food chain than those pursuing them. But the emphasis is often on broad comedy and crude dialogue (few westerns can boast such a prolific number of F-bombs - the film's last line is even ""I love you, you mother******!""), poking fun at more spaghetti Western conventions than it honors - but again, that seems to be Corbucci's intention, even transforming Savalas' smooth villain mid-picture and having him seal his own fate rather than opting for the kind of confrontation the genre usually demands and ending with the misogynistic antihero all but emasculated. It's not great, but it's not bad either, though its rarity these days has consigned it to late-night screenings on the less visited cable channels in shoddy old panned-and-scanned prints that do the film no favors.",1374796800,,2663,4.957494407158837
