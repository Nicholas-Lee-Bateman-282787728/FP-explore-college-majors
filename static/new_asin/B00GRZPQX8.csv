6104709,1,B00GRZPQX8,"One morning there was a turkey who rushed up to all his other turkey friends on the farm with great enthusiasm saying ""guys guys I just got back from hanging out with the eagles and I learned to fly!!"" With a piqued interest, the other turkeys wanted to know what that was. The turkey opened the gate and lead the other turkeys to an open field where he taught them to fly.
Over the barn, across the field, by the duck pond and soaring far above the small town the turkeys went with their thrilling newfound ability.
Finally, the day had drawn to a close and the turkeys returned to the spot where they first learned to fly. After relating the day's events, they then walked home and shut the gate behind them.
As a flaming homosexual, liberal, democrat, self-moderate drinker, and well-respected public figure, it is important for me to impose my correct thoughts, actions and overall matra upon people. Most particularly, children need to be brought into acceptance and enacting these principles through their daily living. In turn others can and should be influenced to do the same things.
Obtaining an early release of this movie for home use, I take advantage of every opportunity I can be afforded to have children over to watch in in my home theather. The aforementioned intentions have delivered mixed results after they have viewed this movie. Many times, I see the children leave my home with their Republican parents in large enviromentally harmful SUVs and going to McDonald's for a vile juicy cheeseburger.
Not since the ""Lorax"" came out has a movie attempted to break the norm by indoctrinating guilt concepts that can reform young minds. This movie should get a five-star rating for effort for its bold message, but since the kids are still slow to learn after seeing it, I can only give it one as the results are not to my liking.
However, I am tempted to give it another star just for the sexual tension between the two male turkeys in the movie.",1389052800,5,1963,4.676300578034682

6104758,4,B00GRZPQX8,"Silly but fun, as two turkeys end up in a timewarp trying to survive a past they're unfamiliar with.  They land in 1621, days before the first Thanksgiving.  They want to change the menu.  Persuading everyone to appreciate their daring scheme doesnt go exactly as planned.............especially as they have no plan.  Things get blown up.  Myles Standish (Colm Meaney) is a vicious hunter determined to bag a turkey or two.  He sets deadly traps.  There are plenty of angry dogs.  Theres also plenty of slapstick.  But I don't think this movie will convince anyone to give up eating turkey.",1480291200,,590,4.878787878787879
6104759,5,B00GRZPQX8,"One of the very few fun family movies for Thanksgiving!  A tiny bit political if you're of that mindset, but goes right past usually and actually I can see some left and right in it.  Children rarely learn history any more, but you may need to explain there was a real Myles Standish who had nothing to do with turkeys.  Just fun for kids.

Turkeys, time machines...family films are getting dumber and dumber. Also, turkeys can fly. Huge plot hole. If they're in so much danger, they don't need time traveling turkeys from the future to save them...they could JUST FLY AWAY instead of all the Tarzanesque vine swinging and acrobatics.

6104891,1,B00GRZPQX8,"Wow this was terrible. Starting with the most basic problem being a film about turkeys that honestly don't look like turkeys, but instead resemble poorly-animated chickens, colorful blobs of fur or, in the case of Owen Wilson's turkey, he looks more like a violet worm. The story was unbelievably stupid and while there are a couple brief chuckles this was a chore to get through, and we actually stopped it a couple times for that reason. If anything this film was a bizarre study in political correctness and how it controls the writing in films these days: the two lead male characters are of the generic two molds, a pig-headed alpha-male (who challenges the other alpha-males) or a neurotic, uncertain wimp. The pilgrims are all depicted as dark, angry, brooding killers, including the excessively over the top Myles Standish, who was more a demented Captain Hook than anything else. The story was stupid and predictable and one you end up owing your brain an apology for.",1440460800,3,977,4.891566265060241

6104959,3,B00GRZPQX8,"I'd just watched the movie ""FREE BIRDS"" for the very first time only a few days ago, having never even been aware of this movie until just a couple of weeks ago; And I've just come away from doing a little looking into the information about this movie and was disturbed seeing how it was so viciously assaulted and panned by the crapslinging brigade of professional and semi-professional ""film critics""! So in response, I came here to the Amazon ""CUSTOMER"" reviews to get the perspective of the ""VIEWING AUDIENCE (slash) CUSTOMERS"" (you know... the people whom movies are actually made for?), and I was left with a considerably better opinion of my fellow Americans for a change, who were clearly seeing things in and about this movie that the rush of self-important (and often pretentiously witty) ""movie critics"" clearly could not grasp.

Personally, I suspect that a large portion of their expressed displeasure stems from the fact that this was not a ""Disney/Pixar"" entry into the market, since it's never escaped my notice that the ""mouse"" always seems to get one pass after another for their animated works, even when much of what they release is formulaic crap... or just ""crap,"" period. But I've also been discovering an additional insideous motivation behind much of the hate being expressed toward this film, and it was not anything that had even in any slight way crossed even MY abundantly-cynical mind -- THIS MOVIE HAS A HIPPIE-DIPPY LEFTY-LIBERAL ""PETA"" AGENDA WHOSE INTENT IS TO BRAINWASH EVERYONE'S KIDLETS INTO ESCHEWING ANIMAL FLESH FOR MISERABLE DIETS SUBSISTING OF ONLY GRASS & TOFU AND OTHER JOYLESS VEGETARIAN/VEGAN MEALS???? ARE YOU PH_KKING SERIOUS???!!! Pleeeeease tell me there really aren't knuckle-dragging masses out there who honestly and truly BELIEVE this Konspiratorial Krap and are trying to pass that off as their excuse for hating this movie! Have we become that disassociated with the reality of our lives in this country now that we'll scream every indignation about a kiddie movie which has the utter gall to actually dare & challenge children to ""think outside the box"" a little bit and act as if it's the worst thing ever if a movie might possibly make some people (young and old) ""reconsider"" some of our long-standing traditions, but see no problem at all with airline gate ""imaging scanners"" peeking beneath our clothing (including your ""CHILDREN'S"" clothes, I might add) and so-called ""inspectors"" running their hands up our crotches? Is this who we are now? (By the way, I'd bet real Monopoly Money that many of those same mouth-breathers accusing this movie of being little more than ""Pinko-PETA Propaganda"" are among the same ones who'll bloviate that violence in movies doesn't influence kids to become violent themselves.)

As for the film itself, my defense of ""FREE BIRDS"" is not a case of me coming to the front of the line and gushing unconditionally about how great and fantastic this movie is... because it's not. I'm not saying it's the most spectacular CGI animated movie ever... I'm not even saying it's a ""good"" movie. Some of the criticisms about how and where this movie is lacking are genuinely legitimate, but they need to be looked at in a more ""fair"" light, which is made explicitly evident based on the severe disparity of opinion between the ""critics"" and the common everyday folks who have viewed this movie.

I completely agree that ""FREE BIRDS"" got off to an amazing start which quickly hooked me and reeled me in, but once we got to the ""birdnapping"" scene and subsequent time-travel aspects of the story, while still engaging for the most part, progressively lost most of its steam. But they gave it ""The Ol' College Try,"" as the saying goes, and we can only speculate how a better yarn could have been weaved -- perhaps (in my opinion) a much better story could have been told had they eliminated the ""time travel"" angle altogether and simply revolved everything around ""Reggie the Pardoned Turkey"" and built a series of adventures around that instead. But let's be fair and admit that taking this concept and trying to build a sustainable story around it for an hour and a half is no easy task to begin with, and the fact that making this story into a movie was even tried at all should be considered commendable -- (a better vehicle for this type of story might have been as a half-hour television special). But ""FREE BIRDS"" is still worth a watch, even if only as a rental, but it also has enough redeeming qualities about itself as well to warrant consideration for home purchase as well... but only if you're not going to insist on being *TOO* critical about its shortcomings or unjustifiably perceived ""dark hidden agenda.""",1420502400,,4704,4.8922305764411025

6105036,2,B00GRZPQX8,"Free Birds
 At their best childrens animated films are magical, wonderful, and iconic and can be enjoyed for generations.  Free Birds might not rank at the top of the heap in this respect but I found it mildly entertaining.  Two turkeys stumble into a government experiment and get transported back to the time of the first Thanksgiving.  The unlikely pair consist of a real turkey hero, a dim witted, two drumstick bird of action and a Casper Milquetoast intellectual type.  They have the intention of reconfiguring the menu of the traditional holiday feast thereby saving generations of turkeys from an early demise.  They introduce pizza to the Pilgrims.
 We want an animated feature to have plenty of motion, color and sight gags for the wee ones to enjoy.  We also appreciate the occasional adult reference for the grownups to enjoy.  Free Birds supplies both, but in trickles in places where we want torrents.
 Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson supply the voices to the leading turkeys.  We are also treated to the voice of George Takei as the combination time-machine/space ship.  Takei, famous for his role as Mr. Sulu on Star Trek must have had fun with this assignment.  He does sound happy.
 Director Jimmy Hayward also directed the magical, wonderful and iconic Horton Hears a Who of Dr. Seuss fame.  He attempted but failed to make a watchable film from the comic book derived Jonah Hex, a live action film.  Haywood also cast himself as the voice of several characters.  Having control of a film does deliver unexpected benefits.  Hayward also takes a credit for writing the script.  The little asides and jokes for the elder set are his gift to the grandfolks who sit through the one and a half hour film with their descendants.
 All in all we take Free Birds as uninspired, just a time filler for youngsters.  It carries a mild PG rating, as innocuous as the rest of the film.  One feature that might be objectionable to some viewers has the turkeys of the 17th century modeled on a Native American Indian tribe.  Seeing turkeys done up in war paint might seem over the top to some people
 The producers provided a reported $55 million to create this decidedly lukewarm film.  Thus far the effort has returned a lukewarm $42 million at the box office.  The producers might well rue the day they green lighted this project.
 Making good animated features is just as hard as making a good movie of any sort.  This two saw blade film is a cautionary example.  Take the wee ones, don't expect much, eat popcorn.",1412294400,,2521,4.717889908256881

It is not for seeing in the day of thanksgiving,without the heart,mind and spirit of the holiday at familial gathering for love,understanding and forgiveness. It is about shooting,killing and war on the turkey as American""Red skin""Indian. A.Indian as turkey with red skins in the fighting with the new ""White""settler,for the survival. More war,not a peaceful, joyful and educational movie. Dead,not for the real value of peace between the new settler and native A.Indian,as peace,togetherness and sharing at any times,seasons or differences.

It made light of the REAL reason the PILGRIMS (remember them?) were celebrating and giving THANKS to GOD (hence the term THANKSGIVING).

A little drama, a little humor, a fun adventure. The plot is pretty simple: two turkeys who are unlikely friends at first, team up and travel back in time to the First Thanksgiving. Their goal is to change the course of time and get turkeys off the menu. Woody Harrelson's character was my favorite.

It's about 2 turkeys that go back in time to change the tradition of eating turkey for Thanksgiving.

6105332,1,B00GRZPQX8,"This movie was awful in so many ways, I'm not sure where to start.  The funny parts were all included in the trailer.  My kids set a pretty low bar for what makes them laugh in a movie - they didn't laugh a single time with this one and only smirked a few.  Nevermind that the movie made Miles Standish out to be some kind of freaky bandit and the Pilgrims a bunch of simple minded fools.  The pizza delivery from the future, the way the turkeys looked like caricatures of Native Americans, the boring way the story moved glacially along.  I am grateful that our 48 hours of time has expired with this rental so that there's no danger of me having to see any part of it again.",1395100800,11,676,4.1692307692307695

6105334,2,B00GRZPQX8,"While this movie entertained my kids, ages 7, 5 and 3, I found it to be boring and have a strange plot. It started out ok but then went way out of left field when the turkeys found a time machine and went back in time. At this point, they still could have made it work...but then they bring in the whole ""Great Turkey"" concept and a magical door knob and things just keep getting weirder and weirder. Eventually, it wasn't entertaining enough to hold my attention and I fell asleep. The animation was cute but I definitely don't plan on watching it again.",1395014400,,555,4.346153846153846

Although I think this movie fell a bit short with its story that is a bit lacking, I like Wilson and Harrelson's performances.  Unfortunately, the movies plot that fell into the same type of storyline that is often repeated in many animated films.  There are some moments of laughter but this movie is probably more enjoyable for the smaller audience than it was for us adults.  I thought this movie was lacking something that others I have seen have had (like Despicable Me 2), not sure what it was, whether it was missing the cuteness factor, or more humor or a better plotline which made it more of an average watch rather than something better than that.",1394841600,3,839,4.5364238410596025

6105456,5,B00GRZPQX8,"I brought four kids ages 7-12 to see this movie, and they all enthusiastically enjoyed it. We adults found it mildly entertaining--not as fun as Lego Movie but not a snoozer where we were looking at our watches every 10 minutes either.

This is not a particularly deep film.  I'd call it slightly thought-provoking entertainment. First of all, it's certainly not a great analogy for how the Native Americans were treated in America, as many Indian reviewers have pointed out elsewhere.  Second, it's not even a particularly great animal welfare or rights movie, since they end up eating pizza.  (Maybe cows going back in time to get dairy cheese off the Thanksgiving meal will be the sequel ... What about all those baby calves separated from their mamas and slaughtered for veal so we can take their milk?  Think about it: If this was a serious attempt to convert everyone to animal-harmless eating, everyone would be eating vegan casseroles and faux meat roasts by the end, not pizza.)

If there's any agenda here, it seems to stop at prompting kids to think for a second or two about how a cultural holiday like Thanksgiving could be seen differently by folks with different perspectives.  The rest is just a fun movie that the kids really enjoyed.  I was surprised how much they really liked it, because I had read all those bad reviews prior to bringing them.

There are some extremely weird sci-fi sides to this movie.

2. Shallow and stereotypic characterizations. Lacked emotion, humor and intelligence.

I am a vegetarian so anything that takes meat off the menu is a good thing, lol. I liked that it brought out the value of family and working together. What I didn't like was how it portrayed the people during the time period of the first Thanksgiving. I know it is just a movie but still, I felt like it really portrayed the people of that time in a negative light. I felt like it really did an injustice to the people who actually lived during those perilous times, who came together and helped each other out. The leader of their little clan or colony was portrayed as a selfish person who was hiding all the food from the people and the people were ready to fight because of it. I felt like the movie made light of and even belittled in a way, that beautiful, brief moment in history when people came together to help each other survive. I mean, it didn't bother me to the point of boycotting the movie or something, it was still cute and I would probably watch it again.",1392163200,,1073,4.138755980861244

I liked the confidence of the girl bird, I like the softness of the macho birds, I like the characters because they are able to change for the better.

The only portions that were remotely funny were a few of the lines by the military men in the yellow body suits (that were shown in the previews), and those characters were only in about 5 to 10 minutes of the film.  The movie obviously ""attempts"" to entertain an adult audience, as well as the young children that it is obviously geared towards, but it fails to do so.  It is predictable, at best.  I would recommend turning on the movie for your little kids (7 and under) and then going and cleaning the house while they watch it...that way you'll accomplish something while your kids get to enjoy the animation.",1391817600,4,684,4.581967213114754
6105555,4,B00GRZPQX8,"This is a great movie for children of all ages as well adults. The begging the movie stated very clearly they the events aren't accurate to history and the writing team, as far was we can tell, haven't inserted some secret message to not eat turkey. The story is centered on a turkey. The writing did however have a lot of random bits of action that was simply hilarious and fun to watch. They do get carried away with the silliness at times.

Once again we have not seen any attempt to include some super secret message not to eat Turkey on thanksgiving or any other holiday for that matter. Its simply a fun movie for ..most people to enjoy.

-----------------------------------------------------Another Subject About Tradition--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now for those wanting to go on the warpath because a child's movie features a character that doesn't want his people killed let me tell you a story about tradition.

Once upon a time there was a young newly wed couple enjoying a conversation in the kitchen. The new wife wanted to make her husband a nice meal and decided to prepare ham. She cuts the nob off the end of the ham tosses it in the trash and puts the rest in a pan to cook it. The husband (confused) asked why she did that because they could eat that. The wife said that's something she saw her mother do when she was a girl.

So the couple asked the wife's mother why she cut the end of the ham off and threw it away. The mother told them that it was something she saw her mother do and never knew why. So the couple asked the wife's grandmother why she did that and the grandmother replied that was something she saw her mother do and never knew why. Fortunately the wife's great grandmother was still alive and they asked her why she cut the end of the ham off and tossed in the trash. The great grandmother told them that the pan she had was too small and the ham wouldn't fit so she had to cut the end off so it could fit.

There are more to traditions than you think. Just because its always been done a certain way doesn't mean it should always be done a certain way.

6105556,4,B00GRZPQX8,Good story line. Gives nightmares to us Thanksgiving turkey eaters. Kids did love it! Great babysitter for 3-7 yr. olds.,1391817600,3,120,5.05
6105557,3,B00GRZPQX8,"If you watched any of the previews during the time it was in the theaters....you saw the movie.  My kids liked it, I thought it was rental worthy only.",1391817600,,151,4.206896551724138
6105558,5,B00GRZPQX8,My family thought this movie was original and hilarious. It's one of the funniest we have seen in awhile. -Awesome,1391731200,2,114,4.75
6105559,4,B00GRZPQX8,"This was a very funny movie with great plot and characters that you will not soon forget. I was impressed with the cartoon artistry in the movie as well. The voice actors make the characters come alive and even though the idea behind the movie may make some younger kids question that turkey you are eating on the table, it is light with humor that both kids and adults can enjoy. On top of the humor though there is plenty of action that keeps the movie moving.

Overall, the movie itself was definitely family friendly and entertaining and a movie that my whole family thoroughly enjoyed.

*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*",1391731200,2,646,4.512820512820513
6105560,1,B00GRZPQX8,Boring. Terrible. My 9 year old had only intermittent interest.  It was a tough one to watch all the way to the end. I don't think we even laughed at the parts that were supposed to be funny.,1391731200,2,191,4.026315789473684
6105561,5,B00GRZPQX8,"I don't watch very many animated shows with the kids, but this one was so cute....lots of action also kept it interesting",1391731200,2,121,4.545454545454546
6105562,3,B00GRZPQX8,Kids really enjoyed it. Wasn't as fun as some for the adults but overall entertaining and cute. I would tell others to see it,1391731200,,125,4.25
6105563,4,B00GRZPQX8,"A fun and entertaining romp, with beautiful art and perfectly acceptable characterisation and animation. Some of the press reviewers seem to have thought the plot too convoluted.  But I understood it all just fine first time around. For its target audience of 7-11 year olds, this is a very fine entertainment. The script is sharp, the diction is clear, and there's a lot of kid style humour.  At the start I thought we were destined for a humdrum turkeys-against-farmer re-run of the forgettable Chicken Run.  But the movie soon takes off, quite literally, in what has got to be the most beautifully art-directed time-machine sequences ever put on screen.  Admittedly some small parts of the animation could be better, especially the hunting dogs which feel like they've escaped from a cheap 1980s Saturday morning cartoon.  The music is nothing to write home about.  But such minor quibbles are petty, when you consider how much else was done well by Reel FX on a low budget.  In exchange we get none of the tedious Shrek-style clowning that's supposed to make animation ""appeal to adults"", just good well-paced storytelling.  There are even some interesting ideas.  Though this isn't the nutty animal rights manifesto that I had feared, and is unlikely to have kids refusing to eat their turkey fritters on Thanksgiving. More interesting is that it shares ideas with the movie Cloud Atlas, oddly: such as the intelligent egg-like Orison; the connections across time; the importance of personal testimony about experience, in terms of changing the future and the past; the creation of new religions and the importance of belief.  But most kids won't see that.  What they will see is a quirky funny movie that is meant just for kids, which tells an entertaining story with sharp voicework and is full of beautiful characters - and even more beautifully lit and designed scenes.",1391644800,4,1878,4.987179487179487
6105564,4,B00GRZPQX8,"The script may not be the strongest or most clever in the history of animated films, but there's much to enjoy in this whimsical story.  It is the nature of cartoons that they be filled with caricature and exaggeration, so don't expect a history lesson on the first Thanksgiving.  It's just a fun romp with historical characters, playing fast and loose with the historical facts.  And for those who think the movie is filled with anti-meat or anti-Thanksgiving propaganda, that's just ridiculous.",1391644800,,496,5.024390243902439
6105565,1,B00GRZPQX8,"This movie is quite simply very bad.  When thinking of this movie I reminded of one of my favorites movies, Planes Trains and Automobiles. In that very good movie the Steve Martin Character has some advice for the John Candy character when he is telling a story.  "" Have a point, it makes it so much better for the listener"" and that would apply for this movie.  This movie couldn't keep the adults attention nor the children's as it kind of just rambles aimlessly.  It just isn't a good movie, save your money and time.",1391644800,,520,4.442105263157894

6105567,5,B00GRZPQX8,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter, partly because we missed it at the theater and partly because she was at my workplace and needed entertainment.  She loved it and has watched it lots of times.  Highly recommend.",1391558400,3,220,4.475
6105568,2,B00GRZPQX8,"Not all that enjoyable. Miles Standish looks like a wild west villain instead of a Puritan, and carries a double barrel shotgun, instead of a musket. No clear explanation for so many things in the movie. A turkey with a heavy Mexican accent, turkeys of every color imaginable, why was there a time machine in a shed at Camp David?

6105579,5,B00GRZPQX8,"WOW... I am a little shocked by some of the reviews by some very angry customers... I have to say I agree with one who says that this movie is not more ""animal-rights-friendly"" than ""Charlotte's Web"" or ""Babe"" or ""Chicken Run"" or any others.

I understand that eating Turkey for Thanksgiving is a huge tradition, but I think it's fair and even healthy for our kids to know that there are other options and that you don't HAVE TO eat turkey to have a good holiday.

Turkeys fighting for their rights and not wanting to be eaten is pretty natural, if you ask me. Everyone knows the animals they eat did not want to be eaten. It's not new or a secret for kids... or is it? If it hurts to be reminded of it, then maybe people should re-think their eating habits a little! Those who are perfectly ok with how they eat should not be offended by the message in this movie.

I personally thought it was funny and cute, and with a nice twist at the end which my kids really enjoyed.",1391385600,38,973,4.248648648648649

6105582,5,B00GRZPQX8,I took my kids (ages 6 & 11) to see this movie .  Plain and simple - it is a funny kids movie that my kids want to buy so they can watch it again at home.  p.s. my kids eat turkey.,1390780800,7,180,3.261904761904762
6105583,1,B00GRZPQX8,"I loved the trailer , I love the second trailer and what was my reaction. to words , IT SUCKED . The story was lazily told and the jokes are just one terrible joke after another and has some of the worst voice acting since Hoodwinked 2 . The animation is the pure example of laziness never taking risks and looking dull with nothing but dark red and un-appealing brown . It has very unlikeable characters and forgettable music. This is a pure example of why animated films made by small studios almost never work . This gets a D-",1390608000,2,529,4.3
6105584,5,B00GRZPQX8,"You should think twice before you eat that Thanksgiving turkey this year!  Especially after you watch the movie, ""Free Birds""!  This is a wonderful animated comedy, packed with lots of action and adventure.  Two turkeys team up to travel back in time to try to take turkey off the Thanksgiving menu for good.  If this doesn't sound funny enough, these two turkeys have nothing in common with each other, argue constantly, and run into some hilarious situations when they travel back to pilgrim days.
In order to change the course of history, the turkeys, Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson), must first learn to get along and put aside their differences.  Reggie is a smart, although a rather lazy and weak turkey, while Jake is a strong and brave turkey, but very dumb.  This duo makes for some great comedy!  Then a female turkey that Reggie has a crush on makes it even funnier!  This role of Jenny is voiced by the very funny Amy Poehler, which could not have been cast any better. The director, Jimmy Hayward, also directed ""Horton Hears a Who!""  He is also known for his work on ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc.,"" and many more great animated hits.  The soundtrack for ""Free Birds"" is also great. My favorite scene in this movie is when Jake rescues a bunch of baby turkeys, chicks, from a blazing fire.  These adorable, tiny puffballs are clinging to his feathers, and looking up at this massive hero with huge eyes.  It is just too cute!  ""Free Birds"" is a family movie that is great for all ages.  I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.  So don't miss out!  Go see this movie when it opens at theaters near you on Nov. 3rd. Reviewed by Molly J., KIDS FIRST!

6105587,1,B00GRZPQX8,"If you saw the trailer you saw 90% of the funniest moments in the film.  This storyline was very slow to develop, painfully slow, to the point that the kids were ready to go early on in the film, but hung on in hopes of a good ending.  It never came.  Additionally, it's a thinly veiled anti-poultry breeding/eating campaign, so buyer beware.  Personally, I felt this was out of place in what was billed a children's movie.  Needless to say this one I won't be added to our collection.",1389398400,7,485,4.404494382022472
