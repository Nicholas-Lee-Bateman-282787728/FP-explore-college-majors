8493371,2,B0065HDLOE,"Some people say comedy is culturally specific.  A comic hit in one country could flop in another.  This didn't have me on the floor cracking up, but I understood the humor.  It wasn't completely Greek to me.
I am fascinated by the idea of person-of-color unity.  The cover drew me in because it has one Black dude, one East Asian dude, and one Arab guy.  Off the top of my head, Ive never seen any DVD cover with a Black man, a LatinO, and an Asian guy on the cover of American CDs.  (Ive only seen an image like that in HIV/AIDS ads and Dr. John Longres book Men of Color.)  Also, the title uses the French term beur.  I don't know if thats a widely used term, a term Arab French only use for themselves, or a possible epithet.  In general, I think beurs are killer hot.  See the adult actor Franc,ois Sagat for an example.  However, the beur main character here is so odd-looking that one child equates him to Shrek.  You might think of Steve Buscemis description in Fargo when you see him.  Sadly, this DVD lacks any hot beur guys in it.
Ethnic issues aside, this is a standard cop comedy.  This is like Inspector Gadget or Who Is Harry Crumb?  Its the typical plot where the bumbling, incompetent police officer shows he has a heart of gold and can solve murder mysteries.  Further, this flick also reminded me of Scooby-Doo.  Very quickly, I figured who the surprise villain(ess) when I saw how much she has lines although she seems marginal to the plot.
Jean Claude van Damme fans may want to see this.  Hes here, but not as a good guy.  His character used many homophobic terms and it made me uncomfortable as a viewer, even though I don't think promoting bigotry was the goal of the film.  I say a Utube clip in which van Damme spoke about this film in very, very halting French.  He didn't seem as unskilled here.  However, it is not stated whether his character if French or a Dutchman who moved to France.  The fact that hes in cheesy French film, rather than well-financed Hollywood fodder, may be a sign that hes in his decline.
I never knew that a comedic version of La Haine would be created.  Still, if you want to crack up a little at a predictable, foreign comedy, then this is for you.",1419984000,,2204,4.345588235294118
