8257419,5,B00153NOQS,"The Invisible Enemy is an excellent classic!

One of the quintessential Doctor Who stories, I would say in the Top 10.
This story is wildly comic bookish Sci-Fi fun! You have to see it to believe it.
Very inventive, creative and hilarious.
Pure genius entertainment.
The story is comprised of a number of elements or concepts that remind me of the films Fantastic Voyage and Forbidden Planet, also the SPACE:1999 TV series.
It's also a bit like a live action Hanna-Barbera cartoon with a Sid & Marty Krofft influence.
It's hard to put your finger on this much fun!
Louise Jameson is sublime and sexy as usual, everyone else including Tom Baker give outstanding performances as well.
It's hard to take a large crustacean type creature seriously but everyone does admirably.
This story is also the debut for K-9, the robot dog.
He plays his part very well, he is essential here.
The professor who created him has the last line of dialogue. When the Doctor and Leela dematerialize taking K-9 along he worries, ""I hope he is TARDIS trained....""

I can't say enough good things about The Invisible Enemy.
I wouldn't be without it!
An absolute Sci-Fi masterpiece that happens to be a Doctor Who production.

K-9 And Company is a sweet postcard for the lovely Elisabeth Sladen (1946-2011) and the year 1981.

It is great fun to see Sarah Jane and K-9 driving around in her little convertible while trying to solve a mystery, a bit like Nancy Drew, but the story is indulgent and weak unfortunately.
Slow paced and uneventful with the tired old British cliche of a satanic cult and its pagan shenanigans.
A bad start. So bad in fact a series was out of the question.
I can see why it would seem a good idea at the time.
The kids loved Sarah Jane and K-9 of course, but the story, the concept is the thing.
Too bad.

Like my other Doctor Who Import PAL format releases the live video segments have a matte finish making them look like film for whatever reason. Your results may vary.

Mono Audio, English subtitles.
The Invisible Enemy is DVD 9, dual layer, K-9 And Company is DVD 5, single layer.
A number of decent extras included on both discs.

Essential viewing for classic Who fans!",1497571200,,2181,4.605670103092783
