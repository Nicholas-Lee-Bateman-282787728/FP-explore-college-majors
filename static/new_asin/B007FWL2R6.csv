8515961,3,B007FWL2R6,"John Wayne 20 Movie Pack

This collection of mostly old monochrome movies from the 1930s stars John Wayne in his early acting days before he was one of the better known actors in Western movies. He also played in other movies. Many of the western movies of this era portrayed the struggles of small ranchers and farmers against the big landowners of that era. These stories are based on historical events mostly censored from schoolbooks. The Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming was the inspiration for many of these stories, as well as the Lincoln County War in New Mexico. These four single-sided DVDs are mostly `Budget pictures'. They are the equivalent of the TV shows of today. Wayne worked as a property man before he became an actor. Many of these movies were shown on TV in the early 1950s. Are they more entertaining than the current shows on TV? Mike Tomkies book ""Duke"" tells about his acting career.

8515963,4,B007FWL2R6,"This collection  has not been rerecorded like other Mill Creek John Wayne Collections and therefore the prints are somewhat better. The Desert Trail- Texas Terror- The Star Packer- The Man from Utah- Randy Rides Alone- and the American West of John Ford - are the best I've found in the countless copies I have viewed.  The Dawn Rider is the same print used by many more expensive companies for release.  They all  have a break-up of slight  magnitude in the 2nd to 4th minute of the film. The only better print I have found is Cold Vengeance (aka Dawn Rider) which is much better,but with a modified sound track which actually is pretty good. The remaining films  are available from other companies and somewhat better if not totally better",1355788800,6,741,4.705426356589148
