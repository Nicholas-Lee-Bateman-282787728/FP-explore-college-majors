8527925,1,B002AWJ8IG,"This series is a good, not great, series and usually has something to add to my knowledge; however, this Speed and Explosive Training DVD has nothing new and nothing that cannot be found in an elementary school's PE activity sheet.  There is no discussion of form or movement...just jump more he says. Then...jump some more, jump in a pattern, jump forward, jump backward, jump up, jump down.  Thanks for nothing.  Had the DVD been $4.99, I might have been OK with buying it, but at $40-$50...no way.",1470873600,,500,4.724137931034483
