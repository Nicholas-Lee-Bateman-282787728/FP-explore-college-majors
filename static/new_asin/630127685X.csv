8155626,5,630127685X,"A team of psychic investigators are brought to the ""House of Death"" in the English countryside where some years earlier a number of murders took place, all on one night.  There seems to be some discrepency on how many people were killed which leads to the parody of ""12 days of Christmas"" song (Five in a bed! Four were slashed, Three were shocked ...).  No joke is too cheap as our troupe satirizes many classics from Carrie to The Invisible Man, and even The Rocky Horror Picture Show!  Alas, Vincent Price has way too small a part in this film.",1202342400,3,547,4.45
