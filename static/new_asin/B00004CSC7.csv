I won't go into the plot, save to say that the myraid characters and the setting make it similar to an Agatha Christie book-- with very good special effects. That's right, the tape showcases some great special effects that even rival those of the original series! That shocked me.

Get this on tape if you can. I'm proud to own one and I realize there are very few left and none of them new. This goes to show that one should always keep a fully functioning vcr in their home. Why? Because there I so much product out there that was never transferred to DVD!

There are many actors from Doctor Who and Blake's 7 that fans will recognise, the slightly different take on the Sontarans was enjoyable, believable and worked well. The production values are surprisingly high.",1207180800,,310,4.7592592592592595
