>Good video and good instruction

>different then what I thought he didn't show too many actual traps but instead talked about the concept of trapping to further your understanding of the subject

Overall a good video to add to my knowledge but don't buy it thinking your going to be a trap master that's not the intention of the video, buy it thinking it has some good general knowledge to fill in some gaps.",1349136000,2,593,4.324324324324325
