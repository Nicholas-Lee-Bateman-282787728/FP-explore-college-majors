2920204,5,B000UCH6S2,"once again, the filmography of 1999-2006 did not fail to show gackt's wonderful music videos.^^ just as perfect as the blue, the red gave me 12 beautiful songs in clear picture and sound with subtitles. wonderful for you fans out there who enjoy him as much as i do.^^",1201046400,,268,4.489795918367347
2920205,3,B000UCH6S2,"I am a great fan of Gackt's work.  Gackt is obsessive about quality and his concert DVDs are miles above typical Jrock concert videos from other artists. As such, it is distressing to see such a slipshod repackaging of his music videos, particularly since these are the first Gackt DVDs to be marketed specifically to a U.S. audience and folks new to this artist may get the wrong idea about the overall quality of his work.

The box indicates that these videos are ""16:9 anamorphic widescreen,"" but most of the videos themselves have hard-coded letterbox bars on top and bottom. This makes it hard for many people with 16:9 displays that lack a vertical zoom feature to see the videos in their correct aspect ratio (fat head syndrome). Moreover, even if one's display *can* do the requisite stretching, it is likely to cut off the subtitles.

These music videos, long available to hard-core fans through other channels, really needed to be remastered to be 16:9 anamorphic and with 5.1 surround sound, as are all of Gackt's concert videos except for ""Mars."" (Even Mars, his first concert DVD, has surround sound.)  The  music videos in this DVD fall far short of the audio and video quality of Gackt's concert videos, which are world-class in every respect, and which should be made available to U.S. audiences -- hopefully without the compromises we see here.",1197590400,7,1361,4.849137931034483
2920206,3,B000UCH6S2,"It's kind of a disappointment piece because both DVDs only contain music videos, and that's about it--and not even all of the videos Gackt's had done in the past 6-7 years either. It could have, at least, had him talking about his journal or something. No Gactk talking at all. I still love Gackt, though. But you can find all of those music videos on YouTube easily.",1194912000,3,367,4.492537313432836

2920208,5,B000UCH6S2,"This disc contains many of Gact's ballad oriented songs.  I have to say that Last Song is a killer, and the rest are almost as good.  The songs are subbed, with Japanese subs available.  Quite enteraining listening and viewing.  The price is quite good, also!  Gackt is now available to the masses!",1193356800,3,298,4.653846153846154
2920209,5,B000UCH6S2,"This disc contains many of Gackt's more hard rock oriented songs, althought they're mostly about love, regret and loss.  Mizerable is probably my favorite amognst the tracks, but they're all worth listening to and watching.  The songs are subbed in English, with Japanese subs available.  Those are the extras, pretty much.  Quite enjoyable and you can't really beat it for the price!",1193356800,6,384,5.145161290322581
2920210,4,B000UCH6S2,"I've been a fan of Gackt since 2002, so I was very excited to hear that Viz would be releasing these DVD's in the states (and at $19, instead of the $40 price typical of most imported J-Rock items). I couldn't find it in my local Fye or Suncoast, so I had to order from Amazon. I got my copy of ""Red"" in the mail today and watched the whole thing through. The Audio and Visual quality is stunning, this sure beats the heck outta watching pixelated PV's on Youtube! Though I do have some slight nitpicks.

There's no ""Romaji Singalong"" like most fansubs, the subtitles have the occasional jumbled sentence, and their interpretation of ""Mirror"" was a little... explicit. I guess it was Artistic Liberty or whatever. There's not much to look at in the paper sleeve, not even a ""Special Thanks"" section, just a list of the videos, who directed them and who was in them. There's no Special Features to be found. A video Interview with Gackt would've been a great way for him to address his adoring english-speaking audience. Either way smart move by Nippon Crown, I hope it gives Gackt more exposure.

I really hope that Viz will consider doing PV compilation sets like this for other popular J-Rockers such as MUCC, Gazette, and DIR EN GREY. Its nearly impossible to find J-Rock CD's or DVD's for less than $40, and when you do, quite often its a bootleg made in Taiwan or China (**cough-MiyaRecords-cough**) Official U.S. Re-releases like these are a great way of reaching fans, while also sidestepping the bootleggers... ^_^",1192665600,15,1522,4.675373134328358
2920211,4,B000UCH6S2,"I'll be straightforward. Gackt is not my favorite solo artist, but I do like his works.

When these DVDs first came out in Japan, I seriously considered buying them, but I simply couldn't justify that high of a cost for just... two Music video DVDs, at $40 EACH.

With these domestic releases, it's a very different story. $20 for higher-than-YouTube quality, subtitled (or not, if you choose) music videos. Between each video you get a quick little blurb about where it was filmed, who's in it, who did what, and it's all it's own track, separate from the proceeding video.

These are very nice releases, and I recommend them to any Gackt fan. Especially the Red one, because it focuses on his rock songs, not his ballads, which, after watching 12 in a row... get boring. ^^

But I do feel mildly let down, as there was almost nothing in the way of extras. Subtitles in English, that can be turned off, and I'm told that there are Japanese subtitles, but my DVD player wasn't so accommodating as to let me turn them on; as well as a Random Shuffle option. Nothing else. No pretty pictures in the pamphlet, no interviews, no behind the scenes, no gallery... Just the videos. For half the price of the Japanese release. ^_^",1192406400,5,1222,4.566210045662101
2920212,5,B000UCH6S2,"This is the American release of Gackt's Filmography. It has English subtitles and is playable on any Region 1 (America) DVD player.

Blue contains Gackt's quieter videos and three live acoustic recordings off one of the yearly Platinum box sets. All the videos are gorgeous. December Love Song (juunigatsu no love) is set in New York in November 2001. It is a beautiful video tribute to the lives lost in 9/11. You really shouldn't miss the piano version of Last Song. It is just Gackt and the piano. And finally I cried when I saw the last song on the DVD, Love Letter. It is a heartfelt song to his fans.

This is a video must for anyone who is a Gackt fan. It is definitely worth the price.",1191110400,13,693,4.364341085271318
2920213,5,B000UCH6S2,"I personally prefer collections of music videos to live concert footage, so when this collection and its pendant DVD ""Blue"" were released I set my DVD player to region 2 and sat back to enjoy the ride!  The songs on this DVD (ANOTHER WORLD, OASIS, Secret Garden, REDEMPTION, Mizrable, BLACK STONE, sekirei~seki-ray~, Vanilla, kimi ga oikaketa yume, Mirror, wasurenai kara, and Metamorphoze) are more energetic than the ones on ""Blue"", and the story in the videos seem to move along faster. If you discovered Gackt through games, videos of particular interest are REDEMPTION and Mizrable.  In REDEMPTION we get to see Gackt in his role of G from various ""Compilation of Final Fantasy VII"" titles, and in the video for Mizrable we get to see him looking like Alucard from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  For Gundam fans, there's Metamorphoze, which features Gackt as a Gundam pilot in battle and scenes from the anime.  I also really enjoyed BLACK STONE's video for its high energy, and OASIS for the creativity of body movements and how Gackt sort of ""creeps"" into the frame in some shots.  All the other videos are equally enjoyable. An awesome collection overall!",1191110400,22,1169,4.9438775510204085
2920214,5,B000UCH6S2,"As a foreign fan of GACKT, I was happy enough just to have this. Really, I'm not much of a music video person. But with Gackts stuff, it's different. It seems enough of a privelidge just to get a regular Japanese release. This, unlike most of his vids, includes English subs. It includes various vids that fans have probably already seen. But this tangible item is English speaker friendly. That's a major plus. I'd be willing to pay a lot more for his stuff if they all had English subs. The price of this is less than half of the regular Japanese release. Usually import stuff is outrageously more expensive. And 'special edition' (e.g. foreign language subs) are even pricier for obvious reasons. However, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Ultimately, you get the best part: the videos. But, unlike almost everything GACKT releases, this packaging is lacking. GACKT usually has something special about even just the case itself for everything he releases. THIS is just your standard plain ol' DVD case. You get the DVD and the cover art with that. That's it. If I am anything like any other GACKT fan, this is understandably disappointing. It's all that extra that he works so hard to put into each release that makes it all the more special. If you don't mind not having all the extra stuff and just want the vids (or at least a copy of them with subs) then this will be just right. This would probably also be good for the fairly newer fans. Especially $-wise. It's a good place to start to help you decide whether you want to further invest into the addictive world of the egoist Mr. SSSSSSS....",1327363200,,1613,4.56551724137931
2920215,2,B000UCH6S2,"The technical description and the DVD case itself both say this is 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, but this is not the case. The videos are 1.33:1 or widescreen footage embedded within a 1.33:1 screen.

As for the music videos themselves, they are excellent.",1312243200,,254,5.0476190476190474

2920217,5,B000UCH6S2,"Gackt: The Greatest Filmography 1999-2006- Blue (the DVD) was perfect, just as I expected. This compilation has slower, more relaxed songs compared to the Red version and has some beautiful lives. In fact, at this price, the DVD would have been worth it even if the only performance on here was Mirror -Unplugged- (it was pricelessly fun!). So 5 stars for the actual product.
For the packaging, though... 2 stars. You'd think that they'd put Red and Blue in the same kind of DVD case, but they don't. Blue got the short end of the stick with one of those cases that doesn't actually have plastic behind where the product goes- just paper and a few plastic strips to keep the center button connected to the rest of the case. This means the DVD is more suseptible to damage and the case generally looks cheaper. Also, the cover art (paper insert) for Blue looks grainy compared to Red's. Manufacturer, WHAT IS UP WITH THIS?
Anyway, heed the warning on the packaging, but the DVD is GREAT, so the product still gets 5/5 stars, if a mite reluctantly.",1296086400,,1046,4.598930481283422
2920218,5,B000UCH6S2,"When I received my DVD of Gackt I opened it and watched it. I enjoyed it and I loved how they had the english translations, they could have done a better job but it was still worth the money. I spoiled myself and bought both. I would recommend it to anyone. Gackt is a talented artist he has a voice the just speaks to you even though it is not in your native language.",1272499200,,369,4.0

2920220,5,B000UCH6S2,"I just received this for my birthday both Red and Blue. I love both of them to death, very visually stunning and he has such a beautiful voice! I would recommend this to ANY Gackt fan! Thank you!",1224115200,,195,4.157894736842105
2920221,5,B000UCH6S2,"Although Gackt's Blue filmography is excellent, the Red takes the cake. Including the pv's for ""Redemption"", ""Vanilla"", and ""Mizerable"", Red offers up the more rock-oriented songs that Gackt has offered up over the years. Twelve gorgeously produced music videos with English subtitles are presented with excellent quality.
  this DVD offers up hard rock songs (Redemption), and also a slightly softer, more playful sound as well (Black Stone). This DVD, as well as the Blue, is an essential piece in any Jrock fan's collection. I was more than pleased with my copy!",1220659200,,565,5.197802197802198
2920222,5,B000UCH6S2,Red is a marvelous collection of music videos. I was really impressed with this. Go buy it and see for yourself!,1202515200,,112,4.380952380952381
2920223,5,B000UCH6S2,"This DVD is a wonderful investment for any Gackt fan, or anyone curious on seeing a bit more of him. The pricetag is also very nice compared to original Japanese.

It includes many of his more fast-paced songs. The graphic quality is great and the feature to turn the subtitles on and off was a relief to me.

When it comes to the subtitles I was at first worried. VIZ isn't exactly my first choice when it comes to translators. However, upon further investigation I found that Gackt himself actually did most the work on the translations to the songs. I think this is brilliant. Though the translations aren't always totally literal, I believe they then give his insight into the lyrics when they are in English.

Wonderful buy.",1201996800,2,729,4.635658914728682

8212875,5,B000UCH6S2,"If you like Gackt this DVD is great - contains his MV.  Some of his MV are ok, but the music and his singing is always great!  I decided to get this DVD because it has his faster songs.  It has subtitles which I really like so I can understand what the song is about.  Some of the lines might be off but it's not bad.  Much better than most internet subs.  I really like his live performances so hope to buy some DVDs of his concerts.  Right now I have to watch them on the internet and the quality is not that good.  The DVD came quickly and in good condition.  I love amazon.",1382400000,,577,3.9478260869565216

8212882,5,B000UCH6S2,"This is an awesome collection of some of Gackts best videos. It's quite low priced compared to most Japanese media. If you're looking for some of the more favorite of Gs vids, add this to your cart. Unless you're a new fan, you've probably seen all these videos time and again. Probably, you've even purchased them in another release at some point. But, this one is a little different. What makes this so special is the English subtitles. You can find fan-subbed stuff online sometimes. That's great. But this is apparently the 'official' translations from GACKT and/or his team/company themselves. (Don't hold that against me if I'm wrong). But as for 'special', that's the only identifier. Of course, his work is awesome and that's plenty enough reason to buy. But for those English speaking fans stricken with language barrier, I cannot stress enough how nice it is to have this. I got both Red & Blue at the same time. For both, I highly recommend taking advantage of. However, there's a matter of packaging (for both Red& Blue). The casing and extras just aren't there. It's not like the typical GACKT stuff. Usually he has somewhat special (ecclectic?) style. Usually, even the packaging itself is just full of awesome. But this is just plain. It's only a standard case & and simple cover art. You get the DVD only. No pics, no booklet, no cool case...nothing extra. But that's what you're paying for. If you are just looking for an English friendly copy to add to your collection or if you're a new fan, this is a good buy.",1327363200,,1530,4.691449814126394
