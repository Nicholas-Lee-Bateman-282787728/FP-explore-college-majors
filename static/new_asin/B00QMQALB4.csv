6876531,5,B00QMQALB4,Fantastic portrait of a almoust forgotten guitar player.,1425427200,,56,6.125
6876532,4,B00QMQALB4,"As usual with musical biographies, one always longs for more music and less talk. Definitely a Woody Mann movie since he gets the majority of non RGD material. Would have liked at least one performance from Ernie Hawkins , for me the master of Gary's style. Nonetheless overall well done, and some priceless footage of Gary at or near the top of his game, Newport for instance. A true American master !!!",1425081600,,404,4.625
6876533,5,B00QMQALB4,"This is a loving tribute to Rev. Davis by many of his students.  While Davis was an incredible player and singer (his influence went from the East Coast folk movement to the Jefferson Airplane and the Dead), the filmmakers try and tell us a bit of the man.  The film documents stories from Davis' birth in the 1890s to his death in the early 70s. it's a great story of mastery, survival, success, faith and character.  The film consists of pictures, stories, and music.

Lots of music.

Many of Rev, Davis' songs are covered tastefully by his students.  There is also footage of Davis' performances.

Like the best in many areas, Davis' music was not really for popular tastes.  As the second worst student of Davis' self-confessed second worst student, I'm still proud to be part of the Rev.'s line!

The extras are great.  More music, interviews, and a workshop on Davis' playing by Woody Mann.

WHY FIVE STARS: I'm not much for giving out five starts anymore, but this is a story and legacy that needs preserving.  The film is clearly through the eyes of admirers and takes a reverent, though quite human, look at this American legend.  It's fun, informative, and entertaining.",1424131200,,1180,4.7254901960784315
6876534,5,B00QMQALB4,Thank you so much Woody and Trevor for this too short documentary.  Long overdue look at the Reverend's life and musical influence.  When I watched the first time I knew that I was looking at a labor of love.  It's amazing how many folks where taught by and influenced by Rev. Davis.,1423267200,,283,4.403846153846154
6876535,5,B00QMQALB4,Great documentary about a great man and revolutionary guitarist.  Davis has been an inspiration to many!,1423180800,,104,5.5
6876536,3,B00QMQALB4,There are many who know more about the Rev Gary Davis than I but I waited forever to see this. I even contemplated going to one of their premieres in a different city. I'm glad I didn't. While I applaud the effort that went into this dvd the extras were where I definitely felt I got my dollar's worth. Wouldn't have seen those extras at the premeires. Woody Mann was a serious student. Thank you for that and documenting the journey.,1421020800,5,434,4.37037037037037
6876537,5,B00QMQALB4,"Later edit of original review; I wrote the review below based on having seen a preview copy of this DVD several months ago. Now that I've seen the commercial product, I wanted to comment on the excellence of the ""special features"" which have been added. These include a number of more extensive interviews with cultural figures from the guitar world who are featured in the film, and some who are not. In addition, producer Woody Mann has included a number of audio tapes of his own lessons with the Reverend, allowing an intimate listen to what it was like to be in Rev. Davis's living room in the sixties. This stuff alone is worth the price of admission.
One other thing I'd add, after numerous viewings in the past week or so, is that, beyond revealing the Reverend's remarkable artistic expertise and integrity, the documentary portrays the incredible obstacles that Rev. Davis managed to surmount in his lifetime. It is a true ""rags to riches"" story of how an impoverished, blind, black man from rural South Carolina rose out of poverty to become a cultural icon to a whole generation of young guitarists. The ""riches"" are not monetary wealth, in that the Reverend probably only ever attained ""middle class"" status in that regard, but the spiritual, musical, and personal riches he attained are prodigious. Here's my original review:
=====
I was able to view a preview copy of this disc a while back, and immediately purchased it last night when I learned it's available on Amazon. If you already know who Rev. Gary Davis is, you'll want to own this DVD. If not, this is an excellent documentary about one of the two greatest ragtime blues guitarists every to pick up the instrument. The film amply shows how substantially Reverend Davis influenced guitarists who came up during the 50s, 60s, and after, and many of the best of these, including Stefan Grossman, Jorma Kaukenon, Roy Bookbinder, and David Bromberg speak lovingly about his teaching and playing. There's also plenty of archival footage of the reverend's virtuoso playing and singing. This film is a must for any fan of country and ragtime blues styles, and great background material for fans of groups who carried his influence: a crew as diverse as the Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna, Peter, Paul, & Mary, the David Bromberg Band, and more. Rev. Gary Davis was a much beloved figure and a man of great spirit. Buy the film and see for yourself!! Disclaimer: While I had nothing to do with the production of this film, I was fortunate to have met and learned from the Reverend in the late sixties, and can personally ""testify"", as can hundreds of other professional musicians, as to the transformative power of his music and person.",1419897600,15,2695,4.797849462365591

6876544,5,B00QMQALB4,"I knew of Gary Davis' music prior to purchasing the film, but little about the man himself.  The film is an excellent in depth portrayal of Gary Davis from the many people who knew and worked with him.  Many studied under him.  I had not realized the impact Davis had on the music we all take for granted.  A great and illuminating film.",1434931200,,337,4.301587301587301
6876545,5,B00QMQALB4,"I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS FILM!!! First and foremost, what an incredible journey the Rev had.......... Secondly, what a beautiful piece of filmmaking, and what an outstanding tribute. Way to go, Trevor and Woody, and THANK YOU!!!",1434326400,,228,5.1891891891891895
6876546,5,B00QMQALB4,"I am a relative newcomer to the music of Rev. Gary Davis:  prior to 2012, I doubt I'd ever heard any recordings of him playing his own music.  But that year, while taking my first steps toward learning how to play fingerstyle guitar, I discovered that the instructors from whom I was learning how to play all seemed to revere Rev. Davis; and their own covers of his songs were some of the most involving performances I'd seen/heard in recent years.  So I started listening to him on YouTube, and then buying recordings.  In the time since, I've become increasingly a fan of his playing and his music.  I separate the two -- his playing, and his music -- because they deserve plaudits independently of each other.  You don't see him in ""greatest"" lists compiled by popular music magazines like Rolling Stone; but I promise you that's because of the compilers' ignorance.  (After all, their lists of ""The 100 Greatest __(fill in the blank here)___ of All-Time"" always seem to go no further back than 1955 or so; were there really no great recordings earlier in the century, or no great compositions or musicians in all of human history before then?)  Rev. Gary Davis was one of the true geniuses of the guitar, and guitarists operating within the sphere of ""traditional"" music know this.  His sense of rhythm; his mastery of the fretboard; his combination of fluid bass lines, fast and intricate melody lines, and unusual (and absurdly hard to learn) chord voicings; all make his playing a delight to listen to.  And yet that technique never feels like an end to itself:  his playing was in service of his music; and while I know this part is subjective, I think his music was profoundly inspiring.  Most of what he recorded was of a Christian spiritual nature, and I'm a non-believer, so I'm pre-disposed to intensely dislike this sort of music.  But instead, when the Reverend sings of salvation in ""Oh Glory How Happy I Am!"", I want to get up and sing too.

I guess that's a fairly long-winded advertisement for Rev. Gary Davis' music:  I like it, and I think other people should too.  But it also serves as some sort of ""Full Disclosure"" about this review, I guess:  I'm probably predisposed to like this documentary about Rev. Gary Davis, his life, and his music.  But at the same time, my affection for the subject matter also means that it matters to me that this film be done well, and not simply done.  Well, it's done well.  Woody Mann and Company did a great job with this.

The film covers his whole life, and is invaluable in what it tells us about the conditions and situations Rev. Davis faced when younger; but understandably concentrates on his time in New York City because that's the time of his life we know the most about.  It includes contributions from a vast array of members of the 60s NYC-based folk/rock community, including both those who studied with the Reverend and those who did not but still were strongly influenced by him or incorporated some of his music into their repertoires.  It moves him from the position of legendary figure to the position of human being by recounting tales of little episodes that illustrate his quirkiness, while simultaneously fleshing out that ""legendary figure"" status through the words of more famous musicians who place credit where due.  And the pitfalls of many documentaries don't really appear here:  the telling of the story never feels dry; the content never seems to get so down-in-the-weeds that only someone already a fan could really get much out of it.

As other reviewers have noted, the DVD extras include some of Woody Mann's audio recordings of lessons with the Reverend.  Also included are some performances by an ensemble that's seen/heard covering the Reverend's music at various points in the documentary, a performance of a tune *about* Reverend Gary Davis by Roy Book Binder played on a porch at Jorma Kaukonen's Fur Peace Ranch, and some video footage of the Reverend playing (which appears to be sync'ed to a separate audio recording that oddly might not be from the same performance, as you sometimes hear Rev. Davis singing when in the video his mouth isn't moving).  There's also a little footage from one of Woody Mann's workshops about Rev. Davis' music.

My only unfulfilled wish:  I would have liked a bit more content relating to the Reverend's preaching and ministry in NYC.  Again, I'm a non-believer:  but it was of paramount importance to him, so it's obviously important to the telling of his story.  This was certainly covered in the film, but I would have liked more.  Maybe the filmmakers were constrained here by limited material?  The film contained some audio recordings of the Reverend's preaching in an NYC storefront church:  those audio recordings may be amongst those previously released on the multi-disc _Reverend Gary Davis:  At Home and At Church_, released by Stefan Grossman's label.  If so, it's possible that the filmmakers couldn't include much more such content, or any video, because it doesn't exist.  I don't know.

There's a big industry behind a lot of the music we're exposed to; and in service to that industry, we are presented with a lot of stories about *product*:  manufactured music by manufactured performers.  This is a story about the real thing.",1430611200,4,5283,4.805094130675526
6876547,5,B00QMQALB4,"If you've loved the Rev.'s music, as I have, for over four decades, and been blessed by the efforts of Woody, Stefan, Roy, Jorma, Ernie, et. al., to spread the good news, you will play this dvd over and over.  Not only is the documentary itself great, but the special features are a treasure trove of endless delight.  This whole package is wonderful, whether as introduction to this seminal figure, or as a celebration of his legacy for those already very familiar.",1428624000,,466,4.670731707317073

This Dvd sheds more light on these points and it proves be accessible to most people, not just musicians.
Simply: a relevant document on American History.",1492905600,,332,5.283018867924528
8691945,5,B00QMQALB4,I sure enjoyed this DVD! It's packed with information and interviews from folks whose lives were touched by the Reverend Gary Davis. I followed him in the 1960's and am a long time admirer of his guitar playing and his music!,1487548800,,225,4.512195121951219
8691946,5,B00QMQALB4,"This was an ideal time for me to revisit a time many fundamental concepts came from. The DVD is about a Black blind street singer who had been arrested a few times for pulling a gun when he thought people were going to be robbed. The people who tell about events had strong feelings about being around a blind person who had pulled out a gun. The song that makes the deepest impression on me, If I Had My Way, tells the story of Samson and a lion, Samson and Delilah, and I would tear this building down. I heard Peter, Paul, and Mary put energy into the recording on their first album, which was a top ten best-seller for a long time. I did not know Reverend Gary Davis had written a Candyman song that seems to be the basis for what I learned from an early Donovan record. Sometimes suggestions about intoxication are suicidal invitations to an early grave.

Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead gives full credit to Reverend Gary Davis for the way he sang and played Samson and Delilah (It I Had My Way) for Grateful Dead concerts. The spirit of fury reminds me of reading about pathology is wild marauders out for a night on the town in the book Eat Right 4 Your Type by Peter D""Adamo, a graduate of the first class of naturopathic physicians from Bastyr University, Seattle, Washington (p. 311 of the 1996 first edition). Harlem Street Singer documents the deterioration of reverend Gary Davis at the end of his life. Drinking alcohol can take some minds to a spoonaverse that can reveal itself to others in music and performance. At the end of life, the use of alcohol can be as destructive as eating food with the kind of lectins that destroys the ability to digest what a habit of eating too much of the same thing has saturated immune system interaction with digestive health. Even the world is in danger of suicidal impulses that seem to impel everything to whatever doom awaits us. On pages 212-13:

A high-fat diet, smoking
and alcohol consumption
create the ideal environment
for digestive cancers.

Great risk if there is a
family history of colon cancer.

In China, Japan, and Korea,
a stomach cancer epidemic

and fermented foods.

Watch out for nitrates.

When death comes knocking at your door, it has no mercy. It will take your mother, and everybody you know. We lost the best friend we ever had.",1486166400,,2336,4.536817102137767
