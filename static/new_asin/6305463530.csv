1031006,5,6305463530,"This is another gem from Jack Hill. I thoroughly enjoyed it. All Jack Hill's movies were made to be fun and this is no exception.

Getting into plot details in an Amazon review isn't my thing, but I'll just say that this movie doesnt turn out the way one might expect. Hill seems to enjoy pitching curve balls to an audience; leading them in one direction only to suprise them with plot twists.

The DVD is well done overall, with good special features and a clean widescreen print. I always enjoy listening to Jack Hill speak on his films, although I could do without this Johnny Legend character that accompanies him on this audio commentary.

In short; another must for your Jack Hill DVD collection!",1269302400,4,703,4.608
1031007,4,6305463530,"I saw this film as part of a Cheerleader triple feature with my husband, then boyfriend at the local drive-in theater. It was the only film to have a plot and to hold my interest. In addition, it had a talented cast, my favorites being Colleen Camp and Rainbeaux Smith. The story is not deep, but then again, this movie doesn't pretend to make a big political statement or address social issues. It is just mindless campy fun from the 1970's, with some sex thrown in. It reminds me of an adult cartoon, and has been referred to by Director Jack Hill as a ""Disney Sex Comedy."" The picture quality is excellent and crisp, which really brings out the cartoonish, artificial look of the sets. (Jack Hill shot this film in 12 days, so you're not looking at a big budget production.) The men's feathered haircuts are especially hilarious, and be sure to check out the psychedelic wallpaper in the Star Jock's apartment. The DVD includes Director's Commentary which is just as interesting as the movie itself, plus the 30-second and 60-second trailers. This film is considered the best of the ""B-Movie"" cheerleader genre and is a great ""cabin fever"" movie to watch over and over again. For those of you baby boomers who saw this film in a drive-in, it will be a nostalgic reminder of your teenage years.",992736000,17,1296,4.639130434782609
1031008,1,6305463530,"If you like watching cheerleaders, then this might be the ticket for you;  however, Bring it On was much more entertaining.
The movie has a weak  plot about a girl who infiltrates a cheerleading squad for a newspaper  story.  This is the kind of movie that you watch at 3:00 a.m. on Cable TV  when you can't sleep.  I have a sneaking suspecion that this movie did not  last long on the screen.  The only real star in the movie is Collene Camp,  who could be called one of best B movie queens (I think this was one of her  first movies).  However, even she could not bring life to this bad movie.",969148800,5,595,4.176991150442478
7889532,2,6305463530,"This is a really bad movie, but kind of funny. It definitely speaks to a certain aspect of B-movie culture in the 1970s. This is the kind of movie that presumably teens would have gone to see at the $2/carload drive-in, in Roseville. Although at that time, I was too young to have been taken to see that one. We would have been watching more of a kids movie at that theater, on a different night. I was unaware that this kind of low-budget college titty movie even existed, then. it wasn't until the 1980s, when I was a teen, that I saw my first of these kinds of movies with bare breasts and shallow metaphors for the politics of the war in Vietnam, with Porky's.  :)",1504396800,,668,4.25984251968504
7889533,4,6305463530,"I hate to say it, but Ive had The Swinging Cheerleaders Blu-ray sitting in my backlog for quite a while now. My site usually focuses on horror, if you haven't already noticed, so I never got the time to pop the flick in. Nonetheless, I figured seeing how I did get it for review, I should probably watch it and last night was the right time to do just that. All the other movies I have left to review, require a couple of days of work to get through, but The Swinging Cheerleaders, on the other hand, wouldnt take very long, as the special features aren't overly long and the movie itself is a quick 91 minutes. Was the wait worth it? Grab a cheerleader and prepare to find out.

MOVIE REVIEW

At first, I was not entirely sure what type of genre I would lump The Swinging Cheerleaders into, however, after checking out drive-in history, you will see that there was a string of Cheerleader drive-in classics like THE CHEERLEADERS (1973) and REVENGE OF THE CHEERLEADERS (1976). I suppose The Swinging Cheerleaders is part of that lesser known (to me) Cheerleader genre. Also, having Jack Hill as the director, who you may know from such hits as Switchblade Sisters and Coffy, gives the film a strong female lead and a bit of a blacksploitation vibe. It most certainly isn't the raunchy movie I thought it was going to be, based on the title. There are a few scenes of female nudity thrown in to please fans, as was necessary for the time, but the film plays it rather tame.

The movie does have a bit of a funny bone running throughout, with an ending that turns everything into complete slapstick comedy, which might throw off the viewers, as the rest of the film wasn't as in your face with the comedy as the ending was. Im talking Three Stooges level of comedy here.

Nevertheless, The Swinging Cheerleaders has a strong female lead in Jo Johnston, who is a sight for sore eyes and carries the film. She is tough as nails and gets shit done, even if some of the shit she has to do is sleeping with the quarterback for research purposes. Also, I would be remiss in not mentioning my Clue crash Colleen Camp, who plays the mean head Cheerleader with such zeal.

The Swinging Cheerleaders resulted in a fun flick that had bits of comedy (slapstick, etc.), nudity and a few scenes that played rather serious. Jack Hill once again had another hit on his hands with this one.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Arrow Video takes yet another older film and lovingly restores it to its former glory. The films video quality is rather nice, with nice even film grain and an audio presentation that keeps things loud and clear. There are moments of choppy film and scenes transition that are rather jarring, but that comes down to the film negative used and is no fault of Arrow Video.

The special features on The Swinging Cheerleaders might seem like a lot at first, but once you start to crack into them, youll notice that most of them only run around the 8 to 10-minute mark, with the New Beverly Cinema Q & A being the longest at nearly 20 minutes. Of course, there is the much welcome audio commentary with Jack Hill that is worth a listen.

VERDICT

The Swinging Cheerleaders was a nice detour from the realm of horror and into the lesser known Cheerleader genre that Im just finding out about now. Ive loved Jack Hills previous flicks, so I knew I would at least get some enjoyment out of this one and I was most definitely right. The Arrow Video Blu-ray has been out for some time now, but if you haven't checked it out yet and are curious, you won't regret picking it up.",1487808000,,3556,4.4569230769230765

Im not sure that I actually saw this film at the drive-in, where movies like this were a constant staple, but I did see a few like it. All of them seemed to have on goal in mind, to take the tops off of eager young women. At least thats the only thing I thought they were about back then. I found most poorly made and boring. But in watching this one I was surprised that there was actually a decent movie here although one made with a nearly non-existent budget.

The story here revolves around the cheerleading squad at Mesa State. Kate (Jo Johnston) is the reporter for an underground newspaper on campus (face it all universities had them in the late 60s/early 70s). To get the gritty on the cheerleaders and how they are being taken advantage of by the team and alumni she goes undercover and becomes one of them. What she doesnt count on is discovering that they are just normal young women like here and that not all of the jocks are the jerks she assumed they were.

She also didn't consider the fact she might find love with star quarterback Buck Larson (Ron Hajek). Buck is already involved with the head cheerleader Mary Ann (Colleen Camp) whose father is the most influential member of the alumni around. To cross her might mean the end of his scholarship. But this isn't the worst of the problems faced here.

There is cheerleader Lisa who is romantically involved with her Professor Thorpe, her math teacher. They two plan to run off together as soon as he divorces his wife. Then there is Andrea, a virginal young cheerleader who cant quite seem to commit to a sexual involvement with her boyfriend who she dearly loves. We are also presented with a problem involving Thorpe, Mary Anns father and the coach who are gambling on the team to make big bucks, so much so that the coach is willing to throw the game to advance their position.

Kates editor is a pot smoking radical who wants to do nothing less that stick it to the man. When she begins to see that things aren't what they thought he doesnt take kindly to her new viewpoint. When Andrea goes to the newspapers office to talk to her shes not there but he is. Taking out his frustration he rapes Andrea.

The feminist viewpoints on display here, the sexual revolution that discusses both end of the scale from random sex to commitment, the discovery that the straights aren't as straight as thought and the radicals aren't nearly as progressive as they pain themselves all combine here to make an honest to goodness movie rather than a simple T&A drive-in flick. Yes, some of the jokes fall flat and are corny, yes the sets leave much to be desired at times, yes the acting ranges from solid to ludicrous but in the end the movie ends up being, well, a decent little movie. It has an actual story even if it is dropped down the most simplistic possible. But when you're shooting a movie in 12 days intended to do more than titillate teens what do you expect? That something good came from that is the most amazing thing.

The Arrow Video release of this film is jam packed with goodies, like almost everything they are bringing out on blu-ray these days. Ive hailed them for their quality product time and again and this time is no different. The movie looks beautiful on screen using the best possible print they could find. Extras include an audio commentary track with director Jack Hill made just for this release, a brand new interview with director Jack Hill, an archive interview with cinematographer Alfred Taylor, an archive interview with Jack Hill and Johnny Legend, a Q&A with Hill and actors Colleen Camp and Roseanne Katon recorded at the New Beverly Cinema in 2012, TV spots and a reversible sleeve featuring artwork by Graham Humphreys.

If you have fond memories of going to the drive-in then by all means youll want to add this one to your collection. It turns out to be more fun than you would expect and a better movie than most in the genre offer.",1473811200,5,3997,4.518672199170124
7889538,4,6305463530,"The 1974 cult film The Swinging Cheerleaders was not the first (nor the last) of the films released (mostly to drive-ins) that year. But it had the best credentials and actually had a story line and a moral. The Director  Jack Hill  had made Pam Grier a star in Foxy Brown  and made other powerful women films. So, though this might look like a Debbie Does Dallas kind of film, it neither features graphic sex or a dumb script. But its not brilliant either. What makes this release worth watching is that, not only does the print  remastered from the 35mm print Hill salvaged before it was destroyed, but the fact that its got lots of bonus features including a full commentary from Hill, and few interviews with him and a Q&A with Hill and two of the actresses (including a really heavy Coleen Camp!) . It even has optional English subtitles for the deaf and hearing-impaired Arrow gave this its version of the Criterion Editions.

The package includes BOTH a BD and DVD to get a wider audience.

If you remember the film and want to see it again, or want to know more about Hill and is work, this is worth picking up. Of course if you are looking for something racier than topless women (and topless men of course) or graphic sex (things go to black when couples get it on, then you might find it boring.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7889539,3,6305463530,"Jack Hill is one of those directors that it is really hard to get a grasp where his heads at from one film to the next. The man has made his bread and butter on focusing on women in some sort of power. Pam Grier, Joanne Nail and many other females often credit Jack for what he did for them. His history has gone from horror to focusing on the power of the female species without ever changing much about his style. This film focuses on Kate who goes to Mesa University who goes undercover as a cheerleader to expose the plight of females and also showcase exploitation that is happening. As you can guess with these films instead of finding bad things, she instead finds love, and a corrupt football team. This film for what it is and the era it represents is a fun little film. It is serious at times, but does not take itself serious at all.

The film has a fun vibe that makes the material very easy to want to follow. I can see why Tarantino sees this as such a classic in his eyes. Arrow does a great service to the blu ray, and the picture and sound is flat out amazing and on my smart television looks very good. This film some could say in the 70s both mainstream and porn had a fixation with the cheerleader and football player aspect of film. You had films like Debbie Does Dallas and High School Memories, then you had on the other hand North Dallas Forty which was a football film at its core, Semi Tough and so many more I know I will hate myself for forgetting. This film has enough going for it that people will sit back and enjoy what unfolds on the big screen, but this film does at time become a victim of its own devices and does seem to drag at moments and at others is not intense enough. This being said though, it is well worth checking out at least once in your life.",1467763200,,1792,4.164265129682997
7889540,4,6305463530,"If you're looking for one unintended positive side-effect of the proliferation of internet porn, at least we can hang our collective hats on this:  all those drive-in T&A double-features of the '70s look almost puritanical by comparison.  Roger Corman's Student Nurses launched a whole wave of now-innocuous skin flicks, most of them becoming progressively more single-mindedly titillating, drifting further and further afield from the original's overly earnest soap-opera antics.  But leave it to director Jack Hill, whose career is hopelessly intertwined with Corman's, to follow in his mentor's footsteps, turning his own Nurses knock-off into a stealthy critique on female empowerment.

That's certainly not what you'd expect with a title like The Swinging Cheerleaders.  Rest assured, most of the female cast goes topless at one point or another.  But it's rarely staged in a callous or exploitative fashion, hewing much closer to the format Fast Times at Ridgemont High used to mix nudity and naughty behavior with real life lessons.  In fact, Kate (Jo Johnston), our plucky lead character, joins the squad as an undercover journalist writing an expose on how the sport demeans women, in much the same way Cameron Crowe's uncover high school gig got the dirt on classmates in the Rolling Stone article Ridgemont was based upon.

It's fiction influencing real life influencing fiction.  (Cue Sean Penn hitting himself on the skull with a shoe.)

But The Swinging Cheerleaders actually takes things a step further, toying with the pre-conceived notions of jocks as brainless bullies and campus revolutionaries as peace-loving nerds.  The screenplay (written by Hill but disguised under a pair of female pseudonyms to capitalize once again on Roger Corman's habit of hiring women writers and directors preemptively deflect criticism) turns the tables, revealing the ""big men on campus"" to be honorable gentle giants while the Dylan-esque radical winds up a loathsome rapist.

The girls on the squad (including Rainbeaux Smith who carried on the torch in Revenge of the Cheerleaders and The Pom Pom Girls) juggle their fair share of melodramatic problems interrupted by a few romantic encounters...which themselves are usually interrupted by a chaste fade to black.  If it all sounds like some sort of intellectual experiment, just wait until the tacked on slapstick finale.  Hill knows he still has an audience to entertain and makes sure he doesn't bore them.  But for a quickie 12-day production that has rarely screened since its release (Hill rescued the only surviving print just days before it was to be destroyed), The Swinging Cheerleaders could school a whole lot of filmmakers in how to have your cake and eat it too.

The brand-new 2K transfer from Arrow Video (a blu-ray and standard DVD is included) looks very nice once you get past the optical and stock footage heavy opening credits.  Extras include a new interview and archival interviews with Hill (who also contributes an audio commentary) along with a sit-down with cinematographer Alfred Taylor, TV spots and a 2012 Q & A at the New Beverly.",1467331200,6,3115,5.210420841683367
