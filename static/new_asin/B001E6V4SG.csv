Simple just enough biographical n historical  information, dialogue with just enough difficulty, and only 27 minutes, Happy it is a DVD as my VHS copy is gone. Too bad could not rewind n fast forward as easily when needed as the Vhs copy. The quality is extremely poor but so useful for a tight teaching schedule with Shakespeare, it is worth the money.",1463097600,,398,4.605633802816901
8297083,1,B001E6V4SG,"Absolutely absurd to charge $60 for a 27 minute DVD? That's an entire month worth of Satellite or Cable TV at that price. Or 10 movies at the theater. An entire season of any TV series DVD package is less than 2/3 this price. Even worse, there is no actor of any significant fame appearing on this 27 minute production.

I cannot perceive what manner of insanity selected the pricing for this product. They clearly had no qualifications for pricing this item. 27 minutes is scarcely worth $6 let alone $60. You can buy a 4 disc, 540 minute miniseries about Elizabeth for 2/3 less including known actors as well.

I want to make sure that anyone who buys this DVD is aware of the 27 minute length listed before they shell out this price.",1362700800,2,736,4.444444444444445
