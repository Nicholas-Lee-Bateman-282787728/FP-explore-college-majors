If you're still able to use VHS, this will be your fave ab workout too!! I miss you Joanie!",1453161600,,239,4.1063829787234045
8409332,5,B003YIONJY,Thank you,1408924800,,9,4.0
8409333,4,B003YIONJY,I LOVE the video - it was way too expensive!  And looks like it has been in a box in someone's garage for a while.,1402012800,,114,3.56
8409334,5,B003YIONJY,"I love this workout!!!

I have problems with my knees, back, ankles..
this is an easy workout - my hubby bought it for me when we had our first child almost 24 years ago!!!!  It is about to break!  So I needed a second one, just incase.

The first few days are the worst (if you don't workout your abs) but once you get past that soreness, it is AWESOME!!!",1396483200,,356,4.042857142857143
8409335,4,B003YIONJY,"This workout has worked for me for many years.  It's short (about 15 minutes total), it's tough, and once or even twice a day can help.",1389052800,,135,4.1923076923076925
8409336,5,B003YIONJY,"Joanie Greggains was my favorite morning workout guide in the '90s. She has a likeable manor and delightful sense of humor, which after watching this video for 100+ times, still comes across nicely.
This workout is sort of difficult when I fall out of shape, and gets progressively easier each time I consistently perform it. I pause the tape, give myself a brief rest and rejoin. When done consistently my abs tighten, which really helps my back, because ""the back and abdominals are best friends.""",1385856000,,499,4.882352941176471
