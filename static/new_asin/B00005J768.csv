7938559,5,B00005J768,"I JUST RECENTLY SAW AMERICAN TRAGEDY ON TAPE AND I CANT WAIT TO GET THIS MOVIE ON DVD AS PART OF MY COLLECTION...MY REVIEW ON IT IS THAT THE FILM IS A CLASSIC COURT ROOM DRAMA.  I HAVE TO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE REVIEWERS THAT IT DOESNT PAINT A LIKABLE PICTURE OF THE CAST OF CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY THE LAYWERS AND OJ. FOR THE LAWYERS ITS SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE MORE INTO THEMSELVES THEN INTO THE CASE SOME OF THE LAWYERS LIKE SHARPIRO WHO FELT THAT IT WAS HIS CASE AND THAT HE CAN WAIT IT, JOHNNY OBSESSION WITH RACE WAS A CONFLICT WITH THE LAWYERS, BAILEY WHO WAS TRYING TO GET HIS CAREER BACK ON TRACK BUT NOT AS SMART AS HE WANTED TO BE AND BARRY SCHECK WHO HAD DOUBTS ABOUT THIS CASE DIDNT GET ALONG WITH M.CLARK.
  I LOVE HOW THIS MOVIE SHOW ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS TO GET OJ FREE. LIKE OJ WANTING TO TESTIFY ON HIS OWN BEHALF ,BUT WOULD MAKE A HORRIBLE WITNESS, THE EVIDENCES THAT OJ CANT EXPLAINS AND GIVES ANSWERS LIKE I CANT EXPLAIN THESE THINGS BUT I DIDNT DO IT, OJ ATTITUDE BEING UNGREATFUL AND THINKS HE IS AN ATTORNEY, THE FIGHTS WITHIN THE DREAM TEAM, THE PROBLEM WITHIN THE JURY WHERE THEY STARTED TO HATE ONE ANOTHER AND THE MEDIA PERCEPTION OF THE CASE WAS A PROBLEM TOO---I LOVE HOW THE MOVIE SHOW HOW THE MEDIA WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS CASE AS WELL AS THEY ASKED THE PUBLIC THEIR FEELINGS ON IT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT COURT TV WAS SO OBSESSED WITH THIS CASE BECAUSE AFTER ALL COURT TV WAS BORN DURING THE TRIAL. THEY DID COVERAGE TO COVERAGE ON THE OJ TRIAL AND PEOPLE WATCHED. SO ITS VERY INTERESTING HOW THE MOVIE SHOW THE MEDIA.
  FOR MY POINT OF VIEW...I DONT THINK OJ DID IT BECAUSE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS....IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY WITNESSES, NO MURDER WEAPON OR A CONFESSION AND ALL YOU HAVE IS CIRCUMSTANCE THEN U DONT REALLY HAVE A CASE NOW ALL OF U ARE GOING TO SAY OJ BLOOD WAS THERE BUT IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE U WILL SEE THAT HIS REFERENCE BLOOD WAS MISSING CREATING A CONSPIRACY TO FRAME OJ BECAUSE HE WAS DATING WHITE WOMEN. SO THAT IS MY POINT OF VIEW ON IT BECAUSE ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION WHY DID MARK.F TAKE THE 5TH WHEN ASK DID HE PLANT THE GLOVE. MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS CASE I MEAN JOHNNY DID A BRILLIANT JOB GETTING HIS CLIENT OFF TOO BAD HE DIED. I KNOW THE HATERS OF OJ ARE GLAD HE'S DEAD BUT JOHNNY WAS A BRILLIANT MAN, I JUST HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL FOCUS ON THE EVIDENCES AND NOT ON PREJUDICE OR BIASES.
  OVERALL ITS A GREAT MOVIE WITH GREAT PERFORMANCES BY THE CAST ITS A WONDERFUL DRAMA THAT HAS SOME VERY FUNNY MOMENTS AND IT HAS SOME TRAGIC MOMENTS AS WELL. KEEP AN OPEN MIND WHEN WATCHING THE FILM AND KNOW THAT THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF THE STORY .",1211328000,8,2647,4.138132295719845
