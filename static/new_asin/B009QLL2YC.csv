8543760,5,B009QLL2YC,"Natalie Wood (Natasha Gurdin) was an underrated actress who was beautiful, believable and funny,  These two comedies are well worth viewing. The scenes of a suicide attempt (head in an electric oven?) and Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda doing a romantic anniversary dance (The Twist?) are subtle and silly and very funny.  Look for more apt and timely comments o  pop culture, particularly if you're over 60.",1424131200,,406,5.029850746268656
