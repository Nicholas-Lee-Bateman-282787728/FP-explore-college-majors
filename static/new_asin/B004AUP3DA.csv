4311249,4,B004AUP3DA,"This epic of the English Civil War could have been one of the really great TV dramas if it had been at least two hours longer. Film is the art of elision, television much less so. Peter Flannery's previous saga was more than twice as long as this is and I would have hoped that for the DVD extra footage would be added, because there are indications that the narrative has been compressed more than is good for it.
Television in the past could always afford to dwell on dialogue scenes and explore the issues at length as film does not. This is neither one thing or the other, because it is a complex extended story like a TV adaptation of a 19thC classic novel yet the storyline is edited fast like a compressed film version. A great many things are happening very fast, in the public sphere and the private. But in biting off an awful lot of history it seems to be only barely doing justice to either the political issues or the personal stories of the characters. It's all very episodic, with short very strong filmic scenes such as the scenes of violence, spectacular historical crowd scenes, wide landscapes or a nude bathing scene, and a very impressively staged Battle of Edgehill left vividly in the mind, and in fact it is very strong visually in general.
Essentially, it has all the elliptical or porous density usually found in film adaptations where a lot happens against a complex background, AND MUCH NECESSARILY HAPPENS BETWEEN SCENES because of the pre-determined amount of narrative complication that has to be fitted in. A good example would be 'La Reine Margot' which was based on a novel by Dumas but here in fact the actual template appears to be 'War And Peace' the novel, with which there are many correspondences.
But with television we should not feel that so much has been left out to fit a limited time span especially when the story is an original one.
With the third episode it has become clear that this really is 'Our Friends In The North' (Flannery's previous epic masterpiece of television drama), transposed to the middle of the 17th century and that the Sexby character is the equivalent of Geordie, the Daniel Craig character in 'Our Friends'. Both are extremely tough and capable of controlled violence. Geordie was not in charge of his own destiny and was pushed around by the prevailing events but survived and prospered in the end. He was the representative of Everyman and he was thoroughly apolitical working class.
Sexby is also not in control but is a much more intelligent central character with some political consciousness from the start, and more wordlywise than Geordie who becomes more fully aware as the story proceeds. Geordie in 'Our Friends' at the 2/3 point is working as muscle for a Soho gangster, in the 70's during the glory days of police corruption and Soho porn. Sexby is working for Cromwell who is looking more and more like a gangster. Both become more and more sickened by what they are involved in and both are in love with a woman who is their salvation.
Sexby and Geordie, like Pierre in 'War And Peace' are man in search of meaning. In each cases the answer is a particular woman who enables them to find peace. Sexby returns from Cromwell's massacres in Ireland demoralized and half broken, and as disillusioned and despairing as Geordie who descends into alcoholism after he becomes sickened by his Soho period; or as Pierre returning from the Battle of Borodino disillusioned, like Sexby, with his former hero he now considers a dictator and attempts to assassinate, and failing to do so has to endure the retreat from Moscow.
In the end both characters reach a moral sticking point and act out of conviction.
In Flannery's epic the peasant wisdom and humanity of Tolstoy's Platon Karatayev has divided and multiplied into the tribal groupings of Diggers, Ranters and Levellers but collectively represented by the radical and uncompromising (historical) John Lilburne (he corresponds to the Christopher Eccleston character in 'Friends'). Against them are arranged the trimmers and the forces of property and the status quo led by the great political realist Cromwell. The cental theme of this drama I suppose is the way that revolutionary ideals are always taken over by ruthless authoritarians like Cromwell, Napoleon or Stalin.
ANGELICA FANSHAWE IS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER not to be confused with the woman of the same name who lived at the same time and wrote an autobiography which has nothing in common with this story.

In 'Our Friends In The North' the writer had more success in dealing with an equally large chunk of history perhaps because he could rely on our familiarity with the news stories of the recent past. But in dealing with the very complex political conflicts on the Parliamentary side and deciding to make Cromwell a major character he is taking on a much greater challenge, especially with so little screen time.
'Our Friends From The North' was one of the very finest works of Television literature ever seen so we owe to this writer the willingness to watch and think about this new project. At the very least we will learn a certain amount about the revolutionary politics of the Civil War. That means that we get to be reminded that Anarchism and Communism were really born here in the middle of the 17th Century, and didn't need Marx for anything that needed to be said before the introduction of modern banking and finance at the end of that century, and before the Industrial Revolution which grew out of them. (But Marx never did justice to finance capitalism anyway. He was too obsessed with the 'surplus value' created by labour to pay sufficient attention to the 'surplus value' created by money and credit.)",1353542400,3,5714,4.789260385005066
4311250,5,B004AUP3DA,"Being a great lover of the time period of King Charles and Oliver Cromwell; this captured the essence of the time and the people and politics involved.  The Cavalier's were portrayed just as I had imagined them from senior literature classes in high school; although it was a little more realistic concerning sexual conduct of those times; I am most happy to be living in the 21st century after viewing this epic.  The power of kings; the helplessness of the common man; the role of people on a mission to better society for all people.  In the end you get a real sense of how Oliver Cromwell began a mission to fix the power of kings; but, in the end was going about the same tactics as the man he had replaced as head of state.  I came away being grateful not to have been a woman of those times.",1346544000,25,798,4.3
4311251,4,B004AUP3DA,"First of all, let it be known that the blurb on the back of the DVD case is quite misleading in its attempts to market the product as more racy and spicy than it really is. The protagonist is described as a ""manipulative"" woman who ""exploits a country in crisis in a bid to better her own position"" and ""embraces her sexuality to the shock of her husband"". The tagline is ""in a country torn by war, she was the most dangerous weapon of all.""

From all this you might be mistaken into thinking that ""The Devil's Whore"" is a typical bodice-ripper / faux-historical melodrama, when it fact it is quite a tasteful period piece with a respectable, wholly sympathetic heroine who neither is nor does any of the things the blurb describes. Though there are a few instances in which historical license is taken, there is also a genuine sense of wanting to capture the key events of the English Civil War and integrate the fictional character of Angelica Fanshawe into the proceedings without compromising the authenticity of the piece.

Originally a four-part miniseries, which has here been spread across two discs without any noticeable breaks, ""The Devil's Whore"" alternates between two narratives: the life-story of Angelica Fanshawe (said to have been based on Anne Fanshawe, a memoirist who lived 1625 - 1680) and the English Civil War, following such recognizable figures as King Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, Thomas Rainsborough, John Lilburne and Edward Sexby. A good balance is maintained between the weighty historical events and Angelica's more glamorous tribulations, and she is incorporated successfully enough into the proceedings that you may find it easy to believe the film's (utterly false) claim that this is the ""true"" story of her life and times.

While still a child, Angelica Fanshawe's mother abandons her in order to become a nun in France, an occurrence that causes young Angelica to reject her faith and thus witness a vision of the devil that reoccurs throughout the series. On reaching womanhood, Angelica is happy enough to marry her childhood sweetheart (and cousin) Harry Fanshawe, but though he loves her dearly, he often feels emasculated by his spirited wife. It's her refusal to be subjugated that lands her husband in hot water with King Charles I, and soon Angelica finds herself negotiating a dangerous world on her own. She ends up rubbing shoulders with the likes of Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Rainsborough, unsure whether she's an ally or an enemy to them, as well as running from a past acquaintance with a vendetta against her. Her ultimate goal is to find a home and safety for herself, and despite the inclusion of no less than three love stories for her, each one has weight and poignancy, and provide Angelica with happiness and grief in equal measure.

Roughly spanning the years from 1638 to 1660 (to be more specific, the historical storyline begins with Charles' embarrassing attempt to arrest members of Parliament in 1642, complete with his famous ""it would seem my birds have flown"" comment and ends with Cromwell's death in 1658, though Angelica's story begins and ends slightly before and after these events) the miniseries takes us through the Civil War: the chaotic courtroom trials of ""freeborn"" John Lilburne, the battles between the Cavaliers and Roundheads, the tension between various sects of Catholics and Protestants, the execution of King Charles, and the power vacuum that follows.

It may help if you're familiar with the fundamentals of this time period, but even if you're not entirely sure what's going on, the film moves along briskly and entertainingly, making it easy to enjoy even if you can't follow every aspect. Though there are several deviations from historical record, there are also some nice little touches: the members of the crowd at the king's execution that dab their handkerchiefs in his blood, or the moles on Oliver Cromwell's face, or the presence of a small white poodle when Prince Rupert first appears.

There are some odd glitches: after introducing Prince Rupert, he disappears from the story entirely (perhaps his scenes were cut?) and Angelica's visions of the devil are never explained or elaborated upon, but as is to be expected, the visuals are stunning. Filmed in South Africa (which now bears more of a resemblance to 17th century England than the modern-day England countryside does), the vistas are huge in scope, creating a striking backdrop for elaborate costumes and sets.

The cast is top-notch. Andrea Riseborough (who at times bears an uncanny resemblance to Eva Green) is the high-light, simultaneously strong yet vulnerable, warm yet unattainable, and with an air of otherworldliness that makes it easy to see why she fascinates so many men. Despite the moniker ""devil's whore"" that is ascribed to her throughout the story, it is her name that reveals her true nature: more angel than devil, she carries the film with the help of a strong supporting cast.

Dominic West is a strikingly charismatic and dominating as Oliver Cromwell, walking the fine line between sincere idealism and self-justified tyranny, and Michael Fassbender (appearing before his big break in Hollywood) is Thomas Rainsborough, a tragic foil to Cromwell. Peter Capaldi is excellent as usual as King Charles, a gentle-yet-proud man who slowly crumbles over the course of his story-arc, and the likes of Tim McInnerny, Tom Goodman-Hill and Harry Lloyd (whose names may not be familiar, but who pop up everywhere in British television) play small but crucial parts. Also noteworthy is the fact that the wife of John Lilburne (as played by Maxine Peake) is given significant screen-time and development; a worthy addition considering that she was a fascinating figure in her own right, despite often being overshadowed by her famous husband.

Out of all the cast, the portrayal of Edward Sexby is probably most unlike his real-life counterpart (in appearance, personality and biography), but it's hard not to enjoy John Simm's embittered, war-scarred mercenary, a man who initially seems to enjoy bloodshed and who is unmoved by the ideals of those around him, only to gradually embrace a sense of personal conviction, driven almost entirely by his devotion to Angelica.

The American release of ""The Devil's Whore"" goes by the slightly-less provocative title of ""The Devil's Mistress"" (which makes little sense in context), but both the title and the blurb give the impression of a much darker and grimmer viewing experience than it really is. The sex scenes and gore is non-gratuitous, and though there are a couple of attempted rapes, both are thwarted at the last minute. It's impossible to gauge just how sensitive each individual viewer will be when dealing with this material, but don't be put off by the title. ""The Devil's Whore"" is a memorable and enjoyable period-drama, with an intriguing heroine and a story that manages to balance out Angelica's fictional tale with the historical events of the time.",1336003200,149,6990,5.059895833333333
4311252,4,B004AUP3DA,"I like this a lot but it really helps if you know something about the people and events of the English Civil War; sometimes called the English Revolution.  The quality of the DVD is marginal, to my eye there seemed to be some vertical distortion and, typical of English productions, the sound is weak.  At times, this is also too much of a ""chick-flick"" with the ""Devils Mistress"" flopping into bed with one handsome Roundhead, Ranter and Seeker after another.

Basically, the English Civil War was a three sided game between the King, Parliament and the people.  Dominic West is excellent as Cromwell, the only historic figure most Americans are likely to have heard of. ""Free-Born"" John Lilburne, Thomas Rainsborough (played by Michael Fassbender) and Edward Sexby are all here and their characters basically ring true.  But unless you are fairly well versed on the doings of the Levellers, the New Model Army, the Agitators and the Grandees, and unless you have some idea of the difference between a Puritan, a Presbyterian and an Anabaptist, the plot is hard to follow.  The lead character, ""The Devil's Mistress"" (Angelica Fanshawe played by Andrea Reisborough) is the only purely fictional character.

There are significant American connections here.  Thomas Rainsborough and his brother William were the brothers-in-law of John Winthrop, the Puritan Governor of Massachusetts, and both lived in Massachusetts from time to time.  Thomas is the hero of the story and had he not been assassinated either by the Royalists or by Cromwell, the circumstances will admit either possibility, the great ""what if"" of the time has Thomas Rainsborough wresting control of the New Model Army from Cromwell and, along with the Levellers, anticipating the American Revolution by 140 years and, based on "" An Agreement of the Free People of England"" (1649), establishing the first secular constitutional democratic republic in England in 1649, not in the US in 1789.

""An Agreement of the Free People"" had it all: Sovereignty of the people; universal sufferage; due process; and freedom of speech and religion and it really could have happened had not Thomas Rainsborough been assassinated.",1327017600,9,2180,5.15014164305949
4311253,5,B004AUP3DA,"When I watch movies such as this it makes me doubly sad to not be living in England, where period dramas show regularly on TV.

This story follows a fictional character called Angelica Fanshawe, but the other characters featured are based upon historical figues. Of course, as with many movies, there are liberties taken. But follow along with Wikipedia entries and you should be good to go. It's even better if you have a firm grasp of English history!

SYNOPSIS - WARNING: SPOILERS

Angelica is a well born girl who was taken in by Charles I and lives at court. Initially married to her cousin Harry, who was her father's heir, the two were best friends growing up but there immediate friction when Angelica shows herself to be an independent girl with a mind of her own. You both want to punch Harry and feel sorry for him, as he is heartbreaking naive and yet stubborn at the same time. [Spoiler] He meets his end rather unjustly, so you end up feeling like the poor chap got the shaft.

When we next see Angelica, she's starving in the streets. I can only assume that due to the circumstances of her husband's death, she was left with nothing to live on. A chance meeting with surly corn merchant leaves her no choice but to protect herself by murdering him. His friend, unfortunately, finds this out and makes it his life's mission to see Angelica hang. She spirits off into the countryside, eventually joining up with Edward Sexby, a soldier of fortune who has been in love with her since he first spotted her on her wedding day. His overt worship of her is so heartbreaking throughout the film; even though he's pretty ruthless, you cannot help but root for him, and gasp at his willingness to protect Angelica at all costs.

Set in the midst all of this is the English Civil War, a time of immense upheaval and rivaling political factions. You have the Royalists or Cavaliers who fight for the king and then you have the Roundheads who fight for so-called justice and political equality. Further into this faction, you have the Levelers, who believe that men should be equal. Of course Oliver Cromwell led the Roundheads and he is featured prominently in this film, fairly accurately actually (at least from what I know). There is also John Rainsborough, another colonel in the army who is staunch Leveler. He is great friends Cromwell as well as Freeborn John Lilburne, who was a popular pamphlet writer and public speaker during this time.

Now back to Angelica. She eventually returns to her family's estate, which was seized by the Roundhead Army. Through her connections with them (read: John Rainsborough) she is able to live in at Fanshawe Hall. [Spoiler] She and John fall for each other and are eventually married. He is soon called away to Penshurst Castle where he is murdered. Later in the film, Cromwell was accused of sanctioning his murder (since he was very popular with the masses), which may or may not have been true. Angelica is soon arrested by the crazy friend and thrown into prison. She sentenced to hang, but Sexby masquerades as the hangman and saves her at the last moment. She claims that she wants to take up with the ""diggers"" at Fanshawe Hall. I'm really not sure who they were; they were akin to gypsies from what I could tell. [Spoiler] Sexby reminds her that they won't take her in unless she is married and he offers to do that for her. So they get married, and Sexby ships off to Ireland for some time.

Angelica goes back to Fanshawe and falls in with the diggers. During her stay, she discovers that the crazy friend has been granted ownership of her property. Not cool. She also falls in with a young man named Christian who mysteriously knows her real identity and eventually claims to be in love with her. They are both turned out of the group after a while, and they go to London. They apparently fall in with the ""Ranters"" a group of licentious radicals who decide to celebrate the impending return of Christ by sleeping around and drinking with each other. Good times.

When Sexby returns from Ireland, he confronts Angelica, fearful that she has been sleeping around since she has been keeping bad company. Of course his jealousy rules him as he is still very in love with her. She says some seriously mean things and you geneally want to slap her upside the head for being so blind and selfish. [Spoiler] We soon learn that Christian was hired by the crazy friend to trap Angelica into sleeping with him since adultery is now a crime. Of course Sexby learns of this plot and steps in just in time. Afterwards, she finally gets it and decides that she may love him after all. Meanwhile Sexby has been the man-for-hire for Cromwell, but he is growing increasingly dissatisfied with Cromwell's tyrannical policies. When he refuses to spy for Cromwell, he is thrown out of the country. He believes that Cromwell ordered Rainsborough's death and he is determined to avenge him for Angelica's sake.

He returns to England eventually and he and Angelica FINALLY consummate their marriage, which makes you want to shout because he SO deserves to get some. Of course, their happiness is shortlived as he is determined to assasinate Cromwell. I won't tell you the end--it's rather bittersweet.

All in all, the plots were well developed and the acting was quite good. Michael Fassbender makes an appearance as Rainsborough, so this was definitely before he became better known in the States. Anyhoo, this is definitely worth a watch. I'll buying my own copy posthaste!",1324425600,49,5513,4.691830403309203

4311284,4,B004AUP3DA,"AN IMPORTANT PERIOD OF ENGLISH CIVIL WAR THAT WILL HELP FORM MODERN DEMOCRACY

COMPARISON OF U.K. AND EDITED U.S. VERSION INCLUDED BELOW (this version is the U.S. edited release)

This historical drama-fiction (originally called The Devil's Whore in the U.K.) is not the salacious production it has often been ascribed.  It is a fictional story set in a very important historical period that will affect modern democracy in both England and the United States.  This story is told through a mixture of real and fictional characters and several of those real characters have their relationships changed.  The secondary title of this movie is actually ""A true account of the life and times of Angelica Fanshawe"".  However, that is stated within the fictional world of this character and is not a literal assertion(see historical notes below for more).  Though it is not perfect history, I did appreciate the historical aspects and excellent performances.  This show does act as a conduit directing viewers toward further research of a very important period.  There is an excellent sequel to this show called New Worlds with Jamie Dornan.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  The story opens with the wedding of beautiful Angelica Fanshawe (Andrea Riseborough) to her cousin Harry Fanshawe.  As Angelica states ""he inherited the house and she already had the name"" so this is not just a marriage of political convenience.  It is a love match.  The story quickly backtracks to Angelica and Harry as children since they are life long friends.  We see through a series of events that Angelica's Catholic mother departs for France to become a nun, leaving the fatherless Angelica alone.  Little Angelica curses God and see's a hallucination or vision of the devil in a tree.  The viewer understands later that she told this story to others when she was just a child and it will contribute to why she is later called ""The Devil's Whore"".  Back to her new marriage.  She has served as a lady in waiting at the court of King Charles I (Peter Capaldi) and looks upon the Charles as her second father. Harry is also a favorite at court and is close friends with mischievous Prince Rupert.  Unfortunately, this love match of Harry and Angelica becomes complicated as Harry is not prepared for the naturally passionate but chaste Angelica.  Her soft sighs and passionate outburst in sex are misunderstood by the nave Harry who feels she should be completely silent during intimacy.  Harry remembers her childish tales of the devil and is even more suspicious.  Nevertheless, they are lifelong friends.  Soon clouds of civil war will hang over the entire country and test the survival of this couple.  One other important character introduced at the wedding is the real Edward Sexby who at this point is still a lowly soldier and mercenary.  He admires Angelica, but obviously cannot aspire to such a match.  He is assigned by Prince Rupert to serve as retainer to Harry Fanshawe and will follow Angelica in and out of the story as her protector.  Through Sexby and Elizabeth Lilburne, Angelica will come to meet Thomas Rainsborough (Michael Fassbender), John Lilburne, and Oliver Cromwell (Dominic West).  She is steadfastly supportive of Charles I, but inspired by the free ideals spread by the likes of Lilburne and his wife Elizabeth.  Ultimately the coming war will cloud many friendships and test many loyalties.  Angelica will be launched on a long journey of survival and redemption set against the depth of change in that era.  These are just the opening scenes and set up a much greater story.

OTHER THOUGHTS: The performances in this series really are outstanding and the scenery amazing.  The music is more modern sounding and actually cheapens the production a tiny bit, but doesn't ruin it by any means.  Excluding the weird visions of the devil (which did serve a purpose), this is actually a very serious production with excellent production values.  For Americans, the English Civil Wars are a very under explored topic in history, but are profound in their affect on our modern system of government.

HOW IS THE U.K. EDITION DIFFERENT FROM THE EDITED U.S. VERSION? The U.S. version called ""Devil's Mistress"" instead of the original U.K. ""Devil's Whore"".  It is approx. 24 minutes shorter than the U.K. edition.  I played both versions side by side to determine just how critical the cuts.  Mainly, there are a few scenes shortened, like where the Earl of Manchester commands Lilburne to bow.  There is a very brief conversation with the Earl and his commanders before he runs into Lilburne which is not included.  Small scenes like a meeting before a certain trial, or a part where a preacher is removed from the pulpit are cut entirely.  They add a little to the story, but are not critical and don't even damage the flow very much.  There is some editing of nudity and gore. It comes across as a bit token since there is still nudity and there is still bloodshed.  And of course there is the change of title to the less sensational ""Mistress"" instead of ""Whore"".  That does cause some continuity problems because in the show a character does call her ""The Devil's Whore"".  The nudity, as I said, is still there.  Instead of seeing a whole female torso, you may see the upper part of the breasts in one scene.  The cutaways are just much quicker so there is less nudity and for a shorter number of seconds.  The swim scene where Angelica walks out into the pond is cut short so her backside is never shown.  As I said, it's really not that sensational and if one is not concerned about the nudity in the shorter version, the longer version is unlikely to offend.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  ANGELICA FANSHAWE is not a real person, but it seems her name was borrowed from the very real Lady Ann Fanshawe who did marry a cousin named Richard.  That couple had 10 children and were royalists.  They did not have a life anything like depicted in this movie.  EDWARD SEXBY served in Cromwell's Roundhead Cavalry Regiment.  He worked his way from private to full Colonel through his various military service.  It is said he participated in the capture of Charles I at Holdenby House and also raised a foot regiment to serve Cromwell in Ireland.  However, he was ordered to Scotland prior to that campaign.  He had a fallout with Cromwell over the assumption of Lord Protector and did plan assassination attempts though his emissaries failed.  He died in the Tower of London in 1658 (not depicted in this movie).  THOMAS RAINSBOROUGH was the son of a Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy.  Thomas commanded vessels in the 1st Civil War, but eventually fought in the New Model Army.  Thomas was later killed by four royalists in a botched kidnapping attempt, though there were ultimately rumors tracing it back to parliament (and thus Cromwell).  JOHN LILBURNE agitated for individual rights and freedom during both the reign of Charles I and the interregnum of Cromwell.  He was incarcerated and tried many times.  One of his trials (depicted in this show) was even said to have inspired some aspects of our own 5th Amendment to the Constitution.  He was the author of The Agreement of the People and other works that may have contributed to aspects of our Constitution.  He was friends with Cromwell and fought distinguished battles. His campaign for individual rights ultimately put him in conflict with the Lord Protector.  His imprisonment in Mont Orgueil is depicted here, but his end is changed as the final transfer to The Tower is not shown.  PRINCE RUPERT OF THE RHINE (close friend of the fictional Harry in this program) was the nephew of Charles I and spent time at English Court, though he was the younger son of German prince Frederick V.  Though it was not depicted in this show, he became a preeminent Royalist General in the Civil Wars.  His sister was also the mother of King George I of Great Britain.",1430179200,7,8148,4.920087976539589

4311299,2,B004AUP3DA,"I cannot fathom why this received so many positive reviews.  I can only applaud the actors for giving their all in such a witless script.  The costumes, hair styling and makeup seemed authentic and the sets and buildings were also period pieces.  However, not only were the characters possessed of many startlingly modern ideas and the plot full of contrary to fact events, (for which one has developed a fairly high tolerance after years of historical movie watching) the story was distinguished by ludicrous and inscrutable developments, peculiar camerawork and continuity errors.

WARNING Spoilers ahead.
Why would a friend of Fanshawe, apparently Prince Rupert, appear, seemingly to witness the consummation of the heroines marriage, and exchange remarks with him on the edge of the nuptial bed?  Why would a couple in such circumstances proceed happily with their lovemaking?

What was the point of having an apparition of the Devil manifest itself to the heroine periodically throughout the movie?  It wasn't even a religious movie.  Speaking of religion, why don't the Roundheads who take over Fanshawe House smash up the Virgin Mary statue and idolatrous windows in the Papist chapel?

And where is any vestige of chaperonage for the heroine?  She dines alone with Cromwell.  She travels unescorted back and forth from her country estate to London.  She has sex with the Parliamentarian Thomas Rainsborough many times before their wedding.  She travels around with her Digger friend, and slow dances with him in a tavern before he slips her a mickey and prepares to assault her, witnessed by numerous Puritan looking gentlemen, before her faithful guardian rescues her in the nick of time, in what is thankfully the last of numerous mercifully aborted rape scenes.  She goes to live with the Diggers under the dubious protection of being a married lady with her husband off in Ireland and unable to lend more than his name for her security.

Why did her persecutor, the corn merchant, suddenly withdraw his testimony at her trial?  He gets a letter, some hair and a significant glance.  Were the audience members supposed to infer some machinations from this?  This alert viewer did not fathom the connection, and was admittedly unwilling to watch it all a second time.

I suppose that the main character, who goes from being a lady in the queens household, on speaking terms with the king, to being the mistress, and briefly wife, of a Leveller officer and then marries another New Model Army officer, and remains friends throughout the story with Freeborn John Lilburne, whose freedom she twice receives as a wedding boon, first from the king and then again from Cromwell, to become destitute, join the Diggers and finally end up a lady again at her own manor, incidentally previously confiscated from her upon her supposed execution for a crime not clearly named, which estate she somehow reclaims after the clandestine and cold blooded murder of a man, whose life she had previously spared, who has persecuted her for the murder of his friend, even though she should probably be not only disseizened but legally dead is supposed to be giving the viewer a tour of the events, players and ideals of the age.  But frankly, I think it came out about as convoluted as the sentence describing it.",1407283200,4,3302,4.990875912408759
4311300,4,B004AUP3DA,"The actress in this movie is amazingly talented. She outshines the men! Michael Fassbender does a fine job, as does the actor who plays the ever-evil and cruel, Oliver Cromwell. Quite a bit of battling and blood, but that's what they did then, so no surprises. I look forward to more movies starring this actress.",1403913600,6,313,4.709090909090909

4311303,3,B004AUP3DA,"This is a review for the American version, Devil's Mistress. I'm giving it three stars because while it is an excellent show, this version is heavily edited. It is twenty some minutes shorter than the UK version Devil's Whore, and the missing footage really makes it hard to understand what is going on with the plot.  If you can, get the UK version and watch it on your computer or a region free DVD player, it is much superior to this version.",1389484800,94,445,4.426829268292683

They felt it wasn't 'politically correct' to use the word 'Whore' in the title.  How puritanical and ironic!

4311305,4,B004AUP3DA,"An interesting mix of history and fiction and love story (although the word ""love"" may be stretching it a bit).  If you're interested in knowing more about the story -- look on IMDB or Wikipedia for the 2008 TV mini-series called ""The Devil's Whore"". (it was only released as ""The Devil's Mistress"" in North America)

The description is currently missing the actors names -- which is a shame because actors like Andrea Riseborough, John Simm, Peter Capaldi, Dominic West, Tom Goodman-Hill, and Michael Fassbender deserve to be mentioned.  Personally, I adore John Simm, so I loved that his character had plenty of screen time!",1386028800,,626,5.0
8420901,1,B004AUP3DA,"This is a terrific series -- if you watch the original British release
For some reason, the US edition here has been bowdlerized, shortened and if that's not annoying enough, it's also been renamed.

The series is called The Devil's Whore. Were there concerns the title would offend delicate American sensibilities? Cut me a break! The title follows the conventions of Jacobean and Restoration drama -- the era this thing is set. More specifically, it evokes John Ford's 1629 play 'Tis a Pity She's a Whore. (Say the word out loud. There, doesn't that feel better?)

The Devil's WHORE is composed of four 55-minute episodes for a total running time of 220 minutes, This version is 190 minutes.
That's a huge cut and it pretty much ruins the entire thing
There is very little fat in the drama as it was made. It's a tightly written economical script. The cuts are inexcusable",1527206400,3,874,4.743421052631579

THE COSTUMES, SETTING, ACTING, AND CREATIVE STORYLINE IN AN HISTORICAL DOCU-DRAMA IS QUITE BRILLIANT. During Oliver Cromwell's puritanical regicidal revolution 1645, the fictional aristocratic manor lady, Angelica Fanshawe follows her heart rather than political loyalty in the bloody conflict between royalists and Roundheads, and later among Crowell's triumphant, soon rivaling protestant followers. For love, she commits to several parties. After two civil wars, Charles l was executed, and Cromwell became Lord Protector 1653-1658, and served as the King of England without the title until1658 when he died of natural causes.",1526947200,,791,5.537190082644628
