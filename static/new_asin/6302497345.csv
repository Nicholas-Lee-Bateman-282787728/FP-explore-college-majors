7826685,3,6302497345,I was kinda expecting a little more than the average half hour episode. It was like just watching another show except it had a little Christmas in it. At least there are two shows instead of one. And i would have liked to have found it on DVD too. All in all it was just as entertaining as any of the other episodes.,1323734400,,316,4.031746031746032
7826686,5,6302497345,"This VHS video is my favorite over the Part II that is also sold via Amazon thru Sony Video!  I am suprised that Sony video has not combined both video's (4 episodes about Christmas!) onto one DVD?

But this is my favorite...Dick York, the original Darrin is my favorite Darrin Stevens actor...and he was also Agnes Moorhead's favorite too...since she tried to petition the studios to keep York on...but alas it failed!",1228953600,,419,4.805555555555555
7826687,5,6302497345,"The first episode is ""Humbug Not To Be Spoken Here"" Darrin and Larry are working on Mr. Mortimer's account on Christmas eve Samantha has to teach him the real meaning of Christmas.

The second episode is in black and white and from the first and second season. ""A Vision of Sugar Plums"" The Stevens take in a boy from the orphange for Christmas.

This is a wonderful video. Elizabeth Montgomery is a great actress.",1135123200,,414,4.581081081081081
