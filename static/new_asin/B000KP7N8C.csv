2696808,5,B000KP7N8C,My wife takes Yoga and the kids love trying the poses with Mommy.  I was wondering if there were any DVD's with direction for kids.  My daughters are 2 1/2 and 6 1/2.  This video is perfect for them.  They make us play it over and over while they exercise along with Leanne.  The music is great and the direction is perfect for kids in this age range.  What a great way to keep your kids interested in exercise without it seeming like exercise.  My daughters think it is just something fun to do.,1179273600,2,496,4.212765957446808
2696809,2,B000KP7N8C,"I was looking for a yoga video for my 9-year old daughter.  All the videos I found were for adults or younger children.  This video was reviewed by another buyer who said that her pre-teen enjoyed it as well.  Based on this review, I bought it.  My daughter doesn't use it because she feels silly exercising with children half her age.  The video is truly meant for a child.",1179014400,11,374,4.36231884057971
2696810,5,B000KP7N8C,"What this video lacks in budget it more than makes up for in technique and kid appeal.  My three year old asks to do yoga at least once every day (some days, two or even three times!).  We purchased this video one month ago and the children have not even mildly tired of it.  Moreover, Leanne Gotvald successfully grabs and maintains their attention for the entire length of the twenty-eight minute session.  I am more than pleased with the subtle reinforcement of the importance of fitness and strength building.

Leanne has a genuine understanding of children and what draws them, and their parents, in.  This program encourages the entire family to enjoy discovering the Child's Way.  Another bonus: this program teaches self-control and focusing skills!",1175385600,9,757,5.008
2696811,5,B000KP7N8C,"Our 3 yr. old and 6 yr. old really enjoy this DVD!  My husband and I join in with the kids.  We do the yoga all the way thru and then the kids want to do ""Hop Like A Frog"" again.  It's great we can go to the menu and pick their favorite ones!  The catchy music with the yoga moves makes it FUN for the whole family!",1170633600,6,315,3.588235294117647
2696812,5,B000KP7N8C,"I got this DVD about 2 weeks ago and love it!  I have three kids from age 2 to 10 and all three enjoy it. The music is fantastic and provides an opportunity for some physical activity in addition to the stretching/relaxing benefits of yoga.  The DVD has different options whether you want to watch from beginning to end, or a shorter version that is great for short attention spans.  I have already purchased another copy for a gift. I can't forget to mention that the instruction is fantastic.  There is obviously a lot of knowledge and experience by the instructor.

I recommend this for anyone who wants to get their kids more active or wants to exercise along with their kids.",1164672000,11,680,4.540983606557377
2696813,4,B000KP7N8C,"I liked this one and thought it was sweet and engaging, and most importantly not terribly annoying. My son is only 2 and so sits and watches most of it (we watch it in short spurts) but does do some of the moves and loves to watch the kids jumping. Simple and creative, low budget, nice video.",1362009600,,293,4.157894736842105
2696814,3,B000KP7N8C,"My 7yr old boy wasn't so captivated by this. He's very energetic, and I wanted him to take a time a day to relax after school. So far we've only used this once (in a week since we got it) and I think the way the video is done doesn't help kids concentrate on the postures. I think it would be better to model the correct position for more seconds than focusing on the kids each doing their own interpretation of what the adult is modelling. Nevertheless, I think the routine has a good length, as kids would get tired if it were longer, or might find it dissapointing if it were shorter. I also think the exercises aren't too hard to do, in general.",1356912000,,649,4.2
2696815,5,B000KP7N8C,"When the kids and I first watched this I was so disappointed, i thought that I had seriously thrown my money away.  But the kids LOVED, LOVED it.  We followed the video a few times and darn it if those silly songs don't make you smile. The yoga is fast paced and the songs are actually adorable.  I have to say the best part is that the kids love following the video.  I have a 4 and a 18 month old which is a lot to say since toddlers have very short attention spans. I highly recommend this video, just note you have to get past the cheesy recording.",1353801600,,552,4.036697247706422
2696816,5,B000KP7N8C,"My three-year-old loves this, and I enjoy it for her as well as with her. After renting it for a week, we bought it. I would recommend it to any parents of toddlers.",1329523200,,165,4.03030303030303
2696817,5,B000KP7N8C,"I was very pleased with this video.  We rented it and now I plan to buy it-- wish there was a discount to do this.  My youngest is 3.5 and she loves it-- we do it together and she follows all the moves with enthusiasm.  My older kids (6 and 9) really enjoy it, too, though I think partly this is because they are doing it to encourage the little one.  But my oldest has also done it on her own.  It is, as other reviewers have mentioned, a very simple, small-budget video, but the music is not annoying and the instructor is engaging.  The jumping portion gets out a lot of energy for days with bad weather when we can't get out.",1326672000,,629,4.073170731707317
2696818,3,B000KP7N8C,"The kids like it a lot. Its like a homemade DVD, cute and entertaining. My 2 and 5 yr. old really enjoy it. My 9 yr. old thinks it a bit silly....but will do it if everyone is doing it.
I am going to look for another one that I want to do with them. It all depends on what kind of parent you are. My mother in law would LOVE doing this with the kids, she is much more hands on than myself.
Its a fun DVD...good way to introduce yoga or add to your collection.
The music is pleasant with guitar and vocals. Not annoying.",1296518400,,519,3.8598130841121496
2696819,5,B000KP7N8C,"We got this for my son's fourth birthday.  He and his older brother can at least make a good approximation of all of the poses and have a fun time doing it.  At least one of them asks to do it daily.  Even their baby brother (15 months) seems interested.  I really like the background.  It looks like they are on a farm.  They are all in a big field, outside and it is very casual and relaxed.  The songs are upbeat without being annoying or over-loud and distracting.  The instructor makes it fun and I like the assortment of kids in the background, each interpreting the yoga moves their own way -- that shows that there are many ways to do the positions.",1267315200,,657,4.241935483870968
2696820,5,B000KP7N8C,I teach Kindergarten and use the Yoga video to help them relax after lunch.  It is fabulous and the kids LOVE it!!,1208822400,2,114,4.181818181818182
2696821,5,B000KP7N8C,"Our 2 year old daughter loves this video. She figured out how to do all of the poses without any instruction from us because the instructor is so clear and simple.  The setting is in a grassy park, and the home-spun music is so perfect and non-commercial.  Leanne has a life-loving glow about her that makes you smile.  It feels like how yoga should be.  Not in a fancy studio with music that fades in and out, but just simple.  The conversion of yoga poses to animal activities is wonderful.  Our 8 month old son loves LeAnne, and his face turns to joy when she introduces herself.",1199836800,2,582,4.392523364485982
2696822,3,B000KP7N8C,"The video is basically watching a yoga class for kids who are in a field of a park.  The teacher does talk directly to the camera, with some nice close-ups, but otherwise it often feels amateurish.  The music that they tout is just a woman singing with a guitar, and it's so soft that it's overpowered by the kids' giggles in the video.  And the music is not a motivating factor, instead it's more background noise.  Although I wasn't impressed with it, my son (who is 6) chooses it over ""Silly to Calm,"" which is what I like better (it's more professional, and the visuals and music are more dynamic).  But I think he likes this one because at one point they pretend to drive in a car, and he also likes the Dead Man's pose.  (My daughter, who is 4, seems to be able to stick more with ""Silly to Calm"")  Since I bought it for the kids, it's not a total failure, I just wished it was more pleasing to me!",1184198400,7,904,4.190751445086705
8158528,1,B000KP7N8C,"I rented this through Instant Video for my daughter. (She's 3) She has watched me do yoga, pilates, Ballet Beautiful, etc before and sometimes she likes to try it. She LOVES Ballet Beautiful. She saw me going through my Amazon Instant Video watch list through the Wii app and asked me what this video was for. I told her it was an exercise video for kids and she asked to try it. So I did the rental.

The video is very inexpensively produced, very low quality picture and sound. The lady sounds like she's yelling the whole time and the songs sound awful. My daughter doesn't like them. She also didn't want to do any of the moves. Normally she likes to attempt to do the poses and moves with me. She just didn't get into the video and prefers mine for adults.",1421539200,,761,4.321678321678322
8158529,5,B000KP7N8C,My 2 year old follows along with every bit of this and loves it.  She even sings the songs and does the moves on her own at the park.  Great intro to yoga for itty bitties.,1420761600,,172,3.75
8158530,5,B000KP7N8C,"My 5 and 2 year olds love a Child's Way to Yoga!  Easy and fun for all of the family to practice together, brings calm to an otherwise very busy household!",1414800000,,155,4.0
8158531,5,B000KP7N8C,I do this with my grandchildren and have shared it with parents. From age 2 on my grandson has often requested this DVD. The kids in the video are at all different levels and we have fun doing what we can. Leanne is a great teacher and we love the songs. I highly recommend this DVD. Easy to follow and adapt to different skill levels.,1392940800,,335,4.1692307692307695
8158532,1,B000KP7N8C,"This is more a chucky cheese type of kids show, than a yoga class. My daughter had zero interest, because much of it was just acting silly, and she actually does real yoga regularly. I appreciate what the teacher was going for (keeping the kid's interest, and making yoga poses imaginative), but the music was bad and the poses were too childish for my daughter, who is only 2, which says a lot.",1376265600,,395,4.424657534246576
8158533,5,B000KP7N8C,Just watched the video for the first time and my four year old brother loved it. We've tried a couple other children's yoga dvd's before and some can be very awkward but this one kept his attention because of the numerous songs. She does a example of a couple yoga moves in a child like scenario and then you act them out to a short song. We both really enjoyed it. Fun for the whole family.,1370304000,,391,4.157894736842105
8158534,1,B000KP7N8C,Super Cheasy and not at all appealing to my son... A kids yoga instructor cannot be fake; kids can tell when someone is inauthentic... The filming was very low budget too... I think I could have made a better video,1365638400,,214,4.375
8158535,5,B000KP7N8C,My daughter has been asking to do yoga a lot lately after working with me on one of my videos.  I was looking for something fun for her and me that showed some basic poses.  We tried it for the 1st time tonight and we all loved it.  It was fun and entertaining for her and quite the workout for me with all the hopping.  Great video for my 5 year old and me!,1363824000,,358,3.7972972972972974
8158536,5,B000KP7N8C,"My son loves it.  It gets him pumping, and jumping! I do it with him and we have fun together.",1363564800,,94,3.7
8158537,5,B000KP7N8C,"I would recommend this yoga video to anyone with young children. It is not as annoying or as bland as others I have found. Furthermore, if you do the exercises with your little one, you definitely get a work out. It is my favorite movie purchase of the year!",1362787200,,258,4.285714285714286
