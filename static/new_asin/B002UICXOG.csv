8478309,5,B002UICXOG,"This documentary is one that will touch your heart and soul. Was hesitant at first to watch, but like a good book you can't put down, this is one you can't leave the room till it's done. It truly showcases our veterans, heros and their families of their issues in what they go through after deployments from their accounts.  This awareness video is an excellent prevention and education tool. Highly recommend to watch",1311552000,2,418,4.726027397260274
8478310,5,B002UICXOG,"I bought this documentary after viewing on television.  I am a secretary at Jacksonville State University, Alabama, in a department of faculty who teach Counselor Education students.  I donated the DVD to the Counselor Education Library so that students could check it out to study PTSD.  I am also the mother of a U.S. soldier serving in Iraq.  DVD is very informative and I liked the fact that no media or politicians were interviewed....just the troops, families and counselors who treat them.  Excellent!",1305504000,3,508,5.072289156626506
8478311,5,B002UICXOG,"This is a very moving and informative tribute to the sacrifices that have been made by the men and women in our military, and by their families.  It provides very sensitive insight into the physical handicaps and emotional challenges a large number of our veterans face on return from war, and into the heartbreak and emotional challenges faced by their families.  This is very apolitical...its perspective is the men and women returning from war (and those who don't return) and their families.  The focus is very positive, inspirational, and informative.  A number of services are described which are available to veterans and their families.  I was really touched by the story of a wounded soldier who described how a chance encounter with a friendly dog at his bedside not long after his injury helped pull him out of his emotional isolation.  After his recovery he has devoted himself to training service dogs to help others like him.  Especially heartbreaking is a mother describing how she learned that her son had been horrifically wounded...but her words are juxtaposed with her son talking about how he has now risen above those injuries.  I find it just incredible that from the beginning of our country we have always had men and women like this who step forward and give so much for the rest of us.  How is that?",1259366400,3,1325,4.827433628318584
