8006001,3,B00013NDOG,"From 2003, perhaps Peach's lest-consistent era, and this is not a good selection from the library.

This is the period of time where everything that Peach produced was heavy on bells and whistles and unfortunately, often too light on substance. You can tell that a lot of time and effort was spent on multi-angle shooting, nothing more than a lark and in some cases downright annoying and ineffective. Which explains why nobody does multi-angle shooting anymore, Peach particularly.

The run time of the entire shebang is less than 50 minutes if you remove the bonus features. With those, just over an hour.

Covergirl Erica Jordan is fairly hot (sexy face--something that I wouldn't say about many women) but she has just two vignettes here so I don't know why anybody found her to be special enough to make the cover. She isn't the best-looking woman here (that would be Laurie Wallace, great butt). There are only about seven vignettes in total and none of them is worth talking about, partly because the women aren't that great--this was a terrible time in nude modeling when basically everybody had gross implants, including six of the seven featured on this release--and partly because nothing particularly exciting happens. No imagination in the way these were shot. Few good spread-leg shots.

The extras--mainly the brief behind-the-scenes feature--are a nice benefit and probably push this one from two stars to three. But overall, not a good way to spend your time.",1380585600,,1476,5.012244897959183
8006002,3,B00013NDOG,"If you've seen one of these Peach DVDs, you've seen them all. Hard to be too disappointed by watching sexy girls gyrate and strip naked, but this one left me wanting more.

The girls are sexy, particulary gorgeous, busty Angel (one of my favs) and always sexy Asian Teanna Kai. There's also a busty brunette in a swimming pool that will get you going. But ultimately, this one ends up being a little disappointing because there is not enough ""pink"". We get some, but not the long, lingering close-up and spreads you get in the better videos. Angel gets much sexier in her Hot Body International videos than here.

Did like the multi angle, as you are able to switch angles to see what you really want to see (and often focus in on the pink). Hey, for 5 bucks, its not a bad view and you'll probably get some ""fun"" out of it.",1169596800,,824,4.3441558441558445
8006003,3,B00013NDOG,"Thought I'd take a chance with this DVD, since the cover girl looked pretty hot.  After getting it, I saw that all the other girls had some nice outfits in the back cover pictures, too.

What do you know, but the videos actually have nearly all of them wearing different, more boring outfits.  Since the girls only strip, the outfits that they wear beforehand hold the most appeal to me.  (I guess years of Playboy have dulled me to the site of ""just"" a beautiful naked body.)  So, when the video doesn't match the outside pics, I'm extremely disappointed.

They do show some of the girls wearing those hot picture shoot outfits in the ~15 min ""Behind The Scenes"" extra.  But, it was not enough for me!

Why do video companies do this so often??  If the outfits are chosen for the cover because they're sexy, why not shoot the videos with them??

There are about 9 or so girls in 8 separate ~10 minute strip-tease videos (w/ the bonus ones).  They are all beautiful in different ways (ethnicity, hair color, body types), so if that's adequate for you, you may like this a bit more than I did.

I have to say that I did like the multiple-angle gimmick.  Music and video are very good quality. Although, the music can get distracting [and cheesy], so I sometimes lowered the volume.

Also, the cover girl does *not* speak German on film, nor does she have an accent!?  That was misleading, since it was part of the reason I bought it.

I bought this new from an Amazon seller, at about half of the above price.  If I paid top-dollar for it, I would have been extremely disappointed.",1105747200,11,1580,4.449477351916376
