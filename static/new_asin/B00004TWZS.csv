7923247,5,B00004TWZS,My daughter loves this video. She watched it all the time. This is a cute show that was on PBS about a girl and her dolly and their daily adventures.,1221955200,,149,4.0
7923248,4,B00004TWZS,I think people should buy it.  I like to do the clock stretch.  The most interesting part was when Loonette took the clock hands and pointed to which fruit Molly wants to eat.,1010188800,3,175,4.2727272727272725
7923249,5,B00004TWZS,"As the owner of many Comfy Couch videos, the whole series is great and my daughter has become addicted!! She loves ""Monnie"" and always does the clock stretch with Loonette.  Just beware, one video purchase will become many!!  I just wish it came on PBS in our area!",988329600,4,265,4.5
7923250,4,B00004TWZS,This is a good kids movie because it helps them see why it is good to take  naps and eat right. It also gives the parent some different ideas on  helping. The charcters on the film are clowns which kids really relate too.,969235200,,221,4.116279069767442
