8489728,3,B005ZIZRL4,I am 55 years old and found this DVD set too easy and the pace quite slow.  I think it is more suitable for people who are much older.  I will keep this for when I'm 70+.,1408060800,,170,3.5675675675675675
8489729,5,B005ZIZRL4,"I was torn whether to buy this product after I had already purchased some others.  It was, after all, what I desired: easy cardio, easy strengthening, easy stretching.  For the product, I give it a five star.  What I had not realized was that the three individual discs are also available in single boxes:  Easy Cardio Low-impact Aerobics; Fabulous Forever Easy Strength; and Fabulous Forever Easy Stretch.  Each of these singles are available for $20 each, totaling $60 for the set of three.  With the Trilogy set you will find the cost not much lower, at $50.  The Trilogy case provided I would give a two or three star, if that.  It is very poorly made, and the individual discs don't stay put, or ""latched"" in place.  I am 62 with some balance and coordination issues, so I've felt cautious about attempting the Easy Cardio.  I watched it through first and was delighted at how much fun she was having.  At first try I tried to follow just the foot work without the arms.  This next time I followed the arms, and legs when able, enjoying ever minute of it.  The best feature is how GOOD you will feel inside and outside afterwards.  The set is well worth having; but, if I known about the Singles I would have ordered them separately. The Single cases are well-made and hold the discs firmly.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy yourself!!",1377475200,3,1332,4.556962025316456
