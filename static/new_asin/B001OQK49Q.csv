8331179,1,B001OQK49Q,The DVD video quality is beyond horrendous.  I can't believe some of the other reviews raving about the beauty.  Looks like someone mounted a digital camera on top of their car and drove the route.  lots of vibration and digital artifacts present.,1362528000,,247,4.833333333333333
8331180,5,B001OQK49Q,"I have several Spinervals, some CTS's and Bike-O-Visions and this series is a fantastic addition to my indoor trainer-riding library. I also have Maui Rollers.  The music is decent enough that I don't use my MP3 instead.  You can choose from different coaches, or turn them off.  The scenery is wonderful; the ride from the cyclist's point of view much more realistic than some other videos; PLUS the bonus features at the end are great - yoga, or strength conditioning or pilates depending on the dvd.",1323302400,,502,4.813953488372093

8331182,5,B001OQK49Q,"I took this ride with the Italian coach today. We have a choice of several and I was glad to know that the Italian coach is not 'coaching' in Italian. He speaks English, with a fun accent. At times I had to think a minute to figure out whether he wanted us to stay in the saddle or stand.

It was an excellent ride. At one point he mentioned that we might just want to get a drink. If you do this one, take that recommendation seriously. A few minutes later he says, ""If you want a drink right now, we don't have time! You can have a drink when we get finished.""  :)

The scenery is beautiful as on all of the Global Ride cycling DVDs. I got a great workout.

I'm just a novice at cycling, but I can see how a 'real' cyclist could duplicate the conditions the coach is going through during the ride. He was working hard. That was obvious because we could hear him breathing hard. Then again, so was I, and I was working at a much less intense speed and resistance, but the ideal one for me today.

I love these rides and look forward every day to a different one.",1267920000,,1063,4.0669856459330145
8331183,4,B001OQK49Q,"I really like this video since it's quite a diversion from your everyday indoor bike ride. My only complaint is the narrator breathing heavily into the microphone. I think they could have done something about that. So, I listen with just the music on and find it to be quite enjoyable. The island is beautiful and you actually feel like you're there. It's a nice escape.",1267315200,,370,4.621212121212121
8331184,3,B001OQK49Q,DVD arrived quickly and the scenery is pretty.  Sound is horrible and instructions did not fit the terrain.,1266969600,,107,4.944444444444445
8331185,5,B001OQK49Q,"Training DVDs have been around for quite a while and for the most part they have consisted of video of people indoors on trainers, sweating and straining as a cool and relaxed coach in a polo shirt urges them on.  But most of us we can see sweating and straining cyclists simply by putting up a mirror: the only thing more boring than your own Tour de Basement is watching someone else's.  So the idea to show scenery has now blossomed and an impressive range of videos has appeared in the last year that promise to make those training hours fly by as you sweat and strain in an exotic location.

Global Ride, the New Kid on the Training DVD Block, began as a spinning, pilates and yoga club in Pennsylvania. There was a realization that cyclists used to the road found indoor workouts barely tolerable, while many in the spinning community had no interest in going outside and facing the perils of traffic. The goal of bringing these two groups together has resulted in a series of DVDs that attempt to link interesting scenery and music with appropriate modern coaching and additional off-bike workouts. How successful is this?

The first series of DVDs covers rides in Hawaii and the one that I received, ""StrenDurance,"" is a compilation of three segments, featuring a long climb up Tantalus on Oahu, followed by a flattish stretch of coastal ride on Maui and ending with a series of charming rollers, also on Maui. The series begins with a segment of still images as you do your warm-up prior to the actual training. My first impression was that this was a bit long but I quickly realized that a) it allowed me to set my own warm-up rhythm and b) as I spun in my unfinished basement with the temperature at -29C outside I found that I was mesmerized by photos of lush, green Hawaii and actually looking forward to the rest of the DVD!

The Tantalus component, in which you are accompanying another cyclist, is a steady but not too steep climb that takes you above the city of Honolulu up the extinct cinder cone of this now-deceased volcano. Honolulu is actually built on the ashes of Tantalus. You continue up the steady climb, with occasional views of Diamond Head, until you approach the summit at 634 m (2014 feet) ASL. Coupled with the previous warm-up, this is a good start to the program.

The next section, which is coastal highway from Laihana, is actually not quite as interesting as not only is it flat but to your left is heavy traffic and on the right the sea so there is not a great deal to look at. But at least it feels warm (apparently the word ""Laihana"" is the Hawaiian phrase meaning ""merciless sun!"") and the segment allows you to do some steady state/tempo riding. There are a few rollers at the end as you approach the next segment.

This last segment, Maui Cliff Climbs, is simply fantastic. For those of us who believe that the only point to riding a bicycle is climbing, this is nothing less than paradise. You ride a whole series of hard hills, with amazingly varied scenery, along a beautifully-maintained asphalt road that is completely devoid of any other traffic. When this segment came to the end, I went straight back to the beginning of the chapter and rode it all over again. And yet again. One of my only complaints about this DVD is that at around 50 minutes for the cycling section it is short for those of us who have 90 to 120 minute workouts scheduled. Some of the other DVDs I have are of a similar length. On the other hand, you can just use the remote to extend things.

But, as they used to say on those frentic TV ads, Wait! There's more! One of the very cool features of this DVD is that you can ride while listening to a coach-and not one coach, but you have a selection of three! You can choose Sally Edwards (representing the USA), Massimiliano Zambiasi (Italy) and Nicci Heath (Australia). These are all experienced coaches and on the voice tracks they are breathing pretty heavily so it is like they are suffering there with you. So on each ride you can pick which coach you want for that day. A nice feature.

And after the cycling segment there is a cooldown one where you can look at upcoming DVDs from Global Production (ah-Italia!) and this segment is then followed by something unique for a scenery DVD-you have to get off the bike and do a 30 minute strength training program with lightweight dumbells. This is led by a distressingly fit-looking coach who takes you through a rather challenging circuit. I think the addition of a cross-training segment is an excellent idea.

The music chosen for most of this DVD is by Andy Hunter, a British DJ, and is in the techno/trance mode, and is well-suited to the rhythms of the ride. It is commercial music and reflects well on the professionalism of the Global Ride producers. The other thing I was impressed by was that the screen is not cluttered up with many distractions, allowing you to enjoy the scenery as you pedal. And the pace of camera work is not far off of a racing bike's speed. Well, perhaps faster than me...

As you can tell, I enjoyed the DVD very much. I think it is has terrific scenery, good music and excellent special features. I have already ordered the other two DVDs in the Hawaii series, which are extended versions of the coastal ride and more on Maui. After watching ""StrenDurance"" I am all set to pack my bags and ride those Maui cliff climbs, which is probably as good a recommendation as one can give!

The company promoted its product by taking it around to spinning studios and doing product demos. I have suggested that my local fitness club get the DVDs since our spinning room has black walls and nothing to look at. At least nobody is making me work out for four hours there...",1233705600,9,5722,4.52321083172147
8331186,5,B001OQK49Q,"This is definitely the ""boss battle"" of the Global Ride Hawaii Series DVDs.  It's an awesome workout which definitely lives up to its name, requiring massive amounts of both strength and endurance to get through.  The choices in the coaching tracks are excellent as they include Sally Edwards and Matty Reed, the music is pretty decent, and it even has a bonus strength training session at the end.  The strength training isn't super hard, but if you do it right after your ride, it is just what you need.  Overall a really solid product - best of its kind out there.",1231804800,5,567,4.584158415841584
