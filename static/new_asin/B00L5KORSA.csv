6470702,5,B00L5KORSA,"Finally get to own one of the best shows from my childhood!  Its over 10 years later and I still love watching the show!  The video and sound quality is good.  For anyone looking to remember their childhood, or wanting to introduce their kids to a new group of student athletes, make sure and pick up your copy of each season of Rocket Power!

Now I'm just waiting for them to release the complete third season!",1410134400,2,411,4.368421052631579

6470707,5,B00L5KORSA,"I loved Rocket Power as a kid and still love it to this day! I can not completely describe how thrilled and excited I was to find these on amazon! Since it is made on demand, it has a very simple menu. I don't even care about the menu. It allows me to pick and choose my episodes. The only problem with this is that the intro is super loud and then the rest of the episode is rather quiet. It doesn't even bother me enough to take away a star. This is the best thing to happen in my adult life and I can't wait to share this.",1456790400,2,525,3.8256880733944953

8663866,5,B00L5KORSA,"The 4th and last season of Rocket Power is not only the shortest one of all (as CatDog had only 8 shows in its own 4th and last season), and I don't mean about Sam's stature (alias Sammy, alias Squid), via this set's front cover and menu pictures, but it's almost entirely made up of specials and TV movies, including the half-hour Christmas episode (which is the only show in all 4 of these season sets to NOT have a modern Nick jingle to start it off)! In this season, we finally learn what became of Otto and Reggie's mom, and ""Raymundo"" discovered a worthy new wifey (pronounced ""wife-fee"") to be their new stepmom; don't worry, she was great buddies with the late Danielle ""Danny"" Rocket and she's Tito's older cousin! As short as this season is, there's still a lot of fun to be had with it, including Twister's survival skills from a seemingly ""dorky""-but-all-too-real TV show based on the Legal Eagle segments of Fat Albert, or Fat Albert in general. And believe me, they truly did help get Team Rocket out of real, extreme danger in the Grand Canyon! This is a 2-disc DVD-R set containing the last 11 shows, including the TV movies taking up 2 or 3 shows apiece; that's why it's at a lower price than the first 3 season sets! Conclude your collection of Rocket Power season sets with the 4th and final season today! ""Suh-weet!""",1459987200,5,1336,4.524793388429752
