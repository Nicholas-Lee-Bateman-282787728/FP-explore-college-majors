2812520,5,B000P6R9IK,I bought this for my daughter as she was getting excited about the new Underdog movie about to be released. I thought it would be good to see how she would react to the old Underdog cartoons. She loved it! I also enjoy watching the old Underdog episodes.,1191456000,,254,4.3125
2812521,5,B000P6R9IK,I still enjoy cartoons as an adult and being able to see the cartoons I grew up with is great. My children also enjoy watching it over and over again. My children can't wait for me to purchase the next volume.,1191196800,,209,4.121951219512195
2812522,5,B000P6R9IK,"I have all 3 dvds when they came out. I loved the DVD set. The format was cool. You can watch just Underdog or watch the 2 parter with everthing in between. Lots of times I didn't care what was in betweeen the episodes. I just wanted Underdog! I did like extra storyboard on DVD 3 ""The Nug of Nog"". It was cute. I buy the dvd's for Underdog nothing else.",1187654400,,354,4.0
2812523,5,B000P6R9IK,"While I do share the frustration of you purists out there --- it would be ideal to have these classics uncut and complete --- I'm giving this DVD (and the others in the series) 5 stars.  Even with any cuts that may have been made, this DVD set still retains the charm and humor of my childhood hero.  I cant seem to find Underdog on any of the cartoon networks, merchandise & collectables are sadly too limited, and it's scary to think that the only exposure to Underdog for today's youngsters is the hella-lame Disney live-action movie.  I'd much rather settle for a few trims here & there with this DVD set than accept a pale imitation being the only canine crusader out there saving the world.",1186185600,,696,4.464566929133858
2812524,5,B000P6R9IK,"I never bought the first sets of Underdog DVDs which appeared a few years back.  Not sure why, but I suppose I wanted to buy a whole set and save a few bucks.  Well, I finally did.  I bought a set of the new DVDs from (another brick & morter store) for 20 bucks for 3 DVDs.

Now, not seeing the previous DVDs I am not sure how they compare.  I do know that I read a few reviews which kept me from buying the first set from here.  Statements that they cut things short or sped things up made me think it wasn't worth buying.  Well, Classic Media must read these reviews.  They restored the episodes to cliffhanger episodes with the cartoons like go go gophers and tennessee tuxedo, klondike kat, tooter turtle and more with their title screen and tunes seemingly intact.  OK, maybe a few seconds of the actual theme songs were cut.  Sure, it would be nice to have them complete, but when going from cliffhanger to tennessee tuxedo, I didn't really miss it.  Besides, they do have a DVD set of Tennessee Tuxedo for those of us who want the theme song before each episode.

The transfers look great!  The sound is awesome and the stories are as charming and silly as ever.  How they ever got away with a magical pill that enhances strength and makes it possible to hit more home runs than Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron I'll never know.  OK, maybe not home runs.  But he does get his strength from ""artifical means"" and not one kid ever thought it was cheating.  Then again, Underdog never went up against Superman, Captain Marvel or even Mighty Mouse to prove who was stronger.

Truly, outside of a few purists who just have to have everything exactly the way they want it, and I am not blaming them for wanting it that way, most anyone will enjoy this set from quality and quantity stand points.

Final word on purists...
I am a purist for most things, but there are some things I will take whatever I can get.  This is one of those items.  Like Ultraman and Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes, I am happy to have the chance to watch things I enjoyed as a child and see it through those childlike eyes again.  So if it's missing a few things, I'll forgive as long as the transfers are clean and the episodes of the main feature are complete which these are, I won't complain.

This set is a nice set for kids of all ages.  It's also fun to hear some of the voices from other cartoons and animated classic such as, the Christmas animations Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman, in another format.  Keep a kean ear open as you will place a few voices from other TV shows, cartoon and classics.

Happy watching!",1185753600,,2606,4.3436853002070395
2812525,5,B000P6R9IK,"No need to fear! Underdog is here! Everyone's favorite caped canine superhero has once again flown into view . . . and the welcome mat (and doggie treats) is out. The three volume collection includes favorite episodes from the animated TV series . . . all together now (in your best Wally Cox voice):  Not bird, not plane, not even frog, it's just little old me, Underdog! And the timing couldn't be better: The DVD releases come on the paws of the big screen version starring the vocal talents of Jason Lee and Jim Belushi. Each volume includes six complete, digitally re-mastered episodes from the classic small-screen series. Mix this with shorts starring Hunter, Go Go Gophers, Klondike Kat, Tennessee Tuxedo, King and Odie, Tootie Turtle and Commander McBragg and you have one cool canine, even on the dog days of summer.",1185580800,,826,4.816901408450704
2812526,3,B000P6R9IK,"I was pretty excited to rush out and buy these DVDs at last, but mostly I was excited to finally see Tooter the Turtle once again. I was excited that is until I got them home and started viewing them, I was really disapointed when it came to the Tooter segment that it just starts....no intro, oh well i could live with this....then came the ending, oh! my most favorite part was coming up... you know the part where tooter cries for Mr Wizard to bring him back home, anticipation....Tooter spins in the vortex...then Mr Wizard says ""Drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome; time for zis one to come home""....oh boy!! here it comes!!!......then nothing. It ends right there, abruptly. My favorite part where Mr Wizard scolds Tooter and tells him ""Always Always I tell you Tooter, Be just vhat you is, not vhat you is not. Folks vhat do zis are ze happiest lot."" is gone. I really hate to split hairs but it makes this grown up kid feel cheated . Sigh. Huh? What? The rest of the Dvd you ask? eh, its ok i guess......(shuffles feet, while looking down at the ground)",1185494400,16,1058,4.487046632124352
2812527,3,B000P6R9IK,"Just like the Space Ghost set I bought last week, these ""episodes"" are cut. They'veleft out most of the bridging material between the segments (such as the theme songs that used to play before the extra cartoons like Go-Go Gophers would start). This along with some time compression (Underdog sounds like Sweet Polly since his voice is sped up so fast!) on some segments and editing of other segments reduces the shows to around 19 minutes! What's the deal folks? I love this stuff, but can't any company find or create the complete episodes for any cartoon series??? Heck, I'd take the horrible 16-mm syndicated prints that used to show when I was a kid if I could get all of the material!",1185408000,4,690,4.617886178861789
2812528,4,B000P6R9IK,"I have mixed feelings about these new Underdog DVDs (this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Underdog-Collection-Volume-1/dp/B000P6R9IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Underdog-Collection-Volume-3/dp/B000P6R9IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 3</a>). On one hand, I think the cartoons here are great for kids. Originally airing on 1960s television, the Underdog serials have just enough sarcasm (""Look! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a frog!) to engage even the most jaded child, and the show's additional cartoons include not just Tennessee Tuxedo, but the great Tooter Turtle and World of Commander McBragg. (Others include the King and Odie, Klondike Kat, Go Go Gophers and The Hunter.)

That said, whoever put together this set apparently has no appreciation for its contents. The shows on this disk are edited! Not for anything racy or racist (this was '60s television, after all) but just because someone is apparently too greedy, or too lazy, to deliver what they promise. Despite the fact that these were 30-minute television shows, on this disk each Underdog show -- which has two 'dog episodes and two additional cartoons -- runs only 19 minutes.

Worse, the cuts are done with the subtlety of a meat clever. For example, in the Tooter Turtle shorts, after Mr. Wizard says ""Drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome, time for this one to come home""... the cartoon ends! As another reviewer points out, that's NOT the end!

As for the Underdog stories on this particular ""Volume 2"" DVD, when Riff-Raff plans to steal the gold out of Fort Knox in 1964's ""The Great Gold Robbery,"" he also captures Sweet Polly Purebred. Underdog and Polly battle vicious rats when they get shrunk by bad guy Simon Bar Sinister in 1964's ""The Big Shrink."" Finally, when aliens invade Earth and turn everyone into their slaves in the 1966 serial ""The Marbleheads,"" Shoeshine Boy eventually finds a way to turn himself into Underdog and save the day.

I gave this set four stars because of my fondness for Underdog, Tooter and Commander McBragg. But if you buy it, be prepared to be at least a little frustrated.",1185321600,17,2322,5.741279069767442

2812544,4,B000P6R9IK,"This is another great collection in the Underdog series.  It has the added bonus of sing-along lyrics for two versions of the themes. It also has so-called promotional spots, like the one that introduces us to Shoe-Shine Boy. When I watched this way back when, these spots were always in the show, so I don't think of them as bonus.

The only big disappointment, which is the case with all the series, is that the extended credits are nowhere to be seen.  There was the whole paint roller thing, going down as new credits were laid out, and much more music, some of which appears as background music in episodes.

Please release more volumes of this, and give us those credits!",1308268800,,677,4.570247933884297
