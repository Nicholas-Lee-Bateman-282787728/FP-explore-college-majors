8746934,5,B01AB4Y762,"Beautiful production and very accurate I thought. Begins with David capturing the capital city, so he is at one of the high points of his career. Then flashes back to Saul being anointed king by Mr. Spock. But King Saul soon falls to the power of power, his son Jonathon is at his side. David slays Goliath and is admired, King Saul is soon jealous and wants the young upstart dead, despite David's faithfulness. Jonathon supports him.

War violence and David becomes King. Then he oogles a neighbor lady and when she gets preggers he sends for her husband in an effort to cover their hook up. The husband declines the pleasure and his committed to being a faithful soldier which requires King David to return him to battle for sure death, then they can continue to carry on. Baby dies.

Years later he has a load of children from different women and one son wants some special times with his...HALF SISTER, then FORCES HER! THEN NAME CALLS HER! His other brother has seen enough and soon the first brother sleeps with the fishes. Then THAT brother listens to foolish advice and decides He will rule, running David out of town. He is eventually chased down and hacked out of a tree.

An engaging story and heartbreaking. Very WELL DONE I thought.",1510272000,,1246,4.603603603603603

8746941,1,B01AB4Y762,"Buyer beware. Do not purchase this version published by the SHOUT Factory. It has scenes missing. And while the SHOUT Factory website shows this versions time as 173 minutes, the Amazon product page shows 190 minutes. The movie you will get will only have 173 minutes.

190 minutes is the time of the actual, uncut, movie.

One of the scenes that is cut from the SHOUT Factory version is the scene where Samuel anoints David. Here is a link to a YouTube video showing the missing scene. If the time stamp doesn't work, skip to 1:54.

I am very disappointed that this movie has been altered, and am equally disappointed that potential buyers were not made aware that this was an abridgement of the original. It's a shame, since this is one of the best Biblical movies ever produced.",1462838400,4,788,4.607142857142857
