8134972,3,B000GW8V6C,"Just as it was described... Pictures taken around LA to ok music.  It's worth the price,  but you could make it yourself but you'd have to put up with traffic going to every site and it would take a lot of time",1379376000,,210,3.9761904761904763
8134973,4,B000GW8V6C,"Looking at some of thes.e other reviews, I would say folks need to read the descriptions better before buying, when we plan for events we need content that sets a scene, this works great for LA vibe things. BUT IT IS NOT A TRAVEL GUIDE as much as you may want it to be one, if you want a travel guide watch Treasures Los Angeles beach Bike Path on Amazon VOD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Treasures-Ep1-The-Los-Angeles-Beach-Bike-Path/dp/B001707OOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Treasures - Ep1 The Los Angeles Beach Bike Path</a>",1254096000,,572,5.987804878048781
8134974,1,B000GW8V6C,"I was hoping for an introduction or a tour of LA, instead, everything on the DVD was pictures that doesn't move.  There were no explanation of what pictures you are looking at or any narrative of any kind.  All you have is this music, which I have never heard before.  I could have easily just downloaded those pictures from the computer, or get it from any magazine, and not pay $20 for it.  I would love to return it, but they made it really complicated.  I will have to pay re-packaging fee + shipping and some other used fee or something. Save your money, and buy something else.",1229040000,,583,4.361111111111111
8134975,1,B000GW8V6C,"I thought it was a documentary about LA that I could show friends that come and visit me. Instead, it's just music with (great) pics of the city...but that's it. I guess you can put it in if you have a party...for some ambience. But besides that, it's completely useless. At least for me...",1194134400,2,290,4.388888888888889
8134976,5,B000GW8V6C,"where does it say its a travellogue?  i bought this DVD knowing it was a background visual, which i use for background displays at conferences.  i also saw it in a few LA based hotels and resturants.  good utility if used properly.",1163376000,2,231,4.4523809523809526

The beach life, the freeways, Catalina, downtown, Hollywood, I could go on... Well done to the makers of this. We use it when we have get togethers and let it play, people always ask about it, so I have started buying them as gifts for all my out of town guests, make them jealous of what they are missing. I recommend it!",1156896000,4,798,7.237113402061856
