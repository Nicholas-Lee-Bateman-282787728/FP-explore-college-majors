8722114,2,B010CVV0EG,"Found this film due to the earlier film Calvaire, which I love. But I couldn't make it through this one. The characters are just so screwed up and the plot so dark, it did not have any of the dark appeal and originality that Calvaire does. I admire this filmmaker's way of being brutally honest and unflinching, but I couldn't get into this. Maybe you will have a different experience.",1462492800,,385,4.514285714285714

8722116,4,B010CVV0EG,"It seems French cinema is more in touch with the roots of American crime and horror than the States are these days. The most ferocious American horror film of recent memory was the remake/update of ""The Evil Dead"" which benefits from a lack of routine horror humor. Like that film, ""Alleluia"" is a highly watchable downbeat feature from Fabrice Du Welz with just the right touch of black humor. Here Du Welz Teams again with the always excellent Laurent Lucas from the director's previous nightmare, ""Calvaire"". That film was a strange update on ""Deliverance"" that blended elements of American seventies grindhouse horror into the mix. While not completely successful, ""Calvaire"" is a favorite of mine and deserves to be seen if you've forgotten to add it to your disturbing films list. With ""Alleluia"" Du Welz has tackled another psychological horror mixed with true crime that may appeal to an even wider audience. Anyone familiar with the underground classic ""The Honeymoon Killers"" will see many similarities. Though we don't have an obese nurse (this time our female murderess appropriately works in a morgue) named Martha Beck we do have Laurent Lucas' gigolo who bears more than a faint similarity to Ray Fernandez via Tony Lo Bianco from HK with a foot fetish. Like the real Fernandez, Lucas' Michel suffered an injury to his head that was speculated as having a distinct effect on the real Fernandez' behavior. Such an injury was never mentioned in HK. For a fun night of twisted relationships run Leonard Kastle's ""The Honeymoon Killers"" back to back with this and compare. I have little doubt Du Welz was a fan of Kastle's unappreciated gem which has finally being regarded as a classic of true crime cinema. There have been at least two other films that tackled ""The Lonely Hearts Murders"" before and even though ""Alleluia"" uses the true story only as a framework it's the best I've seen since HK. It's also loaded with some eccentric character performances like HK. For another treat listen to Du Welz discuss his love of seventies horror in an interview included in the extras on ""Calvaire"". An in-joke or possible reference to ""Calvaire"" pops up in ""Alleluia"": Laurent Lucas' character in ""Calvaire"" was referred to as Gloria by his torturers and that's also the name of his significant other in ""Alleluia"". Du Welz, like Gaspar Noe, may be a director to keep your eyes on in the coming days.",1449014400,2,2407,4.901960784313726
8722117,5,B010CVV0EG,"A psychologically thrilling story with horrific elements that are truly horrific, all the more so because these elements illustrate the the inner-workings of the minds of and relationship between the lovers who carryout these horrors.  If you like horror films, see this, but know is far more than a horror film.  It is a love story, or many love stories, albeit extreme ones.  Yet, even if those violent, unexpected (totally) loves fall far outside the normal and expected. at the heart of this horror lies the innocent and persistent longing for nurture and care -- that sort of love -- that children seek if not expect from their protectors/parents/adults.  You will find no dulling back-story justifying the horrors that come about here, but you will know enough to see that these lovers are haunted by a longing for innocence that was taken from in so shocking ways that they cannot recover.  They do not become jaded; they want to restore innocence & heal each other (drawing our compassion) yet to do this, others (innocent, also craving love) are sacrificed in many ways, both in the common ways (leaving a child behind to advance family ""fortunes"") and in horrific ways.  It is a gorgeous film visually, something to gorge on -- with elements that only this extremely talented and entertaining director can get away with.... I don't want to spoil them by telling you.  I want to see every film she ever made or will make.  Further, I am already looking to see films by all the wonderful cast members.  Plus, great music, cinematography, and atmospherics.  There are no wasted moments in this film.  Things happen very quickly and you will know why without any dulling back-story or how these two lovers advance from place to place.  We are put into the immediate presence wherever they are.  Let me add that nothing is more horrific in many ways than a woman's barefoot lifting off the floor covered in blood while she tidies up the kitchen.  I think audiences who like<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B00DXOHR6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter: The Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;might like this, although I love this film way more.  Weirdly, but I think rightly, another film comes to mind -- not because it has horror, but because the film-maker is keenly aware of the longing for true intimacy and care that is at the heart of so much weird action between people who have been denied that or do not know how to find it -- that film is:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Pleasures-English-Subtitled/dp/B006DUK1K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Pleasures (English Subtitled)</a>, which was originally called LApollonide,"" then House of Tolerance,"" and now on Amazon ""House of Pleasures.""",1444953600,4,2838,5.447488584474886
8722118,5,B010CVV0EG,"Awesome yet disturbing/horror film that is totally worth watching if you have an open mind. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who enjoy the typical hollywood film that seem to copy/remake just about everything. Luckily, ""Alleluia"" is a unique foreign film that will keep you glued to the screen throughout the entire film.  I wish Hollywood could make unique original movies like ""Alleluia"" because foreign horror/thriller films have become WAY better than the typical hollywood horror/films. Anyways, I don't want to reveal the plot of this movie because I feel that it will possibly ruin the whole experience of watching this awesome foreign horror/thriller film. However, if you feel like spoiling yourself then you can just simply look it up via Google. Com. If you are a big fan of horror/thriller films then I would totally recommend this movie to you but then again some people can't watch a movie with foreign subtitles. Anyways, go ahead and rent this film since it's only $3.99 but I don't know how long it will remain at theb $3.99 price tag.",1441929600,5,1061,4.927374301675978
