2309767,5,B0009PLMAS,"A Placed Promised in Our Early Days is a great film. Not as good as its prequal, Voices of a Distant Star, but noteworthy nonetheless. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes touching stories. I also recommend this movie because it's the first major release of Japan's newest and greatest anime director, Makoto Shinkai. This young director has a gift for storytelling and a way of getting his point across that is lost in a lot of weaker anime. Love stories are good, but actually displaying the obvious love between the characters is very important. Makoto Shinkai does this in both his films, The Placed Promised in Our early Days and Voices of a Distant Star, making us not only believe in these character but wish that something would happen to bring them together. He's a master storyteller, and I can't wait to see what he's planning next. Look out Hayao Miyazaki. Buy this right alongside Voices of a Distant Star and you won't be disappointed.",1129680000,,955,4.724550898203593
2309768,5,B0009PLMAS,"Approaching this from the perspective of a sci-fi enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that, despite the complexity of its theories on divergent realities and their harmonic coexitence with dreams, there was a far simpler coming-of-age story that centered on a childhood promise. The score is haunting. The visuals and animation is stunning and the characters are charmingly awkward. Although their are some action sequences and a pint of blood thrown in for measure, the film's pace is decidedly that of a romantic reflection on loneliness and bittersweet affection. In the end the story telling is adequate, but viewers who were eager to be exposed to fantastic alternate universes will be disappointed.

2309769,2,B0009PLMAS,"The movie had great artwork and a score that can only be described as awesome, but these were muddied by the fact that the storyline was obscure and uninteresting. As a love story it failed in establishing a repoir between its main characters and as a story of war it failed in providing action scenes. As a scifi movie it left you wondering if maybe the science was left out in favor of the fiction. I give it two stars. One for the art, one for the music.",1126483200,8,457,4.204545454545454
2309770,2,B0009PLMAS,"Last year, I took ""CTCS403: East Asian Cinema"" at USC with Professor David James. Before showing us a film that might be considered unpalatable to our Western tastes, he'd preface by saying ""you're either going to like this film and have good taste, or you're not going to like it and have bad taste.""

Since taking that course, I struggle valiantly to appreciate (or even just comprehend) critically-acclaimed films that are not immediately accessible. Since this film trumped both Otomo's Steamboy and Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle for the honor of Best Animated Film at the prestigious Mainichi Film Awards, I was determined to glean the deeper meaning no matter what.

Other matters aside, you have to give The Place Promised in Our Early Days points for an interesting setting:

In an alternate history of the aftermath of World War II, Japan has been cleaved in half, with the south-Honshu and the other islands-allied with the United States and the northern island Hokkaido annexed by the enigmatic Union. It was on Hokkaido that a mysterious tower had been built, a strand of metal reaching up out of the atmosphere, visible from the northern tip of Honshu. In 1996, three teenagers, Hiroki, Takuya and Sayuri, make a pact-they will build an experimental aircraft, almost invisible to surveillance, cross over to Hokkaido and unlock the secrets of the tower. Their dream was never realized, because Sayuri was sent to Tokyo for treatment after she fell into a coma. It is now three years later. The rosy illusions of youth have fallen away, but not the unbreakable strength of the trio's promise. The truth of the tower will be uncovered, and with it, the link between it and Sayuri's mysterious, carefully tended condition.

Sadly, things fall apart in terms of cohesion almost immediately. For one thing, all of the characters are basically blanks in the personality department, making them all blend together. I can see how Shinkai is trying to make his tale seem more universal, but the technique just ends up distancing the viewer from onscreen events. That's not to say that these events are remotely approaching understandable, by the way. In regards to of any form of a plot, I can remember some half-baked metaphysical musings on parallel universes juxtaposed with some junior-high recollections. That's really about it.

BOTTOM LINE: There wasn't a single moment that my attention was engaged while watching, and to me that isn't a sign of quality. Accuse me of ""bad"" taste if you must.",1126396800,11,2506,5.0
2309771,5,B0009PLMAS,"""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" is set in a fictional version of modern Japan. After World War II, Japan was split in two, like Korea. The southern section was occupied by the United States and the northern section by a force called simply ""Union."" Union builds a huge tower on the island of Hokkaido. Its purpose is a mystery, but it can be seen as far away as Tokyo. Tensions build, and war between north and south seems inevitable.

Two middle school students, Hiroki and Takuya, have found an abandoned drone aircraft and have plans to repair it and fly it to the mysterious Tower. On a summer's day, they make a promise to their schoolmate Sayuri that they will take her to the Tower with them in the aircraft that they call ""Bela &#264;ielo."" Then, the girl suddenly leaves the town without saying goodbye, and Hiroki and Takuya end up going to high school in different cities. Three years pass. The aircraft and the promise are all but forgotten. Takuya, as a high school senior, works for a government research lab that is trying to crack the secret of the Tower. Hiroki becomes a loner, attending high school in Tokyo but remaining separate from everyone else. He is haunted by a recurring dream: Sayuri is in a place alone, literally in pain from loneliness, and he is looking for her but cannot find her.

The one flaw I found is that the science-fiction background story has some plot holes that cannot survive close examination. However, that one flaw certainly did not hurt my enjoyment of the relationship between Hiroki, Takuya, and Sayuri. I found their characters complex and their interactions compelling.

The great strength of this movie is that Shinkai has a heart for his characters. He knows just how to communicate his love for them to the audience. When Hiroki and Sayuri tell of each other's loneliness, you can feel that loneliness as if it were your own.

Shinkai`s artwork is cutting edge and his backgrounds provide realistic stages for his characters. Before I watched this, I had read that he does amazings things with light and I find that to be true. The movie also highlights Tenmon's music that adds to the poetry of each scene. The closing theme song, ""Kimi no Koe (Your Voice)"" is among the prettiest songs I have ever heard.",1126224000,5,2271,4.684210526315789
2309772,4,B0009PLMAS,"After watching the preview on the Anime Network, I decided to try out this title. Usually not being a fan of most anime movies (I'm more interesting in on-going series), I was surprised that this title appealed to me. I was a little disappointed, however, after watching the film.

The artwork and animation is beautiful, and the music is also wonderful. But for the most part, the movie is just pretty quiet and peaceful as it follows the lives of the three main characters. The story is thought-provoking and interesting, but it seemed like I was always waiting for something big to happen. The plot was a little slow, and sometimes I didn't quite understand the reasons behind some of the things that happened.

Overall it's a good movie, and definitely worth watching. It's just a bit slow-moving, and the action isn't on a very high-scale.",1123200000,5,844,4.773972602739726
2309773,5,B0009PLMAS,"I wanted to see this ever since I heard that it was done by the same director who created Voices of a Distant Star, and I have to say that it lived up to my expectations.

Every single frame of this piece looks as though it could be framed on the wall as art. It looks amazing. The attention to detail is astonishing.

But Promise is not just eye-candy. There is a story, told in subdued tones, and supported by a rich, lovely score.

A complex blend of romance, drama, and science-fiction, the narration on both the Japanese and English tracks is perfect.

This is a film that will change anime the same way that Akira did, but for vastly different reasons.",1122163200,23,658,4.368852459016393
2309774,5,B0009PLMAS,"After seeing the trailer at the ADV website, and knowing it was another Shinkai movie, I had to see this one, and it was just as good as I thought it would be. Hell, I'm almost willing to call it the best I've seen in the last few years. I can see now why some call Shinkai the next Miyazaki...if you think that is blasphemous to say, you ought to check out his works before judging that for yourself.

As much as I enjoyed Voices of A Distant Star (Hoshi no Koe), I found it too short. His animation style, the colors, the computer effects were all amazing...and even more so that he did the whole thing by himself.

Then he comes up with this masterpiece. Voices had an okay plot, but wasn't too terribly developed or interesting. This one is spectacular. It everything that Voices should have been...full length, proffessional looking, same beautiful use of computers to enhance colors, Shinkai's little trick of using real places in Japan to draw out buildings...it just blew me away.

Any anime fan looking for something fresh and beautiful should check this out, it is well worth the small amount of cash it will cost you. And if you are fortunate enough to live in one of the cities where its being shown in the theaters, I highly encourage you to see it there on the big screen.

The story is about three children and their quest to greater know the world they live in. This alternate universe takes place after WWII, except here the island of Honshu (the main island of Japan) and all southern islands came under US occupation, and the northern most island Hokaido came under control of the mysterious ""Union"", who in 1974 erected an enourmous tower for an unknown purpose. The two boys, and the one girl they both loved, Sayuri, promised each other that some day they would fly to that tower in the plane they built.

But then Sayuri falls into a mysterious coma, and the promise is delayed... I won't spoil the story, but needless to say its quite terrific and the ending quite satisfying.

Enjoy this one for yourself, trust me when I say its worth every penny.",1121558400,50,2073,4.529411764705882

I expected it to be great, if not greater. Well... it wasn't... in fact it was no where near as good.

The animation is very well done but is ""over done"" with every scene seeped in sepias, moonlight etc which I found soon got tiresome. The sci-fi plot is a strange mix of quantum mechanical dream state mumbo jumbo and parallel universes; which while rather silly (sorry all you parapsychologists) is at least quasi-interesting.

*Spoilers*

The problem with philosophical movies is that one person's ""Oh my, wasn't that deep and mysterious"" moment is another person's ""Good grief, this is boring, tedious, and inane"", and sometimes there's just no rhyme or reason to it besides differences in character, history, and experiences between the two people. And then the person who didn't like the film goes on Amazon and explains why they didn't like it in order to aid people in their purchasing decisions, and inevitably comes off looking like a jerk for 'hating' on someone's favorite movie.

And yet, here we are. I wanted to like ""Place Promised"", I really did. Firstly, and while this shouldn't *matter*, it's still very impressive, the movie is absolutely gorgeous. Seriously, this is some of the prettiest anime I've ever seen - there's a scene where a ladybug alights on a girl's hand, and it's so lovely I just want to cry. And, really, I *love* the plot premise - the horror of being totally alone in an alternate reality that you can't wake from is exactly the kind of plot premise that messes deeply with your mind for weeks on end. As well as the dual persona of the two boys - do they save their friend and risk the world, or do they sacrifice an innocent for mankind?

So why two stars? Honestly, despite all this I just didn't enjoy the movie. The characters are so bland and badly characterized that I couldn't get into it and just ended up being frustrated. The boys in particular stand out for me - their characters are so poorly fleshed out, and so superficially similar, that I actually thought a Big Reveal was going to be that they were both two personalities for the same person, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B001992NUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>, but no - it just turned out that they were poorly characterized and I wasn't supposed to notice.

The horror angle, also, which seemed so promising, was badly botched for me by the handling and execution. I don't demand complete realism in movies, but it would be nice to have SOME kind of Applied Phlebotinum to explain why all this is happening, outside of a bland, ""Well, her grandfather worked on the tower..."", explanation that explains nothing. Not to mention that the horror fell kind of flat when the researchers discovered so quickly and blandly what was going on - it's hard to feel that she's isolated and alone when everyone in the outside world knows her situation (even if that distinction doesn't make a difference to her).

Indeed, so MUCH of this movie just seems to be a ""Simon says"" of narrative acceptance. The populace at large regard the tower to be little more than an uncomfortable reminder of war or a lovely piece of scenery, which is so inhumanly bovine as to hurl you out of the movie on a catapult. I mean, imagine if we had a brutal war with Mexico or Cuba and then afterward they built a tower that stretched as far as the eye could see and could, oh I-don't-know, be used to stage long-range attacks against us at any point in time. I'm pretty sure the population's overall feeling towards it wouldn't be 'oooh, it's so shiny today!'. That's not even getting into the whole parallel universe thing - why would you want to overlap our world with a parallel universe? What's the goal? The point? Why is the government funding this operation? How did the tower sync up with our poor, beleaguered girl? We don't get answers to these things and while some people are going to find the lack of answers to be ""deep"" and ""meaningful"", it just rubbed me wrong in this particular case.

And, really, my intention is not to troll. If you loved this movie, good on you. But if you haven't seen this movie yet and are considering buying it at full price, take this review as a recommendation to rent first. That's all.

2309780,3,B0009PLMAS,"I bought this dvd on a whim one day since the animation quality and the art looked superb.  I also noticed that the director was a recent award winner.

I didn't even open it up until well around five or six months of owning it, after seeing mixed reviews on the internet.  I finally watched it with a friend of mine, and we sat through it as an obligation to finish the movie.  By the end I think both of us were on our laptops or doing something else.

As I was promised by the dvd case, the art and animation quality is astounding.  At some points objects or train rides look real and seem to pop off the screen.  The music, minus a few violin solos in the movie, was almost as good.  The whole slice of life part also seemed interesting and realistic enough.  That was where the goodness ended.

The movie starts off with a new girl at school or something and her grandfather was apparently a main constructor or planner of this tower in the distance.  Ironically, two friends have been working to build a plane and fly over and to the top of it someday.  The boys agree to let her help, but then this imminent war and the boys' graduation halt their plans.  The girl goes into a coma a couple years later, and these scientists have concluded that it's connected with the tower, and the side that has her wants to keep her asleep.  From what I gathered it's so they can find the appropriate data to see where dreams come from and how to gain the upper hand in the battle.  Or something like that.  The boys reunite, and try to figure out the right thing to do.  Guess what, it means they finally get to finish their plane.  But battleships have already started to congregate in the water they have to cross to the tower, and things are looking ugly.

The slice of life part with the three main protagonists as younger high school students eventually seemed to overstay its welcome.  The characters didn't seem all to fleshed out, or at least you never really felt any joy or agony for them.  The two boys are supposed to be on different sides, but for some odd reason some dumb plot hole or something happens and they make amends.  The whole opposite sides part doesn't even seem to take place, not to mention the two sides battling and the war is confusing and uninteresting anyway.  There's a war going on between one side of Japan and another that remained loyal to America after WWII.  It's supposed to be in an alternate history where Japan divided in two after the war.  However, with the dub at least, they didn't seem to feel the sting of it unless it numbed out over the years supposed of conflict and barricading.  It tries bringing science into into the movie, but it doesn't make you any more interested than before.  Actually, the scenes seemed dragged out and that was one of the reasons why it got a worse rating on the boring level.  You hardly know who's who at a point, and then they're bringing in too much to the plot with these people without time to explain or justify it.  There's supposed to be some love triangle between the protagonists, but even that seems underplayed or not taken full advantage of.  In the end, the way one behaves is really a letdown for anyone seeking conflict here.

There is an aerial battle right near the end.  That was about the best part, next to a few scenes of the kids as younglings.  There is one casualty that happens to almost land on the protagonists as they try to make their way under this battle and to the tower, and it is semi-realistic.  I guess if they manage to destroy it or get the comatose girl to wake up or something the two armies will eventually come to an agreement or make amends.  However, the main disappointment, though the illustration of the tower is also a good thing to behold, is you don't know what all finally happened in the end.  You're left on a rather dull cliffhanger of sorts that you just have to imagine or assume things.

So, in the end, watch it if you're bored and you like highly artistic, eye-popping anime.  The whole school years cliche seems to go on for too long and then the plot is suddenly thrown at you.  By then, and the way it's played out, you're bored anyway.

A+ for Art and music.
B in ""promised"" story that could have been more interesting, I think we've seen plots similar to this before.

2309782,5,B0009PLMAS,"The first best piece of art I've experienced in awhile across all mediums. While the characters are not complex, the story itself not brilliant, and the movie isn't very entertaining in the classical sense, its refined and done in a way to display everything clearly and beautifully. Some artists try and create there own world or own concepts and attempt to create something beautiful with complex ideals, characters with ""depth"", careful dialogue, or any other mindlessly dynamic ""virtue"" that the general public looks for in art. Makoto Shinkai creates something beautiful by not fabricating it but capturing it. It is not trying to make a statement, entertain, but just show something simple and beautiful. Something like a flower is beautiful but when you marvel at it you are not thinking about the complex system of photosynthesis by which it lives, there is just something about it that makes it beautiful that is impossible to define. This movie is beautiful in just the same way, the character dynamics and the story are there just to capture the beauty of a particular relationship. Makoto Shinkai has a refined style that keeps the story or the world surrounding the characters from distracting the viewer, he does something that seems virtually impossible for most artists today, he completely forgets about being entertaining, and I say that as a complement. All I can say is that it is a flawless work. Such subtly is lost among my generations popular art.",1236470400,,1471,5.0081632653061225

2309784,5,B0009PLMAS,"Back in 2002, Makoto Shinkai won an award as ""Most Valuable Newcomer"" at the Tokyo Anime Fair 21 for his film ""Voices of a Distant Star"".

  What made this film so different from many anime out there was that it was created only by a staff of one and that was Shinkai Makoto, himself.

  Using a Power Macintosh 7600/120 computer and various consumer and professional design and animation software, he was able to write, direct and create an animation so beautiful that it was difficult to believe that one man was responsible for it.

  Now, Makoto is back with another award winning animated film titled ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days"".

  The film takes place after the Second World War, with Japan now divided into two factions.

  Honshu and the rest of the Southern Islands came under the sovereignty of the United States and Hokkaido was annexed by ""Union"".

  In 1996, an unsual tower was created South of Honshu and Its purpose is unkown.

  In the Aomori prefecture (Northern Japan), the storyline focuses on three friends  who made a vow to fly an airplane to the tower and find out its secrets.
  Two programmers and their friend Sayuri made a promise that was meant to be kept until something happened to Sayuri and the promise was broken.
  The film features three main parts.  Focusing on the characters as they make the promise.

  The next focuses on the lives of the individuals three years later, on how a broken promise has set two of the main characters into two different paths in their lives, one working for the Southern Islands as a master hacker and the other who has not fully adjusted because his love for Sayuri and feels empty without her.

  And the third and final part which focuses on the two friends as they are put into opposing paths and the answer to Sayuri's connection with the tower.

  If you thought Makoto Shinkai did amazing things with his first film, ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days"" is a glimpse of what Makoto can do with a full staff and potential for the future.  Absolutely amazing!

  The attention to detail on the animation is very well done.  There is strong attention to detail for buildings, outdoor scenery and vehicles which are well done.

  Even the audio was a pleasure to listen to and the surround sound is well done.

  I've heard noises may it be rain or subtle noises used effectively on my rear speakers.  Very nice!

  Of course, with a beautiful looking and sounding film, it wouldn't make a whole lot of difference if the storyline is bad.  Fortunately, the storyline of this film is quite good.

  It's not to difficult to understand and it could have been ""Ghost in the Shell"" cerebral but fortunately, it doesn't go that far.

  As for the DVD special features, the original Japanese trailer collection is included.  You also  get the interviews with the Japanese cast and an interview with director, Makoto Shinkai.

  I may be a bit biased towards Makoto's work because I'm amazed of how one man has inspired so many people with creating an anime by himself and the potential shown through this film.

  ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days"" is a film that doesn't disappoint and fortunately has a good balance via storyline, animation and with sound.

2309785,4,B0009PLMAS,"Some other-world Japan has been split in two, like our world's Korea. War hasn't broken out yet, but everyone feels the impending, inevitable start of hostilities, as if war had some life of its own, independent of the humans who fight and die in it. Then, just across the border, the other side has erected a mysterious tower, a needle that pierces the sky.

This is the backdrop against which people live their lives and against which children go to school, with that silent, shining tower standing above them all. It's where three friends struggle towards adulthood, and see their struggles crushed under forces they can't control - but maybe ...

You'll have to see this for yourself. Science fiction elements contribute to this movie, but only as background. The story really revolves around the human need for a little beauty, friendship, and personal challenge in a world where such things become increasingly hard to find Although emotion gets a little overheated in one or two places, it's the personal drama that pulls the viewer in.

2309786,5,B0009PLMAS,"Motoko Shinkai has been hailed as the greatest animation genius to come out of Japan since Miyazaki himself. He made his first widely hailed success on his iMac and did the voice-acting himself. It was called Voices of a Distant Star, at less than an hour in length, it was the greatest story of light-speed time-delay since Gunbuster, a Mecha sci-fi that focused on two (literally) star-crossed lovers and their battle against time and for the salvation of the human race, when all they really wanted was to be together. Every since that film, people have been clamoring for more of that magic. Well the day has come, complete with orchestral music, and a full motion-picture budget. Was the first feature-length vision of the great Shinkai worth waiting for? Yes indeed!

Voices of a Distant Star was an epic in miniature, a tale of love between the stars expressed through time and space on a cell phone (literally!). It struck a chord with myriads of fans across the globe by making the epic extremely personal, making us wonder if the love between two teenagers in the end might be more important than a war across the universe. No Shinkai again creates a deeply personal epic, but of a slightly different nature. Both films create an enormous feeling of lonliness as star-crossed loves drift apart and a quiet desperation sinks in, Voices was highly tragic, while the feeling this film conveys is more one of triumph and salvation, through the belief that there is still time to fulfill life's promises, and there is always the chance to start again.

At its outset the film introduces us to a world where Japan is divided much the way German once was, with the two sides locked in a cold war. On one side are two friends working to build their own aircraft (and the girl who fascinates them both). On the other side lies an immense tower that they want to reach with the plane they are building. It's a peaceful, beautiful, tranquil world, but flashes of future events fill one with a sense or foreboding, just before we fast-forward to a time of impending destruction...

The friends grow up and drift apart. One enters into research and the other goes to the city to study at a university. Here the differences in their personalities which were at first subtle now seem like night and day, as the more stoic and studious one is getting involved in the razer-edge political climate and the daydreamer finds himself in danger of completely losing his grip on reality. And that's where the real drama kicks in.

You see that mysterious tower is a weapon of mass destruction, capable of rewriting the world with an alternate one...one where there are no people. And somehow that tower is connected to the girl, who has fallen into a deep sleep. But like in Voices of a Distant Star, the real story is one of the connection between two people across time and space, and dimensions. Not long before I saw this film I had an idea. What if our dreams were really a portal to other dimensions? While the two friends are pursuing their destinies, the idealistic one starts to hear her calling to him from far far away, from the dimension where her mind is trapped while her body sleeps. She is all alone and desperately searching for him to save her. And the thought that speaks to me most, is one I see again and again in Japanese stories. Often those who seem weakest are really the strongest. This girl who is so mild, soft-spoken, sweet, and fragile. And the only thing between the world and total annihilation is her will holding back the tower...

As she starts to wake up, and the nations head toward all-out war, the friends must reunite, and decide the ultimate fate of the world, as one tries to save the girl he loves, and the other tries to save the world.

This film is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen in my life. Voices of a Distant Star was gorgeous, with orange and purple hues over everything making it a world of perpetual sunset. But that short film was made by one man on his iMac. This film was made by a team of animators with a real feature film budget. And it certainly shows. The animation is much higher quality, with less sill shots and more natural-looking characters. Each and every frame is a work of art, with everything bathed in a perpetual sunrise pallet of colors. On a good TV, particularly if you have a progressive-scan dvd player. The music too is quite beautiful, with the main violin theme being perhaps as memorable as the piano them from Voices. Even with the greatly upgraded visuals, you can still very clearly see the director's tradmark style. Often you see objects in close view or tremendous vitas, and the characters are part of the world rather than standing out from it.
There are shots where you seem to focus on some small detail such as reflections on a ceiling or glittering lights, the passing of shadows. It gives everything a very dreamlike storybook quality, and I have often thought that Shinkai has to be trying tell the story completely with the visuals, as if we should still understand the feelings, thoughts, and emotions of the characters even without words.

Some people might be turned down by some of the more hard sci-fi aspects, such as the talk about alternate dimensions, and the technobabble about building the plane. And doubtless some will grow bored with the slow pace of the film. But the narrative power of Shinkai's creations is hard to ignore, and the visual splendor presented is unsurpassed. This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. I can't wait for Shinkai's next film.",1198281600,3,5568,4.646700507614213
2309787,5,B0009PLMAS,"Makoto Shinkai's The Place Promised in Our Early Days takes place in the late 1990s in Japan in an alternate timeline.  The story follows two boys (Hiroki and Takuya) who both like the same girl (Sayuri).  At the beginning of the film, they areall 8th grade students.  The boys find the remains of a drone plane, which they have named the Bella Ciela.  They take part-time jobs at a factory, where their boss helps them scrounge for spare parts to rebuild the drone plane.  The boys promise Sayuri that after the plane is rebuilt, they will take her to visit the mysterious tower on Hokkaido.  However, before this happens, Sayuri mysteriously disappears.

It's three years later, and the boys have stopped working on the plane.  One of them is now a student in Tokyo, while the other is working as a physicist.  Meanwhile, Sayuri has been hospitalized due to an extreme form of narcolepsy.  It is believed her condition has something to do with the tower on Hokkaido.  Both of the boys learn what has happened to Sayuri, but have very different ideas what needs to be done. They need to decide whether it's more important to save Sayuri or save the world.

The animation in the film is lush and very realistic-looking.  And the music perfectly portrays what happens in the film.  This is a very touch and moving coming-of-age story.  I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys character-driven anime drama.",1196812800,2,1407,4.732510288065844

Set in an alternate world where Japan has been split in two after the Second World War, the US controls the southern end, while a mysterious government known as the Union controls the north. Located in the north is the mystical Union Tower, an enormous structure jutting into the sky like a beam of light, a symbol of love and hate for those who gaze upon its magnificent height. This is the coming of age story of three middle school children Hiroki, Takuya, and Sayuri, who grew up their whole lives dreaming of visiting the tower and spent their time building an airplane in order to do just that.

The first thirty minutes of this film are very stunning, both visually and emotionally. It plays out almost exactly like Voices of a Distant Star does, with stunning animation, peaceful and touching music and the characters relationships with each other being the focus of the film. although the story itself doesn't stand up to scrawny and seems as if it were hacked together without much thought put into it, the combination of the visuals and the musical score are very moving. Few animes have actually wowed me with their animation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;was one such movie; this took the cake. This movie has the most stunning animation I have ever seen in an animated film, bar none. its hard to explain with words just what I mean, the sun setting behind the glow of the Union Tower, far off streaks of light shining off an airplane, a small white dove flying in a cool breeze as trees sway around it, its all done with such dedication and detail that it left me speechless. Combined with one of the best soundtracks ever composed for a feature film and this movie have the power to bring people to tears on its sheer beauty alone. Could this be the new Miyazaki? I said no in my Voices of a Distant Star review, but if this is what this new director is capable of then he may be.

Unfortunately, this movies story is very hacked up, as if during many points of this film the director intended to end it and just decided to add more later. This movie has more endings then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JKZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Widescreen Edition)</a>. While I love the ending this movie had, the rest of the film didn't flow the way a feature length film should, it didn't transfer smoothly from one scene to the next; instead it simply ended a scene with a black screen, and started up somewhere else completely without setting up the next shot. This caused the story to feel clumsy, as if the director didn't know where he wanted to go or what he wanted to do once he got there. The middle part of this movie just sort of plods along without any real sense of direction. It's like he wanted to make a short film, like Voices of a Distant Star, but decided to stretch it out as far as he could. The movie really could have been half and hour, or more, shorter then it was. Not to say that most of it is filler, but if he managed to fit a story the size and scope of Voices into 23 minutes, then I'm sure he could have fit this movie into 40. Also, a lot of the movie is never really explained. What is the Union Tower exactly? What is the Union? Why is there such a desire for the two nations to go to war? All these questions are left unanswered at the end of the film. It is only when this film focuses mainly on the story instead of on creating beautiful images and developing its characters that it gets dull. there really isn't much story to hold this movie together during its slower and less grand moments, which becomes a problem 3/4ths of the way though when the story takes front stage in all its hacked up glory. Fortunately, the director seems to know this and keeps the story in the background as much as possibly, only bringing it into focus when he needs to get the characters from point A to point B.

What saves this movie from being nothing more then a good looking and sounding mess (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira-Special-Edition/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira (Special Edition)</a>) was the relationships between the characters involved. Much like in Voices, this story is a romance of sorts but doesn't fall into the ""chick flick"" category. It's about the love three friends have for each other, and the length they were willing to go for each other in order to fulfill a promise they made while still little kids. It's very interesting to watch how each slowly fell into depression and felt like their lives were losing meaning when they weren't with each other. When one of themes disappears, they lose their dreams, ambitions, and slowly drift apart. Like any good piece of fiction, the characters are what make this movie so touching.

If you enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star, then you will enjoy The Place Promised in Our Early Days. Its visuals, characters, and soundtrack make this movies a must see for sure, but its hacked up story prevents it from being a truly great film. If this director can learn how to write a story that can match up with his amazing animation, then watch out world, anime might very well have a new director to take the place of the great Miyazaki when he finally retires. I look forward to seeing more movies by this upcoming guineas.

2309793,3,B0009PLMAS,"This review is not intended as the final word on this film -- but primarily just a quick note to say that reviews making comparisons with Miyazaki should not mislead you into thinking this film will be as well-appreciated or understood by children as Miyazaki's films.  Obviously, there are several fans of anime who love this film, and I can see some of the reasons why.  I got this film, though, mostly for my children who love everything they have seen from Studio Ghibli, and did so on the strength of comparisons in the reviews posted here and elsewhere with the work of Miyazaki.  As it turned out, though, my kids became quite bored halfway through this film and lost interest in seeing it to the end.  I kept it on, but found myself drifting a bit as well.

The visuals were stunning -- as good as any I have seen in animation. I also thought the story held promise and was overall touching, but also suffered from what seemed to me to be contradictory aims.  On the one hand, the filmmakers seemed to want a simple story about childhood friendships and dreams, that can be lost sight of for a time but possibly recaptured.  On the other hand, the filmmakers wanted a strong science fiction premise that explored the possibility of alternate realities.  I don't think either aspect worked as well as it could have.  The plot is not really, though, the main problem that I saw with this film; I think it had more to do with a feeling that the characters never felt to me as if they had been brought to life.  Some of the early sequences reminded me of the simple evocations of childhood and wonder found in Studio Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart"" -- but what carried that movie all the way through was the personalities and overall interest of the characters.  By contrast, I never felt very connected to the characters in this film, and my children didn't either.  My children's response to the film did not seem to have as much to do with the complicated storyline as its failure to create truly memorable and likeable characters.  Shinkai is a talented artist who creates beautiful and inspiring images, and I will certainly keep an eye out for his future films -- I hope that in the future he can collaborate with a storyteller who can help him bring his stories to life through the characters.",1165968000,,2304,4.549636803874092

Will the promise be kept? Well, that's what shapes the rest of the film in a visually stunning and unusual way.

From the very beginning the movie draws you in with the way it unfolds. The breathtaking scenery and the mesmerising background score leaves you speechless. Fans of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films will undoubtedly love this movie since it almost has the same beauty and depth as their films. The dreamlike scenery, open spaces, lush backgrounds of the film transports the viewer to the alternate universe which the film talks about. The artwork of the film is absolutely stunning, one of the best I've ever seen. The story becomes more and more complex as things unfold hence a second viewing may be in store.

2309797,5,B0009PLMAS,"Does a plot have to be complex and so deep with meaning to be great?  Does it have to have a moral message to render it meaningful?  Does it have to entertain with the biggest bombast that you can throw on screen?  I think not.  If your idea of great filmmaking has to answer all these questions with a ""yes,"" then you might be missing the big picture.

To start off, ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" is not a science fiction film.  Rather, it's a simple story with sci-fi elements.  Yes, the parallel universes plot device sort of comes out of nowhere, feeling a bit tacked on to give validity to the events that happen later on, but it works in the end since it re-enforces what the movie is trying to say:  The greatest promise friends can give, is the promise that they will never stop loving.

While the story is not without its flaws, the movie succeeds in the end.  What most people don't get is that there is no real ""enemy"" here.  You can't pinpoint and say ""Ah ha!  I see a bad guy.""  There isn't one.  The real antagonist is the loss of innocence and what people have to do to reconnect to that simplicity that was once in our childhood.  So when people say that there isn't any action in the film, I think that they aren't really looking at what the film is really trying to convey.

But the little action that is in here is still pretty to look at.

The animation here is top-notch and it harkens back to Shinkai's first work ""Voices..."" but on a much grander scale.  Everything is bright and colorful without being saturated in hyper-vibrancy.  It juxtaposes well with the intimacy that these characters have for each other.

The music just adds to this rich palette.  The solo violin piece played through out the film creates this warmth that actually accentuates the colors of the film.  It's hard to describe, but the piece adds its own color to the beautiful animation.

Overall, this movie made me realize that a story, as simple as this one, could resonate to anyone that is willing to see the bigger picture.  Friendship, love and the dreams of childhood, transcend the difficulties and realities of life.",1155168000,5,2132,4.477922077922078

In truth, this may not necessarily be accurate.  The art has fantastic detail, the pace DOES feel slower than Miyazaki's works.  That being said, I think in order to draw out the kind of feelings the viewer gets from seeing the work, the pacing is part of the design, and probably intentional.

My only complaint is that we need MORE anime like this, to a wider audience.  You want to prove anime is not just the cartoon network or saturday morning stereotypes, but can engage the viewer on many levels, with a emotionally deep story, this is the movie.

A side, and somewhat humorous argument could be that this sort of anime may be the ultimate answer to making geeky guys watch the equivalent of a chick flick and LIKE IT.

2309802,5,B0009PLMAS,"This movie features and follows a number of characters as it unfolds, but the main characters are two youngsters (a male and a female) who have feelings for one another in a pre-war Japan. Seemingly oblivious to the turmoil erupting, they both look off into the sky toward a huge, thin, silver sliver of hope - the ""tower.""

As the story unfolds we learn that the tower links dimensions and is somehow threatening to destroy the world as we know it. Erupting warfare also occurs but all this is handled like a background story - for the main characters are still intent upon reaching their ""promised land"" (the land essentially surrounding the tower, encompassing the tower as well).

The bulk of the story takes place after the children have grown up and mysteriously the female character that one of the main male characters was attracted to in his youth suddenly falls into a coma. Without giving any more away, this story is about reaching her in much the same way Voices of a Distant Star was about the communication between two young loves across a war and worlds.

Thematic elements are similar between Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. Both movies feature innocent love, the battle of love lost, and a supportive art style which contributes to Shinkai's film's emotionally engaging story.

Shinkai does it again this time out-doing himself with amazing animation, soundtrack, and excellent captivating and emotional storyline. Between Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days, Makoto Shinkai proves himself as one of the greatest Japanese animators. Extras show his transition from working solo to working with a whole team... his transition also marks a transition in his work from simply amazing to downright unparalleled.

In my opinion the plot was not all that confusing, what was slightly confusing was the order in which the older versions of the young characters appeared in the story. When the progression in time was made I mistook various characters for what I thought was their older counterparts, this was a mistake on my part but one which I think would be common since the real main male character (Hiroki), as an adult, was introduced much later than I expected.

There was one review in which the reviewer stated how the subtitles in the American DVD version of the film were off, this is incorrect... there are no flaws on the DVD whatsoever, and simply to make sure I triple checked the subtitles on the copy of the DVD which I own (a simple task for me), not a single error. Either the reviewer was not referring to this edition of the DVD or a later revision of the DVD was released after his review was posted.

This is a great film I think all fans of anime would benefit from seeing (and enjoy quite a bit), I highly doubt there is any difference like some reviewers suggest in a Japanese audiences opinion compared to the American audiences opinion - love, innocent love is innocent love - I think that the intelligent viewer and anime enthusiast will enjoy this film just as much as I have.

8064765,3,B0009PLMAS,"Makoto Shinkai makes beautiful films. Sun drenched skies, gorgeous clouds and wind-swept fields are all part of his signature style and every film he makes is truly amazing. He also makes very smart anime films. His works are not typical mecha slug fests, samurai beat em ups or silly harem shows that often make up the bulk of anime content. Instead, his films are more introspective, thought provoking and solicit an emotional response from the viewer. I have been a fan of his work since ""voices of a distant star"" and after watching ""children who chase lost voices"" I decided to go back and re-watch his previous works. After viewing it again ""the place promised in our early days"" is in my opinion his weakest.

""The place promised.."" is a science fiction story about an alternate history where Japan is split into north and south. The north has constructed a mysterious tower that can be seen by everyone in the south. Three school friends dream about what the tower is and build a plane in hopes of flying to the tower. As time moves on the dynamics of friendship changes and the promise to go to the tower fades as life changes. What makes this film so weak is indeed the characterization and pacing. The two main male characters are never fully fleshed out, the female character is presented as a weaker girl and we never really get the sense that any of them are great friends. In fact there isn't a real deep connection between any of the characters. Instead of character development we are treated to long scenes filled with gorgeous landscapes, train stations and endless soliloquies. While the characters inner thoughts give us an idea of how they view their world there's very little happening in the film and the plot itself never fully materializes. In between these character speeches Makoto adds scenes filled with political and science fiction jargon but those scenes while giving us info about the tower aren't quite cohesive enough to pull the story together.

Overall, the film is absolutely gorgeous but for me was not entertaining. There are lots of great anime films that are able to be philosophical as well as entertain. Certainly films by Satoshi Kon and Katsuhiro Otomo works are evident of that. Having said that this was the first full length film by Makoto Shinkai and his abilities as a storyteller were growing. His next two films ""5cm per second"" and ""children who chase lost voices"" proved to be amazing films. ""the place promised.."" isn't a horrible film but for me it was the least enjoyable.",1353801600,2,2531,4.776255707762557
8064766,4,B0009PLMAS,"This is a really good anime. Three childhood friends promise to fly a homade airplane across the sea to explore a giant tower. But one of them falls into a coma and disappears. They are torn apart by tragedy and struggle through their adult lives. This movie is really good but I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c there is a similar movie out there that is much better. It's called 5 Centimeters Per Second. It actually made me cry. I'm not trying to turn you off of this film but If you haven't seen 5 Centimeters Per Second watch it first, then move on to The place Promised in Our Early Days. They are both very good.",1348963200,,615,4.220338983050848
8064767,4,B0009PLMAS,"Being a HUGE Studio Ghibli fan I found this film recommended and decided to give it a try. It's a beautiful animation! The details are gorgeous. Visually speaking this movie is a 5 star. I took 1 star away though for the storyline itself. It is choppy and confusing and leaves the viewer questioning what it's all about really. You get the jest, but it could have been done better. Definitly watch for it's beauty, but don't expect a lot from the storyline itself.",1302048000,,464,4.535714285714286
8064768,4,B0009PLMAS,"`The Place Promised In Our Early Days' is another masterful animation from Makoto Shinkai. This follows three young adults as they live in the time just before a war and how one of them, Sayuri, is linked to a tall tower they can see in the distance and which is connected to the coming conflict. This film looks at a promise made and how it is finally carried out. It is hard to give more detail without spoiling the film. This film has some beautiful animation, especially the backgrounds and the attention to detail is very impressive. The play of sunlight on objects and as characters move through sunlight really stood out. This has more traditional animation than in Shinkai's previous film `Voices of a Distant Star' (which had lots of obviously computer animated scenes) and I found it easier to watch as a result. This film has some wonderful 'camera' angles and scenes that made it feel more cinematic and like a film than an anime, it feels very polished and well thought out. This has a slight romantic edge to the story and softened the more hard edge, military themed aspects of the film and complimented it very well overall. The extras include interviews with the Japanese cast and director. This is a beautifully crafted film and if you are fan of either Shinkai or anime in general this is well worth considering.
