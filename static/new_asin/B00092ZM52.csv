8056908,3,B00092ZM52,"If only there was more on this DVD than two episodes and an SCTV Remembers with Joe Flaherty, Andrea Martin (My Big Fat Greek Wedding), Eugene Levy (American Pie) and Catherine O'Hara (Home Alone).

The first episode of this satirical variety series more like ""Saturday Night Live"" was entitled ""One on the Town"" with ninety minutes aired on NBC including ""Leave It To Beaver"" 25th anniversary where the Beaver and the cast are all grown up with John Candy as the Beaver; ""Masterpiece Theatre: All the Long-Leggedy Beasties"" and ""Play it Again, ""Bob"" with Rick Moranis as Woody Allen and Dave Thomas playing Bob Hope. That was the best parody in this episode and a performance from Levon Helm.

The second episode is entitled ""Polynesiantown"" with a Japanese talk show host interviews Grogan; a Russian weightlifter gets his own variety show and video DJ Gerry Todd makes his debut. ""The 5 Neat Guys"" promo spot for clean cut music; ""The Sammy Maudlin Show"" on drugs in Hollywood. I just loved watching Catherine O'Hara's Lola Heatherton and Andrea Martin's Mother Teresa as a guest on the show. She doesn't have to say anything but her facial expression are just priceless. I also loved Martin playing Indira Gandhi in a parody ""Evita"" with Indira and co-star Slim Whitman. Another sketch of the ""Great White North"" with Mackenzie brothers.

 ""Polynesiatown"" film sendup and a final crane shot. If you love satire, you will love ""SCTV"" especially here.",1502064000,,1453,4.942622950819672

8056913,5,B00092ZM52,"This compilation of two SCTV episodes from its second incarnation (on NBC) shows why the show was such a fan-favorite.  Some of the best comedic talents of the day show us how sketch comedy--done right--can really work.
Eugene Levy, John Candy, Catherine O'Hara, and Rick Moranis really shine in this collection.
I plan to see if the original Canadian episodes are available long before next Christmas!",1356912000,3,402,5.090909090909091
