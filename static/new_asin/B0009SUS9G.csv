His talent is endless, and his energy the same.  (I wore myself out just watching the show!)  The second DVD is just as good.",1135296000,10,277,4.169811320754717

8066341,5,B0009SUS9G,"Christian clean humor--taylor's a riot and gets the audience involved. check him out on the ""Thou shalt laugh"" dvd's. I love his puppets.",1394409600,,137,5.0
8066342,5,B0009SUS9G,Great for a good laugh and clean fun.  Taylor Mason can really make them talk.  Funniest when he has volunteers come up on stage.,1386201600,,129,4.333333333333333
8066343,5,B0009SUS9G,The extended version is a much better show than the TV show version. I thought this was one of Taylor's strongest performances.,1359590400,,127,4.818181818181818
8066344,2,B0009SUS9G,Not all that funny. Parts were funny but and other banabas video were good but this one wasn't for me that's not to say someone else wouldn't like it. It was a little junior highish for me. Long on silly not so much on funny.,1304899200,,225,4.022222222222222
8066345,5,B0009SUS9G,A very skilled ventriloquist and appropriate for all ages.  I was very pleased with this purchase.,1245715200,,98,5.125
8066346,5,B0009SUS9G,"What a funny guy Taylor is!
We all laughed until we were crying.  Our 11 yr old daughter couldn't even catch her breath during the last act on stage with audience participation.  Clean jokes - delivery was hysterical and we find ourselves mimicking him now around the house. 5 year old wasn't interested at all and she loves Mr. Bean - so I would say ages 8 and up would get enjoyment out of this show.  We plan on using it for youth group activites at church.... the kids will love it!",1202774400,,486,4.260869565217392
8066347,5,B0009SUS9G,"Happy that there's some clean comedy out there.  Mason has his own little variety show.  He does some comedy by himself, then he gets out some unique puppets for some ventriloquism, gets the audience involved, and even plays a little keyboard.  DVD has some behind the scenes stuff also, like Mason & the Bananas host visiting local radio stations to promote the live show.  Entertaining throughout!  And Taylor Mason is a very funny man!",1201478400,,438,4.864864864864865
