225332,5,6300212912,"This min-series is excellent, and by far one of the most original stories made into film.  The cast is ideal for their respective roles, and the scenery of the moors is stunning.  So it would obviously be worthwhile to create it on DVD.  Hopefully the video producers will realize this soon, as more people want DVD format the the fading-away-into-oblivion VHS.",1125273600,7,361,4.885245901639344
225333,5,6300212912,"This is far better than Hitchcock's version of ""Jamaica Inn"". Jane Seymour never looked more beautiful than in this compelling, beautifully filmed mini-series. The cast is great, the scenery breathtaking (just like Seymour!), & the combination of suspense & romance make this a winner! I don't know why it's not on dvd yet, but until then I suggest you buy this on vhs. It's that good! Just make sure you get the full version & not the single-tape version which is bad quality (EP).",1098316800,17,482,4.75
225334,4,6300212912,"In this mini-series adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's novel ""Jamaica Inn"", Jane Seymour stars as the confused yet ethical Mary Yellan, a young woman who finds herself confronting some unknown evil on the Cornish moors.

I will not critique Du Maurier's story--it is a great Gothic masterpiece which employs tone, description, plot and characterization to near perfection---read the book to enjoy Du Maurier's talent and imagination at its best.

This adaptation follows the novel much more closely than Hitchcock's earlier film. However, some twists were added to further dramatize an already tumultuous story. I must wonder why this was necessary and can only think, sadly, that the original story was thought too tame in the light of our 20th/21st century viewpoints of violence. In this version, Mary's parents are victims to the sinister plot that wraps Jamaica Inn in secret, making Mary's involvement all the more desperate and poignant. If one has read the book before viewing the film, this addition seems overdone, detracting from the original and eliminating the self-righteously ethical factor so important to Mary's character. In order to emphasize the romance in the plot, Mary's relationship with the landlord's brother tallys up more screen time when compared percentage-wise with the novel's presentation of the same interplay---there are actually more scenes in the book where the characters are together, yet the book allows you to speculate as it plays the romance off the tale of suspense and the film does not. Patrick McGoohan plays Joss with a little too much gruffness--we never really see the vulnerability and helplessness which lie beneath the surface and appear after he has soaked himself in rum. There are never any scenes with both Jem and Joss together---the necessary comparison made between the brothers is not allowed and hence, we do not quite see Mary's dilemma in her attraction to Jem or what might have attracted her Aunt in the past. Aunt Patience, played by Billy Whitelaw, would have been perfect as the once beautiful woman worn down by the knowledge of her husband's misdeeds. However,through her stern cautionary conversations with Mary, she appears too logically complacent, more a fully functioning partner to Joss rather than the frightened remains of the silly woman whose head was turned by him in the first place. Jane Seymour's portrayal of Mary includes the bit of pep that DuMaurier states but never fully demonstrates, yet she tends to be too saucy at times, playing the active willing foil to Jem's criminal antics rather than the shocked observer from the pages of the novel.

The film is most definitely capitalizing on Du Maurier's so-called reputation for escapist romance; yet the book is not a romance at all, but rather Du Maurier's grim testament to the status of women as dependent creatures, shoved here and there by their stronger male counterparts.  Mary doesn't necessarily find love nor does love conquer adversity as we are meant to conclude from this presentation. There is no moral lesson scorching Du Maurier's pages.  Du Maurier's vision was much more dismal---Mary, finally beaten,accepts her fate and plays second fiddle to Jem's maleness; she learns to acquiesce to her dependency. Despite these fundemental differences, the film as a romantic interlude, is still good; it fully depicts Du Maurier's Cornwall seeped in its weather and crowned by monoliths. The film's music tends to be a little melodramatic--it is of the Camille Claudel genre--I think an insiduous pan pipe along the Braveheart vein would have been a better contrast with the rain, gloom and terror than 'Transfigured Night' which doles out more of the same.",1045267200,37,3705,5.188963210702341
225335,5,6300212912,"I have watched this video at least 10 times and am impressed each time with the intensity that is ever present in this dark and terrifying story. Yet within we have a romance between the impossibly young Jane Seymour and Trevor Eve, who are both cute as can be and still thoroughly reflect the grimness and tragedy of the tale. Twists and turns take you places wholely unexpected and keep you glued even to the rather capriciously happy ending!",1005436800,7,444,4.632911392405063
225336,5,6300212912,"Jamaica Inn is one of my favorite books. I have not seen the older version of the movie but I think this one is terrific. It follows the book very well and is a visual treat. It has everything, action, romance and intrigue. Jane Seymour, Patrick McGoohan, Trevor Eve and John McEnery were wonderful in their parts and the music was hauntingly beautiful. I have since learned from another reviewer that the music is "" Transfigured Night"" by Arnold Schoenberg. I think it's a shame that it's been allowed to go out of print and hope it will be released again, hopefully in both formats.",973296000,9,584,4.571428571428571
225337,2,6300212912,"I love Jane, but I have to say that this video is not worth adding to your library.  It is too drawn out and too difficult to follow.  Sometimes seeming pointless.  Sorry, Jane, but you've done better.  I would recommend  Somewhere in Time or Scarlet Pimpernel for those desiring to see Jane in  pictures.",921110400,2,305,4.555555555555555

225395,1,6300212912,"I ordered the VHS for ""Jamaica Inn"" and the tape was supposed to be in good shape, but it was not.  We are barely able to watch it.  The sound is completely distorted and the picture quality is very poor.  This movie should have been worth about $1.00 and I will trash it.",1354665600,,272,4.09433962264151
225396,5,6300212912,This version of Jamaica in was by far the best out of the two and I can't understand why Alfred Hitchcock's version was put on dvd but not this version.  Videotape machines are becoming scarcer nowadays and soon certain films will be lost.  This film should be rereleased on dvd.  I will be the first to purchase it if it is.,1292630400,2,325,4.295081967213115
225397,2,6300212912,"This was a very dark movie/miniseries.  So dark that it was difficult to see the faces sometimes. It was supposed to be gothic and scary, but it wasn't. Jane Seymour plays Mary Yellen who has gone to live with her only relative, an aunt who co-owns Jamaica Inn.  The aunt is very mistreated by her husband, who tries to boss Mary around.  Mary, however, sticks up for herself.  There is a rather interesting vicar who tells Mary that he is her friend and she can trust him.  I know when somebody tells you that, you better watch out. Mary is still a bit naive, though.

Mary attempts to unravel the ""mystery"" of the Inn and her uncle, but anyone can plainly see what's going on, even though it is dark.  All of the actors were excellent, although Jane Seymour's eyeliner, mascara and shimmery eyeshadow did not belong in this time period.  The ending was also extremely dumb.",1267401600,,875,4.528662420382165
7805065,4,6300212912,"I just finished the book and started to watch  the BBC version. Ugh! Horrible. They ruined the characters with their creative license. This version follows the book and its a classic for a reason so I appreciate that. The characters were as Id imagined esp Uncle Joss. Jane Seymour was relatively good and Aunt Patience was gaunt, fearful, and borderline crazy as youd expect.  I was very pleased with this version.",1518739200,,415,4.830985915492958
7805066,3,6300212912,"The 1939 version of the same name, with Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara is a far better film, which moves along at a much quicker pace, with a lot more happening. This 1983 version with Jane Seymour is okay. I watched this film over several days, because it is too long at 3-hours and too slow to watch at one sitting. The bad-guys do things differently in this version, which adds some interest. Filmed on location in Cornwall England, where the story is set. Cornwall is a coastal, jutting peninsula, southwest of London, which has a rocky, meandering, jagged, coastline hazardous to ships trying to sail around this horn from one coastal city to another; from say, Liverpool to London. The land of Cornwall is the moors, flat and rolling rocky land, which is overcast and windswept with winds from the sea; a harsh, dreary, desolate, area. I do not regret watching this film. I am just disappointed, because the film has moments of excellence, and could have been better; could have been that way all the way through; at a better pace. This is a 1-hour film; stretched to 3-hours, but it holds your attention. The threats and murders are more real; more brutal in this version; and thus, the threat to Jane Seymour's safety.",1518393600,,1231,4.703703703703703
7805067,5,6300212912,I've never watched. I bought it as a gift for my grandfather. One of his favourite films and it was great to still get it on VHS. He gives it 5 stars.,1494720000,,150,3.71875

7805073,5,6300212912,"This 1983 HTV West (ITV) version is far superior to the BBC's 2014 effort where the actors mumbled their way through a distortion of du Maurier's story.  Even though I'm not a fan, Jane Seymour does a good job; of course,  Patrick McGoohan and Trevor Eve are superb.  This ITV production lives up to all one expects from a British costume drama.",1434153600,,345,4.532258064516129
