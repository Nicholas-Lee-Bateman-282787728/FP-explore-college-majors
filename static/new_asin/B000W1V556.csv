8220997,5,B000W1V556,"As always, Shaw Brothers dvd's are beautiful, remastered, widescreen transfers, and they always are intelligent enough to include English subtitles to ensure much higher sales.  At one point the entire Shaw library was remastered and re released so a new generation could enjoy such wonderful films.  However beware of bootlegs of Shaw dvds.  Because they are rare titles, and imported from China, some sellers are hawking pirated copies.  The one i received was unfortunately a bootleg.  They are difficult to spot, because they feature the same full color artwork both on the case and the disc.  Look on the flipside of the disc. If it's original it will be silver, if it's a bootleg/burned dvd it will be blue.  Also the original disc will not play in a region-locked player, while the region code on a bootleg has been removed.  The picture quality will be the same, as the copy is a port of the original dvd.  The problem with bootlegs is that they have no cash value. In case you want to sell it someday, you will have a problem.  Also, selling bootlegs is illegal. i don't even recall the seller's name so i can't mention it here.  Even though i got a beautiful print of a great, rare film, i still feel ripped off. so when buying Asian imports of Shaw titles, be careful that you have gotten a legitimate product..",1344729600,2,1322,4.630901287553648
