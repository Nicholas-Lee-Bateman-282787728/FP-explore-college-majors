4903220,4,B005XGJW50,"Michael, Johnny and Ted are three typical aging gay Weho party boys, who decide to check out New York, making the drive cross country, with lots of stops to check out the :""action"" along the way.  The last night before NYC, they stop in a small town, where Johnny talks them into going to a local country bar, where he is to meet someone he contacted via a gay hookup phone app.  ""The Lion's Den"" looks like your typical redneck bar, but running into homophobes is the least of their problems.  They are being watched, and plans are being made.

This is a extremely violent, sexually-explicit horror film, kind of a gay version of ""Hostel.""  This type of film is not my usual cup of tea, but I have to admit they did it remarkably well for a small budget indie.  The characters are well defined, played by actors who are convincing in their roles, and the special effects and musical score compliment the suspenseful time to come.  Except for a few minor inconsistencies, I really can't fault this on anything, subject matter aside.  I give it four stars out of five.",1325203200,17,1067,4.520833333333333

4903222,3,B005XGJW50,"This was more of a comedy than a horror really because, unless you're a poor little latin boy in drag, you're not likely to find many gays indulging in Transcontinental road trips. In a car. Stopping at motels without frequency programs and concierge floors. And, suspension of disbelief will only take you so far and, it most certainly will never take you to that bar. This would have been amazing had they really gone for a shameless gay remake of Hostel. Even so, for everything it wasn't, it was enjoyable with some strong moments, a few good lines and a fair amount of camp humor. But, this is one you can easily watch whilst putting your curlers in at night.",1430611200,3,664,4.541666666666667
4903223,3,B005XGJW50,Road trip movie with 3 good looking guys from LA..  Sexual games get carried away in a violent way. Wel done story of what can happen in a small town bar.,1415836800,,154,3.967741935483871
4903224,3,B005XGJW50,"It is almost impossible to rate this.  At one point I thought this is offensive and not politically correct.  Then I laughed.  Then I thought gay people have as much right to make fun of themselves as anyone else.  It is campy.  I loved some of the banter. The horror part is kind of dumb. The movie is a worth a watch. My reactions were almost as interesting to me as the movie itself.  I get the impression that this is the beginning of something.  As a B horror picture fan,I applaud the attempts to add fresh ideas to the genre.",1411862400,,532,4.207920792079208

4903226,1,B005XGJW50,"Low Budget film, but agree that the acting is horrid!  Jodie Shultz's performance shows such amateurish skill that the story is lost for poor performance.
Save your money!  view a classic with more integrity!",1410912000,2,208,5.088235294117647
4903227,1,B005XGJW50,"What a waste of time this movie is/was.  A reviewer said it was like Hostel and I am wanting to know where and what part because that is an insult to Eli Roth.  Three gay men are headed to New York and decide to stop in a one horse town because one of the men has been talking to a local on grindr and wants to go to the local watering hole called ""The Lions den"" in hopes of getting lucky.  From what happens there just gets worse... The acting is terrible, the stereotypes here are really bad from the gay men to the backwoods bar owners, to the plot I mean really just a piece of garbage this film was.  It was not funny, nor hot and the trailer was so misleading and made this movie look good and the poster too man what a trick that was.
Seriously folks save your money and skip this train wreck of a movie!",1410220800,3,812,3.993827160493827
4903228,3,B005XGJW50,"That was one of the funniest movies I watched in a long time.  It was like a train wreck; you have to keep watching.  The acting was terrible, the story was thin and the characters were poorly developed.  A similar movie would not have earned even half a star.  It was really that bad.

BUT

A gay horror flick!  Ingenious!  It started out completely plausible.  It even played to some fantasies usually reserved for movies that you can't get on Amazon (and the acting was just as bad).  That's where it got funny.  I couldn't stop laughing as the boys tried to escape their situation.  Oh my lord - it was a scene right out of a bad 60s 'B' movie.  5 stars for camp!

Seriously, if you want to watch a good gay themed flick with hot male actors, pass this one up.  But if you have an hour and a half to kill and a few dollars left on that amazon gift card (and you've watched every other movie in the library) give this one a try.  Just keep a sense of humor about you.",1405382400,3,970,4.106951871657754

4903230,4,B005XGJW50,"This film is not going to win any awards but it wasn't bad.  I've certainly watched a lot worse.  Probably the main reason to watch it is Ronnie Kroell eye candy.  It may make you think twice about using a hook-up app, though.",1402444800,4,226,4.209302325581396

4903232,3,B005XGJW50,Movie had a good story line and a lot of possibility.  The acting was not that good and must have been a low budget movie.  It was just ok for me.,1401148800,,146,3.6774193548387095

4903237,3,B005XGJW50,the first 30 minutes is not heavy in great showmanship but after 30 to 46 minutes the movie really holds a punch in the fact that the acting gets better and the story line is so good you will remember this story line and movie a long time take out the nude parts and the rape with hiv and a better movie is made,1394496000,,311,3.875
4903238,4,B005XGJW50,this movie is good for the plot not bad when you have nothing else to watch but this what has become of gay movies bad acting and not much of anything else,1389744000,,155,3.875

4903242,2,B005XGJW50,"The acting and story line were not bad but the script needed a bit of work.
Plus the film needed more script, too much film with no words.
Probably a good hour, maybe 70 minutes.
If you are going any longer you need more story lines to make the road trip interesting.
Good cross-section of characters but not strong enough to carry the film.",1364601600,,341,4.34375
4903243,2,B005XGJW50,This movie was okay...but it could have been a much better movie...if the actors had been more professional.  The cast tries thier best to make the scenes work....but they just weren't convincing enough.  The plot is about 3 gay men who set out to have a great time...only to land up at a straight bar where unexepected situations occur. The story is a sad one...not the kind of movie I would recommend to anyone.,1362614400,,413,4.5675675675675675
4903244,3,B005XGJW50,"This is the story of three gay friends from West Hollywood who having grown bored with all that sun shine and happy laid back people have decided to take a road trip to the Big Apple. Along the way they want to get a flavour of the country they are passing through.  The 38 years old guy of the bunch is Johnny (Jesse Archer - `Going Down in La La Land') has a mobile positioning device that lets him know where all available action is en route and so wants to get a bit more `flavour' than most.

Anyway they end up in Nowherseville at a crummy motel but Johnny wants to go to a low rent dive called `The Lion's Den', (now you get the title)it's the sort of place where dust goes to die and the in house singer - `The Mouth of the South',  should be on that X Factor show, just to be humiliated with her truly appalling vocals - and she was dubbed!

Anyway there are a few scuffles and Michael ( played rather well by Ronnie Kroell - `Eating Out Drama Camp') and Ted decide to leave, but alone at the bar things don't go so nicely for Johnny as he finally gets a bit of `flavour' but it was far from what he wanted to sample. What happens next is the inevitable `horror'. Actually the themes are horrible but in many aspects it is far from being horrific. It is comedic in places, some issues are dealt with but it is all a bit predictable, no one will be gasping at a sudden plot shift and the production values are a bit - `oh dear' at times too. The acting varies in quality as does the sound and I am not going to bother with ropey lighting as I have seen far worse, but is still inexcusable. And there are some plot holes or moreover people doing stupid things that will always end in disaster type scenarios, which I find yawn worthy at best.

All that said I still watched the full 82 minutes and felt it was an OK film and a reasonable way to pass the time but not one for a second viewing at all, as I said there are a lot worse films out there but like wise this could have been a fair bit better.",1359244800,4,2008,4.047858942065491

4903246,5,B005XGJW50,this movie i like and hated.  road trip are starting to get scary if you don't watch what you say or do especially being gay.,1355702400,,125,4.0
4903247,1,B005XGJW50,"The fact that I bought this movie based on the average 4 star rating here on Amazon proves that there is a sucker born every minute. Please, for the love of all that's holy, do NOT waste almost $13 like I did! Rent if you have to see what it's all about but DO NOT BUY! All-together, this movie is worth about 50 cents.

The story so far: Three VERY GAY guys (fa-laming!) go on a cross-country quest to find a) some action, b) how to be a ""man"" (which is hilarious because the actor is basically a girl with testicles), and c) how to get over being infected by an HIV positive lover. All of this is explained ad nauseum to the viewer by the actors who have to sit and have a nice little gay talk about it... Boooring!

One of the very first scenes is a show-everyone-my-huge-thing-because-that's-my-only-redeeming-quality-because-I-can't-act b**w-job inside a ""dirty"" pitstop bathroom stall. I almost turned it off at that point, realizing that I had basically been duped into thinking this thing had a story and instead had bought some fluffy, poorly acted porno. Later on in the story the ""slut"" of the group (same one that gave the b-j) hooks up with a very butch looking bartender in a very fake, very low-budget ""bar"" out in the middle of Pennsylvania.

I turned it off after that. Ostensibly I believe the storyline is supposed to devolve into some kind of slasher film but I didn't bother to find out. This movie will be going to the nearest trashcan as soon as possible. I'm sure all the 4 star ratings were given by either a) the visually impaired, b) someone who has never seen a movie before, or c) friends of the actors.

No substance, no story, nothing properly called acting.",1350000000,7,1689,4.546052631578948

4903249,4,B005XGJW50,"It's tough to find gay horror movies that merit more than one viewing, but this is one of those rare instances where I was caught off guard. Into the Lion's Den is a bit like Hostel (as others have pointed out), but it has three leads with great rapport who help us through the weak spots. The torture scenes are tough, but do give the film a needed weight. The budget is obviously low, the acting spotty and i wish the producers had cast at least one actor among the three leads who was not a stereotype. But those are small complaints. There are some genuinely tense moments and it kept me guessing until the end.",1326844800,15,615,4.310344827586207
4903250,5,B005XGJW50,"Into The Lion's Den is a gay-themed thriller, in the vein of Hostel. Only it's far less gruesome, and far more interesting. It's a well-acted, fast paced ride that runs 74 minutes, and I never checked the time or got bored. That hardly ever happens.

The blu-ray is cut. Censored. I emailed to find out why. The movie company said that the blu-ray company thought the scenes were to graphic. So they cut them out of blu-ray. So how would you allow someone else to censor your work, project, film whatever. That is mind boggling. You pay someone to do a job for you and they take it upon themselves to change what ever they want. Do NOT buy this. If you want the original movie. Buy the DVD.",1521417600,,599,4.2631578947368425
