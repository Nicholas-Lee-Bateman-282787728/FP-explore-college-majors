2691586,3,B000KHX72G,"I've been saying ever since No Mercy 2004 that SmackDown has been on a streak of good PPV's but unfortunately I had to say that came to an end here for a disappointing No Way Out...and I was there live.  The show wasn't bad but there was more bad than good for this show.

Hardy Boyz & Chris Benoit vs. MNM & MVP - First of all, WWE had originally advertised a rematch from the Armageddon Ladder Match but then it was cancelled at the last minute & we ended up getting this match...plus is was just weird to see Benoit in a opening filler match.  Putting that aside, the match itself was good for an opener as everyone worked really hard.

Crusierweight Open: Crusierweight Champion Gregory Helms vs. Funaki vs. Jamie Noble vs. Daivari vs. Shannon Moore vs. Jimmy Wang Yang vs. Chavo Guerrero - The match itself was decent but with this ""gauntlet"" format, nobody really has much time to show off what they can do.  With that in mind, the match was decent but really disappointing for two reasons.  One was the end of the Gregory Helms record setting title reign without a real storyline to it.  And the second was that Chavo Guerrero came out as ""a surprise entrant"" but his picture was on the WWE.com website advertising the match so the surprise came off really flat & him winning the title was predictable.

Boogeyman & Little Boogeyman vs. Finlay & Little Bastard - This was just more of a comedy match than anything else but it got real dry at parts (ala whenever they went for their worms) and the ending made me laugh.  Besides that, you'll either laugh or hate this one.

Kane vs. King Booker - Better match than I expected as Booker was able to give his first outstanding performance since those horrible series of matches with Batista and Kane has really revived his career since his move to SmackDown as this match will show.  Plus the ending was a shocker since it ended cleanly.

WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. Deuce N' Domino - This is the second time that London & Kendrick have faced a rookie tag team just thrown together to give them something to do but unlike James & Stevens at No Mercy, the ""Grease"" rejects were just too green and it showed heavily in this match as I was really bored...which I'm normally not during a London & Kendrick match.  This match looks even worse when you think that WWE cancelled the tag team Ladder Match in favor of this match.  The only outstanding moment here was how the ending came together.

ECW Champion Lashley vs. Mr. Kennedy - I have to mention to check out the great heel promo Kennedy cut before this match. Unfortunately, Lashley didn't have an opponent like Test who makes him look better in comparison or someone like Finlay who can carry him to a good match.  Kennedy did his best by telling a story in the ring & constantly working on the legs throughout the whole match but Lashley just was on the defense for most of the match.  Eventhough the DQ finish happened & Lashley ended up beating the hell out of Kennedy...it didn't save face, as this was just a bad match for Lashley.

Diva Talent Invitational - Who would have ever thought the Miz was actually the best part of a diva segment?  The ECW strippers did their ""dance"" with Kelly Kelly being off key as usual followed by Jillian attempting her William Hung impersonation before insulting all the divas who then came out for a catfight.  Then Ashley came out & took off her top to show Playboy bunny pastries over her boobs while he Playboy cover was in the background.  This was just to promote Ashley in Playboy magazine but overall, this was just even more stupid & dumb than a normal diva segment is.

Batista & Undertaker vs. John Cena & Shawn Michaels - We all know that we can depend on Undertaker & HBK to give us a match of the night while Cena & Batista have bad reputations for being champions ""who can't wrestle.""  However, I'll go on record as to say that Cena upstaged Batista because Batista did his normal moves & normal effort he's shown since coming back from his injury while Cena stepped his game up by doing such moves as a legdrop for the top rope & his old ""throwback.""  And the ending was just perfect to continue both storylines leading into the WrestleMania main events.  This was better than last years ""Main Event vs. Main Event"" match on Saturday Night's Main Event.

Usually on the SmackDown PPV's...there's around 1-2 matches or segments to skip & enjoy the rest of the show but here, half the show was average to good while the rest was just bad.  I recommend this for a rental & judge for yourself.",1172620800,11,4581,4.474759615384615
2691587,3,B000KHX72G,"WWE's No Way out 2007 was just another average pay per view. There were one or two good matches and a couple poor matches. Let's take a look at the matches:

The Hardy Boyz and Chris Benoit versus MNM and Montel Vontavius Porter:

This was a great way to kick off the show. These guys were given about fifteen minutes and they put a lot of effort into the match and it really shows. Although MVP looked a little out of place here, everyone else worked really well together. It's a shame that they have no storyline for Chris Benoit, but at least they found a way to work him into the pay per view.

Cruiserweight Open:

This was a decent match, but, as usual, the cruiserweights were not given a fair amount of time to show what they can do. The surprise entrant at the end of the match was a little predictable, but it was nice to see that the defending champion was not even involved in the conclusion of the match. The cruiserweight division has been stagnant for some time. But WWE needs to offer an alternative to TNA's X-Division, so the cruiserweights should be given more match time in the future. This match was a good way to start that off.

Finlay and Little Bastard versus the Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman:

There isn't a whole lot to say about this match as it was, really, more of a comedy than an actual match. There was a decent about of humor, and a little wrestling, but nothing outstanding in either regard.

King Booker versus Kane:

This was a really good match. Both Kane and Booker can wrestle and they were given enough time to put on a solid show. The match benefited also from a clean ending, which is so often absent from King Booker's matches. Kane has looked really good since moving over to Smackdown! and this match is no exception.

Paul London and Brian Kendrick (C) versus Deuce N' Domino:

It's a shame that there really is no tag team division to speak of. London and Kendrick are both capable of putting on very good matches. Although Deuce and Domino are not terrible wrestlers, they really could not keep up with London and Kendrick. Because of that, neither of the tag champions were not really able to show off, and this match did not amount to much of anything.

Bobby Lashley (C) versus Mr. Kennedy:

Although this match was better than expected, it was not a very good match. It was a typical Lashley match, so if you enjoy his work, you'll like this one. Mr. Kennedy did his best here, and made Lashley look acceptable, but this match really is not worth watching.

Diva Talent Invitational:

Another opportunity to squeeze the ladies in there. If you like the typical diva segment, than this will work for you. But it is nothing special or unique.

Batista and the Undertaker versus John Cena and Shawn Michaels:

This was easily one of the top two matches of the night. The buildup for this match has been wonderful, and it fits in perfectly with the overall buildup towards Wrestlemania. Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker carried this match and, as a result, both Batista and John Cena looked pretty good out there. Definitely worth a watch.

I cannot recommend that you buy this event. Like most WWE pay per views, there are one or two good matches and the rest of the matches are poor. As far as WWE events go, this was not bad, so if you typically buy the WWE dvds, you will not be disappointed. But if you generally do not buy the events, No Way Out 2007 is not for you.",1171843200,9,3424,4.444089456869009

8157054,2,B000KHX72G,"I'm gonna make this short, because quite frankly, there isn't much to say.  So, here we go:

The main event features the ""RAW"" WrestleMania main event teaming against the ""SmackDown"" WrestleMania main event.  I like to call this an ""all-star match"", meaning that even though nothing is at stake, the match is an excellent showcase for four superstars to put on a great match.  Shawn Michaels and John Cena (""RAW"") competed against Undertaker and Batista (""SmackDown"") in one of the year's best matches.  The combinations are fascinating, like seeing Undertaker and Shawn Michaels square off after almost 10 years since their last official match (Royal Rumbles aside).  I wasn't a big fan of Batista back in 2007, but he really started to shine when working with Taker.  John Cena has always been hit-or-miss with me, but he was on a streak of good matches at this point, which shows in this tag team contest.  This is just such a good 2-on-2 bout that I almost recommend the DVD...

...But that's where it stops!

There are several other tag team matches on the card, only one of them any good.  The opener pits MNM and M.V.P. against Chris Benoit and The Hardys.  While not as great as it looks, it's still a solid way to get a show going, with all six guys getting their chance to work for a good length of time.

No Way Out 2007 also features Finlay & Little Bastard (aka Hornswoggle) against The Boogeyman and Little Boogey.  Finlay is awesome, the midgets are amusing, and Boogeyman sucks.  Sorry, but Boogeyman never worked a decent match in his entire WWE career, with most of them being squashes and/or flatout boring.  Amusing, but forgettable.

The other tag match on the card includes Paul London & Brian Kendrick defending their WWE Tag Team Titles against Deuce 'N Domino.  Why the champions were forced to continue their exciting title reign against these rookies, I have no idea.  Even more criminal is that after this shockingly dull affair, Kendrick & London soon lost the belts to these greasers.  I will forever call this match the demise of WWE's current tag team division.

The ECW Title match between Bobby Lashley and ""SmackDown""'s Mr. Kennedy is boring, even though Kennedy was picking up some momentum in his career.  Lashley's powerhouse-technical style just doesn't mesh with Kennedy's unorthodox style.  And why is the ECW champion facing a ""SmackDown"" competitor, anyway?  ECW was a terrible brand back in 2007, and WWE must've desperate to pump some life into this card.

Another surprising letdown is a gauntlet for the Cruiserweight Title.  What this means is that two wrestlers will compete in a one-on-one match, and then after someone loses, a new wrestler will take the loser's place.  Whoever is left standing after 9 wrestlers wins the belt.  Now, cruiserweights imply light-heavyweight action, which usually means an exciting time.  But not here.  In a very stupid move that didn't pay off, Gregory Helms was booked to end his 9-month (I think) title reign in the MIDDLE of the match!  But rather than going with the increasingly popular Jimmy Wang Yang, the WWE decided to have Chavo Guerrero hold the belt AGAIN!  I like Chavo a lot, but as famous booker Gary Hart once said, ""Fans don't want to be outsmarted, they want to be entertained.""  I can only enjoy having the rug pulled from underneat so many times before I feel cheated; this Cruiserweight Title Invitational was a cheat.

Do I even need to mention the Diva Talent Contest, or whatever it was called?  Let's just move on.

The last match I want to cover is a grudge match between King Booker and Kane.  While not anything great, it's actually a solid showing from both men.  I think Kane's move to ""SmackDown"" at the time was a great move for him, and King Booker's feuds with Batista and Bobby Lashley in 2006 were pretty poor (in my opinion).  Booker needed a fresh start, and I think this was a place to start.  Sadly, King Booker's last great match was a few weeks after this PPV (against Matt Hardy on ""SmackDown"" on the 03/09/07 show), while the rest of his WWE career was forgettable.

No Way Out 2007 is a bad PPV, plain and simple.  You get a solid opening 6-Man Tag Team match, a solid Kane/Booker grudge match in the middle to keep you awake, and a pointless-yet-excellent interpromotional Tag Team Match as your main event.  Two titles were retained in boring fashion, while a third title changed hands in a sad way (a wrestler I liked won, yet I was very upset).  No Way Out 2007 was the last brand-exclusive PPV from the WWE.  After WrestleMania 23, April's Backlash was no longer a ""RAW"" event.

Look up the main event on YouTube, and Kane's 3-disc set from the WWE includes the King Booker contest from this event.  As a good hymn tells us, ""All other ground is sinking sand.""",1179100800,2,4795,4.701080432172869
