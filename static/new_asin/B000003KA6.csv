7903054,5,B000003KA6,"Be informed, I give away the ending in this review.  I'll try to not replow too much old ground about the show's plot, but essentially it is that one of the Q continuum, a self-described ""philosopher Q,"" has done, seen, thought, and said it all (as has the rest of the Q community)and wishes to end what has become a dreary, painfully tedious existence.

This renegade Q seeks asylum aboard Voyager convincing Captain Janeway to decide whether to grant his wish, with Tuvok as his advocate and the original Q (John de Lancie)as his court room foe.  What ensues is both hilarious and thought-provoking.  The right to suicide is debated, as is the right of the state to force itself upon one of its members.  And behind all this is the backdrop that leads to this spaceship asylum hearing: if you had eternal life would you eventually get sick of it? If you did, is there anything you could do about it? Infinite existence is a long, long time.

The courtroom arguments go back and forth, the Q arguing that the rogue's suicide would have unforeseeable effects on the Q community and the universe in general, while the rogue Q argues an individual right to choose and the horror of both his existence and his punishment if he loses this case.  The deciding moment comes when all involved are taken to the Q continuum itself, modified to make sense for us poor mortals.  The rogue points out the complete ennui, bleak boredom and triviality of the other Qs' lives.  He finally makes an impact on Q, though you won't know this until the show's end.

Janeway is torn between the two sides and the various arguments and reluctantly decides that the rogue Q is suffering enough to justify suicide.  He is made mortal and invited to join the ship's crew, but he commits suicide with some kind of space-age hemlock Q (de Lancie) provides him.  Shades of Socrates' trial and death!  The rogue calls his death his last gift to the Q while his opponent Q begins to see that the dying man had a point or two.

The show is intelligent and well-written and covers some intriguing points, while mixing humor in as well.  Not only are suicide, its justifications, and the rights of the individual touched on, but also this point: if you've finally experienced all there is to experience, and all that's left is infinite repetition, is immortality a boon or a curse?",1101254400,,2348,4.610576923076923
7903055,5,B000003KA6,"Just knowing that Q (John de Lancie) makes his way to the Delta Quadrant is going to be enough to sell most of you on watching ""Star Trek: Voyager"" Episode 30, ""Death Wish"" (Story by Shawn Piller, Teleplay by Michael Piller, Aired February 19, 1996), but this is also a solid episode that actually explores the life of the Q.  ""Voyager"" accidentally beams board a member of the Q Continuum (Gerrit Graham) who was imprisoned inside a comet.  The grateful Q (okay, really Q2) tries to go on his merry way, but all of the male members of the ""Voyager"" crew disappear instead of him.  Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) wants her crew back, but instead the ""original"" Q arrives to ""help.""  He tells Janeway that Q2 had been imprisoned in the comet for 300 years because of repeated attempts to commit suicide.  Q2's demands asylum and then proceeds to hurtle the starship around the universe in an attempt to lose Q.  Janeway ends the fun by agreeing to hold a hearing to consider Q2's request.  Because of her decision either Q2 will be returned to his prison or will become mortal so that he can end his existence.
Tuvok (Tim Russ) represents Q2 at the hearing while Q makes the case for the continuum.  Q2 is bored with being immortal and Q is worried about what happens when immortal beings shed their immortality.  Witnesses who have been affected by the Q are called, including one very familiar bearded face.  Of course, Q tries to persuade Janeway to see things his way by telling her he will send ""Voyager"" home if she rules in his favor.  But you know Captain Janeway and her overly developed sense of justice.  The ending is not without it twists and in terms of Q episodes across the ""Star Trek"" universe ""Death Wish"" is certainly different, and not just because Q takes has a different reaction to Janeway than he did to Picard or Sisko.  This is an excellent episode that introduces the ""Voyager"" crew to the joys of Q without getting the series off track.",1059264000,2,1963,4.574285714285714
7903056,5,B000003KA6,"Okay...I absolutely loved this episode and consider it to be one of the high points of Voyager Season 2 - and this is saying alot because I'm not usually a big fan of the Q episodes, in any of the Star Trek series.
The reason I enjoyed this episode so much is because it made me think.  What *would* it be like to be immortal?  Would existence become boring once I'd seen everything and done everything there was to do?  Interesting questions to ponder, especially for a person who believes in the after-life!
Additionally, in this episode I found the character of Q to be quick-witted and interesting rather than just immature and annoying...which is how I have historically felt about Q episodes.  John DeLuncie does a good job here, as does the actor who plays the ""other"" Q (Quinn).
Plus, as an added bonus for all you Riker fans...Will makes an appearance in this episode.  Sorta nice to see him after all these years!
All in all, a ""must see"" for Voyager Season 2.",996019200,5,970,4.52
7903057,5,B000003KA6,"This is the first episode of Star Trek: Voyager with the omnipotent Q in it and one of two episodes with Q in it. The other episode is ""The Q And The Grey"", Episode 53. In this episode, another Q, called Q2 according to startrek.com, wants to die. He wants to commit suicide because, according to him, after living for hundreds or thousands of years, you've done everything and seen everything. There is nothing left to see and do. Everything is the same, day in and day out, and the Q's should have the right to die. As you may or may not know, the Q's are immortal; they never die. And, according to Q2, immortality becomes a disease that inflicts his people. As a result, Q shows up to stop him from doing something rash. Q wants him to be like the rest of the Q's: happy and free living with immortality. But Q2 doesn't listen to him and wants to put an end to his dredgeful existence. This is all being said aboard Voyager. So, Capt. Janeway, attempting to save her ship from this tug of war, plays the role of judge, jury, and, unbeknownst to her, executioner, and has a hearing on Voyager on Q2's behalf. Q has changed since he was tormenting the crew of the Enterprise and this episode links his doings now and all of those in his past with the Enterprise. Superb episode of Q with Star Trek: Voyager.",985824000,7,1309,4.32520325203252
7903058,5,B000003KA6,"This episode is awesome. Q is back. (The strange...annoying,pestering,bugging immortal being)A Q appears on Voyager after being released from prison which is in a comet. He says he wants to be mortal and die. Captain Janeway then gets stuck in the middle of a fight between Q (John De Lance) and another Q who wants to die. After the argument, the Q that wants to be mortal begs for assylum from Captain Janeway which then leads to a trial with some good and yet funny surprises in it....OH, Guess who visits? It's one of the best.",982454400,3,531,4.541666666666667
7903059,5,B000003KA6,"Riddled with Q humor, this episode strikes the heart of a Star Trekie.  However, this episode (like others) has some serious messages dealing with  the issues of mercy killing and assisted suicide.  Honestly, I loved this  episode for the Socrates/Plato allusion.  I show the episode to my advanced  10th grade English class when we study Plato's Apology.  That's how I like  it: Intelligent TV!",964310400,4,395,5.0625
7903060,4,B000003KA6,"Voyager beams aboard a Q who wants to die. The Q Star Trek fans know well (John De Lancie) also comes aboard and shows interest in Captain Janeway. Q also brings aboard certain figures he claims to have an impact on,  including the Riker family. This is a good episode because it has a guest  appearance by Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. Riker from ST:TNG), and the viewers  see what the Q Continuum is actually like.",961977600,6,409,4.5
