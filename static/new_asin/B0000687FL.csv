1725151,4,B0000687FL,"This offering reminds me so much of ""A Few Good Men"".  The movie started by laying out the groundwork, of soldiers from both North & South Korea died in a conflict.  It's up to a neutral party, which is unbiased towards North & South Korea to be involved in the investigation.  The investigator was in the form of this beautiful & intelligent officer.  She claimed to be in the military and from Switzerland.  Yet, her slim physique told me otherwise & at times, it was bleeming difficult to understand her English & one could only imagine how many times she would need to rehearse to read her lines properly.  Anyhow, the question about who did it & why were what made this movie so interesting.  In the end, the twisting end would definitely caught you by surprise.  Along the way, we were given a succinct but concise explanation about the origin of DMZ and the reason why Koreans from 1950's Korean War were scattered throughout the world.  Then, the investigator's family background came back to haunt her & she started to question about her own identity and about where her allegiance belonged to.  In the end, it doesn't matter because among the craziness of the world, humanity prevails.  Still, the notion about family members being segregated from one another for more than half a century by one line due to ideological difference is brought to forefront.  Moreover, we are also reminded constantly about the fragile truce between North & South Korea and a slight misunderstanding would undoubtedly start a civil war and would most certainly disturb the peace in the East Asia region.  A very well-made movie with tight script & good composition.  Highly recommended.  What made this movie different from ""A Few Good Men"" is that it doesn't provide a pedestal for the superstars to show off their acting skills but rather, all actors & actresses are making a cohesive effort to make this movie fluid and effective, which they have done to almost perfection.  Keep up the good work.",1069804800,5,1991,4.794721407624634
1725152,4,B0000687FL,"Joint Security Area drew many comparisons with Shiri, as it dealt with the same conflict and had some of the actors in both films.  Joint Security Area (often referred as JSA by Korean audience)  is not an action film per se, as Shiri was, and the story takes place in the Demilitarized Zone, an area that serves as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea, and describes the relationship between a South Korean soldier who befriends North Korean soldiers.  Interestingly, JSA drew more audience than Shiri.
  JSA is not an action film as Shiri was, but rather focused its theme to the unreal place, which is the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ.  DMZ is a neutral piece of land between the Koreas, where tensions are high due to possible military engagment by North Korea.  If a war was to take place again, it would start from DMZ.  Yet somehow a South Korean soldier finds friendship with couple of North Korean soldiers, and despite the initial hostility, they find common culural ties within themselves and grow close to each other.
  I liked JSA far better than Shiri, as it dealt with characters who were more believable and apporachable as compared to Shiri.  The atmosphere of the DMZ is captured quite nicely also.  It is simply a better film.  JSA is certainly a milestone in Korean cinema, albeit in a different way Shiri was.",1066521600,3,1341,4.703862660944206
1725153,5,B0000687FL,"I am a Korean and watched 'Joint Security Area' when in freshman year of university. I spent my childhood under anti-communism(exactly saying, Anti-North Korea) education and believed that North Koreans have devils horns and tails. Now, Im grown up enough to realize the fear was just crammed by the policy which wanted children to have the blind hatred for North Korea. However, after the removing the fear, because the fear was the only feeling for North Koreans that I had, the image of them had been left obscure in my mind for a long time. However this film gave me the chance to think about sincerely what meaning North Korea has for me. Though I do not still have the clear viewpoint of North Korea, at least the start is significant.
  This film keenly describes the dilemma that both North and South Koreans have at the base of hearts. The dilemma-whenever they see each other, they cannot but find brothers in the group of hostile ideology. Especially the scene of the farewell party in the film implies that the dilemmatic emotion is another link between North and South Koreans share. (Kim Kwang-suk, whom O Kyung-pil(acted by Song Gang-ho) toasted, is the singer of the background music, '  A Privates Letter at the scene. I don't know even the lyric is translated in the DVD version, yet,) The songs lyric is that a young man, who, in the compulsory military service, has to level a gun at the foe against his will, farewells to his irrevocable youthful days. The reason that the song was the favorite of both O Kyung-pil and Lee Su-heok(acted by Lee Beong-heon) is because the young man in the lyric is their own portraits.
  It is true that North Korea has threatened the world peace. Nevertheless, in the shell of Rougue State, the Axis of Evil, or whatever, South Korean cannot but find their Lost Brother.'Joint Security Area' delivers the dilemmatic sentiment, and it shows that this film is not just for amusement.",1053388800,5,1935,4.747023809523809
1725154,4,B0000687FL,"awsome movie, better than shiri in my oppinion. from what i've seen, korea is consistantly making the best movies these days. I was lucky enough to have a friend over there send me the 2-disk korean release, which is awsome quality, and packed with extras, and comes in a totally sweet box and sleeve. it's much better than the hong kong rellease for sale here, but this one is still pretty good.
and just as a response to one of the previous reviews: I thought the lead actress did well, and her accent was pretty good. The only thing i found wrong with her is how she supposedly has a white mother, and yet she looks 100% korean...

One night there is an exchange of fire across the JSA that interrupts the progress between the nations.  There seems to be two versions of the reason why two North Korean soldiers were killed on the North Korean side of the boarder.

Spotlighted as one of the most expensive & highest grossing domestic Korean films to date (ranking third in overall audience attendance in Korea for a domestic film, just behind ""Chingu"" [""Friend""] and ""Shiri"" [or ""Swiri""],  and just ahead of the quirky romantic comedy ""Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo"" [aka ""My Sassy Girl""], ""JOINT SECURITY AREA"" -- (Korean title: ""Gongdong Kyeongbi Kuyeok - JSA"") -- is one of those stories which starts off confusingly, but by the end ties everything together neatly and beautifully with some of the most sincere and genuine raw emotion ever experienced in a feature film.

""JSA"" begins with a couple of contradictory flashbacks of an assassination-type event which takes place in a guardshack North of the DMZ (demilitarized zone) in the Joint Security Area, each based on the 'official version' of the story as propogated by North and South. As the film progresses, we are pulled along by a third and equally contradictory flashback, this one apparently revealing the truth not only of that fateful night's event which nearly ignited a small war between the two Koreas, but also giving us insight as to what led up to that point, and does so very tenderly and emotionally.

The story revolves around an 'illegal' friendship forged between two pairs of soldiers stationed on opposite sides of the DMZ in the Joint Security Area, which began as a result of a nighttime border patrol team in the South getting disoriented and venturing too far north, accidently venturing into Kim Jung-Il's Communist state where one of the soldiers gets separated from the rest of the group and becomes stranded under frightening and dire circumstances in what is one of the most tense and dramatic moments of the film.

A secret correspondence is later initiated by the prodigal Southern soldier with the two Northern soldiers he encountered on that harrowing night. Before long, he receives an invitation to 'cross over the bridge which divides the two Koreas'-- literally and figuratively --and almost without hesitation accepts the offer to drop in for an ""unauthorized (to say the least) visit.""

No 'sensative secrets' are ever revealed or exchanged during these illegal meetings (as one of the Southern soldiers declares, ""We don't know anything, anyway""); What 'secrets' ARE exchanged, though, are those which come from the heart: stories of friends, family, homelife, personal goals, and hopes for a reunified nation of ""brothers"" fractured by ideological differences. It was also a nice touch that never at any time-- except in a moment of genuine curiousity or as a gesture of offered protection --does anyone of either side try to entice any of the others to defect to the other side.

But as with all beautifully and honestly executed thought-provoking cinematic masterpieces, something goes terribly wrong during one of the illegal visits, which results in ""murder"" (quote/unquote), cover-up, and threatened outbreak of war. It is left to a neutral investgative board to uncover the truth of what took place on that dark rainy night, and the case is assigned to a Korean native raised in Switzerland who carries with her a secret of her own which could raise questions about her 'objectivity' and very likely jeopardize her investigation even as the truth gradually unfolds .

Why this film never saw nationwide theatrical release in the U.S., apart from a few sporadic ""film festival"" venues, is completely beyond my comprehension. Perhaps seeing how well made this movie was, and how it held its own in its homeland by practically putting ""Titanic's"" Korean box office recepts to shame, maybe Hollywood got scared that its ego would get bruised even further if American audiences (already apathetic and dissatisfied with the declining quality of Hollywood films and their self-eroding committment to excellence) had wide access to this ""foreign"" film and responded favorably, as they surely would have.

Unlike many foreign films, which sometimes require a considerable amount of knowledge of the native culture to be genuinely appreciated and/or enjoyable, ""Joint Security Area"" is truly an ""international"" film, one to which anyone anywhere can easily relate. If allowed, this one movie could probably do a much more effective job of moving Korean reunification talks forward than all of the bureaucratic 'diplomacy' of the past decade.

On it's face it is the story of solders becoming friends across the Korean DMZ. An officer discovers the South Koreans having a 'party' with the North Koreans in the North Korean guard post. The South Koreans shoot their way out rather than being captured. The officer and one of the North Korean Guards is killed. One of the South Koreans is wounded but lives. Both South Koreans are highly depressed and the reason seems obvious but at the end it is not so clear.

**SPOILER** At the end it becomes apparent that the North Korean Sargent who survived was on a mission to make contact with South Koreans who he could then turn into agents in the south. Though wearing a Sargent's uniform he was really a political officer of much higher rank. He did not back down to the officer who discovered the 'party' with the South Koreans and even after the shootings claimed he could get things 'fixed'.

The acting was superb and believable. I don't think so far I have seen one movie that Song Kang-ho or Lee Byung-hun were in that I did not like, I tend to search out their films for viewing. Both are very talented actors and have a definite wide scope of parts they can play well. All the actors were really good in this though and the parts the main actors played were well written. Park Chan-wook did another excellent job directing this thriller. With the tight camera shots filmed inside the north Korean building at times you felt like you were somewhat of an intruder viewing very special friendship moments.  This is another movie that uses flashbacks to tell part of the story which can be a little confusing but by the end of the movie you understand what really happened. It's mostly a rather intimate portrait of friendship among four north and south Korean soldiers along the DMZ of the Korean penninsula. If you're expecting this to be a war movie you will be diappointed in it. I can see why the south Koreans found this film so moving and why it was so popular there.

There are some good actors -- especially the small group at the center of the story (special mention should go to the charismatic Song Kang-Ho&nbsp;] as the North Korean sargent). And, as is typical with Korean films, nice color photography but this time with a lot of tricky night scenes.

Also pleasing to watch is the stunningly beautiful Lee Young-Ae as the half-Korean Swiss officer heading the Swedish-Swiss investigation of the killings at a North Korean guardhouse by a South Korean soldier. Her character comes across as smart and determined. And she makes Korean sound like the most beautiful language in the world.

For the other Swiss-Swedish team members, I was relieved that they imported genuine European actors -- as opposed to using amateurs.

Like other South Korean films I've seen, this exhibits a wistfulness for renunification despite the ongoing tension. The outlook behind the story may be nave (ie, 'it's simple distrust that divides us' -- whereas an insightful story would analyze the history, politics and personalities behind the situation) but the story itself will probably work whatever your perspective.",1238976000,2,1393,5.3807339449541285

1725172,4,B0000687FL,"J.S.A.: Joint Security Area's success was Park Chan Wook's license to make any film he wanted; this film was Park's (Vengeance Trilogy) breakout hit in South Korea, and even though he wrote the script for ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" a few years before, ""J.S.A."" was made and released first. Most Korean political thrillers I've seen that delved into  the tension between North and South Korea such as the popcorn flick ""Shiri"" and ""Typhoon"" often somewhat portray the South Korean side the ""good guys"" while the North Korean side are oftentimes take a darker light as the ""bad guys"". Park Chan-Wook's masterpiece, however, stays neutral on this situation and the film is truly something that goes straight to the hearts and emotions of its audience.

Synopsis partly derived from back cover:
In the Demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea, peace is a very fragile thing, as fragile as the wooden bridge that links the two Koreas. When two North Korean soldiers are killed, supposedly by one South Korean soldier, it threatens to ignite a full-scale international conflict. An impartial Intelligence team led by a Korean female officer, Maj. Sophie Jean (Yeong Ae-Lee, Lady Vengeance) is sent to investigate and they quickly find flaws in the official report of the events. It's a race to uncover the truth as tensions rise in one of the most heavily guarded border in the world.

The film is an incredible tale of forbidden friendship that blossomed between border patrol soldiers that explores the consequences when something goes awry.  J.S.A. is a powerful and complex film that explores the honesty and the beauty of being close and comfortable towards your countryman. It is truly an engaging film about camaraderie and loyalty. The film also delves into the ideals of the Korean people, from both sides of the border. The film may have some similarities to ""Midnight Clear"" with a powerful metaphor for the rest of the world. What makes J.S.A. so special is that there are no clear good guys and bad guys, no black and white; the main antagonist (or bad guy) is the overall situation between the two countries itself, and the political ramifications of the incident. The North and South Korean people are the victims of this tension; victimized by an invisible enemy that cannot be seen but felt in their hearts.

When I first saw this film in 2003, I wasn't really expecting much. I thought it was just going to be another political thriller and while it does begin that way; Park definitely sidesteps that impression by putting the central focus of the film on 4 soldiers, their budding friendship and relationship, who are divided by nothing but the border shared by two on each side respectively. The four soldiers are played by Kang Ho-Song (Secret Sunshine), Lee Byung-Hun (A Bittersweet Life), Tae Woo-Kim and Ha-Kyun Shin. It's no surprise that Kang Ho-Song and Lee Byung Hun gives a remarkable performance as well as a younger Yeong Ae-Lee; the solid performances by its cast are the film's greatest strength. Park's style of direction is that the timeline shifts from past to present and vice versa to unveil the supposed incident of the breakout and the secret friendship between the four. This was an ingenious but risky style in storytelling; it may become a bit blurry and inexperienced watchers may find it a bit confusing and maybe boring. However, Park effectively allows us to get a lot deeper into the psyche of the Korean people in my opinion. The actual investigation itself may be the film's weakness; as the proceedings seemed too simple and some ""findings"" were too convenient.

It's quite sad to witness the tensions of a nation separated by its ideals and very inspiring to see just how the soldiers overcame the hostilities between their sides and encourage each other to ""breakdown the walls"" of politics. These soldiers represent their people and their hope for reconciliation. This theme hits home to the hearts of its audience. Their slight fear of being discovered is portrayed as they spend the evening playing cards and bonding in their own playful manner. The differences between the two sides are also expressed in the form of a simple ""cookie"" or chocolate bars.

J.S.A. is an actual metaphor for the rest of the world. It is quite sad for a country to be divided by an imaginary line. It effectively expresses the idea that social and political differences, color and blood, race and beliefs should not be allowed to become the bane of brotherhood and friendship. These invisible lines are things that should be forgotten and disposed of much like the soldiers in this film who reached out and became friends. Despite the film's faults that some scenes ""borders"" almost to the point of becoming too melodramatic, the film is quite effective with its cinematography, story and theme, that the great performances reaches out to inspire us with its humanity and optimism. It's very hopeful and powerful message is its true human splendor.

1725173,3,B0000687FL,"JSA: Joint Security Area (Chan-wook Park, 2000)

Chan-wook Park and Yeong-Ae Lee, who teamed up for the memorable Lady Vengeance a couple of years ago, first got together in 2000 for JSA, a conventional, if beautifully-shot, murder mystery.

The story: a South Korean soldier, Lee So-hyeok (Hero's Byung-Hyun Lee), stumbles across the border between North and South Korea, leaving the bodies of two dead North Korean soldiers, with another gravely wounded. The NNSC, who controls the Joint Security Area set up between the two nations, calls in Swiss investigator Sophie Jean (Yeong-Ae Lee) to figure out what actually happened, since no one's stories add up. As Jean gets closer to the truth, things get more and more wildly improbable, and those close to the case start using more extreme measures to prevent her getting at the truth.

JSA is not, unlike Park's more recent efforts, a great film. There are even some who have posited, despite the film's numerous awards, that it's not even a good film. I certainly wouldn't go that far, though there are a few times when the pacing of the film (which can be described sporadically as glacial) tried my patience. The acting is often competent at best, which doesn't help when the pace is reduced to just plodding along. What redeems the movie, to some extent at least, is that it's quite nice to look at. While you're waiting for the plot to start up again or for some decent acting to come along, you can always look at the scenery. ** ",1198108800,,1488,4.778210116731517

1725175,5,B0000687FL,"Some movies are just outright masterpieces: something that you wouldn't be able to change one frame because it's so perfect. Then you get those films that are outright terrible; simply because of a bad acting, script and others. Then we get films like Joint Security Area: they're great and entertaining but then there's something that nags that prevents from being given full marks. Kind of like not getting 100% on an exam because you filled in the circle half-way a la Homer. Of course I gave it 5 stars but you almost wish it did one thing differently so you can say it was a near-perfect film.

On the line dividing North and South Korea rests the Joint Security Area, a military outpost guarded by both sides forces. When a couple North Korean officers are found murdered and an officer from each side is taken into custody, a neutral Korean investigator from Switzerland, Sophie Jean, is brought in to figure out what happened that night while making sure she doesn't upset either side. Figuring out what happened and the personal matters that affected the soldiers from both sides is the fun in the movie.

I should get this out of the way. People will disagree with me on this and I did like its inclusion but it felt too long at times as well. We found out an interesting connection between the soldiers from both sides in flashbacks that reveal something different than just bitter enemies going at it. While it does humanize an event that was quickly labelled an attack on a government, there's so many scenes of it that it becomes less an exciting mystery and more like a well-made drama. That's all I'm going to say about the plot: don't expect you're walking into a massive shoot-em-up and you'll be just fine.

Where the film does work is its acting. Probably best known from Lady Vengeance, Lee-ae Young is a great and capable officer who tries to figure everything out. The rest of the cast is memorable as well, including the leads from Mr. Vengeance. For those of you looking for iconic images a la corridor fight in Oldboy or dogboy in Lady Vengeance will find a couple but they're not as pronounced but I love the ending where we scan over a photograph.

The problem with the DVD is not with the picture but with the sound. First of all, it boots up with the 5.1 English dub, which as you can guess, is horrendous. Then of course there's some hilarious subtitle errors including my favorite. The opening text reveals Korea free from ""Japaness rules"". The big faux-pas is the Korean soundtrack which is in 2.0. Yes...measly piece of elephant crap 2.0. This is a big blemish, especially since it's supposed to be the first and main soundtrack of the film.

When two North Korean soldiers are discovered dead, and two South Korean soldiers suspected in their murders, a team of neutral countries are gathered to determine the cause of what has happened: in which the fate of renewed hostilities between the two countries becomes all too real. I don't want to give out any spoilers in this film, therefore, I must leave out important information which will ruin the film for you if I divulge too much.

There is more to the deaths of the two North Korean soldiers, and the two South Korean soldiers being questioned by the neutral investigators that makes this film so different and outstanding. This is one of the better films to tackle a suspenseful subject matter that I have seen in a long, long time. The film moves between the present and the past. Each giving the viewer vignettes of what has transpired that has caused this tragedy. And although the film is tragic, there is also hope in the film: Hope for those who wish to see a better tomorow between this divided nation.

The storyline and cinematography is excellent, and as usual, Park Chan-wook weaves a magical tapestry of a film. He is truly one of the greatest directors in the business today. In fact, he is a directorial artist. [If there is such a  term] He has a vision of directing that very few in the business have today: Every subject matter he seems to tackle comes off brilliantly. I look forward to more of his films. [Take notice Hollywood!] I recommend the film highly, you will not be disappointed. Highly, highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1166140800,6,1739,4.751655629139073

1725178,5,B0000687FL,"This is an incredible movie that tells a story of friendship against a political backdrop. One night shots break out at the JSA leaving 2 North Korean soldiers dead, one south korean soldier in a catatonic shock, and another southern soldier suicidal. A Korean-Swiss soldier is assigned to the case to find out what happened, all the while maintaining her neutrality.

What unfolds is the story of a complex friendship between a pair of northern soldiers with a pair of southern soldiers. Chan Wook Park is gaining fame for his Revenge Trilogy as well as his part in Three... Extremes, but out of all his work it is JSA that stands out for me.

He handles the friendship between the soldiers masterfully; they form a strong bond, looking at each other as brothers, but at the same time there is a sense that the bond will be easily broken.

At the end, when we see that a throw away scene actually has a meaning, it is enough to bring a person to tears.",1147305600,13,953,4.497109826589595

Spotlighted as one of the most expensive & highest grossing domestic Korean films to date (ranking third in overall audience attendance in Korea for a domestic film, just behind ""Chingu"" [""Friend""] and ""Shiri"" [or ""Swiri""], and just ahead of the quirky romantic comedy ""Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo"" [aka ""My Sassy Girl""], ""JOINT SECURITY AREA"" -- (Korean title: ""Gongdong Kyeongbi Kuyeok - JSA"") -- is one of those stories which starts off confusingly, but by the end ties everything together neatly and beautifully with some of the most sincere and genuine raw emotion ever experienced in a feature film.

""JSA"" begins with a couple of contradictory flashbacks of an assassination-type event which takes place in a guardshack North of the DMZ (demilitarized zone) in the Joint Security Area, each based on the 'official version' of the story as propogated by North and South. As the film progresses, we are pulled along by a third and equally contradictory flashback, this one apparently revealing the truth not only of that fateful night's event which nearly ignited a small war between the two Koreas, but also giving us insight as to what led up to that point, and does so very tenderly and emotionally.

The story revolves around an 'illegal' friendship forged between two pairs of soldiers stationed on opposite sides of the DMZ in the Joint Security Area, which began as a result of a nighttime border patrol team in the South getting disoriented and venturing too far north, accidently venturing into Kim Jung-Il's Communist state where one of the soldiers gets separated from the rest of the group and becomes stranded under frightening and dire circumstances in what is one of the most tense and dramatic moments of the film.

A secret correspondence is later initiated by the prodigal Southern soldier with the two Northern soldiers he encountered on that harrowing night. Before long, he receives an invitation to 'cross over the bridge which divides the two Koreas'-- literally and figuratively --and almost without hesitation accepts the offer to drop in for an ""unauthorized (to say the least) visit.""

No 'sensative secrets' are ever revealed or exchanged during these illegal meetings (as one of the Southern soldiers declares, ""We don't know anything, anyway""); What 'secrets' ARE exchanged, though, are those which come from the heart: stories of friends, family, homelife, personal goals, and hopes for a reunified nation of ""brothers"" fractured by ideological differences. It was also a nice touch that never at any time-- except in a moment of genuine curiousity or as a gesture of offered protection --does anyone of either side try to entice any of the others to defect to the other side.

But as with all beautifully and honestly executed thought-provoking cinematic masterpieces, something goes terribly wrong during one of the illegal visits, which results in ""murder"" (quote/unquote), cover-up, and threatened outbreak of war. It is left to a neutral investgative board to uncover the truth of what took place on that dark rainy night, and the case is assigned to a Korean native raised in Switzerland who carries with her a secret of her own which could raise questions about her 'objectivity' and very likely jeopardize her investigation even as the truth gradually unfolds .

Why this film never saw nationwide theatrical release in the U.S., apart from a few sporadic ""film festival"" venues, is completely beyond my comprehension. Perhaps seeing how well made this movie was, and how it held its own in its homeland by practically putting ""Titanic's"" Korean box office recepts to shame, maybe Hollywood got scared that its ego would get bruised even further if American audiences (already apathetic and dissatisfied with the declining quality of Hollywood films and their self-eroding committment to excellence) had wide access to this ""foreign"" film and responded favorably, as they surely would have.

Unlike many foreign films, which sometimes require a considerable amount of knowledge of the native culture to be genuinely appreciated and/or enjoyable, ""Joint Security Area"" is truly an ""international"" film, one to which anyone anywhere can easily relate. If allowed, this one movie could probably do a much more effective job of moving Korean reunification talks forward than all of the bureaucratic 'diplomacy' of the past decade.",1126396800,25,4374,5.197443181818182

The daughter of a North Korean expatriate is assigned the investigation-and though she uncovers the truth--it is a truth she cannot fully reveal.

1725182,5,B0000687FL,"This is the movie that lent me a first peek into the collective consciousness of the South Korean people. It is a love letter from the South to the North. Given the fact it set box office record when it opened in Korea, I conclude most Koreans subscribe to the movie's sentiments, and that makes them a loving, tolerant and sensible people in my mind.

If one's to draw analogy between this and other movies, ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Americanization of Emily"" come to mind. All three carried similar messages: War is absurd; in a paranoid and hostile world, reason, intellect and humanity are no match for some lunatics or brain-washed zealots. (BTW, I think Americanization of Emily should've ended with the Omaha Beach landing scene.) All three are extremely apt in driving their powerful messages home. Of the three, JSA is the most aesthetically pleasing and emotionally intimate. It portrays the preciousness of life and friendship so beautifully, and death and destruction so relentlessly, that the audiences have no choice but to be affected.

It is not perfect. The English language scenes are weak as some earlier reviews indicated, but they are brief and don't affect the flow and mood of the film.

Definitely not to be missed and destined to be a classic.",1121299200,9,1269,4.8930232558139535

The South says that North tried to kidnap a South Korean solider, while the North states that a South Korean solider went amok.

1725184,5,B0000687FL,"Those who study, or have lived in, Korea will appreciate the dynamism and importance of this impeccably made film.  Outside of a passing awareness most Americans have no idea what the split nations of south and north Korea mean.  This film captures, in a slowly building awareness, the true tragedy and heart break that is the modern Korean nation: one racially, ethnically and culturally monolithic people harshly divided in two with one the last vestige of a dead socioeconomic theory (communism) and the other a raging Asian Tiger and the world's 11th largest economy.  While the north has clearly lost this last stand off of the Cold War, the nations remain divided and JSA does a superb job of bringing this into the human dimension.  Note the subtle jabs at the US as well as the neutral nations.  This gives Americans a view into a world most do not understand, but one that could consume our military in a flash.

I have many Korean friends here in this beautiful country I now call my home(for the next few years). After seeing this, I feel differently than I did before seeing it. I feel like I have grown as a human after the experience watching JSA has given me. I think everyone living in Korea certainly should see this film.

There has been no peace in Korea since 1945.  The Korean War divided the country much as the civil war could have done to the USA.  There is always hope that there will be reunification and this movie does a great job building that hope.

7964201,2,B0000687FL,"This film is from South Korea and it was supposed to be good.  Apparently the standards for good in Korean filmmaking are quite different from Hollywood standards, which aren't all that high.  I note that most reviewers give this film high ratings.  It probably comes across way more powerfully if you understand Korean, which I do not.  I was trying to follow this film with English dubbed in and English subtitles, and I have to say, that is a grave mistake.

J.S.A. stands for Joint Security Areaa location along the DMZ (de-militarized, aka intensely militarized) zone between South and North Korea, at which international peace-keeping forces are stationed and representatives from the two sides can meet to negotiate their differences.
The basis for the story is a bizarre event involving front-line soldiers from the two sides.  Something went terribly wrong.  A bunch of (maybe 5) Northern soldiers were shot and killed, at least one South Korean soldier was also killed, while another, who limped away and was rescued, is being hailed as a hero by the South.  The two sides have radically different versions of the events.  South Korean media are announcing that the Northerners kidnapped a Southern soldier, or pressured him to defect, and the other members of his squad rescued him in a shoot-out.  The North says nonsensefive of our guys are dead and only one Southernerthe South clearly started this, and is trying to blame it all on the North as usual.

A female Korean with Swiss citizenship, is assigned the conflicted task of getting to the bottom of it allbut only if that bottom doesnt actually blame either side, because that could trigger a conflagration while tempers on both sides are running so high.  Well, she starts to investigate and she soon begins to learn that the truth really is NOT so simple, nor one-sided.

Now that sounds as if it could be a great suspense film.  Perhaps it could be great in the Korean.  Unfortunately when the original Korean dialog was dubbed over into English for an English-speaking audience, and there are ALSO English sub-titles available, CLEARLY whoever translated the dialog for the voice-over had absolutely no coordination with the person doing the subtitlingplus at least one if not both must have been drunk as well.  The text is often so far from the English voice-over that its completely distracting, and almost like listening to two movies simultaneously.  I know, I knowI could have TURNED OFF the sub-titling and just listenedbut the voice-over was also moronic.  The written sub-titling might have been closer to the original so there I was, between Scylla and Charybdisdamned with the subtitles, and damned without.
