2384383,2,B000AC7OZ2,"Samurai Deeper Kyo is a well crafted story hampered by uninspired characters, boring fight scenes, and too many cheap animation tricks (recycled footage, sections where the only thing that moves is the character's lips, etc.). The only redeeming feature is that the series is broken up into several tightly scripted lesser story arcs instead of being one long, dragging story.",1207353600,,376,5.283333333333333
2384384,1,B000AC7OZ2,"If you like samurai-themed action, dark and mysterious characters, and a decent plot, then Samurai Deeper Kyo is an anime worth checking out.  Plus, if you're a fan of any of the 4KIDS anime, you may recognize some of the voices.",1162512000,,229,4.585365853658536
2384385,2,B000AC7OZ2,"I'm not an anime hater, infact I think that anime is very underestimated in America because when people think of cartoons they don't think about and engrossing drama with well thought out characters and animation that's artistically drawn with more time consuming details than most people would think.

I purchased Samurai Deeper Kyo hoping to be surprised by another anime, but I was let down, the animation is horrible, in every scene the picture stops and all you can see is the lips moving, or you can see one character striking a pose and thats dragged all over the scene, now that's just plain lazyness due in part to the artist, now I know what you're thinking, you're thinking that that's how most things are in anime, but you won't undestand it til you see it, it's almost as if they just show you pictures and someone's acting it out on the side.  Another aspect that makes this series dull is that you never really care for the characters, if something happens to any of them you could care less, now I know this was a manga before and the producers had to cut the story short, but this series goes nowhere, there are too many characters and sometimes I felt forced to watch the episodes just to finish the series, this way I wouldn't think I spent my money on trash.  The story is simple, two legendary swordsman: Demon Eye Kyo and Kioshiri Mibu, fight four years ago, then a meteor hits that makes many humans into kenyou(humans that can transform into monsters)Kioshiri re-appers and is now a medicine sales man whose personality turns into Demon Eye Kyo when faced with difficulties. Like all other anime we meet the supporting characters and of course they have to go on some quest, of what I can't tell you as to not give away plot lines but if your easily amused then this might be for you but this has nothing that'll make you ever see it again.",1154131200,3,1864,4.525222551928783
2384386,4,B000AC7OZ2,"Samurai Deeper Kyo isn't an anime for the Action Junkie, lovesick, or those that suffer from ADD. That is because this anime was adapted from a manga that isn't complete, and at the same time they had to finish it in 26 episodes (not an easy task) the story is quite natural in the begining, first all the root characters are introduced and the ambitions of those revealed. this seems to set you up for a story that makes you ask these questions: 1) How did Kyo end up in this predicament? 2) What purpose could Yuya play in Kyo's story? and, 3) How is a wacky story like this supposed to end? haha, all these questions are answered. one review said that the way kyo and kyoshiro ended up in the same body was never answered. He wasn't paying attention, it was dead obvious.

  Now, don''t get me wrong, its not the best anime ever, but its far from bad. Pay attention, and listen to what the characters say and their relationships. Don't be one of those people who rag on a good series because of your lack of attention. If your the type who gets distracted easily or doesn't do a recap inside their own head may have to watch the series more than once to put all the pieces together. It is an anime of an unfinished manga series, so the perceptive can tell that toward the end they had to force a solid definate ending that would more than likely be better or different if they weren't limited to 26 episodes. In my book its a buy, not a must buy, but definately worth the sit down. I liked it and i'm sure if you just watch and listen, you'll like it too, or at least be satisfied. It won't make your top ten list but will be enjoyed.

  Its a solid anime if your a patient person, the impatient will be too busy complaining about how much they don't know during the series(you won't truly know whats going on completely until the very end.) and many abstract concepts and ways of thinking are added to the anime.

  If your familiar with Japanese history(story revolves around real life people events around the Tokugawa era.) or are a samurai fan, you'll enjoy it more than others. Its not an anime thirst quencher but it gets really close, this was an uphill batte for the developers and my respect for doing a feat such as this as well as they did makes me like the anime more.  well take care people.",1140566400,24,2308,4.309468822170901
2384387,3,B000AC7OZ2,"Samurai Deeper Kyo, based upon a comic of the same name, starts off in a way most anime does. It goes fairly quickly through an introduction of the characters, which are a bit cliche, but good enough at first to justify watching. However after the first few episodes, the series takes a turn for the worst. And even in the beginning episodes, there's some strange stuff going on.

Apparently there was a meteor that hit the earth and caused people to turn into half demons, who could shed their human skin at will. The main character is a swordsman named Kyoshiro, who, in the anime style, has an alternate personality of another swordsman he fought before inside of him. How that other person got there, a man with godly powers known as Demon Eyes Kyo, is never explained. As Kyo awakes, he joins up with a bounty hunter girl named Yuya, who is searching for her brother's killer, and collecting money from bounties. After a while, they rack up some more characters, including the shoganate's son, and an ex-samurai named Yukimura.

That first 12 episodes are surprisingly good. There's some cool fights, and a tournament. Aside from the demons, everything seems a bit more grounded in reality than the rest of the series. However past the episode 12 mark, things get crazy. A hard-to-follow plot line involving Oda Nobunaga, 12 evil guys, nurses with guns (in the samurai era?!) and a made-for-TV character searching for things to 'unite the world back to it's rightful place' makes this series almost impossible to follow. The final battle is actually held in the future, and references are made to things which are never tied up.

I suppose you have to give the people who made this series some credit. The comic which this is based off of goes in so many different directions, that reading it all at once would confuse you even more than this anime does. As long as you can deal with the absurd, and like swords, this anime is okay. However the powers certain characters have, like the ability to summon fire, ice, or electricity out of their swords is really crappy and badly done. Overall, the best episodes are found in the first 8 episodes, but if you really like Samurai, I suppose you could justify buying this series.",1132876800,5,2229,4.695652173913044

2384390,5,B000AC7OZ2,"This show reminds me alot of Inuyasha, and Basilisk, not really in the stories (believe it or not) but in the pacing. Despite what people say this is one of Anime Works/Media Blasters better dubs and I quite enjoy the series. I find the main character very likable, and how the series controls information is very fascinating. Throughout the dvd I find myself curious about each characters past, and enjoy the tact used in the battles. Many people say this series is very average, well honestly I think it is the best samurai anime I own. I would suggest it.",1393632000,,558,4.59

2384392,4,B000AC7OZ2,it you have read the manga and expect a great anime you are going to be disappointed (or so I hear). I've never read the manga so I went into it blind and yes it's not awesome but its fine. mostly got it for the bloopers and to hear Dan Green,1366934400,,242,3.764705882352941
2384393,2,B000AC7OZ2,Any Fan of the original Samurai Deeper Kyo Manga will be greatly disappointed in the anime. The plot line is way off and Frankly is just a basic Shonen plot. The plot of the manga is indefinately better and the characters aren't as believeable in the anime. SO if anyone who read  the manga is looking to buy this Dont!!!!!!,1353369600,,324,4.4
2384394,4,B000AC7OZ2,"In the year 1600 two warriors disappeared from the battlefield at Sekigahara when a meteor crashed. Those warriors names were Kyoshiro Mibu and ""Demon Eyes"" Kyo. 4 years later a bounty hunter named Yuya captures Kyoshiro. She soon finds out that he is sharing a body with the soul of ""Demon Eyes"" Kyo. I bought this series a DVD at a time when it came out. It's a visually stunning anime. It also has very good voice acting and music. There are also a lot of cool characters that use some awesome techniques. It gets very weird at the end though. This anime does lack something that is hard to put my finger on. I think for me it would have been more interesting if there had been a little more emotion between Yuya and Kyo. The struggle he had within him and his feelings for Yuya may have made the series 5 stars for if they were explored little more. All in all this is an impressive series and it's a good buy.",1350518400,2,914,4.258620689655173
2384395,1,B000AC7OZ2,the what when how syndrome is through out this anime. it seemed to be missing parts of the story line. i was watching it closely because i have tried 3 times to watch this and each time i wonder how did we get to this place. i did find out that the english dub voices are really bad. switch to the sub the voices really fit well. basically it is one of those anime if you have nothing else to watch maybe try this/,1297468800,,414,3.9404761904761907
2384396,1,B000AC7OZ2,"At the battle of Sekigahara, the infamous Demon Eyes Kyo fought against Kyoshiro Mibu. Then a CGI meteor hit, samurai turned into monsters, and Kyo and Kyoshiro ended up being roommates in the same body.

Unfortunately, the adaptation of Akimine Kamijyo's ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" doesn't really improve after that. That the scriptwriters threw out most of the manga's storyline, shuffled around what was left, and threw in a bunch of ugly shapeshifting monsters. The result is a bizarre, strangely scattered anime that's riddled with plot holes and bizarre action scenes (porn nurses? Space ninjas?).

Four years after Sekigahara, bounty hunter Yuya Shiina nabs a minor criminal, the harmless wandering medicine man Kyoshiro Mibu. But she soon finds out that Kyoshiro has another personality inside him -- Demon Eyes Kyo. And though Kyoshiro is usually the dominant personality, it doesn't take long for Kyo to come out (seemingly for good).

Oh, and unsurprisingly Kyo wants his body back, but doesn't know where it is. He and Kyoshiro also seem to have a connection to a young woman named Sakuya.

But it turns out that there are a lot of people (and monstrous shapeshifting kenyou) entangled with Kyo/Kyoshiro as well -- along with the femme fatale Okuni and ambitious ex-general Yukimura Sanada, Kyo and Yuya venture into the deadly Sea of Trees to find a mysterious man known as ""His Majesty,"" but must fight a group of superpowered kenyou who guard him. And from there they set out to attack the powerful Mibu clan, who have their own plans for Kyo's powerful body.

For the record: an anime adaptation doesn't have to be slavishly faithful to the manga for me to enjoy it. But it DOES have to make sense. And unfortunately ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" doesn't make sense -- it's like the writers crammed the manga into a blender, threw in a bunch of generic monsters, and never bother to actually make one thing logically follow another.

The first half of the series is downright lazy -- everytime something interesting happens, it turns out to be the fault of the kenyou. Then suddenly the entire focus shifts to the Mibu clan... just in time for the series to get hastily wrapped up in the most absurd manner possible. As a result, the series is a surreal, clumsy mess, full of gaping plot holes, hit-or-miss fights (a deadly fighter just STANDS there while Yukimura sprints several yards and stabs him?), and half-baked political tangles. Even the humor is wrong -- funny moments like Yukimura's gleeful ""the plan... is a secret!"" are always a beat off.

It also seems like the animators were either clumsy or lazy -- the episodes are crammed with still shots (especially for simple stuff like talking and walking) and dismally obvious errors. On the other hand, the outtakes are brilliant -- Dan Green is especially fun (""I gotta pee!""), but almost everybody produces some hilarious stuff (""Mizuchi is blowing from inside you..."" ""Excuse me, I just had a burrito"")

Even the characters don't work, though they're fascinating in concept. Kyo is introduced as a bloodthirsty, terrifying man... but not only does the ""thousand man slayer"" hardly ever kill anybody, but he becomes a sentimental mushball at random times. The same thing happens to the fight-happy goofball Benitora (I thought he hated his dad?). Yukimura is a far more interesting character -- a laid-back nobleman who always seems cheerful and flirtatious), but can be as deadly as Kyo.

""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" had plenty of promise, but for some reason the writers went out of their way to squander every shred of it.",1272672000,,3580,4.9335548172757475
2384397,4,B000AC7OZ2,"While the series is interesting I couldn't tell you hardly anything about it before I purchased it, even though I watched the entire series over 4 years ago. I bought it for another anime friend as an Xmas present knowing she would die over the out-takes.

Pretty entertaining with the typical subplot, Samurai kills off another samurai monster who'd slain hundreds of people only to find out that the mind of the evil samurai is now trapped in the mind of the guy who slew him. Best yet, he doesn't remember any of it! He believes he's a wandering perverted medicine man. Girl captures perverted man, whole ""Demon Eyes Kyo"" comes out, lots of fighting, lots of other characters who fight better than Kyo and then the girl falls for Kyo or the other guy who Kyo's mind is trapped inside of. Never did figure that one out.

Does have a way different twisted ending than you'd expect. On a plus note, the ending is not horribly depressing or heart-wrenching sad. Not the best ending it could have afforded but its better than EVA. OMG!

Serious, watch the out-takes. They are totally the best part.",1261008000,,1096,4.61025641025641
8077671,5,B000AC7OZ2,"Otaku John here, the super-fan of anime / manga / and light novels, to review another entertaining anime series: Samurai Deeper Kyo.  Okay, to start with, yes I'll admit this anime does vary quite a bit from the original manga.  However, the series is quite entertaining on its own.  (BTW, there's a ton of anime that deviate from the canon of manga, just to fit in time constraints and make the anime series more appealing to a wider variety of audiences).  That being said, Samurai Deeper Kyo still hits 5-stars on all levels.  In my opinion it has one of the best opening credits sequences in anime. Has great animation, perfect voice acting, fast-paced storyline, and is probably one of the best ""samurai"" themed animes out there.  Heads above Basilisk.  Don't let the quirky Kyoshiro Mibu throw you at first.  Sure he seems goofy and too young to be the bearer of Demon Eyes Kyo's soul, but after a few episodes, his image develops to be the same as Demon Eyes Kyo, save for a different color of eyes, and ends up being even more powerful than Kyo.  (don't want to give away too much, I don't like spoilers).  Anyway, this series is super-entertaining, and the history of Muramasa sword will blow you away, as will the historical samurai chants for their various fighting technique styles (often called fencing techniques in Japanese) , i.e.: ""Mumyou Jinpuu Ryuu Satsujin Ken "". (sword of a devilish wind), which gives rise to the famous tag-line,  ""You heard it too, didn't you?  The voice of the wind.""  You'll be cheering for both Kyo and Kyoshiro all the way to the end, and the end doesn't disappoint either.  If you love samurai and / or anime, you've got to get this set.  Can be hard to find too, so Amazon is your best bet.",1503878400,,1737,4.576051779935275

8077675,4,B000AC7OZ2,"The anime is really very good, but unfortunately pales in comparison to the manga. Much of my disappointment comes from Studio Deen's bizarre decision to make many major and minor villains morph into b-movie-esque monsters. This ruins many otherwise amazing fight scenes, which is a shame because the animation wasn't bad for it's time. I must ask, Why would you change a story whose basis is Samurai vs. Samurai into Samurai vs. Monsters? I am perfectly fine with an adaptation taking a different direction than the source material. For example, FMA '03 eventually became little to nothing like it's manga's final product but I can appreciate the fact that it still is an interesting story with it's own distinct messages. That is not the case with Samurai Deeper Kyo. The changes do not help it stand out on it's own, rather, they bog it down. They make it less than it should have been. And that is what disappoints me about this anime. If adapted correctly, It could have been up there with Yu Yu Hakusho, Rurouni Kenshin, and Berserk. And yet, it still seems as though I am unable to give it less than four stars. For all of the flaws it has, it is actually a very entertaining show overall.
