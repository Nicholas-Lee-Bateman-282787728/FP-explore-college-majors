7749513,5,B01F9A96L4,"The 80-minute (6-reel) silent film that forms the core of this wonderful (and historically important) Bluray release from Milestone Films is not a cowboy and Indians western, as we are accustomed to. It is an Indian (more correctly, a a Native American) film which was filmed 100%on the prairie of Oklahoma in 1920 and starred a 100% Kiowa and Comanche cast of actors. It was considered lost until a print was found about a decade ago and the 35mm print was lovingly restored at UCLAs film lab. A new score was composed and recorded by student orchestra at the Oklahoma City University School of Music and it looks great!

We actually get to see real Native Americans living the way they did (and riding horses bareback).  While Im not a huge Western fan, I was fascinated by the film from a historical and cultural viewpoint. I was also immersed in the many bonus interviews that the Oklahoma Historical Society  which acquired the film (with some help from the Smithsonian and two private donors)  did with the restorers and those involved in acquiring the film. Adding to those are interviews with three women whose parents (or grandparents) were actually in the film! The joy on their faces and in their voices as they relate their feelings upon seeing the film for the first time is contagious.
This is, not only, an entertaining fictional film, but a document that can be used in educational institutions to show the 21st century students what Native American life was really like.

I think Milestone should be commended on making this package available for all to see. The company provided me with an advance copy in exchange for an OBJECTIVE review.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8760485,4,B01F9A96L4,"but this one is worth having in your silent film collection. The movie looks as good as the ""White"" films of the period which I think were mostly made in New York or Los Angeles, Oklahoma for ""Dawn"". The story is OK but not great, most of the ""action"" looks pretty good (you see a Buffalo herd but you don't see the hunters actually among them).
The ""Indians"" are real (pleasant surprise there), the main (only?) extras are some interviews done years ago with surviving relatives, in color.not captioned/subtitled, you'll possibly need to turn up the volume to hear some of them.
Not a bad Indians only ""Western"", for any time period.",1499904000,,634,4.669642857142857

I first saw this when it was featured on Netflix, and when we stopped using Netflix, I decided to see if Amazon carried this movie. Thankfully it did. It's as great as I remember it - very happy with this purchase!",1485648000,,261,4.24
8760487,3,B01F9A96L4,"An exceedingly simple story has few surprises. It does a good job in depicting it's Indians as mild mannered, simple primitives rather than the wild, violent savages other films showed.",1482364800,,185,5.2

It was restored from 1920 so we did not expect a lot.  :)  We were very happy to see it because the female star, Esther LeBarre, is my husband's great Aunt.  We have been told she was very beautiful in person.  We found it interesting that she played a Kiowa, as did White Parker, and both of them are Comanche.",1470700800,8,376,4.180555555555555

i loved the movie too..... only about 20-30%? of the movies from the 1920's have survived ,
so this is a rare movie..",1469404800,7,214,4.35
