8156999,4,B000HAYPSG,"I initially wanted to watch this movie to see another film with Lee Byung-hun in it as I had seen him in Addicted, I Saw The Devil and A Bittersweet Life and liked him in those films and thought he was a very good actor.  This movie is a real departure from the other movies I had seen him in. In this movie he plays an outgoing, exuberant, chance taking, young man who wants to have a movie script he has been writing accepted by a Hollywood director and for the film to star Meg Ryan. You can't help liking his character as his optimism, unbridled enthusiasm and hope are contagious. He meets up with a man who is a musician but who is suffering with total despair and alcoholism over his brother's suicide and he decides to help him. The two of them have some adventures trying to evade the corrupt police who want to charge the musician with murdering his brother. There is also a side plot of the musician falling in love with a music store owner. This is not a deep movie, the musician (played by Shin Hyeon Jun)hardly has any dialogue at all and is a moody, brooding person due to his abusive childhoood and his brother's suicide. The characters are not really fleshed out well and the plot is easy to follow. Still, you can relate to the circumstances in which they find themselves and you continue watching to see the outcome of their improbable friendship. It's just a sweet, simple, little caper that ends in tragedy for one and happiness for the other. I enjoyed it as something different and I did think that Lee Byung hun did a very good acting job in it. I can't imagine anyone else giving it 4 stars but something in it struck a chord with me. Now I want to watch another movie with the guy who played the musician, Shin Hyeon Jun, as I found myself attracted to his sad character in this movie Lament.",1335744000,,1818,4.347058823529411
