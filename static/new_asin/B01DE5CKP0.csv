7711813,5,B01DE5CKP0,"The task that the Ultimate Reality Course sets for itself is perhaps the most challenging ever attempted, that of sifting through all of the worlds collection of wisdom teachings and presenting their essential common transformative message in ways that countless religions have apparently failed to do.  It does so by tapping into a unique and beautifully done video art form that engages the eyes as well as the ears, intellect and heart.  By adding visual imagery accompanied by beautifully aligned music and masterful narration, the healing messages that are hidden in full view in the worlds prominent, and often warring religions, are more easily seen.

The Ultimate Reality is for those struggling to find meaning in life as well as for those wishing to enhance an already rich inner life.",1459036800,,795,5.1

8755642,5,B01DE5CKP0,"For years some of humankinds greatest minds and thinkers from Benjamin Franklin to Albert Einstein, has said that our technology has far surpassed are sociology, psychology and yes, spirituality. I believe The Ultimate Reality Course is a step in the right direction with this Imbalance between our humanity vs. our technology. The course is professionally produced, filmed and entertaining as well; the music, the interviews, testimonies, animation and presenter Michael May, all work as one to transform some philosophically deep, deep stuff into accessible layman type input.
Also whats so cool about this course is, that its designed to be viewed multiple times as a way of reinforcing what youve already learned, and because theres so much depth of thought, research and wisdom packed into it, youll discover something new each time you view it. Lately its been like a spiritual friend to me, there when I need some guidance, some help with my personal journey to live an authentic life. I highly recommend this course to anyone and to particular those who have found the traditional religious approach to spirituality to be unfulfilling, primitive even.
So yes, the evolution of humanitys psychology, sociology and spirituality is here and The Ultimate Reality has just pulled into the station, All aboard! Next stop, a better world.",1463011200,,1339,5.232558139534884
8755643,5,B01DE5CKP0,"The Ultimate Reality is the second video series produced by Interior Mythos Journeys and streaming on their website as part of its Life Journeys curriculum. The Ultimate Reality is divided into three stations, entitled Free Fall, The Great Practice, and Knowing the Unknowable. All of the video presentations use three techniques: (1) voice-overs with brief and extended quotes from mystics, philosophers, theologians, coaches, and psychologists accompanied by appropriate video footage, (2) videotaped interviews, and (3) excerpts from lectures or presentations. Some of the presentations also use animated segments. The content of the first station focuses on the end of the world as we know it and the beginning of a decentered world without layers or horizons. This presentation ends with a moving segment on the Pale Blue Dot photograph of the planet Earth taken from the Voyager 1 space probe, which sandwiches Carl Sagans 1994 reflections between two key moments from Michael Mays lecture on it. The content of the second station is the link between everyday practices of excellence and contemplative practice. It intersperses interview footage with a young tennis player, a triathlete, a yoga instructor, a writer, and a furniture maker with quotations from Shunyru Suzuki and other contemplatives. It ends by suggesting that the Great Practice behind all practices is living in reality. The six video presentations comprising the final  station all address what living in reality means. These presentations include content that will be familiar to veterans of the Ecumenical Institute and RS-1. They make extensive use of the faces, voices, and thought of Jack Gilles and Gene Marshall, both veterans of the Institute. There is also plenty here, including a kind of music video of a song called Youre Still Gonna Die that is fresh, funny, and scary all at the same time.

The content is thoughtfully developed, and in sequence makes a persuasive case for developing a new way of doing the Great Practice with a new mythology that can communicate the aim of this practice in our new horizonless, decentered world. It draws  on the RS-1 tradition but also other strands of contemporary thought that address our profound humanness. Quite apart from the content, the videography, editing, music, and sound demonstrate care, attention to quality, and a profound artistic sensibility. The juxtaposition of Gene Marshalls resonant voice reading from his work and the video artistry is quite effective. Like the Interior Mythos Journeys website, the video series is visually stunning and well- crafted. Although the series stands on its own as an art form, it would also work well as a part of a self-study or group study program.",1459728000,,2731,5.259174311926605
8755644,5,B01DE5CKP0,"Wonderful experience!  I have always been intrigued how we as individuals, reflect upon ourselves.  The Ultimate Reality gives careful thought to what reality means to each one of us.  It gives us an opportunity to look inside ourselves and try to find the spirit that guides us in our daily lives.  This series gives meaning to life in a self reflecting way.  I would recommend this to anyone, or group, looking for true purpose in our daily lives.",1459555200,,449,4.705128205128205
8755645,5,B01DE5CKP0,"I was curious, not sure what to expect. Very glad that I did. The video segments are of the highest quality, the quotes and dialogue well integrated. Experiencing this with others was actually an important part of the process. ULC was an enlightening adventure, guiding me to view living (and death) from a new perspective.",1459468800,,323,4.890909090909091
8755646,5,B01DE5CKP0,"Having spent 40 years participating in an inquiry around what it is to be human and creating our worlds from being, I signed up for this course in person to see what they had to offer.  I am a believer that all paths (or most) spiritual and philosophical, are similar and of value.  I can only review this course from my 40 years of ongoing participation in est/Landmark Education and before that some years of Esalen and other consciousness evolving experiences.  I am happy to report that while this was not transformational for me, as the Landmark work has been, I found it refreshing and supported me in keeping me inquiring into the great mystery of life, which is always my intention. The course continued to put out questions that were not to be answered, which is always the best way to avoid our  brains coming up with limiting explanations for life. While I do not know how others who have perhaps not had so many  years of inquiry into all of it have responded, I assume that if they came with an open mind, they would have gotten great value in the continual opening of a path to the 'ultimate reality' as it is called in this course.  I will continue to visit the web site and do some group exercises, as I found that very helpful in the ground conversations.  My inquiries the days lie in finding ways to be complete with my life as I approach death in the next however many years remain.  Others are likely on paths to enrich their lives with many decades in front of them. Both of these paths can be supported with this course.",1459382400,,1543,4.427561837455831

8755649,5,B01DE5CKP0,"Sometimes I feel like I'm living my life at warp speed with no guardrails!  Not a good idea.  This course guided me to quiet deep places within and allowed space to share.  The 'movies' were beautiful, the questions provided were thought provoking and the instructor did a great job of pulling it all together.",1459123200,2,310,4.703703703703703
8755650,5,B01DE5CKP0,"This material is compiled in a deeply thoughtful and supportive way. The video segments are professionally shot and edited with beautiful music and voice-overs. So, it is a quality product. But it is the content and the way it is organized that matters most. The ideas within are framed in ways that we can all understand and may accept. This is a modern spiritual journey, which is at times challenging and ultimately comforting. It does not rely on established spiritual stories, but acknowledges the roles each has served over history. This is a guide to understanding our own spiritual stories as we have experienced them in our individual lives and a pathway to gratitude for ourselves just as we are in our lives at this moment. It is also a call to action for each one of us to be conscious of our spiritual journey every minute of our lives.",1459036800,,849,4.666666666666667
