8213635,5,B000UL61F2,"A few years ago I had the opportunity to work on the crew of a documentary about a Russian cosmonaut. We trekked out to Auerbach, Germany and inhabited a mock up of the MIR space station (once used to train Russian cosmonauts but since decommissioned) for three days interviewing a famous cosmonaut who flew in from Moscow for this project.

Having had the chance to immerse myself in Russian space politics/culture I conjured an aesthetic atmosphere that only existed in my mind but was made up of equal parts of 'Ostalgie', Soviet socialist poster-art and blinking clunky Soviet spacecraft control panel. A strange brew that I enjoyed reflecting on from time to time.

Then I happened upon this gem of a film. I watched in hypnotic splendor as the NASA footage rolled by with sub-titles and grainy voice-overs, cosmonauts performed calisthenics while strapped into their space capsule to a majestic music score and competing female field hockey teams arranged themselves into the shape of a hammer & sickle on a grassy playing field.

I can't recommend this film highly enough. It is the film I wish I had worked on instead of the one filmed in the pretend MIR space station.

Marvelous work by a true comrade! :)",1200268800,2,1215,4.826923076923077
