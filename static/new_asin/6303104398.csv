The animation is very simple, there's little or no character  development, and nothing important or exciting ever really seems to happen.  I *did* like the Persian look to the whole thing, and some of the music  was pleasant enough.  I'm sure Arslan will be entertaining enough for some  people, but I was pretty well bored by the end of Part One.",958089600,2,503,4.344086021505376
561215,4,6303104398,"I came across this movie by accident on the internet and boy am I glad! I really loved this movie. The story line had me glued to my seat! The charactors were well thought out and presented. Arslan the Prince who must  gather a army to free his kingdom of the religious , bloodthirsty  Lusitanians. Others are gathered together to fight to save their land some  old friends some new. The only thing that went wrong  was the name changing  and the legitimacy of his crown plot was completely disregared in the later  part of the stories. There are even websites about this movie that I found  informative. I think this is a good movie to watch in fact I think I'll  just go and watch it again!",952732800,,692,4.3515625
561216,2,6303104398,"This movie starts out awesome, and definetly resembles Record of Lodoss.  Great Story, great characters, but the ending was so disappointing that I asked for my money back.

561217,5,6303104398,Young prince must prove himself on the battlefield to win the support of his fallen countrymen. Great design (based on Persian histories) and perfect music score overlook mediocre animation. But the dialogue and  acting is better than you would expect. Ben Fairman is perfect in the lead.,948153600,,288,5.127659574468085
561218,4,6303104398,"As I read the back of the case, I started to conjure up some very strange pictures in my mind. The first was of some strange Xenogears-esque battle with some Vandal Hearts influences. The rest reminded me of my feeling when  I first heard Kid Rock's, ""Devil Without a Cause,"" which was a  very unpleasant experience. Overall, if you like old-school style anime and  huge Roman style battles, this is the catch of the sea for you.

Overall, it's well made anime. The production did a great job  on putting the original story into anime. BUT, why,why, US  Manga skipped  the last part. The real ending!

When i start a film i always watch to the end, however there was NO way i could  finish this movie.  I desperatley tried, but i failed.

When Daryoon, a young but highly skilled officer, voices his reluctance to send men into battle under these conditions, the king, unstable and enraged at the huge losses they've suffered in these battles, almost take his sword to Daryoon's throat!  Banished by the king for his ""cowardice"", Daryoon's new mission is to insure the safety of the King's only son, Prince Arislan.  Returning to the prince's palace, Daryoon and Prince Arislan stop at the cottage of the reclusive artist, Lord Narsus.  When they arrive, the half drunk Lord sits languidly drinking wine and working on an oil painting, not quite the type you'd expect to join a young prince and an ambitious soldier!  However, Prince Arislan knows that the Lord is, despite his love for wine, extremely wise, and therefore a valuable ally.  The Prince uses diplomacy and charm to convince both and the Lord Narsus and his companion, the archer Elam, to join them in their quest to somehow help the soldiers win the war.  Meanwhile, the mischievous Gieve, a traveling minstrel, encounters Pharangese, the beautiful and skilled servant of the Goddess Misra.  Pharangese's mission is to protect Prince Arislan, chosen by the Goddess Misra herself to rule the kingdom.  Gieve, mesmerized by Pharangese's beauty, resolves to join her in protecting the prince.

The character development isn't too rushed, and the plot seemed pretty good after watching both HLoA and Age of Heroes.

The king doesn't die.  I watched the offical subtitled version, and they never talk about him dying.  They say that he was captured and disappeared, but never died.

*spoiler*

In fact, they show Andragoras being tortured several times, and then he escapes with his wife by taking Giskarl captive.  He breaks free of the chains by pouring soup, sweat, and blood on the same spot of the chains for something like 6 months, which rusted the chains, allowing him to break them.",1118880000,4,758,4.562962962962963
561314,4,6303104398,"To fully understand the anime version, you gotta read original story. However, as far as I know, there is no English translation of the story; I read Japanese original, because I have Japanese proficiency. Original novel is one of my favorites, but anime isn't.

The anime version is very(and way too much) summarized version of original story(which hasn't been concluded yet; damn, it took 8 years for release of 10th volume from 9th volume), and the anime was ceased halfway of original story.

(Comment to reviewer below: Arslan's father King didn't die at the point. Fade-out doesn't always mean death of character.)

Anime itself is featured by beautiful arts and musics, but storyline is a bit perfunctory to appeal to those who haven't read original.",1109894400,5,757,5.04
561315,3,6303104398,"I remember renting this movie years ago from my local video store. I recently rented the two disc DVD set from Netflix and I am a little confused...

The first disc is as I remember it, but once I got to the second disc I only saw half what was originally released and than a longer ""episode"" that I had never seen before and did not fit in to the story thus far. According to the very first episode of ""Arlsan"" His father the king DIED in prison of an illness shortly after his talk with Silvermask / Hermes.. Yet in the last part of Arslan, he is alive and well and comes back to take back his kingdom.

I don't understand how they could make such a horrible mistake in the story. Also there is a part missing, in *I THINK* part three there is a scene where silvermask meets a Blind princess on the road, there is some sort of back sotry with them, that never gets explained... but thats not the only part where we see the princess, I CLEARLY remember at least a 5-10 minute scene that goes in to more detail with the blind princess where she meets up with Arlsan and his people. There is a whole episode missing that was VERY good that belongs between the last two episodes.. its BEFORE they changed the actors for the voice overs and BEFORE they started changing the characters names.. In fact if I remember correctly the character of Gieve( changed to gebo(sp)) left in the ""Missing"" episode to explore and get away from the rules,etc. But in the last episode on these discs he is gone, with no explaination, where we find him confronting silvermask/hermes, with no explaination and than returning to Arlsan.

I know that was confusing, but I hope it showed just what I think abiout this set, I am VERY disappointed that an entire episode is missing, one that a fan would enjoy and that was with the original voice cast and names. I am also very dissapointed that what seems to be the last epsiode in this series does not follow what every other episode in the series has told us.. you CAN NOT just revive a character that has died and have him take over the country!",1107993600,,2072,4.348837209302325

561317,5,6303104398,"The Heroic legend of Arslan was one of the best movie for me. This DVD have a really good quality(the picture,sound,special feature,and subtitle is the best). The story about young prince Arslan who want to take back his country(Pals) from Lusitania.
This story contain war,blood,betrayal,etc. It only have a little love story so for someone who like love story, this is not for you. Although this is a war story, this is not too serious.
But for me this is a splendid series, this series have a good plot, good story, beautiful picture and beautiful characters. And this series also have a good voice actors (Japanese). Please!!!Please!!! don't watch this series with dubbed voice(English), it make me crazy when I tried to watch with dubbed voice.
I'm just disappointed with one thing in this series. This series is not finished. So for you who want to see the ""Ending"" of this series you will be dissapointed too. If you want to see complete story you must buy this manga and novel (all of them in japanese language). The title of manga/comic and novel is ""Arslan Senki"" and you must buy these in internet because all of them is out of stock in japan,except novel (I bought all of this in [...]

On the downside, the print transfer is not the best quality and the final installment sees not only a change in names for the characters but an american voice cast, who while good, just don't cut it after the incredible english casts efforts in the other three films.
If it was re-dubbed, cleaned up a bit and re-released I'd buy it - otherwise stick to renting and think about buying the X TV series instead.",1050278400,2,685,4.532258064516129

A story of a gorgeous 14 year old boy & his gorgeous loyal bodyguard & his gorgeous painter & his silly survant & other gourgeous characters.
But it's not all about looks, this is a hardcore anime with a devine plot & storyline you can't pass up. I just wish the last 3 OAVs would get dubbed & the 5th redubbed.",1011744000,,439,4.176470588235294

561394,3,6303104398,"No offense to the voice over actors, but why is a lower class voice dubbing Prince Arslan.  I happen to have British relatives, and it was very distracting to hear Arslan speak with what is considered to be oa low class accent in Great Britan.  He's a prince right?  Oh well.
The animation was great and a few of the battle sequences were also nice, but there still seems to be something missing from the film.  An ending might be part of it.  But I also seemed to sense a lack of comradery.  The Lodoss War characters had a better sense of friendship.
If you like epic medieval animes, this film might be right for you.  It just wasn't for me.  I still gave it 3 stars.  It might have been 4 if it wern't for Arslan's voice.",986428800,,725,4.195652173913044
561395,4,6303104398,"The reason why the story has a Persian look to it is because it is based off of a Persian story.  Knowing this made the story even more interesting than it is presented.  Yes, the imagery is beautiful and is accurate in many ways--even with the inclusion of Zoroastrian chants.  The story seems to be based off of the persian story ""Amir Arslan"" & it is also related to the ""Shaname""/""Shanameh"" by Firdowsi/Ferdowsi.  The ""nouns"" ARE important, and the second translation would be truer to the Persian names they are related to.  Though they say ""Palsian"" during the anime what is meant is ""Persian"".  In Japanese there is that interesting relationship in how ""r's"" and ""l's"" sound.  ""Pars"" was where the name ""Persia"" came from...and in another quirk of language and pronunciation, the Arabs could not pronounce ""p's"" so the Persian language became known as Farsi instead of Parsi.  The lack of an ending is somewhat sad, but you can try to look up the source, ""Amir Arslan,"" if you can find one in your language, or even parts of the Shanameh for more information.  This is part of Persia's/Iran's historical/mythical/cultural past and it can be fascinating.  The Shanameh is a long read--9 volumes worth.  For more information on the shanameh, type ""shanameh"" or ""Firdowsi"" into a search engine....",984700800,4,1301,4.894977168949771
561396,3,6303104398,"It takes two stars out of the all result,I loved disc A but disk B did not satisfy beacause it does not end in the english languache version for all i have seen so far. Who dubbed the War of heroes so differently than the other parts ? They could at least try to make the voices sound alike to keep the sense of continuity while one is watching.

561397,5,6303104398,"The Heroic legend of Arislan is a four tape OAV (0riginal video animation) series that originally began as a seven volume novel by Yoshiki Tanaka.  His novels were loosely based off of a Persian legend and myth known as ""Amir Arislan"".  Later the story was adopted into manga form by Chisata Nakura and finally it was animated.  The four tape OAV series is well written, exciting, beautifully animated, wonderfully dubbed, and has a phenomenal sound track.
  The very first tape introduces the viewers to the background story and the imporant characters.  It all begins with the handsome knight Daryoon who is stripped of his command and banished by King Andragoras of Palse for questioning his military strategy regarding a battle against the invading forces of the Luisitanians.  Daryoon's uncle convinces him not to abandon the kingdom, but to instead to go and find the kind, intelligent, bishounen Prince Arislan and to protect him with his life.  It is Daryoon's promise that allows him to save the young prince from meeting his end on the battlefield at the hands of treachery within Palse, sorcery, and the invading Luisitanian army.  The two flee to the home of the brillant military strategist Lord Narsus and his companion Elam.  Also the goddess Misra sends high priestess Phrangese to protect prince Arislan.

The animation is simply presented (often the backgrounds are simplified or non-existant) while still beautiful. The  character design is lovely, although admittedly they lack any serious depth  -- probably because the cast is so large. The sudden decisions to change  not only the spelling of all proper nouns but all of the voice casting for  the last parts were tragic and pointless ones. The American voice cast  stinks in comparison to the British casting of earlier parts. As a classic  and enjoyable piece of anime, it's still worth having, but be wary of a  disappointing finale for the reasons above, and lack of closure.",960595200,4,735,4.926829268292683

I highly recommend this one. It is one of my favorite series. The only negative I can see is the Change in names from series to series and that the series was never fully finished.

It is visually beautiful and unlike some animes where you get this gorgeous cover art but the anime its self is not nearly as detailed, what you see it was you get. The story is also amazing, a fantasy that takes place in ancient Persia, war, political intrigue and all that fun stuff. With all that said the anime definitely has its quirks and it ends on a cliffhanger.
