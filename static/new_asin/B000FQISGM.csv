2581847,3,B000FQISGM,"I originally bought this for my son because I thought it would be great to get him in the Halloween spirit ,but it turns out that my son and niece have been watching it year around. So far its being watched at least once every month. I am  considering buying them a Christmas Sing A Long seeing how they will watch their movies out of season. This sing a long also teaches them songs that I forgot about like 10 Little Indians and teaches me the words to The Monster Mash.  Have FUN!",1282089600,,483,4.182795698924731
2581848,3,B000FQISGM,"If you like Disney Sing Along this is a fun one for Halloween. My 5 year old watches and sings along. My 8 year old watches and sings but not in front of people. He is too mature for it.
Everyone loves Disney!",1230595200,,209,3.883720930232558
2581849,4,B000FQISGM,"...have loved this sing-along video and continue to ask for it every year. Of course, I started with the VHS, but was so happy to find the DVD a couple of years ago. So, even if some reviewers find this little vid less than stimulating, over 700 elementary music students per year beg to differ.",1224892800,,295,4.381818181818182
2581850,5,B000FQISGM,"Yes this DVD is pretty cheesy and annoying from an adults point of view but my kids LOVE it!  My kids are 1, 3 & 5 and everytime we put in this movie they dance, jump and sing through the entire DVD.  When they brought it to show their cousins (2,3 &4) all six kids were moving and dancing to all the songs.  I think that the kids like that the movie is not completely animated and that the children are real as well as Mickey, Minnie, etc.  Regardless of how annoying the DVD is to adults, we do enjoy watching the kids sing, dance and giggle until they are worn out!",1224028800,10,568,4.044642857142857
2581851,5,B000FQISGM,A little scary for younger kids but still a lot of fun and entertaining for the whole family.,1212624000,,93,4.222222222222222
2581852,5,B000FQISGM,"My two and 3 year olds used to be slightly afraid of the scary trees and wicked witch in this DVD, but now they totally love both!  They'll watch this video all year long!  It's more like one continuous story than most of the other singalongs I've seen.  It takes place in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland---there's a Halloween party there.  The songs are very catchy and fun for all to sing!",1207872000,2,393,4.416666666666667
2581853,4,B000FQISGM,"Contrary to some of the negative reviews, we found this video very entertaining. Give Disney a break! There are some slighlty spooky moments to keep the little ones engaged, and the simple acting and familiar songs are perfect for kids under eight.",1183593600,,248,4.928571428571429
2581854,5,B000FQISGM,"The only thing that matters about this video is that the intended audience love it. My three-year-old grandson watches it again and again. He dances to it, sings, bounces around. He thinks it's wonderful.",1168128000,,204,5.029411764705882
2581855,4,B000FQISGM,"My boys (3 & 6) love this video & asked for it to be played over & over again. I was bored, but I bought it for them, not me, so I guess that's ok. Not too scary for little guys.",1167782400,3,178,3.3658536585365852
2581856,5,B000FQISGM,"The collection of songs and scenes in this sing along  take place inside the Haunted House at Disneyland and we are given the idea that the 3 central characters (3 kids) are inside the house.  The story line moves very well as the the 3 children discover different passages and rooms in the house and in the process become more in tune with the idea of happy haunting.  You do not see a lot of real life mickey and friends as in Disneyland Fun but you will have no doubt that this is a Disney film as they are presented in nearly every sing-along on the disc.  My 2 1/2 and 4 year old enjoys this dvd and in keeping with the ""spirit"" of Halloween ask for it on a regular basis.  I would definitly put this as a backdrop to any child or adult Halloween party.",1161907200,18,758,4.129251700680272

2581870,5,B000FQISGM,"I purchased this DVD ten years ago when my eldest daughter was a baby. She loved it, and we played it all year long. I recently started playing it again after my twins were born. They are 10 months old and already love these songs. I do not know how other reviewers find this scary...even my babies love it! We have all of the Disney Sing Alongs, and this along with Disneyland Fun and You Can Fly are their favorites.",1494892800,,418,4.2375

2581877,2,B000FQISGM,"Just my personal opinion... it's an eerie video. I got bad vibes from it and I threw it out. Lol. I think I was expecting a more friendly, ""happy"" Halloween video, which I suppose most of the songs were. ""Grim Grinning Ghosts"" was the one that totally threw me off.
Everybody is entitled to their opinion and this is just mine. What doesn't work for me may work for you, so try it out!",1474761600,,385,4.216216216216216

2581880,5,B000FQISGM,"A holiday tradition on our home for many years. Great even for very small children, except my son was a little frightened of a ghost, so I had to point out each time that it was Donald Duck when he turned around - his tail shows.

A bit corny, but fun and has catchy songs. We had it on tape but had to get DVD when tape wore out.",1455753600,,330,3.782608695652174

2581883,4,B000FQISGM,OK.  Not a favorite of the Disney Character Sing Alongs.  Get the others first.,1448064000,,79,4.571428571428571
2581884,5,B000FQISGM,This is my second copy and my kids love it. They love these old Mickey sing alongs ... a bit dated but who cares? What's important is that it liked by the target audience.,1447891200,,171,4.0588235294117645
2581885,5,B000FQISGM,Love it!,1447632000,,8,3.5
2581886,5,B000FQISGM,This is a fun DVD for your kids to get them excited for Halloween. My son (4) and daughter (1) LOVE it. It is cheesy but most videos like this are! The storyline is cute and the songs and clips from Disney films are great. I'm definitely satisfied with this purchase!,1447200000,,267,4.254901960784314

2581898,1,B000FQISGM,"I have quite a few of the sing-along videos, which I generally enjoy watching with my daughter, or at least don't mind having on in the background while I do other things.  So far this is definitely the worst of the bunch.  It's like they were actively trying to see how bad they could make this and still have gullible parents (like me) waste money on it.  My 4 yr old daughter likes it, but it is unwatchable for me.  I will be sending this one with her to grandma's house so she can still watch it but I won't have to.  Honestly horrible, from the songs to the animation, to the acting to the production value, Disney put nothing into this.  Very disappointed.",1444694400,,663,4.306451612903226

2581900,4,B000FQISGM,My three year old son is obsessed with this movie. He asks to watch it multiple times a day. It has a great mix of old cartoons with new-ish cartoons. It was made in the 90s so it definitely has that feel but I think it is great and my son does too.,1442966400,,249,3.7169811320754715
2581901,3,B000FQISGM,"Doesn't live up to the other Disney Sing Along Disneyland Fun!  That's what I was hoping for and was very disappointed.  It's cheesy and annoying.  I realize it isn't for adults, but even my 2 year old grandson isn't in to it.  He would watch The Disneyland Fun dvd over and over if I let him, but this one doesn't keep his attention.  Not enough of the characters.",1439856000,,365,4.3088235294117645
2581902,5,B000FQISGM,"Just like the VHS tapes I watched as a kid. So excited to share these now with my nephew! I think I am more excited to watch than him. Kids are so captivated by watching the actual Disney costumed characters act, rather than cartoons. It is not something you see everyday!",1434326400,,272,4.352941176470588

2581917,5,B000FQISGM,"Hard for adults to understand why kids love this smorgasbord of live acting, silly songs set to some ancient cartoons, a disjointed storyline, and the Magic Mirror of Snow White fame reciting painfully rhyming dialogue - but they do. Perhaps it is because the overall theme is that Halloween is safe and silly rather than creepy or frightening. Whoever put this together was either extremely lucky or had great insight into the mind of a child.

In fact bought this as a 'reminisce' gift for my teenage daughter who watched it endlessly on cassette when younger.",1420416000,,562,4.854166666666667
2581918,3,B000FQISGM,"Cute but not great. Maybe fun for kids to watch before going trick-or-treating, but not very Disney-y.",1419033600,,102,5.0588235294117645

2581921,3,B000FQISGM,"I guess I was expecting something different. It wasn't as good as I hoped, but my son likes it. So, I guess that's all that matters. The condition was undamaged when we received it and it was here before promised. Thank you Amazon.",1413936000,,231,4.395348837209302

2581926,5,B000FQISGM,"I have four kids and every one of them loved watching this dvd! They danced and sang with the kids and characters. The story keeps the kids engaged and wondering what is going to happen next. The music is perfect for preschool age. It even has the words for the kids to follow along (if they can read). Our favorite song is ""Five Little Pumpkins!""",1410825600,,347,4.3538461538461535

2581929,5,B000FQISGM,"This video is a hit in my house...even I watch it.  We play it over and over again all the time.

It's a great thing to have for kids who love Disney...who perhaps need a little Disney magic between visits.

Also would be a great video for a teacher at Halloween time...as it plays a few Disney songs, but a few other ""Halloween"" songs too.

And for those that wonder...the kids on this video are way less annoying than kids on other Sing-along videos.

Now I can't wait for my next trip to the Haunted Mansion :)",1391126400,,513,4.247422680412371

2581934,5,B000FQISGM,"We originally came across this show last year online, but they no longer had it up. My two kids, 6 and 3, cannot get enough of watching this.

Did not have any problems with the seller.",1381881600,,362,4.338235294117647
2581935,1,B000FQISGM,"What is this?  Awful versions of Disney songs (plus some original compositions) sung inside what is supposed to be Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.  The weakest Sing Along Songs production, by far.  My six-year-old could barely sit through two songs.",1379635200,,247,5.447368421052632
2581936,5,B000FQISGM,My children enjoyed this VHS when they were young.  I saw it on DVD and got it for them and you would have enjoyed seeing my now 26 and 22 year old kids singing along and laughing hysterically!,1372982400,10,193,4.078947368421052

2581955,5,B000FQISGM,"Now, I might be biased, because I LOVE Halloween, but most of the other Sing-a-long DVDs I can't stand.  Most of them are annoying (I really hate the camp one).  But I LOVE this one...the villains, the clips from old Mickey cartoons, the songs, the haunted mansion.  It's really magical.  The ending with the choreographed dance to Monster Mash is great...SO fun.
Last fall I baby-sat my 2 year old nephew full-time and we would watch this a few times a week.  Highly recommend!",1360886400,,478,4.642857142857143

This video was simply disappointing because it had fewer children singing, less entertaining songs, and more animated parts.",1355875200,2,326,5.269230769230769
2581958,3,B000FQISGM,I bought this for my 5 year old because she has the Disneyland Sing a long and really likes it but it was a little young for her. It is cute though- would recommend it for 2-4 yr olds.,1354320000,,184,3.7435897435897436

However, when I compared the two DVD's side by side they are definitely of different quality. The picture on the Disc is not the same and no where near as detailed as the original DVD I was replacing. Makes me wonder after some of the other reviews I had read.
