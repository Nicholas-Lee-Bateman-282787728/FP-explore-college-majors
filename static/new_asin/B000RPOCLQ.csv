8202296,4,B000RPOCLQ,This really was touching and charming.  I've worked with autistic children in the past and Eddy didn't pass so much as being autistic as mentally handicapped.  But it's a good warm-hearted movie----not entirely believable---but who cares.  Sometimes it's nice to get out of this dirty world and just enjoy some warm-hearted entertainment.,1505952000,,338,5.461538461538462

8202298,5,B000RPOCLQ,"This film is based on a true story, of an autistic man who wanted to ""be somebody,"" and ""be important.""  He thought that meant hearing your name chanted by thousands of adoring fans, like his NBA basketball star friend experienced.  In the end, he finds his importance--and his fans--at the local animal shelter.  This is a very heartwarming story for the whole family, and displays the values of friendship and compassion.",1231459200,,423,4.929577464788732
8202299,5,B000RPOCLQ,"With a great cast starring Brian Presley as the mentally ill, autistic and lovable Eddy Patterson; Lee Garlington as his mother torn between an abusive marriage and loving her son; Kiki Ellsworth as Mike Jeffreys as a former pro basketball player with an injured knee and community service at a Los Angeles homeless shelter. Scott McKinsey who is the director behind this film deserves a lot of credit bringing this story to life. Scott is a veteran soap opera director which might not mean much to the people in the industry. This film might have been low budget but has a lot of heart and is worthy to watch again and again. My only complaint is that Scott's mother, Beverlee, wasn't in it. I would have surely loved to see her in anything and now that she's gone. I wished she had done more. I can't forget Amen's Anna Maria Horsford who plays the director of the homeless shelter, Carol.",1218844800,3,891,4.575
8202300,5,B000RPOCLQ,I really loved this movie.  It made me cry and was very heart warming.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.  Rated PG.,1202688000,,124,4.304347826086956
