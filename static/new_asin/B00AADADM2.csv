5404121,3,B00AADADM2,"When an energy experiment goes haywire, massive hurricanes rip across America. A high school science teacher must get his family to safety before the hurricanes merge, creating a ""hypercane"" with the power to wipe the America off the map.

After Super Cyclone, I was really hesitant to buy any Asylum movie about storms and the like. Super Cyclone, in my opinion, was literally the worst Asylum movie that I've ever watched. Thankfully, I viewed 40 Days & Nights. Because of that movie, I decided to take a chance on 500 MPH Storm. It's good that I did because 500 MPH Storm turned out to be a decent movie. not quite up to the standards of 40 Days & Nights but dang near close. Nevertheless, it was an entertaining movie that kept me interested(in that B-movie sort of way). I'll admit, however, that the movie does have it's moments where I felt like getting up and switching the DVD player off.

As for how I'd rate this item, It was okay for an Asylum movie. Thank goodness that I've seen Casper Van Dien play in alot of other B-movies. That's why I stuck with it.",1363651200,9,1068,4.5
5404122,1,B00AADADM2,"If you think you know bad........... You haven't seen this yet! Extremely poor plot, even worse acting, seriously pathetic special effects, and 90% of the movie is special effects!!!! The same building is portrayed as 10 different facilities. The suposedly heroic family is always screaming in fear and they never make a remotely intelligent decision in any circumstance. Did I mention seriously pathetic special effects and 90% of the movie is special effects??? Their special effects look like they were designed on an Etch-A-Sketch!!!!!! On a scale of 1 to 10, this ranks about 126,792,537 below zero!!!!!!!! A candidate for a Rotten Tomatoes award? No, I would say it's more of a candidate for a fresh cow pie!!!!!",1363392000,5,718,5.093220338983051
5404123,1,B00AADADM2,"My wife loves Disaster movies... This is a total disaster and not in a good way. The acting sucks, the story line... well it was like there was no script and actors made it up as they went along. I knew it was going to be a low budget film, but when nothing makes sense and the lack of a story line as it jumps to places where your thinking ... Did I miss something for them to get to this point?? We want some of the 70's disaster films like Posiden or the Airport movies. - Towering Inferno - ect.

5404124,1,B00AADADM2,"Ah, Cas Van Dien in yet another low budget Sci Fi extravaganza.  He's got to put food on the table I suppose right?

I am a huge fan of dumb low budget weather related Sci Fi flicks and this one is pretty dumb.  Bad, bad acting, terrible, no wait...AWFUL script and a snot nosed teenaged kid who needs to be smacked upside the head for his snarky attitude towards his parents.
Early in the film, Van Dien, driving away from the storm after ballooning, contorts his face into what's supposed to be fearful looks, but shows up only as bad acting.  I laughed.  LOVE the rugged look he has though.  The beard looks great and I'm not a fan of facial hair.

The thing that bugged me about this the most, was small odd scenes that were shot, and then all tossed around and edited together like a bunch of high school kids were working on a film project in their cinema class.  You knew which scenes were staged so the actors would stand and stare at the CGI to be inserted later.  Lol

The super storm threatens Van Dien and his on screen family, so they decide to head to higher ground in the family car (Approx 21 mins into the movie).  Once there, the snarky son gets out of the car complaining and kicking up dirt, until the mom say's ""John, be quiet"".
Then, dad say's ""I hear it too"". Then, they all scramble, per verbal instruction, to get into the car ""slowly"" then ""faster"" without the film EVER explaining WHAT the stupid scary sound was.  lol....  Bigfoot perhaps? Mountain Lions? Zombies? Vampires?  Wait, it's daylight so no it couldn't be vamps...(Eh, unless it's a glittery Cullen}.
The entire scene is about 20 seconds long and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  You're left scratchin' your head at that one.

The rest of the movie is filled with more cheap CGI and bad acting.  That's about it.",1362096000,34,1807,4.460365853658536

The movie is just shi-tty from the poster!!! It's not even a B level movie! The plot was all messed up and very confusing!!! Also, cheap made.

5404202,2,B00AADADM2,"Sometimes I wonder how someone can write something so awful and convince someone to bankroll its production. In the world of bad science fiction movies, then one is spectacularly horrible. As is the norm for bad sci-fi, the scientific explanations are basically a tinfoil-wearing weirdo's pseudoscientific conspiracy theories on steroids. My reaction to the ""science"" in the movie was like the commercial where the woman says, ""That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works."" It feels like the writer was dropping acid or something while watch The Weather Channel when they came up with the idea for this movie. Even the dialogue between the pseudoscience is awful. The characters are all unsympathetic and I'm pretty sure that Nathan refusing to let the dog come with them (because it had a bad owner) borders on the sociopathic. And how does a brilliant scientist always forget to take his keys out of the ignition? That doesn't make sense. Another thing that makes no sense: with all of the destruction, how are their cell phones working so well? I've lived in an area regularly hit by severe weather and cell service gets bad quickly when disastrous weather is going on.

There isn't anything exciting about this. There isn't anything that builds suspense or leaves you anticipating anything but boredom and bad science. The acting isn't awful, but it's not good. It seems more likely that the cast signed on because they needed the money than for any creative reason.

The coloring is a bit off. Even in clear sky scenes, there's an excessive shadowed look. It makes the movie look especially cheap. That effect also isn't really easy on the eyes. Contrast and brightness alterations would have been extremely helpful.",1440374400,,1735,4.958762886597938

5404219,3,B00AADADM2,The really bad reviews I read here are pretty extreme. Yes it was ridiculous that they kept outrunning the storm but the story had normal continuity and the editing was fine enough. The acting was normal bad not awful. I think the writing was under par as far as the wife and kid go. They kept driving me crazy every time they said hurry and faster. The computer effects were present a lot but like I said I think the editing lacked in utilizing them the best way. It was exciting like any other low budget disaster film. The music and build up kept me on edge and the adrenaline flowing. Lots of low budget Syfy flicks don't. It wasn't great but it wasn't near as bad as the bad reviews I read here.,1434153600,,700,4.231343283582089
5404220,5,B00AADADM2,"You're a semi-world famous movie company that makes crazy movies only a true BAD-cinema aficionado can appreciate.

They even miraculously resurrected Tara Reid career as an actress! Sharknado 1-3 anyone? Oh wait, or was that a bad thing?

Anyway, picture them all sitting around a huge table covered in beer cans, bongs, and draino bottles. They're brainstorming movie ideas but they hit a major writers block.

Then from the back of the room out of the shadows an intern meekly whispers , ""Who don't you just out-Asylum the Asylum? In other words take all of the past bad ideas even you wouldn't use, then randomly throw them all together to make one movie.

**SPOILER ALERT**
And Casper van Dien, who else right? Have him drive around the entire movie looking like a maniac, yelling ""I'm going as fast as I can!"" and, ""We need to get to higher elevation!"" while a Tornado literally follows them around, then have a Tsunami chase them. Yeah yeah. Also constantly change the background scenery, so the weather (sunny, rainy, apocolypsy ) and his location (city, desert, mountains) constantly swaps around throughout, sometimes all of them within a 30 second period. Then do that over and over.

Oh, and for eye candy. Yeah, Sarah Lieving right. Nice plump rump and she didn't stink up the other 10 Asylum ""movies"" she's been in. Oh, and also have an anonymous leggy blonde tech walk around in the background of the control center whenever possible to distract people from the inane dialogue. Finally, give Casper a whiny son we can all soon root for getting sucked up into the storm, along with Sarah's clothing.

Next have Casper suggest a crazy last minute solution, then have him and his family ""triangulate"" something for 10 filler minutes, then have them coincidentally also be close enough to the source of the disaster, which is way out in the ocean, so they can all fly out there in a helicopter and shoot a missile at it for one last world saving kaboom.

After the intern was done talking everyone staggered to their feet and applauded. She was instantly promoted to CEO and the movie was completed in just 2 days. Success!

Now sit back and stare in awe of the Asylum and what they have wrought...",1433030400,,2209,4.734375
5404221,5,B00AADADM2,"Who did Casper have to blow to get a job as an actor anyway?

WOW. Yes, I agree with the most helpful reviewers, this is a classic. Rent it, buy it, whatever you have to because you definitely have to see it to believe it. Did those looneys at the Asylum actually think they could pass this off as a movie or are they just pulling our leg? It is more like a big mess of jumbled up video clips, half of which make no sense at all. Unbelievable lol, this is a laugh riot! Just count the number of times they show as other viewers said, scenes where it is ""raining"" (some dork standing on a ladder with a garden hose sprinkling water down in front of camera) but the actors or the car are behind the rain in a sunny blue sky setting where the car and the road are not even wet. If you are playing the drinking game you will probably lose count after about 150 times, lol. Or the number of times Casper is gritting his teeth in that dumb expression like he wants to show off his freshly bleached teeth but looks like he is struggling to pinch a loaf! And talk about LOW budget OMIGOD, if they paid him more than $1,000 for his performance they wasted the money that obviously should have been spent on the special effects instead. Like I said, you've got to see this to believe it, this one's a real keeper and a barrel of laughs!

5404235,2,B00AADADM2,"A lot of critics have lambasted this movie, and I thought for sure they were being overly critical. But they're not. This movie has a ton of really stupid moments, and this is coming from someone who typically likes Casper Van Dien's low budget action movies. I think the problem is not the story, but the poor special effects and direction. It's obvious the actors were directed to react to special effects that would later be created in the studio, but there are a lot of scenes where the two don't mesh. That means you'll have Casper driving frantically to escape a storm..but you see a bright sunny sky out the back of the car.",1429056000,,631,4.495652173913044

5404243,3,B00AADADM2,"Hot air balloons on a collusion course fill the sky, meanwhile there's an infusion reactor thingy going haywire because some dopey scientists thought to invent a means of making energy.  Something immediately goes wrong, and an instant storm develops.  Chaos.  Everyone run screaming.........................!  Abandon balloons and all hope, it's another weather disaster flick starring Casper Van Dien.  In this particular offering, Casper must protect his family and the planet from a colossal doohickey he had some small part in creating.  To that end, he drives and drives and drives, when he isn't running and running and running to escape the terror unleashed!  In the interim, at the site of the hubbub, two guys argue over how to correct their enormous blunder.  They haven't a clue.  It doesn't appear that anyone does.  But at least our heroes, the plucky family of three, had enough sense to head for higher ground, for all the good it did them.
Considering all the driving and the time spent in vehicles, you could easily classify this as a road picture.  With incredibly bad weather.  No matter where they go the storm follows, and inexplicably, so does a lot of sunshine.

Depending on your sense of humor, this crap-fest of a sci-fi disaster flick could be considered quite diverting.  Or it could just land like a giant thud in your brain, a complete misfire.  It is a bit overwrought in its presentation.  Everyone `acts' with such a heightened sense of urgency, frantic to produce a display of forced dread, that none of the performances feel genuine.  It doesn't help that Casper is constantly pausing to pose for the camera, hair wind blown, looking worried and distressed.

This movie was BAD!!  The script was bad and the acting was worse.  I read another person review which said they couldn't even remember the  names of the characters half way through the movie,, and I realized I couldn't remember most of them either.
Michael Beach was good and those around him weren't too bad.  The wife and the son though, the movie would have been better off if they'd fallen out of the balloon in the beginning.  Casper Van Dien was tolerable as long as he wasn't around his family; however, put the three of them together and it was as if bad acting tripled exponentially.

A nuclear reactor somehow gathers natural energy from the earth, you know wind, magnetic, and that plate shifting stuff and channels a beam of light into the atmosphere to create power so we can shut down all the oil rigs. (Message: Renewables bad. Oil good.) Nathan (Casper Van Dien) a man we know less about than the science I just fully explained, is an expect on this reactor and storms too. He is out with his family, which for some strange reason did NOT include Catherine Oxenberg. They are flying a hot air balloon, which makes for great film footage with a 500 MPH hurricane (BFH) headed you way.  Can you say Oz Fest?

Sarah Lieving plays the remarkably calm wife, apparently facing death is easier than living with Casper Van Dien. Her lines while facing death include:

""Just calm down and play your game or something.""
""Honey, There is no Internet.""  and
""I'll make sandwiches.""

In this film they can't shut the reactor down because they had a ""core meltdown.""  The script writer must have moved the year they taught science in school. I am not sure what film the DVD cover is from.

Nathan tries to save his family by out running and out maneuvering a BFH by darting around like a jack rabbit, making John Cusack's ""2012"" driving look like child's play.  Don't try this at home.  Ultimately his driving ability climaxes when he drives inside the tail end of a semi as it is skidding down the highway and then being thrown out the same end doing donuts, then finally moving forward outrunning said storm. I'm not sure how many laws of motion were violated in that one.

5404372,1,B00AADADM2,"There are epic natural disaster movies, and there are horrible natural disaster movies. '500 MPH Storm' creates its own new niche category: Epically Horrible Natural Disaster Movies. I may yet be proven mistaken, but I expect it will be some time before anything knocks THAT buzzard off it's dung heap...

From the unbelievably lame 'scientific' premise and terminology, to the constant and instant changes from broad daylight to blasting dark storm scene cuts, there is NOTHING even remotely realistic about this movie. I hope none of the cast members ever watch it themselves or I'm afraid they'd commit hare-kare from the shame and humiliation.

The most glaring thing is the development of a RAGING tornado out of an overcast that was clear blue sky seconds ago, back to clear blue sky just as quickly... again and again. A tornado that follows the main cast's SUV, and tracks every curve in the road with them is the most remarkable case of 'sheer coincidence' and 'against all odds' you could ever come up with. When the car is driving, and the outside forward tracking shots show idyllic weather, but the inside shot shows near-blackness through the back window... again and again... it becomes an arduous task to keep watching.  Painful in the extreme. When the same factory/warehouse location is fed to you several times as a 'different place', your eyes start to roll back in your head.  After a MASSIVE inundation of water swamps the building and everything in it, but the ground is dry when they immediately go back outside, you have to wonder what the directors were smoking.

A Supercane doesn't even require windshield wipers.

A 'traffic accident' where a car and a pickup (with their front clips obviously carefully removed for resale) is staged on a remote highway. Although intended to be a severe collision, there is not one wrinkle on either vehicle... and how could there be because all the bodywork that should have been involved was most likely now installed on different vehicles! The steering column was even removed from the car. That was THEE lamest excuse for a car accident I have ever seen. Also, no bodies or injured people. Only an inbred redneck pervert intent on raping the first housewife who shows up, no matter how many able-bodied males are in the immediate vicinity or how intense the storm that is swirling around and about.

""These exact co-ordinates"" is a term you will become nauseated from hearing, as they bend light and magically abolish extreme weather systems that several nuclear bombs couldn't disrupt.

A kid, never having been at a remote location before, just instinctively knows where there happens to be a helicopter; fueled up and ready to go... a long piece through a burning forest, across a wide stream and into another stand of trees. That same helicopter also happens to be the most chameleon-like flying machine ever developed, because it changes its paint scheme and configuration multiple times.

I have no spoiler to give away; after torturously forcing myself to keep watching--and always to my regret--I finally gave up with still 20 laborious minutes to go. I just didn't have the stomach or the patience for one single more sudden life-threatening situation to descend upon the cast, literally out of the blue, and have to see the grimaces of rat poison constipation distort their faces any longer.",1381708800,4,3368,4.957446808510638

5404377,2,B00AADADM2,"For movies titled"" GatorBear,"" ""True UFO Tales,"" or ""500 mph Storm,""  (I made the first two up in case you were wondering) I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances.  I usually end up being pleasantly surprised at the effort put forth by the actors.  I mean, they are getting paid and having fun, right?  But in 500 mph Storm, the bad acting by the trio of protagonists led by the scientist (Caspar Van Diem) is taken to a whole new level of bad.  Maybe they were forced to do this movie through blackmail, or as a probation requirement.  They were not having fun at all, and the horrible script did not help.  Actually, I ended up laughing at totally random things that happened in the film.  There is one scene where this young blond thing walks by and says very seductively that the something is at ""full capacity.""  At that point I started seeing this movie as an unintentional comedy.

The family that is escaping from the storm is the stupidest trio you have ever met.  The son is an idiot, the wife is an airhead, and the dad is supposedly a brilliant scientist, but he makes the worst decision early in the movie, and that is to leave a sweet helpless, dog to meet it's death in the road!  Now the viewer hates you, good move.  From that point, when a tornado was chasing them, I cheered for the tornado.

The CGI effects, the sound, the wardrobe, sets, cinematography is all very good.  But it doesn't matter.  Poor dog.",1370044800,2,1428,4.476744186046512

Take a shot or chug a beer after any of these below.  You might want to pick just one.  Even then you may die of alcohol poisoning, so play at your own risk.

1.  Someone runs in slow motion.
2.  Casper Van Dien yells ""Come On!!! Let's go!!!""
3.  Casper Van Dien has a look of fear that instead resembles constipation
4.  Casper Van Dien outruns Mother Nature...on foot!
5.  You have no idea what is going on or why.
6.  You see a main cast member after a half hour or so in, and you can't remember their name, and are not entirely sure if the movie ever told you.
7.  You see the same location being passed off as a different location
8.  You see a special effect that you could put together in the next ten minutes
9.  Every time Casper Van Dien and his family get out of the car, then almost immediately get back into it.
10. The family car is careening through the driving rain, and the windshield wipers aren't on.
