What is sad is this story is so focused on Almanzos sister, it should be called Almanzos sisters sacrafice.  It also is far from the actual historical events in Laura Ingalls Wilders life.  I found that the story was very much writen as Landon wanted it to go.  Not as how it should have gone from history. I found it disappointing with the Wedding scene almost non-existant and poorly done. The story was enjoyable most of the times however and only would recommend if you're familiar with the series on tv. If not I would say pass.",1039478400,5,642,4.369747899159663

7852227,5,6303625819,"Even though I was too young too remember when Little House was originally on the air, I started watching the reruns a few years ago. I was hooked from the very beginning. Melissa Gilbert is one of my favorite actresses if  not my favorite. I love the work she did on Little House and that's why  this episode is one of my very favorites. She and Dean  Butler(Almanzo)really shine through. I watch this episode whenever it comes  on TV and then I can't wait till it comes on again. If you are thinking of  purchasing an episode of Little House on the Prairie, I strongly recommend  this one.",960163200,12,590,4.416666666666667
