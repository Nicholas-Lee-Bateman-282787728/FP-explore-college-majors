3141225,4,B00158K0V0,"I managed to view a copy of this movie that was leaked to the internet today. This is the second Futurama direct-to-DVD movie to come out as part of the series' semi-revival after being canceled by the executive morons at Fox a couple of years back. Now I'm a big Futurama fan so I'm probably biased but I enjoyed this movie. The first direct-to-DVD movie was probably a bit better as it had a more diverse storyline and musical numbers but this one was thoroughly entertaining and I highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the series.

The best thing about this movie is the use of secondary characters. Futurama developed a ridiculously expansive cast during the course of its original 4 year run and the creators are now (wisely in my opinion) expanding beyond focusing on the Planet Express crew. The use of the many robot characters in this one was great, especially Calculon, Millionairebot, Hedonismbot, a large heavily armored robot (whose name I can't remember), and of course the robot devil, who is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Aside from the bots, we also see the return of President Richard Nixon's head, who delivers one of the funniest lines in the movie.

The worst thing about this film may be that fact that the guest voices are underused. Brittany Murphy's performance as a new romantic interest for Fry is well done but ultimately forgettable. Steven Hawking plays himself and while he makes a nice addition with some genuinely funny lines, he's often hard to understand. Also, David Cross plays the role of the giant tentacle monster who is the focus of much of the movie. While he is given some good awkward material to work with, he is never given a chance to shine like he did in Arrested Development. Even so, this is a minor gripe.

The bottom line: This is another cleverly written and enjoyable entry to the series. The lack of musical numbers was a bit of a let down but I liked the movie and I'll be buying it as soon as it's available in stores.",1212883200,8,1980,4.603399433427762
3141226,4,B00158K0V0,"The second of the straight to DVD Futurama movies, ""Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs"" has arrived and it comes loaded with laughs.
  Picking up shortly after the end of the previous film, ""Bender's Big Score"", the people of our universe are in fear of what the new inter-dimensional rift will mean to them and there are those that predict an end to everything is coming soon.
  Back at the Planetary Express Office, life is pretty much as it always is with one exception, Fry (Billy West), has a new girlfriend named Colleen (Brittany Murphy), and is doing well in his new relationship.
  Amy (Lauren Tom) and Kip are also doing well in their relationship and buoyed by the success Fry is having decide to conduct a marriage like ceremony on Kip's swamp filled home planet.
  Soon after, a delegation of leaders from around the cosmos gather to listen to the head of (Steven Hawking) discuss options on how to deal with the latest threat from the universe. Naturally nobody can agree and when Professor Farnsworth (Billy West) runs afoul of his nemesis Doctor Wernstrom they decide to settle their dispute in a hilarious live action version of title ball. Of course the fact that their debate stems from which of their crews is best suited to get slaughtered by exploring the rift is of little consequence.
  Once settled the crew of the Planetary Express under the command of Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal), shifts into high gear as their interpersonal relationships and quirks all come into play, often at the worst time which further complicates a bad situation.
  While this is going on, Bender (John Di Maggio), becomes infatuated with television personality Calculon, and starts down a path that will lead him to becoming part of a secret robotic society whose stated goal is death to all humans.
  As events unfold, an entity known as Yivo (David Cross), who inhabits the dimension on the other side of the rift, starts to control all of the people of our universe which places Fry in a Pope like position as he and the people start to discover the real reason Yivo is interested in our Universe.
  Along the way, there are numerous subplots and some truly classic lines from Zap Brannigan and others as the fate of two universes will soon depend on the actions of the highly dysfunctional characters of the story.
  While some may say the plot of this new Futurama does not grab you the way past episodes did, it does have plenty of humor; much of it comes in scenarios outside the main story arch and allows for some very nostalgic looks book at some of the classic moments from the series. I do not want to spoil any of the surprises, but let's say that the phrase Snu Snu comes back as does some of Bender's past.
  Since this is the second of four planned DVDs, it is clear that the new offering is laying ground work for the next two films as it does not wrap things up in a tidy bow when finished. Instead it provides plenty of laughs and great moments of nostalgia for fans of the series and loads of extras which include deleted scenes, commentaries, and a look at the next film ""Bender's Game"".
All in all a welcome and satisfying film that should delight fans and help keep us happy until the new film arrives in time for the Holidays.

3141278,3,B00158K0V0,"A lot of reviewers found this film inferior to Bender's Big Score, I found that it had its merits and put it at about par with that film. To me, Bender's Big Score was a bit too emotional, and in strange narwhal-ish ways; this film is more aloof, with Fry showing off his new girlfriend Colleen to the Planet Express crew, including Leela. It starts out with cool, goofy historical animation segments (we get a whole episode dedicated to this in Season 6, Reanimation). Colleen's five boyfriends are funny, as is Amy's sexy funeral dress (!?!). Great lines like ""mutilation is never easy,"" ""you're the only universe in the world"", ""there is no love without great jealousy"", and the question to one-eyed Leela ""were you winking or blinking?"" Love the basketball planet too!

The bonus features are quite expansive, with a full segment from the Futurama video game, showing the 3-D animated storyline bits that come between game play, augmented with commentary and better sound effects. ""Farewell big blue ball of idiots!"" The chicken walker! Great Mom lines like ""we'll just have to hunt them down like common kittens"" and ""try harder, you son-of-a-me!"" There's a Farnsworth head, and giant robots - ""and so I die the way I lived - as a giant robot."" Fry's offscreen gun shot as he robs a pawn shop! From the commentary we find out that there was a strange Farnsworth university section that involved no real action that was never created in the end.

We also get a very long animatic (21:38) for people who like that sort of thing, and there are also several deleted scenes: the awesome ""original opening storyboard"" (0:34), where the narrator becomes a character who is hunted down by Bender, ""Fry and Colleen meeting"" (0:34), ""St Asimov Parade storyboard"" (0:20) that's pretty funny, ""Zapp and Scientists"" (0:46) that's pretty similar to what appeared in the movie anyway, ""Amy, Fry and Leela Storyboard"" (0:28), ""Scruffy the Janitor layout automatic"" (0:28) that has to be seen to be believed (Leela, how could you!?!). Then there's a David Cross meets Yivo mini-documentary (2:00) that's kind of silly/irrelevant/waste of time. ""Blooperama: the Futurama cast at 'work'"" (2:12) is pretty goofy and it's just what you'd think - four men and two women in a sound studio. There's a ""3D Models Animators' discussion"" (4:11) where we get into the technical aspects of the Diamondillium-armoured Earth scene, a space ship take-off, M5438, Kiff's mom/bug cloud/swarm, Bender's pirate ship, busy space vehicles, the wooden ship, and the anomaly and tentacles. Finally, in ""A Brief History of Deathball"" we find out how the costumes and maze layout were designed.

The title cards for the menus and sub-menus are good fun too, with campy comic book/horror film references like ""In glorious Grope-a-scope""!",1433116800,,2799,5.01505376344086

3141396,4,B00158K0V0,"Ah, Futurama. How we missed you. When Futurama was cancelled, everyone died a little on the inside. When they announced it would return, everyone cheered. When they announced that first would come several made-for-DVD movies...well, let's just say us fans were apprehensive.

The success of Bender's Big Score changed that. Seeing that a Futurama movie could not only live up to the quality of the show-but even possibly surpass it-was, as the Professor would say, wonderful news. Beast with a Billion Backs instantly rose to the top of my most anticipated lists for this summer, and I have to say it delivered.

Unlike Big Score, Billion Backs is more new material and less reliance on nostalgia. Where Big Score got their laughs from bringing back characters and tying together refrences in zany ways, Billion Backs has little to do with the show itself. The story takes place directly after Big Score, after the rift in the universe tears space asunder. The earth is panicking, and scientists are gathered to find a solution. After much debate (and Death Ball), the Planet Express crew is sent to man an expedition to the rift when they discover that nothing mechanical can pass through.

Hurt, Bender returns home and sulks while humanity and the other organic lifeforms plan ways to destroy whatever universe lies on the other side. During his sulking, Bender meets up with the League of Robots, an all-robot group originally designed to destroy humanity, but which has since lots its purpose.

Meanwhile, Fry stows away on a military spaceship (bet you can guess who the captain in charge of the mission is!) and flings himself into the other universe, trying to escape from it all. What Fry ends up finding (and bringing back with him) will forever change the course of our galaxy's history.

CONTENT: 4/5

The story in Beast with a Billion Backs isn't the greatest we've ever seen from the series, but it definitely belongs with the other strong episodes and Big Score. The interaction between the various characters goes to a level deeper than the show did, and we see new aspects of people we thought we already fully understood.

David Cross provides the voice for the titular beast, and does an amazing job making it one of the more memorable cameos in the history of Futurama. If you're a fan of the series, this is definitely a must-watch story arc which is sure to bring a smile to your face with the witty writing we're so used too.

VIDEO: 3.5/5

The movie's animation is about par with the series, but nothing about it really blows you away any more than the episodes on DVD or Big Score. Colors and the design of some of the elements is nice, but I feel like BwaBB takes less chances with the art direction than past Futurama works, and relies heavily instead on the earth and other familiar locales. The only truly new and original locale (which you'll see near the end of the movie) isn't exactly original in its design.

For you videophiles, though, the transfer is nice and smooth with no noticeable fading, is in native widescreen, and although there are a few grainy moments overall the blacks stay dark and consistent.

AUDIO: 4/5

The audio might not be as technically impressive as other movies, but the voice acting remains superb, and shows why Futurama was one of the most popular (and most respected) cartoons of all time. David Cross's work in this is tremendous, and only makes me want to have him become a regular contributor to the show once it's back on the air. Toss in 11 cast commentary tracks, and you're all set.

REPLAY: 5/5

Like the show, the replay value for Beast with a Billion Backs is off the charts for those who enjoy the show. Jokes remain funny and stand up well to repeated viewings.

EXTRAS: 4.5/5

You have to hand it to the Futurama crew, because they certainly know how to stock their products. Other than the aforementioned 11+ commentary tracks, Beast with a Billion Backs features deleted scenes, a short piece on David Cross's participation, a history of Deathball, a look at the next Futurama movie (the fantasy-based Bender's Game), and best of all, the entire 30 minute episode one could have watched by playing through the Futurama videogame. I never enjoyed the game enough to play through to view the story, but now you can watch it in its sorta-3D goodness uninterrupted.

Beast with a Billion Backs isn't the best thing Futurama has ever produced, but it's certainly not in the bottom half. It's a very solid production for fans used to the show, and is a must-own for any fans.",1249689600,,4563,4.73989898989899

3141399,5,B00158K0V0,"After seeing Bender's Big Score (which I didn't hate), I was a little worried about this new Futurama movie. As it turns out, however, if you don't mind the concept of essentially being mated with by a giant multi-armed monster the size of a planet who sticks his ""genticles"" (yes, it is a combination of two words and is as bad as it sounds), then this movie is fun. If that aspect of the plot is too weird, there's a really fun side plot with Bender and the other robots. Yes, it comes into play toward the end of the movie, but other than that is completely unrelated (classic futurama). The deleted scenes are great too, including the alternate opening.",1242864000,,657,4.483333333333333
3141400,2,B00158K0V0,"A viewer wrote ""some Futurama is better than no Futurama."" I dissent.
I own the entire series (after having been a faithful fan of the series). And a couple of episodes were genuine heartbreakers, but most were excellent. Some were just funny and that's the worst I intend to say about the series. But it _always_ had heart. That was the secret ingredient to Futurama's success: we ""felt"" for the characters, despite their obvious flaws--or perhaps because of them! Despite their dysfunction they never lost their humanity or their ability to acknowledge their flaws. And at episode's end they each had made some peace with those flaws. The characters _chose_ their outcomes and conclusions.
That said, ""Beast"" broke its boundaries! It does not equal ""Bender's Big Score"" which gave closure to a couple of the more unsettling (yes, the _heart-breaking_ ones; I'll never hear Connie Francis's ""If it takes forever"" the same way again; thank you, very much...) episodes.
Hey, guys, much as I love the series, ""Beast"" _destroys_ the spirit of the entire series. Be forewarned. ""Beast's"" plot is despicable and perverse; Bender evolves from his arrogant, dishonest self to a shallow, narcissistic and mean-spirited jealous sociopath who holds human choice in contempt.
Perhaps this film was meant to strike a blow for nihilists and cynics the universe over, but did it have to do it in such an angry manner (in a strange way, its ending reminded me of a humorous ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" the Jeff Goldblum/Donald Sutherland version)?
Can't say I admired the spirit behind ""Beast."" ""Beast"" is heartless. Futurama is a success. Has this success destroyed its writers' inner beauty and ability to have fun?
Conversely, I have to admit that ""Beast"" makes its point (in its warped way) about the _eternal_ conflict in the human soul between the human yearning for a loving, nurturing utopia (back to the womb?) and the endless struggle that life is. For we define ourselves as humans and individuals--and existence itself--by this struggle, by how we learn to deal with this daily struggle and, to a degree, how we ""control"" the outcome.
Life is, after all, a cosmic game. Do we ""win"" by cooperating with each other or by competing with each other to death? It's about human choice, whether you believe in ""free will"" or not. Bender, a robot--a man-made tool--I sensed, subverted the process-OR did he perpetuate it? Is the mean-spirited _destruction_ of the choices of others our _true human destiny_?
Rent this one. And be careful. It's point and viewpoint may make you cringe. 2 and half to 3 stars, max.",1240531200,2,2607,4.981651376146789

3141427,3,B00158K0V0,"I was already unhappy with the first Futurama movie, so I didn't have much hope for the second.  I was surprised to see that this installment of Futurama is actually two awkward subplots mashed together: Lovecraftian horror for the first half, and a meditation on religion on the second half.

On the Lovecraftian side, throw in tentacle attacks, slimy ancient gods from beyond time and space, and the nihilistic view that Heaven is a fabrication and you've got a pretty depressing, semi-creepy, not really all that funny first half.  Bender finally makes good on his threat to destroy all humans, Fry conveniently forgets his entire relationship with Leela, the Robot Devil shows up for a one-note gag ... I could go on but I'll stop there.

Judging by the reviews so far, the second half went over a lot of peoples' heads.  Yivo is a parody of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is itself a parody of religion.  Basically, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a mental construct posed to challenge the notion of a divine being; if you can disprove that the Spaghetti Monster was responsible you win the argument. ""Win"" being a pretty subjective word, as anyone knows who has argued about religion or politics.

As one big joke about relationships and religion, Beast With a Billion Backs works pretty well.  But for reasons known only to the writers, the plot shambles forward well beyond the Big Revelation by Leela about Yivo, the aforementioned Spaghetti Monster. It's like the drunk guy at a party who tells a joke, discovers no one thinks it's funny, then tells it in a slightly different way that STILL doesn't make it funny.  We get it: relationships with people can be just as ridiculous as relationships with God.  But this is Futurama, and while I appreciate the depth of meaning the show strives for with this movie, it feels forced.  A multitude of guest appearances doesn't make up for it.

Still, I can't be too harsh on Futurama.  You won't find many animated shows that are willing to take on topics like relationships and religion at the same time, so Futurama gets points for trying.  I just wish it didn't try so hard.",1228262400,4,2135,4.750677506775068

Of the three, I loved BBS the best. There were a lot of funny jokes and I love how they complexly interwove time travel into the movie. When you watch with the commentary on, you learn of all the thought that went behind this movie (e.g. numbers in the background, how they came up with equations, etc.) which they didn't do in the subsequent two movies. Couldn't watch the whole Hypnotoad episode. Zzzzzz. 5 stars.

The Beast of a Billion Backs was an interesting story but I personally didn't think it was that funny. 3 and half stars = 4 for the story, 3 for the (lack of) laughs.

Bender's Game was funnier than BBB but I'm not crazy about parodies because if you've missed the parodied movie.... In this case, it was the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy. 4 stars.

Loved Bender's Big Score... it hearkened back in a small way to season 4, with the exploration of the Fry/Leela relationship. And I like a little drama combined with satire and comedy (and insane characters). Adds depth to the characters, and the show, in my opinion.
That said, I didn't like BWAMB nearly as much as BBBS. It destroyed all the emotional buildup of the end of the original series and the first movie. That threw me off my game in a big way. Also, I would have liked more of the witty zingers and quotables I grew accustomed to with the show.
And I know a lot of people complain about the giant tentacled Yivo. If any of you ever watched a few genuine 1950's B movies, you'd understand why Yivo is there. The DVD cover also makes more sense when you connect BWAMB to movies like The Crawling Eye, and other wacked out sci fi movies of the late 50's. I do admire the Futurama crew for what they attempted here, in lampooning the B movie genre. Sadly, it doesn't measure up to their standards established by the show. Nor does it go far enough in its satire of b movies.
I hope Bender's Game will be an improvement. I REALLY hope Into The Wild Green Yonder surpasses even that.

I have one word of warning for them: Moonlighting. There have been about a half dozen points in the show where the writers could have clicked Fry and Leela together and then just nonchalantly proceeded with them as a couple, the same way they did with Kiff and Amy.

3141459,2,B00158K0V0,"Have been a fan since day one, have the dvds, Xbox game, calendars, comic books, etc.  I find myself quoting the show at least a few times a week, and usually introduce uninitiated friends to the show whenever I get the chance.  Sadly, I can't recommend this film to any but long-time fans, and I'm pretty sure there's a 50/50 chance that they'll be disappointed, like I was.

These films will never live up to the high standard set by the show (watch a few episodes of season 4 in one sitting and you'll understand), but they should do better than this.  The first film did a respectable job carrying on the franchise, tied up some interesting loose ends (ah, Seymour!), showed some emotional depth and managed to pull off a fairly intricate time-travel plot line.  I liked it the first viewing, and have really come to love it after repeated viewings.  It built up a lot of expectation for the remaining films.  But Beast dashes those hopes quite expertly.

The writing is weak.  When one of the highlights is Stephen Hawking shooting lasers out of his eyes, you know there's not much here.  Zoidberg is an afterthought.  Bender's story goes nowhere, wasting a lot of potential (even though actor John Di Maggio is untouchable, as usual).  Amy, while admittedly shallow, sinks to a new low of shallowness after Kif's death.  And there are other gripes... if you're conversant with the shows, you'll see them clearly enough.

The straw that broke the Beast's back for me was the handling of the Fry/Leela relationship.  Fry's lovelorn relationship with Leela has been a major part of the series from the first season.  In Big Score, we see that Fry and Leela can work as a couple, which is hinted at in the series, and seems to be a building story going into Beast.  Let's face it, you've been hoping that Fry will finally get his girl by the end of the 4th movie.  But in Beast it's all thrown away as if it was nothing... Fry falls for a woman who has multiple live-in boyfriends and seems to care absolutely nothing for Leela (as if the events of Big Score didn't just happen).  Years of drama gone without so much as a  whimper.  There's little doubt that Cohen et al will bring things to a tidy conclusion by the final film, but here this is just poor to the point of being pathetic.  And btw, Brittany Murphy's character and acting here are downright irritating.

On the plus side, the regular cast is magnificent.  They help make these movies instantly familiar and comfortable, and you can't help but get excited when the feature starts.  The animation is very good also.  I enjoyed seeing more of Zap and a little less of Hermes.  The special features are worth checking out, and as always the commentary is pretty satisfying in a fanboy sort of way.  Multiple viewings have even lessened the pain of disappointment a bit.

Some Futurama is much better than no Futurama, and at least the disappointment of this film means the next will probably seem much better by comparison.  Hopefully it will be great on its own merits, and not because Beast was in many ways a missed opportunity.",1220572800,6,3094,4.603290676416819

It wasn't great, but it was certainly better than this movie.

'The Beast with a Billion Backs' - the title itself a take-off of the reference in Shakespeare's Othello by Iago when he tells the king, ""Your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs,"" - promised a tongue-in-cheek satirical story.  I anticipated the same depth and level of humor which makes Futurama so different from other animated series, such as Family Guy (which is fraught with silliness and no substance).  I was disappointed by this seemingly quickly written and poorly thought out plot and storyline; I was disappointed by the less-than-stellar portrayal of the show's characters; and I was eager for it to end.

I felt this tone was over-wrought in ""Beast"" and really detracted from the visual style of Futurama which is a much more important facet. The more I watch and think about it the more I dislike it.

I have also never written an online review like this, but felt compelled after seeing this. This movie was a complete disappointment. The pace was slow, many subplots were totally pointless, the portrayal of the characters was completely inconsistent with how they were developed in the series, the main plot was very disturbing, and there was almost no good humor.

The obvious insertion of the flying spaghetti monster (an atheist icon) as the big bad monster and the portrayal of the ""God"" character Yivo (named very similar to Yahweh, the Christian God) as a crazy mass rapist and forceful conqueror is also quite insulting. I'm all for making fun of the ritualistic hyper-religious folk, as we often need to take ourselves a little less seriously, but this seriously crossed the line. We are the ones who should take ourselves more lightly and take God seriously. They might as well as just come out and had one of the characters yell in my face ""I hate you and everything you believe in!"". I can't completely fault them on this point, as I fully know that apart from God's loving intervention in our lives that's what everyone thinks. But to characterize the attention of a God who saves us a loving father as a mass rapist is unbelievably hurtful.

Even with that, the central message was still fairly absent, as the movie seemed to have no coherent message or point. I can't believe I paid money for this, and I'm quite disappointed in the Futurama crew. They should have killed this one even before it made it to an animatic. If this review prevents a few people from buying the DVD and encourages the creators to attempt to undo some of the damage this movie did to their intellectual property, I think the time writing this review will be worth it.",1217808000,4,1850,4.671779141104294
3141523,3,B00158K0V0,"When Futurama first came out by Groening and Cohen, I thought the premise was great, not too Jetsons, but also not too apocalyptic either.  Basically, it dealt with a hapless delivery boy getting accidentally frozen for one thousand years, and awakens to a freaked out future.

Regrettably, thanks to Fox putting it on Football Sundays, the show never really got the notice it deserve, despite the fact it lasted four seasons in its original run.  Yet, it got new life on Adult Swim, and though Comedy Central has it currently, I rarely get to watch it.

Anyway, recently the guys at Futurama decided on reviving the series through four new feature-length films.  The original plan was to 'connect' the films from one to another, but apparently Reality has stepped in and dictated otherwise.

Whereas 'Bender's Big Score,' did focus on the series' Past Episodes, it seems 'Beast with a Billion Backs' throws out all convention and just starts with cannonizing what we knew of the series itself.

Basically the film begins revealing what happened after 'Bender's Big Score,' with the TimeSpace disruption creating an anomaly and ripping a tear in the Universe.

Though the tale runs like a typical Futurama episode, the problem here is, the writers have somehow given up on the Fry/Leela romance, while finally marrying Amy and Kiff.  Though which is humourous, it does lack the typical fare we've come to expect with Futurama.

Perhaps the writers felt since the last film showed Fry jealous of Leela's romance, maybe it was time for the shoe to be on the other foot.  But the problem is, it's a bit too instantaneous for Fry to find romance.  Considering throughout the series the only person he's actually dated have been Amy and Leela, and his Past girlfriend (who later left him for Pauly Shore).

The story's loosely based on a 1955 sci-fi film, ""The Beast with a Million Eyes.""  Except here our Beast takes over with tentacles after Fry decides on leaving his Universe after being unlucky in love once too many times.

The problem here is unlike the other film where the characters interacted with each other throughout the main story line, it seems 'Beast' is a bit disconnected with Bender wanting to join the League of Robots, while Fry convinces the people of Earth of the Beast's good intentions.

Meaning though you'd like to enjoy this second venture, it's rather hard because it seems more like the writers wanted parodying a classic film than genuinely focusing on why we liked Futurama in the first place.

But it doesn't mean the DVD is all bad, we do see some humour with other characters this time around than just focusing on the main characters.  And though the subplots don't have quite the same connection as the first film did, it is fun watching Bender impress Calculon and later subtly take over the League due to the 'Kill All Humans' by-laws.

Though it lacks the sharpness of its first incarnate, 'Beast with a Million Backs,' does have some merits by spoofing classic sci-fi as well as the spoof at the beginning intro.

Hopefully, 'Bender's Game' will make up for the 'Beast's' shortcomings and bring back the main reason why we miss the Planet Express crew for these years.",1217548800,2,3205,4.824497257769653
3141524,5,B00158K0V0,"For me, this came off as being a very solid effort from the Futurama folks. I felt it had a solid amount of comedic beats that worked (I laughed quite a bit) and the story itself was Futurama at its near best -- large and ambitious, enjoyably surreal, philosophical in a biting sort of way, and making pretty decent use of its characters for developing the story. True, it was less ""movie"" like in design, especially in comparison to BGS, as some have pointed out, but that didn't detract from it for me.

I would count myself as a reasonably solid member of the Futurama fanbase, and I've got say Bender's Big Score and now Beast with a Billion Backs (which I actually liked slightly better) have been very rewarding experiences. I disagree with those who say that either have shown some rust in the franchise; to me this is Futurama at its best.

3141554,4,B00158K0V0,"Beware -- below, there be SPOILERS.

I've just finished watching this, and I'm feeling a world of mixed emotions at the moment.

While ""The Beast With a Billion Backs"" definitely had more laugh-out-loud moments than the previous feature, it lacks the emotional heart that made ""Bender's Big Score"" so satisfying. It also features some of the most inconsistent characterization ever seen in ""Futurama"".

In particular, I was really disappointed by the mishandling of Fry and Leela's relationship -- Cohen promised development when these films were announced, not regression. Why would they give Fry a new girlfriend right after breaking new emotional ground in the Fry/Leela relationship during ""Bender's Big Score""? What's the point of showing us that these two can work as a couple if you're just going to stick Fry in a meaningless relationship with a polygamist and then have Leela berate him for 88 minutes?

Almost as annoying is the gross mishandling of Kif and Amy's relationship. It's true that Amy is a little fickle, but I never would have pegged her as being so crass as to sleep with Zapp mere moments after Kif's death. It presents the charter as intensely shallow (even more so than she actually is), and mars what was a sweet relationship throughout the second half of the series. I suppose one could argue that she was grieving and in pain, and Zapp offered comfort, but this is Zapp Brannigan we're talking about. If she'd slept with Fry it might have felt less forced.

The plot itself is pretty good, but it begins to stagnate around 3/4 of the way in. The subplot with Bender feels as though it continues to reiterate itself until such time that it becomes useful to the main plot (in the final act), and the whole thing really lacks the epic feel of the previous film. The story really didn't lend itself to big space battles or amazing revelations, although I will admit that the subjugation of Earth by a creature that just wants love is a really interesting (and somewhat disturbing) concept. The problem is that it just felt like an expanded episode rather than an epic movie, which is what it advertises itself to be. I think it could have easily been truncated into a 30 minute episode.

Having said all that, I do think the film was really enjoyable and I'm eagerly anticipating the next installment. But while this film succeeded in being funnier than ""Bender's Big Score"", it doesn't hold a candle on the character development or emotional fronts.

If I could give it 3 and 1/2 stars, I would. But as I can't, I'm going to be generous and give it a 4 out of 5.",1216857600,,2590,4.704194260485651

3141556,5,B00158K0V0,"I was surprised to read some of the reviews here for BBB.  How could Futurama be getting such low ratings?  Regardless of the reviews I was going to buy this DVD.  I saw it today and I don't know why some people believe it sucks or it's not as funny as Bender's Big Score or doesn't live up to the show.

I laughed throughout the movie.  I found no parts of it to be boring.  I must say that the tentacle jokes were a little disgusting but it's not enough to make one stop watching. (They kinda reminded me of the tentacles in some hentai, lol)  I throughly enjoyed this movie and found it to be funnier than Bender's Big Score.  It was different and the jokes went a little farther than the usual Futurama style but that's what makes it great and something to appreciate. (the CG effects are really great) Why is everyone so afraid of change?

Unlike Bender's Big Score which was mostly a ""will they, won't they be together"" between Fry and Leela, BBB was about whether love should be hoarded by some or for everyone.  I especially found the way ""heaven"" is explained rather interesting.  Also, David Cross does a great job playing Yivo.

Plus the DVD comes with the Lost Episode from the Futurama video game and it is hilarious.  Also the commentary for BBB is hysterical and explains quite a lot.

I'm so glad Futurama is back after so long and I can't wait for Bender's Game to come out.  For the record, I didn't dislike Bender's Big Score.  I want Fry and Leela to get together somehow, it's just the going back and forth that kinda annoys me.

While there were a few laugh-out-loud jokes, the plot came out of left field and dragged on for far too long.

As a big fan of David Cross, I was also disappointed with how unfunny his part in the movie was.

I think the writers and creators are trying to do too much and go too big with the feature-length format. I would have been much happier if they would have just stuck to simple, funny plots that lend to some really solid jokes. A better strategy might have been to write four good episodes and transition them together somehow. It would be less like a movie and more like watching four episodes in a row, but it would hopefully be more like the Futurama the fans love.

3141574,5,B00158K0V0,"First, to the people who are over-analyzing the movie, relax, it's a cartoon.  The same can be said to those who wrote a five page thesis of a review.

I've watched as much Futurama as anyone.  This movie is outstanding; almost as good as the 4th season of the show.  It's entertaining, trippy, funny, and weird.  The plot doesn't jump around as much as the first movie, and the characters that are in Beast are in it because they should be, not because the writers wanted to revisit every single character.  (By the way, I would have given Big Score 4 stars).

I don't understand the complaints about the plot.  The plot has to do with the concepts of heaven, love (and sex), and of alternate universes.  To me, that's pretty deep (right up there with the Godfellas episode in which Bender is God). The sight gags and one liners fit into the movie, not like Family Guy which has to cut to completely unrelated scenes).

Yes, some of the humor is gross, but no worse than Zoidburg vomiting up pearls in the hippie episode.  Yes, some of the characters are a little out of character, but that also happened in the show (see the professor or hermes in the fathering episodes).

I don't know what you people were expecting...an life changing, epic, tour de force?  It's a cartoon, it's funny, it's neat looking, and it reminds me of what Futurama once was.  Enjoy.",1215907200,5,1361,4.524590163934426
3141575,3,B00158K0V0,"The film starts off where Futurama: Bender's Big Score left off, the universe has a giant rip and people are freaking out. The Professor (Billy West), Hermes (Phil LaMarr), Leela (Katey Sagal), Bender (John DiMaggio), Amy (Lauren Tom) and Zoigberg (Billy West) are trying to figure out what to do about the space anomaly. During the meeting, Fry (Billy West) introduces the Planet Express crew to Colleen (Brittany Murphy), his new girlfriend.

Amy and Kip announce they are holding a Fonfon Ru ceremony (joining of families ceremony). The Planet Express crew join the ceremony and ""The Grand Priestess"" performs the ceremony in Kip's home world in the swamp. She also has five other jobs, also grand and she lives there. Colleen catches the bouquet that Kip throws, which makes Fry and Colleen believe it is meant to be with one another.

Later, Professor Farnsworth and Professor Wernstrom (David Herman) are unable to agree on who is going to lead the expedition into space at the University and have the Planet Express crew battle it out in a game of ""Deathball"" against grad students eager for a letter of recommendation. After the game of Deathball, Fry finds out that Colleen has a boyfriend on the opposing team as well as three other boyfriends. Fry decides not to go on the expedition to investigate the space anomaly and to move in with Colleen. Fry unable to deal with not being treated equal in a five-way relationship decides to immediately break up with Colleen. This leads to a big theme of the film with Yivo (David Cross) - a lonely planet with a billion tentacles and one eye.

Bender goes to the space anomaly with the rest of the Planet Express crew to investigate the space anomaly, but due to the fact that he is not human and the electro-magnetic field factor, he blasts the crew back to earth.  Fry frustrated with his love life decides he needs to get far away and hides in the bottom of Zapp Brannigan's ship. Fry later escaping from the lint compartment takes his spacesuit up to the anomaly and says goodbye to everything he knew and cared about and goes through the anomaly where he meets Yivo. Fry desperate for love and Yivo wanting to be cared for, come together.

The tentacles begin to break through the space anomaly and eventually reach earth. Fry as Yivo's host speaks to New New York and tells everyone that he loves the tentacle and they need to love it too. Eventually, Fry becomes the pope, has the rest of the world invaded and everyone with the exception of Leela are invaded by the tentacle. The rest of the film explores on Yivo's need for love and wanting to be in a serious relationship with everyone.

I found this film less exciting than Futurama: Bender's Big Score for several reasons, the film has three different ""feels"" to it: 1/3 feels like a film, 1/3 feels like the TV series, 1/3 feels like and episode of ""Tales of Interest"". I felt the section with Bender and the League of Robots was just used as filler to make the film longer and to have a purpose near the end of the film. There is a lot of American humour throughout the film, but none of it was good and are all one-liners. The only decent humour in the film was more European humour and by that I mean, fans of the series that will see things from the original series and laugh at the guest appearances by certain characters that appear in the film. Some of the other humour comes from Bender, knowing his personality and how he reacts in certain situations. Whilst Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was not a horrid film, it was very average and to a good degree, the ending was almost predictable as well as partly using an event that happened in the TV series.
3/5

Picture:
The film is presented in the 1.78:1 (16:9) format. The picture was crystal clear throughout the film. There were only one or two times when some of the cells seemed a bit blurry, but it is nothing that is noticeable or would deter you from watching the film
4.5/5

Sound:
The film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Unlike Futurama: Bender's Big Score, this film actually takes advantage of all five speakers. Whilst I would have appreciated a few more sounds coming from the rear left and rear right speakers, as it would have given a more cinematic feel, I found that during action sequences the music really made use of all five speakers. The voice actors voices were always clearly audible in the centre speaker during the talking scenes, which for some films can sometimes be problematic.

Final Thoughts:

Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was entertaining enough. However, I can honestly see this as three episodes of Futurama if the script was changed slightly. Fry and Colleen's relationship could have been an episode, Bender and the League of Robots its own episode and lastly Yivo and Earth could have been another single episode. There are many video game jokes in this film which are funny if you are a gamer and it was in Futurama taste. Overall, I would say if you are a Futurama fan you will want to see this  because of the guest appearances from characters from the show, but if you are a casual Futurama watcher I would just say rent it. Last thing I will say is, I watched the trailer for ""Futurama: Bender's Game"" and it looks like rubbish. It looks like a hour and a half version of ""Tales of Interest"" that is Dungeon's and Dragons themed. Yet, you never know it could be good, but I will post a review of that when it is released.",1215907200,,5912,4.660268714011516
3141576,4,B00158K0V0,"I'm a big fan of Futurama to start with and I enjoyed this fun romp through the Futurama Universe.  However, I could definitely see where you could see a stark contrast between this movie and the previous one.  They both are very different styles of movies in terms of Futurama.  This one felt more like a single episode then the previous one.  BBB also has a number of cheap sight-gags that had me rolling, and I would take issue with people who would compare it to Family Guy, simply for the reason that Family Guy uses the non-sequitur as the meat of the joke, this is not at all what was happening in BBB.

I checked out the reviews of BBB first before picking it up, and after seeing it, I'm pretty surprised at the lukewarm reception it seems to be getting in terms of reviews.  I can only assume that peoples expectations of Futurama to be exactly the same as the TV series (even though its stretched out into a movie) are to blame.

As for the extra's on the DVD, I love how I can see the video game CGI, but I would really recommend that people play the Futurama Video Game instead, if you have an original X-Box that is.

3141578,3,B00158K0V0,"The inimitable cast of Futurama returns in the second feature-length animated film, The Beast with a Billion Backs. Once again the outstanding dry humor surfaces, with throwbacks, spoofs and parodies of famous science fiction elements, as well as pop-culture; but this second film begins to show the strain of 3-4 episodes being melded together. Without the usual breaks the TV show afforded, some of the segments run a bit ill-paced toward the conclusion, and no doubt the film would be more enjoyable as the separate episodes that run individually on TV. It's still the genius of Futurama, but it's several of the less impressive adventures.

An electromagnetic alternate universe reveals itself to the frightened people of earth as a space rip anomaly in the sky. Professor Hubert Farnsworth racks his brain for a solution to the possibly hazardous situation, but is contested by his longtime rival Doctor Ogden Wernstrom, who is constantly intent on one-upping him. When Philip Fry (Billy West), a bumbling Planet Express employee is sent into space to implement Ogden's plans, a planet-sized tentacled monster named Yivo (David Cross) emerges, intent on taking over the world.

Leela (Katey Sagal), Farnsworth, Amy, Zoidberg, Hermes, Zapp Brannigan and more must unite to battle the enormous beast, which has sent down his many tentacles to turn the people of Earth into mindless zombie puppets. Fry becomes the tentacle pope of the world and is fixed on forcing everyone to join him as a victim to the enslaving mind-controlling appendages.

Meanwhile, the unsympathetic and crass robot Bender becomes infatuated with television star Calculon, and decides to stalk him. Unearthing the League of Robots, a secretive group of powerful droids teamed to protect the less fortunate robots of the world, Bender eventually joins them only to become jealous of Calculon's leadership. As he plots to unite massive droid armies to usurp planet Earth, the human inhabitants decide to join Yivo in his dimension, after it is determined that all he wants is a meaningful relationship.

Brittany Murphy joins the voice cast as Fry's girlfriend Colleen, a spunky young woman who believes she can satisfy her five boyfriends, much to the dismay of the conventional Fry. A hilarious Deathball tournament is used to settle arguments, the constant scatterbrained machinations of chauvinistic starship captain Zapp Brannigan return, Kif Kroker and Amy Wong take their relationship to the next level, Pazuzu makes an appearance, Nixon's head leads the citizens of Earth, and a Pirates of the Caribbean finale convinces everyone that love is downright awful - and that there is no great love without jealousy. But for all of the nonstop jokes, cameos, and general buffoonery, The Beast With a Billion Backs seems poorly timed during most of its duration.

It's ironic that most criticisms of TV-to-movie adaptations are that the feature merely feels like several episodes stitched together. For the second Futurama film, it literally is several episodes stitched together, and is probably much more entertaining being viewed in its pieces. The Beast With a Billion Backs won't disappoint longtime fans of the show, but it also doesn't add as much excitement for Futurama's reinstatement as the first feature did.

*Interesting use of theology (conflict between the robot devil and Yivo made me think a lot of heaven and hell, obviously).
*Good music (no musical numbers).

The Bad Things
*Some parts are weird or gross (like when Leela discovers that the tentacles are really ""gestacles"").  Most likely, they're trying to make it edgier than the show.
*All of romance could be seen as sappy.

The Questionable Things
*Anticlimatic ending.
*A little inconsistent with the last episode (considering that Fry went through a whole love spiel with Leela, and then turned around and found a new girlfriend.  Will Fry and Leela ever get together?!).  However, these movies are episodic, not accumilative.

While ""Bender's Big Score"" was more like a good Futurama episode, this one is like one of the weaker episodes from the last season.  In particular, it's more of a series of love stories than sci-fi.  It's still good for Futurama fans, but casual viewers are likely to think of this as stupid and strange.

The movie has great video and sound quality, and contains numerous special features (a few featurettes, including a full episode made from cut-scenes from the computer game, and probably some other stuff).  Comes in a neat cardboard case (although this may not be good for keeping the disc clean and scratch-free).",1215734400,,1817,5.023333333333333

There's a few, but not many, hilarious scenes, and a lot of feels like pointless filler or cliched jokes about dating.

Personally, it feels like the format of the movies is what is dragging it down.  Having to make a movie that can easily be split into 4 episodes really messes with the mood; I felt this about both this movie and the last.  However, the last was fun and interesting, whereas this movie was just boring.

I would've rated this a 2* were it not for The Lost Episode, which is included as a bonus on the DVD.  This half-hour (not twenty minutes, 30 minutes) episode is formed from the cutscenes of the old Futurama game.  I avoided the game like the plague because I heard it was terrible, but the cut scenes from it are hilarious.  If you haven't played the game, this episode makes the DVD worth the price of admission for any diehard fan - but be wary of the movie.",1215561600,3,1054,4.331632653061225
3141603,3,B00158K0V0,"I've been a Futurama fan from the very beginning, and was disappointed in Fox's decision to cut this funny, thought provoking series down in mid-flight, and was equally thrilled to learn it wold rise again in the form of several feature-length DVDs.  I enjoyed the first release a great deal, but was less than thrilled with this most recent effort.  While there are several genuinely funny moments, the narrative is disjointed, rambling, and various plot lines don't intersect all that well, and when connections are made they often feel forced and contrived.  If you are not yet a fan but are interested in getting ot know the series, by all means, do so, by starting with Season I.  Jumping in with this feature will only confuse and most likely alienate you and keep you getting to know this smart, hilarious and trenchant TV masterpiece.
The bonus features were pretty much the same things offered in most DVDs, previews, deleted scenes, etc., and the staple of animated features, cast readings.  I enjoy this feature when we get to see the actors working, exploring various takes on how to voice a line, but like many others (Family Guy, etc)  this one consists of short shots of the actors screwing up their lines, making faces, or just laughing randomly at some private cast joke.  On those very rare occasions we see the actors really working it's informative and very entertaining; otherwise it's just irritating, and unfortunately, this falls into that category.  The ""lost"" episode, mentioned by several other reviewers, is worth a look.
Hard core fan? add it to your collection.  I will keep it and no doubt watch it many more times, but I'll also always know that they are capable of much, *much* better work, and look forward to it in the next release.",1215561600,2,1767,4.805280528052806

It was a little slow to get started, hence the 4 stars, but I thought it was great once the main story kicked in.  I can tell the writers, actors and animators are quickly getting their groove back, especially when compared to BBS which I thought was weak on all counts.

The four were generally produced together.  Once again, great 3D animation and voice acting are present.  Unfortunately, the plot this time is a bit weak and drags a lot, especially compared to the time-bending Big Score.  There are some fun jokes, like deathball, but the overall plot seems really, really flat.  Seriously, I was WAITING for this thing to end.  Probably the critical error is that the plot was stretched from a regular episode to short movie length.  Nonetheless, there is enough good material for stars.  In addition, there is the CGI episode within the 2003 futurama video game that is 30 minutes long, another cult fav, and definitely worth watching.",1215388800,2,823,4.870503597122302
3141608,4,B00158K0V0,"I enjoyed it a lot and not JUST because it was a new Futurama episode/movie.

The humor here is sadly more similar to Family Guy and less subtle. Some of it works, some feels really out of place.

The characters seem to be very unlike themselves for the sake of plot. There are a few logical flaws as well. It comes off as overly rushed or edited in some ways.

Even with all these faults the movie is still very funny and enjoyable. I'd say buy it, not because it is great, but because your money will help convince there to be even MORE Futurama. If you are really hard to please, extremely religious with little room for joking, or absolutely loathe the Family guy reference style humor, then maybe just rent or avoid it.

I haven't had a chance to check out the features yet, but I've always enjoyed the Futurama commentaries and other features.

I think the real problem that a lot of people are having is that they are comparing this film with their memories of the show. Yeah, it isn't as good as many of the absolute best episodes, but it still entertaining enough. It may be weak overall for futurama, but it is still better than a large portion of stuff on both film and tv.",1215302400,2,1184,4.339366515837104

There is some sharp writing and comical stuff here, but it's like the reunion tour of the once great band you loved that just isn't the same. If this/these movies were of different origin/source material, my view might be a little more forgiving. But knowing what all involved are capable of, this leaves me somewhat dumbfounded.

I have bought both films and still watch them, but not with as much joy as i watch the series.  The next thing i say may be a spoiler so don't read on if you haven't seen it. The on and off thing with Fry and Leela has gotten too much for me. They had a connection at the end of the series and then boom the begining of the next movie its gone.  Same with at the end of BBS, a connection that is completly gone at the begining of this one.  They could probably have created much more jokes if they said, hey lets just get them together we only have four films anyway.  I know people like what they have seen before but for me its a little old.

I will continue to support the show by buying the dvds, I'm just hoping for a completly histerical film.",1215302400,3,1031,4.014705882352941
3141611,2,B00158K0V0,"I liked the show (most of which I saw for the first time on DVD due to the vagaries of Fox and their scheduling it on Sundays ""after"" (i.e. usually during) the football) and was pretty taken with the first movie too.  This one had me wishing they'd just get on with things and finish it already.  The good material here could have been squashed into a single very funny TV episode.  However, the feel is more that they had a much cleverer movie about 3 hours long and cut it down to 90 minutes by randomly deleting scenes, resulting in a sporadically hilarious, frequently dull mess.  I'd call it predictable, given the simplistic plotline, but even that barely holds together, given the bizarre editing.

It's still funny, but I'd file it along with the ""shall we just skip this episode?"" shows from the DVD sets.  Some very obvious plot directions ignored completely, some interesting ideas introduced and then either barely used or thrown away altogether.  Some scenes that appear to exist only to see how many past characters they can throw in as cameos.  Some scenes repeated ten or twenty times with variations when they weren't even that funny the first time.

Even the twist on the title sequence, while funny, might have been better in the alternate form included as an extra.

The real gem on the DVD is the ""Lost Episode"" - the computer game.  I'm not surprised the game was dropped - lots of cut scenes interrupted by a bunch of games that appear to be variations on the same theme - but the quality of the writing for those cut scenes, and they way the cut scenes are used to ""justify"" the computer game aspects is excellent.  They also don't spend too much time on showing you the game, so the result is something that resembles a graphically crude but well-written episode of the show.  In some ways it rather shows up the ""main feature"".

I think this one's only for the ""must have all things Futurama"" crowd.  Either that or, looking at some of the other reviews, fans of the show fall into several distinct camps who enjoy it for completely different reasons, and this one has almost nothing in it for whatever camp I'm in.

As for the people who don't like the packaging - well, it's very B-movie, which is actually pretty appropriate.  In fact, if the movie title wasn't actually related to the plot (such as it is), the name would be too, as this'll doubtless end up abbreviated as ""Futurama: BBB"" thereby rating itself with its own title.",1215302400,2,2460,4.579908675799087

3141643,5,B00158K0V0,"(NB: There are spoilers in the second paragraph, although not much more than you'd find on the DVD's packaging. You've been warned!)

Although the initial reaction from fans seems lukewarm, I think The Beast with a Billion Backs will be recognized as the better of the first two Futurama movies in years to come. Less dependent on gags and nostalgic reunion-album kitchen-sinkism than Bender's Big Score, Beast avoids the flaws that bedeviled its otherwise great predecessor and presents a more even, if a little less exciting, experience. What it does deliver is genuine laughs, obscure sci-fi references, and a deep meditation on love--both sacred and profane.

Sacred, you may ask? The religious allusions are heavy, but thoughtful, in the vein of Godfellas. Beast presents a god-like being (Yivo--YiHVoH?) who proclaims universal love and offers universal joy in exchange for commitment. Is that so wrong? Yivo may have ulterior motives, but if someone says shle loves you and makes you truly happy, what does shlis motives matter?

The answers, of course, are highly subjective, and may even appear hypocritical, driven as they are by personal desire rather than universal standards. Hypocrisy, selfishness, and the ever-looming threat of armageddon are the bread and butter of Futurama, and they are in abundance here.",1215216000,4,1324,5.295238095238095
3141644,3,B00158K0V0,"I was really looking forward to this one after finally seeing Bender's Big Score recently.  BBS had the layered, intricate, sometimes difficult to understand, and ultimately highly entertaining plotline that was the hallmark of the best Futurama episodes from the original series (i.e. Roswell that Ends Well).  This 2nd installment falls more along the lines of the weaker episodes of the show, which relied on gag humor and wandering, uninspired plotlines (i.e. The Cryonic Woman).

There are always a few bright spots that keep you watching though.  I thought the clip with Bender's first born was hilarious, but for the most part the jokes miss the mark.  It appears the hour and a half format is proving difficult to sustain for the writers.  Clips that wouldn't make the cut in a regular episode have to be featured to fill up the extra time.

As noted by some previous reviews, the character development has taken a step back here.  Fry has regressed (if that is possible) into a love-starved fool from the old carefree, bachelor chow eating caveman.  I won't throw in any spoilers, but Amy also falls prey to deevolution as a means to grind the plot forward and provide some cheap laughs.

Despite the movie's failings, Any moderately interested fan of the series should find this installment worth a watch.  You need to keep up on the story developments in order to transition to the next movie.  I'm hoping that at least one of the last two movies will be up to par with BBS.  2 out of 4 would be pretty good for a series pulled out the ashes.",1215216000,4,1553,4.686346863468635

The artwork, however, is great; my suggestion is save the inserts, toss the actual cover aside and get a regular plastic case if you care to watch the movie a second time.

That's the other problem for me; this movie was unbelievably boring.  The clever humor, timing and character interaction that is a Futurama hallmark are totally absent from ""The Beast with a Billion Backs"".  Even the voice actors didn't seem to really be into their performances, but that might be a side-effect of me being completely bored by what was happening on screen.

Other plot points involve Fry's disasterous attempt at dating as well as Amy's ""marraige"" to Kif. BwaBB is cute, but it just doesn't seem to really live up to it's predecessor, Bender's Big Score.

First, I am a man of faith and this movie was disturbing to say the least.  I'm not a Bible-thumper, but let me explain: any good Bible will tell you that God desires to experience intimate fellowship in heaven with his people.  ""The Beast With A Billion Backs"" instead twisted intimate fellowship into this being who pulls people into his 'heaven' to bond with them 'sexually'.  The movie then takes the whole idea of homosexuality, elevates that to sexuality with a androgynous being (neither male or female), then takes that to sex with everyone at once -- essentially some kind of group orgy with a 'god'.  I'm not making this up.  Really weird and disturbing stuff.  83% of Americans claim to be Christian according to a recent ABC poll.  That means that roughly 8 out of 10 people viewing this movie will find it offensive.

Secondly, on a secular view for those who do not believe in God, the movie had surprisingly few laughs; nothing at all compared to such great episodes as: ""A Pharaoh to Remember"", ""Raging Bender"", ""Amazon Women in the Mood"", ""Roswell That Ends Well"", ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"", etc., etc.  Those and many others are absolutely hilarious.

But I personally enjoyed it a lot more. The story is not as complex, but it holds it own, and more importantly does not get in the way of the humor. I felt like at certain times during BBS, they had to cram so many plot references (time travels and flash backs) that comedy took a back seat. Here laughs are the #1 priority. And despite what some others have said, this movie features complex jokes as well as simple ones. Yes, there's some ""Family Guy"" style humor, but that show just took the premise of the early Simpson's seasons and ran with it, so if you are in any way a fan of that style, you will like this feature.

The audio and visuals are great. I particularly found the ""transformation"" that the Earth endures very well done. The packaging is the same style as BBS.

Great voice acting as always, and the exclusion of any more musical numbers was a plus (while I usually don't mind Futurama's song efforts, I just don't like my cartoons to sing...so sue me).

My one complaint; Carbon-Neutral....again.  The artwork in the ""case"" is all very nice.  But It ticks me off to no end that I paid 25 bucks for a DVD that comes in what is essentially a friggin' sleeve.  Even if I bought into ""climate change"", I would still want my movie in a standard DVD case, and I wouldn't care if you had to burn down 100 acres of rain forest to do it.

Just a quick note for the reviewer who commented on the inconsistancy of Yivo saying that he sent his image to the minds of artists when they said he (Yivo) thought that he was alone....pay attention.  It is mentioned on at least two seperate occasions, once by Fry, the other by Yivo himself, that he (again, Yivo) watched the development of our universe ever since the big bang.

(I'm guessing they would realize this on how much nibbler knew on the mechanics of time travel from the last movie) plus based on the plot of this movie there complete absence is even more disturbing.

No musical numbers! Oh come on guys what where you thinking? If there were any I must have fallen asleep and missed it. BBS had some great musical numbers like ""This trinity is going to war"" one of my favorite futurama tunes.

Now those two things are some of my biggest complaints but overall this story is completely awful/dull. It starts off with trying to study the rip as the main story and Fry having a girlfriend as the side story. It starts out okay but after Fry has a falling out with his current girlfriend ( I hope that wasn't a spoiler for you) this is when the story goes down hill.

A devious entity voiced by David Cross which makes the devious entity seem less devious and more of a pushover. Comes to take over the universe. The entire universe but he actually comes ... to make love to it. (Don't ask)

One last note if you are particular religious, I would doubly recommend you don't see this movie. Hard core Christians might find the end to be some what offensive.",1214784000,2,1566,4.458041958041958

Very few laugh-out-loud moments, a chuckle or two and a rather strange heaven bent to the whole thing. The Fry subplot was lame. Bender's was probably the best bit.

Loaded with numerous gag and joke callbacks from the series and a ridiculously dumb plot and story make this a big let down for me. This movie fails to follow the developments of the 1st movie let alone the series by having most everyone out of character.

Fry falls in love with another woman (and leaves the universe just because she wasn't right for him) right after the events of the 1st movie with Lars and all? Oh, come on! Amy sleeps with Zapp after Kiff is dead wtf? Bender decides to try to kill himself just because he heard ""The league of Robots"" (which somehow never existed until now and Bender idolizes them now) didn't exist. Bender suddenly hates humans and becomes like he was in ""Fear of a Bot Planet"" ...in the first season of the series. ..There's probably more.. shoot, basically everyone is out of character.. Maybe Zapp and Amy's parents aren't.

As for the general story.. it was incredibly dumb. The entire universe falling in love with a tentacle monster from a another universe just doesn't seem to make much sense.. and the fact that it was similar and referred to as Heaven when they all left was just plain.. strange.

As for the jokes.. if they weren't cheap callbacks from the series, they were just disgusting. Though it wasn't all bad, I did laugh at a few Zoidberg gags but that's pretty much it.

It was pretty disappointing. Maybe the writers should stick to their Math books rather than writing a dvd movie. After this debacle, I do not have much faith in the last 2 movies.",1214784000,2,1529,4.569343065693431

This movie drops the ball multiple levels.  There is practically no followup to the plot of BBS, the characters feel really off somehow, and the plot just felt like it dragged on and on.

In its defense, however, I will say that the first act started off fairly strong with a lot of laughs; after that, it just felt like the writers had no idea where to go, and the humor, character interaction, and plot just seemed to dry up.

You know there's a problem when you start checking the clock to see how much longer the movie is going to run.  But, hopefully, this is just a slight misstep in what otherwise is an incredibly fun show.",1214784000,5,767,4.328671328671328

It is more a bunch of jokes put together with no clear purpose and then put together in a hurry using a stupid plot. As far as I am concerned futurama was a ""real"" sitcom that just happened to be setup in the future which allowed for jokes that would otherwise be nonsensical in a different setting. Well if you are like me, who thinks the first 6~9 seasons of the simpsons were good until it just got to be a bunch of nonsense put together about the wacky adventures of Homer, well this is exactly what the beast with a billion backs is. It has no character interaction, the story does not flow, it just sucks (I am sorry to say).",1214784000,5,784,4.1644736842105265

(That's right, you heard me.) I'm ecstatic that Futurama has returned from the dead, and I totally loved ""Bender's Big Score."" But this new Futurama flick disappoints. Most of what we know and love about Futurama is still here in spades, but this flick suffers from a poorly-developed plot and a degeneration of the show's formerly deep and subversive humor.

The 88-minute format is either too long for a compact and focused plotline, or too short for the type of complex story the producers appear to be striving for. The story here jumps around at a very awkward pace and shows signs of severe over-editing. The jokes have been reduced to Family Guy-like asides played for cheap guffaws rather than deep thoughts. (The caped superhero is an unfortunate example, and Bender's firstborn son is a very unfortunate example.)

Many holes and inconsistencies in the storyline show that plot construction took a backseat to the more easily written sight gags and cheap asides. (Here's an example that hopefully won't be condemned as a spoiler. Late in the film the new Yivo character says he [sklee] sent an image of himself to artists in our universe, but most of the story is built on the idea that Yivo thought he was alone in all universes.) The fundamental story has also trumped the longstanding strengths of the show. The personalities of Fry and Leela (and important supporting characters like Kif) are inconsistent, Bender has been demoted to an unworkable subplot, and Zoidberg does little more than vomit for simpleminded laughs. There are also many missed opportunities for building upon the cliffhangers left from ""Bender's Big Score.""

You can rest assured that the great Futurama animation, music, and voice acting (the actors have always been the show's unsung heroes) won't disappoint this time around. But the writing will. Certain fans may or may not like the basic story, but the bigger point is that everyone will notice the careless and unprofessional defects in the story. Hopefully this flick will just be a temporary misstep. Console yourself by remembering once again how lucky we are to have Futurama back among the living.

Bad, bad, bad, BAD!!!!  I would have never thought I'd say it, but sadly the abrupt end of the series on a high note was a better end to Futurama than the garbage they've turned out in the direct to DVD features.

Overall, I did not enjoy this film as much as the first one, Bender's Big Score.  I did not find it nearly as witty, but the storyline was good and fun, and David Cross at Yivo shows that he is still hilarious.

The special features are good as well.  Unlike Bender's Big Score, there are not quite as many special features, but what they have is good stuff for the watching.

I recommend this film to any Futurama fan.  If you are a true fan, you will probably buy this no matter what I said anyway, I know that I was getting this DVD no matter what!  =)

Yivo, Deathball...

It introduces us to Yivo (David Cross) as a planet with purple tentacles that wants to mate with earth because he was lonely.  There's a great sub plot with Bender joining the League of Robots.  And a C plot involving Kiff, Amy and Zapp Brannagin.

3141701,3,B00158K0V0,"I remember when the first episode of Futurama aired on TV. I was in highschool. The show really grew on me, and throughout college, I grown to love the show. I was quite happy to see the show on Cartoon Network, and even more happy when the seasons made it to DVD. Needless to say, I enjoyed probably thousands of hours with Futurama. Recently, the makers decided it was time to re-air the show in the form of movies. I believe altogether, there will be four DVDs although I can't quite remember. The Beast with a Billion Backs is the second DVD released.

This DVD starts off where Bender's Big Score left off. The show starts off quite good, but when the movie ends, I felt somewhat disappointed. Normally, Futurama has a formula to it: the team - mainly Leela, Fry, and Bender with support from other members from time to time - work together to resolve some issue. In a Beast with a Billion Backs, the Futurama formula isn't quite there. The story takes a odd turn that it normally doesn't take. By the end of the film, I felt that the characters detached from one another. Like it felt great that it ended with everyone together, but throughout the movie, it felt like it detached some how. Can't really say much without spoiling it for newcomers though.

As a Futurama fan possibly talking to another Futurma fan, all I can say is that you should give this movie a shot. I felt the usual Futurama formula wasn't quite there; the characters felt detached somewhat. And on top of all the problems, the story doesn't settle quite well in the stomach.

In all, I think the movie was alright. Hopefully the next DVD release will follow the usual Futurama formula, but as it stands, this current DVD release felt somewhat out of place in the Futuram world.",1214611200,2,1756,4.515723270440252

As usual, Bender and Zoidberg were the best part. I'll watch it again because its Futurama, but really its not their best episode. I will say though that the ending was good (which is why I gave it a 3 instead of less).",1214611200,2,359,4.217391304347826
3141723,2,B00158K0V0,"It seems that there there are two distinctly different types of futurama fans. The first class hated Bender's Big Score (BBS) and seem to love Beast with a Billion Backs (BBB). I'm in the other group though. I thought BBS was terrific! I loved it. The same cannot be said for BBB. If you liked BBS, I predict you will not like this one.

One flaw is that everyone seems so out of character. Fry and Leela completely ignore each other throughout the movie and they apparently forgot about what happened in the last movie. It is quite frustrating to watch Fry and Leela having no interest in each other after all that has happened.

My biggest concern, however, is that Futurama is headed in the direction of Family Guy. You know what I mean if you've seen it, it is that crude, raunchy, disgusting sort of humor. I don't like it, I don't think it is funny, and I don't think that's what Futurama is all about! Futurama used to have a higher standard of humor.

I was excited to watch this and about the first 30 minutes are great, but it goes downhill quick. I actually fell asleep the first time I watch it about 45 minutes into the film. The second half just seems to drag on and on and on. I wish they would have just brought the TV show back. If this was a 20 minute episode it might have been good, but it certainly doesn't cut it as a full length movie.",1214611200,5,1358,4.255813953488372
3141724,4,B00158K0V0,"Following the excellent but not wholly successful ""Bender's Big Score"", we get the ""Beast with a Billion Backs,"" a radical change in focus and tone which could be described almost exactly the same way. Again, the fact that this is essentially four episodes stuck together means the tone swings wildly and the story sometimes meanders more than a little, but at the heart of it, ""BwaBB"" is chock full of great Futurama moments. It's (perhaps thankfully) a little less cameo-heavy than BBS, and Fry/Leela shippers may take exception to its easy dismissal of their angst (again, perhaps thankfully) but don't buy the hype that ""everyone is acting out of character."" Rather, we get to see a different side of some key characters, most notably an oddly dignified Fry and a unusually cynical Leela... but hey, a tear in the fabric of reality will bring out different things in people.

If there is anything surprising about ""BwaBB,"" it may be how strongly it drifts towards sci-fi fantasy in its story, concept, and execution. The laughs are still there, but the third act in particular plays out more like sci-fi horror than cheap comedy. The final act, including the bizzare moral (which at first seems like a throw-away gag, but actually fits nicely into the kind of sci-fi moral-bending we might get from the likes of Philip Jose Farmer) also has deep investments in its scifi/fantasy roots, to the point where it turns into a kind of surreal  meditation on the very meaning of love. It's bizzare, no doubt (and I think it threw a lot of viewers) but it's handled with spectacular deftness which allows it to be both slyly satirical and oddly touching at the same time. Actually, if the film has any serious problems, its that (without spoiling anything) a key event involving a major character and the aftermath of that event seem to not be treated with the gravity they deserve.  You can't ask us to invest in the characters, their stories, and their universe, and then simply shrug off important developements in the name of more jokes. Still, this is ultimately a fairly minor quibble, as  the film gradually ups the ante for all the major characters. Fans of Futurama who identify with the creators' true love of Sci-Fi will walk away very happy with this effort, although, of course, those who are just looking for cheap laughs may find a bit too much to think about.",1214611200,3,2371,4.775609756097561

**WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW!**

1. What the heck happened to continuity? Apparently Leela and Fry have completely forgotten about the Lars drama from the last movie and we're back at square one again (or, really, nothing at all). Fry is dating another woman, and Leela shows absolutely no emotion or any kind of jealous reaction towards it. So, the fact that Lars was Fry and you claimed he was the only man you'd ever love meant nothing?

2. And Fry, what about you? In Big Score you were desperate to win Leela's heart. After you broke up with Colleen I assumed you'd go right back to that, like always. No, it didn't even occur to you. You just put on a space suit and left the universe. If he's going to lose interest in Leela completely (and vice versa) at least tell us why, give us some backstory on it.

3. Despite the fact that Nibbler was freaking out at the end of Big Score, and there came a huge rift in the space-time continuum in the sky, it took them weeks before they even started to investigate it. I don't know, I should think a huge, potentially deadly hole in the sky should get top priority on the world's ""to fix"" list. Besides which, Leela didn't seem to care or notice that Nibbler had run away. Isn't he supposed to be her beloved, spoiled pet?

4. The whole ""lonely"" space monster who secretly mated with everyone on Earth literally behind their backs was... yeah. Then when people find out about what's really happening, he offers to be friends with them, woos them with candy and flowers, and then dates everyone at the same time? The heck?! That's not funny, that's just incredibly weird and skeezy :/

Granted, there was some really funny stuff in there, and I enjoyed it a lot for the first half hour or so, but towards the end I was actually Fast-Forwarding. I was all, ""Shouldn't it be done?"".

I'm not saying Futurama can't be too weird or too serious - they've done both in the past, and done it well (I still can't rewatch Jurassic Bark to this day).

If you're watching this expecting it to be exactly like the show, then you're going in with the wrong mindset. They have 4x the timespan to work with, so of course the pacing, flow, and plot will be a bit different. But with that in mind, it's really good.

The plot was seriously lacking, and the storyline wasn't strung together very well at all. In certain points I found myself thinking ""You mean there's still more? Shouldn't it be over?!"". Also, it seems like they've taken writing cues from the more recent seasons of ""The Simpsons"", many of the jokes were a bit over the top and at the same time low-brow. One of the things I love about Futurama is the creative and clever writing, the jokes that are a bit more clever, and not all physical comedy.

3141738,1,B00158K0V0,"If anything, ""The Beast with a Billion Backs"" has helped me to recognize that while I am a fan of Futurama - I am, thankfully, not a fanboy. I've read over some of the previous reviews extolling the outrageous humor, deep meaning, and (god help me, no pun intended) biblical parallels . . . and I'm afraid that I have to side with the minority and say that this latest effort felt like a half -hearted attempt to try and put a shiny Futurama wrapper on a mish-mash of storylines without direction that get slammed together at the end for an unsatisfying finish. I was so disappointed with this release that it moved me to write my very first review here on Amazon. My one . . . lonely moment of laughter was the guest appearance by Stephen Hawking. That at least justifies the one star rating.

The developments of ""Bender's Big Score"" are all but forgotten and almost every character is out of character. Not to mention the big payoff, the moral after 89 minutes is . . . love isn't really love without jealousy. The End. Wow. I realize that this particular story arc isn't trying to bury us in pointless humor, but when putting it up against previous stories like Jurassic Bark . . . the writing doesn't even compare.

Die hard fans will rave about this video and five star it all day long no matter what anyone says. Weak jokes, even weaker self-references, and a thin plotline lead me to recommend that regular fans of the series rent this and save themselves $16. For me, the true measure of how much I enjoyed this movie is that while I do and will continue to watch seasons 1-4 of the series over and over, I highly doubt this disc will ever come into contact with my DVD player again.

My expectations aren't high for ""Bender's Game"" when it comes out this fall.",1214352000,19,1770,4.423312883435583
3141739,5,B00158K0V0,"Love has always been a topic of movies and TV, but ""Beast with a Billion Backs"" is one of the most encompassing and non-polemic explorations of the emotion I have ever seen.  It covers the entire gamut, from monogamous relationships to polyamorous ones, individual love to universal love, platonic love to erotic love, new love to loss.  And it humorously juxtaposes the cultural trappings of one kind to another to explore the ramifications of each.

It is pretty common to see TV shows that might tackle one of these, and either give a ""hey, isn't this great"" message (like most sit-coms) or a ""it looks good at first, but it isn't so great after all"" angle (like a Twilight Zone ""what looks like heaven is actually hell"").  Maybe that's all you can do in half an hour.  But this movie doesn't give an answer.  We see humanity (at least the Planet Express segment) individually achieve love, and have a couple of chances for universal love by different means, and by the end things end up shattered.  We end up puzzling the issue of what is best ourselves, with some new brilliant insights we had not thought of before.

And I find it surprising that people claim the movie is terrible because it isn't funny.  It seems like they have not seen the show recently, and misremember how it actually was.  Go back to the original series, especially the third and fourth seasons, and see how many jokes there really were.  Humor is not the show's reason for being, it is the wrapper for philosophical and character explorations, just as in most sci-fi.  But don't think this movie isn't funny as well, because it is.  If you thought ""The Sting"" was one of the high-points of the series, and ended up crying at the end of ""Jurassic Bark"", I am certain you will enjoy this movie.",1214352000,15,1773,4.59047619047619
3141740,4,B00158K0V0,"While I enjoyed Bender's Big Score, I felt like the effort was a bit shaky, as no doubt Team Futurama was a little out of practice after their run on Fox ended.

Beast With a Billion Backs wastes no time on exposition and jumps right into rapid-fire and over-the-top gags that actually achieve the big laughs Bender's Big Score failed to deliver.  While the first movie focused on the emotional interplay between Fry and Leela, and storytelling in general, this installment forgoes all of that in favor of jokes and insanity.  Some might find this shallow, but not every episode can be Jurassic Bark (nor should it be).  I personally found this approach refreshing, and felt more like I was watching Futurama and not an homage to it (Big Score).

That being said, there is a (long, winding, bizarre) storyline, and it keeps up the Futurama tradition of brain-bending science fiction twists on sitcom plots.  It's essentially a love story, but it involves multiple dimensions and a being as big as a planet.  I won't go into detail, but it gets pretty weird.  In fact, in places it's downright sinister and creepy, which is new territory for Futurama.  However, I applaud them for experimenting, especially since they really succeeded in acheiving a palpable sense of claustrophobic tension during these scenes.

Due to the fact that this ""movie"" is actually set to be sliced up into 4 individual episodes for air on Comedy Central, the plot doesn't necessarily feel like 1 movie all the way through.  You can distinctly sense a few different acts, which sometimes feel like they have little to do with what preceded them.  This is the only problem I have with the film, but I have a hard time being upset about it.  The overall zaniness and fun of it, the hit ratio of the jokes, and the originality of the plot make this a solid investment to me.

Can't wait for Bender's Game!",1214352000,4,1878,4.703363914373089

I thought Bender's Big Score was a decent effort showing some rust, so to speak, and that the new releases would get better from there. This one is a letdown, though. No doubt, there are some good jokes, and I laughed here and there during the 90 minutes. But the writing really doesn't feel like Futurama. The grossout and mildly sick humor is amped up (it was always there but balanced with the show's sophisticated writing), and in particular, some of the humor that plays on the film's ""rape"" plot has a slightly ugly edge. There's also a lengthy subplot with Calculon that really drags down the film while offering almost no laughs.

The special features are pretty weak too. The deleted scenes reel is very short, the ""blooper"" section is just 2 minutes of the voice actors mugging for the video cameras (though this guy is happy to look at Tress McNeill and Katey Segal), and the full-length ""episode"" created for a video game just doesn't have the laughs.

Bottom line: I eagerly awaited this and bought it day of release; I won't be in such a hurry for the next one (which doesn't look so hot, based on the preview included with this one).",1214352000,41,1246,4.484581497797357

3141763,4,B00158K0V0,"So, reading some of the early reviews here and at various Futurama sites, I was feeling a bit apprehensive, as there was definitely a lot of mixed opinions about the quality of this one.  So, perhaps my expectations were set low initially, but this movie has managed to immediately find a place in my futurama heart.

For reference sake, my favorite Futurama TV episodes are, among others, 300 Big Boys, Jurassic Bark, I Dated a Robot, Parasites Lost, and Why Must I be a Crustacean in Love.  If you were a fan of these, you probably will have a similar ultimate conclusion about this movie.  It's interesting to note that Eric Kaplan had writing credits for all of these episodes and also with Beast with a Billion Backs (BBB), so I guess it's no surprise I ended up liking BBB, too.

I won't bore you with a plot synopsis (there are plenty of other sources for that), so I'll simply lay out a few points.  The characterestics that gave strength to my favorite futurama tv episodes are present here:  a thorougly interesting/creative story, an emotional edge, and fun character interactions.  The pace in BBB meanders compared to Bender's Big Score (BBS)'s rapid joke-firing rate, but that's a strength - it lets the circumstances breathe and really build upon itself (plus there isn't the same insane degree of massive cascading amounts of in-jokes and sly references).  Moreover, compared to BBS, the divisions for marking where this movie will eventually be split into 4 20-minute TV episodes for syndication are alot clearer - there's a definite mood shift for each of the four acts.  However, this effectively episodic nature actually tends to work to its strength, as it lets the writing cover a wide array of topics and themes.

For example, in the early acts with the onset of the massive tentacle beast, I was genuinely drawn in with a degree of suspense that I hadn't ever had before with a Futurama episode or really any animated cartoon.  But later on, the episodic shifts allowed for me to readily enter the more ponderous, introspective last act with little reservation or guard.  Unfortunately though, this episodic nature means that the ending is somewhat anticlimactic - I'm curious to see how it would work on TV since I believe it would be better at the end of a 20 minute episode than an 80 minute movie.  It also means that you'll have a bit of a weird, sinusoidal story arc that builds and detentes several times over the course of the movie, but for the most part I'm pleased with the net result.  Again - suspenseful build up, humorous interim (not to mention the pretty amusing side plot with Bender in the League of Robots), and an almost uncharacteristically contemplative last chapter (where Leela, in a bit of almost genius writing expresses, in a sort of breaking-the-4th-wall post-modern manner, the movie viewer's initial reservation and then acceptance of the situations at hand).

That being said, I can easily see why some Futurama diehards are eager to write this off as worst. episode. ever.  It's fairly raunchy (though I don't see the sexual imagery that some have seen in the Beast and honestly think people who do see that kind of subliminal imagery need to get out more), a bit fearless in making quick, transient changes to the Futurama universe, and really pushes the envelop in the kind of story Futurama can tell (in the sort of way Jurassic Bark or 300 Big Boys did, just in a very different direction); at times the mood can get overly haunting/eerie/cruel.  Plus, Fry and Leela aren't together, which I'm sure is frustrating many a diehard, but I don't see it as any less consistent with how the normal Futurama series treated their relationship.

Overall though, I definitely liked this more than Bender's Big Score - it's fresh, inventive, and (though I didn't discuss it at length) has amazing art direction.  Brittany Murphy and David Cross do a fine job and Stephen Hawking steals his scenes shamelessly well.  I would easily put it amongst the better Futurama episodes, even if it has some noticable flaws.",1214352000,3,4062,4.799139167862267

While the animation was top notch, the story, what there was of it, relied too much on gross outs and rehashing.  It felt like I was watching a combination of brain slugs and Bender's sour relationship with Planet Express Ship that went on for eons too long.

I'll admit, there were funny bits, but there just wasn't enough to keep me interested, especially with Emo! Fry.

I usually give a synopsis of the story of a movie or book in my reviews.  I don't see much point in trying to provide such a summary in this review.  The movie interweaves several different story lines together (Bender and the league of robots, Fry and his new girlfriend, the Universe and Yivo) and none of it is done well.  What happened to Fry's feelings for Leela?  Why does the movie switch from a scifi monster flick to bad chick lit?  How could anyone write something as boring as this movie?

The packaging for the DVD is terrible and makes the DVD prone to scratches prior to ever even opening the case.

I bought this without having seen it because of my love of the show and my love of Bender's big score.  For any future Futurama products I am going to have to rent them first before I choose to own them.

Also, there's no plastic spindle in the middle of the DVD case, just a slot in the cheap cardboard and my DVD came scratched up already because of that.  It still plays but how cheap can Fox be?

And for the record, I really liked ""Bender's Big Score"".  It was FUN ON A BUN.

In fact, this film's plot itself ventures into a genre that I'd much rather have seen Futurama stay at two removes from: romantic comedy.  Except this time it's all the inhabitants of our universe (""Universe Gamma"") in a romantic comedy with a planet-sized tentacled monster from another universe.  There's a Bender sideplot that serves absolutely no purpose except to give Bender screen time and ultimately give him a reason to basically undo everything that happened in the movie, just when one would expect a perfectly Futurama-style twistedly happy ending.

Speaking of undoing things that happened, I really must complain that this film literally resets the past eight years of Futurama continuity.  Since the Niblonians and Brainspawn are no longer in Universe Gamma and every single romantic relationship has been reset to a basic state of ""not existing"", it really appears as though the writers behaved exactly like a dog encountering a chess board: knocking every piece out of its place with no real character development just so they could put them into the absurd places their canine brains desired.

Finally, it has come to my attention that a lot of people got a lot more out of this film by reading it as a portrayal of the events described by the Book of the Revelation of John (aka: the Book of Revelations, aka: that crazy Apocalypse thing).  Despite my knowledge of the story, being a Jew I guess I just can't see the parallels.

3141783,5,B00158K0V0,"Although Matt Groening will forever be remembered for his creation of the Simpsons and the total hysteria that still surrounds what many will agree has become a very bad attempt at comedy. Futurama, however, is something truly unique and has the potential to become Matt Groenings best creation especially when it comes to longevity as the mere setting of the show gives it the potential to be truly unique on a constant basis as the creators can truly go wild with the stories. Going wild is something they really have done with this movie as it's something that you feel is truly bizarre even for a comedy like Futurama. The story starts off with how the last movie finished with a big tear in the universe and nobody having a single idea about what it was.

At the start we're introduced to the gang in all their glory but we learn that Kif and Amy are having a FonFon Rubok (Wedding) and Fry has a new Girlfriend called Colleen, but there's one problem with Colleen and that's she has 5 other boyfriends. Bender has his role in this movie as after the first attempt to pass through the universal tear and injuring himself in the process, he gets the chance to meet Calculon in hospital and decides he wants to be Calculons official stalker, which leads him into the dark underworld of the League of Robots. Through the movie after Fry breaks up with Colleen he votes himself to enter the rift to explore just exactly what it is that's in the alternate universe, we come to find that it's a huge squid monster names Yivo and it enters on a quest to invade our universe.

This is a really good movie and much, much better than the first. The Futurama movies were only made with the intention of being split into episodes for a new season to eventually begin on Comedy Central. They don't seem to look like 3 or 4 episodes put into one long movie. Instead they simply appear as intended and that's a damn good movie. It's filled with some of the best one liners I've heard on an animated show of this kind and one of the best lines were by the character Yivo ""It burns like my gonorrhoea."" This line had me in absolute stitches at the sheer unexpected value of it, this is what makes Futurama so special as it has some of the most creative writing you can imagine. It's not shocking for shocks sake like Family Guy, and it's not ridiculous try hard humour like the current Simpsons seasons it's simply witty comedy that has you roaring with laughter at the genuine wit of the writing.

This and Benders Big Score should be added to your DVD collections along with the upcoming Futurama movies which I can imagine to be just as special.",1214006400,3,2636,4.464730290456432

This is the second Futurama direct-to-DVD movie to come out as part of the series' semi-revival after being canceled by the executive morons at Fox a couple of years back. Now I'm a big Futurama fan so I'm probably biased but I enjoyed this movie. The first direct-to-DVD movie was probably a bit better as it had a more diverse storyline and musical numbers but this one was thoroughly entertaining and I highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the series.

The best thing about this movie is the use of secondary characters. Futurama developed a ridiculously expansive cast during the course of its original 4 year run and the creators are now (wisely in my opinion) expanding beyond focusing on the Planet Express crew. The use of the many robot characters in this one was great, especially Calculon, Millionairebot, Hedonismbot, a large heavily armored robot (whose name I can't remember), and of course the robot devil, who is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Aside from the bots, we also see the return of President Richard Nixon's head, who delivers one of the funniest lines in the movie.

The worst thing about this film may be that fact that the guest voices are underused. Brittany Murphy's performance as a new romantic interest for Fry is well done but ultimately forgettable. Steven Hawking plays himself and while he makes a nice addition with some genuinely funny lines, he's often hard to understand. Also, David Cross plays the role of the giant tentacle monster who is the focus of much of the movie. While he is given some good awkward material to work with, he is never given a chance to shine like he did in Arrested Development. Even so, this is a minor gripe.

  Picking up shortly after the end of the previous film, ""Bender's Big Score"", the people of our universe are in fear of what the new inter-dimensional rift will mean to them and there are those that predict an end to everything is coming soon.
  Back at the Planetary Express Office, life is pretty much as it always is with one exception, Fry (Billy West), has a new girlfriend named Colleen (Brittany Murphy), and is doing well in his new relationship.
  Amy (Lauren Tom) and Kip are also doing well in their relationship and buoyed by the success Fry is having decide to conduct a marriage like ceremony on Kip's swamp filled home planet.
  Soon after, a delegation of leaders from around the cosmos gather to listen to the head of (Steven Hawking) discuss options on how to deal with the latest threat from the universe. Naturally nobody can agree and when Professor Farnsworth (Billy West) runs afoul of his nemesis Doctor Wernstrom they decide to settle their dispute in a hilarious live action version of title ball. Of course the fact that their debate stems from which of their crews is best suited to get slaughtered by exploring the rift is of little consequence.
  Once settled the crew of the Planetary Express under the command of Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal), shifts into high gear as their interpersonal relationships and quirks all come into play, often at the worst time which further complicates a bad situation.
  While this is going on, Bender (John Di Maggio), becomes infatuated with television personality Calculon, and starts down a path that will lead him to becoming part of a secret robotic society whose stated goal is death to all humans.
  As events unfold, an entity known as Yivo (David Cross), who inhabits the dimension on the other side of the rift, starts to control all of the people of our universe which places Fry in a Pope like position as he and the people start to discover the real reason Yivo is interested in our Universe.
  Along the way, there are numerous subplots and some truly classic lines from Zap Brannigan and others as the fate of two universes will soon depend on the actions of the highly dysfunctional characters of the story.
  While some may say the plot of this new Futurama does not grab you the way past episodes did, it does have plenty of humor; much of it comes in scenarios outside the main story arch and allows for some very nostalgic looks book at some of the classic moments from the series. I do not want to spoil any of the surprises, but let's say that the phrase Snu Snu comes back as does some of Bender's past.
  Since this is the second of four planned DVDs, it is clear that the new offering is laying ground work for the next two films as it does not wrap things up in a tidy bow when finished. Instead it provides plenty of laughs and great moments of nostalgia for fans of the series and loads of extras which include deleted scenes, commentaries, and a look at the next film ""Bender's Game"".
All in all a welcome and satisfying film that should delight fans and help keep us happy until the new film arrives in time for the Holidays.

3375775,3,B00158K0V0,"A lot of reviewers found this film inferior to Bender's Big Score, I found that it had its merits and put it at about par with that film. To me, Bender's Big Score was a bit too emotional, and in strange narwhal-ish ways; this film is more aloof, with Fry showing off his new girlfriend Colleen to the Planet Express crew, including Leela. It starts out with cool, goofy historical animation segments (we get a whole episode dedicated to this in Season 6, Reanimation). Colleen's five boyfriends are funny, as is Amy's sexy funeral dress (!?!). Great lines like ""mutilation is never easy,"" ""you're the only universe in the world"", ""there is no love without great jealousy"", and the question to one-eyed Leela ""were you winking or blinking?"" Love the basketball planet too!

The bonus features are quite expansive, with a full segment from the Futurama video game, showing the 3-D animated storyline bits that come between game play, augmented with commentary and better sound effects. ""Farewell big blue ball of idiots!"" The chicken walker! Great Mom lines like ""we'll just have to hunt them down like common kittens"" and ""try harder, you son-of-a-me!"" There's a Farnsworth head, and giant robots - ""and so I die the way I lived - as a giant robot."" Fry's offscreen gun shot as he robs a pawn shop! From the commentary we find out that there was a strange Farnsworth university section that involved no real action that was never created in the end.

We also get a very long animatic (21:38) for people who like that sort of thing, and there are also several deleted scenes: the awesome ""original opening storyboard"" (0:34), where the narrator becomes a character who is hunted down by Bender, ""Fry and Colleen meeting"" (0:34), ""St Asimov Parade storyboard"" (0:20) that's pretty funny, ""Zapp and Scientists"" (0:46) that's pretty similar to what appeared in the movie anyway, ""Amy, Fry and Leela Storyboard"" (0:28), ""Scruffy the Janitor layout automatic"" (0:28) that has to be seen to be believed (Leela, how could you!?!). Then there's a David Cross meets Yivo mini-documentary (2:00) that's kind of silly/irrelevant/waste of time. ""Blooperama: the Futurama cast at 'work'"" (2:12) is pretty goofy and it's just what you'd think - four men and two women in a sound studio. There's a ""3D Models Animators' discussion"" (4:11) where we get into the technical aspects of the Diamondillium-armoured Earth scene, a space ship take-off, M5438, Kiff's mom/bug cloud/swarm, Bender's pirate ship, busy space vehicles, the wooden ship, and the anomaly and tentacles. Finally, in ""A Brief History of Deathball"" we find out how the costumes and maze layout were designed.

The title cards for the menus and sub-menus are good fun too, with campy comic book/horror film references like ""In glorious Grope-a-scope""!",1433116800,,2799,5.01505376344086

The success of Bender's Big Score changed that. Seeing that a Futurama movie could not only live up to the quality of the show-but even possibly surpass it-was, as the Professor would say, wonderful news. Beast with a Billion Backs instantly rose to the top of my most anticipated lists for this summer, and I have to say it delivered.

Unlike Big Score, Billion Backs is more new material and less reliance on nostalgia. Where Big Score got their laughs from bringing back characters and tying together refrences in zany ways, Billion Backs has little to do with the show itself. The story takes place directly after Big Score, after the rift in the universe tears space asunder. The earth is panicking, and scientists are gathered to find a solution. After much debate (and Death Ball), the Planet Express crew is sent to man an expedition to the rift when they discover that nothing mechanical can pass through.

Hurt, Bender returns home and sulks while humanity and the other organic lifeforms plan ways to destroy whatever universe lies on the other side. During his sulking, Bender meets up with the League of Robots, an all-robot group originally designed to destroy humanity, but which has since lots its purpose.

Meanwhile, Fry stows away on a military spaceship (bet you can guess who the captain in charge of the mission is!) and flings himself into the other universe, trying to escape from it all. What Fry ends up finding (and bringing back with him) will forever change the course of our galaxy's history.

CONTENT: 4/5

The story in Beast with a Billion Backs isn't the greatest we've ever seen from the series, but it definitely belongs with the other strong episodes and Big Score. The interaction between the various characters goes to a level deeper than the show did, and we see new aspects of people we thought we already fully understood.

David Cross provides the voice for the titular beast, and does an amazing job making it one of the more memorable cameos in the history of Futurama. If you're a fan of the series, this is definitely a must-watch story arc which is sure to bring a smile to your face with the witty writing we're so used too.

VIDEO: 3.5/5

The movie's animation is about par with the series, but nothing about it really blows you away any more than the episodes on DVD or Big Score. Colors and the design of some of the elements is nice, but I feel like BwaBB takes less chances with the art direction than past Futurama works, and relies heavily instead on the earth and other familiar locales. The only truly new and original locale (which you'll see near the end of the movie) isn't exactly original in its design.

For you videophiles, though, the transfer is nice and smooth with no noticeable fading, is in native widescreen, and although there are a few grainy moments overall the blacks stay dark and consistent.

AUDIO: 4/5

The audio might not be as technically impressive as other movies, but the voice acting remains superb, and shows why Futurama was one of the most popular (and most respected) cartoons of all time. David Cross's work in this is tremendous, and only makes me want to have him become a regular contributor to the show once it's back on the air. Toss in 11 cast commentary tracks, and you're all set.

REPLAY: 5/5

Like the show, the replay value for Beast with a Billion Backs is off the charts for those who enjoy the show. Jokes remain funny and stand up well to repeated viewings.

EXTRAS: 4.5/5

You have to hand it to the Futurama crew, because they certainly know how to stock their products. Other than the aforementioned 11+ commentary tracks, Beast with a Billion Backs features deleted scenes, a short piece on David Cross's participation, a history of Deathball, a look at the next Futurama movie (the fantasy-based Bender's Game), and best of all, the entire 30 minute episode one could have watched by playing through the Futurama videogame. I never enjoyed the game enough to play through to view the story, but now you can watch it in its sorta-3D goodness uninterrupted.

OVERALL: 4/5

Beast with a Billion Backs isn't the best thing Futurama has ever produced, but it's certainly not in the bottom half. It's a very solid production for fans used to the show, and is a must-own for any fans.",1249689600,,4563,4.73989898989899

If that aspect of the plot is too weird, there's a really fun side plot with Bender and the other robots.

3375897,2,B00158K0V0,"A viewer wrote ""some Futurama is better than no Futurama."" I dissent.
I own the entire series (after having been a faithful fan of the series). And a couple of episodes were genuine heartbreakers, but most were excellent. Some were just funny and that's the worst I intend to say about the series. But it _always_ had heart. That was the secret ingredient to Futurama's success: we ""felt"" for the characters, despite their obvious flaws--or perhaps because of them! Despite their dysfunction they never lost their humanity or their ability to acknowledge their flaws. And at episode's end they each had made some peace with those flaws. The characters _chose_ their outcomes and conclusions.
That said, ""Beast"" broke its boundaries! It does not equal ""Bender's Big Score"" which gave closure to a couple of the more unsettling (yes, the _heart-breaking_ ones; I'll never hear Connie Francis's ""If it takes forever"" the same way again; thank you, very much...) episodes.
Hey, guys, much as I love the series, ""Beast"" _destroys_ the spirit of the entire series. Be forewarned. ""Beast's"" plot is despicable and perverse; Bender evolves from his arrogant, dishonest self to a shallow, narcissistic and mean-spirited jealous sociopath who holds human choice in contempt.
Perhaps this film was meant to strike a blow for nihilists and cynics the universe over, but did it have to do it in such an angry manner (in a strange way, its ending reminded me of a humorous ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" the Jeff Goldblum/Donald Sutherland version)?
Can't say I admired the spirit behind ""Beast."" ""Beast"" is heartless. Futurama is a success. Has this success destroyed its writers' inner beauty and ability to have fun?
Conversely, I have to admit that ""Beast"" makes its point (in its warped way) about the _eternal_ conflict in the human soul between the human yearning for a loving, nurturing utopia (back to the womb?) and the endless struggle that life is. For we define ourselves as humans and individuals--and existence itself--by this struggle, by how we learn to deal with this daily struggle and, to a degree, how we ""control"" the outcome.
Life is, after all, a cosmic game. Do we ""win"" by cooperating with each other or by competing with each other to death? It's about human choice, whether you believe in ""free will"" or not. Bender, a robot--a man-made tool--I sensed, subverted the process-OR did he perpetuate it? Is the mean-spirited _destruction_ of the choices of others our _true human destiny_?
Rent this one. And be careful. It's point and viewpoint may make you cringe. 2 and half to 3 stars, max.",1240531200,2,2607,4.981651376146789

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come alive)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all excellent!
Following the cancellation of the show (I wonder what ""genius"" came up with that idea???) life was pretty hard without these amazing characters. The comic books are good, but nothing beats the actual show, so it's so good to have everybody back.

3375924,3,B00158K0V0,"I was already unhappy with the first Futurama movie, so I didn't have much hope for the second.  I was surprised to see that this installment of Futurama is actually two awkward subplots mashed together: Lovecraftian horror for the first half, and a meditation on religion on the second half.

On the Lovecraftian side, throw in tentacle attacks, slimy ancient gods from beyond time and space, and the nihilistic view that Heaven is a fabrication and you've got a pretty depressing, semi-creepy, not really all that funny first half.  Bender finally makes good on his threat to destroy all humans, Fry conveniently forgets his entire relationship with Leela, the Robot Devil shows up for a one-note gag ... I could go on but I'll stop there.

Judging by the reviews so far, the second half went over a lot of peoples' heads.  Yivo is a parody of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is itself a parody of religion.  Basically, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a mental construct posed to challenge the notion of a divine being; if you can disprove that the Spaghetti Monster was responsible you win the argument. ""Win"" being a pretty subjective word, as anyone knows who has argued about religion or politics.

As one big joke about relationships and religion, Beast With a Billion Backs works pretty well.  But for reasons known only to the writers, the plot shambles forward well beyond the Big Revelation by Leela about Yivo, the aforementioned Spaghetti Monster. It's like the drunk guy at a party who tells a joke, discovers no one thinks it's funny, then tells it in a slightly different way that STILL doesn't make it funny.  We get it: relationships with people can be just as ridiculous as relationships with God.  But this is Futurama, and while I appreciate the depth of meaning the show strives for with this movie, it feels forced.  A multitude of guest appearances doesn't make up for it.

Still, I can't be too harsh on Futurama.  You won't find many animated shows that are willing to take on topics like relationships and religion at the same time, so Futurama gets points for trying.  I just wish it didn't try so hard.",1228262400,4,2135,4.750677506775068

Of the three, I loved BBS the best. There were a lot of funny jokes and I love how they complexly interwove time travel into the movie. When you watch with the commentary on, you learn of all the thought that went behind this movie (e.g. numbers in the background, how they came up with equations, etc.) which they didn't do in the subsequent two movies. Couldn't watch the whole Hypnotoad episode. Zzzzzz. 5 stars.

The Beast of a Billion Backs was an interesting story but I personally didn't think it was that funny. 3 and half stars = 4 for the story, 3 for the (lack of) laughs.

Bender's Game was funnier than BBB but I'm not crazy about parodies because if you've missed the parodied movie.... In this case, it was the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy. 4 stars.

Loved Bender's Big Score... it hearkened back in a small way to season 4, with the exploration of the Fry/Leela relationship. And I like a little drama combined with satire and comedy (and insane characters). Adds depth to the characters, and the show, in my opinion.
That said, I didn't like BWAMB nearly as much as BBBS. It destroyed all the emotional buildup of the end of the original series and the first movie. That threw me off my game in a big way. Also, I would have liked more of the witty zingers and quotables I grew accustomed to with the show.
And I know a lot of people complain about the giant tentacled Yivo. If any of you ever watched a few genuine 1950's B movies, you'd understand why Yivo is there. The DVD cover also makes more sense when you connect BWAMB to movies like The Crawling Eye, and other wacked out sci fi movies of the late 50's. I do admire the Futurama crew for what they attempted here, in lampooning the B movie genre. Sadly, it doesn't measure up to their standards established by the show. Nor does it go far enough in its satire of b movies.
I hope Bender's Game will be an improvement. I REALLY hope Into The Wild Green Yonder surpasses even that.

I have one word of warning for them: Moonlighting. There have been about a half dozen points in the show where the writers could have clicked Fry and Leela together and then just nonchalantly proceeded with them as a couple, the same way they did with Kiff and Amy.

3375956,2,B00158K0V0,"Have been a fan since day one, have the dvds, Xbox game, calendars, comic books, etc.  I find myself quoting the show at least a few times a week, and usually introduce uninitiated friends to the show whenever I get the chance.  Sadly, I can't recommend this film to any but long-time fans, and I'm pretty sure there's a 50/50 chance that they'll be disappointed, like I was.

These films will never live up to the high standard set by the show (watch a few episodes of season 4 in one sitting and you'll understand), but they should do better than this.  The first film did a respectable job carrying on the franchise, tied up some interesting loose ends (ah, Seymour!), showed some emotional depth and managed to pull off a fairly intricate time-travel plot line.  I liked it the first viewing, and have really come to love it after repeated viewings.  It built up a lot of expectation for the remaining films.  But Beast dashes those hopes quite expertly.

The writing is weak.  When one of the highlights is Stephen Hawking shooting lasers out of his eyes, you know there's not much here.  Zoidberg is an afterthought.  Bender's story goes nowhere, wasting a lot of potential (even though actor John Di Maggio is untouchable, as usual).  Amy, while admittedly shallow, sinks to a new low of shallowness after Kif's death.  And there are other gripes... if you're conversant with the shows, you'll see them clearly enough.

The straw that broke the Beast's back for me was the handling of the Fry/Leela relationship.  Fry's lovelorn relationship with Leela has been a major part of the series from the first season.  In Big Score, we see that Fry and Leela can work as a couple, which is hinted at in the series, and seems to be a building story going into Beast.  Let's face it, you've been hoping that Fry will finally get his girl by the end of the 4th movie.  But in Beast it's all thrown away as if it was nothing... Fry falls for a woman who has multiple live-in boyfriends and seems to care absolutely nothing for Leela (as if the events of Big Score didn't just happen).  Years of drama gone without so much as a  whimper.  There's little doubt that Cohen et al will bring things to a tidy conclusion by the final film, but here this is just poor to the point of being pathetic.  And btw, Brittany Murphy's character and acting here are downright irritating.

On the plus side, the regular cast is magnificent.  They help make these movies instantly familiar and comfortable, and you can't help but get excited when the feature starts.  The animation is very good also.  I enjoyed seeing more of Zap and a little less of Hermes.  The special features are worth checking out, and as always the commentary is pretty satisfying in a fanboy sort of way.  Multiple viewings have even lessened the pain of disappointment a bit.

Some Futurama is much better than no Futurama, and at least the disappointment of this film means the next will probably seem much better by comparison.  Hopefully it will be great on its own merits, and not because Beast was in many ways a missed opportunity.",1220572800,6,3094,4.603290676416819

It wasn't great, but it was certainly better than this movie.

'The Beast with a Billion Backs' - the title itself a take-off of the reference in Shakespeare's Othello by Iago when he tells the king, ""Your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs,"" - promised a tongue-in-cheek satirical story.  I anticipated the same depth and level of humor which makes Futurama so different from other animated series, such as Family Guy (which is fraught with silliness and no substance).  I was disappointed by this seemingly quickly written and poorly thought out plot and storyline; I was disappointed by the less-than-stellar portrayal of the show's characters; and I was eager for it to end.

I felt this tone was over-wrought in ""Beast"" and really detracted from the visual style of Futurama which is a much more important facet. The more I watch and think about it the more I dislike it. It feels like a real sell-out. Perhaps my antipathy is magnified by the third-rate writing. The plot is extremel weak.

I have also never written an online review like this, but felt compelled after seeing this. This movie was a complete disappointment. The pace was slow, many subplots were totally pointless, the portrayal of the characters was completely inconsistent with how they were developed in the series, the main plot was very disturbing, and there was almost no good humor.

The obvious insertion of the flying spaghetti monster (an atheist icon) as the big bad monster and the portrayal of the ""God"" character Yivo (named very similar to Yahweh, the Christian God) as a crazy mass rapist and forceful conqueror is also quite insulting. I'm all for making fun of the ritualistic hyper-religious folk, as we often need to take ourselves a little less seriously, but this seriously crossed the line. We are the ones who should take ourselves more lightly and take God seriously. They might as well as just come out and had one of the characters yell in my face ""I hate you and everything you believe in!"". I can't completely fault them on this point, as I fully know that apart from God's loving intervention in our lives that's what everyone thinks. But to characterize the attention of a God who saves us a loving father as a mass rapist is unbelievably hurtful.

Even with that, the central message was still fairly absent, as the movie seemed to have no coherent message or point. I can't believe I paid money for this, and I'm quite disappointed in the Futurama crew. They should have killed this one even before it made it to an animatic.

3376020,3,B00158K0V0,"When Futurama first came out by Groening and Cohen, I thought the premise was great, not too Jetsons, but also not too apocalyptic either.  Basically, it dealt with a hapless delivery boy getting accidentally frozen for one thousand years, and awakens to a freaked out future.

Regrettably, thanks to Fox putting it on Football Sundays, the show never really got the notice it deserve, despite the fact it lasted four seasons in its original run.  Yet, it got new life on Adult Swim, and though Comedy Central has it currently, I rarely get to watch it.

Anyway, recently the guys at Futurama decided on reviving the series through four new feature-length films.  The original plan was to 'connect' the films from one to another, but apparently Reality has stepped in and dictated otherwise.

Whereas 'Bender's Big Score,' did focus on the series' Past Episodes, it seems 'Beast with a Billion Backs' throws out all convention and just starts with cannonizing what we knew of the series itself.

Basically the film begins revealing what happened after 'Bender's Big Score,' with the TimeSpace disruption creating an anomaly and ripping a tear in the Universe.

Though the tale runs like a typical Futurama episode, the problem here is, the writers have somehow given up on the Fry/Leela romance, while finally marrying Amy and Kiff.  Though which is humourous, it does lack the typical fare we've come to expect with Futurama.

Perhaps the writers felt since the last film showed Fry jealous of Leela's romance, maybe it was time for the shoe to be on the other foot.  But the problem is, it's a bit too instantaneous for Fry to find romance.  Considering throughout the series the only person he's actually dated have been Amy and Leela, and his Past girlfriend (who later left him for Pauly Shore).

The story's loosely based on a 1955 sci-fi film, ""The Beast with a Million Eyes.""  Except here our Beast takes over with tentacles after Fry decides on leaving his Universe after being unlucky in love once too many times.

The problem here is unlike the other film where the characters interacted with each other throughout the main story line, it seems 'Beast' is a bit disconnected with Bender wanting to join the League of Robots, while Fry convinces the people of Earth of the Beast's good intentions.

Meaning though you'd like to enjoy this second venture, it's rather hard because it seems more like the writers wanted parodying a classic film than genuinely focusing on why we liked Futurama in the first place.

But it doesn't mean the DVD is all bad, we do see some humour with other characters this time around than just focusing on the main characters.  And though the subplots don't have quite the same connection as the first film did, it is fun watching Bender impress Calculon and later subtly take over the League due to the 'Kill All Humans' by-laws.

Though it lacks the sharpness of its first incarnate, 'Beast with a Million Backs,' does have some merits by spoofing classic sci-fi as well as the spoof at the beginning intro.

Hopefully, 'Bender's Game' will make up for the 'Beast's' shortcomings and bring back the main reason why we miss the Planet Express crew for these years.",1217548800,2,3205,4.824497257769653
3376021,5,B00158K0V0,"For me, this came off as being a very solid effort from the Futurama folks. I felt it had a solid amount of comedic beats that worked (I laughed quite a bit) and the story itself was Futurama at its near best -- large and ambitious, enjoyably surreal, philosophical in a biting sort of way, and making pretty decent use of its characters for developing the story. True, it was less ""movie"" like in design, especially in comparison to BGS, as some have pointed out, but that didn't detract from it for me.

I would count myself as a reasonably solid member of the Futurama fanbase, and I've got say Bender's Big Score and now Beast with a Billion Backs (which I actually liked slightly better) have been very rewarding experiences. I disagree with those who say that either have shown some rust in the franchise; to me this is Futurama at its best. The writing is sharp; the production and direction is sharp; and the voice acting remains top notch and has shown no signs of fading from the passage of years.",1217548800,,1007,4.502732240437158

3376051,4,B00158K0V0,"Beware -- below, there be SPOILERS.

I've just finished watching this, and I'm feeling a world of mixed emotions at the moment.

While ""The Beast With a Billion Backs"" definitely had more laugh-out-loud moments than the previous feature, it lacks the emotional heart that made ""Bender's Big Score"" so satisfying. It also features some of the most inconsistent characterization ever seen in ""Futurama"".

In particular, I was really disappointed by the mishandling of Fry and Leela's relationship -- Cohen promised development when these films were announced, not regression. Why would they give Fry a new girlfriend right after breaking new emotional ground in the Fry/Leela relationship during ""Bender's Big Score""? What's the point of showing us that these two can work as a couple if you're just going to stick Fry in a meaningless relationship with a polygamist and then have Leela berate him for 88 minutes?

Almost as annoying is the gross mishandling of Kif and Amy's relationship. It's true that Amy is a little fickle, but I never would have pegged her as being so crass as to sleep with Zapp mere moments after Kif's death. It presents the charter as intensely shallow (even more so than she actually is), and mars what was a sweet relationship throughout the second half of the series. I suppose one could argue that she was grieving and in pain, and Zapp offered comfort, but this is Zapp Brannigan we're talking about. If she'd slept with Fry it might have felt less forced.

The plot itself is pretty good, but it begins to stagnate around 3/4 of the way in. The subplot with Bender feels as though it continues to reiterate itself until such time that it becomes useful to the main plot (in the final act), and the whole thing really lacks the epic feel of the previous film. The story really didn't lend itself to big space battles or amazing revelations, although I will admit that the subjugation of Earth by a creature that just wants love is a really interesting (and somewhat disturbing) concept. The problem is that it just felt like an expanded episode rather than an epic movie, which is what it advertises itself to be. I think it could have easily been truncated into a 30 minute episode.

Having said all that, I do think the film was really enjoyable and I'm eagerly anticipating the next installment. But while this film succeeded in being funnier than ""Bender's Big Score"", it doesn't hold a candle on the character development or emotional fronts.

If I could give it 3 and 1/2 stars, I would. But as I can't, I'm going to be generous and give it a 4 out of 5.",1216857600,,2590,4.704194260485651

3376053,5,B00158K0V0,"I was surprised to read some of the reviews here for BBB.  How could Futurama be getting such low ratings?  Regardless of the reviews I was going to buy this DVD.  I saw it today and I don't know why some people believe it sucks or it's not as funny as Bender's Big Score or doesn't live up to the show.

I laughed throughout the movie.  I found no parts of it to be boring.  I must say that the tentacle jokes were a little disgusting but it's not enough to make one stop watching. (They kinda reminded me of the tentacles in some hentai, lol)  I throughly enjoyed this movie and found it to be funnier than Bender's Big Score.  It was different and the jokes went a little farther than the usual Futurama style but that's what makes it great and something to appreciate. (the CG effects are really great) Why is everyone so afraid of change?

Unlike Bender's Big Score which was mostly a ""will they, won't they be together"" between Fry and Leela, BBB was about whether love should be hoarded by some or for everyone.  I especially found the way ""heaven"" is explained rather interesting.  Also, David Cross does a great job playing Yivo.

Plus the DVD comes with the Lost Episode from the Futurama video game and it is hilarious.  Also the commentary for BBB is hysterical and explains quite a lot.

I'm so glad Futurama is back after so long and I can't wait for Bender's Game to come out.  For the record, I didn't dislike Bender's Big Score.  I want Fry and Leela to get together somehow, it's just the going back and forth that kinda annoys me.

While there were a few laugh-out-loud jokes, the plot came out of left field and dragged on for far too long.

As a big fan of David Cross, I was also disappointed with how unfunny his part in the movie was.

I think the writers and creators are trying to do too much and go too big with the feature-length format. I would have been much happier if they would have just stuck to simple, funny plots that lend to some really solid jokes. A better strategy might have been to write four good episodes and transition them together somehow. It would be less like a movie and more like watching four episodes in a row, but it would hopefully be more like the Futurama the fans love.

3376071,5,B00158K0V0,"First, to the people who are over-analyzing the movie, relax, it's a cartoon.  The same can be said to those who wrote a five page thesis of a review.

I've watched as much Futurama as anyone.  This movie is outstanding; almost as good as the 4th season of the show.  It's entertaining, trippy, funny, and weird.  The plot doesn't jump around as much as the first movie, and the characters that are in Beast are in it because they should be, not because the writers wanted to revisit every single character.  (By the way, I would have given Big Score 4 stars).

I don't understand the complaints about the plot.  The plot has to do with the concepts of heaven, love (and sex), and of alternate universes.  To me, that's pretty deep (right up there with the Godfellas episode in which Bender is God). The sight gags and one liners fit into the movie, not like Family Guy which has to cut to completely unrelated scenes).

Yes, some of the humor is gross, but no worse than Zoidburg vomiting up pearls in the hippie episode.  Yes, some of the characters are a little out of character, but that also happened in the show (see the professor or hermes in the fathering episodes).

I don't know what you people were expecting...an life changing, epic, tour de force?  It's a cartoon, it's funny, it's neat looking, and it reminds me of what Futurama once was.  Enjoy.",1215907200,5,1361,4.524590163934426
3376072,3,B00158K0V0,"The film starts off where Futurama: Bender's Big Score left off, the universe has a giant rip and people are freaking out. The Professor (Billy West), Hermes (Phil LaMarr), Leela (Katey Sagal), Bender (John DiMaggio), Amy (Lauren Tom) and Zoigberg (Billy West) are trying to figure out what to do about the space anomaly. During the meeting, Fry (Billy West) introduces the Planet Express crew to Colleen (Brittany Murphy), his new girlfriend.

Amy and Kip announce they are holding a Fonfon Ru ceremony (joining of families ceremony). The Planet Express crew join the ceremony and ""The Grand Priestess"" performs the ceremony in Kip's home world in the swamp. She also has five other jobs, also grand and she lives there. Colleen catches the bouquet that Kip throws, which makes Fry and Colleen believe it is meant to be with one another.

Later, Professor Farnsworth and Professor Wernstrom (David Herman) are unable to agree on who is going to lead the expedition into space at the University and have the Planet Express crew battle it out in a game of ""Deathball"" against grad students eager for a letter of recommendation. After the game of Deathball, Fry finds out that Colleen has a boyfriend on the opposing team as well as three other boyfriends. Fry decides not to go on the expedition to investigate the space anomaly and to move in with Colleen. Fry unable to deal with not being treated equal in a five-way relationship decides to immediately break up with Colleen. This leads to a big theme of the film with Yivo (David Cross) - a lonely planet with a billion tentacles and one eye.

Bender goes to the space anomaly with the rest of the Planet Express crew to investigate the space anomaly, but due to the fact that he is not human and the electro-magnetic field factor, he blasts the crew back to earth.  Fry frustrated with his love life decides he needs to get far away and hides in the bottom of Zapp Brannigan's ship. Fry later escaping from the lint compartment takes his spacesuit up to the anomaly and says goodbye to everything he knew and cared about and goes through the anomaly where he meets Yivo. Fry desperate for love and Yivo wanting to be cared for, come together.

The tentacles begin to break through the space anomaly and eventually reach earth. Fry as Yivo's host speaks to New New York and tells everyone that he loves the tentacle and they need to love it too. Eventually, Fry becomes the pope, has the rest of the world invaded and everyone with the exception of Leela are invaded by the tentacle. The rest of the film explores on Yivo's need for love and wanting to be in a serious relationship with everyone.

I found this film less exciting than Futurama: Bender's Big Score for several reasons, the film has three different ""feels"" to it: 1/3 feels like a film, 1/3 feels like the TV series, 1/3 feels like and episode of ""Tales of Interest"". I felt the section with Bender and the League of Robots was just used as filler to make the film longer and to have a purpose near the end of the film. There is a lot of American humour throughout the film, but none of it was good and are all one-liners. The only decent humour in the film was more European humour and by that I mean, fans of the series that will see things from the original series and laugh at the guest appearances by certain characters that appear in the film. Some of the other humour comes from Bender, knowing his personality and how he reacts in certain situations. Whilst Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was not a horrid film, it was very average and to a good degree, the ending was almost predictable as well as partly using an event that happened in the TV series.
3/5

Picture:
The film is presented in the 1.78:1 (16:9) format. The picture was crystal clear throughout the film. There were only one or two times when some of the cells seemed a bit blurry, but it is nothing that is noticeable or would deter you from watching the film
4.5/5

Sound:
The film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Unlike Futurama: Bender's Big Score, this film actually takes advantage of all five speakers. Whilst I would have appreciated a few more sounds coming from the rear left and rear right speakers, as it would have given a more cinematic feel, I found that during action sequences the music really made use of all five speakers. The voice actors voices were always clearly audible in the centre speaker during the talking scenes, which for some films can sometimes be problematic.

Final Thoughts:

Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was entertaining enough. However, I can honestly see this as three episodes of Futurama if the script was changed slightly. Fry and Colleen's relationship could have been an episode, Bender and the League of Robots its own episode and lastly Yivo and Earth could have been another single episode. There are many video game jokes in this film which are funny if you are a gamer and it was in Futurama taste. Overall, I would say if you are a Futurama fan you will want to see this  because of the guest appearances from characters from the show, but if you are a casual Futurama watcher I would just say rent it. Last thing I will say is, I watched the trailer for ""Futurama: Bender's Game"" and it looks like rubbish. It looks like a hour and a half version of ""Tales of Interest"" that is Dungeon's and Dragons themed. Yet, you never know it could be good, but I will post a review of that when it is released.",1215907200,,5912,4.660268714011516

However, I could definitely see where you could see a stark contrast between this movie and the previous one.  They both are very different styles of movies in terms of Futurama.  This one felt more like a single episode then the previous one.  BBB also has a number of cheap sight-gags that had me rolling, and I would take issue with people who would compare it to Family Guy, simply for the reason that Family Guy uses the non-sequitur as the meat of the joke, this is not at all what was happening in BBB.

I checked out the reviews of BBB first before picking it up, and after seeing it, I'm pretty surprised at the lukewarm reception it seems to be getting in terms of reviews.  I can only assume that peoples expectations of Futurama to be exactly the same as the TV series (even though its stretched out into a movie) are to blame.

As for the extra's on the DVD, I love how I can see the video game CGI, but I would really recommend that people play the Futurama Video Game instead, if you have an original X-Box that is.

3376075,3,B00158K0V0,"The inimitable cast of Futurama returns in the second feature-length animated film, The Beast with a Billion Backs. Once again the outstanding dry humor surfaces, with throwbacks, spoofs and parodies of famous science fiction elements, as well as pop-culture; but this second film begins to show the strain of 3-4 episodes being melded together. Without the usual breaks the TV show afforded, some of the segments run a bit ill-paced toward the conclusion, and no doubt the film would be more enjoyable as the separate episodes that run individually on TV. It's still the genius of Futurama, but it's several of the less impressive adventures.

An electromagnetic alternate universe reveals itself to the frightened people of earth as a space rip anomaly in the sky. Professor Hubert Farnsworth racks his brain for a solution to the possibly hazardous situation, but is contested by his longtime rival Doctor Ogden Wernstrom, who is constantly intent on one-upping him. When Philip Fry (Billy West), a bumbling Planet Express employee is sent into space to implement Ogden's plans, a planet-sized tentacled monster named Yivo (David Cross) emerges, intent on taking over the world.

Leela (Katey Sagal), Farnsworth, Amy, Zoidberg, Hermes, Zapp Brannigan and more must unite to battle the enormous beast, which has sent down his many tentacles to turn the people of Earth into mindless zombie puppets. Fry becomes the tentacle pope of the world and is fixed on forcing everyone to join him as a victim to the enslaving mind-controlling appendages.

Meanwhile, the unsympathetic and crass robot Bender becomes infatuated with television star Calculon, and decides to stalk him. Unearthing the League of Robots, a secretive group of powerful droids teamed to protect the less fortunate robots of the world, Bender eventually joins them only to become jealous of Calculon's leadership. As he plots to unite massive droid armies to usurp planet Earth, the human inhabitants decide to join Yivo in his dimension, after it is determined that all he wants is a meaningful relationship.

Brittany Murphy joins the voice cast as Fry's girlfriend Colleen, a spunky young woman who believes she can satisfy her five boyfriends, much to the dismay of the conventional Fry. A hilarious Deathball tournament is used to settle arguments, the constant scatterbrained machinations of chauvinistic starship captain Zapp Brannigan return, Kif Kroker and Amy Wong take their relationship to the next level, Pazuzu makes an appearance, Nixon's head leads the citizens of Earth, and a Pirates of the Caribbean finale convinces everyone that love is downright awful - and that there is no great love without jealousy. But for all of the nonstop jokes, cameos, and general buffoonery, The Beast With a Billion Backs seems poorly timed during most of its duration.

It's ironic that most criticisms of TV-to-movie adaptations are that the feature merely feels like several episodes stitched together. For the second Futurama film, it literally is several episodes stitched together, and is probably much more entertaining being viewed in its pieces. The Beast With a Billion Backs won't disappoint longtime fans of the show, but it also doesn't add as much excitement for Futurama's reinstatement as the first feature did.

*Excellent animation quality.
*Some good hilarious dialogue and funny scenes (without relying too heavily on catch phrases or old gags).  Also a little bit of action and some kind of a cute love story (although some of you might hate the romance).
*A few of nostalgic homages to older Futurama episodes (expect to see some familiar characters and some references).
*Story was not bad, and contained some interesting ideas (albiet it was strange and went off into some weird directions).
*Interesting use of theology (conflict between the robot devil and Yivo made me think a lot of heaven and hell, obviously).
*Good music (no musical numbers).

The Bad Things
*Some parts are weird or gross (like when Leela discovers that the tentacles are really ""gestacles"").  Most likely, they're trying to make it edgier than the show.
*All of romance could be seen as sappy.

The Questionable Things
*Anticlimatic ending.
*A little inconsistent with the last episode (considering that Fry went through a whole love spiel with Leela, and then turned around and found a new girlfriend.  Will Fry and Leela ever get together?!).  However, these movies are episodic, not accumilative.

While ""Bender's Big Score"" was more like a good Futurama episode, this one is like one of the weaker episodes from the last season.  In particular, it's more of a series of love stories than sci-fi.  It's still good for Futurama fans, but casual viewers are likely to think of this as stupid and strange.

The movie has great video and sound quality, and contains numerous special features (a few featurettes, including a full episode made from cut-scenes from the computer game, and probably some other stuff).

I would've rated this a 2* were it not for The Lost Episode, which is included as a bonus on the DVD.  This half-hour (not twenty minutes, 30 minutes) episode is formed from the cutscenes of the old Futurama game.  I avoided the game like the plague because I heard it was terrible, but the cut scenes from it are hilarious.  If you haven't played the game, this episode makes the DVD worth the price of admission for any diehard fan - but be wary of the movie.",1215561600,3,1054,4.331632653061225
3376100,3,B00158K0V0,"I've been a Futurama fan from the very beginning, and was disappointed in Fox's decision to cut this funny, thought provoking series down in mid-flight, and was equally thrilled to learn it wold rise again in the form of several feature-length DVDs.  I enjoyed the first release a great deal, but was less than thrilled with this most recent effort.  While there are several genuinely funny moments, the narrative is disjointed, rambling, and various plot lines don't intersect all that well, and when connections are made they often feel forced and contrived.  If you are not yet a fan but are interested in getting ot know the series, by all means, do so, by starting with Season I.  Jumping in with this feature will only confuse and most likely alienate you and keep you getting to know this smart, hilarious and trenchant TV masterpiece.
The bonus features were pretty much the same things offered in most DVDs, previews, deleted scenes, etc., and the staple of animated features, cast readings.  I enjoy this feature when we get to see the actors working, exploring various takes on how to voice a line, but like many others (Family Guy, etc)  this one consists of short shots of the actors screwing up their lines, making faces, or just laughing randomly at some private cast joke.  On those very rare occasions we see the actors really working it's informative and very entertaining; otherwise it's just irritating, and unfortunately, this falls into that category.  The ""lost"" episode, mentioned by several other reviewers, is worth a look.
Hard core fan? add it to your collection.  I will keep it and no doubt watch it many more times, but I'll also always know that they are capable of much, *much* better work, and look forward to it in the next release.",1215561600,2,1767,4.805280528052806

If you are a fan of the series you'll enjoy seeing more Futurama, but if you are a casual fan or just getting into the series, stick with the Seasons 1-4 DVDs.",1215388800,3,472,4.153846153846154

It was a little slow to get started, hence the 4 stars, but I thought it was great once the main story kicked in.  I can tell the writers, actors and animators are quickly getting their groove back, especially when compared to BBS which I thought was weak on all counts.

The four were generally produced together.  Once again, great 3D animation and voice acting are present.  Unfortunately, the plot this time is a bit weak and drags a lot, especially compared to the time-bending Big Score.  There are some fun jokes, like deathball, but the overall plot seems really, really flat.  Seriously, I was WAITING for this thing to end.  Probably the critical error is that the plot was stretched from a regular episode to short movie length.  Nonetheless, there is enough good material for stars.  In addition, there is the CGI episode within the 2003 futurama video game that is 30 minutes long, another cult fav, and definitely worth watching.",1215388800,2,823,4.870503597122302
3376105,4,B00158K0V0,"I enjoyed it a lot and not JUST because it was a new Futurama episode/movie.

The humor here is sadly more similar to Family Guy and less subtle. Some of it works, some feels really out of place.

The characters seem to be very unlike themselves for the sake of plot. There are a few logical flaws as well. It comes off as overly rushed or edited in some ways.

Even with all these faults the movie is still very funny and enjoyable. I'd say buy it, not because it is great, but because your money will help convince there to be even MORE Futurama. If you are really hard to please, extremely religious with little room for joking, or absolutely loathe the Family guy reference style humor, then maybe just rent or avoid it.

I haven't had a chance to check out the features yet, but I've always enjoyed the Futurama commentaries and other features.

I think the real problem that a lot of people are having is that they are comparing this film with their memories of the show. Yeah, it isn't as good as many of the absolute best episodes, but it still entertaining enough. It may be weak overall for futurama, but it is still better than a large portion of stuff on both film and tv.",1215302400,2,1184,4.339366515837104

There is some sharp writing and comical stuff here, but it's like the reunion tour of the once great band you loved that just isn't the same. If this/these movies were of different origin/source material, my view might be a little more forgiving. But knowing what all involved are capable of, this leaves me somewhat dumbfounded.

I have bought both films and still watch them, but not with as much joy as i watch the series.  The next thing i say may be a spoiler so don't read on if you haven't seen it. The on and off thing with Fry and Leela has gotten too much for me. They had a connection at the end of the series and then boom the begining of the next movie its gone.  Same with at the end of BBS, a connection that is completly gone at the begining of this one.  They could probably have created much more jokes if they said, hey lets just get them together we only have four films anyway.  I know people like what they have seen before but for me its a little old.

I will continue to support the show by buying the dvds, I'm just hoping for a completly histerical film.",1215302400,3,1031,4.014705882352941
3376108,2,B00158K0V0,"I liked the show (most of which I saw for the first time on DVD due to the vagaries of Fox and their scheduling it on Sundays ""after"" (i.e. usually during) the football) and was pretty taken with the first movie too.  This one had me wishing they'd just get on with things and finish it already.  The good material here could have been squashed into a single very funny TV episode.  However, the feel is more that they had a much cleverer movie about 3 hours long and cut it down to 90 minutes by randomly deleting scenes, resulting in a sporadically hilarious, frequently dull mess.  I'd call it predictable, given the simplistic plotline, but even that barely holds together, given the bizarre editing.

It's still funny, but I'd file it along with the ""shall we just skip this episode?"" shows from the DVD sets.  Some very obvious plot directions ignored completely, some interesting ideas introduced and then either barely used or thrown away altogether.  Some scenes that appear to exist only to see how many past characters they can throw in as cameos.  Some scenes repeated ten or twenty times with variations when they weren't even that funny the first time.

Even the twist on the title sequence, while funny, might have been better in the alternate form included as an extra.

The real gem on the DVD is the ""Lost Episode"" - the computer game.  I'm not surprised the game was dropped - lots of cut scenes interrupted by a bunch of games that appear to be variations on the same theme - but the quality of the writing for those cut scenes, and they way the cut scenes are used to ""justify"" the computer game aspects is excellent.  They also don't spend too much time on showing you the game, so the result is something that resembles a graphically crude but well-written episode of the show.  In some ways it rather shows up the ""main feature"".

I think this one's only for the ""must have all things Futurama"" crowd.  Either that or, looking at some of the other reviews, fans of the show fall into several distinct camps who enjoy it for completely different reasons, and this one has almost nothing in it for whatever camp I'm in.

As for the people who don't like the packaging - well, it's very B-movie, which is actually pretty appropriate.  In fact, if the movie title wasn't actually related to the plot (such as it is), the name would be too, as this'll doubtless end up abbreviated as ""Futurama: BBB"" thereby rating itself with its own title.",1215302400,2,2460,4.579908675799087

3376140,5,B00158K0V0,"(NB: There are spoilers in the second paragraph, although not much more than you'd find on the DVD's packaging. You've been warned!)

Although the initial reaction from fans seems lukewarm, I think The Beast with a Billion Backs will be recognized as the better of the first two Futurama movies in years to come. Less dependent on gags and nostalgic reunion-album kitchen-sinkism than Bender's Big Score, Beast avoids the flaws that bedeviled its otherwise great predecessor and presents a more even, if a little less exciting, experience. What it does deliver is genuine laughs, obscure sci-fi references, and a deep meditation on love--both sacred and profane.

Sacred, you may ask? The religious allusions are heavy, but thoughtful, in the vein of Godfellas. Beast presents a god-like being (Yivo--YiHVoH?) who proclaims universal love and offers universal joy in exchange for commitment. Is that so wrong? Yivo may have ulterior motives, but if someone says shle loves you and makes you truly happy, what does shlis motives matter?

The answers, of course, are highly subjective, and may even appear hypocritical, driven as they are by personal desire rather than universal standards. Hypocrisy, selfishness, and the ever-looming threat of armageddon are the bread and butter of Futurama, and they are in abundance here.",1215216000,4,1324,5.295238095238095
3376141,3,B00158K0V0,"I was really looking forward to this one after finally seeing Bender's Big Score recently.  BBS had the layered, intricate, sometimes difficult to understand, and ultimately highly entertaining plotline that was the hallmark of the best Futurama episodes from the original series (i.e. Roswell that Ends Well).  This 2nd installment falls more along the lines of the weaker episodes of the show, which relied on gag humor and wandering, uninspired plotlines (i.e. The Cryonic Woman).

There are always a few bright spots that keep you watching though.  I thought the clip with Bender's first born was hilarious, but for the most part the jokes miss the mark.  It appears the hour and a half format is proving difficult to sustain for the writers.  Clips that wouldn't make the cut in a regular episode have to be featured to fill up the extra time.

As noted by some previous reviews, the character development has taken a step back here.  Fry has regressed (if that is possible) into a love-starved fool from the old carefree, bachelor chow eating caveman.  I won't throw in any spoilers, but Amy also falls prey to deevolution as a means to grind the plot forward and provide some cheap laughs.

Despite the movie's failings, Any moderately interested fan of the series should find this installment worth a watch.  You need to keep up on the story developments in order to transition to the next movie.  I'm hoping that at least one of the last two movies will be up to par with BBS.  2 out of 4 would be pretty good for a series pulled out the ashes.",1215216000,4,1553,4.686346863468635

That's the other problem for me; this movie was unbelievably boring.  The clever humor, timing and character interaction that is a Futurama hallmark are totally absent from ""The Beast with a Billion Backs"".  Even the voice actors didn't seem to really be into their performances, but that might be a side-effect of me being completely bored by what was happening on screen.

Other plot points involve Fry's disasterous attempt at dating as well as Amy's ""marraige"" to Kif. BwaBB is cute, but it just doesn't seem to really live up to it's predecessor, Bender's Big Score.

First, I am a man of faith and this movie was disturbing to say the least.  I'm not a Bible-thumper, but let me explain: any good Bible will tell you that God desires to experience intimate fellowship in heaven with his people.  ""The Beast With A Billion Backs"" instead twisted intimate fellowship into this being who pulls people into his 'heaven' to bond with them 'sexually'.  The movie then takes the whole idea of homosexuality, elevates that to sexuality with a androgynous being (neither male or female), then takes that to sex with everyone at once -- essentially some kind of group orgy with a 'god'.  I'm not making this up.  Really weird and disturbing stuff.  83% of Americans claim to be Christian according to a recent ABC poll.  That means that roughly 8 out of 10 people viewing this movie will find it offensive.

Secondly, on a secular view for those who do not believe in God, the movie had surprisingly few laughs; nothing at all compared to such great episodes as: ""A Pharaoh to Remember"", ""Raging Bender"", ""Amazon Women in the Mood"", ""Roswell That Ends Well"", ""Fry and the Slurm Factory"", etc., etc.  Those and many others are absolutely hilarious.

But I personally enjoyed it a lot more. The story is not as complex, but it holds it own, and more importantly does not get in the way of the humor. I felt like at certain times during BBS, they had to cram so many plot references (time travels and flash backs) that comedy took a back seat. Here laughs are the #1 priority. And despite what some others have said, this movie features complex jokes as well as simple ones. Yes, there's some ""Family Guy"" style humor, but that show just took the premise of the early Simpson's seasons and ran with it, so if you are in any way a fan of that style, you will like this feature.

The audio and visuals are great. I particularly found the ""transformation"" that the Earth endures very well done. The packaging is the same style as BBS.

Great voice acting as always, and the exclusion of any more musical numbers was a plus (while I usually don't mind Futurama's song efforts, I just don't like my cartoons to sing...so sue me).

My one complaint; Carbon-Neutral....again.  The artwork in the ""case"" is all very nice.  But It ticks me off to no end that I paid 25 bucks for a DVD that comes in what is essentially a friggin' sleeve.  Even if I bought into ""climate change"", I would still want my movie in a standard DVD case, and I wouldn't care if you had to burn down 100 acres of rain forest to do it.

Just a quick note for the reviewer who commented on the inconsistancy of Yivo saying that he sent his image to the minds of artists when they said he (Yivo) thought that he was alone....pay attention.  It is mentioned on at least two seperate occasions, once by Fry, the other by Yivo himself, that he (again, Yivo) watched the development of our universe ever since the big bang.

The Nibblonians are completely gone.  Why Nibbler didn't erase anybody memory last time. The futurama crew knows of them now and of how technologically advanced they are compared to the rest of the universe. (I'm guessing they would realize this on how much nibbler knew on the mechanics of time travel from the last movie) plus based on the plot of this movie there complete absence is even more disturbing.

No musical numbers! Oh come on guys what where you thinking? If there were any I must have fallen asleep and missed it. BBS had some great musical numbers like ""This trinity is going to war"" one of my favorite futurama tunes.

Now those two things are some of my biggest complaints but overall this story is completely awful/dull.

It starts out okay but after Fry has a falling out with his current girlfriend ( I hope that wasn't a spoiler for you) this is when the story goes down hill.

A devious entity voiced by David Cross which makes the devious entity seem less devious and more of a pushover. Comes to take over the universe. The entire universe but he actually comes ... to make love to it. (Don't ask)

Loaded with numerous gag and joke callbacks from the series and a ridiculously dumb plot and story make this a big let down for me. This movie fails to follow the developments of the 1st movie let alone the series by having most everyone out of character.

Fry falls in love with another woman (and leaves the universe just because she wasn't right for him) right after the events of the 1st movie with Lars and all? Oh, come on! Amy sleeps with Zapp after Kiff is dead wtf? Bender decides to try to kill himself just because he heard ""The league of Robots"" (which somehow never existed until now and Bender idolizes them now) didn't exist. Bender suddenly hates humans and becomes like he was in ""Fear of a Bot Planet"" ...in the first season of the series. ..There's probably more.. shoot, basically everyone is out of character.. Maybe Zapp and Amy's parents aren't.

As for the general story.. it was incredibly dumb. The entire universe falling in love with a tentacle monster from a another universe just doesn't seem to make much sense.. and the fact that it was similar and referred to as Heaven when they all left was just plain.. strange.

As for the jokes.. if they weren't cheap callbacks from the series, they were just disgusting. Though it wasn't all bad, I did laugh at a few Zoidberg gags but that's pretty much it.

It was pretty disappointing. Maybe the writers should stick to their Math books rather than writing a dvd movie. After this debacle, I do not have much faith in the last 2 movies.",1214784000,2,1529,4.569343065693431
3376190,2,B00158K0V0,"I am a big Futurama fan from the first episode on.  I also really enjoyed Bender's Big Score, aside from it running slightly too long.

This movie drops the ball multiple levels.  There is practically no followup to the plot of BBS, the characters feel really off somehow, and the plot just felt like it dragged on and on.

In its defense, however, I will say that the first act started off fairly strong with a lot of laughs; after that, it just felt like the writers had no idea where to go, and the humor, character interaction, and plot just seemed to dry up.

You know there's a problem when you start checking the clock to see how much longer the movie is going to run.  But, hopefully, this is just a slight misstep in what otherwise is an incredibly fun show.",1214784000,5,767,4.328671328671328

It is more a bunch of jokes put together with no clear purpose and then put together in a hurry using a stupid plot. As far as I am concerned futurama was a ""real"" sitcom that just happened to be setup in the future which allowed for jokes that would otherwise be nonsensical in a different setting. Well if you are like me, who thinks the first 6~9 seasons of the simpsons were good until it just got to be a bunch of nonsense put together about the wacky adventures of Homer, well this is exactly what the beast with a billion backs is. It has no character interaction, the story does not flow, it just sucks (I am sorry to say).",1214784000,5,784,4.1644736842105265
3376192,3,B00158K0V0,"While I'm a truly devoted Futurama fan, I'm not one of those condescending supergeeks who claim to love Futurama so much that I have the authority to tell everyone else how virulently they're supposed to hate anything even slightly different than my favorite old episodes. (That's right, you heard me.) I'm ecstatic that Futurama has returned from the dead, and I totally loved ""Bender's Big Score."" But this new Futurama flick disappoints. Most of what we know and love about Futurama is still here in spades, but this flick suffers from a poorly-developed plot and a degeneration of the show's formerly deep and subversive humor.

The 88-minute format is either too long for a compact and focused plotline, or too short for the type of complex story the producers appear to be striving for. The story here jumps around at a very awkward pace and shows signs of severe over-editing. The jokes have been reduced to Family Guy-like asides played for cheap guffaws rather than deep thoughts. (The caped superhero is an unfortunate example, and Bender's firstborn son is a very unfortunate example.)

Many holes and inconsistencies in the storyline show that plot construction took a backseat to the more easily written sight gags and cheap asides. (Here's an example that hopefully won't be condemned as a spoiler. Late in the film the new Yivo character says he [sklee] sent an image of himself to artists in our universe, but most of the story is built on the idea that Yivo thought he was alone in all universes.) The fundamental story has also trumped the longstanding strengths of the show. The personalities of Fry and Leela (and important supporting characters like Kif) are inconsistent, Bender has been demoted to an unworkable subplot, and Zoidberg does little more than vomit for simpleminded laughs. There are also many missed opportunities for building upon the cliffhangers left from ""Bender's Big Score.""

You can rest assured that the great Futurama animation, music, and voice acting (the actors have always been the show's unsung heroes) won't disappoint this time around. But the writing will. Certain fans may or may not like the basic story, but the bigger point is that everyone will notice the careless and unprofessional defects in the story. Hopefully this flick will just be a temporary misstep. Console yourself by remembering once again how lucky we are to have Futurama back among the living.

Bad, bad, bad, BAD!!!!  I would have never thought I'd say it, but sadly the abrupt end of the series on a high note was a better end to Futurama than the garbage they've turned out in the direct to DVD features.

Overall, I did not enjoy this film as much as the first one, Bender's Big Score.  I did not find it nearly as witty, but the storyline was good and fun, and David Cross at Yivo shows that he is still hilarious.

The special features are good as well.  Unlike Bender's Big Score, there are not quite as many special features, but what they have is good stuff for the watching.

I recommend this film to any Futurama fan.  If you are a true fan, you will probably buy this no matter what I said anyway, I know that I was getting this DVD no matter what!  =)

Yivo, Deathball...

The second movie takes place right after the first with a rip into another universe.  It introduces us to Yivo (David Cross) as a planet with purple tentacles that wants to mate with earth because he was lonely.  There's a great sub plot with Bender joining the League of Robots.  And a C plot involving Kiff, Amy and Zapp Brannagin.  The features offer audio commentary, the movies from the XBOX and PS2 Game as well as Audio Commentary, a interview with David Cross the set up for the third movie (Which Will have a LOTR's Plot) a live blooper reel and deleted scenes.

3376198,3,B00158K0V0,"I remember when the first episode of Futurama aired on TV. I was in highschool. The show really grew on me, and throughout college, I grown to love the show. I was quite happy to see the show on Cartoon Network, and even more happy when the seasons made it to DVD. Needless to say, I enjoyed probably thousands of hours with Futurama. Recently, the makers decided it was time to re-air the show in the form of movies. I believe altogether, there will be four DVDs although I can't quite remember. The Beast with a Billion Backs is the second DVD released.

This DVD starts off where Bender's Big Score left off. The show starts off quite good, but when the movie ends, I felt somewhat disappointed. Normally, Futurama has a formula to it: the team - mainly Leela, Fry, and Bender with support from other members from time to time - work together to resolve some issue. In a Beast with a Billion Backs, the Futurama formula isn't quite there. The story takes a odd turn that it normally doesn't take. By the end of the film, I felt that the characters detached from one another. Like it felt great that it ended with everyone together, but throughout the movie, it felt like it detached some how. Can't really say much without spoiling it for newcomers though.

As a Futurama fan possibly talking to another Futurma fan, all I can say is that you should give this movie a shot. I felt the usual Futurama formula wasn't quite there; the characters felt detached somewhat. And on top of all the problems, the story doesn't settle quite well in the stomach.

In all, I think the movie was alright. Hopefully the next DVD release will follow the usual Futurama formula, but as it stands, this current DVD release felt somewhat out of place in the Futuram world.",1214611200,2,1756,4.515723270440252

As usual, Bender and Zoidberg were the best part. I'll watch it again because its Futurama, but really its not their best episode. I will say though that the ending was good (which is why I gave it a 3 instead of less).",1214611200,2,359,4.217391304347826
3376220,2,B00158K0V0,"It seems that there there are two distinctly different types of futurama fans. The first class hated Bender's Big Score (BBS) and seem to love Beast with a Billion Backs (BBB). I'm in the other group though. I thought BBS was terrific! I loved it. The same cannot be said for BBB. If you liked BBS, I predict you will not like this one.

One flaw is that everyone seems so out of character. Fry and Leela completely ignore each other throughout the movie and they apparently forgot about what happened in the last movie. It is quite frustrating to watch Fry and Leela having no interest in each other after all that has happened.

My biggest concern, however, is that Futurama is headed in the direction of Family Guy. You know what I mean if you've seen it, it is that crude, raunchy, disgusting sort of humor. I don't like it, I don't think it is funny, and I don't think that's what Futurama is all about! Futurama used to have a higher standard of humor.

I was excited to watch this and about the first 30 minutes are great, but it goes downhill quick. I actually fell asleep the first time I watch it about 45 minutes into the film. The second half just seems to drag on and on and on. I wish they would have just brought the TV show back. If this was a 20 minute episode it might have been good, but it certainly doesn't cut it as a full length movie.",1214611200,5,1358,4.255813953488372
3376221,4,B00158K0V0,"Following the excellent but not wholly successful ""Bender's Big Score"", we get the ""Beast with a Billion Backs,"" a radical change in focus and tone which could be described almost exactly the same way. Again, the fact that this is essentially four episodes stuck together means the tone swings wildly and the story sometimes meanders more than a little, but at the heart of it, ""BwaBB"" is chock full of great Futurama moments. It's (perhaps thankfully) a little less cameo-heavy than BBS, and Fry/Leela shippers may take exception to its easy dismissal of their angst (again, perhaps thankfully) but don't buy the hype that ""everyone is acting out of character."" Rather, we get to see a different side of some key characters, most notably an oddly dignified Fry and a unusually cynical Leela... but hey, a tear in the fabric of reality will bring out different things in people.

If there is anything surprising about ""BwaBB,"" it may be how strongly it drifts towards sci-fi fantasy in its story, concept, and execution. The laughs are still there, but the third act in particular plays out more like sci-fi horror than cheap comedy. The final act, including the bizzare moral (which at first seems like a throw-away gag, but actually fits nicely into the kind of sci-fi moral-bending we might get from the likes of Philip Jose Farmer) also has deep investments in its scifi/fantasy roots, to the point where it turns into a kind of surreal  meditation on the very meaning of love. It's bizzare, no doubt (and I think it threw a lot of viewers) but it's handled with spectacular deftness which allows it to be both slyly satirical and oddly touching at the same time. Actually, if the film has any serious problems, its that (without spoiling anything) a key event involving a major character and the aftermath of that event seem to not be treated with the gravity they deserve.  You can't ask us to invest in the characters, their stories, and their universe, and then simply shrug off important developements in the name of more jokes. Still, this is ultimately a fairly minor quibble, as  the film gradually ups the ante for all the major characters. Fans of Futurama who identify with the creators' true love of Sci-Fi will walk away very happy with this effort, although, of course, those who are just looking for cheap laughs may find a bit too much to think about.",1214611200,3,2371,4.775609756097561

Smeh.

The extras seem to be the usual fine assortment we've come to expect from both ""Futurama"" and ""The Simpsons"" DVDs, including commentary and lots of fun goodies, like the ""lost"" episode of ""Futurama"" (which seemed entertaining, though the CGI was basically unwatchable, at least to me).

**WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW!**

1. What the heck happened to continuity? Apparently Leela and Fry have completely forgotten about the Lars drama from the last movie and we're back at square one again (or, really, nothing at all). Fry is dating another woman, and Leela shows absolutely no emotion or any kind of jealous reaction towards it. So, the fact that Lars was Fry and you claimed he was the only man you'd ever love meant nothing?

2. And Fry, what about you? In Big Score you were desperate to win Leela's heart. After you broke up with Colleen I assumed you'd go right back to that, like always. No, it didn't even occur to you. You just put on a space suit and left the universe. If he's going to lose interest in Leela completely (and vice versa) at least tell us why, give us some backstory on it.

3. Despite the fact that Nibbler was freaking out at the end of Big Score, and there came a huge rift in the space-time continuum in the sky, it took them weeks before they even started to investigate it. I don't know, I should think a huge, potentially deadly hole in the sky should get top priority on the world's ""to fix"" list. Besides which, Leela didn't seem to care or notice that Nibbler had run away. Isn't he supposed to be her beloved, spoiled pet?

4. The whole ""lonely"" space monster who secretly mated with everyone on Earth literally behind their backs was... yeah. Then when people find out about what's really happening, he offers to be friends with them, woos them with candy and flowers, and then dates everyone at the same time? The heck?! That's not funny, that's just incredibly weird and skeezy :/

Granted, there was some really funny stuff in there, and I enjoyed it a lot for the first half hour or so, but towards the end I was actually Fast-Forwarding. I was all, ""Shouldn't it be done?"".

I'm not saying Futurama can't be too weird or too serious - they've done both in the past, and done it well (I still can't rewatch Jurassic Bark to this day).

If you're watching this expecting it to be exactly like the show, then you're going in with the wrong mindset. They have 4x the timespan to work with, so of course the pacing, flow, and plot will be a bit different. But with that in mind, it's really good.

The plot was seriously lacking, and the storyline wasn't strung together very well at all. In certain points I found myself thinking ""You mean there's still more? Shouldn't it be over?!"". Also, it seems like they've taken writing cues from the more recent seasons of ""The Simpsons"", many of the jokes were a bit over the top and at the same time low-brow. One of the things I love about Futurama is the creative and clever writing, the jokes that are a bit more clever, and not all physical comedy.

THis one on the other hand, The Beast With a Billion Backs, was freaking hilarious.  For the ones who didn't care for it stating that Futurama is some kind of ingenius amazing deep cartoon, you've got it completely wrong.  It's an adult cartoon meant to be funny and random.  Period.

I've read over some of the previous reviews extolling the outrageous humor, deep meaning, and (god help me, no pun intended) biblical parallels . . . and I'm afraid that I have to side with the minority and say that this latest effort felt like a half -hearted attempt to try and put a shiny Futurama wrapper on a mish-mash of storylines without direction that get slammed together at the end for an unsatisfying finish. I was so disappointed with this release that it moved me to write my very first review here on Amazon. My one . . . lonely moment of laughter was the guest appearance by Stephen Hawking. That at least justifies the one star rating.

The developments of ""Bender's Big Score"" are all but forgotten and almost every character is out of character. Not to mention the big payoff, the moral after 89 minutes is . . . love isn't really love without jealousy. The End. Wow. I realize that this particular story arc isn't trying to bury us in pointless humor, but when putting it up against previous stories like Jurassic Bark . . . the writing doesn't even compare.

Die hard fans will rave about this video and five star it all day long no matter what anyone says. Weak jokes, even weaker self-references, and a thin plotline lead me to recommend that regular fans of the series rent this and save themselves $16. For me, the true measure of how much I enjoyed this movie is that while I do and will continue to watch seasons 1-4 of the series over and over, I highly doubt this disc will ever come into contact with my DVD player again.

3376236,5,B00158K0V0,"Love has always been a topic of movies and TV, but ""Beast with a Billion Backs"" is one of the most encompassing and non-polemic explorations of the emotion I have ever seen.  It covers the entire gamut, from monogamous relationships to polyamorous ones, individual love to universal love, platonic love to erotic love, new love to loss.  And it humorously juxtaposes the cultural trappings of one kind to another to explore the ramifications of each.

It is pretty common to see TV shows that might tackle one of these, and either give a ""hey, isn't this great"" message (like most sit-coms) or a ""it looks good at first, but it isn't so great after all"" angle (like a Twilight Zone ""what looks like heaven is actually hell"").  Maybe that's all you can do in half an hour.  But this movie doesn't give an answer.  We see humanity (at least the Planet Express segment) individually achieve love, and have a couple of chances for universal love by different means, and by the end things end up shattered.  We end up puzzling the issue of what is best ourselves, with some new brilliant insights we had not thought of before.

And I find it surprising that people claim the movie is terrible because it isn't funny.  It seems like they have not seen the show recently, and misremember how it actually was.  Go back to the original series, especially the third and fourth seasons, and see how many jokes there really were.  Humor is not the show's reason for being, it is the wrapper for philosophical and character explorations, just as in most sci-fi.  But don't think this movie isn't funny as well, because it is.  If you thought ""The Sting"" was one of the high-points of the series, and ended up crying at the end of ""Jurassic Bark"", I am certain you will enjoy this movie.",1214352000,15,1773,4.59047619047619
3376237,4,B00158K0V0,"While I enjoyed Bender's Big Score, I felt like the effort was a bit shaky, as no doubt Team Futurama was a little out of practice after their run on Fox ended.

Beast With a Billion Backs wastes no time on exposition and jumps right into rapid-fire and over-the-top gags that actually achieve the big laughs Bender's Big Score failed to deliver.  While the first movie focused on the emotional interplay between Fry and Leela, and storytelling in general, this installment forgoes all of that in favor of jokes and insanity.  Some might find this shallow, but not every episode can be Jurassic Bark (nor should it be).  I personally found this approach refreshing, and felt more like I was watching Futurama and not an homage to it (Big Score).

That being said, there is a (long, winding, bizarre) storyline, and it keeps up the Futurama tradition of brain-bending science fiction twists on sitcom plots.  It's essentially a love story, but it involves multiple dimensions and a being as big as a planet.  I won't go into detail, but it gets pretty weird.  In fact, in places it's downright sinister and creepy, which is new territory for Futurama.  However, I applaud them for experimenting, especially since they really succeeded in acheiving a palpable sense of claustrophobic tension during these scenes.

Due to the fact that this ""movie"" is actually set to be sliced up into 4 individual episodes for air on Comedy Central, the plot doesn't necessarily feel like 1 movie all the way through.  You can distinctly sense a few different acts, which sometimes feel like they have little to do with what preceded them.  This is the only problem I have with the film, but I have a hard time being upset about it.  The overall zaniness and fun of it, the hit ratio of the jokes, and the originality of the plot make this a solid investment to me.

Can't wait for Bender's Game!",1214352000,4,1878,4.703363914373089
3376238,3,B00158K0V0,"I bought this on the day of release, so of course I'm a big Futurama fan and expected to like it. I thought Bender's Big Score was a decent effort showing some rust, so to speak, and that the new releases would get better from there. This one is a letdown, though. No doubt, there are some good jokes, and I laughed here and there during the 90 minutes. But the writing really doesn't feel like Futurama. The grossout and mildly sick humor is amped up (it was always there but balanced with the show's sophisticated writing), and in particular, some of the humor that plays on the film's ""rape"" plot has a slightly ugly edge. There's also a lengthy subplot with Calculon that really drags down the film while offering almost no laughs.

The special features are pretty weak too. The deleted scenes reel is very short, the ""blooper"" section is just 2 minutes of the voice actors mugging for the video cameras (though this guy is happy to look at Tress McNeill and Katey Segal), and the full-length ""episode"" created for a video game just doesn't have the laughs.

Bottom line: I eagerly awaited this and bought it day of release; I won't be in such a hurry for the next one (which doesn't look so hot, based on the preview included with this one).",1214352000,41,1246,4.484581497797357
3376258,5,B00158K0V0,"After seeing the first Futurama dvd, i was a bit dissapointed. This movie definitely tops the first, at least in my opinion.

The characters were in situations similar to those we would see on the show and the writers show the characters as thier funny selves again. They also show all the favorite characters on the show, which is a plus.

If you are a Futurama fan, you will not be dissapointed with this movie.",1214352000,2,413,4.493333333333333
3376259,2,B00158K0V0,"I was disappointed, it could have been funnier but the story was a touch weak, the jokes a bit worn.",1214352000,7,100,4.05
3376260,4,B00158K0V0,"So, reading some of the early reviews here and at various Futurama sites, I was feeling a bit apprehensive, as there was definitely a lot of mixed opinions about the quality of this one.  So, perhaps my expectations were set low initially, but this movie has managed to immediately find a place in my futurama heart.

For reference sake, my favorite Futurama TV episodes are, among others, 300 Big Boys, Jurassic Bark, I Dated a Robot, Parasites Lost, and Why Must I be a Crustacean in Love.  If you were a fan of these, you probably will have a similar ultimate conclusion about this movie.  It's interesting to note that Eric Kaplan had writing credits for all of these episodes and also with Beast with a Billion Backs (BBB), so I guess it's no surprise I ended up liking BBB, too.

I won't bore you with a plot synopsis (there are plenty of other sources for that), so I'll simply lay out a few points.  The characterestics that gave strength to my favorite futurama tv episodes are present here:  a thorougly interesting/creative story, an emotional edge, and fun character interactions.  The pace in BBB meanders compared to Bender's Big Score (BBS)'s rapid joke-firing rate, but that's a strength - it lets the circumstances breathe and really build upon itself (plus there isn't the same insane degree of massive cascading amounts of in-jokes and sly references).  Moreover, compared to BBS, the divisions for marking where this movie will eventually be split into 4 20-minute TV episodes for syndication are alot clearer - there's a definite mood shift for each of the four acts.  However, this effectively episodic nature actually tends to work to its strength, as it lets the writing cover a wide array of topics and themes.

For example, in the early acts with the onset of the massive tentacle beast, I was genuinely drawn in with a degree of suspense that I hadn't ever had before with a Futurama episode or really any animated cartoon.  But later on, the episodic shifts allowed for me to readily enter the more ponderous, introspective last act with little reservation or guard.  Unfortunately though, this episodic nature means that the ending is somewhat anticlimactic - I'm curious to see how it would work on TV since I believe it would be better at the end of a 20 minute episode than an 80 minute movie.  It also means that you'll have a bit of a weird, sinusoidal story arc that builds and detentes several times over the course of the movie, but for the most part I'm pleased with the net result.  Again - suspenseful build up, humorous interim (not to mention the pretty amusing side plot with Bender in the League of Robots), and an almost uncharacteristically contemplative last chapter (where Leela, in a bit of almost genius writing expresses, in a sort of breaking-the-4th-wall post-modern manner, the movie viewer's initial reservation and then acceptance of the situations at hand).

That being said, I can easily see why some Futurama diehards are eager to write this off as worst. episode. ever.  It's fairly raunchy (though I don't see the sexual imagery that some have seen in the Beast and honestly think people who do see that kind of subliminal imagery need to get out more), a bit fearless in making quick, transient changes to the Futurama universe, and really pushes the envelop in the kind of story Futurama can tell (in the sort of way Jurassic Bark or 300 Big Boys did, just in a very different direction); at times the mood can get overly haunting/eerie/cruel.  Plus, Fry and Leela aren't together, which I'm sure is frustrating many a diehard, but I don't see it as any less consistent with how the normal Futurama series treated their relationship.

Overall though, I definitely liked this more than Bender's Big Score - it's fresh, inventive, and (though I didn't discuss it at length) has amazing art direction.  Brittany Murphy and David Cross do a fine job and Stephen Hawking steals his scenes shamelessly well.  I would easily put it amongst the better Futurama episodes, even if it has some noticable flaws.",1214352000,3,4062,4.799139167862267
3376261,2,B00158K0V0,"I'm not sure if this is going to be another ""That's Lobstertainment"", which took a few years and several viewings to grow on me, or not.

While the animation was top notch, the story, what there was of it, relied too much on gross outs and rehashing.  It felt like I was watching a combination of brain slugs and Bender's sour relationship with Planet Express Ship that went on for eons too long.

I'll admit, there were funny bits, but there just wasn't enough to keep me interested, especially with Emo! Fry.

I should have saved my money.",1214352000,5,541,4.489795918367347
3376262,1,B00158K0V0,"This is terrible.  There are a few good jokes, but for the most part it isn't funny.  Bender's Big Score was well written; it was funny and sweet and clever.  This latest Futurama lacks all the qualities that made the first movie and the show enjoyable.

I usually give a synopsis of the story of a movie or book in my reviews.  I don't see much point in trying to provide such a summary in this review.  The movie interweaves several different story lines together (Bender and the league of robots, Fry and his new girlfriend, the Universe and Yivo) and none of it is done well.  What happened to Fry's feelings for Leela?  Why does the movie switch from a scifi monster flick to bad chick lit?  How could anyone write something as boring as this movie?

The packaging for the DVD is terrible and makes the DVD prone to scratches prior to ever even opening the case.

I bought this without having seen it because of my love of the show and my love of Bender's big score.  For any future Futurama products I am going to have to rent them first before I choose to own them.  I highly recommend that other fans of the series rent this one before committing to purchasing it.  Beast with a Billion Backs is a big bust.",1214265600,15,1215,4.31858407079646
3376263,5,B00158K0V0,"It's a B+ episode of Futurama at best, but that's still enough (in my mind) to get 5 stars relative to other offerings.

3376264,3,B00158K0V0,"It's all well and good for Fox to want to be green, but their carbon neutral packaging of this DVD is even cheaper and flimsier then it was for Bender's Big Score.  In attempting to get the plastic off the DVD case, it nearly folded in half on me since it's made out of cheap, thin cardboard.  Also, there's no plastic spindle in the middle of the DVD case, just a slot in the cheap cardboard and my DVD came scratched up already because of that.  It still plays but how cheap can Fox be?  The movie was fun but I just can't get past the DVD box.  It's just terribly cheap.",1214265600,6,573,4.080357142857143
3376265,2,B00158K0V0,"And by that I mean that while all the one-off jokes work (hell, many of them are downright hilarious!), they have little of the plot- and character-relevance that made Futurama such a great series.  And for the record, I really liked ""Bender's Big Score"".  It was FUN ON A BUN.

In fact, this film's plot itself ventures into a genre that I'd much rather have seen Futurama stay at two removes from: romantic comedy.  Except this time it's all the inhabitants of our universe (""Universe Gamma"") in a romantic comedy with a planet-sized tentacled monster from another universe.  There's a Bender sideplot that serves absolutely no purpose except to give Bender screen time and ultimately give him a reason to basically undo everything that happened in the movie, just when one would expect a perfectly Futurama-style twistedly happy ending.

Speaking of undoing things that happened, I really must complain that this film literally resets the past eight years of Futurama continuity.  Since the Niblonians and Brainspawn are no longer in Universe Gamma and every single romantic relationship has been reset to a basic state of ""not existing"", it really appears as though the writers behaved exactly like a dog encountering a chess board: knocking every piece out of its place with no real character development just so they could put them into the absurd places their canine brains desired.

Finally, it has come to my attention that a lot of people got a lot more out of this film by reading it as a portrayal of the events described by the Book of the Revelation of John (aka: the Book of Revelations, aka: that crazy Apocalypse thing).  Despite my knowledge of the story, being a Jew I guess I just can't see the parallels.  You can only see them after someone else tells you about them, which means they aren't really there.",1214265600,26,1827,4.826923076923077

The only thing I disliked was that there was no romance between Leela and Fry, but you never know what will happen in other movies. Overall, this is one movie I am prepared to watch again and again.

3376280,5,B00158K0V0,"Although Matt Groening will forever be remembered for his creation of the Simpsons and the total hysteria that still surrounds what many will agree has become a very bad attempt at comedy. Futurama, however, is something truly unique and has the potential to become Matt Groenings best creation especially when it comes to longevity as the mere setting of the show gives it the potential to be truly unique on a constant basis as the creators can truly go wild with the stories. Going wild is something they really have done with this movie as it's something that you feel is truly bizarre even for a comedy like Futurama. The story starts off with how the last movie finished with a big tear in the universe and nobody having a single idea about what it was.

At the start we're introduced to the gang in all their glory but we learn that Kif and Amy are having a FonFon Rubok (Wedding) and Fry has a new Girlfriend called Colleen, but there's one problem with Colleen and that's she has 5 other boyfriends. Bender has his role in this movie as after the first attempt to pass through the universal tear and injuring himself in the process, he gets the chance to meet Calculon in hospital and decides he wants to be Calculons official stalker, which leads him into the dark underworld of the League of Robots. Through the movie after Fry breaks up with Colleen he votes himself to enter the rift to explore just exactly what it is that's in the alternate universe, we come to find that it's a huge squid monster names Yivo and it enters on a quest to invade our universe.

This is a really good movie and much, much better than the first. The Futurama movies were only made with the intention of being split into episodes for a new season to eventually begin on Comedy Central. They don't seem to look like 3 or 4 episodes put into one long movie. Instead they simply appear as intended and that's a damn good movie. It's filled with some of the best one liners I've heard on an animated show of this kind and one of the best lines were by the character Yivo ""It burns like my gonorrhoea."" This line had me in absolute stitches at the sheer unexpected value of it, this is what makes Futurama so special as it has some of the most creative writing you can imagine. It's not shocking for shocks sake like Family Guy, and it's not ridiculous try hard humour like the current Simpsons seasons it's simply witty comedy that has you roaring with laughter at the genuine wit of the writing.

This and Benders Big Score should be added to your DVD collections along with the upcoming Futurama movies which I can imagine to be just as special.",1214006400,3,2636,4.464730290456432
