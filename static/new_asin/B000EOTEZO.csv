8112084,1,B000EOTEZO,I found it interesting for a while then it was just so. Now I joined a gym and the music and the classes are always changing,1392681600,,124,3.8076923076923075
8112085,4,B000EOTEZO,Great dvd for beginner and moderate spin cyclists.  She instructs those who are new to spinning with detailed information that is important for any cyclist. Good workout throughout the dvd.  It's challenging and fun.,1299715200,,216,5.323529411764706
8112086,5,B000EOTEZO,"I love this program.  Mindy Mylrea is by far my favorite spinning instructor.  I have bought every spinning DVD I could find by her.  Her videos far excel what is on the market for spinning.  She makes spinning fun, challenging and you really feel energized and good about yourself at the end of the program.  She also breaks it up into sections so you can do the entire video or mix and match.  The best spinning work out you can find in my opinion.",1276300800,,450,4.2976190476190474
8112087,5,B000EOTEZO,I'm not bored by it and its a good way to push you.  She's very easy to understand. 2 workout levels,1235433600,,100,3.761904761904762
8112088,2,B000EOTEZO,After reading the great reviews on Mindy Mylrea I was anticipating a really great ride.  I was disappointed and found the DVD boring.  Mindy and the music were boring.  I'll stick to my classes at the YMCA.,1229040000,,206,4.513513513513513
8112089,5,B000EOTEZO,"I am new to indoor cycling and wanted a challenging yet manageable DVD.
This DVD is great for beginners and offers a tough yet rewarding workout.
Mindy Mylrea does a great job keeping you motivated and smiling during this ""ride"". This has become my favorite go-to DVD.",1207180800,5,268,4.723404255319149
8112090,2,B000EOTEZO,"Ms. Mylrea's DVD appears solid from a technical standpoint. She seems well trained and certified and takes a gradual approach that includes setting up your bike and cycling through various stages accordingly to your fitness level.

However, this DVD did not motivate or inspire me to cycle. Part of the problem are her put-downs to her male riding partner. His bike is off to the side of the screen and for some reason, he isn't allowed to speak. We know that she's front and center and these one-liners are unnecessary.

I returned this piece to amazon a week after receipt.",1203811200,2,575,4.74
8112091,5,B000EOTEZO,I have been working out with this dvd for about 1 year now with nothing but praise for it. It's a safe and effective workout. She is educational and motivational without being irritating or smarmy. It has really helped me refocus my workout on zone/heart reate training. I now realize it's the only way to train. You can make this as hard or easy as you want. There'a bonus section that is an excellent addition. I just wish she made another one to mix in. Totally recommend this exercise dvd. I have a Lemond Revmaster and it's a perfect match with the dvd.,1195862400,12,558,4.427184466019417
8112092,5,B000EOTEZO,"Love,Love, Love this dvd!!!! Bought a LaMond Revmaster and this dvd. She's motivating, but not annoying. I've been using it since Jan 3-4 days a week (21/2 months) Still love it!!! Highly recommend!",1173312000,6,198,5.03030303030303
8112093,4,B000EOTEZO,Great workout. Made for the serious rider.  Inspiring. Bubbly personality.,1140825600,6,74,6.4
