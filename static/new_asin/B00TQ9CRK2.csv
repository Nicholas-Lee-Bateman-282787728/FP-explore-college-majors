8702728,5,B00TQ9CRK2,"I went into this expecting a children's movie but this is a wonderful film for adults and children alike. A wonderful adventure through time from pirates to a more modern tale taking place in the 1950s that links up with the past. This film does have some mild language and violence, not much, so some parents may not want their kids watching it with them.",1473552000,2,356,4.492307692307692
8702729,5,B00TQ9CRK2,We love this movie. I had to purchase so we could watch it when ever we want. Movie for the entire family.,1470355200,,106,3.8636363636363638
