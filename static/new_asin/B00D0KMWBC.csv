8588232,5,B00D0KMWBC,"I greatly admired the courage displayed by the journalists in the film in the face of intense harassment (inferring from the end of film statements this had some correspondence to real situations). While maybe not a great film cinematicaly, it struck me as a forthright and convincing portrayal of courage, commitment, perseverance and resourcefulness. The film serves to remind us of the importance of free speech, its vulnerability to the abuse of power and the callousness that those power wielders are sometimes capable of. All of which makes it a valuable offering on the state of our world.",1424908800,,596,5.091836734693878
