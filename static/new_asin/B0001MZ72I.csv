This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1401,4.279245283018868
8014905,5,B0001MZ72I,"This is one of the coolest DVD's in Yu Yu Hakusho history.  I never thought Togouro would return.  Oh well.  At least Kurama killed him with the sinning tree.  This is one of my first reviews, so I really don't expect to much out of this one.  I thought that getting the edited versions would be a lot better for kids and I am more used to them because like a few of you, I found out about this on Cartoon Network.  I used to not care for this when someone else got me into this stuff which lead me 2 like Gundam Seed, DBGT, DBZ, Last Exile, Rurouni kenshin, Zoids Fuzors, rave Master, Robotech, .Hack, and this too.  This DVD contains the beggining of the fight between Yusuke and Sensui.  The fight between Game Master and Kurama ends.  The fight between Togouro and Kurama is in one episode.  Kuwabara finally gets released.  I was surprised that Itsuki didn't kill Hieh, Kuwabara, Kurama, Matari,.  This is all I will say so far.  And that I intend on getting a little more active with this stuff",1104364800,2,1000,4.34054054054054
8014906,5,B0001MZ72I,"In this DVD, Yuske and Sensui Clash in a fight to stope the tunnel between the worlds.  To me, the character to keep an eye on would be either Kurama or Yuske.  I was hoping that Yoko would return but they run into an old rival (Hence the DVD title)that Kurama has to deal with and knew he was present in another one of ""the seven"" psychics in the area.  Keep an eye on the fight between Yuske and Sensui, It is like a roller coaster, one turn after another in this DVD. I can't wait for the next DVD ""In the Blood.""",1092355200,,516,3.9902912621359223
8014907,5,B0001MZ72I,"This DVD begins Yusuke's climactic battle with Sensui. Oh, please note that what is on the cover actually doesn't happen until the next DVD, In the Blood. But I really don't care, because the cover looks good like this.
In the episode Game Over, Kurama steps up to play against the Game Master. Kurama tells the young Game Master the full extent of Sensui's plan, that if Kurama wins, he will die. Just like the Goblin King does in the game. Game Master is losing his nerve. He starts to remember the night he met Sensui. ""I don't wanna die,"" he keeps repeating. The game ends...
In the episode Kurama's Anger, Gourmet's Guest, Yusuke and his ""team"" make it to Sensui's lair. Before they can fight Sensui, Gourmet steps up to fight, using Elder Toguro's powers (this is not a spoiler, it was revealed in the DVD 'Dangerous Games'). Kurama steps up to vent off his anger. An old enemy resurfaces, and Kurama unveils a deadly new attack.
In the episode Spirit Detective Showdown, Yusuke begins his fight with Sensui. Old detective vs. New detective. Amidst this fight for the entire human race, Yusuke still has the nerve to throw smart-alleck comments around left and right. This episode is truly great and blends some of the best action I've ever seen in this series with humor.
In the episode The Difference Maker, we learn more about Sensui: His 7 personalities. Sensui created them subconsciously to help him cope with what he saw in the infiltration of the Black Black Club's demon trading. When Yusuke gets the upper hand, one of the personalities surfaces. He is called Kazuya, and is a sadist. Kazuya has his own special attack, he can turn his right arm into a gun barrel. He shoots Yusuke in the chest. While Yusuke is on the ground in pain, Kazuya continues to shoot him in various body parts. He desides it's time to end the fight. Kazuya has the gun at Yusuke's throat. Then, Koenma appears...",1088467200,8,1905,4.6390532544378695
