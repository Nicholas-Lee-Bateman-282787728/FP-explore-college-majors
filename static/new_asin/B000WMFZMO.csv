8224225,5,B000WMFZMO,Love it.  Added to my library and hope one day my daughter will read it even if she does not like sports.  There is a message in it on racism and stereotyping and other problems in America or the USA.,1385769600,,200,3.975
8224226,5,B000WMFZMO,"For any football fan, this is worth watching. Racism in pro sports has garnered headlines again recently in the world of professional soccer.
We can chose to ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist but it isn't going to go away. This documentary shows that progress has been made, however incrementally as far as black athletes playing
the position of QB in the NFL. It really wasn't all that  long ago that a  statement like "" blacks just aren't smart enough to play QB""  was accepted by many.
Hopefully as a nation we have moved past sending death threats to black QB's and are willing to judge an athlete ""not by the color of their skin, but the content of their character.""

ESPN has done a very fine job with this and other documentaries. I hope they keep up the good work going forward.",1325116800,,790,4.465277777777778
8224227,5,B000WMFZMO,"This is definitely a piece of NFL history that needs to be told.  They did forget one QB though:  Eldridge Reno Dickey (b. 24 December 1945 d. 22 May 2000) was an American football player. After playing for Tennessee State University from 1965-1968, he was drafted in 1968 by the Oakland Raiders in the 1st round as the 25th overall pick

8224228,5,B000WMFZMO,"I am a woman who loves football! High school, college, pro, Pop Warner, you get the picture. I have Steve McNair to thank for that. Seasons 1991-1994 at Alcorn State University were the most thrilling and historic. One of the condensed games on this DVD shows Alcorn vs. Southern University when Steve McNair broke Ty Detmer's NCAA total offense record. Great segment. I was there! Watching that segment brings back all of the emotions of that game. The ability to re-live Steve McNair out there scrambling, making passes and making history at my alma mater, Alcorn State University, brings me to tears. Not tears of sadness but tears of joy. He was a great athlete and Miss Lucille's son. Gone too soon.

Though I have yet to watch the other condensed games and interviews, I can still say that this DVD is a must-have for any football fan, especially from the historical stand point of the Black Quarterback.

I wish there were more like this. I would love to see a full DVD of Steve McNair's collegiate games in this condensed format. Get busy producers!",1247356800,,1057,4.708108108108108
8224229,5,B000WMFZMO,"These stories about the struggles of the the black athlete to have the opportunity to play Quarterback at the highest level are a part of history that needs to be told. The stereotypes illustrated in this DVD still exist today in the minds of many and both at the college and the NFL levels of play. The inspirational stories of how some of these men were able to overcome these stereotypes gave my son the courage to turn down offers to play football at several prestigious universities if he switched positions. Of the many schools interested in him, only three schools were willing to give him the opportunity to play Quarterback and he is at one of those schools now receiving a quality education and at the same time having the opportunity to fulfill his dream of playing Quarterback. I attribute the stories told in this DVD with opening my son's eyes and giving him the courage to go for his dream.",1238976000,3,905,4.592592592592593
8224230,5,B000WMFZMO,"This is an excellent movie, until now the Black Quarterback was an invisible, underrated player. Doug Williams hasn't received his proper respect to date. There should be updates to this movie, because there is more to Black Quarterbacks that over shadows their legal matters.

Doug Williams, Super Bowl performance was history making because it was record setting, not because he was black. Both Warren Moon and Doug Williams should be in the NFL Hall Of Fame.",1237420800,2,461,5.065789473684211
