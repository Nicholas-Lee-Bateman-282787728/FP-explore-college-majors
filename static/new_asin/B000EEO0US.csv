8108805,5,B000EEO0US,I try to use the warm up to yoga every day if possible. I love this although it is a bit slow and in some spots I add some exercise reps while the tape does three. I wish it were on DVD. Have had to keep our VCR just to play this tape!,1429660800,,235,3.452830188679245
8108806,5,B000EEO0US,"The Easy Yoga for Seniors  is excellent!  Instructions are clear and easy to follow. They are presented slowly enough for you to keep up.  It is very easy to modify the positions, if needed.",1419552000,,190,4.529411764705882
8108807,5,B000EEO0US,"I have been doing this yoga for 17 years. My tape wore out. I was afraid I couldn't find it any more. I had a massive heart attack 17 yrs ago. They said I wouldn't survive. With a lifestyle change and this yoga tape, I am the best I can be with only 1/4 of my heart working. I feel & look great!!",1386374400,2,296,3.7142857142857144

8108810,4,B000EEO0US,"Supposed to be easy yoga for seniors. But it's pretty much the same as my medium-difficult yoga class, although admittedly paced slower. I bought it for my husband who needs chair yoga but we haven't found any chair exercises yet and we're 45 minutes into the tape...",1291507200,,267,4.702127659574468
8108811,5,B000EEO0US,"I have a degree in Health and have been searching all types of dvds, tapes, you name it for a practical, safe and enjoyable dvd for seniors.  I have found it!! It is wonderful!  It is done with the senior citizen in mind. The oral instructions are slow enough yet clear as to what to do, how to do it, and finishes up with a calming, glowing treatment. I am 78 years old and could follow every instruction completely.  I even enjoyed doing them.  Most are to technical, instructors seemingly cold and harsh to the people they are instruction.  Not Pat, she was wonderful. Thank you....evao219@aoil.com",1241395200,8,601,4.632075471698113
