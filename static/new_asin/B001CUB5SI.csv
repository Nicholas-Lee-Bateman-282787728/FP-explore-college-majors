It began with the Ford Motor Company's attempt to buy Ferrari out. Enzo Ferrari had tentatively agreed, but the deal fell through because Ferrari didn't want to have to race at Indy! So, Henry Ford II said, ""Okay, beat them."" The DVD then traces the efforts by Ford to create a ""Ferrari killer"" to be raced in Europe - especially at Le Mans.

The GT-40 was a blend of Ford-Europe expertise and chassis combined with American engines. There were a lot of teething troubles as one can expect from a new racer. The project received a boost from Carroll Shelby's presence and expertise as they began the assault on Ferrari. Ford was determined to one-up Ferrari for the perceived slight and money was no object.

The DVD does a good job of showing the changes and modifications made to the GT-40 in order to make it a winner at Le Mans and the time and effort it required to make an American car dominate European racing. Five stars.",1448582400,,1105,4.570707070707071
