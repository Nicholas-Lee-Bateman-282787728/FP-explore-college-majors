There are four 30 minute shows.  #1 ""Little Old Lady""; the boys try to help evicted mrs. Gillicuddy.  #2 ""Bank Holdup""; the boys become unwitting accomplices in a holdup.  #3""Dentist Office""; some hilarious slapstick in a dentist office.  #4""Fencing Master""; lou challanges the fencing ace upstairs to a duel.",1069632000,8,428,5.130434782608695
