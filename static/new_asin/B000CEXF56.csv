2461082,3,B000CEXF56,"Someone said ""guilty pleasure"" -- yes, that's how I feel, too.  Not a great work of art, but some great moments.  Biggest downside: I didn't feel Jaclyn Smith portrayed Faye as a strong enough woman to be the ""first female director"" (never saw the iron hand under the velvet glove).

Upside for her: She's great with the sensitive moment.  The scenes where she changes her mind about taking Ward back, at the Santa Barbara house, are understated and beautifully played.  Michael Ontkean was believable from young man to grandfather -- even if Ward's role in the story was more facilitator of plot progression than actual character.

Some of the best scenes: Big brother Lionel with a very young Anne at Christmas.  Shy Lionel when he first encounters Paul.  Nervous Lionel telling Faye that he's gay.  Terrified Lionel when Ward finds him with his boyfriend.  Resolute Lionel with Ward in the kitchen at Greg's funeral.  Big brother Lionel with his funny but oh, such bad timing comment on Val's dress for the Oscars.  Delighted Lionel when he & John arrive at the Santa Barbara house to surprise Faye.  Devastated Lionel in the hospital with Faye & Ward.  Gentle Lionel approaching Paul again.  All done with the light Flanigan touch - no unnecessary histrionics there, just pure and true emotion.  Whenever he came on screen, the other actors seemed to ramp up for some of the best scenes of the movie.  He had a chemistry with each actor that seemed to challenge them to give a bit more, that put a little extra believability into their relationships.

The actresses that played Anne & Val were good, especially as they got older.  I particularly liked Val's goodbye to her leading man after he dropped her off one night.  Great chemistry, great moment.  And Anne did a great job as the quiet child, with a fantastic moment in the garden with Faye towards the end.  So much feeling in just a gaze!  The casting director chose wisely, finding actors who could play younger than themselves as well as older -- I didn't feel the need for ""suspension of disbelief.""

The story itself had some holes where I felt like some important things had been left out, but hey, it was pretty long as it was.  And now I'm off to read the book.

Overall, I'd recommend borrowing it if you want a good ""movie of the week"" chick flick ... and buy it if you are a fan of any of the actors.  As a ""great movie"" I have to give it 3 stars, but for pure indulgence?  Go for it.",1225324800,4,2456,4.558352402745996
2461083,5,B000CEXF56,This is a beautifully presented movie version of this great book.  This video is a repeat performer in our household...we enjoy it more each time we see it.,1222732800,,156,4.571428571428571
2461084,4,B000CEXF56,"For some reason, I really do like this mini-series show.  It's really touching and it's kind of like a guilty pleasure.  I just have to view this every once in a while -- and I enjoy it!!!",1173312000,,188,4.054054054054054
2461085,3,B000CEXF56,"I admit I initially watched it to see a younger (and absolutely luscious) Joe Flanigan.  I'm a bit of a science fiction/fantasy buff, and ""chick flicks"" are just not my thing.

But I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was actually... not all that bad.  I related to the younger brother when he went off to war, and sympathized with the mother and the other children when they found out he was killed in action (KIA).

There are spots when I just ho-hummed in regards to the plot: although I knew going in that this was a film that spanned the creation and existence of a family right until the wife/mother died, there were parts of it that just draaaaaaaaaagged.  Those were the times I got up and made myself a cup of tea, or went to the bathroom.  ;)

But the one scene in the movie that really stuck with me after all this time was when Ward (the father) figured out his eldest son, Lionel, was gay.  The ensuing confrontation was absolutely spellbinding.  If for nothing else, watch this movie for Joe Flanigan's wonderfully passionate and intriguing performance.  He is a true artist and a joy to watch working his craft.",1173052800,6,1132,4.532019704433497
2461086,3,B000CEXF56,"This movie is pretty crappy. Wait, make that INSANELY crappy. I saw this on Lifetime years ago and I finally bought it a month ago. Ask me why. Go ahead, ask me. It's because Joe (Lionel) is the cutest thing ever. And he takes off his shirt. Exposing his chest hair. Yes, Joe Flanigan is so cute in this film he makes me forget my grammar skills. It's totally worth a couple bucks.",1141084800,13,381,4.232876712328767
2461087,3,B000CEXF56,"Just an FYI for those who have never seen this movie. The couple meet during WWII and fall in love. She is a movie star and soon becomes a director. Her husband is a serial adulterer and the ridiculous part is that she keeps taking him back even though she knows what he is like. The movie spans their life together including their children. One son, the favorite, is killed. The second son is gay and has to deal with his parents' disapproval. The oldest daughter is so desperate to make her mark in the movies, that she will play the sluttest parts imaginable to do it. It is only when her parents give her a chance as a strong, lead character in one of their movies that she begins to believe in her talent. (She also clashes with her co-star..you fill in the blanks.) Lastly, there is the youngest daughter. She runs away when she is in her early teens and comes home, pregnant. Her parents convince her that giving the baby up for adoption is the only solution. She deals with her resentment and falls in love with one of her best friend's father. (At least 30 yrs older than her.)

Like I said, it's an Ok movie, but not one of Danielle Steel's best. I would highly recommend DS's Palomino, Message From Nam, or Once in a Lifetime.",1139443200,14,1237,4.354978354978355
2461088,5,B000CEXF56,"I'm thrilled that Danielle Steel's: Family Album, is finally available on dvd in the U.S.

You will share in the emotions of this family's struggle to remain together through many of lifes obstacles.",1138838400,6,199,5.03030303030303
2461089,5,B000CEXF56,"I first saw this movie when I was in high school and it came out on NBC about eleven years ago - it was absolutely mesmerizing and has stayed with me all these years later.  While it differed slightly from the book, which I later read, the passionate plot and subplots were pretty similar in both, and Michael Ontkean and Jacqueline Smith are superb in bringing the story of Ward and Faye Thayer to life.

I'd actually tried to purchase the DVD about a year or so ago from an e-Bay seller living in the UK, where it's been available, and it never arrived, so I am excited it's FINALLY coming out on DVD in the U.S.  I just can't speak highly enough about it!",1134691200,7,658,4.248

2461282,5,B000CEXF56,"I like the movie very much when Faye Price Thayer was an actress and then a director along with her husband Ward. I did not like it when he was unfaithful to her twice and also because he kicked his son Lionel out of his life because he was gay and also when Anne runs away from home because of what her father has done to her brother and also was pregnant and a high school drop out at the age of 15 and also had to give her child up for adoption, Valerie did a slasher film and became jealous of her mother because of her success. However, I'm glad Faye and Ward are back together as husband and wife during their trip to Santa Barbara on Spring break and also sad when Greg died in Vietnam and also John dies in a car accident and Faye dies of a heart attack. Also Anne spends a lot of time at her best friend's house because of problems with her family and also falls in love with Bill O' Hara which is her best friend's father. I also like it when Ward has end his fling with his mistress and also when he and Faye have made passionate love to each other and also moves back home and also welcome Lionel and his friend John back into their lives. The tragic part was sad when Greg dies in the war in Vietnam. Also when Faye has won the emmy for her work. Three of my favorite celebrities are in this film which are Jaclyn Smith, Michael Ontkean and Joe Flanigan",1374796800,2,1366,4.062962962962963
