8549901,5,B0097BDK28,"A beautiful movie depicting a young Iranian Muslim boy, Rahmon, who delivers milk daily to village neighbors.  His father is harsh, his grandmother kindly and more understanding.  The boy's mother died at his birth and he longs for a mother's love.  In his daily rounds he befriends an old Catholic priest and helps him with chores, but his father doesn't approve.  One day the boy asks the old priest about the picture of Holy Maryam in the church, and the priest tells the boy all mothers are like her, and that he once knew the boy's mother.  Rahmon answers, since his mother's name was Maryam, she must have looked like the picture of Holy Maryam in the church, and the priest nods in agreement.  When the old priest suffers a bad fall, the young boy helps him, nurses him, and eventually goes himself to another town some distance away, with his grandmother's blessing and a lunch she packs for his journey, to bring the priest's brother to help.  The boy's kindness and steadfastness are beautiful lessons and his journey's events so moving.  In the end the old priest dies, but leaves a picture of Holy Maryam with the words ""To my friend Rahmon, Son of Maryam"", together with a picture of him and the little boy.  And as an added blessing, you see mourners in procession for the priest, and the boy's father is among them.  There is very much more to the story, and is a sweet tribute to the understanding between different people despite their beliefs - that we are all children of one Father.",1356393600,,1502,4.591760299625468
