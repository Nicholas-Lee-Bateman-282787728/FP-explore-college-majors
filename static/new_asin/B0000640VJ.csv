1698038,4,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums is sort of the archetype of quirky films.  Strong performances by (especially) Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, Gwyneth Paltrow and the Wilson Brothers, Luke and Owen basically make this picture.  Ben Stiller, in my mind, was the least effective member of the cast.
It has been said that many movies are about dysfunctional families, but the Royal Tenenbaums is about a dysfunctional family with every family member dysfunctional.  That's a good summation.
The movie is generally good-hearted, and genuinely funny.  The acting is solid, the cinematography is excellent, and the art direction is very good.
Overall, I gave this four stars based upon the acting, but ultimately, what is the point of this film???",1008633600,5,730,5.267241379310345
1698039,5,B0000640VJ,"After much anticipation, I have to say that this film is not at all a let down. It is easily my favorite film this year. It is quite funny and often quite affecting. Many more excellent examples of Wes Anderson's keen eye, wonderful attention to detail and stunning use of music(another great score By mark Mothersbaugh also!). I've seen it twice and am still dying to see it again!",1008633600,7,382,4.550724637681159
1698040,5,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson's follow up to his cult classic ""Rushmore"" (a sort of 90s equivalent to ""Heathers"" in terms of its intelligent and brutally hilarious examination of young people) cements a filmmaking style that can now rightly be coined ""Andersonian."" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" once again displays Anderson's remarkable ability to create completely self-enclosed, whimsical, fairy-tale environments and then populate them with extraordinary, but always real, characters who must overcome real human dilemmas. In this case, the central dilemma is whether or not three precocious, brilliant children (similar to J.D. Salinger's Glass family) who grew up to become troubled, lonely adults can find it within themselves to forgive their selfish, but genuinely regretful father, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) -- the rejected patriarch of the Tenenbaum family.
Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have lovingly drawn the characters of Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Richie (Luke Wilson) and have infused each of them with a poignancy that stays with you long after you leave the theater. You get a strong sense that inside each of their cold, brittle hearts is a tenderness that longs for the love and acceptance of their father, to whom they feel they were never quite good enough.
In one particularly revealing scene, Royal confronts the older Margot (played beautifully by Paltrow in a role that harkens back to her small, dark, but always unforgettable early performances in films like ""Hard 8"" and ""Se7en"") on a staircase. He says to her, ""You were a genius once,"" to which she replies glumly, ""No, I wasn't."" He says, ""Well, that's what people said, anyway,"" as if he had needed confirmation from others as to the brilliance of his own children. This is a small example of the type of honesty that Anderson and Wilson bring to their treatment of each of their characters. There are simply no easy solutions to the problems that the central characters in this film deal with, and Anderson and Wilson do them (and us) the justice of allowing them to grow only as quickly as each of them are able. Even something as simple as Margot attempting, but failing, to quit smoking in the film exemplifies this treatment.
Some reviewers have criticized Anderson by saying that he spent more time fabricating his unique, filmic world than in developing his characters. While it is true that ""Rushmore"" presented us with a much more fully realized character (Max Fischer), it is unfair to compare that film to ""Tenenbaums,"" since the latter is clearly meant to be an exploration of an entire family (thus the tagline, ""Family isn't a word, it's a sentence""), and ensemble pieces are rarely, if ever, as tight as singe-character pieces. No, the gift that ""Tenenbaums"" presents us with is, by the end, making us want to be a part of this grand family, as troubled and unpredictable and loopy though it may be. Not only this, but the film made me want to get on better terms with my own family, and for that, I feel like I owe a debt of thanks to Mr. Anderson and Mr. Wilson.",1008547200,13,3071,4.953488372093023
1698041,5,B0000640VJ,"What more can be said?  Wes Anderson has an incredible way of taking characters and creating characatures.  His direction, cinematography, and soundtrack may owe much to ""The Graduate"", but it is appropriate and done with care.  Gene Hackman deserves an Award for his role as Royal the curmudgeon.  I also found it appropriate that Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilsons roles were toned down to balance with all the other eccentric players.  And it is always fun to find the old standbys who have been in all his past movies!  Best Play Ever Man!",1008460800,9,551,4.747368421052632
1698042,5,B0000640VJ,"I was dying to see this since I first heard about it because I loved ""Rushmore"" so much. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is - amazingly - far better and more mature and even funnier than ""Rushmore"". I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. Comic, dramatic, sweet, sad, poignant, deeply felt. Truly great, inspirational and inspired filmmaking. A must see.",1008028800,6,357,4.774193548387097
1698043,4,B0000640VJ,"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this film, and I was ecstatic when I found out the film society at my school was holding an advanced screening.  I just got back from that screening, and I'd say this is by far the most mature of the Anderson/Wilson screenplays, however not quite as good as that of Rushmore.  The direction, though, was superior.

Anderson builds on the offbeat shots and cinematography that characterized Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, resulting in unquestionably one of the most visually interesting films I've ever seen.  It seems like Hollywood exposure and big budgets ruins the craft of a lot of directors, but it has only made Anderson better.  It is obvious he was able to give others some of the tasks he worried about for his previous two films and thus pour more of his energy into the direction.

On top of all this, his cast was, as always, top rate.  I never used to respect Bill Murray, but after his performances in the two most recent Anderson flicks I love the guy.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers that this is a brilliant dramedy...I personally preferred the more subtle Rushmore, but that is just personal preference.  The film deals with the subject of family both humorously and seriously, often at the same time.",1007942400,4,1274,4.702702702702703
1698064,5,B0000640VJ,"This movie here is a finely  narrated gem of a flick that takes a long hard look at the fictional Tenebaum family and their lovers. Oh so funny at times but best not blink for your sure to miss something, in plain English watch 2 or more times and find out what I did, the second viewing is as good if not better than the first! I owned a copy and have purchased it again because I love to show it to others as well. An easy 10 on a scale of 1 through 9.

1698068,5,B0000640VJ,"I first saw Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums about 6 or 7 years after it came out (I'm often a latecomer to these sort of films). But one thing I noticed when I saw it was that it made a great, profound and perfect connection with me which I found incredible. It wasn't because I could relate to the story (not coming from a large, artistic dysfunctional family). And not because of having an adopted sibling, or any of the many ""entangling"" aspects of the plot. No, it was all about style. I had been waiting forever for a motion picture that looked and felt like this to come along, in an age when everything was about stuff blowing up, generic chick flicks, and those Merchant-Ivory costume dramas. This film was smartly written, acted superbly, full of a dry wit, bursting at the seams with a truly unique cinematic visual style, and in a word REFRESHING. At last that film had come along! And now about 16 or so years since TRT was released, and about a decade or so after I first got to it, I can say truthfully say this is one of my all time favorite movies, and one I'll never grow tired of.
  The plot is way too complicated to speak of here, but the idea is that of a dysfunctional family called the Tenenbaums, led by their deadbeat patriarch Royal. The 2 sons, Chas and Richie, along with adopted daughter Margot, hold some level of resentment towards him, as does his ex-wife Etheline. Royal's attempts to repair any breaches he made in the past result in moments that are funny, painful, touching and moving. Other characters of various eccentric kinds come and go throughout the film, adding to the tapestry that is TRT. It's the kind of film I'm sure Robert Altman must have envied, with it's magnificent ensemble cast. Gene Hackman gives one of his best performances as Royal, and is the heart of this movie. Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson are great as polar opposites of brothers. Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous, with her racoon eyeshade, fur coat and Jerry Garcia-esque wooden finger. It's my favorite performance from her. Owen Wilson (who also co-wrote the film) gives a typical stoner-like performance as the out-there novelist Eli Cash. Angelica Huston and Danny Glover also stand out in the cast quite well. And Bill Murray (who of course is always our reason to get up every morning and trudge on with this thing called life) gives a deadpan performance that ranks as one of his best. And Wes Anderson regulars Seymour Cassell and Kumar Pallana are always good to see. All in all one of the best cast films ever.
  This version, from the vaunted Criterion Collection, is the one to get for this film. The first disc has the movie, with several features, one of which is the Wes Anderson director commentary. He is one of the best right now at doing the commentary on his own films, and this one is very entertaining and illuminating. The actual film looks splendid in this transfer (and now makes me think this is one of the great New York films ever, having been made right before 9/11). The 2nd disc has tons more features, including interviews with the cast and director, as well as a great documentary on WA and his art. Plus lots of illustrations that you see throughout the film (another memorable part). How can you beat that?
  It would have been great if the CC could have included the soundtrack to the film with the DVDs as a bonus, but I guess they are not entitled to do that. It's a shame, because the soundtrack is one of the great movie soundtracks ever. Filed with great music from Nico, Van Morrison, Nick Drake, Paul Simon, The Rolling Stones, The Clash, The Ramones, John Lennon and more, it's a set of tunes that perfectly compliment the emotions and action on the screen. Rarely has popular song and cinematic image been matched so well. Just as a bonus review, I give that CD a full 5 stars. Grab that one too while you're at it.
  So if you're in the mood for a quirky, odd but great movie, a film that namechecks other films such as Witness, The French Connection, and Taxi Driver without going all Tarentino on us, and a film that does stand the test of time, then this is it. The Royal Tenenbaums is a film that, if given time and not picked up in the middle, will be so enriching to your cinematic lives. Who needs stuff blowing up anyway?------------PEACE

And if your own family life was blessed and cursed by the kinds of relationships among parents and adult children that make up the Tenenbaums, it comes as a relief to know that someone was able to imagine and then create something that looks much like your own dysfunctional family.",1469664000,,527,4.387755102040816

My problem with this film, as well as Anderson's other work, is that the situations are so absurd and improbable that I have trouble connecting with it on an emotional level, even though the acting is very convincing.

Many people seem to disagree with this sentiment, but if you allow the style to grow on you, rather than obstinately reject it because it's something entirely different feeling than the standard films these people usually watch, you will find a layered and unique experience.

The Criterion Collection Blu Ray is more than worth the price. Wes Anderson's colors and detailed sets all shine unlike any film I've seen on Blu Ray. The audio is great, and the amazing soundtrack is absolutely done justice.

I cannot recommend this brilliant film or this beautiful version of the film enough. I suggest watching the film for yourself to see if you like it because Anderson's work is very divisive, but if it sticks for you like it did for me and so many others, I guarantee you won't be disappointed with this Blu Ray.

1698365,3,B0000640VJ,"Call me a late bloomer, but my first introduction to Wes Anderson was with The Grand Budapest Hotel, which took a moment to warm up to. But it's fast paced fantasy via flip flopping through history and it's cast of characters won me over quickly. So then why so many copies of The Royal Tenenbaums going cheaply everywhere? Because it's truly a 'majestic mess' in a good and bad way. Like The Hotel New Hampshire, it's a strange movie that I wasn't really sure I had witnessed properly when I saw it. A family and adventures akin to a 23 car pile up in Des Moines right after Valentines day. Bodies, blood, and heart shaped boxes dribbling out chocolates amid the carnage. Justice to some, tragedy to others, And in a short time it will all be swept away so that traffic can resume normally and safely. Is it worth investigating? Was there a culprit or any real motive behind it? Any heroes who were sadly cut short in their valor? Or just cosmic irony and probability at it's peak colliding in the middle of nowhere? Fascinating, sad, unbelievable, and spiritually confusing. And to add insult to injury (pardon the pun....); is there any entertainment value in any of it? That's what The Royal Tenenbaums seems to set out to find in a jam packed jalopy of a great cast and an uneven road lined with lamentations. To some maybe a feast for the imagination and emotions. But to me, it serves as a primer to how Wes learned to tighten things up for The Grand Budapest Hotel. And some may argue that movie is TOO fast. But I'd still have to say for Wes, his talent and niche mantra should be 'speed is the key'. You may wish to adopt or not The Royal Tenenbaums. But shall always be a friend of the family to your Criterion collection.",1451952000,,1733,4.435736677115988

Its photography is done with care and the shots are beautiful; however, to the viewers of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, the style can seem derivative (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children, Amelie etc.).

Now, the plot... There is a decent storyline here: foundation, obstacles, resolutions, blah blah... The main problem is: the script oozes the desire to be philosophical and smart. Intelligent. Original. It strives for all that. But it's ultimately devoid of any deeper meaning. I will remember it for its imagery, but everything else is very forgettable.",1448064000,,664,5.027272727272727

1698457,5,B0000640VJ,"For my money, Wes Anderson just doesn't get any better than this. The Royal Tenenbaums is where he strikes that perfect blend of heartstring and humor, spontaneous weirdness and obsessive attention to detail. The family itself has enough history to carry an entire franchise, but the film doesn't bother to wallow in it for long; there's just too much going on in the foreground to spend more than a few savory moments on back story. Loaded with talent, it pulls everything from its cast. Whether it's Gene Hackman as the conniving, two-faced patriarch with a sudden need for intimacy, Anjelica Huston as his long-sacrificing ex-wife, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow as their never-had-a-childhood offspring, or the vast array of eccentric, colorful supporting characters, it's tough not to appreciate each as a leading-caliber performance. The Royals' tale is vivid and real, emotive and wounded but also spirited and playful. It resonates in a modern setting, especially, when so many of our friends' and family members' tightest circles are similarly dysfunctional. Layered and complex without feeling superficial or overstretched, it's a whole bundle of emotions, flavors, sights and senses smashed into a single, rich, evergreen portrait. I feel this one in my heart's private pantry and my stomach's deepest pit. Wonderful.",1438300800,,1342,5.3649289099526065

1698530,5,B0000640VJ,"This is one of my all time fav movies. Well written, and superbly acted, stylized without being over the top, The Royal Tenenbaums is a masterpiece of film-making. It is a dense story, complicated, but not overly so. Despite the fact that the cast is huge, the story is so well crafted and superbly acted that the viewer never gets completely lost. For my money, this is Wes Andersons Magnum Opus, which is not to take away from his other works before or since. I recently viewed The Grand Budapest Hotel, and it is definitely on a par with Tenenbaums. I bought this DVD to replace the VHS copy I picked up on the cheap years ago, and I look forward to exploring the extras on the DVD.",1427587200,,685,4.359375

Such a phenomenal cast, and great performances, and interesting visuals, and terrific sets...but a lame, pointless, meandering plot. I had little sympathy for the manipulative protagonist, Royal. I was disappointed by the way the storyline totally dropped the ""child prodigy"" plot line. I was confused by the inexplicable (and perverse) romantic entanglements, which didn't seem to fit the characters.

For what it's worth, I've never liked Ben Stiller's characters, but he's great in this film. And it's nice to see Bill Murray in a smaller role. He adds a lot without chewing the scenery.

I loved the idiosyncrasies in the characters, the almost cartoon-like appearance and personality. All of Anderson's films are shot with this surrealist type feel to it, and I dig it. Also the very dry, dark, and at times absurd sense of humor he uses in it. I watched this with someone else and they didn't care for it much, I can understand why someone wouldn't like Wes Anderson films, but I love them and this ones another gem.",1418601600,,596,4.330357142857143

1698739,1,B0000640VJ,"I actually saw this movie in the theater with my mother, and the theater was full.  We were expecting a comedy as the reviewers had implied.  Instead, we got a slow and boring movie about a group of completely repulsive characters.  Nobody in the theater laughed once.  In fact, the entire audience walked out in dead silence.

The father of the family had abandoned his wife and young children, having lived since then in a posh hotel.  But the money has run out, and the father comes back to his wife and now-adult children.  He wants to reconcile, but for his own purposes.

But as it turns out, every one of the family is just plain weird.  Not one is likable or even two-dimensional.  Nor is the supporting cast any better.  If we hadn't been in the theater, we would have stop watching it much sooner.  We're supposed to laugh at things like incest and dogs being crushed by cars.  Seriously, the movie has forever ruined my enjoyment of the Rolling Stones' ""Ruby Tuesday"" song.

Acting by everyone involved is terrible, there is little real story except for the stories of how the children turned out-and they all turned out to be weird, and not in a good way.  I know people praise this too the skies and say how wonderful and high art it is, but I find that these people say that because they're supposed to say that, not because they genuinely mean it.",1405900800,6,1362,4.479674796747967

1698745,1,B0000640VJ,"Oh, if only we had realized it was a Wes Anderson film before we rented this pretentious, dysfunctional train wreck... We realized it about 5-10mins in and by that point we were too upset we had spent money on it to not watch it. Though to be honest we ended up eventually using it as an excuse to snooze so we might as well have not watched it.

The only thing nice about his movies is this beautiful, antique like, ros coloring he uses and the magnificent use of symmetry in the camera work. Other than that it's complete garbage, where the adults act like misbehaved children and the children act like jaded adults.

Such a letdown, such a disaster. It's not funny, it's not smart, it's just a dysfunctional disappointment... As par usual for the course with him.",1404000000,9,766,4.503597122302159

1698758,5,B0000640VJ,"I can't be friends with someone who doesn't like this movie.  Someone who doesn't appreciate subtle comedy, tone, cinematography, quirkiness, camera-play, sharp dialogue, the sound of Alec Baldwin's voice, TRT's soundtrack, and Wes Anderson's unique style.

If you go into this movie expecting a comedy, you may be disappointed.  It doesn't inform you that it's being funny, or when it's time to laugh, like so much television and films do.  TRT's comedy lies within it's tone.

It's thrilling for me when all of the characters on the screen are being completely serious and dramatic, yet the scene is funny.  This kind of magical writing / acting / directing really blows me away.

One of my favorite movies ever.  Thank-you Wes Anderson.",1401667200,2,739,5.049586776859504

I've seen it many times and, on the sad day I realized I DIDN'T have it in my personal collection I immediately ordered it to round out the Wes Anderson offerings. I particularly like this movie because it revolves around a whole family with little interaction from outsiders. The quirks and trials that plague most families are depicted, in typical Wes Anderson fashion, as charming where they might otherwise be considered depressing.

The DVD set I purchased was a two-disc set with some features on the second disc including commentaries, behind the scenes, out takes, and some featurettes.",1399766400,,619,5.068627450980392

1698793,5,B0000640VJ,"This film, like all of W. Anderson's works, has an artifice that lead some to deem it as an exercise of style over substance. The characters also are often aloof and don't connect with human emotion in a genuine way. Yet when you dig past the surface you find a subtly brilliant, beautiful film with very poignant themes. There are subtle moments that just make me choke and misty eyed when I watch them (When Ben Stiller's character loses his dog and Royal adopts a firefighter's dalmation for him, and of course the ""Needle in the Hay"" scene). I could go on about this film. It's just really special to my heart.
But anyways, technically speaking, the transfer is brilliant, being a Criterion edition, and really compliments the popping colors that this film boasts. The features give you a very interesting look at the making of the movie, and the artwork is a great treat. I highly recommend this if you need an introduction to Anderson's World.",1396224000,,949,4.688622754491018

1698800,5,B0000640VJ,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Maybe a strange choice considering all the classics out there, yet Mr. Anderson has a way of creating movies that can touch the heart of all those who see it. A perfect cast including Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, Danny Glover, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, and Owen and Luke Wilson. The story of a family of geniuses abandoned by their father, the brilliant children grow up to become damaged caricatures of their former selves. A hauntingly beautiful story complemented with a soundtrack by Mark  Mark Mothersbaugh as well as various artists, this movie is a must for any fans of Wes Anderson (Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, Moonrise Kingdom, etc.). Definitely 5 stars.

I think this and Rushmore are Anderson's two greatest movies (I kind of vacillate between which I prefer.)  I think Bottle Rocket was still him learning how to make a movie, and after Royal Tenenbaums he kind of got full of himself, but this one was right there in the sweet spot.

1698872,4,B0000640VJ,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family, which is brought together from the four corners of the Earth when the patriarch announces he's about to die from cancer. Gene Hackman gives a subtle performance as Royal, while Anjelica Huston plays his wife.

Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray play supporting roles. While I must say the casting is spectacular, unfortunately Bill Murray isn't given much to do.

Wes Anderson is well-known for this film, and rightfully so. It's an interesting look at what binds family together, with some truly hilarious moments.",1378425600,,637,5.297029702970297

1698879,5,B0000640VJ,"Gene Hackman must have had a field day playing Royal Tenenbaum, the estranged patriarch of the dysfunctional Tenenbaum family.  A particularly funny series of scenes are those where Hackman's character goes about entertaining his two young grandsons (ages 6-8, maybe) by involving them in a series of shenanigans that take them far outside the sheltered world set up by their father (and Royal's son) played by Ben Stiller.  Royal plays lookout as he encourages the boys to steal treats from a convenience store, leads them in throwing water balloons at passing cars, and shows them how to hop a ride on a garbage truck!

My favorite character in this movie is the sharp-tongued adopted daughter played by Gweneth Paltrow.  Paltrow plays a laconic and downbeat young woman who wears dark eye makeup, constantly smokes, and almost never smiles.  She also has a history of stringing along a series of lovers.  Bill Murray plays her glum and cuckolded older husband, an eccentric neurologist who is usually accompanied by his teenage patient.",1374883200,,1039,5.08235294117647

1698935,5,B0000640VJ,"This movie is objectively good. Although it receives a lot of criticism for being boring or having failed to utilize that amazing cast it brought together such reviews are just plain wrong. If you go into this movie expecting Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson to be themselves you will be disappointed. If you assume that any of these people will be playing to their past comedic rolls you will be disappointed.  If you think Wes Anderson should be like Rushmore, well once again, you will be disappointed. Mr. Anderson is an artist, and like most artist he grows and changes (that doesn't mean this isn't a tour de force. It is.)

If you expect this movie to be a comedy or drama well it is, but it would be better labeled as a movie about life. Is life dramatic? Yes. Is life funny? Yes. Is life tragic? Yes. Does Royal Tenebaums have all of these things? Yes.  None the less, it is exceptionally well done. Every actor gives an excellent performance. The writing is every one of the aforementioned types, and the sound track is really great.  The pacing is something you have to get used to but once you are it is really wonderful. If you like Arrested Development, you should probably like this because all the notes that Arrested Development hits are clanged twice as hard by this great movie.

Critical Advice: Don't go into it with expectations, just watch and think about what the movie is trying to communicate. If you do this then you will love the movie.",1367712000,,1458,4.549618320610687

1698938,5,B0000640VJ,"That THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a great movie is unquestioned by those who love it.  That there are many who do not ""get"" it only adds to that appeal.  I have friends who are intelligent and love movies and have great senses of humor, yet they have watched this movie and upon returning it have told me they just didn't enjoy it. That happens with this movie.

Yet I still think this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  And yes: the fact that it appeals only to certain of us makes it even more endearing.

Mind you, these are not absolute, but if you enjoy absurdist family humor that is fairly ""dry,"" then TRT might just be for you.

The movie is directed by Wes Anderson, who co-wrote the movie with Owen Wilson. Anderson has a history of quirky movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-Aquatic-with-Steve-Zissou/dp/B003QSGF0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>) in which he seems to revel in letting his actors expand within their characterizations and take over the movie.  He also has an expert touch with cinematography; his sets are intimate and charming, creating a homey quality that comes next to claustrophobic, reveling in an expert sense of capturing the moments of character discovery that so often happen within his movies.

Here it is no different, as plot is almost secondary to characterization.  It is our coming to terms with these wealthy, privileged but ultimately lost human beings that drives our appreciation of the movie.  In short, if you don't like the characters here, you won't like this movie.  As such, I think discussion of the characters is more important than any real plot summary ...

Royal Tenenbaum, played by everyman actor Gene Hackman, is the head of a severely crippled family that is more or less stumbling on forward with life.  Perhaps the truest synopsis of this family's problems is that they achieved success too early and are wading aimlessly now in the tide pool of that success, trying to find their way ahead.  Though the movie begins with the estranged Royal explaining his upcoming divorce to his three grown children, it is only in the broadest sense that it could be said the movie is told from his perspective, in that we observe this mess of a family from the outside looking in.

His wife is Etheline, played by the marvelous Anjelica Huston.  A noted archeologist, that she is attempting to divorce her husband is no surprise, but Henry, her accountant and the man she hopes to someday marry, is played by Danny Glover and he could be no more different than Royal if he tried.  He is careful, tactful, thoughtful...and quite dull.

The children consist of:

Chas, obsessively played by an angry Ben Stiller:  An international finance expert, Chas sued his father when he was in his early teens due to his father's theft of his savings bonds.  Most importantly, however, he is a frenetic father whose inability to deal with his wife's death in a plane crash leads him to cling to his children like a mother hen in a doghouse. He openly hates his father, who shot him in the back with a BB gun when he was young.

Margot, portrayed by a wispy Gwyneth Paltrow.  She is adopted - a fact her father continuously refers to in front of her -- she is a playwright who won a grant when she was a high school freshman, but now spends her days eluding her husband by soaking in a bathtub and secretly smoking.  She has half a finger missing but will not tell her family how it happened.

Richie, ably played by Luke Wilson: A tennis pro who broke down and quit in the midst of a title match at the peak of his career, he is obsessed with adopted sister, and likely quit as a reaction to her marriage.  He spends his time living as a passenger on an ocean liner.

Eli, played by an achingly hopeful yet sad Owen Wilson, is NOT a Tenenbaum, but dearly wishes to be.  He is a young author of Western novels who now spends his days addled on drugs.  He has been having an affair with Margot, and his drug habit will have some effect upon the family as the movie progresses.

And finally, Raleigh St. Clair is played by the droll Bill Murray, a neurologist who excels in studies of the brain and yet has no idea as to what makes people tick.  He spends the movie in an almost disturbing fascination with a young prodigy named Dudley, taking him everywhere so that he can constantly study him while completely ignoring his duties as a husband to Margot.

It's a quaint, neurotic and hilarious movie that is terrifically cast and layered in character...your tenth viewing of it will reveal things to you that you missed in your first nine viewings.  If you ""get"" this movie, it will stay with you forever...it's that good.",1367280000,2,5497,5.272101033295063
1698939,5,B0000640VJ,I absolutely love this movie - Wes Anderson beautifully demonstrates the impact we have in each other's lives - particularly our children's lives - and the devastation that can follow when we fail to take that into consideration.

I just recently became a Wes Anderson fan after I saw Moonrise Kingdom.

There are thousands of movies that may be condemned for their nihilism, violence, sexual sadism, sexism, racism, homophobia, hatred of the poor and celebration of the rich, ahistoricism, and/or for their deliberate propaganda, and one might say that this film isn't in any of those categories, except nihilism with a  dolap of sexism thrown in.  The film doesn't even deserve one star, but there is no negative star rating.  If Amazon had one, it would deserve five negative stars.  It's imbecilic, narcissistic, childish, boring.  The characters are one dimensional.  No motives or nuances are shown or implied, except insofar as they fall into the above categories..  Even the clothing and sets are offensive:  The colors are jarring and annoying; the sets are weird, ugly to no purpose other than idiosyncrasy.  The dialog offers nothing,  The facial expressions are zombie like.  There is likewise no real humor in the script or characters.  There is no social context for the characters. Don't buy this movie. It is a downer,  It makes one mad that money and effort goes into such idiocies and that we are expected to like it, even love it, and praise it as art, and that people actually praise it on Amazon and thus get people to purchase it.

I laughed out loud, once, but failed to connect with a single character, though I tried to root for them all. My guess is that its flaw was its overuse of quirkiness as a substitute for characterization.

On the upshot, its seeming unwieldiness was well-controlled and even playful in parts as it purposely and enjoyably grinds cliche into grist to keep the camera rolling.

But for all its movement, you see the results, rarely the cause. I think the work was ambitious, as it delivered what is essentially a postmodern novel in a flashpan (even intriguing) rhythm that few modern authors can produce with the written word alone.

If Anderson doesn't let bitterness get the best of him as he ages, and learns to connect his moving pictures with the seated people watching his clever lights flicker, he will be great.",1356739200,3,873,4.878378378378378

The first time I watched this movie I felt the way many of the other reviewers felt. Too dry. Boring. waste of time. where is the funny?!?!?

However, after I watched it again(...and again... ...and again...etc.) this movie is amazing!!!  The humor is just so subtle, the situations are just so out there, and everything feels so sarcastically serious.  It's great! The movie is a crazy, dark, and hilarious journey of one jerk of a father trying to reconcile with his estranged family.  The cast is outstanding and everyone of them hits their mark; although, I wish the great Bill Murray had a more significant role.  I guess Anderson was going for that slightly ironic role and Murray would have stolen the show if he had it.

Of course, the humor is not for everyone.  Depending on your taste, the random events and dialogue that occur can easily come off as boring or stupid.  Not for me though.  The zany, eccentric characters get me laughing every time!",1352419200,,979,4.705882352941177

1699076,4,B0000640VJ,"The Tenenbaums are a family of individuals who create a family. They are separate but trying to come together.

Royal Tenebaums played by Gene hackman, left the family many years ago for reasons unknown, even to him. His wife, Etheline, played superbly by Anjelica Houston, is the thread that keeps the family together. Sons, Chas played by Ben Stiller, Richie, played by Luke Wilson, and adopted daughter, Margot, played by Gwenyth Paltrwow, are a mixed lot. All appear to be depressed, and they all move home again. The house is large, descripit but large. Chas brings his two sons, all grieving the loss of their mother. Margot leaves her husband, psychologist, Raleigh, played by Bill Murray. Their next door neighbor, Eli, played by Owen Wilson, is a successful author of westerns, which garner terrible reviews. Royal comes home, saying he is dying of cancer. No one seems to care much, but he is trying to mend fences. This is at once a comedy and a dramedy. Laugh out loud and then morose. All are seeking attention, and the ploys that are used are astounding.

We can all find a bit of us in these characters and how they react. Every family is like this in many ways. Now, we see it upfront and personal on the big screen.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-28-12

1699077,1,B0000640VJ,One of the most disappointing films I've seen. I kept watching for some humor and it never developed. A waste of precious time.,1344988800,5,127,4.565217391304348
1699078,4,B0000640VJ,"A fair number of individuals are still gushing over ""Moonrise Kingdom."" It's bound to make several best of lists by the end of the year even though it seems like we still have so much left to see with unlimited potential. Wes Anderson has always impressed as far as his filmmaking goes. While you wait for ""Moonrise Kingdom"" to come to Blu-ray, Criterion Collection is getting ready to release ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" on Blu-ray. Speaking as someone who hadn't seen ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" previously, it seemed like the perfect chance to finally get around to doing so.

""The Royal Tenenbaums"" looks amazing on Blu-ray. Colors flourish and Anderson's visual style only seems to benefit from high definition. That 70s sense of style also seems to jump out quite a bit, but maybe it already did before the jump to Blu-ray. Anderson gives intricate attention to detail like the wallpaper in the hotel or the paintings in Eli's house and it is just exquisite. All of Anderson's films up until ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" were rated R, but ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" seems to have a darker tone in comparison to all of Anderson's other work. The humor is darker and there's such an emphasis on suicide in the middle of the film. In fact, the exchange of dialogue between Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson) is some of the most humorous material in the entire film.

There's always an easy connection or automatic sense of relatability whenever a film revolves around a family suffering from a father who just doesn't care. When you go through something similar, it just speaks to you more than the average person. The way Royal (Gene Hackman) is so manipulative and a pathological liar along with the way he still feels like his family owed him what he thought he deserved felt very familiar. Royal tries to make up for lost time though and even seems to be doing so by the end of the film. It's always rewarding when a film can end the way you wish your life could.

With all of Anderson's trademarks and personal connections aside, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is good but not nearly as great as some of Anderson's other work. Most of the characters felt very similar, which was probably done on purpose since most of them were from the same family and they were all tainted by Royal just not giving a damn about anyone but himself. But none of the performances really pull you in. The quirkiness was there as was Anderson's dry humor; you can't have a Wes Anderson film without either of those. The humor felt somewhat filtered though and wasn't nearly as excessive or as commonly used as much as Anderson is known for. Everyone felt so emotionally withdrawn. It was like something was missing the entire time and once that something was finally on the cusp of being regained the film ended.

""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a must for any Wes Anderson fan and should be an instant buy on Blu-ray for Criterion's reputation alone. Despite an incredible cast, a darker tone, and every great attribute Anderson is known for (cinematography, music, writing, etc), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is an exceptional drama but its comedy just doesn't compare to the likes of ""Rushmore"" or even ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.""

1699080,5,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson is the crown prince of quirky (King would have to be David Lynch). When I listened to the director's commentary for this movie, it ended up being Anderson talking in ridiculous levels of detail about the vintage sneakers some extra was wearing in the background, or the wallpaper he got for the hallway which we see for about four minutes. It's absolutely nutty. And yet, that's what you're buying.

The cast is brilliant. Everyone performs fairly far out of their typical character set. Gwynneth Paltrow does a swell job, even, and I'm not often that nice to the young miss. Bill Murray is his always-solid self. Gene Hackman deserves an Oscar for this performance, but we know how that goes.

So often, I think Hollywood banks on names rather on, you know, the finished product, and they try to make this sort of SUPER MOVIE that will appeal to everyone.  Such was probably the case with the casting and writing of TRT.  This was definitely a case of the cast being assembled before the first word hit the page.

Okay, but Gene and Angelica scew a little old...I'll put them in, but I need someone young..edgy, fresh.  That Paltrow chick is good.

Oh, there should be some kind of friction with the parents...divorce?  Sure.  Divorce is hilarious.  Note to self:  Tell Wilson to make the parents divorced.  Oh, does that count as a writing credit for me?  Whoo hoo!  But what else?  I mean, divorce by itself it not rip snorting enough.  WAIT!  I know, the other can be married to another man....wait...a black guy!  Yes!  That's hilarious and controversial!  I am rockin' the edge of sanity with this movie!  I am out there!  I am so very, very cool!

Oh there's the phone...hello?  Ben Stiller?  Do I have anything for you?  Well let me think?  Hey, I'm doing a picture right now...sure there's room for you.  You want to be pictured a little more mature?  How about...how about if I make you a father?  Of boys?  You like that?  Great!

Geez, that Stiller guy...always in my face.  Well, I'll just make sure he looks ridiculous in this movie...bad hair and bad wardrobe for him.  Why?  Because I am the director...and the writer!  I am Hollywood gold!""

Having viewed this movie many times before, I purchased the Criterion Collection to hear the commentary by Wes Anderson with hope to discover new findings by the creator.

Wes Anderson films are all about hanging out with eccentric characters in their cartoon worlds for a couple of hours. There is story but it comes in its own original way which has always been the attraction for me (see also RUSHMORE and THE LIFE AQUATIC). In Royal Tenebaums there are so many central characters, interesting and comical, that you get this great opportunity to hang out with this privileged, dysfunctional family and their associates in their Manhattan homes and surrounding streets. With so much meticulous detail and vivid colour you will be left wishing to visit the surreal New York before you. Filled with dead pan comedy, the film is very funny while sharing some sad moments. It requires repeat viewing to truly enjoy all the jokes, many of them visual. The entire cast give excellent performances, especially Hackman, Paltrow, and Stiller.

The fact that Wes Anderson movies adhere to no traditional three act story prerequisites, allows all the film's signature storytelling surprises along the way, such as the musical montages and Alec Baldwin narration.

1699160,5,B0000640VJ,"I think I mentioned before that Wes Anderson is a little hit or miss with me.  Sometimes he really nails it (`Fantastic Mr. Fox') and other times his chaotic mixture of comedic absurdity and dramatic tension is a little out of balance and somewhat annoying (`Rushmore').  `The Royal Tenenbaums' was the first film I ever saw by Anderson, and it still remains my favorite.  The film is simply stunning, the perfect balance of drama and humor, with a winning cast who makes the most out of every second they are on screen.

This film sadly comes in second to `Gosford Park' in both ensemble and screenplay for me this year, but it is a VERY close second.

This film tells the story of Royal Tenenbaum, an aging patriarch to a family of geniuses.  Royal is a very hard man to get along with, and his family has grown quite detached from him.  As he approaches the end of his life he becomes aware of his failings as a father and desires to make amends.  As with any relationship, the longer it goes unattended the harder it is to mend.  Despite his efforts, Royal doesn't seem to understand how to fix the mess he created.

But of course, where there is a will there is a way.

The screenplay is honestly a work of genius.  I mean, both this and `Gosford Park' probably constitute two of the best screenplays of the entire decade (both would lose to `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', but that is one of the greatest screenplays ever written in the entire history of cinema).  Anderson and co-writer (and one of the films stars) Owen Wilson really work comedic magic, weaving these absurd yet surprisingly deep and moving characters through a whirlwind of inspiring and original sub-plots that never once become tedious or confusing.  Everything here only serves to deepen our appreciation for the story being told.

And that appreciation is immortalized in the films ensemble.  Like with their screenplays, both this film and `Gosford Park' are two of the best ensembles of the decade (they may actually be the two best).  Every performance here is on point and perfectly compliments the other.  Gene Hackman (one of the best actors to ever walk the earth) is perfection here, cultivating a deadpan comedic delivery that rivals Bill Murray's masterful work in `Lost in Translation'.  Ben Stiller, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow (total highlight), Luke Wilson, (the glorious) Anjelica Huston and the hysterical Kumar Pallana all add to the films comedic core with richly detailed performances.

With scenes that will stay with you long after the film has ended (that car crash scene alone is cinematic perfection), `The Royal Tenenbaums' is, like my title suggests, comedic royalty.

I understand that this film is not for everyone.  Like I personally admitted, Wes Anderson is not a director whose vision is universally understood or even appreciated.  I don't even appreciate all his work, but I admire and respect his dedication to his craft.  At least he has a vision.  He isn't a generic director.  His work speaks loudly as to the man that he is and the visionary he has become.  You know a Wes film when you see it, and that is the mark of a true auteur.  Whether you love him, hate him or are still trying to make up your mind, we all can respect him for what he has achieved.

He has a achieved a lot with this magnificent film!",1271376000,,3365,4.694539249146757

The basic plot is a family of child prodigies gets back together when their patriarch is dying, and all the dysfunction of the family comes out in the wash.

The movie has a first rate cast and some possibilities but it tries to cram much too much into a single movie.  Nothing gets developed, nothing really matters and when one character decides to slit their wrists all you feel is as my wife put it, ""One less boring character to follow.""

It's amazing what you can do if you take an all star cast and shoehorn them into a film that isn't really as good as they are.  Certainly Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston are pretty good and do well with their material but the rest of the first rate cast just seem to drift unable to make lemonade out of the lemon they are given.

Ironically this might have worked as a sitcom or mini series.  This would have given time to allow us to get to know the characters more and develop them.  Of course you couldn't afford this kind of cast but I still think it could would have worked.

1699219,5,B0000640VJ,"Tell me a story...

The Royal Tenenbaums is a film that could have started out as a book, one of
those books, like Harry Potter, that has illustrations so that you can imagine the characters mostly for yourself, with a bit of help from the author.

As the story is not in fact from a book, I am going to say that it is like a snow globe, a tiny universe that makes sense if you press your nose up against the glass and squint.

Without the narrator (Alec Baldwin), you would be completely lost. Some people are completely lost anyway, given the number of factual errors that occur in the reviews printed here.

A brief summary: The story starts with all of the Tenenbaum children, who appear to be in their thirties, moving back to their mother's home, a castle-sized house located somewhere in New York. Explanations are skimpy for this at best. At the same time, across town, their father, estranged from the family for years, needs a free place to stay.

So, for the first time in 18 years, all of the Tenenbaums are together under one roof.

The mood of the film varies like the weather. Sometimes it is beautiful and sunny; sometimes it is grey and snowing.

Flashback to 18 years ago: Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman)  is a successful litigator, his wife, Etheline (Angelica Huston) an anthropologist, the three children are prodigies:
Ritchie  (Luke Wilson), a tennis champion
Chas (Ben Stiller), a wizard at business
Adopted daughter Margot (Gweneth Paltrow), a successful playwright

The marriage breaks up, the children grow up but not well, Etheline dates but does not remarry, in fact, she and Royal are still not divorced.

What little action there is seems to be spurred by Etheline's deciding to get married again (to her accountant, played hesitantly by Danny Glover). Royal's competitive juices, so long dormant, are revived, and he stages a play for Etheline's love and sympathy by pretending to be dying of cancer (despite eating a lot of cheeseburgers).

The deus ex machina, that moves the story along to completion, is provided by a family friend called Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), who is presented as a drug-addicted novelist but who is really addicted to the Tenenbaum family.

In contrast to the narrator, who gives a perfectly flat delivery, the music functions as a barometer of affect for each scene.

1699222,5,B0000640VJ,"True...it is a well known fact that, those who know of Wes Anderson, know that he is an ""either-or"" film maker. Plainly stated, you either love his work, or hate it. It is also known that Mr. Anderson's view of comedy is VERY dry...almost sarcastic and very realistic. (I mean, lets face it, there aren't that many Will Ferrels in everyday life) AND his use of this ""stellar cast"" in the film is almost a satire. He has the chance to use each talented member of the cast to the fullest, but chooses not to...almost to see how ""realistic"" each person can be...and how convincing each is to there own characters role...

So, all of the above in consideration...(and strictly in my opinion) I believe this is one of the single most entertaining films I have ever seen. Further more...I will even go as far as to say it is one of the BEST American films ever created. If people don't watch this movie for any other reason, it should be watched for Luke Wilson's performance. The ""bathroom scene"" is one of my favorite scenes in cinema, and possibly Luke at his finest.

The Wilson Brothers really had me since Bottle Rocket, but Luke stole the show in this...

Great movie with a lot to it, and a great plot that plays out in almost a fairytale way. Very creative and open-minded...
and beautifully shot.

I give it 10 stars!!!

1699223,1,B0000640VJ,"I get it. It's trying to be a deadpan, quirky movie about a dysfunctional family. It just isn't NEARLY as good as the pretentious people out there would have you believe. Arrested Development does the same thing but with WAY more interesting characters and humour that never misses the mark.",1219968000,10,291,4.84
1699224,5,B0000640VJ,"I think that Wes Anderson has done a wonderful job directing this film. Initially upon the first viewing I wasn't a hundred percent in love with the movie, however this is the type of film that should be viewed more than once. Every time you watch it you learn something or catch some joke that you didn't notice before. This film does not use the typically blatant humor instead it is rye and witty in a sort of dark way. I think the manner in which the story is narrated and delivered is great not to mention the characters as well. This movie rejects the nuclear family and actually shows a family so dysfunctional that they are almost normal because they are so different just like any other family. I would also recommend the Darjeeling Limited and the Life Aquatic less so which are both also directed by Wes Anderson.",1219795200,,824,4.5
1699225,3,B0000640VJ,"After gaining attention with his quirky early films BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE, writer and director Wes Anderson was able to bring together a wide Hollywood cast for his ambitious 2001 effort THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS. As the movie opens, we are shown the rise of the three children of the Tannebaum family, prodigies who excel in business, sports and literature respectively. The upbringing of these little geniuses is left to their mother Etheline (Angelica Huston) after their father Royal (Gene Hackman) leaves the family. We flashforward to the present day, where the family has fallen from glory. Chas Tennenbaum (Ben Stiller) is too crushed by the death of his wife to focus on business, Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) hasn't written a play in years and sulks most of the day in the bathtub, and Richie (Luke Wilson) retired from tennis after mysteriously blowing his last game. It is at this time that their father returns, and the reconciliation between the family members is the story of the film.

Wes Anderson retains his quirky sense of humour here. Though ostensibly set in the present day, the lives of the characters occasionally seem bound in traditions of a century ago, as when Royal has an Indian servant, and one of Etheline's suitors is a polar explorer, and this gives a certain charm to the picture. Another amusing Anderson touch is the sheer detail of the sets, with background items like newspaper clippings, portraits and bookshelf contents providing a feeling that these characters are fully formed and have a past. That immense detail in the design, too much for the eye to fully take in at once, gives THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS considerable rewatch value.

Supporting roles are quite memorable. Bill Murray, who plays Margot's husband, was to go on to play this type of jaded, unhappy middle-aged man in several films until it just stopped being fun anymore, but this early go at it is quite entertaining (and watch him quietly explode into barely-contained rage at one point in the film). Owen Wilson's character Eli Cash is hilarious, an author of Western novels who gets so caught up in the mythology of the Old West that he starts taking mescaline and descends into drug addiction. In some respects, Cash is somewhat similar to Wilson's character Hansel in ZOOLANDER of the same year.

In his next couple of films, Anderson would continue with many of the same themes and aesthetic found here, which was disappointing and felt like he was only repeating a formula to diminishing results. However, this first film in that vein remains impressive years after its release.",1217116800,4,2588,4.95852534562212

With the Tenenbaums, I absolutely loved every second of the film from the first time I saw it in the theater in 2001.  Gene Hackman is perfectly cast as Royal with his sometimes careless comments to his children during flashbacks, but his funny little sayings, ""You're true blue Ethel,"" makes him almost hard to hate.  Ben Stiller (Chas) is perfect as his crazy perfectionist character. There are too many story lines to explain and too many side stories, but over all, it's amazing, funny, and not boring at all.

It's not that his films are so out of touch with humanity that it's difficult for people to get. But it infact hits the heart of it so well, and Wes knows how to capture a moment in a way that's so different, but unstoppably honest, that it just comes down to the fact that it is not for everyone. Every element is so methodical, from the story itself, to the way it's shot, and the music giving a beautiful backdrop, that when one of his movies ends it leaves you wanting more. It leaves you wanting to continue to follow the characters lives and know more about what happens to them. And can I say, he sure knows how to pick a cast of actors that deliver ever single time. I hope you enjoy the film as much as me, and if not, that's o.k., just pass it on to someone else.",1205366400,3,872,4.105263157894737

We follow Royal Tenenbaum )Gene Hackman), a family patriarch through his attempted reconciliation with his family.  It includes Anjelica Houston as his estranged wife Etheline, Ben Stiller, Gwenyth Paltrow and Luke Wilson as his chlidren Chaz, Margo, and Richie, respectively.  The rest of the cast is good as well, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, and Owen Wilson.

This movie will turn a few off, but I thoroughly enjoyed its quirkiness and attitude.

The two disc Criterion set includes a commentary from Wes Anderson, outtakes (deleted scenes actually), a number of featurettes, and stills of Richie's artwork (Wes's brother's drawings).

1699263,2,B0000640VJ,"Packed with some solid stars (both comedic and straight-laced), 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a delightful and much slanted look at the coessential dysfunctional family that could be from Anywhere, USA. Well, actually it could be from anywhere in the galaxy as you may not come across a more strange slew of characters in one place anywhere on God's green earth. For openers, Gene Hackman plays a hysterical deadbeat dad who had been alienated by the rest of his bizarre family for ignorance to them and vulgarity to others which can include even us the audience. Yet at the same time the viewer will be sympathetic to him and his mischievous routine and rebellious nature given his sly warmheartedness and charm. The trio of the children's life stories (wild and wholly tales portrayed in retrospect and real-time by Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow & Luke Wilson) surround this rude and complex father shortcomings in spectacular fashion while combative yet dignified mom played by Angelica Houston is a steady presence amongst the chaos. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray round out the supporting cast for this fun-filled comedy.

In a way this is the story of the Royal Tenenbaums presided over, not by the eponymous and deliciously amoral patriarch, played superbly by Gene Hackman, following his banishment from the family seat, but by the equally splendid Angelica Huston in the person of Etheline Tenebaum. The pair are the parents of three precocious children who all reach adulthood having left behind the triumphs of their adolescence and are suffering from, in their different ways, the fall-out that early success that is not repeated in adulthood sometimes brings. It's quirky, touching and wonderfully played by a brilliant ensemble cast and once again we are reminded of the genius that Hackman brings to all of his roles: surely only Nicholson can match him in this respect?",1188604800,,873,5.069444444444445

The emotional pack is just slightly missing the fuse at times but other than that, think of this movie as the story of dysfunctional family through the eyes of a director that likes silly people. Yes, it's a quirky looking world the Tenenbaums inhabit and dress for, so if you don't tolerate a director who revels in some visual horseplay here and there, don't watch it! I love it personally, Anderson can play up a satirical look at people while making it all his own vision.

As for the plot, Royal is the patriarch of the family who was exiled long ago for his constant affairs. Gene Hackman plays him as still the same jovial, wild-hearted swindler who realizes when his wife is going to get remarried that he's angry about it. He tries to recapture her interest and tries to make amends with all his children while he's at it. So the movie is essentially a swim through a family's closet of skeletons, arrested angers and hurts, yet the redeeming part is Royal is at least working to try and get everyone a family again, despite his still shallow morals. If there's anything that's a let down about this hilarious trip through the ghosts of a family's past... it's that Bill Murray got a bit part and has no good lines, and other than that there's a love interest subplot that was sort of bittersweet.",1185926400,,1381,4.546184738955823

With fantastic work by the entire cast, this film succeeds in becoming a smart, witty and deep comedy that far surpasses what passes today as a good laugh.

Gene Hackman does a brilliant job as Royal, prick-father to three genius yet dysfunctional children who decides he wants to make peace with his family and become the father he never was.  His children are splendidly played by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Stiller plays Chas, the athletic financier who buries himself in work to avoid confronting the death of his wife.  He's slowly becoming the father he always hated to his two sons yet he won't accept that and thus refuses to accept his fathers attempt to reconcile.  Wilson plays Richie, the tennis star who hit a slump after his adopted sister Margot marries Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) and thus becomes somewhat of a hermit.  Paltrow plays Margot, the playwright who's estranged from her family and quite the downer.  Together with their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) they make up one of the most eccentric families the screen has ever seen, but they are certainly one of the most entertaining.

Along with his sidekick Pagoda (the hilarious Kumar Pallana), Royal tries his hardest to reach his families hearts, albeit going about it in all the wrong ways, but he must contend with Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), Etheline's fianc, who is determined to make his efforts fail.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast (Hackman, Paltrow and Stiller stealing most of the show) and a hilarious car crash scene involving family friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) that had me reeling, `The Royal Tenenbaums' is a unique comedy that is sure to please and be remembered for time to come.

I remember watching it with my mother, and when Margot was soaking in the bathtub and being moapy, it seemed just like how I was at that age (I always liked to write.)  Now I am older, and I still like Margot Tenenbaum.  Her mod dresses are lovely.  I feel like she was painted a little 2 dimmensional though.  They should have focused a little more on her prior marriage ect and a little less on her angst.  Not that I do not enjoy angst, it's just that Margot came off as a little bit of an angst write stock character.

But more important than that, I find myself liking movies mostly for the atmosphere.  The mood The Royal Tenenbaums set can be very lovely.  The childlike portraits of Margot that Richie drew were so very wonderful.  I wish I could draw like that.  Sometimes TRT is sucessful at making the storybook childish feel and it's 5 stars, but other times it gets a little slow.  I didn't like hearing about their mother and her book writing.

Richie Tenenbaum I loved though~  I loved his life long love of Margot too.  That was very sweet.  See it just for him!  He is a very sweet man.  Though I feel like something about his sudden attempted suicide seemed off.  Also I should not include this in such a professoinal review, but I did not find him attractive without his crazy facial hair.  It was a bit upsetting when he shaved it off.

Chaz was...well, I wish he had had a different actor.  Someone like Ben Stiller shouldn't be in lovely movies like this.  He really brought it down.

Wes Anderson's music selection couldn't have been better~  Being a fan of  60s music I really enjoyed this.  It's very hip music, with the exception of Elliot Smith.",1166572800,5,1734,4.371069182389937

He fakes terminal stomach cancer as an excuse to spend time with them, until they realize that he's eating too much to actually have the disease, which makes him seem even more deceptive. Not to include any spoilers, I'd have to say this this movie kept me more pleasantly amused than would a movie filled with user-friendly, albeit unrealistic, drama and diversions. It's a simple tragedy of too 'little, too late' when Royal tries to repair family ties. Another plus: the cinematography and soundtrack are brilliant and fitting.

Other reviews called the movie boring. My advice is to stay tuned in: the first 20 minutes or so deals with the background of the family and offers seemingly unnecessary details that actually recur later in the movie. Truth be told, I felt like the movie was going nowhere as the family was being described, but there is a plot: their reunion. If you pay attention to their minimal quirks and mannerisms, especially the warm, amusing, perpetually flustered Royal Tenenbaum, you'll find many chuckles in the utter humanity of the characters. Look at this movie as a drama, not a comedy: there are sad parts, and there are funny parts.

Other reviews also hailed the characters' actions as inconsistent. It's true that some of their breakdowns seem driven by whim, but the movie focuses little on the events leading up to their major actions and more on the moment they occur in. View the movie as cut for time: it's not a play-by-play of their lives, it's a story that jumps from their childhood to their adulthood, only including major events. There's an air of ridiculousness throughout the movie, so I felt that the actions being so magnitudinal with such little provocation was a stroke of comedic genius. I think the intelligence of the characters lies in their ability to discreetly pick up on each other's quirks and their own OCD-like habits, which makes up for any pretentious banter. Sure, the movie wasn't exactly a comedy or a highly intellectual masterpiece, but to me that's a case of misdirected hype.

Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children: Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson). In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families: Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen. That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten. Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died. What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures. Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right. With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.

I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and have seen all four of his films. THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture. However, it is my least favorite of his movies. Like all Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue. The film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy. Yet, the film just didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures. I really don't know why that is. That's not to say THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not. In addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant set designs, etc. I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead.",1158710400,,1960,4.9393939393939394

Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging ""comic"" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too. ASAP.",1157932800,6,533,5.1976744186046515

The Paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes, despite her promotion as a ""prodigy"". The purported love triangle has no apparent basis, in other words, the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence. The problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional, creative writers.

The use of color-Kubrick

1699383,5,B0000640VJ,"After reading a few of the reader reviews, I felt I had to voice my opinion seeing as there seems to be quite a bit of debate. I am usually not a fan of dark, understated films. I'm a typical teenager in that I generally prefer predictable, mainstream comedies and romances.

That being said, I found The Royal Tenenbaums to be a gem. It has easily become one of my all-time favourite films. While others list the film's subtleness and what can be perceived as slowness as being one of the key negative aspects of the film, I think this subtleness it what makes this film so very, very charming. True, it is not easy to like. It takes repeated exposures to appreciate it, so please do not judge it immediately. I couldn't even sit through my initial viewing of this film. In fact I turned it off within half an hour. Gradually, though, when I gave it another chance, I began to realize how striking and poignant this film really is.

I honestly don't consider this film as a comedy, and if truth be told didn't realize it was marketed as a comedy until I came to Amazon today. Maybe that is why so many people dislike this film - as purely a comedy; it is not a strong film. Elements of comedy are present but in my opinion, this film is about so much more than that. All elements of the human condition are represented in this film, and are delivered in such a quirky and stylistic fashion that I find it difficult not to be enamored.

I could speak endlessly about the music used in this film. For me, connection to music can amplify each and every emotion, and the music choices in this film are flawless. ""Me and Julio down by the Schoolyard"" by Simon & Garfunkle perfectly encapsulates the joie de vivre and freedom of the scene as Royal becomes acquainted with his grandsons. I find it impossible to watch that scene without a smile. Conversely, the choice of ""Needle in the Hay"" by Elliott Smith during Richie's suicide attempt scene never fails to bring me to tears.

To me, the film's finest, although undeniably darkest scene is Richie's shaving of his hair and beard and subsequent suicide attempt. The use of gloomy lighting and camera angles plus the incredibly appropriate and haunting music, all combine to produce a beautiful yet amazingly heartbreaking scene. It was also wonderful to see such prolific actors portraying such left-of-center characters. In fact, everything about this film is appealingly unexpected.

This film is full of touching moments and it is only fitting that the ending is not all neatly wrapped up, because life is not like that. Chas is still dealing with grief, Royal never did become a completely changed man and the relationship between Richie and Margot is far from perfect. But it is precisely this inherent imperfection that makes this film so entirely perfect.",1145318400,5,2810,4.645875251509055

But The Royal Tenenbaums bored me like no other movie.  No emotions, laughs, or even sly chuckles.  Almost a chuckle when he threw his racket.  So why am I so out of touch?  Maybe I am too dull.

The usual Anderson actors are in it again (the Wilson brothers, Murray, Huston) but the best performance is by Gene Hackham.

As in all the other movies music is chosen meticulously again and really fits with the rest. The haunting voice of Nico is very nice when you hear it.

Another thing that makes a Wes Anderson movie a Wes Anderson movie is the camerawork. Usually a still camera with very short shots. Sometimes even more like a photograph. There is never a lot of movement but it works so well.",1131926400,4,775,4.594202898550725

It may sound like a joke, but I'm being completely serious.  I normally cannot stand either of these actors because they tend to just play themselves in every movie that they make.  But THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS creates an intelligent enough comedy to prevent them from lapsing into their comedic stupidity.

THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS chronicles the sad story of a family of very talented children (Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, & Gwenyth Paltrow) whose lives are torn apart by the parental failings of their father.  Gene Hackman is perfectly cast as the ""Royal"" Tenenbaum, an actor who is perfectly able to portray a man who is both sympathetic and despicable at the same time.  What impressed me about THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is that it manages to send you all over the emotional map.  Rather than just stick to laughs, this film quickly establishes itself as something else entirely.

This is a very weird and striking comedy: delightfully hilarious at one moment and disturbingly awkward and depressing the next.  It definitely explores the whole range of human emotion: all eight octaves.  I enjoyed its humor and range; however, it seems  clear to me that viewers will either love it or hate it.  The film leaves room for a variety of interpretations and, while good, it is not good enough to silence those who criticize it for being somewhat awkward.  Nevertheless, I hope we see more from Wes Anderson and maybe, just maybe, he can make me happy by leaving out his old college buddies just once and let me fully enjoy the movie.",1131235200,6,1671,4.841549295774648

Anderson's packrat mentality helped make ""Rushmore"" fun to look at, but in ""Tenenbaums"" it gets the better of him, spilling over and defining his relationship with his characters. There are no human beings in the movie. Yes, actors occupy sets, wear costumes, say lines. Sometimes they smoke cigarettes. But they have no more inner flame than the knick-knacks poised to engulf them. Symmetrical framing, used effectively in ""Rushmore"", takes on a creepy, compulsive air: in practically every shot, these Glass wanna-bes look like objects carefully arranged on a shelf. Angelica Huston, at least, manages to invest her role with a fluttery vulnerability, but she's operating in a vacuum.

1699451,5,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" exists on a knife edge between comedy and sadness. There are big laughs, and then quiet moments when we're touched. Sometimes we grin at the movie's deadpan audacity. The film doesn't want us to feel just one set of emotions. It's the story of a family who at times could have been created by P.G. Wodehouse, and at other times by John Irving. And it's proof that Anderson and his writing partner, the actor Owen Wilson, have a gift of cockeyed genius.

The Tenenbaums occupy a big house in a kind of dreamy New York. It has enough rooms for each to hide and nurture a personality incompatible with the others. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), the patriarch, left home abruptly some years before and has been living in a hotel, on credit, ever since. There was never actually a divorce. His wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) remains at home with their three children, who were all child prodigies and have grown into adult neurotics. There's Chas (Ben Stiller), who was a financial whiz as a kid; Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), who was adopted, and won a big prize for writing a school play, and Richie (Luke Wilson), once a tennis champion.

All three come with various partners, children and friends. The most memorable are Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), a bearded intellectual who has been married to Margot for years but does not begin to know her; Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), who lived across the street, became like a member of the family, and writes best-selling Westerns that get terrible reviews; Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), who was Etheline's accountant for 10 years until they suddenly realized they were in love, and such satellites as Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal's faithful servant (who once in India tried to murder Royal and then rescued him from ... himself ...) and the bellboy Dusty (Seymour Cassel), who impersonates a doctor when Royal fakes a fatal illness.

Trying to understand the way this flywheel comedy tugs at the heartstrings, I reflected that eccentricity often masks deep loneliness. All the Tenenbaums are islands entire of themselves. Consider that Margot has been a secret smoker since she was 12. Why bother? Nobody else in the family cares, and when they discover her deception they hardly notice. Her secrecy was part of her own strategy to stand outside the family, to have something that was her own.

One of the pleasures of the movie is the way it keeps us a little uncertain about how we should be reacting. It's like a guy who seems to be putting you on, and then suddenly reveals himself as sincere, so you're stranded out there with an inappropriate smirk. You can see this quality on screen in a lot of Owen Wilson's roles--in the half-kidding, half-serious way he finds out just how far he can push people.

The movie's strategy of doubling back on its own emotions works mostly through the dialogue. Consider a sort of brilliant dinner-table conversation where Royal tells the family he has cancer, they clearly don't believe him (or care), he says he wants to get to know them before he dies, the bitter Chas says he's not interested in that, and Royal pulls out all the stops by suggesting they visit their grandmother. Now watch how it works. Chas and Richie haven't seen her since they were 6. Margot says piteously that she has never met her. Royal responds not with sympathy but with a slap at her adopted status: ""She wasn't your real grandmother."" See how his appeal turns on a dime into a cruel put-down? Anderson's previous movies were ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) and ""Rushmore"" (1998), both offbeat comedies, both about young people trying to outwit institutions. Anderson and the Wilson brothers met at the University of Texas, made their first film on a shoestring, have quickly developed careers, and share a special talent. (That Owen Wilson could co-write and star in this, and also star in the lugubrious ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" is one of the year's curiosities.) Like the Farrelly brothers, but kinder and gentler, they follow a logical action to its outrageous conclusion.

Consider, for example, what happens after Royal gets bounced out of his latest hotel and moves back home. His wife doesn't want him and Chas despises him (for stealing from his safety deposit box), so Royal stealthily moves in with a hospital bed, intravenous tubes, private medical care, and Seymour Cassel shaking his head over the prognosis. When this strategy is unmasked, he announces he wants to get to know his grandkids better--wants to teach them to take chances. So he instructs Chas' kids in shoplifting, playing in traffic and throwing things at taxicabs.

""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is at heart profoundly silly, and loving. That's why it made me think of Wodehouse. It stands in amazement as the Tenenbaums and their extended family unveil one strategy after another to get attention, carve out space, and find love. It doesn't mock their efforts, dysfunctional as they are, because it understands them--and sympathizes.",1111968000,86,4996,4.912322274881516

1699457,3,B0000640VJ,"The first half hour of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS might make you believe that this may turn out to be a terrific movie. Director-coscreenwriter Wes Anderson creates a fascinating, hilarious dysfunctional clan in the Tenenbaums, especially with the three children, who are all geniuses in one way or another, but have all burned out for different reasons. The style of the movie is also initially exhilarating, too: it's presented as a kind of cinematic novel, with a prologue introducing the main characters (via narration by Alec Baldwin), eight chapters, and then an epilogue.

Despite a blazing start, though, the final impression I get from THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is of a movie that strikes me as a too precious and self-indulgent for its own good. This story of how the Tenenbaum patriarch (Gene Hackman), who separated from the family when the children were young, and who reappears and helps to reenergize their lives, could have made more a genuinely touching story. Instead, the story is undermined by Wes Anderson's apparent desire to show everyone that he is such a clever guy. The obviously-composed frames, the laid-back direction of the actors---those kinds of mannerisms all add up to overwhelm the emotional substance of a story. By the end I didn't feel genuine poignancy in the final image---just the impression that, had Anderson dialed down some of the wackier elements of the plot (really, did we absolutely need Richie Tenenbaum's almost-incestuous lust for adopted sister Margo?) and made less of a show out of cuteness and wit, this might have been a much more effective movie. It's rather a shame. Wes Anderson was much more successful in his previous film RUSHMORE in balancing both his idiosyncratic style and the emotional content of its plot. I was truly touched at the end of that film in a way that I wasn't with this one.

Still, I can't say that this is a terrible movie. As in RUSHMORE, Anderson's refusal to descend into insufferable bathos with plots that invite sentimental treatment is admirable. He is admittedly a fresh director, with a distinctive, offbeat style that will probably appeal to some people more than it does to others. And, among its large ensemble cast, there is one consistently great performance in this movie, Gene Hackman's portrayal of the family patriarch Royal Tenenbaum. I'll leave it to others to analyze why his performance works all the way through; for me, though, I just found him a sheer pleasure to watch. He gives such a complete performance compared to some of the one-note portrayals of the other actors that you truly miss him when he is not onscreen. His great performance is not enough, though, to save what is ultimately a disappointing movie, one that is not without its occasional charms but is overall perhaps too self-consciously clever and offbeat for its own good.",1105401600,12,2840,4.976842105263158
1699458,5,B0000640VJ,"I love this movie. I love the small, subtle moments - the cigarettes hidden behind the brick; the moment when Gwyneth Paltrow steps off the bus and everything slows down; Owen Wilson's pronunciation of the words ""obsolete dialect""; and I especially love the character Dudley, not least because I am now able to describe moments of social awkwardness as ""Dudleyesque"" to those in the know.

I noticed a lot of reviewers here said things like ""Didn't get it,"" and ""Wasn't funny at all."" Probably like them, I initially thought this was some sort of screwball, zany comedy, because that's what the trailers led me to expect. (I think the words ""You'll laugh your pants off"" may have been involved, but I might be imagining that.)

I don't think I've ever seen a more innapropriate ad for a film in my life. (Except perhaps once, when the write-up for the long-forgotten train-wreck ""Twin Town"" was described as the Welsh version of ""Trainspotting"" - needless to say, it aint.)

This is not ""Dodgeball"". This is not ""Anchorman"". This is subtle, intelligent, moving entertainment, seeped in irony. Actually there's such an abundance of irony some ultra-jaded reviewers don't like it for precisely that reason. But if you want something graceful and amusing and a little sly - watch ""Tenenbaums"". You won't be disappointed.

A little footnote. A month after watching this film - in a bizarre coincedence - I met a guy who, I swear, was exactly the same as Bill Murray's character. He had the beard, he had the jacket, he was a professor (in England) - I'm not sure of what. It was a moment that was entirely wasted, because no-one I was with had seen ""Tenenbaums"".",1105315200,6,1658,4.786713286713287
1699469,4,B0000640VJ,"I waited a long time after the release of this film to finally see it and I wish I'd looked at it sooner.  Wes Anderson is an original artist in a world full of sequels and spinoffs of comic books and TV shows.  That he attracts first-rate casts to help him realize a vision says plenty about Anderson's talent.  Gene Hackman is at the top of any credible list of ""World's Great Actors,"" and he gives what seems like his 100th superb performance here.  As the central figure of the movie Hackman has a lot on his shoulders and he carries it off with style, timing, and heart.  The other standouts in the cast are Danny Glover and Anjelica Huston, but really, the movie works best as an ensemble piece: these folks have great chemistry together on screen and they help Anderson (and cowriter Owen Wilson) realize his vision.  In addition to being creative and funny, sometimes in an unexpected and silly way, the film is emotionally moving at several points, most of them involving Hackman.  The montage with Gwyneth Paltrow growing up as a girl who likes her cigarettes and her men (and women!) is wonderful on its own, but Bill Murray's reaction to it takes the scene to the level of priceless.  On the down side, the movie's visual style and structure often are contrived and the style draws too much attention to itself, but these are the flaws of someone learning to develop a vision.  Anderson enjoys movies and moviemaking, and we enjoy his enthusiasm as he scores key scenes with well-known and not-so-well known music.  My favorite: using Bob Dylan's instrumental from the Sam Peckinpah film ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" for the sequence in which cheeseburger-eating-stomach-cancer-faker Royal (Hackman) gets booted from the Tenenbaum residence.  Some might say Anderson is self-indulgent; I think he enjoys popular culture and people and does a fine job of helping his audience share the enjoyment.  Now, for the extras: outstanding.  Major cast members get interviewed, there are some choice outtakes and a few surprises, and even the covers of books that the characters in this very text-oriented movie have written (for example, ""Old Custer"" by Owen Wilson's character Eli Cash, a bestselling author with elements of Tom Wolfe, Hunter Thompson, Richard Brautigan, and others thrown in.).  In sum, Royal Tenenbaums documents the emergence of a potentially great director, Wes Anderson.  His humor and perspective will not work for everyone, and certain elements of the film feel like inside jokes for those who were involved, but the movie will hold up on repeated viewings.  It will also stand as one of the movies that shows Gene Hackman's skills to great effect, and that's saying a lot considering his track record.  The Hack-Man puts on a clinic in acting that expresses the symbiosis of hilarity and tragedy that we know as real life.",1105315200,,2854,4.8879668049792535
1699470,5,B0000640VJ,"It's tempting to say that some people love this movie and others hate it because some understand irony and others don't.  But actually, I think there's a more charitable explanation:

In order to ""get"" (and love) Wes Anderson, I think it really helps to have been born between about 1960 and 1975.  That is: you really  need to think of American culture in the '60s, '70s and  very early '80s as the time of your lost childhood.  For me, the lime-green rotary phone on Raleigh St. Clair's desk is enough to bring me to tears.  The Stones albums, the board games, the CP/M Minicomputers in _The Life Aquatic_...Wes loves the stuff that surrounded us as kids in post-Boomer America and is now mostly gone, or kicking around in basements and thrift stores.  Actually, I wish I could be the guy he hires to go out and find that stuff.  But it's not just material culture; it's the feel of '70s books and movies too, Max Frisch's _Montauk_, John Irving's books, Salinger's stories (okay, they're from the '50s and '60s, but the feeling is there), _Harold and Maude_ and _The Hotel New Hampshire_.  We were kids in a time when America was disappointed, but thoughtfully so (for the most part, anyway).  Wes understands that.

1699471,3,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a mildly amusing parody on a wealthy dysfunctional family that has rapidly declined.  Although the cast is loaded with stars such as Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Bill Murray, somehow neither of them really extend themselves as overly amusing.  Gene Hackman's character is notably disliked particularly with many of his insensitive comments to his children when they were growing up.  He abandons the family during a critical part of their lives and tries to re-enter later on when he needs their support.

During this reentry period there are a few amusing moments.  However there is plenty of bitterness and deceit.  However, there are some moments when the family does strive to be whole and that does balance the film from being overly dreary.

My overall impression is that the film has moments of interest but moments of annoyance.  Three stars on this five star scale seem about right.",1104019200,2,934,5.01948051948052

And some things do finally happen after what seems an unpleasant eternity, but the film tries to pull of the nearly impossible trick of making us laugh while everyone on screen is on the verge of tears.

Coming off the charmingly quirky ""Rushmore,"" director Wes Anderson's previous calling card, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is again quirky but not charming in the least.  At least the music is excellent and the cinematography first-rate.  There are a few funny moments scattered through this story of a disbarred lawyer and his estranged family, with his three brilliant children who grew up and retreated so far into themselves you'd need a pick and axe to find them.  The humor is blended with such misery (and not much pathos) that it's blunted beyond recovery.  And by the way, ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" also failed to make incest funny.

1699474,5,B0000640VJ,"So many people wanted to like this movie, and so few did. So few really seem to understand what Wes Anderson does. Why is that? People aren't stupid, they just have preconceptions. People go to see a Wes Anderson movie, thinking they're going to see a comedy. This movie isn't a comedy. It's a highly idiosyncratic drama that happens to be funny. If people approached him that way, I think they'd leave happier. To be fair, the trailers for this movie were horrible: they chopped it up and tried to make it look like something it wasn't: a comedy.

Wes Anderson is that rarest of filmmakers: subtle. He also manages to be idiosyncratic and clever without being derivative, crass, expoitative, or facile. You know, like Quentin Tarantino, Hack of the Century. It's no surprise that Tarantino's best film, Jackie Brown, is the one that most eschews the stylistic tics he's best known for. I actually enjoy his films, but he's had the unfortunate side effect of creating a vast undead legion of imitators. For that alone, he's the worst thing to happen to film in many many years. QT's films are essentially the cinema equivalent of Bazooka Joe: a plastic brick wrapped in a shiny, appealing wrapper.  Anyway, this review is supposed to be for Tenenbaums...

Like most Anderson films, this is about fathers and families, and it's remarkably sensitive. Don't make the mistake of seeing only the eccentricities: those are just a storytelling technique. This movie is ultimately about squandered potential, self-sabotage, and that painful realization that you're NOT a genius. The Tenenbaums had the childhood we all though we deserved: adulation and recognition. They lost it, and the film is really about coming to terms with that loss, and constructing an identity outside of those unreal expectations. For Royal, it's about reclaiming something he gave away, something his self-image kept him from knowing that he wanted. The point is that all too often it takes staggering, heart-breaking failure before we'll really confront ourselves.

The various quirks of the characters, while well drawn and amusing, are there for a purpose: they are magnifications of the idiosyncrasies we all have. Dramatically, they also save it from being yet another of those student-film talky ""family dysfunction"" movies. Despite their cartoonish natures, I find the interaction of the characters much more true to life than most such dramas.

Anderson is a remarkable director: his attention to detail and ability to sympathize with the characters, as well as wring the most from his actors, is truly admirable. But he's best as a writer. The script, just as in Rushmore, is remarkably subtle. All the conversations are oblique and rich in subtext. Again, this is so important: pay attention to people, and you realize that we seldom ever say exactly what we're thinking, and when we do, we may not really mean it. Nothing in this film is unmotivated, random, or false. And most importantly, the style, which is pronounced, serves the story, not vice versa.

If you're sick of McMovies, music videos blown up to 90 minutes, and trivia rants mixed with violence and served up as cinema, by all means check out this movie. If you think Reservoir Dogs was the best thing to ever happen to film, pass on by, and God help you.",1102464000,8,3301,4.960216998191682

1699476,4,B0000640VJ,"I am not going to run through the plot and ruin it but even if I were to I hardly doubt that actually viewing the film would be worthless after hearing all about it.  Instead I will simply comment on the movie's serveral strengths, and few weaknesses.

I first must comment on the beautiful direction and script supplied by Wes.  The script is something to really admire.  It is funny, it is sad, it is the true feeling of life.  Wes seems to capture life in his movies as good as some of the best writers of the 20th century with a keen sence of observation and likeness of his viewers.  The filmography is simply stunning.

With this being an ensemble film I also have to say that the interwoven storylines are done so brilliantly and not to leave any thing undiscovered, resolved at the film's conclusion.  The acting is some of the best I have ever seen from an ensemble cast.  No one really produces a unsuccessful performance.  I do however think that while I like Ben Stiller's acting for the most part, his almost too dynamic character sort of ruins his role for me on grounds of unbelievablity.  Also Glover simply doesn't make an impression on me.  He never really does.

That aside, I love the performances of everyone else.  To me though, even though Gwen Platrow, Owen Wilson, and Gene Hackman were oscar worthly, Luke Wilson shines way above all the rest.  The three best scenes in the film all involve him.  My third favorite: when he lets the bird go one last time at the end, my second when he lies in the tent with Platrow and tells her how he has always loved her, and my favorite in the movie and quite possibly in all of film, the scene where he shaves his beard and attempts suicide all while ironically Elliott Smith's masterful 'Needle in the Hay' plays.  That scene is so bizarre and so chilling that I hardly can explain its effects on me.

My reason for only 4 stars is that the introduction (the first learning of the characters) is less than spectatular and unfortunately fails to really hold my attention after first veiwing.  A solid 4 stars though.  No doubt this is sorely underrated.",1101254400,7,2117,4.492146596858639

Owen Wilson is odd man out in this caper, playing the next door neighbor who so badly wanted to be part of the Tenenbaum household that he spent most of his time there, much to the chagrin of Richie, who quietly harbors his love for adopted sister, Margot, played to dead pan perfection by Gwynneth Paltrow.  It was fascinating to read that Owen Wilson had such a major part in the making of this film, including co-writing it with Anderson.

 I disagree. I think this movie is for every taste, it's just that those who usually aren't used to movies like Tenenbaums should watch it more than once.

 I'm a quirky person, so of course this movie struck me the first time viewing it. But although the quirkiness was what drew me into the movie, after viewing it several times later (okay, 30 times), I realized how beautiful of a job Anderson did with writing (along with Owen Wilson) and directing the movie.

 You can't just watch this movie just for entertainment. You have to study this movie. Understand what Anderson is trying to convey through the dialogue. It's amazing.

 Despite its quirkiness, we can relate to the characters. It's a great character-study movie. The movie is more focused on how the characters progress in the movies rather than how the plot progress, which makes it all the better to enjoy to watch.

 This movie is my favorite of all time because of those elements. Not only is it packed in hilarity, it's also packed with great cinematography and it's apparent that Anderson studied classic films closely to inspire him to write and direct so brilliantly.

 Many people say that Rushmore is better, but usually when I ask them how many times they've seen Tenenbaums, they usually say only one time. If anyone sees this movie another time, I'm sure they'd begin to realize where I'm coming from about this movie.",1090368000,10,1455,4.73015873015873

The story has been described by many people, so I will just say that this is one of those movies where the story dosen't really matter because you are so enamored by the characters.  This movie is basically a character study but with a whole family and their various friends, children, and spouses.  Everything about the set, the costumes, and the way the actors portray their characters is  fairy tale like and almost seems like a metaphor for something more ordinary, but is just beautiful and filled with tiny details that draw you into their world with an open heart.
  The movie is wonderfully written and acted, although some people may not get the humor or may be expecting easy laughs, so they will not really ""get"" or enjoy the movie because they don't know what to think. For the most part, this movie does not dictate to the audience what is funny about it, and it does not dictate who to like and what to think about the film.  This leaves some less patient audience members feeling unsatisfied and like they have missed something, which they have.  Many people I know who have seen this movie are expecting Ben Stiller ala There's Something About Mary, or Bill Murray ala Ghostbusters, but this is not the usual ""popular comedy"" sort of performance these actors give in this movie.  Bill Murray says nothing directly funny at all, he just mopes around with a beard and a patient named Dudley, which is only funny if you take his character as a whole and stop to notice the subtle humor in his character and how he reacts to what goes on.

1699558,5,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson has cemented his reputation as one of the premier directors of his generation with this finely crafted film.
Superb acting and cinematography are often coupled to create incredibly emotional sequences. A great example is Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow's reunification after many years apart. Wilson's awkward posture and Paltrow's hazy longing are emphasized beautifully with a mesmerizing slow motion shot that speaks more clearly about their relationship than even the best dialogue ever could. This is but one example of many. Every actor in this film delivers a top-notch performance and camera work is frequently unconventional yet stunningly effective.
Each member of the Tenenbaum family is carefully developed and as the film progresses the complex web of relationships that is present within any family subtly emerge. This however, is no ordinary family. Success came to easily for the Tenenbaum's and it served as precursor to failure. The Tenenbaum children are defined by their inability to handle their shortcomings and the film's dark comedy finds its source in their respective dysfuctions.
Many reviewers have commented that this movie is intellectually over-indulgent. This may be true. While there are a few bits of slapstick comedy (mostly revolving around Ben Stiller's character) the movie's strength lies in its depth.

1699563,4,B0000640VJ,"I can understand why some people find this movie boring or uninteresting.  The first time I saw it, I thought it was so so.  Then it grew on me without having to see it again.  This movie, while not perfect, is a welcome breath of fresh air in a world of crappy Matrix sequels, Club Dreads, Jackasses (I still think the title describes the viewers, NOT the ""actors""), overrated Tarantino movies, and the plain old crap that's in Hollywood nowadays.
And yes, this movie is sophisticated humor, not sophomoric.  If you don't know what either of those words means, this movie definitely is not for you.  It's subtle, witty, and clever.  You do have to be intelligent to appreciate this movie for what it really is.  I hate to sound elitest, but people who think the American Pie movies (though humorous) are the best movies ever will not enjoy this movie.  It takes a higher level of thinking.  I know, I know, God forbid a movie makes you think, but it's good to get one of those every now and then.
One thing I'd like to say about Wes Anderson is that I really enjoyed Bottle Rocket.  People talk about Tenenbaums and Rushmore, but I think Rocket is up there with them.  I think it's the funniest of the three, not necessarily the best though.  I'd have to say Tenenbaums, in my mind, is the best.  The camera play is goddamn interesting, even funny, and the characters are some of the most rounded I've seen in recent cinema.  Yes the movie does echo the whole Catcher in the Rye mood, but in my mind that adds to the tone of the picture.
If you want cheap thrills, go somewhere else.  If you want a movie with tons of thought put into it and tons of thought emanating from it as well, Royal Tenenbaums is an excellent movie.",1080950400,7,1725,4.3974763406940065

With brilliant performances all around,a sharp,engaging script, and deliciously quirky sets,costumes and characters, The Royal Tenenbaums is a truly wonderful piece that takes a few viewings to truly appreciate, and take in all the little subtleties that make a film truly magical.
It's a film that needs to be seen to be appreciated for its dry wit and whimsical qualities. Its a film that is a  sheer joy to watch if you're a fan of movies that are slightly different.",1080691200,3,746,4.828125
1699565,5,B0000640VJ,"From the very moment it opens (with hilarious scenes of the cast members grooming themselves in various ways) you know that this is not your average film. No, it is not a film everyone will enjoy. The humor, for the most part, is subtle. The characters are quirky and story is more than a little offbeat. It's a special movie and it will take special people to enjoy it. Does that mean you are unintelligent for not enjoying it? No. What it does mean is that you don't appreciate the craft of writing and filmmaking enough to see how special this movie really is.
The sets are unique, unable to be pinned down to any single moment in time (rotary phones occupy the same desk as desktop computers). The wardrobe likewise is something special; each character really expresses himself through what he wears. One character wears the same type of dress, shoes, and hair barrette she wore when she is twelve (trying to recapture her heyday as a young genius, perhaps?). Another character dresses himself and his young sons in matching red Adidas sweatsuits so that they will be able to easily find one another in the event of a disaster. The soundtrack is a superb blending of mid 60s/70s rock (which appears to be the time period this family finds itself locked in.) And the writing...
Dozens of other people have outlined the plot, so I'll not go into it. But the writing is sharp, witty, and more than a little tongue-in-cheek. But this isn't your average comedy, striving solely for cheap laughs. There is depth here as well. You'll find yourself laughing one moment and then, just as quickly, tearing up at a certain character's heartache. The sequence in which a narrator details the early life of the Tenenbaums is especially well done.
And the acting? There is not a single sloppy performance in this movie; even the most minor characters are flawlessly played. And the main actors are excellent. I'm ashamed to say I never thought much of Gwyneth Paltrow as an actress before, but she really proves herself in this film. They are all so wonderful I can't really spotlight one actor as being ""the best"" but I will say Luke Wilson's character is probably the most loveable. Even though Richie Tenenbaum is a flawed, at times manipulative man, you find yourself rooting for him from the beginning. It makes me wonder why Luke would choose to waste his wonderful talent on such dross as ""Old School"".
In conclusion, this is not a movie for everyone. But if you like a film with underhanded humor, bittersweet romance, and eccentric characters then you will fall in love with 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. Enjoy!",1078790400,10,2604,4.725274725274725
1699566,3,B0000640VJ,"Well, I lasted through this movie recently...but just barely.  And for those of you who aren't sure, you can actually dislike this movie even if your IQ is above 85.  :)  I generally enjoy controversy in the reviews, but the elitism shown in these reviews is simply wretched.
For those who don't know, the story is about the reunion of Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) and his dysfunctional family (Huston, Stiller, Paltrow, and  Luke Wilson).  When his 3 children were young, Royal was a critical, unstable father who played favorites.  Though all of the children were geniuses, they all came undone by their 30's due to their father's dispiriting influence and mother's detached upbringing.
Right as all 3 children were hitting their lowest lows in their 30's, Royal gets kicked out of his housing because he has no money.  He schemes his way back into their lives, and so all 5 are living under one roof again, with the notorious neighbor (Owen Wilson) still nearby.  Will reconciliation ever happen?  Should it happen?  Does Royal actually care?
The movie allows the characters to breath - it allows them to be complex and mysterious and irrational.  It also allows for a subtle ironic and circumstantial humor.
However, that said, I thought the movie dragged quite a bit and was ultimately very empty.  There was little in it that engaged me emotionally; I was not drawn into any one character's plotline  (let alone all of them).  I didn't need closure because I didn't care, and I'd rather the story have ended sooner.  Even the very poignant (though twisted) moment of Luke Wilson's crisis was trivialized as things bounce back to ""normal"" so quickly.
As a final criticism, the movie had unnecessary (though brief) nudity.  I think I should have expected it in this movie, but it could have easily been left out.  All in all, some subset of movie watchers might really enjoy the unique journey of this film.  However, most people can probably pass on this film and never miss out.",1078617600,21,1981,4.827893175074184
1699567,5,B0000640VJ,"Gene Hackman never fails to amaze me!. He always seems to be in films which are quite challenging and mostly unorthodox. This film does not follow usual studio formula story of dysfunctional family with a happy ending. Oh no, this is a comedy with some quite tragic elements underpinning it. One scene depicts an attempted suicide and it is not for the faint hearted.
Hackman plays the character of a psychopathic confidence trickster extremely well. He renews contact with his family and makes concerted efforts to weasle his way back in ostensibly to have a roof over his head when he hits hard times. The most amazing element is his attempt to seek redemption from those he has wronged. Hackman acts this part so well that I could not help being drawn in by his charm.
Also check out Danny Glover's performance who makes valiant attempts to thwart him.
The narrative is reminiscent of the Magnificent Ambersons and I am sure that this film pays homage to that flawed masterpiece.

He portrays the title character, one 'Royal Tenenbaum,' and if for nothing else, see the movie solely for his character. This may be the finest movie Gene Hackman has ever made, and considering his brilliant career, that alone is high praise.

This is a great film for those of us who are sick of seeing the ""same old, same old"" in movies.  Wes and Owen's script is smart and touching, and as always with Wes's films the production design is fabulous.

It's a movie like this - is there an equal in recent history? - that gives `dysfunctional families' a bad name, lol. Is there nothing sacred anymore? ;-) Imagine something like the precocious Brady Bunch on suppressive drugs or nicotine inhalers _with lobotomies_ and viewers can readily approximate the flat, artificial and deadening lifelessness of these off-center performances, except for maybe Gene Hackman - the absolute bottom of the pit of movie viewing for some of us. Sorry, but I watch a lot of funny off-beat films (such as by John Waters) and I ultimately consider this one without any redeeming value whatsoever. I learning nothing about egocentric human nature from this film and hence my dire displeasure.

One imagines that viewers are supposed to identify with the sadistic, lobotomized dysfunctional behavior portrayed here of these ""geniuses,"" laugh at it, and somehow feel joyfully relieved to have escaped such a similar fate ourselves. What I do feel grateful for is to have finally escaped this film and survived with brain, arms and limbs intact, after watching it twice to see if I might have missed something.

The only thing more deadening than the movie itself on this two disc set are the featurettes and interviews on disc two. I can only guess at what possessed these fine renown actors (some of my favorites) to take on such a turkey of a script and then have no conceivable idea how to pull it off. Bad direction?

With such an outstanding ensemble cast, it goes without saying that the performances are flawless... including the noticeably key ""performance"" of the movie's soundtrack, which complements the film superbly and features plenty of great songs and the lovely score by Mark Mothersbaugh.
Don't expect too much from the DVD extras; there are some good interviews, but the outtakes, etc. are nothing special and the inclusion of all of Eric Anderson's drawings just seems superfluous.

I laughed one time at a line by Gene Hackman - other than that - nothing.  No interesting lines, no action, horrible acting (except for Hackman) - even the car crash scene (finally - when you are expecting some - any - action at all) at the wedding fails.  The film is just flat out Boring - with a capital B.  An unsophisticated poorly conceived project that even the big time actors involved could not save from its poor direction. Paltrow - should be ashamed.  Murray - makes you feel sorry for him as an actor - the worst role I've ever seen him in.  Hackman - tries his best to bring some life to a film and characters with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Wilson brothers - not funny or amusing.  Stiller - why demean yourself by participating in this flop?  Angelica Huston - boring, boring, boring - anyone could have played her part.

Royal, who was scheming against his children and others, realized that he has made some mistakes and wants forgiveness from his kids.

Some think it looks boring, so don't really care, but some people, like me, wondered why they chose a picture of the family. I thought it wasn't really a cover that catches your attention. I didn't rent it, but I always wondered what it was. Then it was aired on The Movie Network and let me tell you something, I LOVE THAT MOVIE. I never saw a movie of that kind, it's so original. After the third time I watched the movie, I understood the cover. The movie is all about family. Everybody in that family haves a special talent and all of them have a story. Royal wasn't there for his family, so him and his wife got separated. He lived in a hotel for a long time, until he got kicked out. He told his family that he was sick, it was the only way he could spend some time with them. Some of his kids don't want him there, he wants to get his wife back, but she's seeing someone else...So that is what the movie is all about. On the cover you can see that Royal is the only one that haves a real smile, nobody else is smilling ( well the cowboy is but he's on drugs, and is not part of the family, just a close friend). So that shows that everybody haves issues with him, but he doesnt really understand.(and sorry, I don't remember the names of the characters) His daughter on the far left, is married with the older guy on the right, but they are not really close, that's why they are not standing next to each other. The black guy, he's the one that Royal's wife is seeing, notice the hand he haves on her ? That's to show Royal that they are together now. The guy in the red adidas sport suit (Ben Stiller), see how he haves the arms around his 2 kids ? It's because he's protecting them too much(you'll see why they are dressed up like that, and why he's over protective). The guy with the bird, well that one I didn't figured him out. Well he's not looking at the camera, so maybe it's because something is on his mind(you'll see in the movie). So you can see that the cover says everything, they couldn't chosed a better one. What I liked the most about that movie, is that you see famous actors, in original characters that you usually wouldn't see them act as. It shows off they're true talents.

They would go wild over a hideous waste-o-time like BARFLY or some French flick about a plant in a window and I suspected that they'd seen so many lame Hollywood by-the-numbers movies that ANYTHING different was a masterpiece.
With ROYAL TENENBAUMS, they've actually gone beyond something different: they made a movie that's so empty, so devoid of adding up to anything that it's actually HIP.  Go figure.
I kept waiting for something to happen but then, after an hour and a half in, I realized that whatever was supposed to happen WAS happening.  Almost the entire movie feels like a lead-in setting something up.
I love Gene Hackman but he needs to do more than smoke and adjust his glasses to get an Oscar.  The Wilson brothers confused me since they, despite looking exactly like brothers, don't play brothers (wouldn't it have made more sense to have Ben Stiller play the neighbor and Luke Wilson play his part?).  Gwyneth Paltrow never goes beyond the fragile stare of all those child portraits on the wall.

This movie is about an eccentric, but applicable, family with some interpersonal issues.  The movie does not revolve around a single character, but instead revolves around a series of individuals.  The viewer comes to recognize eash character for what they are, and while some are unorthodox, ok they are all pretty unusual, he or she cannot resist developing an affinity for them.
The picture quality of this DVD is quite excellent.  I bought it used for a nominal amount, and it was well worth the money.  The extra footage included on the second disk is also worth the money.

1699657,5,B0000640VJ,"I include this film among those which do not easily fit into a category other than ""comedy."" For example, Beat the Devil (1953), A Thousand Clowns (1965), A Fish Called Wanda (1988), Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Waking Ned Devine (1998), and Gosford Park (2002). Oh sure, each has a plot of sorts but not much really happens. Several memorable characters. Highly literate dialogue. In some instances, brilliant exterior cinematography. However, in my opinion, the appeal of such films is largely explained in terms of the bizarre relationships they portray between and among characters, most of whom are oddballs. That is certainly true of the members of the Tanenbaum family, with the possible exception of Etheline (Anjelica Huston). Royal Tanenbaum (Gene Hackman) is the family's, indeed the film's gravitational center.
For reasons best revealed in the film, Royal has been alienated from his wife, two sons, and daughter for many years. A convicted felon and disbarred attorney, Royal seeks a reunion with his family for economic as well as emotional reasons. Working brilliantly with a screenplay co-authored by director Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also plays a Tanenbaum wannabe, Eli Cash), Hackman displays a full range of comic gifts previously evident in other films, notably Young Frankenstein (1974), Get Shorty (1995) and The Birdcage (1996). I hasten to add that Hackman's immense talent also allows him to invest the character of Royal Tanenbaum with dimensions and nuances of decency which (for me) offset his reckless and sometimes contemptible behavior. Royal has moments of poignancy which are almost palpable.  Perhaps these brief remarks help to suggest why I find this film so difficult to categorize. The direction is crisp and the acting consistently first-rate. The screenplay combines zany humor with human deficiencies which are at times endearing. When Royal Tanenbaum selected an epitaph for himself, he also inadvertently provided an appropriate affirmation of this film's essential spirit.
The two-disc DVD version includes several special features which include a commentary by Anderson, ""With the Filmmaker: Portraits by Albert Maysles, featuring Wes Anderson""; exclusive video interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover; and ""The Peter Bradley Show,"" featuring interviews with additional cast members.",1070496000,,2456,5.549333333333333

This film has nothing more going on in its self-satisfied little brain than a series of ultra-stylized poses and attitudes that gives the entire thing the feeling of one big in joke. The only problem is the audience isn't let in on the joke.
Though some real issues are alluded to, there's no genuine emotion, either on screen or elicited in the viewer. There's also an anything goes mentality that militates against the creation of a coherent alternate world that the stylized filmmaking is clearly aiming for.
Gene Hackman's acclaimed performance is ham on rye and the Wilson brothers' affectless performances exemplify everything that's wrong with the movie. Only the sublime Angelica Huston rises to the occasion, and indeed above it in this case.",1067904000,12,836,4.853146853146853
1699662,5,B0000640VJ,"Aaron:The past 109 mins have been the best 109 mins of probably my whole life.
Narrator: Immediately after making this statement, Aaron realized that it was true.
Wes Anderson has introduced to the world, along with writing partner Owen Wilson, some of the most ingenius and quirky characters ever! From 'Dignan' in Bottle Rocket to 'Max Fischer' in Rushmore and now 'Royal Tenenbaum'.
Gene Hackman is a great actor and has done many great performances though none have grabbed me like this. With such a cast it would be difficult for the most seasoned actor to stand out though this is exactly what Hackman does at every turn. This film belongs to Hackman and everyone else is just along for the ride.
If you have read any of my reviews you will know I am not one to go into plot details but more into why I liked or loathed a film so much, so once again I will spare you the fodder.
The Royal Tenenbaums is certainly not a film for everyone and the better for it. The characterization is only akin to The Simpsons as although these people can not be real they are oh so real. They have all the traits of people you know or have known and although they seem like parodies somehow they are not. You become totally engrossed with their lives and this is in no part due to the excellent narration as supplied by Alec Baldwin.
The interaction between the actors is phenominal, truly recalling the interaction you have with your own family and acquaintences if not less cluttered. Like Rushmore before it Anderson's film has a deeply cynical streak and is defined as a very black comedy. The atmoshere reached throughout is all encombersing, so your desire to turn it off is either non existent or heightened. This is one of those films that leaves a lasting effect no matter what you thought of it, like the aftertaste of coffee.

The Royal Tenenbaums is another feather in Wes' hat, and a great addition to any movie-lover's library.  It's a story of friendship, love, death, forgiveness, and redemption, but don't expect any of the usual Hollywood cliches to be used to express these themes.

1699677,5,B0000640VJ,"I thought ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" was an excellent film, but I can understand the naysayers. I really liked the movie the first time around, though I couldn't really tell you why. The plot of the movie isn't so intricate: the movie is essentially about an inconsiderate father who has left his family, but comes back 22 years later to save them from themselves. I really could relate to the characters in the film, seeing I come from a rather dysfunctional family, and it makes me almost cry at the end when Chaz says to his father, Royal (Gene Hackman), ""I've had a really rough year."" If you can't relate to failed geniuses, broken families, and depression, then you won't like this movie.
This movie isn't really about the plot as it is about the characters experiences and the way they deal with depression. Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) locks herself up in bathrooms all day, sitting in the tub and watching television, and she is so desperate to live a secret and detached life her family doesn't know about her somking habit and her first marriage. She dresses in girl's dresses, not wanting to grow up, but puts on tons of black eyeliner to hide from the real world.
Her brother, Chaz Tenenbaum, (Ben Stiller) ""had a preternatural understanding for international finance,"" and spent most of his childhood in his room, driving business deals. He harvests some resentment to his father for leaving he and his brother and sister, and also for his father's shooting him with a BB gun when he was young. ""Why'd you shoot me?"" Chaz asks his father later. ""It was the object of the game,"" Royal answers innocently. ""We were on the same team,"" says Chaz, who still thinks that his father loves his other brother more than he.
The last brother, Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson), is a failed tennis champion who had a meltdown in an important game. To hide from the world, he grew a thick beard and long hair, and always wore aviator sunglasses to cover his face. He secretly loves Margot, his sister, who is adopted, and this also adds to the dysfunction of the family. Also to add some laughs is Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), a pseudo-intellectual novelist who has a pretty huge drug problem. ""I've always wanted to a Tenenbaum,"" says Eli, at the end, and Royal says, ""So have I.""
This movie is very enjoyable, but doesn't have a lot of action, sex, or violence. If you are really into that stuff, you won't like ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" but if you like black comedies, this film is for you!!!",1060473600,2,2488,4.656818181818182

Royal is a sly, witty fellow who you can't help root for. His wife, played to perfection by Angelica Huston, has recently taken a man-friend(Danny Glover) that is threatening the fabric of the Tenenbaum clan...Oh by the way, they've been separated for 18 years! The Tenenbaum children are all geniuses. Chas(Ben Stiller) is a cut-throat businessman whose wife has just died in a plane crash, he is left with two school aged boys. He is just a tad high strung. Margo(Gwyneth Paltrow) is actually not a Tenenbaum, she's adopted and Royal never lets her forget it. She's a tad introverted and dark. Ritchie(Luke Wilson) is a world class tennis player who has fallen from grace. He's probably the most ""normal"" of the Tenenbaums but wait, oh yeah, he's in love with his sister!?! How does this all work? I'm not really sure but it does and does with flying colors. Owen Wilson plays Eli Cash, the next door neighbor who always longed to be a Tenenbaum.

Which is rather misleading as it was advertised as one, blame that to executives who think people will only see movies that can be defined in terms of action, comedy, romantic comedy, summer blockbuster, etc...
Some funny things happen in the movie, true.  But some exceptionaly sad things happen as well.  And some of the most gorgeous things i've ever seen in a movie take place.
The fact of the matter is, you can't define this movie in any single word terms.  The best way i can describe it is that it's a ""Real"" movie.  The plot, the acting, the characters, all these are actually real people.  These are people you could possibly meet in your life, they say things a real person would say, they do things a real person would do.  In fact Royal Tenenbaum strongly reminds me of my own father.
The term dark certainly dosnt fit as it's actually an extrodinarily hopefull movie.  All the tenenbaum children are stuck in a pit of their own despair in one form or another only to be pulled out of it by the same person who probably was most responsible for putting them there.

1699719,5,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums is set to the same wistful, sentimental tone as A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), but in many respects, the narrative structure of the movie is similar to Wes Anderson's previous film, Rushmore (1998). The latter film was structured like a play yet organized by month, while the former is arranged like a novel, complete with chapter breaks. However, Anderson and his co-screenwriter, Owen Wilson, are much more ambitious with Tenenbaums as they introduce many more protagonists, each with their own storyline. These storylines are distinctive and fully realized to such a degree that the characters develop past their eccentric quirks into emotionally attachable figures.
Tenebaums evokes the work of J.D. Salinger and his short stories about the Glass family of genius children who never really grow up. The characters in both Tenenbaums and Salinger's fiction inhabit a mythical New York City that doesn't really exist except in the romantic notions of their respective authors.
For all of its literary trappings, The Royal Tenenbaums is also very cinematic in nature. It evokes The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) with the way it introduces the Tenenbaum family (both films even use an omniscient narrator) and also feels like one of Hal Ashby's films -- in particular, Harold and Maude (1971) or Being There (1979). Anderson, like Ashby champions innocent dreamers in a cynical world that threatens to crush them.
The first disc is an audio commentary by Wes Anderson and is delivered in his trademark low-key style. He talks about the themes of Tenenbaums, recounts many anecdotes that occurred during the making of the movie and divulges all sorts arcane trivia. This is an informative commentary essential for any fan of Anderson's work.
The second disc carries the bulk of the supplemental material. There is a massive collection of stills, a spot-on parody of The Charlie Rose Show, With the Filmmaker, a 27-minute documentary that originally aired on the Independent Film Channel, and a nice collection of interviews with the cast that can be viewed individually or as a whole.
The folks at Criterion come through again with this top notch two-DVD set. Presented in a picture-perfect anamorphic transfer with a 5.1 DTS soundtrack and an excellent collection of supplemental material support a fantastic film.

The plot is loose and almost doesn't really matter, because the writing flows so well.  We never get to know any character, yet they all entertain us.
And like Rushmore, the soundtrack rules the movie.  Each and every song has its purpose.  The songs drive the plot, they give the characters as much if not more emotion than their dialogues.  Its sort of like watching the Monkees on TV.  The characters talk for a minute, then next thing you know they are up to something and the music kicks right in.
What Wes Anderson really has developed nicely throughout his oeuvre is his visual sense.  The Tannenbaums even tops the set design and composition of Rushmore.  The warm lighting, use of color, everything is set so perfectly.  If Wes can strengthen his plot structure, he could be one of the great writer/directors.",1053388800,,1076,4.798913043478261
1699724,4,B0000640VJ,"I stayed away from THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS for a few years because I was afraid it'd be an ""eccentric comedy"".  I dislike movies that treat their eccentric characters too preciously.  The characters in such movies are usually eccentric for eccentricities sake -- and they usually end up being the butt of the joke (""Oh, how weird they are!  How eccentric!"").
I'm happy to report that my prejudices against THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS were wrong.  In fact, it's quite a good movie.  I just finished watching it, and I'm still trying to get my head around why I liked it so much.
The movie is funny.  I would classify it as a comedy.  But it's definitely a character film, too.  The reason it works so well is because the characters, despite their eccentricities, are well-drawn.
But director Wes Anderson tweaks the film in such a way that makes it very interesting:  at the very beginning of the film, after an introduction that sets up the characters, Anderson shows his hand by giving screen credit to the actors (i.e. ""Angelica Houston as Etheline Tenenbaum"").  This is a litle disarming -- aren't actors supposed to ""disappear"" into the characters?  Instead, Wes Anderson trumpets their casting.
Anderson also uses a book motif throughout the film.  He flashes to pages of a ""Royal Tenenbaum"" book ... chapter one, chapter four, etc.  At first, not knowing a lot about this movie, I thought it was adapted from a novel!  No, it's another interesting way that Anderson is telling the story.
THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS reminded me a lot of an early John Irving book.  The characters are literary stars, playwrites, or geniuses.
But the crux of the film is the Tenenbaum family.  The basic story is that Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) comes back into his family's life after an absence of many years and tries to set things straight.
Wes Anderson has directed a comedy, but a very smart one.  Characters fall in holes and dogs get run over, but this movie has a heart.  I actually cried at the end when Ben Stiller's character makes his peace.  As Chas Tenenbaum, Stiller perpetually wears a red track suit (duplicated on his two children!) -- this is funny!  At a funeral, the track suit is changed ... to a black one.  Funny!  But, Chas is a well-written character too, and it is easy to understand why he acts as he does.
I almost feel as if I should see THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS again.  It's got a lot of detail to it.  However, I'm satisfied after my first viewing of it.  It's a great film.  I think I'm off to rent RUSHMORE next!",1052870400,3,2517,4.625282167042889

1699726,5,B0000640VJ,"This rates as one of my favorite movies over the last few years.  Director Wes Anderson follows up the outstanding RUSHMORE by bringing his unique vision to the dysfunctional Tannenbaum family.  Presented as a cross between a fable and a documentery, the film is both a comedy and a drama.
There are outstanding performances by Gene Hackman as the father trying to reintegrate himself into the family after years of absence, Angelica Houston playing the mother who had kept the family together and Luke Wilson, Gwenyth Paltrow and Ben Stiller as the children, all who had acheived great things in their youth only to fail upon reaching adulthood.  Owen Wilson plays the neighbor and family friend who also has acheived success as an author only to see it slip away.  Danny Glover gives an excellent performance as the accountant/suitor of Mrs. Tannenbaum. The only flaw in the film is that Bill Murray who was so great in RUSHMORE does not seem to well utilized in his charecter here as Gweyth Paltrow's suffering husband.
The humor in the film is understated and subtle with a surreal element woven into it. The jokes are not set up and then delivered, but are casually observed in the interactions of the charecters or sometimes as visuals in the background. The superb soundtrack and cinematography are essential to the success of the films mood.
I would highly recommend this, however with a warning.  If you are a fan of comedy of a broad nature or are expecting a riveting family portrait, you may be disappointed.  This is a unique film which requires the viewer to meet it on it's own terms, which is not standard Hollywood procedure.

Gene Hackman was robbed at the Academy Awards as his role as Royal may be the finest performance of his career, and undoubtedly one of the best performaces in this millenia. However, this film is not for the intellectually challenged or those of dim wit or dull perception. I guess one need possess a minimal level of cinimatic appreciation in order to grasp the brilliantly presented material served up by Wes Anderson and Luke Wilson. It's all about the subtle details; the Mansion on Archer Avenue, the 375th St. YMCA, the Gypsy Cab Service, all fictional entities set in an anachronistic Upper East Side of Manhattan.

For some people on the East coast, I am sure it is pretty similar, this movie just exaggerated it a little.

I found this movie delightfully funny, the characters have very well conveyed inner and outer conflicts, acting is superb, you'll find yourself empathizing with the characters and hoping for their successes...Tenenbaums is even more surreal and eccentric than Rushmore. Similar flavor and setting, a kind of dreamlike zen journey for meaning for various characters against a backdrop of the disillusioned/dysfunctional educated middle class, with themes of lost and found relationships/selves/true-loves.
But this depiction is subtle. In fact, the movie's greatest assets rest in the untold and unexplained bits of the film and the tongue-in-cheek stabs at all of the characters, people (with the exception of Pagoda, The Butler) who have been taking themselves way too seriously for way too long and their discomfort around their father, a man who never took anyone seriously in his life, least of all himself. The characters in Tenenbaums are kind of like caricatures
At the same time, the movie is touching in many ways, visually beautiful, and if you have any sort of taste in music, you can't help simply loving the soundtrack.

1699797,5,B0000640VJ,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is the third collaboration between director Wes Anderson and writer/actor Owen Wilson.  While it is not as perfect as their previous film, ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums is still an instant classic, with an outstanding cast at the top of their game, beautiful Cinematography & Art Direction, yet another great soundtrack, and a beautiful story about love, family and redemption.
The story of the film is thus: Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), patriarch of a family of gifted children, has been estranged from them for close to 20 years.  He has been seperated, but not divorced, from his wife for that same period of time.  All in all, it appears he could really care less about them, until he discovers that his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston), has been proposed to by her accountant, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover, in a great understated performance, probably his best since ""The Color Purple).  This stirs something in Royal, so he cooks up a scheme to get back into her and the children's lives.  He pretends he is dying.  Don't worry, it's not a spoiler, and is clear from the very beginning.
Meanwhile, the children have all grown up twisted, in their own way.  Ritchie (Luke Wilson), the oldest and Royal's favorite, was a Tennis phenom who melted down during a match and has been traveling the world on a steamer ever since, and is still clad in his tennis gear, posing for pictures as ""the 'Baumer"".  He is in love with his sister, Margot (Gweneth Paltrow), who is adopted and a perpetually depressed playwrite, who is married to Raleigh St. Claire (Bill Murray, giving yet another understated yet hilarious pefromance), a nuerologist and lecturer.  She is cheating on him with Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), Ritchie's best friend and drug-addicted English Lit professor who just gained noteriety for his book ""Old Custer"".  Finally, there is Chaz (Ben Stiller), who was always a financial wiz, and who is obssessed with the safety of his sons after his wife dies in a plane crash.  Once he moves back into their home, ther rest of the kids come back, and then Royal re-enters their lives and the movie takes off.
The film is a comedy, yes, but it is bittersweet and sad at the same time.  Each of the children is severely disfunctional, primarily because of Royal.  he characters are extreme, yes, but in a way I think the film was meant to be a portrait of any family where things get rocky, where favortisim is showed to one child over the others, where love is not in the equation.  Eventually, the film is about redemption, and not just Royal's but some other characters as well.  The story itself is beautiful and absurd enough to know that it came from the slightly skewed perspectives of Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson.
Gene Hackman would have dominated this movie had he been the only name actor cast.  I'm not saying other, lesser known actors woouldn't have been just as good.  I'm just saying that everyone else is so perfectly cast, it becomes almost forgiveable that Hackman was not nominated for an Oscar for this role.  Almost.  It's still a crime.  Royal is corrupt but likable, tactless but sweet in his own way.  Hackman takes the role and makes it his own.  Other cast standouts are Danny Glover, showing a gift for the sly comedy Anderson and Wilson are known for, Luke Wilson in his performance of Ritchie shows a range he has not been able to stretch in his Hollywood roles, and while Gweneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller also give excellent performances, special notice must be given to Kumar Pallana as Pagoda, Royal's valet, an Indian actor used in ever Anderson film, starting with ""Bottle Rocket"".  Here he is given a major role, and every one of his lines is a solid laugh.  He really shines here, and although I'm sure you won't see him until the next Anderson film, he's worth seeing here.
The score by Mark Mothersbaugh is twinkly and beautiful, as were his scores for ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"".  Mothersbaugh used to be in DEVO, and you get the impression that he and Anderson understand each other on a wierd level.  The art direction is terrific.  The Tenenbaum house looks like something out of a dream, as does the New York City Anderson shows us in the film, a gentler side to the city that is rarely seen.  The film looks terrific.
The folk at Criterion have done a great job on the Special Edition.  There are a couple of deleted scenes, an outtake or two, interviews with all the cast members that focus on their approach to the characters, two video features, one a serious look at Wes Anderson as a filmmaker, one a hilarious takeoff on Charlie Rose type shows.  There is also a large gallery of the art produced for the film.  It is simple and elegant, and captures the innocence of youth tha Anderson goes for in his early scenes in the movie.  There is also a little audio on the two bizzare paintings at Eli Cash's house that must be heard to be believed.
""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a fine film by a director who is still underappreciated by Hollywood as a whole, a director who seems to be an actor's director.  He's shown that he can get great performances out of anybody.  This film belongs on your DVD shelf.",1047254400,7,5182,4.664466446644664
1699798,2,B0000640VJ,"It's always puzzling when it comes to films how an idea that seemingly can't go wrong...does. This is exactly the case here with the ""Royal Tenenbaums"".
  There is a cast at hand which needs no introductions: Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, Paltrow etc. There is the idea of making all of them members of an ultra weird family (the Tenenbaums). This, providing the right script, should amount to a wacky comedy with subtle but also dark humor, a film that should be able to take on the best ""indies"" out there.
  But that never happens. Primarily because the biggest joke on this candidate comedy is the script itself.
  It's a story that never takes off really and tires even the most patient of viewers as they wait for something to finally happen. Hackman, as usual, produces another great performance, Angelica Houston is great, and that's about the only two reasons why i watched this film even though it drags painfully and pointlessly.
  The problem is that it doesn't matter whether you got a couple of great actors on your cast doing their darn best. The right recipe still includes having a story to go with it. The examples of films that have very good acting involved and sad storylines are many.

It seems that his character is the calm center around which all of the craziness whirls around.  Gene Hackman's performance is also wonderful.  How can a failure of a father return to his family?

1699803,4,B0000640VJ,"I put 4 stars, but this film really deserves 4.5 stars.  Wes Anderson, the critically acclaimed director of Rushmore, has served up a heartbreaking yet hilarious picture.  Brilliant dialogue, melancholy/beautiful cinematography, and one of Gene Hackman's finest performances, The Royal Tenenbaums is a terrific film.
Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum, an entrepreneur who has recently fallen on hard times.  His family hates him, he has no money, and his ex-wife (despite the fact they're not legally divorced) is about to marry the family accountant.  In one last effort to win his family back, Royal tells his ex-wife (played by Angelica Huston) that he's dying of cancer.  Soon, the entire family knows and Royal begins his task of winning his family back.
The film's greatest virtue is the characters.  Like Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, the characters are all incredibly quirky, but they're all completely relatable.  Why?  Because they're dealing with situations that we deal with everyday, and that's what makes Wes Anderson such a creative new talent.  As weird as everyone is, you really do care about what happens to them.
As I said, the film contains one of Hackman's best performances to date.  But he's not the only one.  Luke Wilson is particularly enjoyable as Richie Tenenbaum, the ex-tennis player who is deeply in love with his adopted sister Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow).  Ben Stiller gives his best performance to date as Chas, Royal's hate-filled son.  Gwenyth Paltrow gives one of her only tolerable performances ever.  Bill Murray is also hilarious as usual as Paltrow's husband.
Despite all its praise, this film is so quirky that it's unlikely to please everyone who sees it.  Quirky humor just doesn't work for some people, which is understandable.  So if you hate that kind of sense of humor, this film is most likely not for you.  That said, I love quirky humor, so if you're like me, this film is right up your alley.",1045440000,,1941,5.015625
1699804,2,B0000640VJ,"By reading these reviews, you know you're either going to think the movie is ""hilarious"", or you're going to find it getting off to a slow but mildly entertaining start, and never picking up steam. Whether you're on the side that loves it or the side that was mostly bored with it, you'll probably think it's a weird movie.
I didn't think it was weird, though I thought it was slow. After watching this movie and seeing all the rave reviews, I would've loved to have watched it with someone who actually laughed throughout the movie, just to see where it was supposed to be funny. When scenes were introduced showing potentially uncomfortable situations between the characters, like when the adopted sister confronts her brother about him being in love with her, she confronts him, and then we get a scene change, and we're left wondering what was said between the two. Maybe we're supposed to use our imagination, but I think that's a cheap way out. A pack of cigarettes drops out of her coat pocket. Her brother asks her about it. She says it's not hers, he says they fell out of her pocket, and again we cut away to another scene and we never return to that one. ""You dropped your cigarettes"". ""Those aren't mine"". ""They fell out of your pocket"". And the scene goes away.
If this is the funny dialogue, it didn't work for me. I don't get how it worked for anybody.
A handful of times I laughed out loud. Just as many times, I felt like turning off the movie. By the end, though I was involved in the movie, I felt like it was a waste of time. I was a little touched by Chas at the end. I was a little touched by the relationship between Gwyneth and Luke. It wasn't enough.
O Brother Where Art Thou was hilarious. I found this to be pretty slow.",1045267200,9,1747,4.378461538461538
1699805,4,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson, director of the excellent Rushmore, helms this near emotionally comedic masterpiece of a film.  The Royal Tenenbaums centers around Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his estranged, dysfunctional family including his ex-wife Etheline (Anjelica Houston) and his three former child genius children (Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson).  All of whom are brought back together after years of seperation when word of Royal's terminally ill status is revealed, and this is where The Royal Tenenbaums truly shines.  Anderson co-wrote with co-star Owen Wilson (as a drug addicted literary celebrity) and brings the rich, emotionally comedic story to life.  Hackman absolutely shines in his role, and the rest of the cast is great as well, although there are a certain number of parts that just seem a bit unbelieveable and sometimes the story can get a bit uneven, but the unique comedy (much like Anderson's Rushmore) make The Royal Tenenbaums a winner.  Danny Glover co-stars as Etheline's soon to be new husband which Royal must contend with, and Bill Murray also stars as Paltrow's psychiatrist husband and Alec Baldwin provides the film's narration.  All in all, The Royal Tenenbaums is a near classic comedy/drama that fans of Rushmore will enjoy, but be warned, those looking for a laugh out loud gross out comedy will be very disappointed.",1045267200,3,1364,5.23394495412844

In the traditional Anderson style, the jokes don't necessarily come off as jokes and much of the film's humor lies in the subtleties. This will please fans of previous Anderson films and of movies like ""The Big Lebowski"", but will probably cause frustration and boredom in many viewers.
The plot is centered around a fictional urban family and its illustrious history. Gene Hackman delivers a very solid performance and most of the rest of the cast is good as well. Fans of quirky and subtle humor will certainly enjoy ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".",1044835200,2,683,4.947826086956522

that said, this is the best comedy i have ever seen. after having memorized anderson's second feature-length film, Rushmore, i wasted no time seeing this movie several times in theatres and purchased the criterion collection as soon as i knew it existed.
the movie has a quality of subtle humor that still has me laughing after the numerous times i've seen it. there is enough attention to detail here that i still laugh at some oddity i missed before.
the problem that some people may have with the movie is that it's *too much like Rushmore. it does after all have essentially the same set up, in that each of the tenanbaum children come off as adult variations on max fischer, in particular luke wilson's character richie takes up the familiar thematic torch of impossible love. with all that in mind, this film seems to capitalize on the ideas used in Rushmore rather than simply appear to be hammering away at the same old story.
adding to the depth of this film is the spectacular soundtrack by mark mothersbaugh, who never ceases to amaze me with his prowess at adding to and intensifying the emotion of a scene.
if you rent the movie first, you can buy the soundtrack even before you see this movie, it has that expansive of an appeal.
it was to my sadness that gene hackman did not get nominated for best actor for his performance in this movie. it is difficult to imagine a better cast to pull of the very subtle dialogue in this movie, and if you don't like subtelty, you should probably stay away.",1044662400,,1664,4.513245033112582

First of all, although it features performances by Ben Stiller and Bill Murray, it's not a comedy. Though it has some humorous moments, it's in actuality a wry tragedy without a ""star."" As for the plot, it's comprised of the life stories of its twelve principal characters tied together by the return of the family's long-absent patriarch. You don't have to look too hard to find it.
Almost all original and intelligent films are scorned by those whose television-crippled attention spans and puerile sense of humor limit them to movies such as ""Triple X"" or ""Scary Movie.""

I love this movie so much, I can barely stand explaining why it's great.  How about the actors---What a spectacular cast.  I have trouble naming another movie with so many A list actors, all of them delivering great performances.  Not one actor steals the show, each character contributes to the whole.
Let me address problems people may have with the movie.  Don't get this movie if you think you like Ben Stiller movies.  Don't get this movie if you think you like Bill Murray movies.  Don't get this movie if you like Owen Wilson action/humor type stuff.  This movie is a quirky, off kilter, weird, and at times dark comedy.  It's not really a movie that you can throw in and have a bundle of obvious laughs like Caddyshack or There's Something About Mary.  Expect something more like Rushmore, BottleRocket, or maybe Spinal Tap.  Most of the humor in the movie is not situational or physical--most of the humor is found in the weird dialogue.  Which means you have to really pay attention to what is being said or you'll miss everything.
Anyway, I just thought that I'd tell you that not everybody dislikes this movie.  There are a lot of us cult followers who can rattle off whole minutes of the dialogue from The Royal Tenenbaums.",1043193600,2,1343,4.6118143459915615
1699858,5,B0000640VJ,"I readily admit this movie is not for everyone.  It does have a pretty skewed sense of humor, and is light on physical comedy and heavy on irony, verbal humor and hysterical costumes.
It's the story of the Tenenbaum family, headed by Royal (Gene Hackman) and his wife (Angelica Huston). In a VERY funny opening sequence, we are told the story of the early days of their children, the brilliant inventor/businessman (grows up to be Ben Stiller), the award-winning playwright (become Gwyneth Paltrow) and the tennis prodigy (grows into Luke Wilson).  These kids are supremely [messed] up, and it only gets worse when their parents split and Hackman moves out.
Many years later, Hackman finds himself down and out, and so he tells everyone that he is dieing, and naturally he is taken in (although reluctantly).  He begins to realize that he would like to ""make things right"" with his family, despite their HUGE reluctance.  But change does come, and it's sweet to see.
And this is all VERY funny.  Everyone gives fantastically funny performances, including Owen Wilson (who co-wrote) as a drugged-out family friend, Danny Glover as Angelica's current beau and Bill Murray as Gwyneth's husband.  Everyone is terrific.  The characters are all outrageous, but the performers make them touching and believable.
And Hackman was ABSOLUTELY ROBBED by not getting an Oscar nomination.  His development from beginning to end is so subtle.  We go from hate to respect over the course of the movie, and it never feels forced. The movie, for me, was full of huge laughs, but also several very touching moments, particularly with Ben Stiller, of all people.
If you enjoyed the comedies of the Coen brothers (RAISING ARIZONA, for example) you will probably like this.  If you enjoyed RUSHMORE or ELECTION, you will certainly like it.  If the absolute height of comedy for you are any of the scores of Saturday Night Live spin-off movies, or perhaps DUMB AND DUMBER, then stay away.",1043107200,,1965,4.960365853658536

1699861,5,B0000640VJ,"Some said Wes Anderson got cocky. He had just directed two wildly popular indie films ('Bottle Rocket' and 'Rushmore') and wanted to do something big. With a big ensemble cast and a better budget, Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have delivered the funniest movie in years, and one that will definately be remembered.
Royal Tenenbaum (played with pinache by Gene Hackman) has spent the last 22 years of his life in a hotel after an ugly seperation from his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston). Etheline raised their kids in the house at 111 Archer Avenue with strange results; the children are brilliant, if not a bit eccentric. Chas was buying and selling real estate in his early teens, Margot (the adopted one) wrote successful plays and got a $50,000 grant in the 9th grade, and Richie was a tennis pro at a very young age.
Years later, after Chas' (Ben Stiller) wife dies in a plane crash that he survived, he moves back to the house at 111 Archer with his mother. When Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) hears of this, she moves back as well, as she's unhappy with her marriage to the neurologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Richie (Luke Wilson), who has been traveling abroad on a cruise ship for many years, returns home also. Even childhood friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) comes back.
When Royal hears that everyone is back together, he wants to get to know them and make amends for his past inadequacies. This is not an easy thing, because the whole family (with the exception of Richie) distrusts him. So, he lies to Etheline and tells her that he is dying, and wants to spend the last 6 weeks of his life with the children. Chaos (and subsequent hilarity) ensues when Etheline's latest suitor, accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), exposes Royal as a fraud.
This is in all actuality a dark comedy. There are several references to death and even a graphic suicide attempt. You're asking yourself, 'how can this be funny?'. To tell you the truth, you have to see it for yourself. Like TV's 'Everybody Loves Raymond', much of 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is predicated on reaction and subtlety. The quirky characters are endearing and the relationships between those characters are even juicier. for example, Margot is married to Raleigh, but is having an affair with Eli. Eli's best friend Richie has loved his adopted sister Margot ""since forever"". See what I mean?
If you enjoyed Wes Anderson's last two films, you'll definately like this one. Fans of Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, or the Wilson brothers must own this movie. The acting is great, the story is brisk, and the comedy is off the charts. Add this to your collection today. You will NOT be disappointed.",1042934400,,2663,4.778741865509762

The characters are so rich with personality, quirkiness and madness - I loved it. I thought Gene Hackman did a wonderful job as a father that would if he could..all the actors in the movie did a fantastic job.
If you love originality, off beat humor and something different definitely get this. Otherwise, stick to Sandler movies for more obvious humor. I've recommended this movie to people who don't get quirky humor so it is good to ask yourself before purchasing if you like mainstream humor and that's it..if so- don't get this.
The storyline is interesting and it's storybook approach is adorable and intriguing. It's a must see if you are a Bill Murray fan or loved Rushmore.",1042675200,,796,4.77536231884058

Although they are both works of genius, The Royal Tennenbaums is indeed my favorite.  The subtle characters and witty dialogue are beyond comparison.  God is indeed in the details, from the paintings in Eli's living room to the 375th Street Y.  The Royal Tenenbaums is sublime; it's at a level of quality that all movies should aspire to reach.  In addition, the criterion collection DVD allows you to see just how much thought and preparation went into every aspect of the movie, especially the details of the set.  I highly recommend owning this DVD.",1042070400,,651,4.767857142857143

1699895,5,B0000640VJ,"I have been forever searching for the ultimate dark comedy that went above and beyond all the others. A few came close, but this is the film I was waiting for the whole time! Most dark comedies usually take place all at night, which is fun for a while, but gets old. Just because a movie has a twisted sense of humor, doesn't mean it has to be night all the time! This is the movie that steps aside and says, ""Like me for what I am. I'm different.""
The whole cast shines in the film that finally fufills dark comedy lovers. I don't recall a single scene that is dark, the whole film is presented in bright, beautiful pastels. It's certainly not for everyone, it is more than twisted. It makes you laugh and cry without trying. My personal favorite character was Chas (Ben Stiller) not just because I like him as an actor, but because his charcter had so much depth and layers. Although, I'm not saying anything bad about everybody else.
The DVD is just what the film deserved...bulky, beautiful, and loaded with extras. We get the full widescreen here, not some cheap immitation. Everything is great, and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. When this film was originally released, I had wanted to see it, but never got around to doing so. I would actually like to thank Daniel Radcliffe (a.k.a. Harry Potter) for reccomending this, because I had forgotten all about it. It's a shame this movie wasn't all that big. Definitely a love-it or hate-it movie. But do beware there are some really awkward situations concerning love, depression, drugs, and suicide, but don't let that stop you.

1699897,5,B0000640VJ,"The Basic Plot: 22 years after leaving his wife and children, and 7 years after not talking to anyone in his family, Royal Tenenbaum has returned to the ""House on Archer Ave"", where his now grown up children have returned to, in order to try and reconnection with his children, who have disowned him, and his wife, who has been proposed to by another man.
Video:  The 2:40:1 digital transfer of the movie is stellar.  Great quality and looks great on most screens.  Once again, these things are aimed at those lucky few with widescreen monitors.  Expect awesome playback.
Audio:  Comes with Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 audio.  Talk about sweet sounding.  Whether you're playing this on a laptop or in your banging home theater, the clear center speaking audio, the right left music, and nice surround sound use makes the audio track shine.  Very clear with no odd ambient noises, clicking, or strange hissing.  And since this movie is heavily driven by music (check out the CD for this one) it's nice to know that rich sound comes through loud and clear.
Disc one Commentary:  The commentary by Wes Anderson is a great thing to see.  It's got great insight, some humor, wonderful detail, and really ties together points that seem to make sense but might need a little clarification or interpretation.  Not intrusive or pervasive, nor idiotic or pedantic like some of the more superfluous commentaries I've heard (I.E. Warwick Davis in Willow, quaint but I'd rather hear from Ron Howard thank you).
Disc 2:  This disc is packed with about 5+ hours of extras from a 30-minute long behind the scenes with the director to in depth interviews with all of the major cast members from Gene Hackman to Owen Wilson about the details of each character and their part in the whole Tenenbaum Tragicomedy.  It also includes many stills and a couple of sections that show the artwork of Eric Anderson's wall paintings that were used in the house.
The Bad:  There were only two things that bothered me.  First, if you are going to put ""outtakes"" on the box, then show some.  There were two somewhat funny shots of between take action and one REAL outtake that wasn't really that funny.  Slap on the wrist Criterion, you can do better than that.  Second, ""The Peter Bradley Show: Interviews with the other cast members"" - which is based off of ""The Peter Bradley Show"" that's used in the movie - is a waste of good DVD space.  Personally, this section did nothing for me and wasn't really all that interesting.  They could have saved the room for some actual outtakes rather than making them Easter eggs, especially in a movie that passes itself off as a comedy, even if it's a dark one.  Hell, Death to Smoochy had more outtakes!
The Final Word:  Minor issues aside, this is one that should be in every DVD collection.  A great film and a great DVD set.  Worth the money!",1041465600,,2854,4.648702594810379
1699898,5,B0000640VJ,"My love of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson movie began with Rushmore.  His style is enjoyable to watch.  Their writing is great.  I love their characters and plots.  They are complex and very thought provoking. The Royal Tenenbaums is one of my favorite DVD's.  The movie is so interesting and well written.  His star power is well used.  They bring life to each character and to the movie. Criterion Collection had an excellent choice to pick this movie as an addition to their catalogue.  My favorite criterion collection special feature is commentary, unlike so many other movies where director's commentary is boring.  Directors don't talk about their idea, and direction but Wes Anderson does and is a joy to listen to.  The picture on this DVD is so perfect along with a sound track that brought my home theater to life.  I can't say enough about this movie.  Please do not listen to negative reviews of this movie.  Those who don't like this movie are not the true movie lovers.",1041120000,,982,4.705882352941177
1699899,5,B0000640VJ,"The cast of this movie should be a clue to you - not one person isn't a star in their own right.  Or consider the synopsis of the plot - a family of dsyfunctional geniuses reconcile after decades of failure.  Open the package of this DVD and you will immediately notice the love in which the film was made, right down to the personable scetches created by the director's brother.
Now imagine watching this movie and have all you're expectations met or exceeded.  That was my experience. This movie has become one of my all-time favorite films, something I've treasured and pondered long after I watched it.
Nothing at all is ordinary in this film.  The presense of Angelia Huston gave me the impression of a modern-day Addams Family, most everything bizarre and fascinating like that family was.  The exiled head of the family, Royal Tenenbaum, attempts to reconcile with everyone by pulling a [quick one] on them.  Richard Tenenbaum falls in love with his sister and lives in a tent in the middle of his room.  Clas Tenenbaum is a childhood business mogol who is obsessed with safety after his wife dies, and thus dresses himself and his children in identical, bright-red jumpsuits.
Each scene plays out like the characters - highly defined, quick witted and quick paced, backed with energy and emotion, and before you realized everything you saw, you're on to the next one.  The conflicts resolve in a satisfying yet never-predictable way - nothing you ever are hoping for happens, and yet everyone ends up happy.  The messages of redemption after failure are my favorite, and give this movie itself greatest weight.  To watch this family work through its incredible problems is a source of hope to even the most bitter person.",1041033600,,1729,4.8108108108108105

For me, it was like the back story you might envision for a painting, not specifically leading to a definitive ending; more like a sensation of a life and it's events. You may identify with a sense of the absurd, densely layered with character portraits that seem like caricatures, yet intensely familiar. It didn't coalesce as completely as Rushmore, but then I don't know that it was meant to. Individuals with absurdly dysfunctional family histories are probably guaranteed a connection with this film. The soundtrack is superb to boot.",1040083200,2,702,5.221238938053097
1699903,5,B0000640VJ,"You know, this film is basically an acquired taste.  If you like Adam Sandlers' sort of ha-ha films, this is not the film for you.  If you prefer clever dialogue, smart acting, and a more European or independent approach to comedy, you may like this film.  Look at it this way, Criterion is well-known for putting out solid DVDs on quality foreign films which may not always be to the general public's taste but have been shown over time to be influential or very good in their own right.  Well, Criterion released this Disney film on DVD, so that pretty much says it all.
The film is basically about a dysfunctional family, headed by the long-in-exile father Gene Hackman.  Now, he wants to work his way back into the family's good graces when he learns that his wife (they never divorced) wants to marry another man.  Sounds like the setting for a typical French comedy, so if you approach the film that way, you'll enjoy it just fine.  Like me.  Never saw it in the theaters, just bought it on a total whim, and enjoyed it very much.  The cast is great - I loved Paltrow's Tuesday Addams impression, and the Bjorn Borgish family member's tennis meltdown is waaay funny in a classy way.
One last word - I especially like the ""Peter Bradley"" interview on the extras DVD.  It looks and feels like a real and serious PBS-type interview with cast members, but the sheer incompetence of the questions and answers (nothing outrageous, just hilarious in context) is classic. At first, you think, GAWD this interviewer is AWFUL; then you realize...they're pulling an Orson Welles stunt. :) Great stuff. A 5-star DVD!",1039824000,4,1610,4.657243816254417
1699944,5,B0000640VJ,"If your sense of humor is not in the least bit on the dark side, don't even bother seeing this movie - you will hate it, and you will spend the next couple of days telling everyone how MUCH you hate it. Now, for the people who do have a dark sense of humor: this is a must-see. I went to see it in the theaters a couple of weeks after it came out, and I immediately wanted to see it again! I found the whole movie to be so royally entertaining that I just couldn't see why anyone would dislike it. It has a great ensemble cast that includes Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston, and BOTH of the Wilson brothers - and everyone is at their best. There was not one bad performance throughout the whole movie. It is true: this is a VERY quirky film, and some of the characters' actions sometimes seem to make no sense (the scene near the end with Owen Wilson and his painted face...well, I still don't understand that one - and Bill Murray's young sidekick--who was he, and why was he always around?), but it is as charming and tragic as it is quirky. The standout in the whole movie, in my opinion, would have to be Gwyneth Paltrow, as the family's ""adopted daughter"" Margot. With her dark eyelined eyes and almost constant frown she plays the part perfectly, and it really makes you like her as an actress. So anyway, if you have an appreciation for a kind of humor other than slap-stick, then you definitely should check this one out. Some say it's boring, but I say it's a fine film with a fine cast. The DVD is great, too - it's a double disc, which means there are tons of extra features - it's a treatment which films like this deserve.",1039651200,2,1689,4.297805642633229

This flick is such a shamblesome, interminable, wanky waste of time and talent... Whoever ordained director Wes Anderson as an auteur probably regrets it now: the most remarkable thing about him is his immense hubris in baldly recycling all the strained humor of the ""wacky"" counterculture comedies of the last four decades, and condensing it into one, horribly dull, overlong film. I mean, look, I really do ""get"" that the whole point of this style of humor lies in its excessiveness; but that doesn't mean that everything the director does is instantly going to be ""good""... and this trainwreck of a film is definitely NOT GOOD. Anderson's directorial philosophy seems to be make it funny -- no, wait: even funnier -- by constantly upping the ante... Every single detail of the film has to be odd, quirky, off-center, out there and bizarre. The technique is so mannered and predictable that it's incredibly boring. Couldn't he have worked on the plot, or the premise, or the acting, instead of his own insatiable uber-cleverness? Besides, wasn't this film a disaster before, when they made it as ""Hotel New Hampshire?""

1699947,2,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson clearly have watched Nashville if not the entire body of work of Robert Altman. Altman's films have a hit or miss quality. They are either marvelous, inventive and groundbreaking or hopeless messes full of arty pretense. Clearly the later group was an influence on Anderson and Wilson.
It's pretentious and precious all at the same time and, the worst part is, the makers of the film knowingly wink at his as if somehow we'll benefit by participating in this inside joke. Whatever merits Rushmore had (and it did have quite a few despite a stodgy structure and predictable, uninvolving central character)doesn't translate to this film.
The cast are all very good and it's clear why they took the roles--the characters are eccentric and rooted in their own corner of reality. That's the type of character that attracts Oscars and Academy attention come awards time. That's also the same problem with the film. It's a meandering mess full of predictable plot twists and outcomes.
The cinematography is one of the few stand outs in this boring mess. The selection of music also works to offset some of the tedium. This isn't a horrible film just a self important one. What's most disturbing is the way a lot of critics and audience members (usually those that feel they have to ""get"" the film otherwise they're not cool)were sucked into this large, empty canvas. These are the same type of folks that would have gone to see Deep Throat in the 70's and pointed out its virtues.
It's a pity as there are far more deserving films coming from indepedents that are virtually ignored. I'd recommend Rabbit Proof Fence instead of this meandering waste of time. By the way in calling it a waste of time, I mean that as a compliment.",1039478400,,1750,4.759868421052632

There are plenty of things in this film that will make you laugh.  Gene Hackman's ""shadow"", the little Indian man who accompanies him throughout the movie.  The witty, and sometimes awkward dialog between the many characters.  The elaborate lengths to which the characters go to spy on and deceive one another, and to catch one another in a deception.  The film is a masterpiece on so many levels.
There was a point in the film (without giving too much away) where Royal (Hackman) is speaking to one of his children (with whom he spends the film trying to build closer relationships).  The character looks at Royal, after experiencing a tremendously emotional event, and says, ""I've had a very bad year.""  Royal responds simply, but elequently.  ""I know.""  It's not placating.  It's not condescending.  It's a father telling his child, ""You've gotten though it, and you'll continue to get through it.  I have confidence in you.  Trust yourself.""  All of that is conveyed in the two word response, a powerful moment in the film, which Hackman pulls off with graceful panache.
If you have a couple of hours to watch this film in one sitting, by all means do so.  Watch it with your kids. Or your parents.  After reading the last bit of text in the film, don't be surprised to find yourself chuckling, even as you wipe a tear from your eye.",1038355200,6,1519,4.611940298507463

And, looking at all the 1 and 5 star reviews here, I see that this film does not disappoint.  As usual, though, I am shocked at the venomous reactions of those who did not take to the material.
Here's an idea - if you want to go to a movie, read a bit of a review anywhere.  If you had read even a teensy bit of a review for this film, you would have been warned in upper case, bold letters that Wes Anderson films are not your typical Hollywood fare.
If you are looking for a traditional Hollywood comedy, run very fast to Rush Hour 2 or Shallow Hal and leave the rest of us alone.  Wes Anderson films are the quintessential boundary crossers.  That's why real film buffs love them so much.  Its called complexity.  Say it with me now. Com - plex - i - ty.  Can you use it in a sentence?
Anderson uses his films to portray the bittersweet, poignant side of comedy.  Ask the best writers of comedy, and they will all tell you the same thing.  Comedy isn't pretty.  It's mean.  It's laughing at others' misfortunes.  There's nothing funny about letting Charlie Brown kick the football or letting him get the girl.  There would be nothing funny about Kevin Spacey's character in American Beauty if he just went about his business and did not melt down.
However, instead of typical comedy, which is usually just plain mean, Anderson infuses his characters with sadness, which seems to be what's upsetting everyone who wrote in.  Its kind of interesting looking at all the reviews. Mean comedy - good.  Sad comedy - bad.  Wish I knew why.
Let's start a petition so that next time around Wes has to put in a minimum of one acerbic, wise-cracking cop buddy, 5 explosions and a happy ending that involves people getting married and living happily ever after!  Woo hoo!",1038096000,11,1872,4.455882352941177

For me, there's a distinct progression from Bottle Rocket to Rushmore and then this, his latest, The Royal Tenenbaums--they're all excellent, but each is better than the last. The Tenenbaums is an extremely satisfying film on all fronts.  The acting, cinematography, story and dialogue excel.  And together create what all movies strive for, but rarely achieve in the collaborative work of filmmaking, a delightful amalgam of seamless synergy.  Even though I was ambivalent about it, Anderson's narrative device of framing the sections of the film as chapters in a book, gets additional points from me for expressing a willingness to take chances and experiment, a quality decidedly absent in so many of today's filmmakers.

Some specifics of what I enjoyed about the cinematography-use of lurid colors (house, clothes), shots (red cross over Richie ""Baumer"" Tenenbaum's hospital bed).  Thought quirky characters, family/friends, worked well in that my suspension of disbelief was never unduly challenged.

A dark comedy about a highly dysfunctional family led by bizarre patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) who'd abandoned them all two decades ago. Now he wants to return to his clinically detached former wife Etheline (Angelica Houston), but she is being courted by the family accountant (Danny Glover). A series of quirks of fate bring the kids back under their Mom's roof and the family - adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson) and Chas' two sons all find themselves together for the first time in nearly twenty years.

I assumed this would be an awesome and hilarious film, with actors such as Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Bill Murray but what i got was a boring, off beat movie with no direction.
Ben Stiller was plain, Owen Wilsons character didn't have any good lines, Ben Wilson can't Act, Bill Murray didn't get any punch lines, which is his strong point,  Danny Glover didn't have enough direction to express himself and  Gywneth Paltrow was..well...Gywneth Paltrow, very flat. Gene hackman was the only glimmer of hope this film has, and i mean the tiniest little glimmer you could imagine. No wonder it was only at the Aussie cinema's for a week.

But was I wrong! This movie is neither comedy or drama. It is not funny, save for some scant comically weird moments. I would say it is more depressing than anything else. Gwyneth Paltrow looks and acts like a zombie, the Owen Wilson character seemed to have no purpose at all in the film. And gee, that's a really exciting scene, to have druggy Wilson crash his car into a house and kill a little dog. Wow, what drama. Or was that supposed to be funny? What was the purpose of that scene I wonder? Or the purpose of most scenes in this movie.
The story tries to focus on the great patriarch, Gene Hackman, trying to make it up to his family. But the story really goes nowhere. There's too many silly little subplots that go nowhere, dialog that puts you to sleep, and scenes that make apparently no sense.

Witty production design, a fantastic musical score and a outstanding acting ensemble help to bring this story of the dysfunctional Tenenbaum family to life. Highly recommended for the movie alone, but the (as usual)excellent Criterion package, crammed with extras, makes this a must own for those who treasure humor of the literate kind.",1034985600,2,713,5.532110091743119
1700052,5,B0000640VJ,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"", directed by Wes Anderson, is a hilarious comedy about a dysfunctional family. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), has three kids who are all geniuses, and a wife. He leaves the family for several years, and finally decides to come back home to get his family back together. But now his kids are all grown up. Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) never got over the fact that his father was never there for him and even fired him from the job they both owned. Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) was a professional champion tennis player at a very young age until he quit unexpectedly. And Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) wrote her own plays and later when she grew up, seduced a bunch of men and married a much older man, named Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). The mother, Dr. Ethel Tenenbaum (Angelica Houston) is now an archaeologist and has fallen in love with another man, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). Royal comes back to his family claiming to have cancer and six weeks left to leave. They all feel guilty, so they let him stay. But when the family finds out that Royal was faking his illness, he has to prove to his family that he is worth their time and tries to win them back.
With an all-star cast and a superb script written by Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also costars in the film as Richie's best friend, Eli Cash), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is not to be missed. It's hilarious and witty. The criterion collection DVD is also a must, with special bonus features including interviews with the cast and filmmakers, outtakes, and more. The DVD comes in wide screen format. The film is also narrated by Alec Baldwin. One of the best films of last year.
I highly recommend ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".

I've seen it five times now, and I'm very eager to see it again.  The presentation is novel, and outstanding.  I really like how it's formed into ""chapters"" in a novel.  The main point I like, however, is this:  Here we see a family that fell apart (much like a lot of families I know).  Many years later, the person responsible for the animosity (the father Royal) tries to bring it back together.  He's brash, and insensitive, but he still pulls it off.  That's what I like most about the movie.  One of his final lines says it all.  His wife wants to remarry, and he says: ""I finally understand what you see in him.  He's everything I'm not.""  He's come to the realization that he's not the best thing since sliced bread, and he's OKAY with it!  You'd be hard pressed to find someone with this understanding in real life.

What reeled me in was the extreme subtlety of the film.  In the past two days I've watched it twice, after first seeing it in the theater when first releasesd, and still I discover new things in which to appreciate.  I really wish I could explain why I love this movie so much, but it's the intangible qualities, not necessarily the direction or story that does it for me.  Though the script is well-written and thorough, I suppose it's the subtle nuances of the performances and the interaction between the characters that I most enjoy.  If you watch closely, you find that the actors really try hard to completely inhabit their roles and give precisely the performance that draws you into the world of the Tenenbaums or maybe they just fooled me.
Either way, this was the last (I believe) movie that I voluntarily went to the theater to see and wasn't the least bit disppointed with.",1033948800,,1142,4.633663366336633
1700086,4,B0000640VJ,"After all, the title tells everything: it's about the Tenenbaums, one strange dysfunctional family with the perhaps best collection of oddball characters in recent years.  But unlike director Wes Anderson's previous work ""Rushmore,"" the new film lacks one thing: story.  So, be warned: this is not our usual laugh-out-loud comedy, but it certainly tickles your funny bones ... if you're in the mood.  If you're not ... , then you won't laugh in the next ten years.
And if you have seen some good American movies made since the 70s, or just happen to know the name of Gene Hackman, you soon realize that he is the best thing of the show, and actually he is.  Hackman charmingly plays the sire of the family, the most irreponsible father Royal Tenenbaum, who returns to his home after 22 years, now deprived of his license of a lawyer, and severely short of money, kicked out of the hotel he had been living in.
Now, the time has come for the reunion of the former members of the family, ex-genious children: Paltrow, Stiller, and Luke Wilson.  Surrounding the dying father (so he insists), they somehow start to heal the old wounds (including that of BB guns) received during the childhood ...
It is Hackman that you always are attracted to, inspite of his personality, and it is only natural, considering his talent.  But other actors are also good, particularly Paltrow with black eyelids, whose shady past full of secrets (and married to Bill Murrey!) is recounted in a short flashback with a Ramones song ""Judy is a Punk.""  This is the moment Wes Anderson is at  his best, showing witty, playful skills of his own.
But there are some flaws in the film, and one of them is that clearly the film is overcrowded with too many chracaters, and because of that, the story gets behind these portraits, getting thinner than that of ""Rushmore,"" which revolves around the hilarious, entangled relations between Jason Schuwartzman - Olivia Williams - Bill Murrey.  In the new film Bill Murrey's role doesn't mean much, and those of Owen and Luke Wilson just don't function well, compared with that of Hackman and Angelica Huston.  Some intrguing themes (like the near-incest relation between sister and brother) are taken up, and then left unsolved, and when we see these flaws, we remember the tight, original structure of ""Rushmore.""
After all, this is a unique version of unique family by one od the most unique directors in America.  There are lots of reference to the films in the past, as the signature of the post-Tarantino generations, but Anderson's film is consciously avoiding making it come to the forefront.  Instead, he presents his original view of the family with his meticulously designed photography.  This film may not suit everyone's taste as a comedy, but as a drama it still has universal appeal as long as how Royal Tenenbaum and his family act under this not-so-usual situations.",1033948800,,2895,4.836032388663968

I'd last seen Frank Christmas Eve night, about two weeks prior to seeing the movie. We''d torn apart the two by four lean-tos that had held the stock of trees, thrown the unsold wreaths over the fence that separated the handball court from out block-long stand, and headed to SoHo where we joined all the other employees of Manhattan's second-largest Christmas Tree chain in drinking fifty dollars each.

THese are the cars. One that is especially fond of these type of cars may want to look elsewhere if wanting to use their Amazon gift certificate! This movie is on the opposite end of say...Ace Ventura:Pet Detective.  It is subtle creativity.  Drama teachers may  like this type of humor, as well as movie buffs and those with a dry, witty sense of humor.  Immeadiately following the movie, I came to the conclusion that this movie seems more INTEResTING, even disturbingly captivating, than purely entertaining.  It seems the writers could, and wanted to make a darkly disturbing realistic mental film, maybe about drug abuse, childhood disasters, early- 30 midlife crisees, etc. but either didn't have the gusto or didn't want the label.  By making such a film as they did, though a bit lighter and more devoid such disturbances like character tormention  and inner anguish(breaking the rules of a comedy but not smashing them to bits), they attempted to ""mainstream"" it and make it more accesible, a little less heavy and more trivial.  With the all-star cast and big publicity, easier to swallow seems to be the safe route to go.  Speaking of breaking the rules, since this movie is kind of a drama/morose comedy, it breaks many rules of comedy: namely don't put graphic suicide attempts or incest in the movie, so beware, these parts are after the first half hour so put the kids to bed. I have some friends that bought it and did NOT like it, though as the title of these comments implies, this film is not easily accessible nor fit for mainstream view. This is good, since I love to see a film that is both creatively written and directed from a non-norm perspective, provided it doesnt detract from the script, actor talent, etc.  On the flip side, the 20 year old stocker friend of mine at the local blockbuster liked it enough to buy it, saying the replay value and things u notice in the background were worth the price.  Just as Pulp Fiction got mixed reviews, so will this. Bottom line: IF your open to exploring new sub-genres and/or like subtle irony to make u chuckle, give it a try.

1700141,5,B0000640VJ,"***The Rise and Fall of the Royal Tenenbaums*** (and the rise again).
Another masterpiece of humor by Wes Anderson who brought us ""Rushmore"".  This time the film was co-written with Owen Wilson.
A dandy home on the corner of a NYC residential block is where Royal Tenenbaum resides. He, the patriarch of the family and his wife Ethel, (Anjelica Huston) live each on separate floors of the home.  All of Tenebaum's children are gifted...so much so that the mother, Ethel writes a novel of her life with the young prodigies.
Why so smart? Is it the isolation between the children or their parents? Or are they just plain gifted?
Chas Tenenbaum, (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard...buying real estate from the age of 12.
Margot Tenenbaum, (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a prize winning playwright as a young girl.
Finally, we have Richie, (Luke Wilson) a child prodigy of tennis.
These are the Tenenbaum children.  We see them in their habitats. We watch them as if they are goldfish swimming in individual tanks.  Each child has an extreme personality and each child is utterly independent from the family as a whole.
One day the family dynamics change forever. Royal, (Gene Hackman) decides he must leave.  For the next twenty years or so life progresses without a father.  The children grow up..each becoming a dehydrated model of what they once were.
But each Tenenbaum child also becomes ordinary...
Margot marries a man who knows nothing of her (played by Bill Murray).  He doesn't even know she smokes.  Her days of writing plays over.
Chas, the financial wizard grows into a red, jumpsuit-wearing father of two, who lost his wife in an accident.  He is also a paranoid safety phobic.
Richie lost the tennis match of his life and hides behind long hair and a beard as an adult.
Each Tenenbaum kid seems to have a few OCD's.
Fun begins when Royal Tenebaum is broke, living away from home so long that he pioneers a plot to win back his family's affections. He pretends to have cancer.  They don't believe him, nor do they care...but Royal moves back in the home with bad timing. His wife wants to remarry...she has fallen in love with Henry Sherman, (Danny Glover) who was her former accountant.  One by one the Tenenbaum children migrate back to the home they grew up in.
The entire story is narrated by Alec Baldwin.
Each character is so detailed and developed it's kind of creepy.  The movie oozes bottom-of-the-barrel-humor.  A dry comedy with fabulous imagination.
Some scenes make me laugh and others become quite serious and I laugh too.  I ask myself ""Am I sick for finding this funny?""
I think that is the point.
The movie is strange enough to annoy some movie-goers, but grab the rare few who decide not to HAVE to ""get it"".
It's like watching ""Vanilla Sky""... a great movie, but relax and enjoy..don't ponder too much, or you miss the finer elements.
I enjoyed the Royal Tenenbaums with all their dysfunctional weirdness and quirks...and I must say this may be the performance of a lifetime for Gene Hackman.",1032220800,6,3014,4.74904214559387
1700142,1,B0000640VJ,"Every now and again a film comes along that is self-effacingly quirky, sharply insightful without being TOO corny and rabidly addictive without being overbearingly simplistic. Then, on the other hand, there are films which attempt to be all of the above, and fail appalingly.
Sadly, The Royal Tenembaums falls firmly into the latter category.
Let's be straight from the start. This film is shockingly awful. If only this film was as clever and witty as it thinks it is, it would be the best thing ever to have graced the widescreen. Sadly, it's so far up its own backside - with its all-star cast adding to the artistic pretension - that it fails to entertain, let alone engage the viewer on even the most rudimentary of levels.
It's easy to imagine a merry middle-class crowd sitting around a dinner party table discussing the ""hilarious"" moments from this movie, but the comedic moments are about as hard-hitting as a left hook from Pee Wee Herman. The dialogue is cringe-inducingly forced, the characters do little to inspire viewer empathy and the direction - while probably way over my head - is pathetically contrived.
I'm sure the stars of this movie can sleep better at night knowing they've been in an ""artistically serious"" film, but at the end of the day this piece of work assaults the senses like a sickening wave of nausea.
If you're looking for a comedy and you choose this movie, be warned - just make sure you laugh at all the points you so obviously expected to laugh. There's nothing fresh, inventive or spontaneous about this film. Instead, it's just re-hashed nonsense that makes a feeble attempt to satisfy the sycophantic media morons that lap up this kind of nonsense like dehydrated kittens.

The characters just don't add up to much beyond some superficial tics; Ben Stiller and Danny Glover especially are wasted in dull roles. Royal's fake illness was a promising start to the story, but it fizzles after that. The Gwyneth Paltrow/Luke Wilson love affair subplot seemed like a particularly self-conscious attempt to generate some plot momentum, but it too is unconvincing and goes nowhere. Wes Anderson seems way too impressed with his own abilities throughout the movie, giving us some nice-looking shots along with a lot of overdesigned, tricked-out ones that scream with pretension. Most annoying of all is the music. Where the music in Rushmore was used deftly to underscore moods and heighten emotion, The Royal Tenenbaums just beats you over the head with it. Anderson seems intent on cramming his favorite songs into every available minute, regardless of whatever's actually happening in each scene. It was like trying to watch a movie with a radio on in the same room. In short, a big letdown.",1031270400,9,1184,5.045918367346939

I never dreamt in my wildest flight of fancy that I could laugh at puns about death, suicide, and infidelity.  And though the Tenenbaums are Royal they definitely aren't flush with the usual cliches of this particular genre.  I would see it again, for certainly it was full of ambiguities.  But if you're a woman it would definitely be more enjoyable if you can get your date to pay for the rental.  I've rented several movies and at least they give you lots to talk about after it's over.

The ""point"" of the movie is not going to be spoon-fed to you, and this makes it very rewatchable, because each time there are more nuances to be found, more music to be listened for. The scenery and costumes are beautifully stylized, and the use of book covers and illustrations reminiscent of the 60s and 70s is a brilliant touch.

What starts as a pitch black comedy about a family of neurotic, failed child prodigies (Stiller, Paltrow and Luke Wilson) poisoned by the self-indulgence of their dissolute-but-still-loveable patriarch (Hackman) morphs effortlessly somewhere in the final reel into a touching paen to forgiveness, redemption and family without losing its offbeat edge at all.
Anderson's bold use of well-composed head-on shots is dazzling at times.  His and Owen Wilson's screenplay is as sharp and snappy as they get, creating a ensemble of quirky, memorable characters that give all of the actors something to sink their teeth into.  All of the performances from the leads to the elevator attendants are top notch (especially Hackman and Luke Wilson, the latter's performance being something of a revelation), and the soundtrack makes a perfect counterpoint to what's going on onscreen.
The DVD is a Criterion, so (as you've come to expect) it's excellent in quality with loads and loads of nifty features.

So I didn't really get the sense that he was the reason his kids turned out to be such failures. Overall I would simply have to say that as a comedy it failed, ditto in the drama department, and I barely made it through the entire thing.

Wes Anderson's gift lies in his characters, and he introduces quite a few uniques ones in this movie. At the center of the movie is the hilariously disfunctional family, the Tenebaums. The father, Royal (Gene Hackman), after years of estrangement from both his wife and children, tries to get back into their lives. The history of the family is, as you will find out, is as checkered as their present. Ben Stiller plays the former child prodigy of the business world who, after losing his wife, devotes his to insanely watching over his two children. Gwenyth Paltrow plays a depressed, washed-up, chain-smoking playwrite who hasn't produced anything for years. Luke Wilson plays a former tennis pro who give up the game to wander the world in limbo, carrying some emotional scars with him (you'll find out when watch the movie). Royal now wants to set things right with his family, but meets some resistence, obviously he wasn't the best father and husband. Anjelica Houston, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover have terrific supporting roles.
Wes Anderson's trademark of cut scenes, flashbacks, and outrageous theatrics all blend to make ""The Royal Tenebaums"" a wholly pleasing experience. It is depressing at times, though, and more serious than Anderson's earlier films. Still, it is dark comedy at it's best.
The DVD edition contains loads of extras, spanning 2 DVDs. The usual documentaries and trailer aside, the video quality is superb. It makes you understand why the name ""Criterion Collection"" is synonymous with top quality in DVDs.",1030406400,5,1807,5.108108108108108

The kids grow up into a financial wizard (Ben Stiller, ""Meet the Parents"") a tennis pro (Luke Wilson, ""My Dog Skip"") and a playwright (Gwynneth Paltrow, ""Shakespeare in Love""). All are successful, all are miserable.
Until, that is, Royal decides he wants his family together again, and that the only way to do that is to pretend to be suffering from a terminal disease.
Dark and moody, this film is nevertheless brilliantly written and executed with a great cast that also includes Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"") and Bill Murray (""Ghostbusters""). The only downside for me was the inclusion of co-writer Owen Wilson (""Shanghai Noon"") as the neighbor/would-be-Tenenbaum Eli Cash. I'm sorry, I just can't stand the guy as an actor. He always comes across as wooden and not funny and he looks like he's got a broken nose. But he's a pretty spiffy writer, so points for that.

I think my favorite aspect of the two Wes Anderson films I've seen (this and Rushmore but alas have not yet seen Bottle Rocket) is the use of music.  A great combination of imagery and music perfectly captures, to me at least, EXACTLY what the character is feeling.  I haven't seen music used this effectively in years - ok maybe Moulin Rouge but I really wasn't watching it that closely.  It seems to me that lately music editors (or whomever is in charge of choosing music for films) either goes right for the emotional jugular (ok let's play some sad music here so the audience will cry...ok let's play some fun poppy music here so people will enjoy the beauty makeover montage, etc) or randomly chooses something easy to sell for the soundtrack.  I don't get that feeling with Anderson's films at all.  It's more like we get to listen to the soundtrack playing in the character's head.  And as far as I'm concerned the characters in this film have excellent taste in music.
Maybe it's just one of those things..you love this movie or you hate it.  I happen to love it.  Happily watched it four times during my 5 day rental period and look forward to owning it soon.

No, it isn't because we're brain dead people with no attention span, The Royal Tennenbaums is just a bad unentertaining movie from start to finish.  I remember slumping in my seat after 45 minutes realizing this dreck was as good as it was going to get.  I bought into the hype by film critics who should know better.
This black comedy about a dysfunctional family misses in every way.  Sure the casting is offbeat, but so what if Ben Stiller wears a 70's track suit, or Gwnyeth Paltrow smokes cigarettes on the sly and looks unattractive, is that it?  Where does that go?  I cared nothing for any of the characters, the Luke Wilson character was just morbid.  Ha ha he's a fallen tennis pro, ha ha, Owen Wilson crashes his car, what was the point of it all?  Gene Hackman tries his best, but despite his good reviews, he is wasted here.  I saw nothing original here, nothing that inspired me, it's a sad commentary on today's movie that people who should know better love just anything that seems offbeat.

Though far from a masterpiece, it's a highly entertaining film, though its' attempts at being quirky for quirky's sake threaten to undermine the picture on more than one occasion.  The highly  dysfunctional Tennenbaum clan is the crux of the story, with backstory on the characters and other parts of the film  narrated deftly by Alec Baldwin. As the estranged patriarch, Gene Hackman deserved at least an Oscar nod, giving one of  the best lead performances of last year. Ably supporting him  are Anjelica Huston as the brilliant yet emotionally  clueless family matriarch, Gwyneth Paltrow, showing deadpan brilliance as adopted daughter Margot, and Danny Glover as Huston's coworker and suitor.  Fairing less well are the remaining male cast, particurly Ben Stiller(doing his  umpteenth take on ""the weirdest one in the crowd"")and Luke Wilson, who continues to mistake his brand of laid-back  acting as some tiny ray of talent(sorry, but I have yet to  see it).

1700283,3,B0000640VJ,"I couldn't stop watching.  The movie was advertised as a comedy, and on that front I was rather disappointed.  It wasn't very funny.  Some have said it was a drama, which is probably the closest one could come to categorizing it, though that is far from an exact fit.  The longer, more accurate, description would be slightly funny, slightly dramatic American 'art film'.
While I am far from in love with this film, there is a certain appeal to it that made watching enjoyable enough.  It takes place in a sort of fantasy New York, being defined by no strict geography or time period.  For that, it was a visually interesting movie. I loved the old fashioned elevator operators and their uniforms.
Perhaps, if there is anything to relate to, it is the nutty, strange, and yet common craziness that tends to pervade families. Most of us tend to keep up a ""normal"" appearance and hold everything else behind closed doors.  The Tenenbaums at least do it out in the open, unashamedly, and with a certain unique flair. For that, the movie is worth watching.",1029196800,2,1052,4.654054054054054
1700284,4,B0000640VJ,"The trailers for ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" offered glimpses of a film I knew would be different than the usual tripe one gets from a Hollywood comedy these days.  Don't get me wrong, films like ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the Farrelly brothers have their place and are a necessary evil in the world of comedies to maintain balance.  But the 5000 [others] that followed suit have tilted the American comedy towards a less and less appealing mediocrity.
So when a film like this comes along that dares and strives to be different in a humorous sense, the balance is restored, and Wes Anderson champions again the dry and sly wit that makes one perpetually chuckle instead of occasionally laugh.  As he did in ""Rushmore"", Anderson has elevated dead-pan comedy to another level.  Much like the Coen brothers did for ""Barton Fink"" and ""Fargo"", Wes Anderson points out the absurdities of reality, and lets these subtle idiosynchrasies speak for themselves.  It's Zen-comedy that tries by not trying.  And it works.
Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow play parts that seem as if written for them (and an excellent vehicle for Gwyneth to show her hidden talents as an actress).  The neurotic Ben Stiller and remedial Danny Glover seem a bit our of place in a film that moves like an Austrian cuckoo clock between scenes, but Gene Hackman does an excellent job portraying the asinine father that binds the family together against their will.
So if you're looking for humor dumbed-down for easy accessibility, you're coming to the wrong film.  But if you enjoy comedic style perfected by the British in the sixties and revamped and modernized by the Coens and Wes Anderson in the 21st century, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a must-have for those who like to chuckle for two hours straight.",1029110400,4,1761,4.846666666666667
1700285,5,B0000640VJ,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is easily the most accessible of director Wes Anderson's three movies.  Like its brothers, it scales the daunting task of pairing quirkiness with sincerity.  It is a truly ensemble work; every character brings a different meaning to the whole.  Because of this, it may seem at times that Anderson has overextended himself.  However, the film never bites off more than it can chew.  Like Anderson's subtle coming-of-age ""Rushmore,"" it is a study in the process of personal revelation and redemption.  It's different from other movies with similar motives, though -- it's fun to watch.
The 2-disc DVD set is nifty.  The art (which is the only reason I'd ever even think of scrapping my plain-jane ""Rushmore"" DVD for the Criterion Edition) is unbelievably sad and funny and labored, which is a good thing.  The interviews are pretty boring, and like some of the other DVD Extras, awfully self-indulgent.  But some nerd will like the Extras, and simply for the sake of thoroughness, they're a plus to the DVD and not a minus.  Pleasantly, this movie got a direct-to-Criterion release, and for good reason.  It's just a really great movie.  It's compassionate, smart, a little snarky, quirky, detailed (right down to the typefaces on every book), nuanced, and above all, genuine.  It is a comedy that holds back just enough to ring true.",1029110400,3,1355,4.9688888888888885

I went to see the movie with two of my best friends, in a packed theater opening week and noticed right away something was wrong. We were the only ones laughing.

You know when you are cruising down the aisle at the video store and you pick up that film you've never heard of and it turns out to be one of your faves?  That's what this was like.  As Wes Anderson puts it on the commentary track, many ""rules"" of film making are broken.  Odd camera angles, starting the story after about 10 long minutes of intro, narration, etc...  This is a far cry from your average big screen, big budget production.

1700367,3,B0000640VJ,"""The Royal Tennenbaums"" is not a comedy that will appeal to everybody. The titular family, ruled by Gene Hackman (Royal Tennenbaum) and Anjelica Huston, was split between the conflicting forces of their prodigal children, but mostly due to Royal's relentless opportunism. Chas (Stiller) was a brilliant businessman by the age of nine - looking and living the part (his bedroom looks more like an office than somebody's bedroom, complete with linoleum). Richie (Luke Wilson, though unrecognizable behind beard and glasses for much of the film) was a tennis champ who turned pro by 17. Margot (Paltrow), Royal's adopted daughter, was an award-winning playwright by 11. By the start of the flick, they're all grown-up and damaged in some way or another - Richie's secret love for Margot has destroyed his tennis career, while Margot is all but clinically depressed and creatively blocked. The death of Chas's wife in a private airplane crash has turned him compulsively safe. Royal, disbarred and briefly imprisoned (we learn that Chas had Royal disbarred, and his half of the house expropriated) is out of cash, and is forced to return to the little house on Orchard Street.  Royal manages to worm his way back claiming he's dying of stomach cancer, and the family only reluctantly takes him back. Though Chas loudly opposes the family's having anything to do with Royal, only Danny Glover, as a romantic contender for Mrs. Tennenbaum, is able to see through Royal's schemes.
If you've seen ""Rushmore"", then you'll find Wes Anderson's direction here strikingly. (meandering plot lines, understated characters and a script that is light handed to the point of being non-existent) Of course the cinematography is the clearest link between the two - with many scenes being less scenes than simply snapshots in which there is movement. (I think Anderson's point is that his characters are people whose achievements have eclipsed their identities, so much that they're lives easily boil down to the quick bios found behind their books, but that's just my blathering take on it all).  Not a lot really makes sense in this film - Royal first returns home because he's out on the street, but he tries to worm his way into their lives as well, only increasing the chances that they'll be fed up enough to see through his lies.  Richie is destroyed by Margot's marriage to a professional melancholic played by Bill Murray, but we soon learn that she was famously unfaithful, almost following a compulsive infidelity already - so why did she marry? Chas hates Royal for many reasons, though we're not sure which has cemented their bad blood (a BB, permanently lodged in Chas's hand when he was shot by Royal, doesn't quite explain things; Chas is more affected by his wife's death, though that's got nothing to do with Royal). Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), who grew up across the street from the Tennenbaums, is a bigger mystery - it seems that he harbored a love of Margot himself, but that was a mystery to her even by the time he's foresworn her.  Though inwardly envious of the Tennenbaum's for the sake of being simply a Tennenbaum which is weird enough, Cash has no connection in the film to Royal, who has made the family everything it is.  Hopelessly hooked on Mescaline (climaxing in a tragic act of recklessness at the movie's end), Eli's place in the film, so unconnected with its other characters, is hard to explain. He gives the film some much needed energy, but little else.
The biggest mistake is how the script tries to create a multitude of characters patterned after Max from ""Rushmore"" (Max loves attending the elite prep school, Rushmore, even though he's a hopeless academic failure; He lives just to be near his cozy school, much as the characters here long to return to the family home, but little more than that. ""Rushmore"" worked because Max's quirks seemed so out of place and wonderfully highlighted against the rest of the world in that film. Here, everybody is as nutty and directionless as Max. For that reason, I can't really recommend this flick unless you've already seen and loved ""Rushmore"". Otherwise, you'll be staring numb at your tube for 110 minutes wondering why you're not laughing.",1028505600,2,4206,4.909985935302391

1700370,5,B0000640VJ,"I think that The Royal Tenenbaums is probably the most original, intelligent, and clever this year.  The film starts by developing its characters and setting the scene.  This is important because the scene that it sets is not exactly real. In every scenario, something is not quite right.  The New York you see is not the real New York, and the characters are odd, quirky, and have very interesting makeups.  The humor in this movie is not like something you would find in Zoolander or Billy Madison, it is a more intelligent brand of comedy  .The movie twists and turns through highs and lows of each character.

The beauty of these Wes Anderson DVD's starts with the charm of the handmade drawings, as in the Royal Tenenbaum's map of the house. Even the packaging, is designed to look like a book. Very artsy. But after viewing the whole movie, I can honestly say that I thought the best parts of the film were the trailers shown on TV. The description of the movie is thoroughly entertaining, but for me, the whole movie was just a bit too slow. There were humorous moments, such as the twin grandsons playing with Royal, but then there was also a bleakness which I didn't enjoy.

Anderson wrote this screenplay with he usual screenwriting partner, Owen Wilson (who played Eli, the Tennenbaums across-the-street neighbor).  The screenplay is filled with many wonderful and marvelous moments, and while one might complain that the whole is less than the summation of the parts, the parts are nonetheless very exquisite.  The film is stuffed with marvelous moments that are almost throwaways, like a scene in which Chas (Ben Stiller) and his father Royal (Gene Hackman) escape to a closet to argue.  The closet is filled with every board game one can possibly imagine, which provides a startling contrast by implying that there was a time when the family perhaps sat around together playing these precise games.  Or when one of the characters attempts suicide and then leaves the hospital, a haunting, gorgeous song by Nick Drake, ""Fly"" is played.  The song is a marvelous paean to second chances, and many of the lyrics seem to refer to specific moments in the film.  But what is more poignant is the fact that Drake is one of rock's most celebrated suicides, albeit primarily to his cult following.  Another detail is the fact that every cab that is seen in the entire film are ""Gypsy Cabs"" and are the most dilapidated, battered cabs one can imagine.
The soundtrack is exquisite, and one that even those not enjoying the movie would be tempted to buy.  The selections are marvelous, whether it is Ravel's String Quartet, or the Ramones, or the Clash, or Lou Reed, or the Stones.  One word of complaint, however.  As a Stones fan and as one who owned vinyl versions of most of their albums, and the two Stones songs that Luke Wilson and Gwenyth Paltrow listen to in his tent are not the songs that are on the actual vinyl album.  ""Ruby Tuesday,"" for instance, is not the second cut but the third, and the song that appears first is actually a couple of cuts after ""Ruby Tuesday.""
The cast is absolutely first rate, though many of the actors are playing roles that are somewhat at odds with what we normally expect of them.  This is especially true of the three Tennenbaum children.
So, while I expect that many people seeing this will dislike it, many others will enjoy it thoroughly.  If you liked BOTTLE ROCKET or RUSHMORE, odds are you will like this one as well.",1027814400,49,2799,4.716632443531828

1700400,4,B0000640VJ,"I knew nothing about this movie before seeing it...just the few trailers I had seen on television.
I was delightfully surprised. This movie entertained, had a great cast with good lines, a good sound track, and provided a bit of food for thought. It was not a straight comedy, and there were some sad situations within this strange and dysfunctional family. This viewer felt a whole range of emotions while watching the film.
It was a different kind of comedy, one without huge belly laughs -- more subtle and quirky than the run-of-the-mill comedy. While sometimes a bit awkward, I thought this reflected how the neurotic members of this family actually were--not really comfortable with each other but loving in their own unique way.
Glad I saw it.",1027728000,3,750,4.8671875
1700401,5,B0000640VJ,"This is one of those movies where you're either going to love it or hate it.  I think that most of the people who hated this film was expecting it to be a full-blown comedy.  Well...it's not.  Although, I must confess, I laughed harder and more during this film than most of the comedy blunders that have come out this year or last year.  So, if this does not sound like your type of movie, then stop reading the review and rent something like ""Shallow Hal,"" ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""Saving Silverman,"" ""Scary Movie,"" ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" or ""Not Another Teen Movie.""  Not knocking those movies, just suggesting that those might be the type of movies your looking for.  There is nothing wrong with people not liking this film.  It is a unique one, at that.
With that said, I think that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a magnificent and brilliant picture.  A very rare breed of film, it is.  I feel it's very underrated, but then again that's because it's not a movie for everyone.  Very much like ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Vanilla Sky,"" this is a movie that will only appeal to a certain amount of people.  However, I feel that this is a great movie that plays on all of your emotions.
The movie is quite simple; or at least the main storyline.  I will only give you a brief outline of it, because I do not want to give anything away.  A lot of the humor is so subtle and surprising, that if you know about it ahead of time, you will not find it as funny as you would've having not knowing what was coming.  The Tenenbaums is a family of geniuses; only problem is that they're dysfunctional as hell.  Mainly thanks to the father, Royal Tenenbaum, who has been out of the family picture for quite some time.  Over twenty years later, Royal decides it's time to be a part of the family again, being that his wife is thinking about marrying again.  So, knowing that his wife will not let him see them again unless something was seriously wrong, Royal pretends to be dying.  The results are unpredictable and outrageous.  And yet, very subtle.
This film has the best cast that I have seen in a long time.  Look at it: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and Luke and Owen Wilson.  Gene Hackman should've won something for his performance, because he steals the show.  He is so funny and sarcastic in this film.  Bill Murray is also hillarious, and dosen't get the recognition he deserves.  Owen Wilson is great as Elie Cash, who was the kid across the street who always wanted to be a Tenenbaum.  And you don't even recognize Luke Wilson until later on in the film.  But really, everyone is great.
The movie is directed by Wes Anderson, who did ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore.""  Although I enjoyed those two films, I enjoyed this one much more.  It's also written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  Let me tell you, the screenplay in this movie is AMAZING.  Very convincing and witty.
This isn't really a comedy.  It's a comedy-tragedy.  There are times where it's funny, sad, touching, dark, and sarcastic.  Again, I think that's where people got the wrong idea.  Well, at least now you know, and you can't say nobody told you so.  I just love how subtle the comedy is.  You won't find crude or toilet humor in this movie, so be warned.  Oh, and don't expect another ""Rushmore,"" please.  I cannot tell you how many reviews I read that complained that this wasn't like ""Rushmore.""  Expand your horizons, people!  You want ""Rushmore,"" this is what you do:  Watch ""Rushmore,"" and watch this when you're in the mood to see ""The Royal Tenenbuams.""
What I love most is, belive it or not, this might be the first movie that I won't have to re-buy on DVD.  OH MY GOD!  That is a first.  Finally, they did it right.  They came out with a version of the movie that is ALREADY full of extras.  Cool!  Thought that was unheard of!  Wow.  Mind-blowing, man!  Well, the extras are awesome.  There's so much.  Interviews, commentary, drawings, trailers, and much MUCH more.
Technical features also top-notch.  The picture is great.  Sound is great, giving you a choice between Dolby Digital and DTS.  Outstanding sound.  Brings the music to life.
All in all, this movie is fantastic.  It has a great script, great cast of characters, great story, and just overall, it is a great movie.  Again, this isn't a movie for everyone.  I hope this review has helped some.  But really, give it a chance.  What's the worst that can happen?  You don't like it, then rent something else next time.  It really is a great movie and is one of my new favorites.  ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a unique and clever film that, I hope, is destined to become a classic.",1027728000,5,4665,4.524609843937575
1700402,1,B0000640VJ,"I sat there for 90 minutes trying to find something redeeming in this story and something to care about in the characters.  I sat there with my 2 beagles on my lap and thrilled in finding a beagle (Buckley) in a featured role.  When he is then struck down and senselessly run over and killed by the drug addict character of Eli Cash, the death is treated with the same cold indifference with which the characters treat each other.  I wish PETA or other dog lovers would speak out about another horrible exploitation of animals (remember the poor dog in the cast in ""There's something about Mary"", or the electrocuted cat in ""Christmas Vacation""?).  This just further serves to promote animals as cheap disposable commodities, undeserving of the respect they require as loving, loyal sentient beings.
I'm glad I only rented this and did not buy it.  I only wish I had turned it off after the first hour as I was tempted to, because even without this awful scene, and despite the stellar cast, this is a perfectly awful movie.",1027728000,3,1024,4.6353591160221

The careful planning of every detail and character trait is what truly makes this a great film.  It has a style all its own and is a true original.
There are quite a few extras on the second disc of this DVD package, including actor interviews a documentary, and plenty of photos.  I only wish the documentary, directed by Albert Maysles, could have been a little longer and more in depth.

1700461,3,B0000640VJ,"After seeing this film, it is apparent why Wilson and Anderson were nominated for an Academy Award for best original screenplay.  This movie is like no other that I have seen.  I usually do not like narrated films, but luckily, there was not enough to ruin this movie.  The characters are developed nicely from youth to adult age.  We are allowed a look at the past to see why they are the way they are in the present.  The name of the movie comes from the Character of Gene Hackman, who plays Royal Tenebaums.  Once a pone a time, being a Tenenbaum really meant something, but after two decades of misfortune, they have all but been forgotten for their brilliance.  The body of this movie takes place in the present when all the children are not only grown up, but messed up in the head as well.  When Mrs. Tenebaum is proposed to, Royal seeks to reunite with his family in hopes to break up his wife and her new found love and win her back.  After pretending to be dying, Royal moves back in with his wife (all the children due to their own special circumstances, have also moved back home.)  Once the family finds out that Royal is not dying, he is kicked out on the streets.  Royal realizes that the past six days he has spent with his family have been the best of his life.  Outstanding performances by the entire cast which includes Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray.

1700463,5,B0000640VJ,"The following review will only discuss the features on ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" Special Edition DVD put out by Criterion.
------------
After the stunning success of the Criterion DVD for ""Rushmore"", Wes Anderson has gone back to that same company to produce a special edition of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".  It does not disappoint.
Disc one contains a stunning widescreen transfer of the movie, and a commentary track.  Wes does the honours alone this time, and his track is loaded with juicy tidbits.  He's got this fragile little voice, barely above a whisper, but he speaks with such authority about the kind of film he was trying to make.  Everything seems to be under his control, from the set designs (about which he can't help go on and on, to the point where he remarks that his comments are probably getting quite tedious; uh, they aren't), to the music, to the camera shots, to the colour, etc., etc., etc.  But on the other hand, there are several moments where he just can't explain why a line of dialogue or a visual is included, but he knew intuitively that it would work.  Invariably, it does.  The ""Coltrane"" comment is a great example of this, as is the colour of Chas' workout suit (one of the best anecdotes has Wes admitting that the reason he gave Ben Stiller for the colour of the suits was made up on the spot, having never come up with a real reason of his own; he just knew that that was what he wanted).  He's also quite unapologetic about stealing moments from movies that influenced him.  References to Cocteau, Bunuel, and Truffaut abound; he points out that the opening is lifted directly from Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons""; and he provides the much sought after reference explaining the mysterious line Luke Wilson speaks into the mirror.  Wes is a director who wears his influences proudly on his sleeve, but is still able to mix them up in a way that seems fresh and original.
On Disc two we get a whole load of supplementals.  ""With the Filmmaker"" is a 25-minute documentary, I believe for the Independent Film Channel, that follows Wes around during preproduction of the movie.  It's great to see his inventiveness and his attention to detail shown full-force.  Wes, as a screen persona, reminds me a lot of R. Crumb, if Crumb were 20 years younger, had less of a drawl, and a more stable family.  Wes comes across as an unabashed geek in this feature, but a geek who knows what he wants to do with the power he's been given.  It's a real treat.
""The Peter Bradley Show"" is a bizarre mock talk show segment, hosted by an actor (whose name is mentionned at some point, but escapes me now) as Bradley, a Charlie Rose-esque interviewer.  He's a befuddled and confused man, who appears to believe that the men he's interviewing are real actors, when in fact they are merely Anderson's non-actor friends, each of whom have bit parts in his movies.  Most interesting revelations: the film's namesake, Brian Tenenbaum, works selling steel over the phone, and Sanjay Mathew's (a childhood friend of Wes' who plays Richie Tenenbaum's tennis opponent) favourite drug to prescribe to his psychiatric patients is Remeron.  I can't figure out where this segment came from, but I'm pretty sure it's not meant to be taken seriously.  Or is it?  Must be seen to be believed.
The disc features a number of graphical sections, owing their inclusion to Wes' passion for background ephemera.  You get: a slide show of photos taken from the set; the covers of all the fake books that appeared in the movie; all of Richie Tenenbaum's portraits of his sister (complete with a bibliography of the plays she is shown reading in those pictures: Ionesco, Brecht, Beckett, etc.); details of Richie's wall murals; details of the paintings of Miguel Calderon that inspired Eli Cash's madness, etc.  All included in toto for your perusal.  For those of you (us) who love to get lost in the backgrounds of Wes' films, here's another opportunity to indulge your passions.
Also included are some quick, candid moments from the set (including Angelica Huston's hair catching fire, and Kumar Palana's plate spinning act).
In a movie so full of on-disc extras and goodies, I'm shocked to report that the set's greatest treasures can be found in its liner notes.  Two separate foldouts come in the case.  The first is an epic collection of Eric Chas Anderson's (Wes' brother) drawings, detailing the floor plans and interior designs of the Tenenbaum's home.  Eric's drawing style is delightfully juvenile, innocent and colourful and vivacious.  It's good to know that Wes isn't the only one in the Anderson clan obsessed by detail.  Mies van der Rohe would be most proud.  The second foldout has a wonderful, lengthy essay on Anderson's oeuvre by Kent Jones.  Jones, a contributing editor of 'Film Comment' and a contributor to 'Cahiers du Cinema' and 'The Village Voice', dissects ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"", and ""Tenenbaums"" with the skill of a surgeon and the unabashed passion of Casanova.
I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" when it played in theatres, and am looking forward to years of enjoyment, repeatedly playing this wonderful DVD collection.",1027296000,10,5159,4.842824601366742
1700464,1,B0000640VJ,"This is one of those rare movies that is so full of talent I honestly don't think the producers knew how to handle it.  Just look at it... It's a cast of ""who's hot in Hollywood.""  But for me, as much as I tried to watch this movie and find the humor in it, it just missed.
Look at the cover.  That's about as funny as it gets.  I hate to sound so negative, but if you're a Hackman fan, this isn't his best... if you want to see Ben Stiller being funny, rent ""Meet the Parents.""  If you want to see Owen Wilson being funny, rent ""Shanghai Noon.""  If you want to see Bill Murray being funny, rent ""Kingpin.""  In this movie, this wonderful cast just never clicks.
My advice would be to watch it when it comes out on regular cable...  Trust me... you can wait!
Sorry!  Only one star!",1027209600,4,780,4.078947368421052
1700495,5,B0000640VJ,"From the very first shot of The Royal Tennenbaums, I was engaged. I am not a typical movie-goer. I tend to see movies long after they have been released, I see movies that seem interesting or that I hear a buzz about. And I see the same movies over and over. I have a short attention span, and low tolerance for unimaginative movies. The actors featured in the picture caught my interest, and I bought the DVD without having seen the rental first. I was completely engrossed in this movie, something that has not happened since Private Ryan (but for a different reason). You can read the plot summary from other places, I'll tell why I thought so highly of it.
First when I go away from a movie and I actually have a conscious thought, question, or observation about it more than 10 minutes after it's over, that means it's affected it me. It signals to me that there was something important there. I was completely fascinated by the characters, their stories, their lives and the way they were portrayed by some of the best actors in the world. The best stories for me in movies and in literature, are character driven. Yes, I enjoy action movies, and plots and all that (loved Gladiator), but it's the characters that really engage me. TRT has crisp, well-drawn, familiar, but not stereotypical characters.
Yes, you say  that's fine but what's it about? It's about a bunch of different things. The plot and the actions are developed out of  characters which some might call archetypal.
The dialogue which some might call ""sparse"" is masterful. It has so many layers of meaning in single sentences. If you pay attention, you can learn even more about the characters from what they say, how they say it. At some point, I think almost every person in the film says, ""what do you mean?"" or ""it doesn't matter.""
And there are subtley funny parts also, but probably not in the overt way most blockbusters are famous for today (I mean I love Austin Powers, but let's face it, we are hit over the head with the jokes). TRT is not funny in the haha-pratfall-bathroom-obvious-belittling way we are used to on sit coms, but funny in the hmm-clever-witty-thoughtful-self-effacing-true-to-character way.
There are a ton of nuggets in the film too that are worth discussing, too, like how the players wear basically the same thing, same style throughout the movie. What is the reason for that? I'm sure there are many. Also, every shot, angle, scene is precisely laid out and there is no extra or unintentional/extraneous activity going on. The effect is to produce a tightly constructed film (I hate that word in reference to movies) that leaves you with powerful and memorable images to devour and perseverate on long after it is over.
I did not know a lot of the songs on the soundtrack but I'm certain they were deliberate and this adds another layer of meaning and complexity to a beautiful heartbreaking, lovely, hysterical, immensely entertaining picture.",1027209600,4,2950,4.759765625

Obviously, Gene Hackman proves why he is such a renowned actor, and he pulls off the part of Royal with flair.  The Tenenbaum children are all cartoonish yet shallow.  The actors in those roles, especially Ben Stiller, perform them as well as possible given the transparent story holding the film together.
Another reviewer hit it on the head, saying in effect you keep waiting for the movie to become either funny or poignant, and it never quite achieves either one.  The anecdotal method in which the movie unfolds provides about one funny line every 10 minutes or so.  It's a shame the brilliant cast was wasted.",1027123200,18,763,4.62962962962963

1700503,3,B0000640VJ,"I finished this film scratching my head over the raves I've been hearing about it.  The cast is terrific, but the material is quite mediocre as was the box office.  I can only assume that Wes Anderson's dark, straight faced comedy must really have found a niche that is starved for this style of humor.
This is a film that pretends to take itself very seriously while delivering one absurd situation after another.  There is something cleverly ironic about that, but mostly the film is too serious to be funny and too weird to be melodramatic.  It really fails to identify itself.  It might be viewed as a lampoon of wealth, power and wunderkinds, but it lacks the satirical punch to succeed in that vein.
The acting is delightful given the material with which they had to work.  The ensemble is brimming with notables, all of whom are at the top of their game.  Gene Hackman is a good choice for Royal.  Hackman is an accomplished dramatic and comedic actor and he was the best of the cast members at walking the line between earnestness and the inanity required by the script.  Anjelica Huston seems almost like she can't believe she is saying some of the lines she is given, delivering half of them fighting to hold back a grin a mile wide.  Ben Stiller does a nice job of portraying the neurotic widower and father hater, obsessed with the safety of his kids.  Luke Wilson comes closest to delivering a believable character, playing the highly eccentric former tennis star that had a nervous collapse over the love of his adopted sister.  Luke's brother Owen Wilson is far less funny in this film than in others I've seen, but in his defense, he didn't have a lot with which to work.  Gwyneth Paltrow abandons her normally sweet demeanor and does a nice rendition of the psychologically troubled Margot, complete with despondent personality, blank stare and a variety of nervous habits.  Bill Murray and Danny Glover round out the cast in minor roles that amount to little more than cameos.
This is one of those films that you either love it or you can't connect.  I couldn't find enough meat to classify it as much better than fair.  I rated it 6/10.  Add a couple of points if you like ironic deadpan humor.",1027123200,,2213,4.604591836734694

I realize that it is a movie laced with dry humor, and dedicated to the proposition that even an insensitive, dead-beat Dad can return to his family and reform enough to make life better for everyone.

Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, you 2 are absolute geniuses. The mood of this movie, the songs on the soundtrack ( especially Nico ), and the actors chosen for this movie make this easily one of the most well written, well thought out and complete movie to date.

1700546,3,B0000640VJ,"I regretted missing the big screen version of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and feel fortunate there is such a fine DVD rendition.  The sound track is superb, one of the best I have heard in years.  This is the second film this year that I have fallen in love with a house (the first being ""Gosford Park"").  The Tanenbaum manse is a marvelous turreted Victorian pile with stunning windows, bow fronts, and room upon mysterious room.
Synopses made me think of Kaufman & Hart's ""You Can't Take It With You"" and Shaw's ""Heartbreak House"" two brilliant and hilarious bittersweet plays featuring wildly dysfunctional, genius-grade eccentric families.  I couldn't wait to see what such a stellar cast would do with the premise.
""The Royal Tenenbaums"" contains disparate set pieces lacking a link to tie them together.  The cast, with the exception of Ben Stiller, was likable sometimes lovable individually but nothing seemed to tie them together.  I felt as if I were watching individual stand-ups where the actors mailed in their performances without interacting at all.  Gene Hackman seemed to sense the flaw and used his marvelous skills subtly to cast a net of connectedness through the story, but was thwarted by the storyline.  I thought of the 100,000 starving talented actors who could have more than adequately filled the roles that were wasted on Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and Gwnyth Paltrow.  Sight gags (which was in essence Paltrow's entire role) can enhance a film but cannot carry it.  The best sequence in the film was Hackman taking his grandsons on a totally inappropriate Afternoon Outing.  It sparkled with fun, action, and a series of quick shots that breathed life into a movie that badly needed it.
Anjelica Huston was wonderfully eccentric; Hackman was comic, rough and endearing, and a very special nod to Stephen Lea Sheppard as Dudley Heinsbergen, Bill Murray's truly weird test subject.

But the second time I had a honest effort to sit threw it and I did. Like I seid already it is so and so nothing to brag about I don't see why credics rave about it?!?!?. Alough a comedic part is Ben Stiller playing a farther who is protective over his children since his wife died.  I do admit that there really is NO backround music and Iam a person who beleves that backround music is what makes the scene one to remeber. So that slows down the movies way much.
 All in all Just rent it or even better yet just catch it on HBO,Showtime or Starz. But alough it has a great cast thats what made it standable to watch.",1026950400,5,973,4.0785340314136125

Give me something different, give me something unique that goes out on the edge.  From the first frame, Wes Anderson tells his story in a unique way.  Also know that the movie is not always comic. CHAPTER 3...  It is easy to look at the track suits, and the costumes and they think that this is going to be a riot.  This is a film about family and genius....eccentric, wise and true to it's world.  Yes, comic things happen(In some ways it reminded me of John Irving's Hotel New Hampshire) but they come from a character based heart. CHAPTER 4... I think alot of negative stuff comes from the fact that something happens that we have never seen before, the film isn't what we expected and so we deem it boring.  This is exactly why I loved it.  Give me the unique and interesting.....Also, with the DVD Anderson comes off extremely well.  Smart, funny, calm, really well versed in film, and completely visionary.

Some issues with the movie:  Although the comedy remained throughout, the suicide attempt and some other dark parts pushed this movie towards just plain out there.

The idea of taking a bunch of very exagerrated characters and then writing them as sincerely as possible is a good one, and it works.  Gene Hackman especially is amazing as Royal.  As for it not being funny, it depends on your sense of humor.  I don't like movie snobs, so I'm not going to say ""oh, well if you don't like this you must love Jim Carrey"", or anything like that.  There's nothing wrong with slapstick or unrealistic humor, but I do get irritated when people except that style from a movie just because Ben Stiller and Bill Murray are in it.  I agree with the reviewer who said that indie films that try too hard to be indie are annoying.  But on the other side, does being ""independent"" (I put that in quotes because this was a fairly big film) automatically make a movie pretentious?  I don't see where the pretentiousness is in The Royal Tenebaums.  There's a reason these ""hip"" directors are trying to make films that veer away from the norm - the norm is usually crap.

but this film is not for everyone. if your favorite types of humor are romantic comedy, or farrelly brothers comedy (something about mary), or that teenage ""Orange County"" brand, then why the [bleeped word] are you even looking at this? go. get out. shoo!
this is definitely for those with a dry sense of humor. IMHO, dave foley (newsradio, kids in the hall) wouldn't do too badly in a wes anderson picture. this isn't a trite film full of spiteful witticism and degradation, but the off-beat/off-camera character traits, remniscent of ""i am sam"" or ""magnolia"", will definitely have you thinking and understanding that the characters are nearly real people. i found myself saying, ""i soooo know that guy!!!"" pretty often.

Imagine my surprise to read these reviews and find most reviewers give it one star or five stars. Doesn't seem to be much in-between. I can't berate those reviewers who panned the film, the film just didn't work for them as it did for me. I gave it five stars. I did not care for Bottle Rocket or Rushmore from the same director but The Royal Tenenbaums is terrific.
The cast is first rate of course, most of the negative reviews commented on the plot and did not pan the cast. The plot? Its about a father (Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum) alienated from his dysfunctional family. Broke and thrown out of the hotel he has lived in for many years, he manipulates his way back into the household only to discover he really does care about these people. The family has problems because he wasn't around and he tries to make things right. That's it. There is a lot going on but that is essentially the story.
The circumstances and the dialog rings true. If you do not see yourself in anyone on the screen, check in a few years. There you might be.

1700587,5,B0000640VJ,"This movie does something very rare.  Throughout the first act, and into the second, it comes across as somewhat detached and disaffected.  I was intrigued by the characters and the lives they lead, but felt like an outsider to their world.  By the end of the film, I was moved to tears and felt that I really understood these people.  How this was accomplished in 110 minutes, I can't say for sure.  But I've revisited the film several times as a result.
Simply put, this film is so rich in detail it truly rewards repeat viewings.  While not always ""laugh out loud funny,"" it never loses its sense of humor.  Often absurdist humor, which is one of the things I love about it.
Music plays an important role in this movie, as it seems Wes Anderson has a knack for matching the right song for any given scene.  I never thought I'd hear the Velvet Underground's ""Stephanie Says"" used so perfectly (actually, I never expected to hear it in a movie at all).  Anderson is right up there with directors like Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee in the ability to complement and enhance a scene with a song.

Unfortunately, the film in reality is a pretentious little sub-Art House flick made by mainstream filmmakers who have a need to prove they are not Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay; these writers and directors are overly desperate to prove that they are much smarter than their audience (in my opinion, a common fault with the new trend of 'Gen-X' filmmakers). Like 'Rushmore' and 'Election', this film is populated with self-absorbed characters that are all but totally unlikable (another bad trend from this new generation of 'hip' annoying filmmakers), which in the end makes you unsure of how you want the film to resolve itself in the end.
The cast is certainly noteworthy, and a particular mention should go to Gene Hackman, who is excellent (as we have come to expect) as the Family Patriarch who is trying to mend some long-burned bridges late in life. Gwyneth Paltrow looks great and gives a solid low-key performance as well. Danny Glover and (particularly) Bill Murray are all but wasted in supporting roles. The cast as a whole does a great job, and they are easily the best part of the production; the film is almost worth seeing for the great work of the 'all star' cast.

But I settled right in anyway to the fact that I was not going to bust a gut watching this. The Royal Tenenbaums is the newest, most hi-profile addition to the genre of independent tragicomedy, the kind of stuff that say, Todd Solondz and the Coens do that's really odd, but you don't want to laugh too hard, because the characters are having a time of it. Wes Anderson, the director of the movie, has given this genre Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Rushmore is his crowning achievement so far, but Tenenbaums is no slouch. Sorry if you didn't laugh like a hyena during the movie. Sorry if you couldn't deal with what this film was instead of what it wasn't-you've probably missed one of the more well done films of last year. Now I hate saying things like that, because I hate movie snobs. I don't like everything that is 'independent' or 'arty'. I just think some people rented or went to the wrong movie.

Still, this movie was humorous in a dry way, and well scripted.

Aside from the fear that everyone is looking at me funny and might soon direct their laughter at me, the worst part is not knowing why they get it, and I don't. This problem has a flip side, of course. When I saw ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", I found myself among the minority that was laughing. This suggested to me that a) the rest were laughing inside, or b) many audience members were having a bad day, or c) this movie is not for everyone. Guess I'll go with ""c"".
Come to think of it, director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson [yes, the movie star] always create films that are quirky and not easily accessible. Some critics think that their two previous movies, ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" were better, but I found ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" to be their best work. All three movies have a degree of sadness lurking underneath the jokes, and this element is what some people can't relate to. Should they should be laughing when such awful things are happening to these characters? To me, the situations are humorous because I can relate to them. They are part of the human comedy and are portrayed in a whimsical, ""you must be kidding"" manner rather than in a cruel way.
The poor Tenenbaum family! Its members are beyond dysfunctional. All of the siblings were child prodigies. Charles [Ben Stiller] was a Wall Street financier while still in high school. As a kid, Margot [Gwyneth Paltrow] won a $50,000 prize for a play she wrote, while Richie [Luke Wilson] was a star tennis player. Since those glory days, life's been down hill for them. All of their lives are a mess. One by one, they wind up back home with their very odd mother, Ethel [Anjelica Huston], who is less than thrilled to see them. All hell breaks loose when their deadbeat Dad, Royal [Gene Hackman], who walked out of their lives years ago, announces that he, too, wants to return to the roost. He says it because he has a terminal illness. This isn't true. He just needs a place to crash because he's broke. If his real purpose it to make amends, he can never bring himself to say so. Not that anyone in the family cares what he does. He's probably the reason they are all totally neurotic today. Forgiveness is easier thought about than done, and I doubt even a saint would find it easy to forgive a self-possessed rascal like Royal.
The cast performs this outrageous tale of family values turned upside down with finesse. Hackman has a field day with Royal, one of those people who always says the wrong thing, never apologizes for it, and then leaves the listener to figure out if he meant what he said or not. Huston is perfection as Ethel, a woman who has never really listened to anybody in her whole life. Paltrow, Stiller and Wilson are colorful as the children, all of whom are of that peculiar breed that experiences great success very young, then spends the rest of life wondering where it went. The excellent supporting cast includes Owen Wilson, Danny Glover and a very funny Bill Murray.
A key to enjoying a movie by Wes Anderson is knowing that it takes place in a fantasy world. If you look closely at the setting for ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", you realize that, while it may look like New York City, it isn't. The family lives on 375th Street. No such street exists. Even the house itself is somehow unreal. It's the same throughout the movie. I think this is Anderson's way of showing that it's all a joke. Either you get it or you don't.",1026432000,3,3525,4.535321821036106
1700630,4,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tennenbaums.  Presented as a book to film adaptation, it is so quirkily brilliant, that you may just watch it with your mouth hanging open and alternatively laughing at the sheer brilliance of its stupidity.
First of all, this film has some of filmdoms greatest actors in it:  Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, and Gwyneth Paltrow.  I'm not a huge fan of Bill Murray, the brothers Wilson, or Ben Stiller, but they are all quite good in this film (Owen Wilson is the writer of this film).
The story follows the Tennanbaum family: father: Hackman; mother: Huston; adopted genius playwrite daughter: Paltrow; financial and real estate genius son: Stiller; tennis prodigy son: L. Wilson; famous author neighbor: O. Wilson from the childhood of the kids and then jumps to their disappointing adulthoods.
Hackman is a slimy attorney who left the family when the kids were young, having robbed them blind and squandered it.  He was charged with a crime at one of his son's bequest and disbarred, eventually becoming destitute.  The film basically follows his attempt to ingratiate himself with the family again, when he discovers that his wife, from whom he has been separated for 16 years, may be seeking a divorce to marry the family's accontant (Danny Glover).
This film is so detailed and humorous, I don't want to provide more information than necessary.  Suffice it to say that it is surely worthy of a close inspection.",1026432000,2,1426,4.945606694560669
1700631,5,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums is the kind of film that you will be talking about long after you've seen it, and trying your hardest to convince literally everyone you know to see it as well.
  The plot revolves around Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman, who split up with his wife, Etheline, while their three genius children were still in their youth. Growing up each with their own special skills, they hit their peak too early on in life, and the family drifted apart. Now, quite some years later, they reunite, and all come together in a humorous, yet somewhat saddening way. Ben Stiller plays the role of Chas Tenenbaum, a genius accountant, who started buying property at the tender age of ten. Chas's two children are well-loved by their father, yet Chas himself is all-together overprotective of them. The lovely Gwyneth Paltrow gives a dazzling performance as Margot Tenenbaum, a prodigy of a playwright, who as a child, was awarded a $50,000.00 grant for one of her plays. She is now married to the fabulous Bill Murray's character, Raleigh St. Claire, who loves his wife, but has doubts as to whether or not she loves him back. Luke Wilson is absolutely stunning as Richie Tenenbaum, a tennis pro, who is only trying to keep the peace within the Tenenbaum family. Eli Cash is played by co-writer of the film, Owen Wilson, and delivers an on-screen performance that rivals his fantastic work in the wonderful Bottle Rocket. Eli is a childhood friend of the Tenenbaums, and currently a writer of incredibly cheesy western novels. He has always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, and his adult life harbors a rather dark secret. Etheline is now set to marry Mr. Sherman, played by Danny Glover, and Royal himself claims to be dying of stomach cancer, therefore bringing the entire Tenenbaum family together once again.
  The Royal Tenenbaums is one of those rare films which you don't quite want to turn off, even well after the credits are rolling. The sheer pureness of the script, the cast, and the director all come together in something that is genuinely satisfying. Never since Bottle Rocket or Rushmore have I been so spellbound with a movie in my whole life. Altogether, a great film rich in heart and emotional spirit, and delivers laughs that are subtle and genuine. The Criterion Collection Two-Disc DVD loads up on well-deserved special features that include full commentary, interviews, and the great quality picture and sound that DVD owners have come to expect. Altogether, a terrific movie, and yet, an even better DVD.",1026432000,3,2530,4.8631090487238975
1700632,1,B0000640VJ,"Well, everyone wants to talk about the characters... The only character worth his paycheck in the farce of a film is Mr. Pagoda. Literally, the only thing that struck me as humorous about this film was the story about Pagoda stabbing Gene Hackman and then taking him to the hospital to save his life. Then, Pagoda proceeds to stab him again during the film. That, and the fact that Pagoda was the only character with an ounce of wits about him makes him the only character worth caring about in this film.
Instead of ranking this movie as a comedy, it should be labeled ""Delusional Genius Movie"".

When I first saw the film, I wasn't quite sure what to think and I was even a little bit dissapointed by the cinematography and plot, but the whole thing kind of grows on you.
  The acting is excellent; each character has his or her own subtleties and nuances.  Where Rushmore only had three well-developed characters (IMHO; Max, Blume, and Mrs. Cross), Tenenbaums provides a veritable cornucopia of well-developed, wonderfully eccentric characters.  The dialogue tends to be somewhat sparse, but each character says exactly what they need to say at any given moment.
  Finally, there are the nuances that make this film worth watching again and again, from the wall decorations (at the Tenenbaum house and at Cash's house) to the quirky asides and flashbacks.  Another nice touch is the vaguely antiquarian nature of the film; although there are many references that the movie takes place in recent years, the whole thing feels more like a relic of a previous generation, a discarded remnant of the 1970s, perhaps.

I like the work Paltrow and Huston have done.  Bill Murray and Danny Glover _can_ be great, but the material here is so tediously presented, I thought I was watching a Kevein Smith film.
Eccentric characters are fine, but these people are not just unlikeable and disfunctional, they're vapid, which is inexcusable in a big screen film.  Not to mention, this subject has been much better handled in I'm Losing You, which has wonderful humor and emotional power.

I had high expectations for it, and I was definately more than satisfied with the way the movie turned out to be.  It was about a broken family, the Tenenbaums.  The father (Gene Hackman) pretended that he was dying and that he had to spend as much time with his family as possible before her died.  Of course, this was just an attempt to bring his family back together and he also didn't have a house, so he was using them too.  Gene Hackman was great as the lying father.  Also, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and the Wilsons turned in great performances as well.  This movie probably had the best dialogue I have ever seen.

Compared to other Hollywood films, The Royal Tenenbaums beyond perfect - 6 or 7 stars out of 5 - and compared to Wes Anderson's other films it's second only to Rushmore in totaly humor, sweetness and in it's celebration of eccentricity.
Perhaps most importantly, in this day of seen-it-once-and-sorta-liked-it Hollywood pablum, this is a movie that is rewarding upon multiple viewings (I saw it three times in the theater).  Like all of Anderson's films, Tenenbaums is dense with imagery, references, inside jokes, and other detail that enriches the viewer with each screening.
Oh, and this is the movie that made me get over my general disappointment with Gwenyth Paltrow - a great actress who rarely shows it in the roles she chooses...",1026345600,2,780,4.9465648854961835

1700702,3,B0000640VJ,"Rushmore was one of the most exciting films of its year.  As a fellow filmmaker, I reveled in Wes Anderson's virtuosity...his character and plot cues were precise and compelling.  Everything moved the story forward, and then looped back on itself, and revealed the closest equivalent to literary layers I've seen in a movie in some time.
The Royal Tenenbaums captured me with its visual intensity -- the expert eye behind its framed precision -- but I'm afraid I felt nothing for the goings on or the outcome.  Because of the star caliber of its cast, you can't help but wait and see what a film by Anderson and Wilson does with Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelica Huston in the same scene.  Unfortunately, it does nothing.  The offbeat conceits -- and there are many -- never quite gel.  The film has a couple of false climaxes that make a not-too-long movie feel like it was over twenty minutes ago.  Gene Hackman courses through his scenes with terrific verve and gravity, but the subject matter that surrounds him can't catch up.  Wes Anderson is always on his toes, but like Andy Boyle in A Life Less Ordinary, he blisses out on his own genius.  The net effect is merely satisfying.
Happily, Anderson's preoccupation with individuality and the comfort in eccentricity are all intact.  And the Wilson brothers, in character, share some terrifically understated moments of tenderness.  I think Luke Wilson dragged this movie kicking and screaming out of the cerebrum and into the visceral world of human hurt and failing.  He was terrific even when he wasn't doing anything but looking abandoned and broken.
Here's to the director with the best eye for filming beautiful children.  Let's hope his next outing feels more like a meal.",1026259200,2,1728,4.856655290102389
1700703,5,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson follows up his critical success of Rushmore with another gem in The Royal Tenenbaums. Following the downfall of the lives of 3 childhood geniuses, Anderson and Owen Wilson's screenplay is both heartwrenching and hearwarming at the same time. Having burned out at such an early age, the Tenenbaum family tries to constantly regain their former glory, mainly unable to release the past they know they need to escape. Oddly enough, the only man able to help them accomplish this is their father, Royal, who seperated from his wife (and family in general for the most part) decades before. Having lost nearly everything to his name and needing a place to stay, Royal uses a scheme that he's on his death bed to weasel his way into his family's good graces. Anderson approaches a wide range of topics and relationships in general in a fresh light, showing a unique perspective on the human spirit, both good and bad. Tenenbaums is highlighted by a career high performance of the title character by the lovable Gene Hackman who is supported by strong performances by Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ben Stiller as the grown up Tenenbaum clan. I should mention that if you aren't a fan of Anderson's previous ventures, Tenenbaums may not be your cup of tea (it might be anyways) as he and partner Owen Wilson have their own unique style to bring us memorable characters and places.",1026259200,,1389,4.815899581589958
1700704,1,B0000640VJ,"Respective to the quality of its cast, all of whom give terrible performances here, this is arguably the worst movie ever made - relentlessly dull and repulsively precious. Given its insufferable air of twerpy self-adoration, one is less inclined to itemize its numerous inadequacies than to simply beat it up after school. Unless you're desperate to pass yourself off as some kind of hipster, avoid this at all costs.
That eminent philosopher, David Lee Roth, once explained that the reason music reviewers rave over Elvis Costello records is that music reviewers all *look* like Elvis Costello. I suspect a similar dynamic applies in this case. A person who writes about movies for a living is likely to have been an art-geek in high school, erotically fixated on his female siblings as an unthreatening alternative to pursuing available girls, cultivating his semi-ironic taste in pop culture into a hermetic language with which to keep the pain of unpopularity at bay - all of which are traits glorified in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". It's not so much that I begrudge Wes Anderson his naked wish fulfillment; creative people in many fields do it all the time. What I found so intensely irritating were all the like-minded reviewers who have attempted to foist it on those of us who are less poorly adjusted as some kind of singular comic vision.",1026259200,18,1345,4.95575221238938

The viewer is not able to choose which scene or is even told why the scene is cut. This is one of my biggest gripes about some dvds.

1700707,5,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums would certainly deserve one. RT is one of, if not THE most literate and literary films in recent cinema history. This is evident in every aspect of the film, from the narration of the movie,  being read from a book called The Royal Tenenbaums, right down to the packaging of this magnificent Criterion Collection DVD.
I saw Tenenbaums only once in the theatre, it played a short time in my city, and I was busy that December. My expectations were extremely high on that first viewing, many people were proclaiming, ""It's better than Rushmore!"" Which I found hard to believe, having loved that movie so dearly. I was also very aware of the rest of the audience that day, would they ""get it,"" or would I be the only one laughing? Well, RT more than met my expectations, I laughed uproariously, as did the rest of the audience. And of course I was blown away by the sheer magnificence of the movie. All the performances were outstanding, the sharp, literate dialogue Anderson is so good at, was at its peak here, the set-design, the costumes, the music, and so on and so on, was so perfect I literally got goose-bumps. Since then I've been waiting patiently for the DVD release, and was glad to learn that it would be a Criterion Collection Special Edition right off the bat.
The packaging is wonderful, the ""book design"" of the sleeve, the Eric Chase Anderson drawings, and of course the extras on the second disc. Because of these things I have bumped up my rating to a perfect 5 stars. But also because having viewed the movie two more times, without expectations, I see even more now just how wonderful RT is. I didn't laugh uproariously as I did in the theatre, but I noticed all the subtle nuances in every scene, most of which are in the background or on the edge of the frame. I listened to the deft dialogue, and understood each character better because of it. I studied the movie during these two viewings, and it lost none of its charm, or wicked humor. For a movie geek like me I know the more I watch it the more I'll catch, and with a movie like RT you can never catch quite everything.
I'm sure many people will post more reviews here, after buying or renting Tenenbaums, saying how unfunny it was. I'm sorry you didn't get it. But don't feel bad, a lot of people don't...get it, that is. And as Kent Jones in his essay on RT claims, ""...[I]t's difficult to comprehend how anyone could NOT get the work of such an exquisite storyteller.""",1026259200,2,2470,4.488888888888889
1700708,4,B0000640VJ,"A friend took me to this film at the theater for my birthday and it was the best present I got.
All of the performances were really terrific.  It was nice to see Ben Stiller playing a regular guy instead of the screwball characters he usually plays.  Gene Hackman was definitely the highlight of the film for me.  Royal Tenenbaum is a wonderfully slimy character when we meet him, but it is nice to see him change a bit later in the film and redeem himself.  The three Tenenbaum children seem a tad bit too exceptional.  Perhaps it would have been better if one of them had been ordinary.  Still, I did enjoy them, even though I didn't connect with them like I did with Royal.  The film is brilliantly shot and well executed.  I like the fact that the humor is dark, and subtle, unlike many comedies that sledge hammer one with their humor.
The DVD is nice, with a thoughtful commentary on disc 1 and then leaving disc 2 for all of the extras and it is packed with them, including interviews with cast, outtakes, galleries of the art in the film, and an Independent Film Channel Documentary.  It is great that Criterion has done the only DVD release, rather than Touchstone doing a Vanilla DVD & Criterion doing the Special Edition, as was done with Rushmore.  The packaging is a nice compromise.  The outside sleeve is a photographic cover, which Touchstone probably wanted, but the actual DVD case has the artwork of Eric Anderson, which is in the same style as the Criterion Rushmore cover.  The booklet inside is informative and thoughtfully written. There is also a wonderful insert that gives a layout of each room in the Tenenbaum house, similar to the map in the Rushmore package which had a map highlighting the important places in the film.
A great package which I'm sure will have Blockbuster cringing as they don't normally carry Criterion collection versions of films.  This release obviously has the financial backing of Touchstone as it is much cheaper than other Criterion titles.

1700709,5,B0000640VJ,"I can even describe how much I enjoyed this movie. It has to be
one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's safe to say I bought
the DVD today when it was released. Not only is the movie such
a joy to watch, but the DVD was produced by The Criterion
Collection, which means the presentation of the film will be very
special to view. Rushmore, Wes Anderson's prior film, was quite
incredible, but The Royal Tenenbaums is just so detailed and
exquisite, that it kindly goes beyond Rushmore, and many people's
heads for that matter. I particularly enjoy the art on the cover of this
edition of the film. I believe that Anderson's brother created the
drawing, as well as other production sketches that are included
inside the DVD case. In fact, I love the cover, it has to be one of
the best covers I've ever seen for a Criterion release. It shows
Ritchie as a young buy releasing his falcon Mordecai. You can see
the Tenenbaum Tower where Ritchie is standing. Now, if only I can
find a huge poster to hang in my room. Ebay here I come!
What makes the film so great is the attention to detail. There is so much story to describe, that only by
watching the movie multiple times, will you be able to absorb every fabric that the feature has to offer.
The supplemental material that comes with the DVD is fantastic, it describes every room in the house
to the slightest detail. The sketches were drawn before production began on the movie so Wes would
have more detail in which to show his crew.
The Royal Tenenbaums is basically about a father attempting to reconcile with his family after many
years of neglect and abuse. Now, why he's doing it, and how he will do this, is another story altogether.
Let's see how much story I can cram in a paragraph. Ready? Here goes!
Ok, Three siblings, one is adopted, Ritchie, Chas, and Margot. Ritchie is a Tennis superstar, Chas is
a brilliant accountant, and Margot is a marvelous playwright. Simple right? Yeah right. Ritchie is in love
with Margot (his adopted sister) which when the news of her marriage comes around, ruins his
performance as a tennis player causing him to retire from the sport. Chas suffers a tragic loss when his
wife passes away in a tragic accident, and becomes paranoid with his two boys. Margot becomes
bored in her marriage, and begins an affair with wannabe Tenenbaum Ejiah. Let's not forget about Mr.
Tenenbaum himself, he's been living in a hotel room since his seperation (and impressionment) from his
wife. He's an estranged father and husband that needs to find a new home before he is permanetanly
removed from his hotel room. And Mrs. Tenenbaum? Well, let's just say she doesn't miss her husband
too much.
The film goes into detail of every child's past, displaying where the damage was done and by whom.
Failure is a recurrent theme in the movie, as in all of Anderson's pictures. The detail in the storytelling
is incredible, and I'd love to describe it all, but all I have to say is that you must watch this film, or own it
if you can. Chas' dalmation mice are so adorable, and play a part of the plot, as does every aspect of the
movie. Why did Royal shoot Chas with a BB gun? Why is Margot missing a finger? Why does Elijah
want to become a Tenenbaum so badly? What does the song Needle in the Hay mean? And why does
Ritchie attempt suicide? These are questions, and many more questions, that can only be ansered by
watching this excellent movie. While you're at it, watch Rushmore too. The soundtrack for both films
are great, and greatly enhance the film.

His third film is a ""toy boy"" of sorts -- more elaborate and perhaps a bit more ""wandering"" that his previous offerings. However, Wes Anderson's third film (which he directed and co-wrote with Owen Wilson) is a beautiful and brilliantly acted, directed, and written film. It is also a film that rewards multiple viewings (for those individuals who judged The Royal Tenenbaums after only one viewing -- BEWARE!).
If you enjoyed Rushmore and/or Bottle Rocket (Wes' first two offerings), you will surely enjoy this film. Mr. Anderson is clearly a contemporary auteur -- a director who creates films with a specific vision and style. The cast is very good to excellent -- with the old Wes favorites (including cult hero Kumar, as Pagoda) and an absolutely amazing performance by Gene Hackman.

Unfortunately, it is working so hard being cute and graceful and witty that it never really takes off.  The film never really comes together into a consistent, engaging whole for me.

It is about failure and forgiveness and redemption.  it packs all the punches with all the emotions and all the laughs of a Wes Anderson movie.  I think that it is his best so far ant that is saying a lot.  Very very moving.,1025308800,2,546,3.918181818181818
1700738,5,B0000640VJ,"this has to be one of the best movies that ever graced the screens... it's witty, quirky, endearing and an absolute lark! high praise indeed, except that it is well deserved. i'd like to think that this is the few comedies that intelligent people will absolutely appreciate.
the kind of humor utilized here are not the usual brainless gags and other bathroom humor. it's dark and *subtle* - so must so that you have to literally keep your eyes glued to the screen (avoid blinking at any cost) and your brain on the loop coz you just might miss out on a good one!
there are sooo many comedies that focuses on dysfunctional families, but none even come close to the sheer brilliance of this movie... the setting (uber retro; even when the kids are grown up), the parents (is there any parents cooler than houston and hackman?) and the kids (lookee, there's the token control freak, the optimistic one and the angst-ridden female); mr. pagoda (hackman's co-conspirator and the tenenbaums' butler), not too mention colorful neighborhood characters - the boy-next-door, the family accountant, the pet falcon (or is it eagle?), the dalmation mice and don't forget, the ubiquitous neighborhood cab with its peeling paint and dented fenders (a joke on it's own, i tell you)... absolutely everything that's captured on screen seems to be wrapped in some importance, like a private joke that only the writer knows.
and the cast... no words can describe the sheer chemistry of the whole ensemble... you can even believe that they *are* actually the tenenbaums! anjelica houston is a pleasure to watch as always, and she shines as the matriarch of the family, reminiscence of  morticia in the excellent ""addams family"". hackman is an absolute lark as the irrepressible scoundrel royal - not surprisingly an ex-lawyer and a major con-artist if there was ever one... stiller is in his usual element here as chaz the control freak. i usually find that most of his movies awkward and painful ( good movies usually, like ""meet the parents"" but the type that i avoid), but here, his presence is just perfect - what with his way cute kids and the adidas uniform the three of them wears! wilson is sweet and wears his affection for the family like a second skin, an epitome of innocence and at the same time nursing a 'dark' secret. paltrow is just brilliant as margot! she's not one of my favorite actresses and nothing quite prepared me for her... she really hit all the right notes with her portrayal of margot. and the other wilson, owen is pat perfect as the kid-next-door who is a permanent feature in the tenenbaum household. glover is also a pleasure to watch as the bumbling family friend, henry sherman, the perfect foil to hackman's confident royal...
and who can forget the score? the movie is chockful of the best music of the yesteryear and not to forget the more offbeat offerings.. a perfect complement to the retro air the whole picture evokes, from the brilliantly colored walls to the aging decorations, even the hospital and hotel looked as if it is plucked right out of the 70's!
""the royal tenenbaums"" doesn't disappoint, the wacky plot just thickens by the seconds, and makes you wonder what *ever* will happen next.. but one thing's for sure, this is a movie that will be appreciated for years to come...",1025049600,5,3308,4.783216783216783

I've seen Royal Tanembaums 3 times and will probably see it again before it comes out on July 9th.  Like many excellent stories, this one manages to balance an eccentric (to say the least) family and there bazaar situation with a warm believable and honest feeling that everything will work out.  It's not so much a film as a tonic for anyone who has had issues with there family or there lives in general.  Royal Tanambaum (Gene Hackman) is getting old and has been evicted from the hotel he has lived at for many years, how has he done this?  Afforded to live in a high quality hotel?  These are questions, and there are many, that can only be answered by the fact that the writers put in just enough silly stuff, so that you can't take it seriosly enough to be offended at the lapses in logic, it makes sense becouse in this cockeyed world all appliances, almost, are way, way out of date.  Old reel to reel tape recorders and a vintage Commodore 64 are in the various scenes, all the phones have dials and everyone always gets around in a Gypsy cab, everyone.  Ben Stiller and his two sons wear the same red Adidas jogging suits for almost the entire film, things like this are perfect for taking away the serious edge that would ruin such a film.  The character are outrageous parodies who are not parodies at all, there adopted daughter (Gweneth Paltro) who has always been introduced as ""my adopted daughter"" by her clueless father.  The children all had such prmise, Stillers character breeds dalmaion mice and sells them in little Tokyo, another is a famous tennes pro, and Paltro's character wrote plays at age 9 , but that was then and this, sadly is now.  Everyone's life is in the toilet and, for various reasons they all get back together and somehow it works out, this is a film with a heart and a brain excellent music, perfect dialogue, and a wonderful story.  Some have criticized this film as being to reminiscent of John Irving, there are similarities between this and Hotel New Hampshire and Garp, but for the most part this film stands alone, I cannot recommend it enough.",1024185600,4,2261,4.487804878048781

If you're not sure, best rent it first, as Anderson and Owen are prone to rub some people the wrong way.  But from a fan, I would say this is the best offering from these writers to date.  Many of the incidents in the movie are factual events (such as Ben Stiller getting shot with a bb gun by his father, which reflects a moment from Owen and Luke's childhood where their other brother was shot while cornered during a bb gun fight).

Directed by Anderson this film has a wonderful touch with an all-star Hollywood cast (Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, the Wilson brothers-Owen & Luke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover) with the combination of Anderson regulars.  The style that Anderson shoots is just so intriguing to watch.  Things are constantly appealing, the scenes, the movement, and the background action.  ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is pure witty humor at its finest.  The cast is just outstanding, all the character parts were sensational.  Anderson really is a genius at work, this movie is really that good.  The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a while, the music really blends with the picture and gives the right atmosphere to the scenes.
If you've seen either of the previous Wilson/Anderson works-""Bottle Rocket"" & ""Rushmore"" you'll love this film.  If you've seen ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and haven't seen their previous works, I really recommend that you do.  I do consider Tenenbaums to be their best yet, but the other two were really great films.  A definate buy to anyone who enjoys witty comedies with an off-beat style.

1700774,4,B0000640VJ,"However, how could I not like this movie? Unlike another reviewer, I don't feel that this was weaker than ""Rushmore"" in any way. In fact, there is more that is funny, more to see, better characters and wittier dialog than ""Rushmore"" had.
The humor is so layered that I found myself laughing at something an hour later when thinking over a scene in the movie from a different perspective. My partner thought that I was crazy on the drive home in the car as I quoted one particular line and laughed my head off.
I'm certain that this movie won't appeal to everyone. It isn't an everyman movie, although it certainly has enough surface humor to be somewhat amusing to almost anyone. It really is something that you have to pay close attention to in order to appreciate. I'm sure that there's lots that I missed, although I'll be seeing it again on video or DVD.
One of the unusual things in the movie that I only got late: While all the cars, cloths, houses, styles are stuck in the 70's, the movie definitely seems set in 2001, since there are lots of indicators to let you know this. The family is stuck in the past.
Some of the best dialog is from the narrator, superbly voiced by Alec Baldwin. He had the very best line in the entire movie and lots of other stingers. I would love to listen to only the narration all the way though. In fact, one of the weaknesses of the movie was not having the narrator narrate each and every ""chapter"" of the movie.
The last movie that had me lauging this way was the Coen brother movie ""The Big Lebowski"". It wasn't as subtle, but the best of these two movies succeeds for the same reasons. It also wasn't appreciated by everyone and most of my friends were luke warm on it only.",1023148800,10,1717,4.36875

There's the suicidal son, the orphan, the neurotic, the pseudo child across the street, the detached father, and the motherly glue that keeps all the freaks together.  Of course if you've seen one Wes Anderson you've seen them all.  Why?  No, not because they are pathetically similar, though they are.  But maybe it's because as the well read movie buff you are, you've noticed what I did.  Wes Anderson's ""creative genius"" is only that of the creative genius of J.D.Salinger.  You remember reading ""Catcher in the Rye"" about a hundred years ago?  Well Anderson hopes that you don't if you've seen ""Bottle Rocket.""  Clever old Wes is even more convinced you haven't read ""Franny and Zooey"" because then ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" may not seem so quirky and unique.

He is not concerned with keeping the film real, he is not afraid to place words on the screen to advance the story line, his attention to detail (from the drawings on the walls to the numerous board games in the game closet) is unmatched, and he can write with a dry intelligent wit that is never seen in the current media.
As for the preformances I have nothing but good things to say.  Paltrow, Hackman, and the Wilsons give some of the best preformances of their careers.  Bill Murray plays a subdued tragi-comic role that proves that he is more than a fromer Saturday Night Live cast member.  Danny Glover has never done comedy so well (anyone seen Gone Fishin').  Obviously these actors knew that this was an incredible script and they hoped on for the ride.
This film was very overlooked.  But people do not tolerate intelligent comedies (on TV or in the Theatre).  But if you are looking for great slapstick just watch the Tennis sequence or Hackman and his grandchildren.

After seeing the movie more than a month ago, I started recounting some of the more emotional moments in the film as I sat with my wife in a shopping mall eating a souvlaki. I actually found that I was getting choked up just describing the moments and my wife looked blankly at me.
""Is this a mid-life crisis or something?""
She liked the film, but couldn't believe that it had emotionally effected me to the extent that it had.
""This has probably got something to do with your family, you know.""
Possibly. But it might also have something to do with a film which on the surface seems to present an artificial and childlike story about an unusual family but underneath captured some illuminating truths about the human condition.
I obviously liked the film because I gave it 5 stars and l am looking forward to spending the rest of my life trying to figure out why.
I can understand why many people disliked it so much but I am fascinated with the concept that I have little idea why I love it.

I was unfamiliar with any of the previous Wes Anmderson films when I first went to see Tenenbaums (something I have now remedied) so it isn't a film just for fans of his work.
My main reason for seeing Tenenbaums was the great cast - and this is still one of the best reasons to watch it in my opinion.  There's some fine acting going on in here.
I also appreciated the attention to detail in the sets and the score as well - they were integral to the understaning of the film.
The tone is slightly dark, the comedy is very subtle (if you are expecting Farrelly Bros. style laughs here you are going to be disappointed).

1700827,5,B0000640VJ,"... but not in the sense that is usually used. Some people absolutly love his movies, while others really don't care much at all. It's not to say that either side is right or wrong, its just a conflict of interests. Those who don't like Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, or this film, are not in any way inferior/superior to a person like myself, but, those who are smug and almost happy to tell you how bad this movie is... shame on you.
Well, this is easily my favourite film of last year, along with Memento and Waking Life, because of it's rich use of atmosphere. This is a film about lost time, lost childhood, lost chances... really it's about losing those things which are important, and getting them back, and that is the reason that alot of the imagery is, umm.... retro. This is a running theme in all of Anderson's movies, the idea of reclaiming your past by bringing it along with you into the future. All the objects in the movie hold sentimental value to the characters (we never really learn what the particular sentiments are, which is part of the allure of the ""sight gag"") and gives the characters a past and, more importantly, a neural net of their opinions, beliefs, emotions etc, just by displaying their possessions.
The performances are usually critisized as being highly exagerated- well i hate to break it to you but that's really the whole point of the movie. The Tenenbaum family are eccentrics, the type of family you would latch onto like a satilite because you are attracted to their behavour, and Owen Anderson's character is a representation of the audience in that respect. If this family was what you would call ""average"", they wouldn't be interesting. Of course alot of movies have the set up of a normal guy in an extraordinary situation, but not every movie has to be that way.
Some of the reviewers who have given this movie a low score have cited that it ""fails as black comedy"". Well that's interesting since Anderson himself dosn't consider his movies comedies anyways. Sure there are funny moments, but they are by no means as exagerated as the film's characters are. The comedy is understated: there are no cheap tricks to make you laugh. One of my favourite moments in the movie is when Royal and the indian ""butler"" are in the game closet talking, and then it's revealed they are drinking martinis- dosn't sound funny in words, but for me it's very touching and highly comical. This isn't slapstick, but humour of a more gentle kind, like in Monsiur Hulots Holliday.
The acting is superb by Hackman and Houston, and immediatly convinces the audience of their characters histories. I feel this was Hackman's finest performance since The Conversation, in a career which, i feel as well, has been utterly underappreciated. Luke Wilson, Gwenneth Paltro are both fine in their own rights, and Ben Stiller -who practicly everyone hates in this movie- plays his character wonderfully: A boy who breeded mice with spots and ran a lucrative company at the age of 12, a father who is frightend of losing his children to accidents and hates his own father for reasons he can't articulate- Stiller personifies this beautifully. All the negative reviewers seem to have forgotten that for all their critisism, they ""bought"" them all as a family, as unrealisticly exagerated as they are, even though in real life they are all polar opposites. Bad acting?? These people have no idea of the subtleties involved in the performances. I also think that Bill Murray's performance as the psychologist is brilliant. Danny Glover plays his part with just the right amount of understatement, and equally fitting with the other actors. Alec Baldwin's dry narative is extra extra dry.
This movie just cries for a repeated viewing after repeated viewing, and has similarities to Joyce's Ulysses in the sense that there are treasures hidden within- seek and ye shall find.
If only you appreciate the beauty of the colours, this movie is worth the money to watch it, and i applaud Hollywood for forgetting its loyalties to the sausage industry for just a few brief moments.

1700849,5,B0000640VJ,"I'm a Wes Anderson fan and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" was my favorite movie of the year.
(just for a reference, the others were ""Hedwig & the Angry Inch,"" ""Ali,"" ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" and ""Training Day,"" and Ken Burns ""Jazz"" and ""The Sopranos: Season 3,"" both of which may have been on TV but are of a scope and caliber far beyond most multiplex efforts)
But ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" took me a while.  It took me two viewings to fully appreciate the ""Tenenbaums,"" and a third to convince me I loved it.
This is a rich movie, full of detail that initially moved too fast for me to absorb.  It was only after I was able to watch the film without wondering where it was going and what was going to happen that I was able to sit back and fully appreciate it.  There's a lot of quirkiness here, and that gives the whole thing a feeling of insincerity, but this is not an insincere film.
Many critics have pointed out that this movie is like a lot of other things; they mention Dickens, John Irving, Salinger, and Louise Fitzhugh and ""The Magnificent Ambersons.""  And all of those comparisons are true.
But what really struck me about the film, personally, is that so much of it didn't remind me of anything else.  The open credit sequence, for example, fills my heart with joy, just the way all the characters are introduced in a stylised yet somehow naturalistic way.  You have to love a movie (or at least *I* have to love a movie) in which characters' introductions include their book jackets.
There's also the Gene Hackman aspect.  I'm a huge Hackman fan but he works so often and in so many different directions it's sometimes hard to remember what makes him so distinctive.  In this movie, it's all on display.  He is truly inspired.  The fact that he was ignored by the Academy means that I don't have to take anything they say seriously, ever again.
Also, the scenes set in Eli Cash's apartment gave me more laughter than any comedy I've seen since ""Kingpin.""  And the scene, near the end, in the ambulance (set to Nico's ""Fairest of Seasons"") made me genuinely sadder than any recent movie I can think of.

Which isn't to say it actually has one. I came out of the film scratching my head a bit, wondering if I'd missed something. But when I thought about it, I couldn't figure out what there was to miss.
The Royal Tenenbaums ambles along for a couple of hours without ever cohering, or even trying to: the characters are wildy exaggerated in random directions for no apparent reason other than the sight gag - which invariably isn't funny (a bright red 1970s red tracksuit? Har Har. 1970s Bjorn Borg getup? Har Har). Their adventures are similarly overblown. Now, this sort of approach works in two circumstances: genuine slapstick (e.g. Abbott & Costello), and dark irony (e.g. the Coen Brothers).
Royal Tenenbaums sure isn't slapstick - other than for the occasional moment which produced a genuine cackle (for example, a marital celebrant being shoved down a flight of stairs) - and though it it holds itself out as a black comedy, it just isn't. While it has a few unsettling images, it can't be: It doesn't make a point, it doesn't have anything to say, and it ends on a horribly saccharine note which would undermine any irony in the film anyway. The black humour therefore is just incongruous.
What remains is an unconvincing tale about an unconvincing bunch of folks - beautifully acted, shot and edited, sure, and with a soundtrack certain to go platinum. But everyone - Murray, Stiller, Paltrow, Glover (maybe not Hackman) plays it straight.
Slapstick without a funnyman, anyone? Pass.",1018051200,,1783,4.868421052631579

In fact, ""original"" pretty much sums it up.  Wes Anderson has created a film that doesn't play by any conventional rules.  The Tenenbaums are a completely dysfunctional family, yet everyone is likeable and understandable, and you almost wish you were a member.  The comedy is deft and hilarious, the drama is sad without being to heavy.  The music is great, Mark Mothersbaugh is extremely talented.  The set design and costumes are evocative of the characters, and sources of comedy in their own right (Eli's appartment, Margo's ever-present mink coat).  The characters, even such small parts as Pagoda the butler, are fully developed--when was the last time you saw a movie and could actually remember the names of all the characters, not just the actors.  Speaking of the actors, they're cast brilliantly against type, and carry off their roles apparently effortlessly.  My favourite was Angelica Huston, as perhaps the only well-adjusted one in the bunch.
It's a great, great, movie, and hopefully signifies many more great films to come from Anderson and Owen Wilson.",1017532800,8,1209,5.127551020408164
1700852,1,B0000640VJ,"The hype on this movie is like people raving about  the emperor's new clothes. Yes it's got Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Gwynneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller.  Acting royalty.  How can we give them a bad review and tell them they wasted their time filming it? We can't. They're acting royalty.
People run around in quirky circumstances in a highly disfunctional family- a family of geniuses. One who made a killing on the stock market at age 11. One who wrote best selling plays at age 14. And the dysfunctional family that created it all. Granted a great premise but a premise  that was not  fully developed! I take that back -not developed at all.  I could care less about any character in this movie simply because they were not developed passed the wonderful premise.
It has a quirky and arty feel  that seems to have pulled the wool over the critic's eyes--not to mention the stellar cast. However that does not take the place of fully developed characters. Instead of developing characters, a really annoying narrative explains the action. Often  in movie making  a narrative is thrown on is used when the movie doesn't work.
Why do movies get made when they are not fully written?
I admire the opening. I admire the premise. I admire the trailer (which is all you really need to see to see the best of this movie) but what a waste of time and talent.",1017273600,2,1355,4.589211618257261
1700853,1,B0000640VJ,"...it was like looking forward to hanging out with an old friend, only to find they've completely changed, for the worse.
""Rushmore"" is one of my favorite films ever, so of course I was all over seeing ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""  I found this film had all of the surface charms of ""Rushmore"" with none of its heart - like they ripped its corpse out of the ground, slapped a wig on it, and said ""here's your new Mom!""
""The Royal Tenenbaums"" never really develops.  It was like they said ""here's this story we're going to tell you"" without actually telling it, and ""here's these characters you're going to meet"" without actually letting you meet them.  This is a character-based film, and all the characters in it were completely cardboard to me.  Maybe there are just too many people and too many ideas thrown in - there's no central, galvanizing character like Max Fischer.
I thought the Gene Hackman character was sort of a lovable goof. You don't really know enough backstory to know why everyone hates him so much, so a lot of the points they try to make about reconnecting with your family just fall flat.  They TELL you he neglected his family, but you don't SEE it...anyone Fiction 101 student can explain to you the ""show, don't tell"" theory.
And the bit about lying about having cancer...as someone who did lose a father to cancer, it just kind of embarassed me.  I was not highly offended, I was just sort of embarassed for whoever thought this might potentially be funny...I just tried to ignore it like a grandmother's loud fart.
There were a few decent scenes (like near the end when Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow try futilely to bond), but they were like finding m&m's in the car seat on a long, boring road trip.",1017187200,7,1726,4.587662337662338

The set designer alone deserves an award for this film. But even minus all of the visual aspects are the underrated performances of the actors. Sure, Ben Stiller has his moments when he loses his cool (it's expected) but he has truly genuine moments after Royal tries to connect with his sons in ways he never connected with him. Gwyneth Paltrow underplays her role to a tee, perfectly and honestly encompassing the soul of a playwright with failed high expectations. The Wilson brothers give their usually good performances (Luke at his most complex, Owen at his best space case) as do Anjelica Houston and Danny Glover though they needed to be given a little more to do. But that's one exception in a movie where Gene Hackman proves to me that he is more than just a hack (note: not a big Hackman fan) giving a uncomprimising yet harm warming portrayol of Royal Tenenbaum. And last, but certainly not least, the great Bill Murray, stealing every scene that he can get into.

Wes Anderson has created the Tenenbaums , a most disfunctional family that has not evolved beyond the late 70's early 80's. To me that was the primary aim of the film , what happens to childhood prodigys? This is where I feel the film falls down , the idea that these people have not progressed beyond the time of their infamy is not fully explored ,they still appear to live  in a modern day New York that is still strangely also like them stuck in the early 80's . I have to admit that I was expecting a barrell of laughs which isn't quite what I got, but I can't deny that Wes Anderson is somewhat of a genius . This film still ranks well above the general fare of Hollywood for those that actually want to be challenged by the movie going experience and for that we should all be truely grateful but hype does not great movies make .

The movie isn't for people who don't want to see a piece of people's lives other than a cut and dried fairy tale. I had no idea who Wes Anderson was before seeing it--it was actually just a final resort in a long list of movies already seen or that looked too awful to waste eight dollars on--but I don't feel at all that the money was wasted. I didn't give it five stars because it certainly did have its problems and I wouldn't put it on a list of my favorite movies ever--but it WAS worth seeing. I didn't even think it was that funny--just very engaging. The directors made a movie that they wanted to make and didn't care about curtailing to pop idiocy--and the best work is done when it's done for oneself rather than to please the masses. I think most of its problems stem from having too many ideas to cram into a reasonable amount of time for a movie.

It's supposed to be funny, it's supposed to have an obscure moral agenda, that's what makes Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson two of the best screen writers working today.  The art direction is beautiful, the soundtrack perfection, and the acting, to say the least, was masterful.  These actors have turned out some of their best performances here and it is a crime they are not further recognized.

1700880,5,B0000640VJ,"The decline and fall of a Great Family in a Big House has a long-established tradition in fiction and cinema, and forms the basis for Wes Anderson's 'The Royal Tenenbaums', follow-up to the most wonderful American film of the last ten years.  Characteristically, Anderson is less interested in the fall than the fall-out - the film begins with a precis of the family's greatness (the unnerving, all-round genius of the children (business, science, sports, literature); the saintly mentorship of the mother; the charming mean-spiritedness/self-centredness of the father, but then skips the 22 years in which the children somehow lose it all, through parental separation, frustrated love, the death of a spouse, resentment at betrayal or general anomie.  Some of these blanks are later filled in, but because they become the machinery of one-liners and bits, they lose force as a psychology, as a way of explaining why these characters behave the way they do.
'Royal' is a consolidation of Anderson's previous masterpieces rather than a progression.  It has the same miraculous mix of comedy and melancholy, romance and elegy, irony and emotion; and the Wilson Bros. play extensions of their parts in 'Bottle Rocket' - Luke is the sensitive brother suffering a nervous breakdown; Owen is the wired outsider who wants to belong, and whose positivity curdles into insanity because it lacks a channel.  The film, like 'Rushmore', rejects realism in search of greater emotional truths - the narrative is framed as from a library book, and introduced as a kind of fairy tale (the Tenenbaum mansion has turrets); character is often revealed by clothes or decor as much as dialogue or action.  The film's artifice and reflexivity is flaunted, and the dramatis personae packed with artists and plot-contivers.  These unreal characters in an unreal environment with exhaustively unreal 'Falls'-like back-stories, diffuse believability in a way realism could never attain.
After 'Rushmore', Anderson could have fallen into the trap of his namesake, Paul Thomas, his lightness of stylistic touch become mannered, his detached emotionalism solemn and pompous.  'Royal' is very similar to the latter's 'Magnolia', in its broadened canvas, its parodic, metafictional narrative framework and stylistic pyrotechnics, its use of bright stars in unglamorous roles, and its story of a Bad Father seeking Redemption, a Family warped by the Past groping after Release and Resolution.  But every mis-step into overwrought grandiosity taken by PT is generally avoided by Wes by his emphasis on (concentration-defying) detail; his not falling for the glamour of monsters, papering over scars with charsima; his insistence on the relationship between people and place; his ensuring the comic momentum is couterpointed, but not overwhelmed, by melodrama.  He doesn't allow his amazing actors to ham or bogusly emote, and they reward him with perfectly pitched performances, walking the tightrope between restraint and caricature.  Gene Hackman especially continues his Indian Summer of rich comic character parts - it now seems a shame he wasted much of his career in earnest-and-dull mode - his ignoble but endearing Don Quixote/Sancho Panza double act with Pagoda, an Indian assassin turned sniffy servant, is the film's running glory.  Gwyneth Paltrow is unexpectedly flowering into a Great Actress, and her dismembered finger reminded me of Hitchcock's admiring comment to Bunuel 'That wooden leg in 'Tristana', Bunuel.  That wooden leg'.
Even the house, with allegorical possibilities in its hierarchies of race, gender, generation and species, is indulged less for its Significance that its possibilities for Comic Confinement, Clash and Collapse.  Although the film has a clear narrative line, you never feel its mechanics - 'Royal' moves with such life and credibility, such winning characters and revelatory set-pieces, you never think about the move from plot-point to creaking plot-point, and are genuinely surprised and saddened when the film unexpectedly ends.  If this peerless masterpiece has a flaw, it's the curiously misjudged soundtrack, so crucial to the success of the earlier films: it overeggs the twee sensitivity with its folky acoustics, never quite trusting the viewer.",1016582400,4,4268,5.456752655538695

The majority of the American movie-going public is predictably going to be the latter, which is why there are so many of those negative reviews by disgruntled viewers who just didn't get it. It's all up to personal opinion & experience, of course, so if it wasn't your bag then it wasn't your bag. It sure was mine though. Out of all of Wes Anderson's films, I would have to say that this was my favorite, hands down. Thank God he didn't just go for a 'Rushmore II'.",1016496000,,549,4.392156862745098

I'm sure if you are a fan of Wes Anderson, you no doubt saw his first two films, Bottlerocket and Rushmore.  Each film he, and co-writer/actor Owen Wilson have made, has gotten better each time.  Watch the three Anderson movies in a row, starting from the oldest to get perspective on his movie making skills before you watch The Royal Tenenbaums, if you haven't seen it already.  His skills are critically acclaimed, yet the mainstream public just doesn't get it.  Possibly because they just don't get cinema, or because he doesn't get the exposure that a larger director would get.
With that said, this film is truly a wonderful piece of work.  The performances from each of the stars of the film are unbelievable.  With such a huge ensemble cast, one would think that some of the charecters would have holes in them, but each charecter gets fully developed and wonderfully acted on the screen.  Anyone who has seen Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray etc, knows that they are gifted comedic actors, but the comedy from Gene Hackman (Royal Tenenbaum) was quite a shock!  I challenge anyone, film lover or not, to watch the scene where Hackman goes out on the town with Stiller's two young boys and not laugh.  It is quite a scene and is histerical.  Hackman gave the performance that he most likely never knew he had.  The direction of Anderson is what made his performace truly shine through.  Both should have been Oscar nominated, but even the Oscar committee isn't true film lovers.
I'm afraid with the continuing success of Wes Anderson, he will no longer be the fabulous best-kept secret that he has been to all of his fans.  I only hope that the mainstream public can appreciate his talents as much as we have.",1016496000,5,1996,4.564606741573034

His movies have always been strange, as Bottle Rocket and Rushmore can attest to.  But they have been both funny and dramatic.  They didn't seem like Anderson was trying too hard.  This movie reeks of writing not translating to the screen.  I can imagine the script really did look excellent on paper, and if I had read it I probably would have chuckled.  But the movie comes off haphazardly, and the jokes just aren't funny.  It's not that his movies have been laugh-out loud funny, but they are amusing.  Royal Tenenbaums is just weird.  People are giving him too much credit, different or weird doesn't mean it's good.  The acting is all great, the characters are typically eccentric, the situations extreme.  Wes Anderson can obviously direct a film, his style has become his own, I can always tell it's a Wes Anderson film.  But this movie drags and drags and drags, its boring without a point.

So then a few movies later I saw anthor trailer and my autiude towards it changed. The reason is because I learned about Rushmore and how good it was. Same with Bottle Rocket. Then I saw the cast. Gene Hackmen(The Replacemnets,The Posiden Adventure,Hoosiers,and Heartbreakers)Angelica Huston(The Witches),Ben Stiller(Meet the Parents,Zoolander,Keeping the Faith)Gwen Palthrow(Bounce,Shallow Hal)Owen Wilson(Armeggenon,Shangi Noon,Meet the Parents),Danny Glover(Antz,Lethal Weapon 1-4)Bill Murrey(Larger Then Life,Rushmore,Caddyshack)Semyor Cassel(Rushmore),and Luke Wilson(Bottle Rocket,Rushmore,and the upcoming The Third Wheel,and Old School)I knew that it would be the best. I did see it and I saw it twice. I enjoyed everything about it.
The Story:Royal Tenenbaum(Gene Hackmen)and his wife Etheline Tenenbaum(Angelic Huston) bought the house on 111 Archer Avenue and had three children before they sperated. Chas Tenenbaum(Ben Stiller)was a bunisskid who understood everything about the value of a dollar. Margot Tenenbaum(Gwen Palthrow)was a playwright and won the Poultzter Prize in the 9th Grade. Her first play was preformed on her 11th birthday the last time she ever saw or spoke to Royal. Richie Tenenbaum(Luke Wilson)was a tennie champ and went pro at 17 years of age. He ran away with Margot one winter and has loved her ever since. She was adopted at age 2 so it's ""not wrong really.""He has a friend who lives with his aunt in a two room apartment. His name is Eli Cash(Owen Wilson).27 years later Chas married a women named Racheal and had too sons named Ari(Grant Rosenmeyer) and Ozi(Johan Meyerson).They had a dog named Buckly. Rachel died in a car crash the summer before the story starts. Ever since Chas has been abessed with safty. Margot has married a man named Desmond and divorced after nine days. Later she married the writer Raleign St. Clair(Bill Murrey)who does experements on a child named Dudley. Margot is having an affair with Eli who has become a writer and a cowboy. Richie quit tennis and has been trying to get rid of his love for Margot by riding on an oceanliner. Etheline has become an arceologist and has become an item with her accountent and bridge partner Henry Sherman. Henry asks Etheline to marry him and she thinks about it. Royal has been living in the Lindberg Palace Hotel for 27 years. He is still a cheat but is broke and is still in love with his ex. He fakes stomach cancer so he could woo her over and get a place to live with his friend and ex housekeeper Pagoda(Kumar Pallena).His other only friend is Dusty(Semyor Cassel)who is an elevator operator at the hotel. Now all the Tenenbaum children are under one roof in this dark comendy directed by the genius Wes Anderson.
The Score:Mark Mothersburgh composed a great score for The Royal Tenenbaums. Score Selection are 111 Archie Avenue,Lindberg Palce Hotel Suite,Look at That Old Grizzly Bears,Mothersburgh Cannon,Scrapping and Yelling,Pagoda's Theme,I Always Wanted to be a Tenenbaum,Racheal Evens Tenenbaum(1965-2000),and Sparkplug Minute.
The Writer:Owen Wilson continued to help Wes Anderson write the script to The Royal Tenenbaums.
The Narractor:The narractor is never really the main part of a film but without one here the story of the Tenenbaum children cannot not be told so I put a special section for Alec Baldwin(Beetlejuice,Pearl Harbor,and an episode of Friends entitled The One with the Tea Leaves)for narracting The Royal Tenenbaums.

And it is such a disapointment that Gene Hackman didn't get an oscar nomination, but then again Gladiator did win best movie last year (and don't get me wrong, I love that movie, but there were other movies more deserving).  Anyways if you have a pulse, don't listen to any of the negative reviews, go give this awesome movie a chance.",1013817600,2,708,4.1838235294117645
1700917,5,B0000640VJ,"Some people will like it, others will hate it, but this film should not be missed.  The background of making this film is as equally fascinating as the film itself in regard to the people playing the parts.  I was a big fan of Anderson's ""Rushmore,"" and I just love the style of direction that he is building for himself.  Needless to say, Anderson has done a fabulous job with this movie as well.
The story is rather dark at times, but each hint of darkness has got a little icing on the top.  No matter how much you will despise each character at certain instances, you will eventually fall in love with them for each of their own quirky ways.  Undoubtedly, this has to be the most dysfunctional family ever placed on screen, but you really have the sense that what they are truly striving for is a sense of self beyond what they've been plagued by in the past - the plague of being a ""Tenenbaum.""
Each actor has done a magnificent job in developing the roles of their characters, and for most of them; it appears a complete departure of anything they've ever done in the past.  I can't remember a time that I had laughed so hard at Gene Hackman in a film.  It was truly remarkable.
I think the trailer sells the story short because there's so much more in-depth-ness to this film.  If you liked ""The Loved One,"" or ""Harold and Maude,"" you're sure to love this film as well.",1013731200,2,1376,4.34765625
1700918,5,B0000640VJ,"I first read about The Royal Tenenbaums in an obscure article about costume designer Karen Patch in the fall of 2000 and the anticipation began. The movie came to my town about a month ago and is already well on its way out the door, which clearly illustrates the point made numerous times in these reviews: Tenenbaums is not for everyone, especially not people in Idaho. That said, in the past month I have managed to see it five times, purchase the soundtrack, and order the poster online. This review is for people who, like me, just had to get back into the theatres for more. Wes Anderson's work tends to trigger that obsessive-compulsiveness in people and I believe that it's because of all the subtle, beautiful details he manages to fit in his movies. For example, did you notice the clipping Eli sent to Etheline calls him the ""James Joyce of the west""? Did you notice Richie's collection of cars, perfectly alligned aboard the Cote D'Ivoire? It's because of these meticulous details that the Tenenbaums appear to have been born into the environment of 111 Archer Avenue. Anyone who calls these characters lacking needed only to observe their surroundings to learn everything about them. I loved Margot's room and especially Richie's, whose murials incidentally were paintd by Owen and Luke Wilson's brother Eric. And the acting--I read an earlier criticism of the ""misuse"" of Bill Murray, but I say kudos to Anderson for once again taking him out of his pigeonhole. The scene where Raleigh confronts Margot about her infadelity is so painfully real and perfectly acted, and Gwenyth Paltrow simply disappears into Margot the way Margot disappears into her wonderful fur coat. The entire cast did a spectacular job, but I'd like to know where in the world Anderson discovered Kumar, the delightful little man who plays Pagoda in Tenenbaums, Mr. Littlejeans in Rushmore, and, well, Kumar in Bottle Rocket. The soundtrack is perfect, perfect, perfect like in all Anderson's films, and I especially enjoyed the use of Paul Simon's ""Me and Julio down by the schoolyard"" and Eliot Smith's ""Needle in the hay"" which I had never heard before but now brings tears to my eyes whenever I listen to it.

 I love this movie, in case that point hadn't already been made. Every time I watched it I laughed (""Put one of them hickory chunks on up there Sister Maggie""), cried (for Richie, for Chas' breakdown upon receiving Sparkplug, and for Buckley, poor Buckley), and mostly just stared, drinking in the details.

1700950,4,B0000640VJ,"Here is a review from a regular guy who saw this movie.
I have noticed in my conversations with people who also saw it that two distinct camps have developed.  Those who TEND to like quality independent, off-beat movies seem to absolutely LOVE this movie.  'Regular' folks seem to be at a loss as to what the hype is all about.  Many even hate 'TRT' and can't find a single thing they liked about any of the characters.  There also appears to be a break between 'urban' fans and everyone else.  If you love the style and cosmopolitan aspects of city life, you will likely be moved favorably by The Royal Tenenbaums.  This is by no means an absolute but, something you should consider if you are thinking about paying first-run full fare for this movie.  All the characters in this movie are severely dysfunctional, wealthy, big-city folks who each have some or many redeeming and/or endearing qualities.  If you can relate to them in any positive way, you will likely warm to the movie as a whole.  If you can't, this will be two hours of torture for you if you sit all the way through.
I, personally, could relate to some of the antics and quirks of the characters.  Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow were perfectly cast for their roles and were as believable as dysfunctional rich urbanites can be.  The sets were great and oodles of not-so-hidden background details were there to note and appreciate if you wanted to.  Everything hinges, though, in the first thirty minutes.  Your mind will be set by then and pretty much nothing more will be able to change it from love or boredom by then.",1012694400,2,1592,4.563380281690141
1700951,4,B0000640VJ,"When i first saw Rushmore, i had no idea what to think.  i didn't particularly like it, but i didn't particularly hate it either.  it left me a little confused about what i was supposed to be feeling, when in reality i don't think i was feeling much.
however, some months later, i saw it again and it came together.  ""Aha!"" i said.  and i think i got where it was coming from.  while it is not really one of my favorite films, it is certainly one i reccomend to people.
Now.. after that experience.. i went into The Royal Tenenbaums thinking that i would have to see it twice before i could truly appreciate it.  That, however, was not the case.  From beginning to end, TRT is captivating.. and while not laugh out loud knee slappingly funny, it is chock full of absurd situations that one can't help but smile at (even if it doesn't show up on your face).
I can understand the disappointment from people who expected this to be a comedy full of laughs.  I pretty much knew that it wouldn't be, and i was more impressed with it than i expected to be.
I'm anxious for this DVD, and equally anxious to see what Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson come up with next.",1012521600,2,1156,4.270642201834862
1700952,1,B0000640VJ,"I just went to see the Royal Tenenbaums and was very disappointed.  Despite great acting by a stellar cast, the story was terrible and boring and you are unable to relate to any of the severely dysfunctional and unlikable characters.

1700953,5,B0000640VJ,"After viewing the film ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" I left the theater in an odd state of mind. And after digesting the film a little while, something one MUST do after watching a Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson film, I've concluded it as the best comedy of the year and one of the top five films of the year (and the same thing happend when I viewed the film ""Rushmore"" a few years earlier). Then I decided to check what other people thought of the film and came onto Amazon.com to read people's reviews. I was very distraught with what I read, not so much because people disliked the film (some people, I should not lump ALL people in this category; there are SOME innovative filmgoers amongst you all) but because of why they didn't. People complained that there were no laughs to be had. Granted, there are not belly laughs and guffaws to be had at ""Tenenbaums,"" but this should be expected considering how ""Rushmore"" was set up and executed. Wes Anderson and his writing partner do not go for the cheap laughs and the slapstick sight gags that make so many current movies the cheap, raunch fare that they are. Being a writer myself I've come to realize that there is much more to comedy than making a person jiggle with laughter. In fact, no where in the definition of the term ""comedy"" is the word ""laugh"" used. Comedy deals with a general feeling it bestows upon an audience member. One of humor and affection (be it dark or otherwise).
Anyway, to get back to the point, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is solely structured on giving off a feeling of comedy while also playing for more psychological and emotional connections with it's audience. I will openly admit I laughed outloud less than ten times throughout the film (although when I did laugh, it was very well deserved). I did, however, have a smile on my face throughout the ENTIRE thing. And that's what comedy, at least one designed like this one, is meant to do. I commend Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson for making such a remarkably structured film and reccommend it to anyone who has the desire to see the ""Thinking Man's Comedy.""",1012521600,36,2077,4.586021505376344
1700954,5,B0000640VJ,"Yes, there are certainly plenty of people who don't get Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson movies. There are also people who don't get gross-out comedy or even romantic comedy. People are simply different. And so are the Tenenbaums - different enough to laugh my way through the whole movie. At the first showing that I went to of The Royal Tenenbaums, the theater chuckled and broke out into laughter almost every minute or so for the first 4/3 of the movie before Elliott Smith's ""Needle in the Hay"" transitions the comedy to drama. While I'll admit most of the humor is subtle, tt's difficult for me (someone who has now seen the movie six times) to see how people wouldn't laugh at lines like, ""well, your mother and I made certain sacrifices as a result of having children"" when Chas asks if their divorce is the kids' fault - or Owen Wilson's line, ""Everyone knows Custer died at Little Big Horn. What this book presupposes is: maybe he didn't?"" - or parts like Luke Wilson's tennis scene ""Tenenbaum has taken off both of his shows and one of his socks and I believe that he's crying. A strange day here at Windswept Fields."" Along with literally hundreds of other very funny parts as well as genuinely dramatic moments, this film is easily my favorite among the ones I've seen in the past 5 years.",1012521600,3,1298,4.551282051282051

1700956,4,B0000640VJ,"Not to say that Anderson is a genius, but he's certainly one-of-a-kind. This nerdy auteur is batting a thousand on my scorecard. With BOTTLE ROCKET, RUSHMORE and now with THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, Anderson and his cohorts (especially the Wilson bros.) prove that smart movies can also be fun and incredibly entertaining. And RT is definitely all three and then some. As in RUSHMORE I am amazed at how much background he gives each character, usually with a simple montage, and even more so here as this ensemble cast is rather large. These are fully fleshed out creations who you know are living their lives in some parallel world right now. The dialogue is brilliant, the performances are top notch (although Murray's character is a bit of a throwaway), and the set/costume design create a strangely unfamiliar New York City (we know the movie takes place in the present because of the G4 Macs, etc., but it feels timeless and anachronistic). The tragi-comic situations that the characters go through rival those of characters in books by the likes of John Irving and Kurt Vonnegut. This also gives the movie (like RUSHMORE again) a more literary than cinematic feel. If this had been a book I would have loved it. As a movie it's simply marvelous.

Gene Hackman plays a man who put his family on the sidelines years ago, and finally decides years later, that he wants to make ammends. His wife, that he has not divorced yet, is falling in love with someone else. He tries to win her back, and lots of things go the opposite way of which he planned them! He also makes an attempt to right all the wrongs he made with his children. Heartwarming story of a man's search for forgiveness. Very funny, also!

1700999,5,B0000640VJ,"Would I say that the new Wes Anderson film ""The Royal Tenebaums"" is one of the Best Pictures of the year, yes I would. But in this world there's 2 kinds of people: Wes Anderson Fans and Wes Anderson Haters. If you hate ""Rushmore"" and ""Bottle Rocket"", then no doubt you'll hate ""The Royal Tenebaums"". ""Bottle Rocket"" is still my favorite Anderson film and ""Rushmore"" is a masterpiece. Fans of Wes Anderson's films will absolutely love this installment.

Anderson has brought together an amazing cast of characters including, Gene Hackman as Royal Tenebaum, Anjelica Huston as his estranged wife, their kids played by Ben Stiller, Gwenyth Paltrow and Luke Wilson. The neighbor kid played by Owen Wilson and Danny Glover as mother Tenebaums new boyfriend.

The movie is a comedy but more important than that, it is a brilliantly written, acted and directed comedy, full of emotion. Many emotions shot through me as I watched the movie. Many emotions are strung put through the movie as well, all put in by Anderson on purpose as he gives us a family of disfunction and yet through it all one main objective is fulfilled. That is the belief that no matter how bad it gets, family is family and the bond of blood can make it through the most troubling times.

Bill Murray brings his own touches to the film in a bit part as Paltrows husband. But Murray is no where near as good in ""RT"" as he was in ""Rushmore"" the role was just too small.

To me ""The Royal Tenebaums"" is a fantastic film that has the cast of a big budget blockbuster and the heart and feel of an independent film. One of the years best.",1012262400,3,1598,4.538194444444445
1701000,3,B0000640VJ,"This movie is the third of Director Wes Anderson's, who co-wrote it with Owen Wilson.  Owen is also in the movie as the neighbor who invites himself over, and grows up to be a druggie.
I loved Rushmore, which was the second movie, and I also was very fond of Bottle Rocket. TRT is not like either of these movies.  It was funny in some respect, but it was just far too dark and dreary to have the same affect on the viewer that Rushmore did. I did like the way that the film was directed, the cinematography, costuming, and the way the story was told -- as if it were a book or a play.  That part was original.
I also thought that some of the acting was just wonderful especially by Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum. You don't know whether or not to like his character, but he is the only character that really made me laugh. As usual, The Owen Brothers, Luke and Owen are both very good.  It was nice to see Luke not playing ""the straight/nice guy"".  His character, Richie, was a little on the dark side, and it was a refreshing yet somewhat odd change for him.  The rest of the actors were all very good, I just think that Luke Wilson and Gene Hackman were in the best form.  Gwyneth Paltrow(playing the adopted smoking sister), Ben Stiller(playing the uptight/angry businessman brother), Angelica Huston(playing the mother and the glue that holds the family together, and Danny Glover(playing Hustons' new love interest) also appear in this film.
The film itself is a drama that has comedy peppered in at opportune moments.  I don't think everyone is going to laugh at this movie.  In previews it looks like comedy, but it is more dramatic, and depressing and dark at times.  There have been so many movies made about families with dysfunction in them, and I think that the creators of the movie really try to bring some originality out of it.  It's a good effort on their part, but I don't think it is the best.  The soundtrack is also very good, as it was in ""Rushmore"".
While this certainly isn't the cheeriest of films, it has great ensemble acting and an fresh perspective into the look of the dysfunctional family.",1012262400,,2122,4.4831168831168835

Wes Anderson is one of the smartest directors in the U.S. right now, and it's about time someone gives him props.  The Royal Tenenbaums is a DRAMADY, not a COMEDY!  Wes runs his movies with a high dramatic quality, and a sophisticated sense of humor.  Ben Stiller's character, Chas, is NOT supposed to be humorous.  He hates Royal (Gene Hackman), and is miserable with the death of his wife.  Why should he be funny?  Bill Murray and Danny Glover's mere presence in the movie give it class.  And of course, Kumar Pallana, the humorous constant in all of Wes Anderson's films.  If you want to see some spectacular acting from Gene Hackman, Luke Wilson, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Bill Murray, go see The Royal Tenenbaums.  If you hate thinking, and think that Ben Stiller can only do films like Zoolander (which I loved by the way), then waste your money on Kung-Pow or Snow Dogs.",1012262400,,1013,4.5777777777777775
1701002,1,B0000640VJ,"Let me first start by saying, terrible is too good a word to describe this movie.  This is a down right horrible movie.  Because there is only one good thing to say about this movie, I will say it first.  Then I will go on to speak of the numerous bad parts and why you should avoid them.
First, the good news.  The soundtrack of this movie is superb.  I would reccomend it to anyone.  Simply put, the music was great.  If you want more information on the CD, look it up on Amazon's site.
Now, the bad news.  Let me say that over the top hilarious is a bad way to put this movie.  They say it is a comedy that will have you laughing for days.  I say it was down right depressing and not worth the seven bucks I spent.
The acting isn't great.  In fact, the lead roles such as Gene Hackman could have done a better job.  To be honest, I don't think the actors were allowed to go as far as they could have with this movie.
To put it as best I can, if you want to go to a movie and come home depressed, this is the movie you want to see.  Because at best, this movie is depressing and morbid.  There is NO humor in it.  NONE!  Sure, you get a couple half chuckles here and there, but nothing else.  NOTHING.
In fact, let me give you the synapsis.  Disfunctional family, three kids, divorced parents.  One kid grows up to be a washed up tennis player who is suicidal, one is a sex addict who smokes constantly, and one is a very nitpicky person who is afraid to expose his kids to anything.  Sure, they could have made this movie hilarious based on this alone, but it just missed the mark.  It did.
False advertising.  I went to this movie because of false advertising.  They said this will be a funny movie, but what I get is a very morbid drama with no high points.  If I wanted to be depressed, I would go look at my taxes that I have to pay.  Or better yet, go watch American Beauty.  (I wonder how that stinker won movie of the year.)
For those so called ""Eccentric intellectual people"", I say you are messed up.  If I were to guess where you type of people come from, my guess would be Los Angeles or any other city in those whereabouts of California.  Maybe even in the bigger cities.  Well, what I have to say to you people is excuse me for not being as intellectual as you.  Can't appreciate suttle humor you say?  I say I know a good movie when I see one, and suttle humor means NO humor.
Well, for you normal people out there, don't spend the 7 bucks I did to see this stinker.  Rent it if you must, but don't pay full price.  Intellectual People would say this garbage belongs in the trash.",1012176000,4,2597,4.079207920792079

While I didn't notice much laughter going on during this movie, I DID see a number of people walk out. That's not typically a good sign.
It's not that I don't enjoy ""quirky"" comedies. It's just that I expect to laugh more than twice during a film. The trailer that makes reference to Ben Stiller's character making a fortune as a youngster by breeding ""Dalmatian mice"" was not an indicator of the level of laughs. For me, that scene was the film's comedic highlight.
To sum up an already BRIEF review, I'll defer to the reaction of a 7/8-full-theatre. Not once during the movie was dialogue interrupted by laughter. In fact, the only time I remember a more subdued crowd was during ""Schindler's List.""",1012003200,3,765,4.674074074074074

The first half of the movie is an introduction to a dysfunctional, yet boring set of characters, with some poorly done, mildly amusing humor, but too much drama and real pain shown to make it funny. The second half turns into a disgusting, depressing, gory, directionless statement of how pointless life is, with a mild, perfunctory redemption tacked on to the end. None of the characters managed to get more than a light laugh out of the entire (packed) theater, and none of them made me in the slightest interested in what would happen to them. A graphic and gory depiction of a suicide attempt is just one example of the many things that do not belong in any comedy, and were found in this one.

1701030,4,B0000640VJ,"Three words come to mind when trying to describe Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" in a positive manner: quirky, witty, and delightful. I also have three words for the film: long, laborious, and quirky (I say quirky twice because it works for and against the movie). As an exercise in subtle humor and acting zeal, Anderson's much-anticipated follow-up to his acclaimed ""Rushmore"" hits all the rights notes, but his style and storytelling are hit-and-miss, and the slight moments of comedic brilliance are few and far between.
If for nothing else, you must see ""Tenenbaums"" for its terrific cast, led by Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, the matriarch of a family destined for dysfunction from the minute he said ""I do."" The movie begins with his divorce from his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Houston), which has some serious effects on his already-otherworldly children, Chas, Richie, and Margot, the adopted daughter whom Royal sees fit to disclude from major family events. As the children grow in the education-oriented household of their mother, they go on to become great successes in their time, eventually going their separate ways into adulthood.
Picking up many years later, everyone is much older, and things have changed. Margot has lost touch with her play-writing ability and confines herself in the bathroom endless hours of the day. Chas sees it fit to hold emergency fire drills for his two children as a result of the death of his wife. Richie has been sailing around the world, all the while thinking of Margot and falling in love with her. Ethel is on the brink of marriage to her business partner, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), and Royal is flat broke and in need of a place to stay.
I must say, I think this is probably the best ensemble cast for a movie since Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia."" Hackman is anything but lacking in his performance as a man who knows exactly how his family and friends feel about him, and doesn't give a second thought to it. He has a delightful way with words that makes Royal a real treat to watch, adding small touches of comedy to scenes that would otherwise be melodramatic. His scenes with the equally brilliant Houston are funny and engaging; Houston, after a somewhat lengthy absence from the screen, manages to employ a real sense of motherhood in her character, the kind of warmth and quirkiness that one easily warms to.
As adults, the Tenenbaum children are played by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Stiller, as Chas, exacts a frantic sense of paranoia that will later become the tie that binds him with his father, and carries it off with humor and zeal intact. Wilson, as Richie, is kind and caring, seeing people for their good rather than their bad; as Royal's sole companion throughout much of the film, he will try to use this to keep his family together. As Margot, Paltrow almost steals the show all for herself, playing her character's depression and restrained angst in a manner that brings to mind Thora Birch's character in ""Ghost World.""
The story hook comes when Royal announces his impending death, which gives him cause to seek out his family and reconcile with them within the six weeks he has been given to live. Of course, we soon know he is not really dying, but the change in him as a result of being surrounded by his family is quite evident, and his quest takes on a greater meaning. All the while, each of the characters is subjected to some part of their past, or their present fears and inhibitions, and must learn to realize them, face them, and overcome them. This allows the cast to really show audiences what they are made of, accepting the challenge of portraying each Tenenbaum's personal struggle realistically; of course, they succeed in doing so.
This is all done in an absolutely off-the-wall approach by director Wes Anderson, who employs such an offbeat feel that it almost becomes unbearable. I was tickled by the fact that no one hardly ever changes clothes throughout the movie... Paltrow with her single red hair clip, Luke Wilson with his headband and sunglasses. The opening credits and title sequences, the music (including the classic Peanuts' theme ""Christmastime Is Here""), all strive to elevate the movie to a magical level, but the heavy reliance on quirkiness, as well as a stark absence of continuous comedy, all seems to overpower the potential that it has. It uses the wit of its cast to its advantage, but there is nothing within the story that will provoke a guffaw instead of a mere grin or a chuckle here and there.
Looking back on ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" I realize that my reservations about the movie are my own fault: I expected too much in terms of outright humor. The laughs here is subtle, which is a tough pill to swallow at times, especially when the material shows great comedic potential. Overall, I enjoyed the movie for much of its dry humor, its strong characterization, and its wonderful use of such a brilliant cast.",1011312000,16,4969,4.80607476635514
1701031,5,B0000640VJ,"Wes Anderson's career could be viewed as if he were in high school. Freshmen year (""Bottle Rocket"") was good, sophomore year (""Rushmore"") even better, and now ""Royal Tenenbaums"", Anderson's ""junior"" release, if you will, is absolutely the best yet!
What ""O Brother"" was last year, ""Tenenbaums"" seems to emulate this year. Good ol' fashioned comedic humor, quirky characters and dialogue, but above all, a genuine message, above all, about family. Royal believes he can reunite his family through a little trickery, but ultimately, it will take some real tests of love that will finally reunite the Tenenbaums in the end. Of course, Anderson and Wilson's trademark humor once again has a great showing, and Hackman gives such a memorable performance.
I really can't say enough about ""Tenenbaums"". It truly is the movie that satisfies, no matter how long you've been watching ""Rushmore"" to compensate for the brief lapse of time between two films. It's a precious movie, that like ""Rushmore"" will stand the test of time. RIGHT ON!",1011312000,7,1028,5.125

Our local theater was closed, so I decided to drive to Delaware with two of my compatriots.  As you can imagine, they were quite disappointed as well.
Gene Hackman's performance as primate Gary D'ellabate was one of the few redeeming elements of this atrocity.  His lines were relevant and his humorous quips were timely and pungent.  Ben Stiller, on the other hand, should receive the Darwin award for his portrayal of Fred Norris, the martian.  Gwyneth Paltrow was also inappropriate for the part of Ophelia Quivers.

Hackman's recent efforts include Behind Enemy Lines,Heist, and that box office smash Heartbreakers. What actualy was Danny Glover's role in this movie? He was completely out of place in this film. Glover should convince paramount pictures to make Lethal Weapon 4. This way maybe he can save his faltering career.

1701036,5,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums is my favorite movie of 2001.  It is unlike any movie I have ever seen before.  The characters are truly unique and each performance is excellent.  Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum gives a dynamic performance.  He does a great job of showing all sides of this character.  You want to feel angry at him, for the treatment of his family, and you grow to love him at the same time.  Royal's three children are given equal time to develop as individual characters.  They each have a distinct personality that reveal different sides as the movie goes on.  There are so many interesting little details in this film that it's hard to take everything in on one viewing.  There are Chas's Dalmatian mice, Margot's missing finger, and Richie's headband.  These aspects are all part of these characters personalities, but they are not made a big deal of they are just there.  Gywneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller all turn in unexpected performances as Royal's troubled children.  They are all brooding in there own unique way.  Stiller is especially restrained as his character is recently widowed and he has become obsessed with his family's safety.  Wilson shows many sides to Royal's youngest son Richie from a sweet caring son to a depressed lovelorn man.  Paltrow plays the apathetic Margot perfectly, showing her to be both cold and caring at the same time, depending on who she's dealing with. She tends to only be caring around her brother Richie.
Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have put a lot of effort into the script that make this film original and poignant.  Anderson payed attention to every detail of this production from costume, to music to set design.  He has created a world that doesn't quite exist but is very familiar.  All the effort has paid off, this film is definitely worth seeing.",1010707200,8,1823,4.788461538461538

What did keep me awake was the optimistic hope that good actors would only be involved in this movie if it were entertaining in some way at some point.  Perhaps it was just not at all my cup of tea.  Little plot, action, development.  It reminded me of the television show: ""Married with Children"" in its level of humor.  Frankly, I thought that the concept was good, but not developed well. I felt like asking for a refund.  As a regular fan of Hollywood's best movies, I admit that I, like others, have been sorely disappointed in most of the 2001 releases.",1010707200,3,742,4.45925925925926
1701083,5,B0000640VJ,"Take a look at just about any family from any era and you'll probably discover a certain degree of internal conflict present.  This is nothing new.  But recently-- comparatively-- someone chanced upon the term ""dysfunctional,"" put it in a sentence with, and preceding ""family,"" and now, though we have neither more insight nor knowledge about any of it, we can at least define what we already knew that we didn't know.  The estrangements that occur within a given family unit and the causes thereof remain a mystery, and in the final analysis, a family is a family is a family, and in ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" director Wes Anderson presents one of ""those"" families for your consideration, contemplation, cogitation and review.  And it's quite a group; a family you're not likely to forget any time soon.
 In the decade before they separated, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) had three children (one of whom-- their daughter-- was adopted).  Etheline was left on her own to raise them, and very early on each child exhibited some unique talent bordering on genius.  Chas (Ben Stiller) became a financial whiz and was running a successful business out of his bedroom when he was still a kid; Margot Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a successful playwright by her early teens; and Richie (Luke Wilson) was a professional tennis champion by the age of seventeen.  But as our story begins, Royal, due to certain circumstances (and for reasons of his own) feels the need to reconnect with his family, and even though he hasn't spoken to Etheline in over seven years, she is still technically his wife-- they never divorced.  So, at this late date he contrives a way to gain the attention-- if not the affection-- of his wife and children, once again.  And suffice to say, soon one and all (including the audience) are given the ""Royal"" treatment, Tenenbaum style, courtesy of Wes Anderson and a terrific cast.
 With ""Bottle Rocket"" in 1996, then ""Rushmore"" in 1998, Anderson began developing his own unique style of crafting and presenting a film that he fine-tunes to  perfection with ""Tenenbaums.""  It's a style that comes from realizing a personal vision and knowing how to implement it, knowing how to convey that unique perspective on life to the audience.  Anderson uses a very straightforward and honest approach to tell his story; there is no charade, pretense or manipulation involved.  He lets you know who his characters are and what they are about, good or bad, and in a totally non judgmental way.  Royal Tenenbaum, for example; he presents him as he is-- what you see is what you get-- right or wrong, this is who he is, and he leaves it up to the viewer to assess his conduct.  And though he may not give you all of the pieces of the puzzle that is any particular character, he gives you enough to make up your mind.  Most importantly, he gives you real people to consider; people with all the flaws and foibles that you and I or anyone we know are invested with in one way or another.
 Beginning with the extremely well-written screenplay, by Anderson and Owen Wilson (the two also collaborated on ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore""), the movie is intelligent and insightful, and a challenge for the discerning viewer.  This is not a film to be taken lightly or at face value; there is a lot to take in, visually as well as cerebrally, but for those who make the least bit of effort, the rewards are substantial.  There are moments of hilarity, but also of reflection, because the comedy and drama plays out measure for measure as it does in real life.  And that's what makes this movie (and all of Anderson's work) so interesting and engaging-- the very real and unpredictability of it all that is so true-to-life.  The story is nothing less than a concise take on the Human Comedy, with characters that are rich and believable (for all, or maybe because of, their quirkiness), and presented in signature style by Anderson-- which is quite a feat considering this is only his third film.  Many directors build a career without ever attaining that personal ""signature"" that defines their work as uniquely their own, as Anderson already has.
 Leading this outstanding ensemble cast, Gene Hackman is delightfully and endearingly unlikable as Royal, the father everyone hopes they never had.  He's about as delicate and subtle as a trash compactor, but in an amusing sort of way.  The guy you can tolerate, even enjoy, as long as you know he's leaving at the end of the day.  And Hackman plays him to perfection, which makes all that goes on around him fall into place, as well.  Stiller gives an effective, understated performance as Chas, a single father of two, coping with problems of his own and obsessed with safety, while Paltrow is deliciously morose and introspective as Margot Helen.
 Luke Wilson, meanwhile, gives an affecting performance as Richie by managing to really get into his character's skin.  You sense that there's a lot going on behind his eyes, which, in fact, is one of the strengths of this film-- the fact that you can feel these people actually ""thinking.""  Richie, Margot and Chas share that common thread-- that silent introspection that is so subtly effective, and Anderson wisely gives each of them these quiet, pensive moments-- without cluttering them up with unnecessary dialogue-- that tell you so much about who they really are underneath.  And it proves that even in film, a picture can be worth a thousand words.
 Rounding out the cast-- and all with noteworthy performances-- are Bill Murray (Raleigh), Owen Wilson (Eli), Danny Glover (Henry), Seymour Cassel (Dusty) and Kumar Pallana (Pagoda).  Quirky, eccentric, funny and alive, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" will make you think and laugh at the same time, which isn't such a bad deal; it is, in fact, the magic of the movies.",1010620800,3,5848,4.831494483450351
1701084,4,B0000640VJ,"First of all, let me say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year.  If I had never heard of Wes Anderson before seeing this movie, I may have been completely blown away.  However, having seen Rushmore and Bottle Rocket probably a dozen or more times, I went into the theater with certain expectations; namely, that Royal Tenenbaums would be one the best movies I'd ever seen.  These expectations were reinforced by the critics, who  are calling this one of the best of the year, better than Rushmore, one of the greatest comedies ever.
The main problem with the RT's for me was that it was too complicated -- I don't mean that it was cryptic or confusing, just that there were too many characters and too many plots happening at once.  There have been movies that have had more characters, such as Short Cuts, that were very successful, but these movies are motivated by the interaction between characters and by coincidences, whereas the RT's is really about character development, as are all of Anderson's films.  And the problem is that there just isn't enough time to develop all the characters, and many of them are treated superficially.
Don't get me wrong.  There are incredibly funny scenes in this movie, and overall it is very intellegent and worth seeing.  It just doesn't measure up, in my eyes, to Anderson's earlier gems.",1010620800,,1345,4.717948717948718

1701086,4,B0000640VJ,"""The Royal Tenenbaum's"" is Wes Anderson's ode to the dysfunctional American family that he chooses to tell in an astringently dry and emotionally cold mannner. Anderson mines the same territory here that he did in ""Rushmore"": the American Upper Middle Class...ridiculing it's apparent faults and foibles.
Even though all the characters can produce a witticism about which we can wryly chuckle, the Tenenbaums are not cozy, not particularly nice nor do we much care for any of them except maybe the erstwhile ""villian,"" Royal Tenenbaum portrayed by Gene Hackman who brings a whole lotta life to the proceedings.
Royal Tenenbaum, supposedly on his last legs physically and definitely penniless, after getting thrown out of his hotel of 22 years for non-payment of rent, descends upon the Tenenbaum home looking for a place to stay and maybe die. At the same time all the rest of family comes home to live for various reasons mostly having to do with one form of paranoia or another.
This motley crew proceeds to grate on each other's nerves, close up emotionally and generally act in as ungracious a manner as possible.  So what else did you expect?
All of this said, the film does have a certain ""Addams Family"" charm and ultimately succeeds by way of the art of accumulation: all the strangeness, all the dry wit, all the petulance, all the snotty comments and neurotic behavior beats us into submission and we leave the theater not better maybe, but somehow wiser.",1010361600,4,1465,4.907258064516129

1701090,4,B0000640VJ,"The latest film from director Wes Anderson and writer Owen Wilson, the Royal Tennenbaums tells the story of Royal Tennenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Elise (Anjelica Huston) managed to sire (and adopt) a clan of three geniuses -- financial wizard Chas (Ben Stiller), former tennis star Richie (Luke Wilson), and terminally depressed and adopted daughter Margot (Gwynneth Paltrow) who is an award-winning playwright.  After being acclaimed as youthful children, the Tennenbaum geniuses are soon forgotten by the rest of the world and all three sink into self-imposed obscurities.  Margot, who is missing half the finger as the result of a macabre incident that I won't ruin by going into here, ends up married to a dull behavioral analyst (Bill Murray) while having an affair with a childhood friend, Eli (Owen Wilson) who -- desperately wanting to be a part of the acclaimed Tennenbaum geniuses -- has driven himself both to write a best-selling Western and into the depths of a dangerous drug addiction.  Chas, still recovering from the death of his wife a year earlier, has become obsessively over protective of his two children.  Meanwhile, Richie's tennis career has self-destructed, largely as a result of his obsession with his adopted sister.  And what of Royal, the man whose constant criticism drove this clan to genius and whose permanently self-centered personality helped drag it down?  Royal, having recently completed a prison term and disbarred from practicing law (for reasons that, again, I won't ruin by divulging here) hasn't seen his children for ten years.  Then, he finds out that Elise is considering the marriage proposal of her kindly accountant, Henry (Danny Glover).  Still in love with his wife (and flat broke as well), Royal returns to his family.
As the above outline makes obvious, the Royal Tennenbaums is not a film that can be summed up in one sentence.  Much like Anderson and Wilson's previous Rushmore, this is a film that leaves you feeling as if you've just read an obscure but brilliant book.  (This point is made even more obvious by the use of a narrator -- Alec Baldwin giving his most likeable performance in years -- and the fact that all of the characters are published authors in some way.)  This is a film that takes the most stereotypical of ideas -- an errant father returns to heal his family -- and, in its quirky way, shakes up both its audience and its characters in unexpected, often haunting ways.  Royal never becomes a saint and, even as its quirky characters and throw-away one liners are often hilarious, this film never loses its thoughtful, melancholy feel.  The Royal Tennenbaums is a moody, introspective drama disguised as a comedy.  As such, several viewers seem to have been left scratching their heads at the film, asking the ever popular question, ""What was the point!?"" Like a great novel, the point is what the viewer chooses to take away from it. This is a film that requires you to think even after the final credit rolls and all the more power to it.
Which is not to say that this film is perfect.  Its not and -- of Anderson's three films -- its probably the weakest.  Then again, considering that those other films were Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, how huge a criticism is this?  Its like complaining that Scorsese's latest isn't as good as Goodfellas or Raging Bull. Paltrow, while giving an adequate performance, is never one hundred per cent believable in her role -- she always seems like a star showing off.  Both Luke Wilson and Stiller give excellent performances (with Luke probably doing his best work to date) but its hard to accept nervy New Yorker Stiller as laid back Texan Wilson's brother.  However, the joys of the film more than make up for the film's flaws.  First amongst these joys is the performance from Gene Hackman.  Hackman finds the character's humanity without making us forget that this is not a wonderful guy.  It may be a clich to say but in this film, Hackman proves himself to be a great actor.  Danny Glover, who at first seems to be almost an offensive stereotype, also turns in great work.  To Anderson's credit, the film gradually reveals the complexity of Glover's character until finally, its clear that Glover is actually the strongest character.  As drug-addicted Eli, Owen Wilson is a comic marvel and Seymour Cassel is hilarious as always in a nicely developed cameo role.
At one point, we are told that one of Margot's autobiographical plays closed after two weeks after receiving mixed reviews.  One fears that this might also be the fate of this film.  Certainly, I know that many of the people I saw this quirky, melancholy, at times frustrating, but in the end rather moving film with were left feeling that somehow they had been cheated.  They'd come down to the theaters expecting to see either a heart warming family film or a wild comedy and instead they found themselves watching a film featuring flawed, at times rather closed-off people that didn't even have the decency to wrap everything up neatly at the end.  As the woman in front of me said, ""The characters were all great but that story -- well, there was no story.""  No, lady, the characters were the story.  Michael Bay can't always be there to explain, step-by-excruciating-step, what everything means and how you're supposed to react.  Sometimes, a director is actually willing to ask an audience to think for itself -- thank goodness for small miracles.  Thank goodness for Wes Anderson.",1010361600,54,5489,4.866666666666666
1701091,2,B0000640VJ,"Too many players and little development led to less than empathetic roles, a wasted celebrity cast, and uneven pacing. (Think Anniversary Party.)  Introduction of new and unsubstantiated character dysfunction (e.g., celeb writer's substance abuse 3/4 through the movie) does not equal a plot twist.  For a how-to on multiple character development, try Short Cuts or Magnolia.
Most of the humor was found in the movie's opening montage (similar to Max Fisher's extracurricular activities in Rushmore). And the most beautiful cinematography, the moments before Wilson's suicide attempt, seemed out of place, despite the movie's billings as a dark comedy.  Also disappointing was Hackman's racism towards Glover (a la Nicholson's character in As Good As It Gets).  Gratuitous racism died with Quentin Tarantino's 15 minutes of fame.

1701134,5,B0000640VJ,"The Royal Tenenbaums fulfills the promise that director/co-writer Wes Anderson showed in his phenomenally funny debut film, Bottle Rocket, and far surpasses the so-so follow-up, Rushmore.
  The film tells the story of Royal Tenenbaum (an excellent Gene Hackman, who I suspect will receive an Oscar nomination for this performance)and his quirky family, starting 20+ years ago, when he and his wife Etheline, played by Anjelica Huston, were raising their 3 genius children.
 We're shown the odd life the family led, and now we see the effect that odd lifestyle had on them. Daughter Gwyneth Paltrow spends her whole day in the bathtub, watching TV; she's married to a Doctor (Bill Murray) who she doesn't love. He spends his time pining for her, and studying a doofy teenaged boy who seems to have a new disease, which combines color-blindness, amnesia, super-acute hearing, and a variety of other ailments. The sons, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, are no better: Stiller, a genius who once invented Dalmation Mice, now spends all of his time trying to keep his sons, Ari & Uzi, safe from the type of accidents that killed his wife. The boys must endure 16-time-a-week workouts, and 3 AM fire drills. Wilson is a washed-up Tennis Pro; his career ended after a very public nervous breakdown brought on by seeing his adopted sister, who he is in love with, with her new husband.
  Hackman pretends to be dying, and the next thing you know, the whole clan is under one roof again, as Dad tries to make amends for a lifetime of neglect.
  There are some really wonderful performances, and some big laughs (I especially enjoyed the running ""Gypsy Cab"" gag), but there are also some really touching moments, such as Hackman's attempts to steal his Grandchildren away for an afternoon.
  My only problem was Owen Wilson: his character was not only loathsome and irritating, but totally extraneous. It contributed absolutely NOTHING to the film. But, since Wilson is listed as co-writer, I suppose he had to find SOME way to squeeze himself into the picture.

If you are looking for racuous laughter it's not here, but true humor that makes you smirk and let out a loud laugh unwittingly, can be found in the Tennebaums.  The disfunction in this family makes me feel so much better about my own family it's worth seeing again.

1701138,5,B0000640VJ,"THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS is brilliant!  It's a quirky and vastly entertaining movie, that's not for everyone, especially if you don't have something of a literary background to begin with.
The movie is like something Woody Allen should have done around the time he was drifting into ""serious"" stuff like INTERIORS.  It's as if he'd decided to base a script on the characters of J.D. Salinger, and it's a far better achievement than that depressing lot of nonsense!  I read all of Salinger's work in order about 15 years ago, and wanted to kill myself when I was finished.  (I'll never read it again, that's for sure)
I usually can't tolerate either Gwyneth Paltrow or Ben Stiller, neither of whom I think deserves their careers.  They are muted and just fine in this treat.  It's the marvelous performance of Gene Hackman, however, that makes it worth every moment in the theatre.  I didn't care for RUSHMORE at all, but I think THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS should win Best Picture.  Those fools at the Academy don't recognize talent and style anymore, so it will get zilch.  After all, last year they gave a Best Actress Oscar to hair and teeth.  Along with SHREK and MONSTERS, INC. this is the best thing I've seen this year.  I'd lost faith in American Cinema, except for Animation, but now I'm starting to change my mind.  To Wes Anderson, I say, More, soon, please.",1010188800,3,1360,4.69198312236287

However the movie eventually fizzles, and I think part of the problem is with the Paltrow and Luke Wilson characters. I wanted to care about them but they were such cold fish- which wouldnt have been so bad if the relationship had developed some passion in the second half.

I can see that point of view if you are looking for something just a bit too literal. Those who found it boring were just taking a quick surface look at it as we do of many movies, most of which are nothing more than surface. But the essence of this movie was too take a number of very intense folks (a large family, if you will) and put them together for the wonderful interactions that we saw since every character has a high intensity that must be savored for a bit before mixing with the others. No,I wasn't hysterical throughout the movie but I couldn't help being fascinated by the mix of what I saw. These were genuinely feeling people, who have screwed up and worked on their inner beings to come together to entertain us for a bit.

1701163,5,B0000640VJ,"Always a fan of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, I eagerly anticipated the release of this movie, and wasn't disappointed.  This oddball dramedy is one of the most original movies in years.  It is the story of the ultimate dysfunctional family, the Tenenbaums.  Despite their uncaring and self-involved patriarch, Royal Tenenbaum, the three children all attained fame as child prodigies.  Not surprisingly, as they've grown up they've remained trapped in the emotional wasteland of their childhood.  Royal's return to the family circle forces each to confront their childhood resentments and to re-evaluate their family relationships.  It would be an injustice to classify this movie strictly as a comedy.  The movie is far too emotionally honest not to be considered a drama.  Despite the outlandishness of the characters, they are very human and surprisingly sympathetic.  The comedy is multi-layered, from the broad visuals to the subtle dialogue, and always delightful.  The all-star cast is consistently superb, so much so that it's impossible to pick any particular standouts.  What a relief that Anderson hasn't lost any of his edge in his graduation from art house regular to the mainstream.",1010102400,2,1196,5.342245989304812
1701164,5,B0000640VJ,"Any reviewer upon this page who finds this movie confronting the ideas of suicide, family, death, addiction, denial, and obsession for ""younger viewers"" should be instantly dismissed.  Furthermore, any reviewer who claims that this movie doesn't have depth should also be dismissed on the grounds that no, this movie isn't a classic Hollywood film with a little moral at the end that punches you in the face.  This work doesn't pander to the masses.  The poignancy expounded is an incredibly subdued genius that takes actual reflection and thought to uncover.  As for the comedic elements of the story, well, I suppose that relies on taste. It's not slapstick, or dumb humor, or shock humor. It's dark, often absurd, and most of the time underplayed.  However, if you like that kind of comedy (my friends and I laughed through the entire two hours) then this film is hilarious.  Gene Hackman's performance is amazing, as is the performance of all of the other characters.  The directing was unbelievable with long, beautiful shots, as well as quick cuts and snappy camera movement.  The movie flowed all the way through, set up tension right at the beginning, allowed the audience to watch the problems get flushed out as the story progressed, and they did not conclude until the end.  By that simple standard this movie cannot be considered boring at any point.  Also, you can't look at this movie as a plot driven piece.  It's a film about the characters in which there is great depth of plot.  The characters are all so eccentric and such individuals it's hard to not just sit there and admire them for the entire film.  Anyway, if you haven't gathered my opinion of the film yet from this review, I would definitely consider this movie for the best film of the year and a must see for anyone whose willing to depart from Hollywood dramas, give a movie some thought, and embrace the Tenenbaums.",1010102400,2,1897,4.782208588957055
1701165,1,B0000640VJ,"This film is an verifiable dud. Period.
Maybe it's me, but I always have trouble relating to 'oh so depressed' wealthy characters who do 'kooky' things (like Richie Tenenbaum's sailing around on a cruise ship, depsondent after having a breakdown at a tennis tournament... or Margot Tenenbaum's cigarette smoking that nobody knows about, not even her husband-- I don't get this at all. If my girlfriend smoked, I'd figure it out pretty quickly). I suppose it wouldn't be utterly boring if these quirks were supported by actual DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER!!! No one says anything towards deveolping themselves as real human beings and narrative gaps are filled in by omnicient narrator Alec Baldwin.
Think about that for a minute.
If I were to tell you, gentle reader, that I'm going to take you to a film where a Baldwin narrates each 'chapter' of the film for you so that you'll know why everyone is so dour, anxious and devoid of personality WOULDN'T YOU RUN SCREAMING? I would have. But, then again, I didn't know it was a Baldwin until afterwards. Knowing this has signed, sealed and delivered my total distaste for this film.
Now there are other hideous cinematic crimes committed here. First and foremost is the misuse of Bill Murray. Ingeniously written and played in 'Rushmore', but here he's made a cuckold (in, and by, the film).
This is also a film where, except for Hackman (and Glover/Huston during their more tender moments), no one smiles. No one shows even the slightest inclination to move one inch towards the other end of the emotional spectrum. Yeah, everyone's depressed. I get it. But even the depressed crack a smile now and again, don't they? Can't someone in this film be human? Jeez... I saw 'A Beautiful Mind' and it's protagonist has a lot to be despondent about but he delivers some COMIC RELIEF every now and then. Why not in this film which purports, in part, to be comedy? Wes, Owen... they've got some great new pharmaceuticals for whatever condition it is that your condition is in. Try popping a few of them before making your next 'dramedy', ok? OK.
What else was bad? Oh, Anjelica Huston was a wasted talent here... Stiller over-acted and was too angry (but why? Oh yes. Alec told me why at the beginning of that 'chapter')... Paltrow unimpressive as usual... really hokey ending which I laughed at after the film was over (including an awkward nod to 'The Graduate' when Owen Wilson comes barelling down the street in a white convertible sports car to interrupt a Tenenbaum wedding)... some inappropriate drama which goes nowhere (Richie's attempted suicide)... and misuse of 'quirky' soundtrack featuring The Clash, Bob Dylan or Nick Drake or whoever (Anderson uses such music as a cheap device for getting out of a scene that's falling apart)
What was good? Hackman. He's good in everything. Also the scene where Richie throws the tennis match. I laughed hard at that scene.
Don't dismiss Wes Anderson entirely. 'Rushmore' was a great film and gets five stars from me. 'Tenenbaums'? Pass.",1010102400,5,3024,4.87378640776699

I've been looking forward to this film for a about 4 months, ever since I checked out the preview on the inernet. I wanted to see it so bad because Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors of all time and Rushmore is my 2nd favorite film.
Alot of the audience was laughing at the suttle wit and comedy the camera had.  I felt they just didn't get understand it.  I figured many of them were there just to see the cast.  That's not to say the cast is bad.  Almost every one of the actors/actresses gives an amazing performance.  I've never see Ben Stiller this serious before.  Gene Hackman deserves an oscar for this, as does Gwen Paltrow.
On some parts of the film I couldn't stop lauhing.  And on some parts I was dead silent.  The film takes so many different twists turns, kinda like a rollercoaster.
And to the end the review I will say this: Wes Anderson deserves an oscar.  First they pass him by for Bottle Rocket.  Then they say there gonna nominate Rushmore for best film, once again they pass it by.  I really hope the Royal Tennenbaums snags atleast one.",1010016000,3,1335,4.3562753036437245

Top honors should go to Co-writer Owen Wilson And Co-writer/director Wes Anderson because they have put together a film that is completely original, funny and moving at the same time.

That is kind of what I liked most about this film. It has unexpected scenes of humor in it that you just don't expect.

1701203,2,B0000640VJ,"Well, I guess this is one of those films that highbrow critics will drool over, and I'll just shrug my shoulders.  I found this movie to be almost totally devoid of humour, drama or interesting, empathetic characters.  The thin plotline generally consists of random, quirky scenes thrown together with no dramatic momentum or character development.  The fine cast is wasted here, playing characatures instead of characters, identifiable only by whatever eccentricities the writers assign to them (this movie's idea of humour is that the Tennenbaum offspring wear the same outfits they wore as children.  Hilarious.).  The audience I saw this film with sat in dead silence the whole time.
I say all this as a major fan of RUSHMORE, one of the greatest American comedies in years.  Some of the above criticisms were also leveled at RUSHMORE, but in that film we had more time to get to know the characters, and could see the humanity beneath their eccentricities.  The poolside party scene with Bill Murray, for example, is strange yet heartbreaking for anyone who has experienced the end of a relationship (most everyone).
But there are simply too many characters in TRT for us to get to truly know any of them.  So what we are left with is a parade of strange characters that grows tiresome.  It's obvious that Wes Anderson was trying to make a darker film with TRT, but it's hard to know what to feel at the end.  The film is too quirky and disjointed to be either dark or funny.
In a way, Anderson (at least with this film) is in danger of becoming the next David Lynch - becoming so carried away with creating unpredictable, eccentric films that he ups the ante with each subsequent film, alienating all but his core audience.  It's too early in Anderson's career to totally lose faith, but here's hoping that he remembers to inject more humanity into his next project, and not try to dazzle us with how anti-mainstream he can be.",1009411200,4,1933,4.740298507462686

What a well thought out script and adaptation by director Wes Anderson. It is a film populated almost entirely by supporting actors and is not a movie for everyone.

1701209,5,B0000640VJ,"Like ""Rushmore"", it's less sprawling older brother, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" enveloped me in a blissful feeling while I was watching it, only to leave me questioning if it was at all substantial once the credits rolled.  Come the next morning, for both films, I concluded that they were indeed substantial, and damn near perfect.
""Tenenbaums"" tackles two of my favourite cinematic themes: genius and loneliness.  Genius, in that the three Tenenbaum children were once prodigies (in business, playwriting, and tennis).  Loneliness, in that this genius has alienated them from a world that doesn't understand them.  So what do you do when the world spits you out?  You go home.  The problem here is that home, and the family who lives there, is not nearly as comforting as it needs to be.
Said family is led, mostly in absentia, by Royal Tenenbaum.  Gene Hackman plays Royal with buckets of joie de vivre, but also some healthy cynicism.  This dichotomy is no better exemplified than in my favourite line from the movie.  Royal remarks that the past six days, during which he has been duplicitously reunited with his family, have been some of the best day of his life.  The voice-over narrator (a surprisingly effective Alec Baldwin) says, ""Immediately after saying that, Royal realized it was true.""  Royal is a man of charming bigotry and charlatanism.  He's a self-described [jerk], but he's desperate, and sometimes desperation breeds genius.  In this case, it literally does.  Hackman, in what is the film's showiest role, is actually quite spare.  Which works well, because the script is so odd that too much energy from its actors would knock it over.
The rest of the cast, following Hackman's lead, is downright laconic.  But as above, it works.  Gwyneth Paltrow looks sleepy most of the time, owing as much to her heavy eyeliner as to her passive acting.  Bill Murray, Danny Glover, and Angelica Huston, all actors who can tear up the screen if they wanted to, are finely subdued here.  Most noteworthy is Luke Wilson, who hadn't impressed me up till now with his acting, but I think he does the best job here.  He plays Richie Tenenbaum, former tennis ace, and the bridge between Royal and the rest of the family.  The scene where they show him breaking down on the tennis court (""he's taken off both shoes, and one sock... it appears that he's crying"") is genuinely heartbreaking.  Luke, who's always just been just the less talented Wilson brother to me, is still just that.  But he's narrowed the gap considerably.
Even though everyone is, not exactly quiet, more restrained and gentle and sad, the movie manages to deliver a surprising amount of belly laughs.  Only not where you'd expect them.  You have to pay close attention to the details to find the belly laughs.  Trust me, though, they're there.
The more talented Wilson brother, Owen, does triple duty here.  He not only produces and acts in the movie (this guy has such a strange and addictive rhythm to his acting, I always wish he was on screen more; here he has a small, but integral, role as a literary cowboy with a drug problem), but he also co-wrote the screenplay with director Wes Anderson.  And as they did on ""Rushmore"", these two have nurtured a wonderful script between them.  It sets up its story as a literary narrative, signaling scene changes by showing the chapter pages from a biography on the Tenenbaums.  It has no use for Hollywood convention, but isn't so avant-garde that a mainstream audience will feel left out.  And it takes its time and its own path to get to a very satisfying conclusion.
Anderson, in his role as director, certainly has a distinct and effective visual style.  He sets each scene like a wonderful tableau.  The actor's face is front and centre in the frame, but he loads up the periphery with so much detail, you could spend a whole viewing of the film examining the furnishings and backgrounds and be just as entertained.  Come to think of it, this is a movie that proves the axiom, ""God is in the details"" (the details again!  This must be important).  Only Anderson is confidant enough to never have to explain the details.  Why do the characters always wearing the same clothes?  Why is one of Chas Tenenbaum's (Ben Stiller, in a less than memorable role) sons named Uzi?  Why does Eli Cash (Owen Wilson's lifelong neighbour of the Tenenbaums) wear tribal war paint to a wedding?  Why is Raleigh St. Claire's (Bill Murray) unrelated young patient omnipresent?  I relished these details, mainly because the 'why' of it all doesn't really matter.  Some directors would have tried to explain their quirks.  Anderson doesn't need to.  He prefers life's beautiful, unexplained mysteries.  If you can't stand unanswered questions, if you need everything laid out for you in neat little piles, if you abhor human eccentricity, this movie isn't for you.
Anderson also shows that his forte for choosing appropriate music was not a fluke.  The soundtrack is strong and effective.  From a haunting instrumental of ""Hey Jude"" which plays over the opening credits, to the playing of a Rolling Stones record in a child's camping tent, which goes from the acid oddness of ""She Smiled Sweetly"" to the comfortably pop of ""Ruby Tuesday"", to Mark Mothersbaugh's score (he also did ""Rushmore's"" score, and once upon a time led Devo) of relentless acoustic guitar noodling, the music is integral, wispy, and perfect.
Well, I'm running out of room here, and I don't feel like I've scratched the surface of how good this movie really is.  I didn't even get to talk about Pagoda, or the great visual joke at the end concerning the changing colour of Chas' track suit, or...  Actually, that's probably for the better.  Because there are so many things here that you deserve to discover for your self.  Keep your eyes open wide.",1008979200,15,5821,4.817540322580645
