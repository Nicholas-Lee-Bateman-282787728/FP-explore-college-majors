8154011,5,B000K2UDBY,"Seems that the first reviewer tries to promote his industry; private classes. Actually, any instructional video should be supplemental to group classes or private classes.  Yet; if you pass the beginner level and have a partner, an instructional video could be a replacement for classes.
I am dance instructor for 8 years running my own studio Zack's Dance Loft.  Instructional video should be judged by the teaching quality not the production. I give it 5 starts for the teaching and the routines. Production quality is irrelevant. If you are looking for a 5-stars production quality go see movie. If you want to learn the hustle, this one is not bad.

8154012,1,B000K2UDBY,"If you want to learn the hustle,spend your money by taking a private lesson at a reputable studio. I am learning to become a ballroom instructor and purchased Grant Austin's Hustle series to supplement the course. I can't believe they can make videos this bad.
For starters the quality of the reproduction from tape to digital is very poor. Even on a small screen, there is no detail.
The production itself has a cheap backdrop which is one-dimensional, I still don't get why they are dancing the hustle to a backdrop which looks like a farm. The ambient noise drowns out the instructor's voice with a pronounced echo, as if they are in a gym locker. But the worst aspect is the content. Austin is joyless and mechanical and goes through the amalgamations without really explaining what he is doing. His assistant is talented and beautiful, yet he has no chemistry with her and throws her around like a sack of potatoes. I can't believe I can't find a decent Hustle video; made for digital would be a plus. You will be very disappointed with this one. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I recommend you get any dance video with Vicki Regan and Ron De Vito ""You Can Dance"" series. They are wonderful together and produce a quality dance video(the reproduction to digital is well-done).",1207958400,,1293,4.650655021834061
