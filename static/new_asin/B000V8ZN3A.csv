8217342,5,B000V8ZN3A,"Wow!
This is the Captain and Tennille at their best!
They simply shine in this slick and sexy special.
Toni dosen't seem to like to talk about it, but she actually was extremely sexy during this period of time.  Outfitted in beautiful gowns designed by Bob Mackie and sporting a new haircut and slimmer figure than in earlier shows, she sizzles with sensuality.  Losing his hat and demonstrating his love for music also allowed Daryl to be seen for what he truly was, an amazing musician.

The image change was of course only the wrapping for what is truly great about this show, the immense and very versatile talent of Toni and Daryl.
Very few singers today woud be able to sing torch songs with confidence right next to Ella and quickly switch to soulful country with the great Glen Cambell.  The classical piano duet is amazing, and shows that true musical talent cannot be faked (as is so often attempted today).

While the Captain and Tennille were unfortunately limited by the image they helped create, this special shows the pure musical authenticity that enabled them to achieve such great success.  The closing song, ""Dream"" ends with a simple and romantic dance.  It is the perfect ending. Respect for the music and each other that remains to this day.

Bravo Toni and Daryl!

8217343,4,B000V8ZN3A,"Although most of the C&T variety hours on ABC suffered from the constraints of  network TV's concept at the time (monologue, song, comic skit, ""...and now my guest star"", etc.), this special does not follow these rules - and as a result is an above-average music special from the end of the variety era.

The show starts off with their big hit at the time ""You Never Done It Like That"" - which is a textbook example of the way they shot a musical number at the time. Then after the titles you have these two performers playing a classical piece at facing pianos, telling us about their musical families. This sets the tone and is immediately followed by Ella Fitzgerald, singin' and swingin' as only she can. Toni then joins her for a great medley of torch songs. Later C&T talk to Glen Campbell about their connection to The Beach Boys, then they all perform together.

Only a couple years later, MTV would change the way music was promoted on TV - and unfortunately usher back out the practice of live performance, as most music videos were lip-synched and choreographed mini-musicals.

These shows have the energy of live performing (except for one concept number Toni lip-syncs toward the end.) Thankfully live performing is starting to come back with shows like American Idol. Now if we can just get them to keep the camera on the performer...

Video transfer is very good - on par with 2"" master material of that era.
With all this music and these great performers, it's amazing this special is even available in its original broadcast length. At this price, my little retro trip back to 1979 was a bargain.",1192838400,8,1613,4.6456140350877195
