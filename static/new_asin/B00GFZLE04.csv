8622677,5,B00GFZLE04,"Bobby Clark was a very funny comedian, im'almost sure the Marx brothers have seen him from their theater days.
McCullough was not a very good straight man so it stands to reason that he was very depressive hence his tragic death.
quality quite good for Alpha!",1438646400,,259,4.6521739130434785
8622678,3,B00GFZLE04,"A mixed bag of RKO two-reelers featuring the pre-Code lunacy of Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough. The vaudevillian surrealism works best in lively gems such as ""The Gay Nighties"" (1932), ""Snug in the Jug"" (1933) and ""Kickin' the Crown Around"" (1933). When the daffy duo tries to salvage the unsalvageable  ""Everything's Ducky"" (1934) being a definite low point  the results are excruciating. Hopefully, a future Clark and McCullough collection will incorporate the team's best shorts: ""Odor in the Court"" (1934) and ""Alibi Bye Bye"" (1935). Good prints from Alpha for a change.",1427241600,6,575,5.239130434782608
8622679,4,B00GFZLE04,"Clark & McCullough had a brief run in the 20's and 30s.  Many of their early talkies for Fox were lost in a fire. But their RKO talkies from the 30s are intact.  I love watching these films.  They used to air locally at 2am when i was a kid and I'd struggle to stay up to see them.  They are very strange.  Clark's eyeglasses are painted on and he has a Groucho way about him.  The films are a little naughty and very surreal. McCullough has basically no role whatever except to grunt now an again.

The two were childhood friends and actually joined a circus for a while before getting into vaudville and going to Broadway in a series of hits.  Then film.

I'd give a lot to see some of those Fox two reelers.  There are two on You tube and they are even better produced than the ones in this collection.  And a bit more ribald.  All of these were pre-code.  McCullough committed Hare Kare and the duo was done. Too bad.  They were unique and I can't get enough of them.  I took a star off because the prints have not been restored and are a bit rough.",1423180800,3,1053,4.1182266009852215
8622680,2,B00GFZLE04,Awful............not funny........these two are not clowns and deserved to be unrecognized over the years.,1422057600,,106,6.642857142857143
8622681,5,B00GFZLE04,Not bad for an Alpha release. Pretty sharp transfers from decent prints. I like Clark and McCullough and this disk is a good introduction to them.,1420243200,4,146,4.653846153846154
8622682,4,B00GFZLE04,this comedy team has been forgotten but should be remembered. buy this dvd and sit back and enjoy,1417219200,,97,4.444444444444445
8622683,4,B00GFZLE04,"Bobby Clark wrote all the material and gave himself nearly all the punchlines. But it was Paul McCullough who wrote the finale to their partnership by slashing his own throat and wrists in a barbershop in 1936. Paul's suicide will probably overshadow their comedy forever. But in their day, they were contenders. This disk contains about half of their two-reelers from the early thirties, and they all have their elements of comedy greatness. ""Kicking the Crown Around"" is just as nutzoid as ""Duck Soup"". It would be nice if there were some extras to sweeten the pot.",1394668800,3,567,4.855670103092783
