1630003,5,B00005N914,"This is a wonderful movie. It is full of the message of unconditional love.  The love that is shown to the medically fragile girl in this picture is fun to watch because it is so sincere and pure. The movie gives one a feeling that no matter how bad it gets in one's life, there is always hope to see the situation in a better more positive light.  This is a story about love, life and relationships.  For once, a movie that doesn't have to have guns and violence to make an impact.  I admire Hallmark for that.
This was a great family movie.  As the father of a severely autistic child, I appreciate the kindness toward a special child shown in this film, a kindness that should be emulated across the globe.
Campbell Scott puts in a great acting performance in this one!

It givs a great sense of hope that no matter what the situation is, everything will work out.  Campbell Scott ad Kimberly Williams were phenominal together.

1630007,5,B00005N914,"Based on the novel by Luanne Rice, this positive family film deals with some hard issues: abortion, childhood disability, single parenting, grieving the death of a spouse and father, domestic violence, and substance abuse. That doesn't sound like a great mix for family entertainment, but although realistic, it is tastefully done. It is also is completely clean without swearing and doesn't dwell on the unhappy scenes. It has some good messages with a happy ending, and all the loose ends are nicely resolved. Probably the main theme of the story is the value of human life, but also that when you truly love someone you are willing to give of yourself.
Dianne Parker (Kimberly Williams) and Mark McCune (Eric Close) marry and are expecting their first child. When they find out that their unborn child will be severely disabled, Mark urges Dianne to have an abortion. She refuses and Mark abandons the family leaving her to be a single parent. Mark's brother, David (Campbell Scott), is a friend of Dianne's who has been secretly in love with her since before she was married to his brother. He is conveniently a pediatrician and is a great help to Dianne. Worried for Dianne's heath because she is overworking herself, he arranges for Amy (Alexa Vega) to work as a mother's helper over the summer. Amy has a very bad home situation and her mother is an alcoholic. Amy develops a strong friendship with Julia, Dianne's daughter, to the point where they can almost read each other's minds.
This movie has superb acting by all the cast, especially young Alexa Vega and Kimberly Williams. Alexa really steals the show! I also noticed that twin girls (Amanda & Caitlin Fein) play the part of Julia. If they are not disabled (and even if they are) they did some pretty good acting. The most disturbing scenes are those that involve Amy's mother's abusive boyfriend, especially the one in which he tries to kill Amy's puppy. It all turns out okay, but parents should be warned that it is pretty frightening. It is also disturbing when Julia has seizures and children may need some explanation before viewing the film.  Amy's mother gets help and we realize by the end that Amy and her mother will have a good future together.
A strong message in the film is the fact that although Julia's life will be cut short because of her serious medical condition, the 6 years that she has lived are not wasted, that both she and her mother have been changed as the result of her life.
I would strongly recommend this movie, but better get out the Kleenexes before the climax! Oh, and the ending is just so cute.",1031702400,81,2598,4.70989010989011

1630009,5,B00005N914,"I bought this tape mainly because I am a fan of Eric Close.  I was slightly disappointed at first as Eric Close is not the lead actor in this movie.  He also plays a selfish and unsupportive husband of Dianne Parker-McCune (Actress - Kimberly Williams).  However, don't let this put you off.  The story is so touching and real.  I was moved to tears after watching the entire show.
Kimberly Williams is so beautiful and she portrays a mother who will give up anything for her handicapped child (Caitlin Fein).  Her husband, Eric Close, was unhappy with the idea of having a handicapped child in the family.  He then abandoned Kimberly and went on a sailing trip.  Kimberly was left all alone to take care of her child.  Despite all hardships, Kimberly managed to keep her family together.  David McCune (Actor Campbell Scott) is Kimberly's brother-in-law.  He is a doctor and he has always liked Kimberly.  The friendship between Kimberly and Campbell grew stronger and their love blossomed.
This is a wonderful story about love and sacrifice.  If you're an Eric Close fan, you should purchase this video.  Eric Close looks hotter than ever.  If you're not a fan of any actor or actress, you should also watch this movie.  It made me realize that life is full of little surprises.  Hold on to hope and it will lead to your desired happiness!!!",1002672000,7,1343,4.695278969957082

1630026,5,B00005N914,A good story from Hallmark and one that many can probably relate to in making wrong choices in relationships.  Sometimes the wrong choices are right ones for proving the strength and love people have for each other.  For 6 years Diane defends her absentee husband and the father of their completely handicap daughter whom he has never seen.  Her actions makes the man who really loves her remain in the shadows.  The birth defects don't take away all of life's essentials for Julia as she is able to have a friend to tell stories to and share her deepest secrets with.  Diane finally gets it right in providing herself with a good husband and her daughter in her final months with the best father she could ever have.  Good story well performed.  Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Cambell Scott are good together.,1424390400,2,809,4.735714285714286

The story setup, the arc of the plot, the characters and acting are all exemplary, but I had a real problem with the editing. Either the version I saw had been chopped up to allow more commercial inserts, or the original pacing and exposition were badly misjudged. Many scenes ended abruptly, others seemed to begin in the middle of conversations, and at least one major plot point toward the end just came out of nowhere. (SPOILER HERE!) Not that car wrecks are ever expected, but in this case there was no setting of the scene at all: One moment two characters are talking in one place, and the next they're someplace else entirely and caught up in a muddle of jarring sounds and incomprehensible camera moves. There's no context whatsoever. So many previous posts have praised the movie that I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, but unless I can be convinced that the copy I saw wasn't the way it was originally presented, I'll pass on trying to sit through it again.",1311724800,,1085,4.540816326530612

The movie shows true devotion of a mother to her special needs child.  She new before Julia was born that more then likely she won't live past her 6th birthday.  She didn't care.  Julia was her child and she was going to do what she had to do to give her the best life possible no matter how short or long it might be.

I love a good romance.  My favorite is The Thorn Birds so that should give you an idea of what I really enjoy.  I'll be buying ""Follow the Stars Home"" and I know I'll be watching it often.

Campbell Scott plays a doctor who is totally devoted to his sister-in-law and her child (who was born disabled), yet he doesn't step over the line...he's a true gentleman.  Eric Close (who plays Kimberly's husband) also acts well as Campbell's brother and Kimberly's husband.  He can't deal with his daughter's disabilities, but still loves his wife.  Kimberly's character (Dianne) learns the true meaning of love whereas Eric's character still is shallow and uncompromising.  During the 6 years they are apart Kimberly grows as a single parent who loves her daughter no matter what and who is at ease with herself and the choices she has made.  Eric on the other hand, still hasn't learned that love which comes from the heart overcomes many obstacles and can include the love of a daughter who is disabled.  The story also includes other contemporary issues such as domestic violence, the loss of a beloved husband, and alcoholism.  The story is well written to create down to earth characters and has a happy ending even though Kimberly's character thought it was too late...a must see, I've added this one to my DVD library.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Follow-The-Stars-Home/dp/B00005YNRH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Follow The Stars Home</a>",1262995200,2,1392,5.626794258373206

1630063,2,B00005N914,"I have read the book and seen the film, and they are just okay. Kimberly Williams indeed is devoted to her severely disabled child, if a little unrealistically. NEVER a snarky, exhausted, angry moment from either her or her mother, not even one, and never a hair out of place either. In direct contrast to ""good mom"" is ""bad mom,"" Amy's mother. While Alexa Vega does shine here, she is indeed a very good young actress, Amy's story makes my blood boil.  Yes, her mother is a depressed, grieving widow but also completely emotionally neglecting her young daughter and the one who brought Buddy into the house even though she knows he mistreats Amy. Buddy was a bit sanitized in the film, as in the book he beats the puppy and Amy badly and then takes them to the bridge, where he throws the puppy off. Amy jumps off both to save the puppy and to escape Buddy, who is about to rape her. In book and film Buddy has endangered her child's life, yet all Amy's mother has to do is go to rehab, no legal consequences whatsoever, and all is well. I thought the scene between Dianne and Amy's mother ludicrous, when she was attempting to justify her behavior by saying, "" I drink to be able to sleep."" I wanted Dianne to stop looking sympathetically at her and tell her firmly that it was time for her to wake UP, that her boyfriend nearly killed her daughter.
 I feel this ""permissible amnesia"" sends a bad message, that no matter what you do or let someone else do to your child, to the point of murder, all that is necessary is to go to rehab, have every right to demand your child back, and supposedly live happily ever after.",1252368000,3,1621,4.382059800664452
1630064,5,B00005N914,"I saw this movie on Hallmark a few months ago and just loved it. This is a story about a young couple who have their first child, a little girl who is born with severe disabilities. The husband, who is a fisherman by trade, can't handle it when she decides to have the baby, going back out to sea and leaving her alone. The husbands brother is a pediatrician (played by Campbell Scott) and he helps her care for the child. A romance develops between the two. As a person with a disability myself, I appreciated the high quality of life they provided for this little girl, allowing her to experience as much of life as possible. A great story about life and love and what is really important.",1249084800,,691,4.364341085271318

1630066,5,B00005N914,When I saw this film and read the reviews on it I just had to get it. It is a very moving story to it but what I think of the film is abosulty great but I thought when they found they were having a baby they were thrilled but when the husband found out the baby had something wrong with it he just got up and walked out on her and the baby and was not seen for a good few years. His brother had feeling for her for years but was the one caring for his niece along with her mother. Her daughter had made friends with a local girl who came over to her everyday. The husdand wans a spiteful pig he wanted his wife back but not his own daughter because he had said their daughter will not live much longer and wants her back. She told him if you want me back my daughter comes too. He could not accept it and walks off and never to be seen again. So his had finally got his chance and told his sister-in-law how he feels about her. So if you want a tear jerker film I guess you wanna see this film.,1241913600,2,994,3.8300970873786406

This movie was very moving and personal to me; we have a child who is disabled and I am so grateful that I married a man who can handle it.

This film shows various relationships portrayed in contrast to each other - fascinating study in human nature. The movie left me with a feeling of great love for my family and kind friends, an appreciation for what life gives each of us, and hope for those who need to make changes in their lives for the better.  I would HIGHLY recommend this film to everyone - you don't have to have a special needs child to get something from this movie.

1630074,4,B00005N914,"Follow the Stars Home, based on the book of the same name by Luanne Rice, is the story of Dianne (Kimberly Williams), a young woman in love with handsome sailor Mark McCune (Eric Close). The two begin a whirlwind courtship and marriage, but when Dianne discovers that the baby she is carrying will be born with severe neurological and physical disabilities, Mark walks out, leaving Dianne to raise Julia (Amanda and Caitlin Fein) alone, with only her mother to help her.

Mark's brother David (Campbell Scott), a doctor, offers to help Dianne raise Julia by providing medical checkups and support, and is worried about Dianne's health as sole caretaker. Meanwhile, Amy (Alexa Vega, Spy Kids) a girl from a troubled home, becomes a ""mother's helper"" to Dianne and her mother.

The rest of the film plays out as a more-or-less formulaic story, with the prerequisite dose of angst, guilt, hospital visits, abusive boyfriends, and self-pity thrown in, before the (anticlimactic) conclusion. However, Dianne fails to fall into the ""martyred mother of a handicapped child"" camp. I personally know several acquaintances who have handicapped children (one has a daughter with lissencephaly who is nonverbal, cannot sit up, crawl, or roll over, and has multiple seizures every day), and Dianne's steadfast devotion to Julia at the expense of her own health (and occasionally happiness) rings true. It takes a great deal of courage and love to be a lifetime caretaker of a severely handicapped child, and Kimberly Williams' portrayal was one of the best things about the movie.

Mark's role as the now-you-see-him, now-you-don't ex was less successful; his limited dialogue doesn't really allow much in the way of character development, and his subsequent appearances felt forced and unnecessary. David fares better as the loyal ""fifth wheel"" whose feelings for Dianne are largely ignored throughout most of the movie, yet he still gives his time to help Julia. Stage actress Blair Brown as Hannah, Dianne's mother, brought a degree of strength and wisdom that served as a direct counterpoint to Amy's drunken mother Tess (Roxanne Hart).

Follow the Stars Home is generally family-friendly, with the exception of Tess's physically abusive boyfriend (there is a scene involving animal cruelty as well as physical violence towards a child). However, the slow pace and adult plot will likely bore younger audiences.

Overall, this was a decent enough love story about mothers and daughters, second chances, and learning to trust that should appeal to fans of the original novel, and fits in well with the usual Hallmark Hall of Fame demographic.",1211673600,3,2632,5.183529411764706

1630080,5,B00005N914,"I've seen this movie several times.  It was at the most recent viewing that several thoughts came to mind.  I worked in a major medical center for several years and on occassion my clinic would see children who were severely disabled.  I would think what kind of life were the kids and their parents having - spending many days in the hospital.  I still don't know if I have an answer but the film has me thinking about it again.  I can empathize with the husband not being able to deal with the catastrophy (from his viewpoint) of a disabled child.  My ex-wife was diagnosed with a possible cancer (ultimately found to be not a cancer). When she was describing how she was feeling (very very scared) I didn't know what to say so ultimately just sat there like a dope and looked at her.  Not my best performance as a husband.  This movie brought that scene in my own life back very vividely.  Watching the mom's helper after she had been injured in a car accident apologizing for not being able to take care of Julia and Julia's mom and her alcoholic mother brought back other memories of my alcoholic father and how at the age of 12 I was trying to figure out ways to make him not drink.  I never did come up with a solution but seeing the torment in the child (who was apparently younger than me) brought the moments of over 40 years ago back to me.  So for me, this movie was thought provoking on many issues about my own life.  I'm not sure that this is a movie for everyone.  Some have said it has a good ending.  I'm not sure.  There is a pending death and you won't if Amy's mom says sober.  There are uncertainties in this movie just like in real life.  But at the conclusion you are at least hopeful that things will work out ok for everyone.  Ultimately this was a hard movie for me to watch but at the same time it was beneficial.  The acting was exceptional and the feelings and emotions they all conveyed were easy to understand and feel.  I recommend this movie highly but I'm not sure it is a movie that kids will easily understand.  Parents should stand by for lots of questions which have very hard answers.",1170115200,9,2124,4.299748110831234

1630087,5,B00005N914,"This movie spoke to me in so many ways.  It really showed how we can take something that the world looks down on such as a disability and use it for good.  I'm not saying having a disability is a positive thing: I have a disability and I know how difficult it can be to live with everyday.  But I also know from exoerience how it can be used to show people differences in people can really used to educate and bring people together.

The child with the severe disabilities, Julia, had a loving mother, grandmother and uncle (unfortunately, her father wanted to split because he thought her life was a waste, which is very sad for him because that would mean that he would really miss out on lot of love and happiness).  She had this loving family but needed a friend who was also a child.  Amy, on the other hand, needed a surrogate family because she wasn't being properly cared for at home and was being emotionally neglected there.  When Amy and Julia came together, they gave each other something special and precious that each of them needed.  For Julia, it was friendship.  For Amy, it was a second family that she could trust to give her the love and attention that she was being deprived of at home.

This all happened because David, knowing Amy was looking for a summer job, asked her if she ever thought about being a mother's helper, wanting Amy to help Julia's mother Diane with the care that Julia needed.  All of these people came together as a family because of Julia: she brought them together.  Amd I was so touched by that.

The whole cast is wonderful too. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  I also highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with being discouraged by a disability or feels uncomfortable around people with disabilities.  I also think that maybe it could be shown in schools to children who are at the age in which they can understnad what goes on in it (there is a couple of aggressive scenes in it and a couple scenes with violence in them.  The issues of alcoholism and domestic abuse are also seen in this movie so I recommend that younger children not see it but maybe middle school or high school kids.  Just an opinion.

Anyway, like I said, I think ANYONE can gain something valuable after watching this movie.
