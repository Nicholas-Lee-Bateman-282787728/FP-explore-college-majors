5045977,5,B00705R5K6,"I thoroughly enjoyed both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of this Jerry Bergonzi ""Creating a Jazz Vocabulary"" series.

I bought it from the Jazz Heaven website. There is a ton of information packed in here and to properly internalize all this information will take years of practice!

I HIGHLY recommend it to any players who are at an intermediate level and already know the basics of chord voicings, jazz terminology and a few tunes in their repertoire. Advanced players should still be able to get something from each dvd. Beginners would probably be too confused and should save this DVD for after learning the basics IMO :)

Jerry is an excellent educator and has methods for every topic he discusses.

I would buy both of the DVDs again. I've been playing piano for many years and still got a lot out of this series. Here is what they cover.

Vol. 1
Chord scales, Chord tones, Voice leading chord tones., how to practice, Approach notes, range, upper structures, shapes, anticipation.

Vol. 2
Sequences, Substitutions, Rhytmic motifs, more shapes and polyrhythms.",1373155200,6,1055,4.865921787709497
5045978,5,B00705R5K6,This video coupled with part 2 can keep any improvising musician busy for years...if not the rest of his/her life. Jerry brings solid musical concepts/ideas/techniques that can be applied to any instrument. Time to take off the training wheels and get serious!!!,1356652800,2,262,5.261904761904762
5045979,5,B00705R5K6,"This is a very good course for someone who is self-motivated and willing to take the time to really work on each of the exercises demonstrated. They make internalizing the scales look deceptively easy when a single one of these exercises could easily require a week or more of practicing to reach proficiency. On the other hand, if you're willing to stop the video after each exercise and really spend time working on it, it is definitely a solid means of reaching a higher level of fluency in improvising. Just don't expect miracles because, depending on your starting level, there could be several years worth of lessons and exercises in the two volumes.",1346025600,4,656,4.814159292035399
5045980,5,B00705R5K6,"If you are a student of jazz improvisation, no matter what your instrument, and you are overwhelmed by all the jazz instructional material ""out there,"" start here!!! Jerry gives very specific instructions about how and what to practice. The main advantage of a video format is that you can see/hear the material demonstrated as if you were attending a lesson/masterclass.  The demonstrations are excellent - very musical!
The material is presented in an extremely straight-forward manner and the video stays focused on the MOST IMPORTANT STUFF to practice. I teach woodwinds at Berklee College of Music and I use many of Jerry's ideas/methods with my own students. You can't go wrong purchasing Vol. 1 (and Vol. 2) in this series!!!

Jerry hit it out of the ball park with this one!

5045981,5,B00705R5K6,"Bergonzi's two lesson videos help you go beyond the level of just learning licks, by offering new perspectives on how to improvise. They give you a sense of freedom in improvisation. Must for intermediate and possibly even advanced players.",1343520000,,240,5.17948717948718
5045982,5,B00705R5K6,"I highly recommend this dvd. It contains a wealth of valuable information.
Mr. Bergonzi's exercises and explanations are pithy and easy to understand.
His relaxed, understated humor is a plus and... there's literally enough material to keep
you practicing and improving for years. Buy it!",1340582400,,288,5.4222222222222225
5045983,5,B00705R5K6,"I bought both of the Jerry Bergonzi JazzHeaven Videos. These are the best instructional jazz videos I have seen. They present real, appliable techniques and devices. Expand on them as they go through the chapter, which shows a great working method for continued growth. And really cover enough material to get this style together. Also the audio and video quality is excellent. For anyone serious about learning how to speak this language, this is a great resource.",1330387200,2,465,5.0519480519480515
5045984,5,B00705R5K6,The wonderful thing is this dvd is set up in lesson form. Jerry Bergonzi teaches another student which makes a good viewing. The emphasis in the dvd is HOW to learn and practice it. This demonstrates it so well! Truly Jazz Heaven!,1327104000,3,230,4.5
5045985,5,B00705R5K6,"After years of using Jerry Bergonzis books/methods for teaching
and myself i really have to say that this is the next step in the field
of teaching improvisational skills in a not person to person  situation.
Seeing this master demonstrating different aspects of the wide field
of improvisation is kicking you directelly in your practice room and is
very inspiring. For anybody who is serious about the art called ""Jazz"" it
is a must to check it out. Good quality, great demonstation and fun to
watch it. Thank you to jazzheaven.com for making this possible!",1327104000,4,558,4.873684210526315

8507564,5,B00705R5K6,"I have studied improvisational music for years.  In college, privately with teachers, and buying theory books/CDs.  All of them have been valuable, but I have never seen a video, where a teacher, Jerry Bergonzi, explains improvisation so clearly, with such simplicity.  Jerry's goal is to get you playing, right away, with the clearest path possible.  Many books and CDs out there are very helpful, but they tend to get lost in the technical theory language or the exercises are too complicated.  Each segment, Jerry explains the concept, the practice, and the application.  1 2 3.

Kudos to Jerry, Brian, and the Jazz Heaven team for such an incredible teaching breakthrough.",1443744000,,676,5.090909090909091
8507565,4,B00705R5K6,I purchased all three DVD's and found them a little advanced for my playing experience for right now...I'll review them again later.,1434412800,,132,5.045454545454546
8507566,5,B00705R5K6,"This DVD is a fantastic resource.  There's a lot of material out there on improvisation.  It can be a little overwhelming at times.  Many fall into the trap of having too much to think about and end up paralyzed with anxiety about all there is to practice and where to start.  I know it's happened to me.  I think it's safe to say though, that this DVD alone can keep me busy for a LONG time.

Jerry Bergonzi is a great instructor.  I've seen his improvisation book series, but they're hard to track down now.  This video has the extra benefit of being able to see Jerry demonstrate what he's explaining.  If you have his book series this would probably be a great companion to it, but if you don't you can get very far with just this.

One of the things I like about Jerry's style is he gives you a ton of information but he doesn't dictate what you should do with it.  That's not to say what he's teaching isn't clear, but he leaves it up to you to do what you have to in order to really make the stuff work..which is apply it to many tunes, do the stuff in all keys, and invent your own exercises based off what he gives you.  He shows you examples of this stuff on a tune either on the piano or with a student of his on sax and then he leaves it to you to work the stuff out so it gets into your playing.  This may be a turn off to those that need hand holding and step by step directions, but I like that he doesn't coddle the viewer along.  This leaves more time for content..and boy does he pack a lot of content into these 2 or so hours.  Maybe this is because Jerry is a top educator and he's used to teaching college music students that already know what they need to do as far as working stuff out in the woodshed.

Also know that this DVD is for any instrument.  Even though the demonstrations are all done on piano and/or sax, you can apply it to anything.  I play bass and I'm using the stuff I'm learning here to help me be more melodic when I get the rare solo opportunity.

The production quality of this DVD is also fantastic.  This isn't some instructional video shot on an old camera phone with grainy picture and audio.  Rather, this is top quality video and audio.

At first I thought this DVD was a little pricey, but after purchasing it I can definitely say it's worth every penny.  Unless your already a master improviser, this DVD will give you heaps of stuff to work on.  I'm definitely going to be picking up the other two volumes in the series despite the fact that I won't have even scratched the surface on the material here.

One other thing..I would recommend buying it off the company's site.  It's the same price and you get 24 hour access to the DVD after you purchase it...so you can watch it before your permanent copy arrives.  Maybe you get the same thing buying it off Amazon, but I don't know..I got it directly from the company.",1422403200,2,2871,4.201096892138939
8507567,5,B00705R5K6,"Dont let the vol 1 fool you, this gets right to your limit as a player and then expands you beyond very quickly. Play two chord tones (9th, 11th) over all chords to a standard and start hearing them! Its a challenge but fun to hear new ways. Then he plays with anticipating these chords tones in lots of new ways where you start to play the music rather than it playing you. I love JH production and this title rocks my saxophonic world.",1402790400,,437,4.214285714285714
8507568,5,B00705R5K6,"I completely agree with all of the other positive feedback given by the other reviewers of this video in this video series.
As a student of music what I really am looking for from a teacher is answers to the following questions. What do I practice and perhaps more importantly how do I practice it. This is perhaps the most important distinguishing characteristic of Jerry's teaching because he shows the student exactly what to do in order to practice the material which is teaching.

Jerry Bergonzi has a wealth of musical knowledge and he's showing you how to learn and practice without getting bogged down in too much theoretical explanation of the concepts.

I highly recommend this and all the other Bergonzi videos because of their content in the style of presentation.",1402185600,,776,4.871212121212121
8507569,5,B00705R5K6,"i got this video about a week ago.  Tons of great exercises and concepts.  It will take months, if not years, to internalize all the information that Jerry and Brian deliver.  The best part is that I can already feel a difference in my improvising.  These guys are great communicators they take what is complicated and make it simple.  Two thumbs up!",1402185600,,350,4.580645161290323
