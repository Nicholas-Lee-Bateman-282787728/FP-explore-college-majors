4294902,5,B0049TC8CQ,"I am watching the documentary on the History Channel as I write this, and I am just blown away by what I am watching!! My uncle and I are both historians of WWII, having traveled throughout Germany, Dachau Concentration Camp and the Ukraine, and I can say this is one of the best, if not THE best, compilations I have ever seen of actual footage shot by Germans at the time the events took place. My uncle and I have shelves of videos, DVDs, books, etc. delving in the rise of the Nazis, WWII and all related that would challenge the Smithsonian, and I thought I had seen everything there was to see... until now. I would love to know where The History Channel located all this footage as I am in awe of the level of footage that I have never-before seen. I would also like to emphasize the excellent narration by the History Channel. It is just so extremely well done I don't know what more I can say other than ""Thank you"" History Channel for reinventing the Nazi Documentary... this is some of the best, most informative footage compiled to date. What really sets it apart is the way in which the German people themselves narrate the footage via diary entries, letters, and so on. It is shocking to say the least. I can only wish that more of our schools would use this to inculcate our children in the ways of evil and subterfuge that arise during times of national difficulty and how easily people can be led astray by a provider of false hope. Amazing to see what people were willing to tolerate, and the level of personal freedom that was surrendered to the government, in exchange for the false hope of being taken care of by their government. This movie is a lesson for all nations and peoples who think they can get something for nothing... it all seemed so great until the lies began to fall apart, and then the German people ultimately paid the price for their actions. The lesson here is clear... be careful, and think very carefully of the consequences, before you begin to surrender your personal rights and freedoms away to growing government control and power... because you will ultimately pay a price if you are to ever get it back.",1295654400,85,2151,4.489795918367347
4294903,5,B0049TC8CQ,"My husband and I just finished viewing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Third-Reich-Rise-Fall/dp/B0049TC8CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Third Reich: Rise & Fall</a>.  We were extremely impressed by the narration and incredible footage, never seen before as extensively and as well documented. There were a number of places I was literally moved to tears. You see my Lithuanian born parents were refugees of that horrible war fleeing the Soviet occupation for safety in displaced persons camps located in the American occupation zone of post war Germany. My paternal grandfather had already met his death as a political prisoner of the Nazis in a concentration camp in Stutthof, Poland. (The last camp to be liberated by the Allies on May 9, 1945, there were more than 85,000 victims who died in this camp and out of as many as 110,000 people deported there.) Seeing this film really brought it home to me just how much my own people had to suffer as a result of what was happening in Europe at that time.

I have to say though that as horrible as Hitler was to even his own people let alone those in the lands that he occupied, Stalin was far worse. All you have to do is to read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Defeat-in-the-East/dp/0553134698/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Defeat in the East</a>&nbsp;to find out just how horribly Soviet animals (Russian soldiers) treated not only German but Polish, Ukranian, Lithuanian and civilian women of many other nationalities in their march westward. Girls as young as eight or elderly women as old as 80 were gang raped many times to death. Boys and young men were hung and nailed to barn doors, old men walking with two canes run over by Russian tanks. Why is not MORE written out these Soviet BEASTS?  This films touching on the plight of women in a newly Soviet occupied Berlin reminded me just how lucky my own family had been being able to escape the Berlin area just three months before it fell in April 1945.

If there is one fault with this film I believe it is that it blames the German people themselves too much for what happened in Nazi Germany. I sincerely believe that there were many who did not know how extensive the murders were in the concentration camps. Also the film does not at all speak of the many Germans who risked their own lives by hiding Jews in their homes and of those daring enough to participate in what Americans had trouble believing existed --the German resistance itself. For a good example of this I would suggest the reader delve into the outstanding book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bodyguard-of-Lies-The-Extraordinary-True-Story-Behind-D-Day/dp/1599213834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day</a>

Otherwise I would strongly recommend this film to the serious student of history. I have already preordered my copy of it.",1295654400,7,2996,5.476190476190476
4294904,5,B0049TC8CQ,"As a history teacher I am faced with the arduous task of finding historical movies and documentaries that will keep the attention of 130 students. With much of today's youth being exposed to war movies and violent video games at an early age, many of them feel like they have ""seen it all"". By seen it all, I mean movies like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, etc. Not to knock any of those movies (as they are excellent) but they do not create the same atmosphere that the ""Third Reich"" does. I showed this entire documentary to an Honors U.S. History class and the entire class was floored.

As mentioned before, many of these kids think war is ""no big deal"" but after seeing this film, their opinions quickly changed and it actually resulted in an extremely thoughtful and creative discussion. Whether you are a teacher, a historian, or just looking for something good to watch, ""Third Reich"" will keep you at the edge of your seat. The homemade footage, the pictures, and the historical narrative are nothing short of amazing. Highly recommended.",1295308800,53,1058,4.718918918918919
4294905,5,B0049TC8CQ,"The documentary began with ""this is not a story about Hitler's rise to power, but why the German people gave it to him."" I thought it would be a story that offered excuses to vindicate the role of the German people. It is the complete opposite. I've seen many shows about the Holocaust but this account trumps them all. I was especically moved when in ""The Fall"" the allied forces had the German people see what the Nazis did in the camps. For some the content may not be novel but the approach of explaining the events as ""if you were a German..."" and ""if you were Jewish..."" certainly is. Kudos. I am going to pre-order this. The opportunity is there to view it on the History Channel before purchasing.

I would even appreciate a documentary of this calibre about slavery: ""if you were a slave..."" ""if you were the captain of a slave ship..."" ""if you were a slave owner"" and even ""if you were a descendant of a slave...""",1293667200,17,923,4.39766081871345
4294906,5,B0049TC8CQ,"I watched the History Channel's presentation of ""Third Reich: Rise & Fall"" and found it very interesting. There have been many films and books dealing with the Third Reich but this film told it from the German citizen's perspective. And, while many books and films deal with how Hitler managed to rise to power, this two-part film explains why he was able to do it. The film is shown in both black and white and color and includes home movies taken by German citizens. It held my interest throughout it's entirety and even my husband, who is not really interested in that type of programing, watched it with me. I highly recommend it!",1292630400,14,634,4.619469026548672
4294907,5,B0049TC8CQ,"As a Historian I will add this to my personal collection of WWII Documentaries.  I was impressed by the use of home movies shot by families that lived in Germany during the rise of the Nazi Party leading to WWII. The series effectively tied the experiences of the German citizenry in with how Hitler first came to power and then in leading the nation to war. The impact of Hitler's rise to power and how the Nazi Party ran the government was evolutionary rather than revolutionary for most Germans. We know how the Nazis marginalized the Jews before finally removing them from society. They along with the other ""undesirables"" were the focus of propaganda efforts to convince the German people that it was important to remove these people from society. The series shows how popular Hitler became as he led Germany out of the Great Depression and brought previously unattainable luxuries to the working class. Hitler and the Nazis restored German pride after the humiliation of the Versailles Treaty and other sanctions by the Allies after WWI. This series shows how happy Germans were as Hitler made one foreign policy triumph after another gaining new territory for the Reich up until the attack on Poland finally triggered WWII. Hitler was careful to keep domestic goods in production so the German people wouldn't have to sacrifice for the war effort which ironically led to Germany being the last nation to go to a full-time war economy. Hitler was fearful that the German people were too soft to bear the full measure of a war economy. So at the start of the war the German people were mostly unaffected by the war except for those men who went off to fight. The first episode of this series ends with Germany ascendant and flush with success in battle while at home most Germans were also doing well except for the Jews who were no longer a part of the Deutsches Volk.

The second part of this documentary (The Fall) starts with Nazi Germany realizing the vision of Hitler to conquer Europe for Lebensraum for the Deutsches Volk while coming to the conclusion on Die Endl&ouml;sung sealing the fate of the Jews and other undesirables.  This episode continues with the use of civilian home movies as well as using the movies shot by soldiers.  This can be very disturbing as the atrocities committed on the Eastern Front are difficult to watch even for an experienced Historian like myself.  This episode brings home the visceral impact of just how mundane the scene appeared to be as German soldiers herded Jews and other ""enemies"" into ditches and shot them en masse.  The fall of the Third Reich was an excruciating process that involved a lot of suffering and death.  The videos used by this episode illustrate the banality of evil as life went on as usual for those not fighting on the front.  The Allied bombing did impact German cities and the civilian population.  It is strange to see how humans struggle to continue their daily lives in the midst of rubble.  After the Western Allies invaded Europe via Normandy the Americans took movies of what they saw as they advanced into Germany.  They shot movies of the concentration camps they liberated bearing witness to the ugly reality of Die Endl&ouml;sung.  I believe it is the use of this excellent archive of movies shot by German civilians as well as Allied soldiers brings an emotional impact to this series that is fresh especially for those who have viewed the plethora of documentaries and films on this subject.  The personal, individual and family perspective of this history is important to understand the immensity of this conflict on those who lived under Hitler and the Third Reich.  This episode ends with the terrible repercussions experienced by the German people for the crimes of Hitler and the Nazis.  The Soviets raped, pillaged and murdered on a scale that boggles the mind after they defeated the German Army.  Millions of Germans fell under the control of the Soviet Union as Stalin set up a Communist East Germany.  Western Germany was more fortunate but it took time for them to recover from the devastation of the war.  Germany did not fully recover from the effects of the Third Reich until the reunification after the Fall of the Soviet Union.  You cannot view this documentary and ever see the impact of the rise and fall of Nazi Germany in abstract and dispassionate terms ever again.  My only real criticism of this series is that it was too short.  I wonder what was left out due to time constraints as this series could easily have been twice as long and still been just as riveting and engrossing.  I am hopeful that this DVD set will include extras and commentary.",1292630400,491,4662,4.758064516129032
4294908,5,B0049TC8CQ,"After watching the 2 part series on the History Channel I was so impressed that I've been searching the internet to purchase this (of course, it's here but pre-release).  Well, the presentation of this docu was very unique and something I haven't seen in WWII docu's before.  It's difficult for me to explain but between the narritive and the images, it was a refreshing new view on something that I thought was covered many times.  I learned much more than I expected- especially because this was offered as a view from the German people.  I highly recommend this title.

As a part German, with a little bit of Jewish (thank you, Ancestry DNA), I was particularly interested.  Having always wondered how an entire people could allow themselves to become subjugated to a maniac, I got a better idea from this two part documentary.  Some of the film quality is poor, due to it being home movies, both from civilians and soldiers, but it's a real eye-opener for anyone who loves history.  There was a lot of information I hadn't encountered before, and I was delighted to get a better insight from it.  Highly recommend this set.",1516752000,4,699,4.604838709677419

""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"" ""Berlin Diary,"" ""The First and the Last,"" ""The German Raider Atlantis,"" etc. There were many approaches in the books, but nothing like this DVD.  The old home films presented in the DVD gave a new view of how upscale Germans not raised on socialism but were, nevertheless, patriotic Germans were sometimes treated by the Nazi system.

This was one of the best documentaries on the effects of Nazism on not just the countries they took over, but on the German people themselves.

It was a great idea to utilize home movies, as well as the letters and diaries of the Germans themselves-especially those who supported Hitler in the beginning, as they often ended up in a worse situation than they had been in before he came to power.

A very important fact explained in this movie is that the German people had no choice but to cooperate with Hitler's agenda... Or, die!  If nothing else, this film does convey the fact that the vast majority of the German people were ""victims"" trapped in their circumstances and making every effort to just survive themselves. I felt that this film could have provided more footage and finished with the reclamation of Germany by the decent people of Germany.

I hope another such film is produced which includes footage of a rebuilt Germany after World War II during reconstruction and through the years until the present. A more optimistic and positive outcome should be expressed in the film at the end, in my opinion. We all know the horrors of World War II, But we need to know that recovery was possible although I understand Germany was not completely recovered until well into the 1980s.  I thank the producers and contributors to this insightful film which provides another viewpoint which is a very important understanding of the circumstances of the German people under Hitler's rule.

Its about the German people during that period, and they say so at the very beginning. So right off the bat I was disappointed. But what really got on my nerves was the MTV style in which this documentary is made. They used a fake old timey newsreel effect and quick transitions between cuts that remind me of music videos, or a David Fincher movie. There's ominous music throughout, and the narrator is overly dramatic, making what should otherwise be a serious documentary into a cartoonish joke. They go out of the way create an evil atmosphere and it just comes off over the top. We get it, Nazis are bad. Also, some of the footage is just home videos that don't really have anything to do with, well, anything. Some home videos make sense, others dont. They make them tie into the narrative, but it comes off contrived. The good? There is footage I've never seen, showing what it was like during the Third Reich, and some diary passages that were pretty interesting.

Overall, nothing here that's not better elsewhere. I suggest watching The World At War, or reading The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich by William Shirer.",1450828800,4,1277,4.576419213973799

4295054,1,B0049TC8CQ,"This carefully Politically Sanitized Propaganda piece could have been made by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, who pioneered much of the manipulation techniques used by the alleged 'History Channel' to push their Political Agenda inside a pseudo-documentary, thus giving their partisan viewpoints a victory through Censorship of Politically Un-Good Facts from the program.

I watched this story on the 'History Channel' (before cancelling) over many years - and have seen the 'evolution' of the story of how the Homo-Nazi Reich came to power repeatedly manipulated to sanitize and Censor the Central Character of Party Founder (and hitler's mentor / boyfriend) Ernst Rohm.

Rohm led the Homosex-Terrorist 'SA' Storm Troopers in beating Germany in to submission, as well as taking over the 'hitler youth' after the boy scouts had been destroyed - at least until Rohm and his cadre's Ephebophile Sex Abuse of Adolescent Boys (including getting them drunk / drugged, raped and blackmail pictures for the families) became too much of a scandal even for the propaganda minister to cover up.

There are a few Factually Accurate books out there on this (The Pink Swastika amongst others) and even a sanitized biography of Ernst Rohm (Reviewed on Amazon) that barely touches the shocking electric Third Rail of nazism - that it was founded and led by Homosex Ephebophiles and the story behind the blood purge of the ""Night of the Long Knives"" (leading to Rohms Assassination in prison) is so Politically Un-Good that there is no way it can be properly re-told without violating the Political Agendas of the Owners of the History Channel.
 (*Owned by A+E Networks, a joint venture between the Hearst Corporation and the DisneyABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company.)

For insight in to the Background Deliberately Censored from this put up piece, I suggest the uber-leftist Huff-Poo story by Johan Hari, who actually discusses the missing 'History' that the 'history channel' has decided is to Un-Good to include.

BTW - Hitler's alleged 'heterosexual mistress - eval braun' was what is known as a 'Beard', recruited by the propaganda minister to make Hitler appear heterosexual himself - after he had his Boyfriend Rohm Killed.

The fall of France was dealt with in a single line of narrative. NOT that I was looking to see the fall of France: I wanted to see something of the fall of Germany.
Throughout we were treated to home movies dancing out of focus, of smiling 'Maedchen', and at least FIVE MINUTES of a cat playing on a ladder. Most of the images were generic, having nothing to do with the continuing narrative. At one point the narrative spoke about the bombing of England ~ so the film showed a bunch of Messerschmitt fighters zooming past.

After once or twice it was okay but through two DVD's it became quite aggravating. It was not part of the original actual film clips but was added as it was edited. It wasn't for that aggravation I would have given it five stars. The first DVD talks one from the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party to 1939 and the second DVD takes it from 1939 and what was the fall of the Third Reich. There was some good Russian combat film that I had not seen before as well as some Nazi news reels that is not often seen. This is a good review of how Hitler came to power and shows how it only takes a few people to form a dictatorship. The good people stand by before it is too late. One thing that stands out is the enormous use of Nazi flags in the German cities and whatever cities they conquered. Who ever had cornered the flag market must have become very rich. The collection of films also show the amount of propaganda  that was used to manipulate the people, the massive assemblies of troops before the war started and the brutality of their actions against the Jews. It illustrates that ""Freedom is  Not Free,"" and that each generation must be vigilant to not fall for charismatic speakers, manipulation of the media and propaganda.",1432944000,2,1518,4.249134948096886

4295141,5,B0049TC8CQ,An excellent two part documentary on Nazi Germany and the war. The first part deals with the rise of Hitler and how they gained control of Germany and started the war.  It uses old film footage from newsreels and other sources.  The second part deals with the War and the fall of the Nazi government. It is well narrated and edited and follows the history of the war.  I enjoyed the documentary purchased it after seeing one part on TV.  It is very informative and shows rare glimpses of Germany  before and during the War.  I recommend it.,1429920000,,540,4.459183673469388

It's quite a shocking documentary with a fascinating German perspective. Boys to the age of 13 ""volunteered"" to fight in the last years because being caught hiding meant you would be hanged as an example. In the early years, if you opposed the 3rd Reich you were killed. It's a powerful warning for what can happen when the government is given too much power.

(lol) Look up ' The world wars ' , ' WWII from space ', or ' Nazis- Evolution of Evil ' all available from Amazon. A true example of you get what you pay for. ' WWII from space' costs more, as do the others. Alec Baldwin narrated that one, the others are AMAZING. I would actually recommend buying these three in Blu-ray 1080 high-def.

Think it's kind of funny that in 1939 so many volunteers had signed up to the whermacht not the SS as did IRA volunteers sign up after Bloody Sunday 1972.

4295184,5,B0049TC8CQ,"After watching yet another WW2 release in recent years, my interest in the era was once again peaked as I set out to add to my collection of WW2 history... I recall when I actually had TV, seeing ""The Third Reich Rise & Fall"" always on History channel or H2 (you know, the few hours in the week when they actually air history-related material)...

My fear was, was that this program wouldn't at all quench my thirst for WW2 history exactly... I don't know why, because at the center of WW2 IS the Third Reich, and this program does a great job of truly explaining what's so interesting about WW2: that unlike WW1, the cause is so plain to see.

If you want to see how Germany slipped into madness, as the narrator states at the beginning, ""This isn't a documentary of how Hitler took over Germany, it's a documentary of how Germany allowed Hitler to lead,"" (or something like that). From the fiery speeches that Hitler gave (that sound very similar to a leader today in our world), to the unbelievable laws to blatantly against Jews, to snippets of propaganda that Germany did... these two documentaries stand out in History's documentaries. History Channel took a cue from Ken Burns, and used no reenactments, and had voiceovers from personal journals and diaries at the time.

The devil is patient and waits until we have become complacent.  We are taking our comforts and securities for granted- DON'T!  Man desires power.  Our government is in the business of navigating around the Constitution.  Watch out when all of our Founding Documents become things of the past!

Quote, ""This is not a film about how HItler seized power, its a film about how the German people gave it to him"".  The success of this film is the understanding the viewer takes away at the end on how all the cards fell into place that allowed a mad man like this took Germany to total destruction.

4295232,5,B0049TC8CQ,"The first thing people will think when looking at this title is that it is another typical war documentary.  It is not.  I first saw this on the History Channel and felt compelled to purchase it.  The film documents how the Nazi's were able to rise to power in 1930's Germany and most of the footage is from the German ""home front"".  For anyone who wonders how Hitler was able to accomplish what he did, this chilling documentary shows how he and his ilk moved in small steps to finally control through fear the German people.  Very informative, and something to make everyone understand how important limited government is.

There are some extremely graphic films of the war, and much more so of the concentration camps.  Make no mistake, this can be very unsettling, but at the same time I feel it is important to have an untainted view of history.  I cannot recommend this enough and would consider it suitable for anyone over 13 years old.",1389398400,,943,4.604790419161676

The editing coupled with the narration, the home movies, letters, it's focus on the ordinary citizen is what makes this riveting, and adds to its' menace.

Which parts stood out: The end of the first part (I think) shows a young girl playing leapfrog over and over run backwards and forwards, the narration reminding us of the coming storm, and the immediate cut towards men getting ready to slaughter a pig. D:

At the fair, when the announcement is made Germany is at war again, and the girl petting the horse.

Ot: I'm sick of the Teabaggers, and right wing media (Glenn Beck I'm looking at you!)comparing President Obama and everything they disagree with Hitler Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust.  It trivializes what happened, shows they have no f***ing idea about history, and if Obama *was* like Hitler, their a**es would be in a concentration camp.

4295258,5,B0049TC8CQ,"I'am most certainly glad that there is so much information available  where it concerns This particular place and time in history. The referred to ""this particular place and time in history"" is as it pertains to both The Rising of Germanys Third Reich and equally as difficult The Fall of  Germanys Third Reich. To be certain this is not many upon many DVD's,there are but 2 DVD's. One section of the presentation called the ""Rise of The Third Reich"" with the other DVD titled The Fall of The Third Reich. This is an interesting presentation that at no time during the viewing did I wish not to be viewing this particular product. I watched with interest and indeed this particular mention is mentioned as this is an interesting 2 DVD presentation. There is presented a very sober quality that attempts to place the entire time period in a very  sober light. While some where not perhaps aware a show piece of performance took center stage when the Nazi German Government came to power. It was something that it would pay to be sober and not stand up and say ""Bravo"" or perhaps ""Heil Hitler"".This section had a quality of almost impressing the viewer beyond merely explanation. The Propaganda film ""Triumph of The Will"" is mentioned and many such references are equally as interesting. This is not to be pooh poohed, this is excellent film making and as interesting as would be ""Triumph of the Will"".It is only mentioned that as was stated above keep the lid on it because that too can happen. The Liner notes to this particular offer states ""histories most dangerously successful totalitarian government"".The first DVD will impress you. Disc one:The Rise. Disc Two:The Fall is not unlike the first however The Rise is as stated kept in check and would not look  much different than the Fall(Disc Two).This is useful and sober. There is employed many items that are both different and worth watching. One such item involves the controversy that the Sudentenland caused. In this particular instance Adolf Hitler over loudspeakers in a paticular community speaks in a virtual shout to inform the German people that war with Chekoslovakia is imminent. There are Homemade motion pictures,personal stories of unmistakable suffering and loss so great that when The Red Army  approaches Berlin they are told by Joseph Stalin(?) ""do not count the hours,do not count the days,count the number of germans you will kill,kill the German,Kill the German"". This is why we need to know this, I can not forget because this is why we are here. There are gaps most certainly in the telling of this history however it is the story telling ability that is worth the viewing pleasure of you the reader of this opinion. The Rise of Nazi Germany  restored Germanys pride with The Fall providing such defeat that ""Eternal Shame"" was an expressed opinion. A capable presentation worth 180 minutes. There is a Russian Soldier's film and then there is American forces rolling up on a yet to be discovered concentration camp. A story is told of the many German Women who were raped by the approaching Red Army. Then there were the untold stories of the extreme fear that gripped the very psyche of the German Women with the approach of the Red Army. That fear was so great that there were high percentages of German women who in the grip of such fear decided to commit suicide,and commit suicide they did. Entire communities are on record of having jumped to there death as the Red Army approached. There are speeches up to the very last speech made by Adolf Hitler in April,1945. Sober,this presentation may be however this still is such a story that it will grip you. This is a story that I'am glad there is so much attention being paid to this particular time in history.",1377302400,2,3746,4.7642526964560865

4295297,3,B0049TC8CQ,"The best thing about this DVD is the footage.  There's so much of it, some of which has never been shown on TV and is now currently banned in Germany.  Also interesting are quotes from articles and diaries/journals of Germans during this time and outsiders.  There is also some great insights on Hitler's deception.  However, there are some informational deficiencies.

The first disc covers the aftermath of World War I and is impact on Germany.  Then it introduces Hitler and retells his political rise.  It doesn't go into enough detail on his attempted revolution and him being sentenced to prison.  It also doesn't make clear that no one really took Hitler seriously until the Stock Market crash in the US in 1929 and the Great Depression that was felt in Europe.

There's no discussion of Hitler's plans for conquest until the last 10 minutes of the first disc, 'Rise of the Third Reich'.  When it is discussed, it jumps right to Hitler's absorption of Czechoslovakia.  There's no mention of the Sudetenland, the infamous showdown with Mussolini of Italy and Chamberlain of UK over it.  The analysis of the Anschluss of Austria is also lacking.  Also disappointing there's no mention of Hitler's alliance with Mussolini of Fascist Italy, and his assistance to Francisco Franco in Spain, which proved critical to his belief that democracies were weak.  The first disc is great for how Hitler and the Nazi party came to power in Germany, and what life was like for Germans both Jews/non-Jews under the Third Reich.  There is some footage of the Olympics during this time, and the peaceful image Hitler sought to portray to the world.  Bu if you want information on Nazi Germany's attempted conquest of Europe and the beginning of World War II, look elsewhere.

Second, there's no discussion on how Hitler revived the German economy.  A fact which I'd think is pretty important considering the first disc premises itself on how the German people allowed Hitler's rise.  The second disc opens with a short discussion on the German economic miracle of 1938 but quickly moves to German Jews leaving to the UK and the US.  Then the film discusses how Hitler led Germans into war.  There's some great rare war footage of the invasions of France, Poland etc.

Overall this film is great for people with curious about life in Nazi Germany--how the Nazis used propaganda films to justify everything Hitler did.  But those wanting to learn about the politics of it, and the events that led to World War II should look elsewhere.",1358294400,3,2522,4.85480093676815

4295309,5,B0049TC8CQ,"I've tried to analyze my deep satisfaction with the documentary - maybe, it's born by purely personal revengeful emotions (I'm the only child in my family to survive 3-years of my native Leningrad's Nazi blockade, where two my elder sisters died of hunger)? But no: the film's message is much more universal, I think. It shows that thoughtless support of any Beloved Leaders never remains unpunished, with punishment not limited to those in power only: their happy supporters are always ""rewarded"" with the longest and the cruelest sufferings. What was an easy momentary death of Hitler in comparison with dreadful fates of his multi-million enthusiastic zombies, both adult and young, - in flame and destruction of carpet-bombed German cities, in rape-rob-kill orgy of the Soviet offensive, in meager years of after-war poverty? Nothing, but absolutely nothing! I've seen the same kind of Eternal Justice in the Russian documentaries about as thoughtless and as enthusiastic ""innocent"" supporters of Stalin - their later fate in labor camps, in famished villages and in bleak urban subsistence was as horrible, as was the Nazi Germany's one. I am sure that some day in future someone will make no less powerful documentary about the real price of supporting Obama for the great majority of his voters... This most expressive DVD makes me assume that the modern trend to exclude the innocent civil population from any wars with Islamic warlords would be probably counter-productive both in the military and in the historic sense: such a trend guarantees just the strengthening of the population's belief that everything goes the usual Islamic way (to tell nothing about ever-growing personnel losses from exactly these ""innocent civilians"")...  I may be wrong, of course, but anyway my feeling of gratitude for one more convincing lesson about ""At any key crossroads use your brains, nor your feelings - you will not be able to escape the inevitable consequences of your choice"" is sincere: thanks a lot!

Great documentary. You will feel like you are actually in that era of the rise and fall of the Nazi regime. And also you will come across many footage of WW II which were not available before.",1350777600,,354,6.888888888888889
4295311,5,B0049TC8CQ,"""This is not a story of how Hitler seized power, is the story of how and why german people gave it to him..."" this is how this amazing documentary starts using original and never seen before home films, made by the germans living in the Third Reich.

The defeat of Germany in WWI left a country with no jobs, no money, no food and no hope. Germany was literally in the abyss and its people were looking for a savior, ""a man to guide the Fatherland"". With an economic and political crisis, Hitler made his first move to gain the trust and took advantage of the chaothic situation Germany was into by creating a whole cult around himself, beyond Germany was the faith and loyalty to the fuhrer.

The facts that happened in ""The Rise"" shows how germans were manipulated by Hitler to let him take an absolut power and taking an oath of blind obedience to him. The children weren't an exception of it, they were recruited by the ""Hitler Youth"" where they were taught to fight, to struggle, but beyond that, to show no mercy or compassion at all. The girls, in the other hand, had the duty to bring new germans to the world, as a compromise of motherhood with Germany.

""The Fall"" shows the unavoidable consequences of the violence and the lust for power of Adolf Hitler. The incitation of hate against the Jews, using them as a scape goat, by blaming them for the defeat of Germany in WWI (without consider the jews who fought and died for the same country in that war), by acussing them for the political and economical crisis. And when the people is so scared and confused, they are not looking for solutions, but someone to blame. Hitler gave them a name and a face. The jews lost their identity, their belongings and assets, and finally, their lives.
The failed invasion to Russia gave as a result for The Third Reich to have enemies in the east and the west, both getting closer everyday and finally, the aftermath of the war that, at last, stroke against the germans.

Berlin had no food, no water, no electricity. The nazi army called for kids and old people to fight for their country and their leader when the inminent defeat was already there. No one could believe in final victory anymore. Massive suicides happened as result of it, and the worst had not already happened.

The discover of the nazi atrocities against the Jews, political prisoners, homosexuals, Jehova's witnesses, and other ""enemies of the State"" brought nothing but shame and guilt for the germans. It's sad to find out that ""the german dream"" and the belief that this destroyed nation could rebirth ended such as a cathastroph. Hitler left Germany worst than when he found it, because if you want to build a nation by the destruction of others, that castle made of sand, sooner or later will fall deeper that it was before.",1349654400,,2799,4.578842315369261
4295312,5,B0049TC8CQ,This is a great movie on the cause and how National Socialists came to power in Germany.  This is a movie through home movies of the time from people in Germany.

4295313,5,B0049TC8CQ,"This is a documentary about how the German people were affected by the Third Reich.  The makers of this 3-hour documentary did an excellent job at covering so broad a topic.  They made use of diaries, letters, home movies, other clips, and narration to reconstruct life for Germans in the Third Reich, to give you an understanding of how they were acceptant of Nazism.  It is very effective at helping you see how free societies fall to tyranny, so that we don't let it happen again.  Germany didn't have a successful experiment with democracy under the Weimar Republic, and the communists were so maligned by the Nazis that Germans wanted to have the group they thought was less extreme, less violent, and less foreign-influenced, the Nazis.  People accepted Nazism in the beginning because it gave them a better economy, and propaganda kept them acceptant after that.  Once Hitler became chancellor, it was too late to stop him by legal means, because the Reichstag fire--probably a false flag attack he blamed on the communists, intended to give him more power--scared people into giving him dictatorial powers, and his Nazi party very quickly took over the legislature.  Germany had a strong tradition of military pride, so it wasn't scary to them to have a dictator, and they didn't care about having the most attractive candidate like our Hollywood-image culture.  Hitler enthralled audiences with his skill at making sure people didn't get JUST a message of hate toward foreigners (especially Jews), but a positive message of German pride as well.  The documentary also tells of how Hitler Youth learned combat skills at camps and grew frighteningly insubordinate toward their parents.

This worthwhile 2-disc series explores personal stories and reactions to many important events.  It is not a thorough history of all the events, but looks at important cultural changes which occurred each year.  You'll be a wiser person after watching this.",1349222400,,1951,5.10062893081761

4295322,2,B0049TC8CQ,"I quite was sorry to see the History Channel has met new lows in typical cheap American Dramatization style (Hollywood style?) in this particular ""documentary"".  Right from the beginning stark depictions of gory yet alive injured Germans lie rotting in the city street dirty and uncared for and seemingly ignored by other passers by in what the film details as post war Germany.  Throughout the film old family films (most every family has) is played in between common footage without much new material.  No new information.  I would suggest bypassing this one and try ealier History Channel or Learning Channel documentaries or perhaps BBC (always wonderful and solid).  This is a juvenile effort at best.  A most unworthy effort and even disrispectful effort given to a most solemn event such as WWII.  History Channel I would suggest thoroughly examining present day visual documentaries currently produced.  Much of it is dramatic trash not fit for library or book shelf but best proscribed to the common trash bin.

I think Amazon is wonderful and recommend their services hands down for all their media services for purchase and subscribe to many myself.  With that said utube has some wonderful solid documentaries produced by British and even German (yes, wonderful solid stuff) english speaking films.  There was also a wonderful Canadian mini series produced in the early 2000's (The Rise of Evil)that is not too bad an effort at all.  There are some good efforts from Americans particularly in older more well documented series.

For reading I would suggest John Tolland who wrote a most solid, informative account of this most tragic time (several books) in human history.  He mentioned his purpose in writing in the forward of one of his WWII books that he wanted to report events in the ""objectivity of time""  after the emotional dust had settled.  Now this author I can appreciate.

Drama is great but History Channel please take your drama kings and queens elsewhere and give WWII the dignity it this tragedy it deserves in future portrayals.",1337644800,6,2058,5.023598820058997

4295324,4,B0049TC8CQ,"I have to admit that ""The Third Reich: Rise and Fall"" took me by surprise when I watched it on the History Channel yesterday.  I'd returned from a two-day trip to see how my aged, saintly parents were doing in Kanab (Utah), I was channel surfing and hit this documentary just as it started.  I know a fair bit about WWII in general and a good bit about the Nazis so I wasn't expecting anything earth shattering from this show.  However, as I watched it quickly struck me that this documentary had a different tone, a unusual feel to it, it was more striking than most. The more I watched, the more it drew me in.  The creators used diary, first person stories, and amateur film that were fresh, not the usual stock files and archive footage.  By the end of the first hour I had my laptop up and I was ordering the DVD's.  If you like to buy serious documentaries, this is a must have.
Be aware if you have not seen this documentary, it's four hours long, two two-hour segments, so be prepared to invest some time, however, you won't be disappointed. You already know the story and it's ending, but you'll like how this film gets you there.",1335657600,,1139,4.349056603773585
4295325,2,B0049TC8CQ,"This documentary is terrible!  I'm only about halfway through and already it leaves out basic facts. Why would they leave out information?  To ""dumb it down"" for people?  Or some other agenda?  For example, it doesn't explain how Hitler was able to gain control of the press after the Reichstag fire, and how the communist party members got arrested.  Turns out, according to Wikipedia, ""The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and found Marinus van der Lubbe. Van der Lubbe, council communist and unemployed bricklayer, who had recently arrived in Germany, ostensibly to carry out political activities. The fire was used as evidence by the Nazis that the Communists were beginning a plot against the German government. Van der Lubbe and four Communist leaders were subsequently arrested. Adolf Hitler, who had been sworn in as Chancellor of Germany four weeks before, on 30 January, urged President Paul von Hindenburg to pass an emergency decree to counter the ""ruthless confrontation of the Communist Party of Germany"".[2] With civil liberties suspended, the government instituted mass arrests of Communists, including all of the Communist parliamentary delegates. With them gone and their seats empty, the Nazis went from being a plurality party to the majority; subsequent elections confirmed this position and thus allowed Hitler to consolidate his power.""  Then I'm like, what about Hindenburg, wasn't he representing the Communist party at the time (since they were a majority before the fire).  So I found out basically that he was not Communist, but he was very old, easily influenced by Hitler, and that he DIED the following year ... "". In February, he issued the Reichstag Fire Decree which suspended various civil liberties, and in March he signed the Enabling Act, in which the parliament gave Hitler's administration legislative powers. Hindenburg died the following year, after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and, as ""Fhrer und Reichskanzler"", made himself head of state.""  But the documentary doesn't mention how any of this came to pass. It's just like, okay now the Nazis are in charge and everybody is happy about it! No mention of any Germans that might have opposed Hitler at that time. Then they talk about Hitler torturing to death people who don't agree with him, and imply that the German people know about this ... I don't believe that at all.  As far as I can tell,up to 1933, Germans have no reason to suspect Hitler's true nature.  Arghhhh.  What a crappy documentary.  I expect better from the History Channel, but I DON'T KNOW WHY I WOULD, considering what other crap passes for history (ancient aliens????).",1335571200,14,2682,5.112128146453089

4295327,4,B0049TC8CQ,"With it's new ""never before seen"" footage, this is one of the most compelling Third Reich documentaries I have ever seen.

Instead of the usual official footage that has been used for year, this documentary is made more powerful by new footage from private collections, recently released archives and more .......... giving a much closer and personal perspective of this ear in history.

Why only 4 stars ?

To add dramatic effect, the producers often use choppy editing and cut scenes too short and fast.
They also use fake digital melting film tricks and other jerky special effects to add a sense of mental unrest.

Also, in between almost every scene where a new title appears they use the ""distressed film"" video effect that causes the words to jump erratically on the screen like some cheap horror movie.
This happens about once every 30-60  seconds for the full 4 hours which gets annoying and distracting.

The subject matter is heavy enough, it does not need digital video effect gimmicks to try and make it seem more eerie ...  this kind of video trickery only risks adding a cheesy feel to what should be a very serious treatment.

If you can overlook this abuse and over use of video effect gimmicks, this is a very compelling documentary about the rise and fall of Hitler ...... told from a SLIGHTLY different perspective.",1334880000,20,1335,4.773913043478261
4295328,5,B0049TC8CQ,"A number of other reviewers object that there's not much new here and/or that they don't care for the style of the presentation, the history is insufficiently detailed, or that some of the footage isn't totally relevant to the narration.

All justifiable criticisms. However, the substantial content of this four-part series is absolutely on the mark.  Of course it doesn't go deeply into details: it's only a few hours long!

I'll say this much: crucially, the information is true and absorbing. If some of us know the  facts already, there are millions of kids who do not have a clue and need to be told. History Channel's ""The Third Reich"" will tell them the essentials of Hitler's Evil Empire in a gripping and memorable fashion.  Obviously there is more to tell.

I recommend ""The Third Reich,"" particularly for high-school and freshman college use as an introduction to the subject. The presentation is dramatic (maybe even a little corny for us grownups, but it's still just a matter of taste), the color film (most of which is very well chosen) brings it all to life, and, most interestingly, the story is told almost entirely from the point of view of German citizens. You get a feeling of something sinister developing right before your eyes as an entire nation slowly and deliberately makes itself indescribably insane - and scarcely notices.

The fact that 300,000 German Jews applied for U.S. visas just before war and only one was granted by the State Department is, all by itself, a springboard for discussion. When the Nazis allowed some Jews to leave the country on the liner ""St. Louis,"" neither the U.S. nor Canada would allow them to land.  The ship was turned away. The passengers wound up back in Europe, where most all died in the Holocaust.",1330387200,3,1764,4.817880794701987

The Amazon.com reviews for ""The Third Reich"" were written between 2010 and 2011, and I applaud the fact that the subject is still being studied and taught in schools.

I wrote a term paper in 1957 about the reasons for the rise of the Third Reich. It was very difficult for me develop any plausible explanations. Every few years I revisit this topic and add a few of my observations. It is somewhat reassuring that no one else has yet written something that is fully satisfying. We just keep trying!

My main point in this review is that we must keep remembering what happened and do our best to make sure that it never happens again. Considering our human frailties, we cannot be certain that we will have the vision and courage to prevent similar events. In fact we have not. In the 1990's we had ""ethnic cleansing"" in Bosnia and now we have major humanitarian problems in the Sudan. At least these are on a much smaller scale than the Holocaust.

In his book titled ""Physics of the Future"", Micho Kaku expresses optimism about the future. His examples are that technology such as Twitter and YouTube keep making it more difficult for dictators to keep people ignorant.",1313798400,4,1418,4.705645161290323

The stories she told me, came to life watching this documentry and really struck home. Thankfully, they were able to live to tell their story.

For her being a young lady in those times and to see what she went through is unbelievable. Her stories came to life watching this documentry and I have so much repect and love for her.

Didn't the Treaty of Versailles  prohibit Germany from building a war machine/military? Why did Europe and the Allies stand by while this industry was building?  It certainly was not a secret.
I recommend Sophie Scholl, the Final Days,as a companion to this DVD,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sophie-Scholl-The-Final-Days/dp/B000H5V8H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sophie Scholl - The Final Days</a>&nbsp;to hear the ""rest of the story"".

While the average German citizen did stand by and watch, I wonder how different any of the rest of the world would have been, under similar circumstances.  It's the politicians that create, make the decisions, and the best and brightest, and the youngest, that die for them.

2012...This is a 2 DVD set, The Rise on one dvd, The Fall on the second.  They tell the story from various (civilian and non) viewponts, following individual lives throughout.  I keep coming back to this movie, it continues to be very moving and informative, recommend highly.  Gives insight into Why the average German behaved as he did. It took Germany approx 40yrs to rebuild...no wonder they favor austerity in the current economic situation.",1309996800,,1855,5.362068965517241
4295346,4,B0049TC8CQ,"Excellent overview of rise and fall of Hitler's Germany using some video I had never seen before, including German home movies.  However, the film makers use cutesy special video effects throughout, especially film leaders with the requisite broken sprocket holes and patches to give that ""authentic"" look. By the third time it was more than irritating. If you can get used to this, the film is definitely worth seeing.",1308787200,,419,5.072463768115942
4295347,5,B0049TC8CQ,Outstanding!! Anybody interested in WW2 would enjoy and learn from this Dvd set. It gives you a point of view not often seen.,1308700800,,125,4.478260869565218
4295348,5,B0049TC8CQ,"Very interesting and complete review of the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The presentation was almost completly done with archival movies taken by 'regular' people, and voiceovers of written material such as diaries. The greatest point made was that the German People were all guilty, since most just accepted what they were being told by the Nazies, or just looked the other way when they knew they were being lied to. The lesson of the presentation was to 'Always Question Authority'. Standers-by are just as guilty as the perpatraters because they let them get away with 'it', whatever 'it' may be.",1308614400,3,605,4.883495145631068
4295349,5,B0049TC8CQ,"Review of the Third Reich: Rise and Fall

I purchased this documentary from Amazon based on seeing a part of it on TV.  It is an extraordinary documentary in that it presents the rise and fall of Nazi Germany exclusively from the perspective of the Germans.  It demonstrates the dangers of a dictatorship and how a nation that followed one man, Adolph Hitler, based on his own ideologies, brought a nation to defeat and nearly destroyed the world.  It is a powerful and absorbing documentary that is exceptionally well done and shouldn't be missed, whether one is a history buff or not.  There are lessons to be learned about dictatorships, how they can occur, and destroy our freedom and individuality.

4295350,4,B0049TC8CQ,"This doc demands your attention right from the start.  I just got it and plan to use it for my world history class.  It has many points that allow the teacher to stop the film and expand on.  By using first person footage from everyday Germans, it gives a chilling portrait of the Nazi Party (unequalled in any other doc I've seen).  My daughters were captivated the first time we put it on and stayed with it through its entirety.  Can't wait to use it in the classroom.  If you use film in the classroom, this doc is down right hellified good.  Your class will be sitting on edge throughout the viewing.",1306972800,3,605,4.348214285714286
4295351,3,B0049TC8CQ,"While learn something new from any historical program from the History Channel, I was not crazy about the high speed switches in scene and the old film reel effects. I thought it distracted from the story. Of course, younger viewers will love it because it is machine-gun paced and they probably think the film really did skip and stutter along like that. A little gimmicky but worth seeing. I will use in the classroom as well. Be prepared--- more students than I thought watch History Channel--- a pleasant surprise for me!",1306627200,12,525,4.78021978021978
4295352,4,B0049TC8CQ,I showed this video for my freshmen world history class... unlike many movies I've tried to show in the past my students couldn't stop watching this. It looks at wwii from the perspective of the german people... a refreshing change from the norm. I love this documentary!,1306195200,2,271,4.787234042553192

German home footage combined with newsreels and voice overs leaves one spellbound.  One of the best documentaries on Nazi Germany that I have seen, and I have seen quite a few.  Be sure and see both parts - The Third Reich: The Rise - and - The Third Reich: The Fall.",1522972800,,394,4.283783783783784
8419362,5,B0049TC8CQ,"A haunting version of the rise and fall, sans the huge and horribly destructive middle, using home movies, creepy mood music soundtrack and creepy narration. An excellent boiling down of what was really going on in thirties Germany.
Take note of the propaganda and various pressures and then note today's Democrats and their massive propaganda media machine.",1521072000,,358,5.298245614035087

8419364,2,B0049TC8CQ,"Good subject matter. Unfortunately,  the History Channel ruined it by turning it into a Michael Bay Hollywood-style movie production. Quick-cuts, film ""special effects"", and a jumbled production really ruined it. Also came across as sappy, cheesy one-sided Anti-German propaganda. If this is what passes as today's idea of a war documentary, heaven help us. Not even worth $5. Older war documentaries such as Victory at Sea, World at War, and Secrets of War are much better.",1520035200,3,474,5.2368421052631575

8419366,5,B0049TC8CQ,this was an add on item and actually was one of the better documentaries I have seen about Germany's dark history.  Incredible value and great documentary.,1518912000,,155,4.961538461538462
8419367,4,B0049TC8CQ,"As I have seen many WWII documentaries, this particular one provides an unique perspective as it is mostly told through the words ie diaries of regular German citizens.  I rate this as 4.75 out of 5 stars.  Also, please be careful as to who you allow to view this documentary, as it is extremely intense and no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to view this.
This dvd is banned in Germany, even today!",1517529600,,409,4.298701298701299
