8292541,4,B001DB6J5K,"Both titles in this Gene Hackman double feature are anamorphic widescreen rather than the 1.33:1 aspect ratio ascribed to them by Amazon in its product specs listed above (although 'Under Suspicion' is offered in an alternate fullscreen version).  The first disc, Walter Hill's 'Geronimo' (1993), is a fine fictionalized biopic, overlooked at the time of its release, boasting some breathtaking cinematography and epic-scale supporting performances by Hackman and Robert Duvall (leads Wes Studi, who convincingly portrays the legendary Apache warrior, Matt Damon and Jason Patric, while arguably not as memorable as their veteran co-stars, also are uniformly good).  No issues with picture or audio quality but, sadly, no extras, either.  4-minus stars for the film; 3 1/2 for presentation.  The second disc, 1999's 'Under Suspicion' is a stylish yet somewhat overworked 'one room' murder-mystery/police procedural/psychological thriller whose conceits are mitigated nicely by principals Hackman and Morgan Freeman.  Includes a making-of featurette and running commentary by Freeman and director Stephen Hopkins.  Movie rates 3 1/2 stars; presentation 4.  However incompatible thematically this coupling may be, still a solid set for the price.",1365206400,2,1244,5.8397790055248615
