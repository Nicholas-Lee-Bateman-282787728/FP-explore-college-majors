5721695,5,B00CFODA5G,"This documentary is authentic, honest and utterly fantastic. I laughed, cried and at times was jumping out of my seat from excitement! The friendship that Kevin built with the locals is humanity at its best...I was uplifted and inspired by the end of the movie.  A must see!",1370476800,,274,4.708333333333333
5721696,5,B00CFODA5G,i wasn't expecting to smile during this movie but i did. Amazing to see how the filmaker was able to shoot real life stories in Iran. Great storytelling..Characters are fascinating. The interaction between Kevin and the locals make you think that people are so much more important than governments.,1370476800,3,298,5.1020408163265305
5721697,5,B00CFODA5G,"I can't even begin to tell you how much fun this film is. A friend had tickets to go but couldn't go so I took my husband who knows nothing about Iran but loves basketball. We had no idea what the film was about but literally within minutes, we were hooked. What a vibrant, fun, smart and utterly eye-opening documentary. Watch it with friends - you will have a ball!",1370476800,,367,4.257142857142857
5721698,4,B00CFODA5G,"The title sounds like some action fiction but this is a documentary and also involves sports.  What do you do if you're a good
college basketball player, want to play for a pro team after graduation, but don't get picked up in the US?  One option is to play as a member of a professional team in another country.  That is the basis of this film: Kevin Sheppard from the US, and a 7 foot tall Serbian player are picked up by the basketball team of Shiraz, Iran which had just made it into the major leagues.  Their goal:
make the playoffs--meaning they had to finish at least 8th out of 13 teams, something no other team in Iran's history had done in its first year in the major league.  Iran's rules allowed each team to accept 2 foreigners maximum.  Sheppard's contract essentially iis that he must get the Shiraz team into the finals, or the contract ends.

It turns out that as he begins, George W. Bush, who called Iran a member of the ""Axis of Evil"", Is President of the U.S. and considering whether or not to militarily strike as urged by Israel, to inhibit Iran's nuclear reactor program.  As the games continue, Obama wins the next election and is sworn in in January, and Iran undergoes its own election, in which Ahmadinejad is seriously challenged by the reform candidate Mir-Hossein Moussavi in 2009, in the so-called ""green movement"".  Ultimately Ahmadinejad was rapidly declared winner by a fairly wide margin, demonstrations break out in Teheran and other large cities, and are rapidly repressed by the police and the revolutionary guards.  Moussavi and his wife remain under house arrest.  And the Shiraz team...
well, I shouldn't spoil the ending...

Intresting story of two different cultures, seen
up-close from the eyes of an American
basketball player.  B+",1415491200,,1777,4.749185667752443
5721699,5,B00CFODA5G,I decided to order this documentary because I'm a basketball fan. I enjoyed every second of this film. Great job Kevin Sheppard!,1403740800,,128,4.863636363636363
5721700,5,B00CFODA5G,"Great documentary! I really liked that this film offers a glimpse at Iran, at what goes on inside Iranian houses and at the relationships between Iran and the US, something that we do not see enough of outside the news. The people involved are all really lovable and full of life and make the viewing a joyous and interesting experience. Highly recommended!",1403654400,2,357,4.774193548387097
5721701,5,B00CFODA5G,"AWESOME!

I was not expecting to enjoy every second of this documentary! A must see! I liked it so much that I am going to buy it, so I can keep and watch it again.  It changed mr perspective on so many issues.",1403481600,,210,3.86046511627907

5721703,5,B00CFODA5G,"Fascinating documentary about American basketball player Kevin Sheppard who signs on to play pro in Iran. Sheppard is so engaging with an open mind to the inevitable cultural surprises of living in a distant land. Director Till Schauder packs a lot into this documentary, with compelling editing by David Teague and a great score with original music by Kareem Roustom.",1396137600,,368,5.15
5721704,4,B00CFODA5G,"The Iran Job from Director Till Schauder is the latest entry in the Film on Friday series. As with all Film Movement releases, it was an official selection at multiple film festivals.

 I watched most of the Winter Olympics - and read of the controversy and upset surrounding what should be a politically neutral event.  The Iran Job also uses sports as a platform to explore a politically charged country and its people - in a distinctly different platform. Basketball.

 American Kevin Sheppard is a journeyman basketball player - he makes his living playing for overseas teams. When approached to play by a fledgling team in the Iranian Super League, he accepts.

 I've heard of the overseas leagues, but to be honest, had no idea that Iran had a league - and loads of avid fans!

 Schauder's choice of Sheppard as a focal point of his film was a good choice. Sheppard is extremely engaging. It is this engaging manner that allows him to make friends in a time and place that is not US friendly. While it is fascinating to watch the basketball team, it is the people that allow themselves to be filmed as they talk openly to Sheppard that were the stars. Kevin makes friends with three young Iranian women and they share their thoughts about and hopes for their country. Sheppard's interactions with his teammates, apartment building superintendent, roommate, shopkeepers and more kept me engaged for the full 95 minutes. Schauder's film gave me a look at everyday Iran -a change from the nightly news stories. An excellent documentary well worth watching. (With a great soundtrack) English and Farsi with subtitles. 95 minutes.

 As always, Film Movement includes a bonus short film. City Bomber is also from Till Schauder. I can see the tie-in with the main feature, but it didn't hold my attention. A German architect decides to bomb a downtown building - but is horrified to find his young daughter arriving just before it is set to detonate. It's shot in black and white, with choppy cutaways and significant stills. I can see the director flexing his artistic muscles, but it was a miss for me. German with English subtitles. 22 min.",1394150400,,2142,4.793478260869565
5721705,4,B00CFODA5G,"...and who knew that Iran had it's own professional basketball leagues?

For a generation plus, Iran (generally), its theocratic (or just plain belligerent) political leaders and Iranians (generally) have served as a bogeyman to the the West (and also for Israel and various Arab states).

""The Iran Job"" follows the journey of Kevin Sheppard from his home in the US Virgin Islands to a stint with the newest member of Iran's ""Super"" basketball league, A.S. Shiraz based in that southwestern Iranian city. Sheppard played college hoops at Jacksonville University. Unable to break into the NBA, A.S. Shiraz is the next stop on an overseas professional career that has taken him to other foreign leagues (including China, Isreal and Brazil). Along with Zoran (a Serb), he is one of the two foreign players permitted on each Super League team.

This documentary is very little about basketball and mostly about the meeting --and sometimes the clash-- of cultures. A trip to sports medicine clinic places Sheppard in contact with three Iranian women who chafe at many of the cultural, political and religious conventions of their life. Directors Till Shchauder and Sara Nodjoumi go easy on the political commentary, and let the facts speak for themselves. They do this through images captured in the streets of Shiraz, and through the mouths of American media and political figures (this takes place through the end of the 2008 campaign and through inauguration).

While interesting and deserving illumination, I was surprised at Sheppard's decisions to not only sustain contact with these women, but to also offer them alcohol. I couldn't help but feel the latter was overly contrived, and seemed an overly risky choice that could have led to serious consequences for everybody involved.

Even if you aren't a basketball fan, this documentary has an excellent ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" appeal, and is well worth watching. Excellent Farsi-language hip-hop soundtrack (I sure wish I knew what they were saying!).

This is an offering from the Film Movement series; Film Movement provided a copy for review purposes.",1393804800,,2113,5.181818181818182
5721706,5,B00CFODA5G,"Kevin Sheppard, a basketball star from the US Virgin Islands, found himself at something of a dead end after graduating from college but failing to find a place within the NBA.  He began to play for foreign teams and eventually found himself signing a contract to play for the Iranian team A.S. Shiraz.  That's the beginning point for this funny, warm, and insightful documentary about Kevin's year in Iran.

The film runs chronologically from about mid 2008 to mid 2009, starting with Kevin telling his family and friends goodbye before flying to Iran.  We see him meeting his new roommate, his coaches and sponsors, and his teammates.  Most importantly he meets three young Iranian women, who become his friends and help him acclimate to his new environment, while he in turn leads them to articulate some of their dissatisfactions with their own lives.  There are a lot of really funny moments, especially during the Christmas season when Kevin searches high and low for some sort of evergreen to decorate.  There are also plenty of reminders of the tense world surrounding Kevin and his friends including  film of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Mahmoud Amadinejab making threatening speeches.  The last scenes are set during the 2009 post-Iranian election protests, another reminder of the serious issues that underlie this documentary.

The Iran Job is a lot of fun because Kevin and his friends are friendly and appealing.  But it's also a highly insightful examination of the way cultures meet and intermingle, even when the countries involved are less than friendly.",1391990400,,1577,5.05019305019305
5721707,5,B00CFODA5G,"Kevin Sheppard's experiences in Iran were utterly fascinating.  Kevin's wit and humor made him a great observer of Iranian society.

5721710,5,B00CFODA5G,"I have not seen a movie like this before, and for anyone interested in seeing real life inside modern-day Iran, do not miss this film.  You get a taste for everyday life, from shopping to home life, the community sporting events which are central to the film, as well as the power and intrusiveness of the government under which Iranians must live. And using basketball as the vehicle for bringing this view to the outside world is a stroke of brilliance.  Kevin Sheppard is extraordinary.  His spirit is infectious, and you can see how his friends, neighbors, teammates, and even strangers gravitate to him.  But Schauder and Nodjoumi have captured the natural beauty of each of the main subjects of this documentary, and given even those of us somewhat familiar with Iranian culture a totally new view.",1379462400,,804,4.846715328467154
5721711,4,B00CFODA5G,"I am a long-time fan of the foreign and indie movie library of Film Movement, and am a subscriber of the Film Movement DVD-of-the-month club (more on that later).

""The Iran Job"" (2012 release; 95 min.) is a documentary that brings us the story of Kevin Sheppard, a US basketball player who didn't make it into the NBA but did find a career as a ""journey man"" (his own words) in foreign basketball leagues. In the Fall of 2008, he is signed by a team in the Iranian Super League and off he goes for a full season of basketball in Iran. The team he plays for is A.S. Shiraz, a city of about 1.5 million people. Sheppard moves into an apartment with another foreign player on the team, a guy from Serbia. The team has just achieved promotion into the Super League and no first year Super League team has ever made the play-offs. Will Sheppard be able to lead them into the play-offs? The other part of the movie is even more compelling, as we get a glimpse of the ordinary lives of ordinary people in a large city in Iran. Sheppard befriends many locals, including several woman (in the platonic sense, of course, as we are reminded that ""kissing is illegal in Iran""). As the movie plays out, we get snippets from the then US presidential campaign and eventual swearing in of Obama (and how ordinary Iranians react to that), and in a parallel track in early '09 Iran is gearing up for its own presidential elections.

Several comments: kudos to writer-director-photographer Till Schauder, who basically moved with Sheppard to Iran and followed Sheppard around day in and day out for the entire season. The end result, showing that ordinary people in Iran live and breathe and support their basketball team and get upset about things just like we do, is nothing short of extraordinary. In that sense, this movie is far more political than it is a sports documentary, and it brings to mind of course that 2012 documentary from Jafar Panahi called ""This Is Not A Film"", another must-see about life in Iran. As if it wasn't clear yet, ""The Iran Job"" is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Back to Film Movement: I got this DVD a few days ago as the June '13 ""DVD-of-the-month"" release of an on-going subscription that I have. I was floored to see that ""The Iran Job"" has already been up-and-running for weeks here on Amazon as an instant video (and at about one-third of the price that I'm paying for my DVD-of-the-month club subscription). I contacted Film Movement right away about this, and was told that (supposedly) they had planned to release ""The Iran Job"" months ago, but that ""circumstances beyond their control"" had delayed the release to their subscribers until now, by which time Amazon had the contractual right to stream this movie as an instant video, and that this would ""never"" happen again.",1372377600,,2794,4.651821862348178

5721715,5,B00CFODA5G,"This is a rare look into Iranian everyday life, especially the lives of women. It was great to see the culture through the eyes of Kevin, who is both funny and thoughtful. I had no idea basketball is as popular as it is there, which itself was illuminating and fun too. The sports scenes were exciting, but the scenes with Kevin's women friends were especially moving. To me, the movie is important, because it makes an effort to humanize everyone. I hope it helps increase understanding and bring peace. Highly recommend!",1370563200,,522,4.747252747252747

5721717,5,B00CFODA5G,I didn't know much about the film when I watched it so I was really curious. It was great. It was funny and exciting and truthful. Kevin was the perfect person for this film.

I felt like African Americans are so much closer to Iranians and understand their culture better and Iranians seem to trust African Americans. Not knowing much about politics, I now better understand why Iranians seemed to get along better with President Obama. But, Iranian people do not seem to like their own ""Islamic"" government and are fighting to establish a sort of government that is democratic; a system that guaranties basic human rights for its citizens. Perhaps time has arrived for an end to any type of dictatorship, religious or otherwise. As an American, I wish Iranian people luck in their quest for freedom and justice for all.",1512172800,,752,5.024

Glimpse of the thoughts and opinions of women who are, for the most part, forced to submit to the will of men. I wasn't a big fan of the cinematography...it felt very amateurish...too much zoom, not much focus on composition...often felt too close to the people being interviewed.
Overall, I recommend the film for content. It's something new. A side of Iran unfamiliar to most Americans.",1431820800,,477,5.128205128205129

8581373,5,B00CFODA5G,"A great and honest view of what was happing in Iran around 2009. You get a sense of issues young people struggles with. It is not a sappy story of kid who has lost his shoes. It covers a different set of issues that you normally don't see in the movies about Iran. It is just sad to see how little this movie earned at the box office. So much Hollywood garbage out there that earns orders of magnitude more than amazing documentaries covering real life of people on this earth.
