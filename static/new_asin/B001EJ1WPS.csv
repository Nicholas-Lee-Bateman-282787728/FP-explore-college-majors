TERENCE IS SO MESMORISING TO WATCH AND INTELLECTUALY STIMULATING- AN ELOQUANT SPEAKER WITH A SHARP WIT. ACTUALLY FUNNY AS HELL! I LIKE  THE STORY WITH TERENCE AS NARRATOR AND CHARACTER. IN HIS USUAL FLAIR, HE BREAKS OFF THE MOST INTRIGUING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING CORNER OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND PRESENTS IT TO US: THE HUMBLE VIEWER. THE ENDING WAS MOVING ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET WATER IN MY EYE.(AWWH!) AT 60 MINUTES LONG THOUGH, I WAS ACHING AND YEARNING FOR MORE SOUL EXPANSION ! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  TO ANYONE WHO WAS ASLEEP AND TRULY WANTS THAT VEIL LIFTED!! R*I*P* TERENCE - LUV YA MAN !!",1398729600,2,753,4.529411764705882

8298325,2,B001EJ1WPS,"I initially got this video based on the title and that it comes from the Sacred Mysteries Camp.  I was under the impression that there would be some sort of modern presentation on Alchemy from a scientific and historical point of view, and possibly how that relates to the scientific and holistic communities today.

What I discovered was that this is more theater than anything, with a lot of 70's ish ""trippy"" psychedelic overtones and references intertwined with some historical data and lore from Elizabethan times.  The video itself is done well and is about 55 minutes in length.

Before this video I had not heard of Terence McKenna, so this was a new experience for me. Obviously from the other reviews if you are into this person's work then you will most likely enjoy this video.  However, if you are like me and into current metaphysical and spiritual viewpoints and how these concepts play into our everyday current experiences, then you will not appreciate the content of this video. 2 Stars based on content.

8298326,5,B001EJ1WPS,I have been a fan of TM for close to 15 years now.  I had never heard of this movie until recently.  I quickly snappped up my own copy.  This is a must have for collectors of TM material.,1257120000,7,187,3.7435897435897436
8298327,5,B001EJ1WPS,"Alchemy.  What is it?  Terence McKenna, known mostly as a shaman and psychonaut, reveals to the world his knowledge of alchemy, its history, and why it is so important today.  McKenna studied occultism in his teens; he was influenced by such great thinkers and Frances Yates and H.P. Blavatsky.  Although he spoke rarely on the subject, we now have a beautifully produced film that reveals the depth of his knowledge.  Those who want to read more of Terence's ideas on alchemy should be able to find a transcript of his ""Lectures on Alchemy"" by doing a Google search.

Filmed in Prague in the mid 1990's, Terence not only narrates both on and off screen, showing his bardic storyteller genius, but also portrays the leading figure in the story, that of Dr. John Dee.  The film is as fresh as it could be however, because all of the ideas presented are found virtually nowhere else (other than the one mentioned above) in the vast library of McKenna lectures, while his books give but scant attention to the subject.

With the explosive resurgence of esoteric and occult ideas in the past few years, the film speaks to our time.  Had it been released when it was made, it probably would have fallen into the void.  It is as if the spirit of alchemy is alive in the film, waiting for the moment when the world is ready.

The story is based on Frances Yates' scholarship, most notably the Rosicrucian Enlightenment and the story of the Winter King and Queen.  We learn of John Dee and Edward Kelly's journeys into the Enochian angelic realms, and how this inspired them to create an alchemical revolution with the aim of the transmutation of society.  This is the alchemical dream referred to in the title.  Dee and Kelly could not make this happen, however the dream was taken up later in Bohemia by Fredrick the Elector Palatine.

Highly recommended to all fans of McKenna, this will introduce them to a whole new world of Renaissance, Hermetic, Rosicrucian and Alchemical thinking.  Likewise, anyone with an interest in these subjects will be fascinated by McKenna's interpretation of what this means for our time.  Truly a remarkable film, it is a living eulogy to his genius.  One can hardly wonder whether McKenna was actually the ghost of John Dee, and that the ideas in this film are his most recent push toward the alchemical transmutation of society.",1231891200,27,2357,4.735294117647059
