4493089,5,B004X9LNAU,"Questions for Crazy Horse contemplates what the legendary Lakota Warrior known as Crazy Horse would have felt about modern issues facing his descendents, such as tribal poverty, education, religion and the continued theft of Indian lands by the American government, if he were alive today.  Oliver Tuthill examines these issues and several more with Russell Means, Jay Red Hawk and many other prominent Native Americans.

A must-see for anyone interested in the American Indian's perspective on their lives, problems and social condition.

4493090,4,B004X9LNAU,"We all know the legend of Crazy horse...or do we?  By speaking with his people, Oliver has unearthed the myth, the legend and the feelings the Oglala Lakota have for their legendary leader.  The somber life of his descendents is hard on your heart but the spirit of Crazy Horse lives on in their way of looking at the Black Hills and their life there.  Every child should see this video as part of any study of the American Indian.  History has not been kind to the Lakota.  Maybe we can learn something from their ordeal that will make us treat our fellow man differently in the future.  You should see this for yourself.",1308614400,16,622,4.412280701754386
4493091,4,B004X9LNAU,"There are many views of how Native people lived and are now living.  Not all of us are in agreement over this issue.  I do believe if Crazy Horse were alive today, he would be angry of how his people were not only living, but acting as well.  I would like to think he would be a true leader and lead his people in ways to better themselves, such as obtaining an education and refraining from the use of alcohol and drugs.  Also, I would like to believe he would be an example and encourage the people to a path of being successful in their present lives.  The old way of living may be gone, but it doesn't have to be forgotten and as a white, I don't want it to be forgotten.  I for one consider the Native American culture as a part of my American culture.  I do not consider myself as a European American, but rather a Native American.  There are many ways to keep that spirit alive even in today's world.  This DVD was nicely done, However, I would have liked many more scenes of the life of Crazy Horse.  Jay Red Hawk did an outstanding job as Crazy Horse and I'm sure as he was directed, but I wish he had a speaking part with possible insights as to his thoughts on this subject.  I liked the DVD and will order it and will add it to my collection of many videos of Native Americans.",1307664000,9,1289,4.116

8446552,4,B004X9LNAU,Russell Means did an excellent job of compiling comentary from the people of the Black Hills about what Crazy Horse would have thought if he saw the Black Hills today. Crazy Horse was a warrior who put his people first. His following grew out of respect. He was the last of his people to surrender to the government. Like most historical heros we must view this documentary with a little skeptisim ot what is fact and what is legend. Definitely skewed in the direction of making him out to be a very powerful man betrayed by his own people in the end.,1362355200,3,551,4.411764705882353
8446553,5,B004X9LNAU,"This is a powerful film asking the greatest hero of America his views of the aftermath and legacy of the USA's treatment of the native people and mostly his Oglala and Lakota descendants. Having visited Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills, several times myself it is interesting to hear and see what he might have made of it. Wonderful stuff. I have been a fan of Russell Means for a number of years and he stands up for his people and is a great spokesperson for native people.",1355011200,9,482,4.426966292134831
8446554,5,B004X9LNAU,"This is an amazing gem of a film! It is rare to find a good documentary about Crazy Horse. It is even rarer find to find a good documentary that contains such candid and insightful interviews from native American Indians. This documentary provides unique interviews of members of the Lakota Sioux discussing issues that have been haunting them for years. For this reason alone I would recommend this film! It is original in its concept and delivery in expressing how the Lakota feel about Crazy Horse and his impact on present day Indians, and as far as I know no film has ever been produced by an independent producer that shows not only the Crazy Horse Memorial but how the Native Peoples feel about the memorial. It is interesting to note that one reviewer stated there was limited footage on Jay Red Hawk. Frankly, I didn't understand this comment at all since the DVD contains a special feature which is 45 minutes long -- almost a separate documentary in and of itself, which I found to be as fascinating as the main film. Russell Means remains a compelling figure whose historical impact on the Lakota is as powerful as Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, Black Elk and Crazy Horse himself. History will show Russell Means to be one of the great Native American leaders of the 20th Century and he continues to be a compelling voice of Native Americans. This is a film that belongs in the collection of all those interested in the history of North American Plains Indians and the Sioux in particular. The film is also suitable for children to watch. Highly recommended!",1310774400,8,1564,4.6909090909090905
8446555,5,B004X9LNAU,"Oliver Tuthill's documentary, Questions for Crazy Horse, enabled me to learn more about the Lakota People and their legendary leader Crazy Horse.  Sometimes magical with often whimsical re-enactments of Crazy Horse traversing the Black Hills, and other times sobering, this film takes an unabashed look at some of the issues which currently plague the Lakota people today; The government interfereance and confiscation of the Black Hills, and the extreme poverty and lack of opportunity the people face with education, freedom of religion over time, etc.  Despite the issues the Lakota face, and what little our government is doing to help them, Tuthill's film offers a glimpse into what gives them inspiration, the memory of their fearless and strong leader, Crazy Horse.  Through the fortitude and wisdom they surmise he would continue to have in the difficult situations they now face, one cannot help but think they will continue to survive through the ages.  This film is a testament to the human spirit and also a very eye-opening portrait of Crazy Horse and his people.  I highly recommened this to anyone who wants to know more about the Lakota people and Crazy Horse.",1309392000,13,1176,5.104166666666667
