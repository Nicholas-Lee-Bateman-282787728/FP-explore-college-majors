4043004,3,B00308BAYO,"This DVD has amazing visual production, it is crisp and clear -the set is simple and uncluttered. Although I was not challenged by this video I think it is a great place for beginners to start out.  It is definitely safe, uses all of the muscle groups and incorporates interval training and compound exercises. Some pluses of the video are that it is not quick moving. Tomei takes frequent breaks to roll her neck out, stretch her hamstrings, etc between exercises.  I could find very little that the average person looking to workout could not do.",1275350400,15,548,4.697916666666667
4043005,5,B00308BAYO,"I ran across this item at Target and didn't expect it to be that great--truth be told, the major selling point compared to similar DVDs was that it included the toning band. But I fell in love with this workout!

The video is very well shot, and Marisa and her trainer are so low key and relaxed. Their instructions are kept to a minimum and the unobtrusive music helps you keep your focus--something you'll definitely need during the many moves that require you to balance on one leg. I sprained my knee a few months ago and ever since, my vastus medialis (the muscle behind the kneecap) has been achy and prone to catching. Leg lifts at the gym were  Well, many of the exercises strengthen the quads and the muscle directly above the kneecap, and even though my VM is still sore the stiffness has been greatly alleviated.

The cardio bursts are short (30-60 sec) but they keep your heart rate up enough to make everything else just a little bit more challenging. I did all three workouts in a row and was sweating, but not exhausted. Several of the moves combine stretching with toning, so even though I woke up sore the next day, I didn't feel stiff. I started out with Jillian Michaels Burn Fat Boost Metabolism & 30 Day Shred, but at my current level of fitness her programs are so intense that I can only do them once a week. This a great alternative, and I look forward to trying Marisa's HoopBand workout that's slated to come out in August!",1275004800,23,1449,4.460377358490566
4043006,5,B00308BAYO,"About me: I've cancelled my gym membership and have been expanding my exercise video collection.  I have noisy, weak knees-they make noises going up and down stairs.  The bigger issue is my hips:they are in a very bad way and I have no choice but to strengthen my hips, glutes and hamstrings.  I fluctuate weight-always have- and I'm at my maximum allowable which is about 20 pounds over weight.  I bought this one becasue lets' face it, Marisa has an absolutely fantastic body and she is my age--I would love to look like her & I LIKE looking at someone I aspire to look like when I work out.  If it's a normal looking person or an overweight person, I feel like the exercises didn't help them, so they probably won't help me either...  I was pleasantly surprised with this workout.  The included band is awesome-I may use it for other things too-reminded me of many of the exercises I did during 4 months of physical therapy.  I was also very surprised at the gentle focus of the knees--the area right above the knee.  They focus on form the entire time and Marisa gives you tips for things that help her during the workout.  It's definitely not a cardio workout so to speak--they do make you do some quick moves periodically to keep your heart rate up, but you would need a lot more of that to really keep your heartrate up.  I'm a big fan of Jillian Michaels, but many days I can't go that hardcore due to pain and this dvd is for a NON Jillian day!  I felt sore the next day, so I was pleased.  I was able to complete all the workouts--unlike my Jillian dvds and quite a few others too.  I love the balancing which engages the core--I also love to workout barefoot which they encourage because it uses additional muscles to do so--the mixture of core/ balance/ toning, was refreshing and I felt great afterward.  The band worked my hips perfectly.  I have tendons and ligaments that are too loose which is causing all kinds of issues--it's technically called Osteitis Condensans Illi and working out, chiropractor & massage therapy have helped me to walk again.  If I don't work out, I don't walk well--I have to keep the muscles strong and tight, and this gently fit the bill!  This workout may be too easy for some, but again, if you use your body correctly, tighten the right things, focus on your form, you can make it harder.  If you struggle to find exercises that aren't hard on your knees--this one is perfect.  I have another favorite new video and that's Tracy Andersons post pregnancy workout dvd--also very gentle and was sore for many days after on that one--couldn't finish all the exercises, but it really focuses on core/ab work, so I used this one after that one.  I try to mix it up and do something different constantly, but I like this one for an easy day-realizing it may not be for everyone.",1274313600,30,2818,4.486274509803922
4043007,5,B00308BAYO,Watched this once for before completing my first workout--don't let this quiet workout fool you it is tough.  My legs and core were shaking when I was through.  I look forward to incorporating this into my routine.,1273881600,11,214,4.756756756756757
4043008,5,B00308BAYO,"I ordered this and finally had a chance to open it. WOW what a great workout. I love finding new workouts and this is SO different. The band and positions are fun, new and effective! I would highly recommend this DVD.TRULY A WONDERFUL SURPRISE!

4043009,5,B00308BAYO,"When I first saw that Marisa Tomei was coming out with a workout DVD I laughed, or maybe ""snorted with derision"" would be more accurate . . . I love Marisa Tomei as an actress, but I just felt like the world didn't need another ""celebrity"" workout.

But, I was wrong.

This workout is actually really fun, well produced, seems to be very effective, and has that all too rare ""it"" factor that makes me want to keep coming back to it over and over again . . . no ""dread factor"" here.  The instructor offers great cuing, and Ms. Tomei is personable and demonstrates good form.

As to the workout itself, it's not exactly traditional toning, but it's not Pilates either . . . it is very core-focused, and does work on lots of little accessory muscles that aren't normally targeted in more traditional toning workouts.  There are no deep lunges or squats, but there are quite a few plank-based moves as well as traditional push-ups.  Interspersed throughout all three workouts are little ""speed and agility"" bursts of skipping, hopping and side-stepping, so there is a (albeit minimal) cardio factor as well. The DVD includes a resistance band that you use looped around your ankles in quite a few of the moves - this definitely increases the burn, and is not ""gimicky"" at all.

There are three individual workouts.  The first is about 25 minutes long, and targets the entire body, with a very long and intense ab section.  The second workout, which is about 20 minutes long, is all about the legs, although it does work the core as well.  The final workout, about 15 minutes long, is a mini total body workout, with some exercises borrowed from the first two workouts, but some other unique exercises as well.  There is a brief warm-up and cool-down/stretch included when you play each individual workout.  The ""custom workout"" option is a nice tool that allows you to play the individual workouts back-to-back, in whichever order you choose.  In that mode, the warm-up in only played once, at the beginning, and the cool-down/stretch is only played once, at the end of the workout.

All in all, I must say I was surprised by how fun and effective this workout is.  I am an intermediate level exerciser, and I found most of this workout very doable, but still challenging.",1271289600,98,2268,4.6775818639798485
4043010,4,B00308BAYO,"I liked the video.  Good explanation of moves, maybe not as detailed as a newbie would want.  Also, she did like 1000 crunches--this was almost impossible for me to keep up with.  I am not a beginner but I am also not that far advanced yet.  NO lower level moves were explained. I did the video last night and I am sore today.. so it just may work on toning.  If is see improvement within a few weeks,  I will come back and upgrade my rating..
Update..
I am back to increase my rating to 4 stars.  I have been doing the dvd about 3 times a week and feel some improvement. I also really like the fact that you have a few choices for workouts.  There is the full workout, the 10 minute version and a shapeup for legs that is my favorite now.
.. I am not a man obsessed with Marisa so take my review for what it is worth..also, it is definitely a currently made dvd with Marisa as she looks now.",1270598400,38,892,4.028409090909091
4043011,5,B00308BAYO,"This is an hour-long DVD of Marisa Tomei wearing a spandex outfit, working out. She stretches, wiggles and sweats a little bit.

I can't possibly imagine what more needs to be said here.",1270425600,10,229,4.846153846153846
4043012,4,B00308BAYO,This was clearly taped in the 90's. Marisa looks to be in her early 30's. She's 45 or 46 now. My guess is this was sitting in a vault somewhere and just released. That means it was probably done without Marisa's permission so grab it now befor she sues!,1270252800,,253,4.183673469387755
4043013,4,B00308BAYO,"I like this dvd. It is different. Marisa Tomei does a good job w/her instructor. One thing though the band that is provided with the workout, is too small for tall people or normal people with good size ankles/feet!!!. It hurts my back using it, because I can barely can move with it. It is supposed to provide some resistance, but not make it impossible for users to move!!!  I plan on using other bands I have, but it is not a bad workout to change up the pace!!!",1406332800,,465,4.224719101123595

4043016,5,B00308BAYO,I'm horrible at sticking to something after I start and I get turned off by workout DVDs that promise to be easy and leave me unsure which direction we were stepping or how-do-i-even-make-my-leg-do-that. I've been raving to all my friends about how easy this DVD really is. I'm sure those who are more familiar with workout DVDs or have that drive to workout all the time will get bored with this DVD. I don't have an athletic bone in my body. THIS WORKS FOR ME!,1396915200,3,462,4.447058823529412
4043017,5,B00308BAYO,So happy I purchase Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves. This easy to learn video really challenges the muscles. The small movements are short but intense. Very HAPPY!!,1395100800,,160,4.962962962962963
4043018,1,B00308BAYO,I did NOT like this workout at all. It's too slow for me. I did like the resistance band that came with it.,1390521600,,107,3.6956521739130435
4043019,4,B00308BAYO,"I am a dedicated at-home exerciser who uses fitness videos on a daily basis; given this, I generally don't go for most celebrity and other more popular workout titles that are released.  However, I became interested in this DVD because I am trying to incorporate more resistance band work into my strength training, and the three routines on this video utilize a small, loop-style band.

Although actress Marisa Tomei's name is on this video and she is featured performing the exercises, the instructor is actually personal trainer Key Son.  Key (who I discovered has a BS from Cornell University and a doctorate degree in sports medicine) is very soft-spoken and serious throughout this video, but he really does serve in a training role to Marisa, counting her repetitions, providing her with form cues, etc.  Marisa is more laid-back and jokey than Key, but she also defers to him, such as in asking him if she is performing the exercises correctly.

The Main Menu of this DVD provides a brief (1.5 minutes) Introduction in which Key and Marisa introduce themselves and explain that the routines incorporate many exercises within a short period of time WITHOUT the use of weights.  They also note that Marisa prefers to do the exercises barefoot.  The Menu also listed the three individual workouts (described below) and has a Custom Workout option, which allows the use to select the workouts to be played in any order, playing the warm-up and cool-down stretches only once.  Finally, there is an Audio Setup option to play the workouts with instruction only or instruction plus music (default).

There are three main workouts on this DVD:  Body Refined, The Best Legs, and Total Body in 10.  Each routine automatically plays a warm-up and a cool-down which feature Marisa alone, but these are individually chaptered and thus can be skipped.  For the 2-minute warm-up sequence, Marisa starts seated.  She moves right into stretching the muscles cold, first seated, and then with several additional standing stretches, including some bouncing (ballistic) movements).  Marisa instructions the 3-minute cool-down live.  She moves VERY quickly through the stretches, starting with lunging stretches for the inner thighs and hip flexors; she does hold the reclined stretches for the hamstrings just a bit longer.

Each of the three main routines are described below.  Times given are for each workout WITHOUT the warm-up and cool-down.

BODY REFINED (22 minutes)
Marisa continue notes that this workout is ""just 20 minutes.""  It starts with floor touches, a sort of forward bend/deadlift with no weights (although Key has Marisa reach out further).  Next comes one of several ""speed and agility"" drills, this one skips to the side and back, performed twice--you will need a good amount of room in your workout space for these!  With the band just above the ankles, Key has Marisa perform a micro lunge, bending one knee forward just a bit to work the area just above the knee.  The speed and agility drill is repeated, and then the next move is a knee lift with the band again around the ankles.  The band remains around the ankles for a series of side band walks:  first with the toes pointed in, then with one foot stepping behind the other, then face forward walking on tip-toes.  The final move with the band is a bent over reach on the toes.  This is followed by a brief cardio interval of punching on one foot, and then it's down to the floor.  The first move is push-ups (on ankles is optional--Marisa does them this way due to a shoulder injury).  Next is traveling plank for shoulder stabilization.  The band is then placed around the wrists for pullovers.  Following this, the band goes back around the ankles for a long series of crunches:  50 standard crunches, 50 staggered crunches (25 per side), and 40 leg raises (second 20 with rotation).  Returning to a plank position, Key has Marisa perform 10 knee ins, and then 10 with a rotation.  Coming back to standing, the final exercise in this routine is a standing twist with the band around the ankles.

THE BEST LEGS (18 minutes)
This routine repeats many of the same exercises from the first workout, although oddly, without the band.  Key again has Marisa begin with a reach forward, this time single leg reached.  Next is a move that he calls an inverted hamstring stretch, which is basically a one leg hold (or airplane/warrior 3 from yoga), and then a knee hold, another balance on one leg.  The speed and agility drill that follows involves skips forward and back.  The micro lunge move is next, followed by BACKWARD skips.  This is followed by the one leg knee bend and then plank with a hamstring curl and pelvic raises (10 double, 10 single).  Finally, Key has Marisa come back to standing and add the band above her ankles for small leg raises, first to the front, then side, then back.  The same band walk series from the first workout is performed (i.e., toes in, one foot front/behind, forward on toes), and then a set of staggered reaches to the front on the toes concludes this workout.

TOTAL BODY IN 10 (8.5 minutes)
This streamlined routine incorporates moves from the first two workouts and is designed to be performed in a short amount of time.  The 10 moves are as follows: 1) diagonal reaches forward, 2) fast side steps (speed & agility), 3) single leg knee bend with rear leg extension, 4) moving wide jumps (speed & agility), 5) bent-over reach and pull (Key states that this is an upper body move, as you are doing sort of a row, but you are also performing sort of a deadlift), 6) bicycle crunches on floor, 7) band walks with toes in, 8) band walks with one foot forward/back, 9) band walks on toes, facing front, 10) standing rotations with band around ankles, moving arms from one waist to above opposite shoulder.

Overall, these three routines are definitely more lower-body focused, but I didn't mind that.  They are also a bit repetitive, but I liked the option of having different workout lengths to choose from.  I also think that I can easily modify the exercises to make them even more challenge--for example, I could add the band in some places where it isn't used, and I could easily hold light hand weights for some of the movements.

The only thing that I did NOT like about this DVD were the warm-up and cool-down segments that Marisa instructs alone.  I didn't have a problem with her instruction per se, but in the warm-up, she engages in cold stretching of the muscles, something that is generally frowned upon by most experts.  The cool-down is a bit better, but she simply does not hold the stretches long enough to offer much benefit (to be fair, I have this issue with most exercise video cool-downs).

In the end, however, I found this DVD to be a pleasant surprise, and it will definitely have a place in my fitness routine.",1388534400,4,6840,4.769753610875107
4043020,5,B00308BAYO,"I found this one to be a challenge but in a good way. It is quite a shock when you first do it, You think that it looks simple but it is quite challenging. Never bored. Just keep pushing and get the results.",1377907200,3,207,3.8372093023255816
4043021,5,B00308BAYO,I wasn't sure what I'd think of this dvd when I ordered it but for around $4 (with the band included) I thought I'd try it. It's different from any Jillian Michaels or Jackie Warner dvd you will do. Overall this is a great ab and leg workout that did leave me feeling a bit sore the next day without the high impact and high intensity work. It's great to have on hand for days I feel like I should work out but don't have a lot of ambition for Jillian Michaels.,1375315200,2,461,4.021739130434782

4043025,2,B00308BAYO,"I have a wide library of fitness DVDs to keep things interesting, and I ordered this one about a year ago.  I want to love it but I just don't.  I think the trainer is excellent, the music is fun and the moves are effective, but I find Marisa to be incredibly annoying!  Hey, who doesn't think she's cute as a button in a movie, but in a fitness workout, I am not looking for cute!  I also hate that the warm up and cool down are the same for all workouts, and I don't like that you are supposed to do the first routine three times in a row....why not make the routine on the DVD that long? By the time I get through it, it goes right to cool down, so going back to do over is a nuisance. I end up doing it once and feeling unfulfilled in my workout.  I also hate that during the super short warm up, she finds it necessary to start with a sweatshirt on, then take it off midway through.  So every time I do this workout, I need to wait for her to take her sweatshirt off - this is highly annoying, especially at 5:00 am on a weekday!

I think I bought this on sale very inexpensively, and I am glad for that.  I do this once in awhile when I get bored with my more intense workouts, and the toning band is nice, but otherwise, this is far from my favorite.",1365033600,2,1257,3.940711462450593

I like the actress for the most part and her body type is a lot like mine so I thought it would be a great challenge. The shorter workouts are not challenging in the least. The longer one is but only with and overkill on abs which seemed misbalanced, again, the rest is just like...""Are we working out or just watching you tippy toe around and giggle and make personal/unprofessional comments when you feel like it?"" I felt she presented herself in the wrong light also for a video aimed at a Gaiam workout. The instructor was the only reason I repeated the video in case I was having an off day. Not the case.

What I liked is that I felt my heart rate up, I felt like my body was being asked to do new things. I loved it and will continue to do this one. I feel like it will bring some good results if I do consistently.

I'd say the focus of this DVD is on small moves. Small, intentional, deliberate moves that require focus. It's brilliant and it's so refreshing from the ""feel the burn,"" huff and putt workouts I've done, which are fine as well, but for me, right now, I welcome something new.

I have to say that I was very, VERY surprised that I liked this. It reminded me at first of Cindy Crawford's workout DVDs. I know a lot of people liked her DVDs, but I just found they were terrible on my joints.

So, I expected more of the same from Marisa. I was very surprised that not only are my joints not being pounded, in fact, they're being strengthened. For those few exercises where I feel it's asking too much of my body at the moment, I just modify.

I highly recommend it and am keeping my eyes out for more DVDs like this, but in the meantime intend to wear this one out!",1340323200,3,1165,4.0964912280701755

Since I am a lover of yoga I thought wait maybe this might be good I love all of their other stuff.  Let me just say that I was blown away by the work outs when I watched them.  For me it is hard to find a good workout that just tones.  I don't want to bulk up, that is why I do yoga, but I needed to tone.  This video is perfect for that.

4043044,5,B00308BAYO,"If you want to save your knees and thus your way of life, this is the workout!!!  I feel like God led me to this workout after going to 3 orthopedic surgeons and a physical therapist.  I know Marisa may just do this for a great looking body, but these are the muscles I was told I need to strengthen to save my poor knees!!  If we strengthen the quads, IT bands, etc, we are able to keep the pressure off our knees and the knee cap stays in place with strong muscles!  In Jim Johnson's book ""Treat your own knees"", he speaks about standing on one foot for proprioception.  The moves in this video are totally in line with my physical therapist!!  Wish I'd had this workout years ago!  Never knew that such teeny tiny movements would do so much!  I'm used to jumping up and down and using heavy weights!  This truly is changing my life!  Thank you thank you thank you.  I think I'm going to buy this dvd for all my friends and family because it's so important to strengthen the muscles around the knees, quads and hips so that we have many happy years walking around and being active!! :-)",1308268800,13,1088,4.258536585365854
4043045,5,B00308BAYO,"I'm happy (and a bit surprised) to say I've found my workout for life in this short, low-key DVD. It's not exactly what you'd expect from a ""celebrity"" workout--Marisa Tomei wears a tank top and cut-off sweatpants and is very charming and normal as she goes through an unassuming routine of small, subtle, targeted movements with her very chill trainer. What is stunning about all this is that the routine works, and works beautifully.

""The method"" is nothing that I can recognize--it seems to be something between Pilates, barre, and physical therapy stuff, but is really its own breed. Trainer Key Son deserves a lot more credit for this than he is probably getting, because the results are absolutely gorgeous, and unlike anything else I've seen. I have tried a lot of different methods but can never settle on one to create exactly the proportions I want: ballet, yoga, Tracy Anderson, core fusion etc., all seem either to create too much bulk or result in a look that is very sinewy and ropy. The best things I've found have been Pilates and Lotte Berk...until now.

The workout is hard, but it is doable, and you quickly work up to it. Do it with TV or your own music, and it becomes actually enjoyable. In very little time, you develop the muscles that pull everything in to create a slender, graceful, feminine, yet strong look, much like the one Marisa Tomei sports on the cover. I always feel great in my body the day after I do this workout, and that alone is priceless.

I've been able to stick with this a lot longer than other things I've done in the past, and I really feel like there is nothing better out there. If you want beautiful, yet slim curves, this DVD is the way to get them, period. Enjoy!

PS: These comments refer to the 20-odd-minute ""Body Definition"" main workout. It's the only one I do/have done, and it's the one Marisa says she does daily, too. The DVD also includes a leg-focused workout and a ten minute express workout; I don't know how these are, but the first workout alone is worth the price of the DVD and more!",1306108800,9,2054,4.543243243243243
4043046,4,B00308BAYO,"I liked this workout and the video.  I found it a refreshing take on fitness instruction.  It's almost as if you're in the room with Marisa and together you are being instructed by Key Son.  However, this is not a workout for beginners.  I'm a novice exerciser and just started not too long ago (a little more than a month ago).  I don't yet have the strength to keep up with this but I liked it enough to want to bring it back out when I do.  If you're just beginning, look for other titles before trying this one but don't forget about it!",1305936000,2,541,4.153846153846154
4043047,4,B00308BAYO,"Let it be the ab section. I can't speak much about the entire workout dvd, because I haven't done it. But I have watched the entire dvd and saw the moves to the ab section in the workout and decided to give it a go on my own a couple of nights later (I remembered the exercises and used the toning band like she did). Let me tell you something, Marisa Tomei lied to me as she's lied to many I presume. The woman didn't even break a sweat, and so here I'm thinking, ""easy peasy!"" Boy was I wrong. I'm not new to ab exercises. I've done plenty in my day, but I could only bust out with a couple of hers. The ones with the twist, I was like well ok, that looks nice. I could barely do one correctly, and the twist motion is much harder to accomplish than it looks. The whole ab section took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting it to be murder. I did them without watching the video, so I gave up easily, but I have a thing where if I'm watching a video I have to follow through with it regardless of the pain. I almost died doing few I did (I haven't worked out in two weeks, I've been sick and sloth-ish) , I don't want to think about having to follow through with the whole section once I follow along to the video. I can imagine it's pure murder. I can't say what the rest of the workout is like, but I can say that the ab section alone is worth it. PLUS the toning band. I've found that using that for those ab exercises definitely amplifies the benefits of the exercises. It makes it that much more difficult, which is great because I don't like getting bored, especially with the ab exercises, I need to switch it up or my muscles get used to it and it stops working. ALSO, one note on the warm up to her workouts. She has three workouts, total body, legs and 10-min and the warm up is the same for all. I'm not a fan of her warm up. There's very little warming up, if any at all. She stretches her muscles, which I've read and heard on numerous occasions is something you shouldn't do. I don't mind because I always do my own warm-up anyway, but if you're someone who is new to exercising, you may want to be careful with her warm up and just do your own. I'm just voicing this based on what I've read, have been told by professionals, etc. If you feel otherwise, that's fine too. Anyway, I would recommend using her warm-up as a cool down/stretch (but also add extra stretching, it's very important to prevent injuries and hers is very short and not very thorough). Other than that, I'd say I love this video, even if it's just for the abs.

Once I workout to the video in its entirety, I'll let you know what I think, add some comments or change the rating.",1297209600,3,2662,4.119230769230769
4043048,2,B00308BAYO,I love Marisa but was dissapointed by this video.  The sections were repetitive and I felt like the video was very easy. I prefer to be challenged more.,1296086400,2,152,4.428571428571429
4043049,3,B00308BAYO,"The main goals of these workouts seem to be improving balance and toning leg muscles with high reps, especially the underworked ones, but there is also an intense ab routine. This makes for an original set of workouts with a lot of moves that I'd never seen before.

However, there are several issues: the most glaring one is that Marisa's and Key's personalities don't blend well. Marisa tries to be upbeat and friendly (""I only have ten minutes to get to my party, Key""), but it seems awkward because Key usually ignores this and is always business-like. He also keeps trying to keep the pace and intensity up, while Marisa will occasionally stop for a small stretch. I don't mind either of these approaches, but they don't work well together. Fortunately, Marisa leads the short warm-up and cool-down by herself - but you should know that they are the same for all the workouts and her cueing needs some work. Some of the exercises and a lot of the pointers (""I try to focus on one spot to help with my balance"") are repeated, but this doesn't bother me too much. The abs are really only worked once, but yikes! It's 100 crunches with raised legs - too intense for me, not to mention boring. Also they don't ""flow seemlessly"" as the intro implies; the transitions aren't awkward, but gaiam shouldn't be marketing something just because it's in vogue.

The big problems of the routines themselves are the ""speed and agility"" drills and the focus on the muscles right above the knee. There are at least 5 moves (all with rather high reps) devoted to this area. I understand that they are underworked muscles that most workouts ignore, but this is excessive. The cardio segments are way too short to be considered intervals, I think they are used to get the heart rate back up after using such small muscles groups. They also require a lot of space and sometimes you have to go backwards which can be dangerous in a small or messy room. I usually just do jumping jacks or jog in place, instead.

Despite all my complaints, I do like this workout because although the muscles are worked intensely, the atmosphere is not intense at all, so I come out of it feeling very relaxed.",1294876800,5,2176,4.603092783505154
4043050,5,B00308BAYO,"I had been eyeing this dvd for a while before I purchased it, first looking at clips of the dvd and then deciding it looked like something I would like to throw into my rotation.

There are many things I liked about this dvd.  Marisa Tomei is not some dolled up celeb in perfect make-up and hair in her brand new outfit exercising.  She looks like someone that actually exercises, she is not wearing a ton of make-up and is wearing clothes that I would wear to work-out.  I already felt a connection.  The dvd contains three work-outs, one for body definition, which I thought was the hardest, due to doing a gizillion (well maybe a little less than that)sit-ups that are made more difficult by also working your legs with the small toning band included in the dvd.  Many of the movements were small for the legs...Ha, I thought, I work out every day, this will do nothing.  Yeah, I thought that until the afternoon when I was trying to figure out why the muscles in my legs were a little sore....oh yeah, the tiny little exercises.  Hmmmm, who knew?  This section took 20 minutes.  The next section was Best Legs and was 15 minutes and you work your legs and posture.  Ten Moves in Ten is a quick sculpting segment doing 10 exercises in 10 minutes.  This section would be nice to throw in on days where you wanted a little toning but did some walking or another form of exercise or you just were very short on time.

The instructor Key Son was very good, he is a calming, focused presence who points out the form and how it should look.  The cuing is excellent and he is great at describing what each exercise is targeting.

The one drawback I saw was that I have a SMALL livingroom.  This means some of the exercises where you do the shufflesteps across the floor had to be modified so that I did more repetitions back and forth and same thing with the walking with the bands, I had to turn quicker because space was an issue.  As far as this making the dvd any less effective it doesn't, so I don't really consider that a huge deal.

I would definitely seek out more dvd's that feature Marisa & Key Son.  Overall, this is a great toning dvd that can be done in separate segments as well as together if you don't mind a little repetition on some of the moves.",1294444800,8,2261,4.327790973871734
4043051,1,B00308BAYO,"Watched this DVD once and will never use it again.  First it is a big fuzzy - a technical issue perhaps.  But more importantly Marisa is annoying as an exercise instructor. She keeps asking her trainer stupid questions (which I suppose are aimed at educating the viewer on how certain exercises should be performed, but it gets old after a while).  The trainer is incredibly focused on a very specific small muscle above the knee and cannot stop talking about it.  Personally, I don't have issues with flabby knees and it was a bit odd to pay so much attention to this body part at the expense of others.
Many exercises require you to go across the floor and presuppose that you are working out in a studio that's much larger than eg my living room.
The DVD says you can play all three workouts together for a smooth combined workout.  Not so - the exercises are very repetitive and it makes no sense to do the combined workout unless you like doing the same thing over and over again and hearing about that knee muscle 10 times.
I absolutely hate this program and would give it zero stars if I could.  I was planning to buy her hooping workout but after this one, no way.",1292630400,11,1172,4.402777777777778
4043052,5,B00308BAYO,"Simple, effective, fun and entertaining.  I was not sure when I bought this DVD but I love it now.

4043053,5,B00308BAYO,"Ok, I'm a guy and you might think I bought this DVD for less than legit reasons, (and I might have) but this truly is my favorite workout DVD. I love the Billy Blanks workouts, but most of the total body ones are LONG (around an hour), require shoes, a mat, and a lot of space, and are so difficult they're kind of offputting.

But this DVD gets the balance right between effectiveness and enjoyability - the workouts are as short as 10 minutes, but they still feel challenging. You don't need much space at all, you're actually encouraged to go barefoot, it works on hardwood OR carpet just fine, and the little resistance band you get inside is fantastic.

Tomei is a likable host, and her chemistry (or lack thereof) with instructor Son is amusing. (she makes a little joke, he doesn't laugh, rinse and repeat - it's actually kind of charming when you watch it)

Bottom line is this is a fun little workout that you'll actually WANT to do. I can't recommend it highly enough!",1291248000,8,978,4.48314606741573
4043054,4,B00308BAYO,"i did this video for the first time yesterday and i am definitely feeling it today! especially in my hamstrings, inner thighs and abs. the workout is fairly simple, but definitely effective. the ab section in the ""body definition"" workout is really challenging. i certainly could not do all of the sit-ups, but i think that's a good thing because it means i won't outgrow the video quickly.

both marisa tomei and the instructor are very calm and relaxed during the whole workout. the instructor never talks to the camera or user and instead just instructs marisa. there is not that real ""you can do it!"" pump up factor that i have seen in most other workout videos, which is fine, especially since that can get old the 5th time or so watching the workout. one thing i did not like is that the instructor does not count out loud and i noticed some discrepancies between how many reps he said we were going to do and how many we actually do. for me, this is a draw back. i like to know exactly how many reps i am doing and how many i have left.

the toning band definitely helps make the workout more challenging and it mixes things up a bit, too, which is nice. i also like that you can combine the workouts or do them separately. marisa is relatable, shows great form and asks a lot of questions to clarify the moves for viewers at home. she is clearly in awesome shape, which is great motivation!

also, the workout is possible to do with little space. i have a tiny apartment and was able to do this workout just fine. there are some cardio sections that i had to adapt to my small space, but overall, it's definitely do-able if space is tight.",1289088000,3,1647,4.358306188925082

It's very easy to follow and the exercises target my core in a way I never do. The main workout is only 20 minutes, so for more athletic people you have to repeat the workout a couple of times (as she suggests).  I also really love following her, it's like working out with a friend.",1288310400,2,430,4.283950617283951

4043057,4,B00308BAYO,I am overweight due to a recurrent knee injury. This workout has been great for me b/c it doesn't involved deep lunges and squats or a lot of prolonged kneeling positions - moves I cannot currently do w/o further injury. I've only done it a few times but I already feel stronger and my legs feel tighter. The abs section is murder!

4043059,5,B00308BAYO,"I love this set of three, short workouts. I alternate them six days per week as an add-on to my daily 25-35 minute yoga practice and rebounding routine.  The moves are low-impact, inventive and effective.  I am a short gal and it is very easy for me to bulk up.  The exercises in this dvd tone and strengthen without creating a thicker thigh.  I love the moves that utilize the toning band and the ab section included in the longest workout is a killer!  All you need is a mat and the included toning band.  (I do wish that it was easier to find a replacement band that is the same size.  Mine is starting to show some wear.)  Marisa is very likable and low-key.  She wears the type of clothes I wear to workout (sweat shorts and a tank).  The stretching segments are quick and feel great. The music is nice and the instructor is very clear on form.  I love that when I'm pressed for time I can still get in a great routine in ten minutes.  All three workouts are great! Highly recommended!",1282348800,3,990,4.263440860215054
4043060,3,B00308BAYO,"While parts of the video are a little challenging, I have a few concerns.  The energy bursts (shuffles and whatnot) require a lot of room.  She uses a good portion of the empty room they are filming in and I just don't have that kind of room so I had to break it down into multiple trips across my living room floor instead of one each way.

I spent years working in physical therapy and, unfortunately, have the beginning stages of carpal tunnel syndrome.  A portion of the ab section requires a fully extended plank position which is really hard on my wrists.  I have been able to modify and do the plank on my elbows but doing the exercises in that position eliminates some room and it becomes a little bit tricky. It is possible though so it's something for people who have wrist issues to consider trying if they want to purchase this DVD.

I didn't really find any of the leg exercises to be all that challenging which was a slight disappointment and I was a little bummed that the exercises weren't previewed before she did them.  My favorite celebrity/trainer videos are the Cindy Crawford ones from well over a decade ago.  In those, she shows you what she's going to do before doing it.  I didn't have any problems figuring out what Marisa was doing, but in comparing it to what I already have, this DVD failed a little regarding that aspect.

The band is a nice touch.  It's something that can be used with other videos and something that is always nice to have as part of any home gym, I just wish it was a tad bit longer.

Marisa is easy to relate to and she has great form.  What's also nice is that you can hear that she is struggling just a little bit when she speaks, which is so much better than some of the other videos where people are super happy and not at all out of breath after doing the exercises.

Overall, it's a pretty good video if you don't have any wrist issues, but because I do, I had to give it a 3/4.  It would have gotten a 4/5 if I was challenged more by the leg workouts or if I didn't have to modify the ab section at all.  People with lower back problems might have a few issues.  There is a lower ab/lower ab oblique section with leg raises and leg raises with twists that will probably cause LBP sufferers some pain so, again, modifications may need to be made for them to do the routines, but it can be done.",1277769600,12,2352,4.249438202247191

I work full time and I am also a full time mom so I can't do workout sessions lasting 40-60 minutes.  I am always looking for new 20 minutes workouts to try and that was the main selling point for me.  I love this workout because it's calm and not jumping and yelling all over the place.  Some of the movements are so small you are wondering how it could possibly work but they do if you do them right.  You need to keep that tummy tight and make every move count.  I am with the others that say she does hundreds of crunches because I can't quite keep up yet.  I am on day 2 and so sore in my upper thighs and abdominals.

I'm a mom of 2 babies under 4, so time is a big issue, these 3 workouts are very short but EFFECTIVE! a great thing is you don't even need sneakers on, a plus for me that I'm hanging out in my pj shorts for most of the day chasing after the kids

First, during the warm up, it is just Marisa sitting and stretching silently with her voice recorded over it. Kind of a strange vibe that she isn't just talking as she's stretching.

Then when the workout actually starts, it is basically a trainer standing in a studio telling Ms. Tomei what moves to do. Their dynamic was just odd - she kept looking at him hesitantly, asking if she was doing the moves correctly. She almost seemed uncomfortable around him, not at all like she'd trained with him before.

I can't comment much on the effectiveness of the workout as the DVD stopped working. But honestly I didn't like what I had seen so I wouldn't have finished it anyway. I do a lot of free YouTube workouts instead for free.",1471910400,,933,4.381502890173411
