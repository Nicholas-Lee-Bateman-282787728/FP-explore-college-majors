forget about daily troubles we know that we can watch a show that has honesty, values, morales and old-fashioned fun in each episode. This is quite refreshing in today's world. Would that more people would watch ... and LEARN!!

4470480,5,B004USNHWG,"I now have all seasons of ""Father Knows Best"".  I feel better that I paid the exorbitant price to someone else besides Shout Factory.  I saved a couple of bucks on shipping, too.  I HATE Shout Factory for supposedly making this available only through them with the outrageous price of $39.99 PLUS shipping.

This was my least favorite of all the seasons, but there are a few very good episodes, and I really enjoy the ""Window On Main Street"" show that is included in the entire collection.",1309910400,4,489,4.586206896551724
4470481,5,B004USNHWG,"Always loved this show - all 6 seasons never disappointed me with their quality.
While Donna Reed was a good show, it was mostly fluff, while FKB always delivered a good and worthwhile message to learn.

4470482,5,B004USNHWG,"Father Knows Best is by far my all-time favorite TV series.  Each episode was entwined with a lesson to everyone, not just the young.  The Anderson family mirrored my 5-member family as we grew up in the 50s and 60s, however we lived in the South.  I wish there were more seasons because I would definitely purchase the DVDs... oh well, we can only wish our young people these values in the days ahead.  By the way, every DVD I have purchased through Amazon has been in excellent (new) condition.

4470484,5,B004USNHWG,"This afternoon I finally finished watching all of the FKB releases, and they are well worth your time, attention, and dollars.  I began with season 3 and 4, then went back to 1 and 2, then on to 5 and 6.  And I'm glad I did it in that order -- the first two seasons are kind of ""finding their way"", and it was somewhere midway through season 2 where they figured out what they wanted the series to be.  In my view, FKB, without a laugh track, would be considered to be basically a drama series, with a few laughs along the way.  Many of the episodes are very serious about kids growing up.  And the idea often expressed that this was a too perfect family...well, I don't agree.  Bud was selfish, often rude and inconsiderate, and had little common sense.  Betty was an overachiver.  And, Cathy was a whiner.  Sounds like some families I knew.  Yes, Mom and Dad were probably the best parents one could hope for...but even they sometimes realized their failures -- it is surprising over the course of the series how often they told their children they were ""ashamed"" of them.  In other words, what I am saying is -- this is real life, with a little humor thrown in.  Around 200 episodes, and I enjoyed virtually every one of them.  There are few series from the past or the present that I can say that about.  Highest recommendation, and heads above Ozzie and Harriet or the Cleavers -- those were JUST situation comedies.  FKB is the gold standard.",1305244800,20,1448,4.411320754716981
4470485,5,B004USNHWG,"With this season of 32 episodes, the Father Knows Best series called it a day.  It's too bad because it probably could have gone on for another year or two.  But Robert Young and Jane Wyatt were tired (she one referred to this season as ""sheer hell"").  but there are exceptional shows.  One is ""Betty's Double,"" where Elinore Donahue as Betty wins a look-alike contest based on her resemblance to Donna Stewart, also played by Donahue.  She finds Hollywood to be shallow and cruel (Isn't it funny how Hollywood always portrays ""Hollywood"" as a vacant, distant entity?).  Another good one, funny to be sure is ""Togetherness,"" where a reporter is assigned to profile the Anderson clan.  The results are predictable, but hilarious.  As usual, Billy Gray as Bud shines in every episode that's centered around him.  The best being ""Bud Lives It Up,"" where he goes a little crazy by overspending on a college trip.  Consequences abound.  Gray was better than Tony Dow of Leave It to Beaver, or Paul Peterson of the Donna Reed Show, as an actor that is.  A very, very natural actor.  Truly gifted.  I was really amazed that he didn't go further in his career after FKB went off the air in 1960.  The shows all have the original beginning music for season 6, and the correct season 6 ending music on a handful of shows. Bonus features (NO REUNION MOVIES from 1977!!!) two shows from Robert Young's next show, Window on Main Street.  No captioning.  There aren't too many shows from the 50s that have all the episodes released on DVD.  I think I love Lucy and The Honeymooners are the only others, but this show is a gem.  Classy, well-written and very heartwarming.  Buy it!",1304467200,22,1666,4.640410958904109

4470499,5,B004USNHWG,"I started watching these when I got a few Season 1 discs from Netflix to share with my elderly aunt at her request.  I was sure I was *much* too sophisticated for such sophomoric stuff, but the more I watched, the more I liked.  This is a surprisingly versatile, remarkably talented ensemble cast, the members of which work very well together.  Yes, it's wholesome (what used to be called ""in good taste"" before good taste became a bad thing) but Billy Gray (""Bud Anderson"") does a terrific smart-*ss who adds an edge the others play off of.  I've become a huge fan of Jane Wyatt (see her Wikipedia biography for some surprises).  I used to think of Robert Young as just ""that Sanka commercial guy"" and had really no exposure to Elinor Donahue or Lauren Chapin before I started watching, but all these people could *act*.  Start at Season 1 if you've not seen this and want a taste - you can get it on Amazon or rent it on Netflix.  It just gets better from there.  Mr. Young apparently pulled the plug after ~7 seasons when they were at the top of their game and everybody wanted more, but he was probably right to let it go then.  You won't regret time or a few bucks spent on this show.",1442275200,6,1189,4.343891402714932

4470515,5,B004USNHWG,We Really enjoy our B&W TV series. I won't even comment on whether it is realistic...that's not the point! It's just good clean fun!!,1386720000,,133,4.583333333333333
4470516,5,B004USNHWG,"Unfortunately, this was the last year (1960) that new episodes of FKB were produced.  It was so popular with the public, that reruns were shown in PRIMETIME through 1963.

This last year has some of the finest, and most moving episodes, of all the years.

In an era where TV show represented fathers as clowns, mothers as opionionless servants and children as stereotypical robots, with all families as white and no home having a bathroom, ha; Father Knows Best daringly broke out of the mold and and presented American families of the time (and even to a degree now) with an attempt at realism that we did not often see.

It addresses issues, that other shows dared not approach, and would not have been permitted to by networks in the lates fifties and sixties. For example, in one episode a Caucasian family adopts a Korean boy.  This family submits a picture and wins a contest for the ideal happy American family.  With the moral being that the typical U.S. family does not have to be of a homogeneous race and white.  Almost unbelievable that this flew under the radar of the censors of the day.

In another episode, ""Fronk"" the Mexican garderner was selected to present an award to the mayor.  However, city officials were doing everything in their power to prevent this, due to Frank's race and economic (lower) class.  However, Jim forces the issue and Fronk  presents the award.  Moral being that race, color and class are irrelevant as we are all citizens of the U.S.  As usual the writers and directors of FTB knew how to sneak  by the bigotry of the network brass of the day.  Morals were presented to the audience that just weren't getting out there in other shows.

In an earlier season, a girl from India (actually portrayed by Rita Moreno of latin descent) stays with the Andersons and even sleeps in the same bedroom as Betty.  In the fifties dark skinned individuals were rarely even seen on television, let alone staying in the home and even the same bedroom as white people.  Had Father Knows Best stayed on the air, I would bet anything it would have been the first television show to have a African-American in an episode.  At the time, the censors would have nixed the episode unless the black person were a servant (As in the Danny Thomas Show) or a buffoon (as in Amos and Andy).

There was never a show on television that did such an accurate representation of middle class working America.  The dialogue was realistic (right on target actually) and many of the situations that the episodes were built around were almost (unbelievably)identical with ones that my own family had while I was growing up in the fifties and early sixties.

Yes, there occasionally was some farce, after all it was a comedy TV show made to entertain.  But any show that still holds up for sixty years, has something going for it.  Look at today's sitcoms.  No semblance of reality whatsoever.  Actors (if you can call them that) stand around and throw each other smart-alec one liners.  With the writers doing nothing more than trying to get cheap laughs.

There is no connections with the way people really interact.  Now yes, there are some shows that are exceptions.  But with FKB, maybe not every episode hit it right off with a totally plausible situation.  But even then you didn't have too stretch your imagination too far.  And the interaction and diaglogue between the characters was realistic and caught the true dynamics of a family.  With fights, jealously, greed and sibling rivalry being honestly portrayed.  Maybe someone lives in a totally dysfunctional family, or has diovrced parents or lives with realtives or is homeless.  Well Father Knows Best was not about that.  It was written about a middle class family that wasn't totally dusfunctional or had drunk parents or divorced parents.  That just wasn't what is was supposed to be about.

For those people in situations like that, FTB was a role model or mentor, that showed that there are people in this world who are not dysfunction.  And it shows the viewer, that yes.  There are times when we can work out our problems with each other.  Sometimes by compromising, even when we don't want to.  Most of all the show told us there is a consequence to our actions.  Even thought none of us want there to be. It shows us there can be another way. At least something to strive for.

I had once email one of the actors of FTW, Billy Gray, who portrayed Bud.  He is quite proud of his work on FTW (as well as in Day the Earth Stood Still.), as well he should be!  He is an impecable actor.  HIs life was not exactly typical middle class American, and he has had some very unfortunate events in his personal life.  Yet due to his great prowess as an actor he is able to very convincingly portray the character of Bud in Father Knows Best. (BTW, Billy is a expert and award winning motorcycle racer today).

All of the actors in FKB are to be commended for their abilities in realistic acting that has stood the test of time as has the show itself.

By all means, buy this, and all of the seasons of Father Knows Best.  They are the ""Feel Good"" winners of American television!",1379808000,16,5145,4.605060506050605
