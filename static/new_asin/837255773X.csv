The essay on time, perception, media, memory and human destiny (""Sans soleil"") and the poetic modernist SF (""La jetee""-that was, as you probably know, liberally remade by Terry Gilliam in ""12 monkeys"") are among the masterpieces of modernist cinema, not to be missed by any serious film buff.
""La jetee"" is famous for its montage of stills, non-moving photographs, but viewers beware; not every shot is a still and this small deviation you should discover is just one example of Marker's subtlety.",1151193600,4,686,4.973913043478261
1171036,5,837255773X,"I saw Sans Soleil in an art film class I took a year or so ago. I had no idea what to expect, and I was totally enthralled. I scoured the internet for a copy of the film on DVD, and finally did find a bootleg copy somewhere. It remains my favorite film experience ever, and each time I watch it I make new connections and realize another idea the film is suggesting. Before I proceed, let me note that the film is neither fiction nor traditional documentary, but is an ""essay film,"" meaning a voiceover provides the only dialogue throughout the 2+ hours of the film, which may try the patience of a great many viewers.

This film has an incredible tone to it, a somber elegance with a hint of melancholy which is nested in the voice over, which is, again, the single element giving structure to what would otherwise look like a jumbled stretch of filmic field recordings. The voiceover, which is credited as letters from the filmmaker's friend, but which is actually a script the filmmaker wrote as if his friend had written him said letters, is itself a beautiful and haunting reflection on time and memory, of the failure of creation to overcome the march of time. So in a way, it castigates itself to failure. (This is one reading, it also contains Marker's signature postcolonial criticism, etc., etc.) The voice also seems to operate at a kind of remove, since Marker wrote the dialogue years after he shot all the disparate footage, which almost makes it feel as though we're listening to the notes some deity has transcribed while watching the feeble human race go about its business.

This said, I believe the film does have to be experienced in a certain setting, or with a certain mindset. It's best in exhibition, or when watched alone. I tried showing it to a friend in my apartment, and I could feel that something wasn't right, that he wasn't going to get as much out of it as I would. And perhaps you have to be some specific type of person to really love this film, though I have no idea what this type of person would be.",1133481600,5,2038,4.475806451612903

1171052,5,837255773X,"La Jetee is one of the best Sci Fi films I've ever seen. I would highly recommend watching it on a big screen for your first viewing (although chances are if you know of this film it wouldn't be your first). The film is highly artistic and beautifully composed. To gain the full effect of the film, it is important for a larger format to ""take in"" the full spectacle. If you're not big into Sci Fi this may be a nice artistic intro into the genre that may not scare you away. The film is originally filmed in french. I would have preferred to have watched it in french with english subtitles, but the subtitles that the criterion collection chose to use are horrible and unreadable, so I had to opt for english dubbed, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

As for Sans Soleil, this movie is another very artistic film. It is almost a birds eye view on humanity, human nature, and society at large. It is very interesting and worth the watch. It does contain some graphic material that is not recommended for all ages (La Jetee would be safe for a younger audience).

Overall I very much enjoy these films, but I would say that the criterion collection did a major dis-service by their poor choice in subtitles. I give the movies 5 stars, I give the collection 3 stars.",1396224000,,1277,4.361344537815126
1171053,5,837255773X,"Then you must enjoy yourself while watching Chris Marker's work. This Criterion DVD set is fantastic--the booklet, a fun, interesting combination of Marker's own thoughts, critical pieces, and cultural context writings, all aid the viewer in understanding the rich, literary, and deeply photographic background of Marker's visionary work. What a shame that such a powerful filmmaker has been placed into such obscure positions for us historians. I mean, Marker might not have considered himself a visionary of great significance, but this new Criterion DVD sets the record straight. (Not that it's important, but Marker considered the vision of Terry Gilliam and complimented him for making a redo of ""The Jetty""--I, personally, could not make it through half of the movie ""12 Monkeys"", as my brain was becoming fried from the lack of interesting scenes, characters, or situations on display, but then I'm not a Bruce Willis fan either). ""The Jetty"" is one of the best short futuristic films ever, and this is not hyperbole. I found the film to be genuinely enriching. I also enjoyed the story. Marker proves here that he understood what film is supposed to do, as a medium, and this record of his thinking at that time is more than welcome for those of us who truly love cinema history. He is not caught up in ignorant star-making films; his works genuinely have perspective, and a point. ""Sunless"" is one of the most beautiful cinematic adventures in all of world cinema, and it is presented here on a pristine print that genuinely shows the color, technique, and pacing that Marker wanted to preserve. This narrative journey through the imaginary letters of a documentary cameraman is a prime example of what cinema should do in its understanding of human empathy, cinematography, and technical detail. If you didn't get it the first time, watch it again...I promise it will be one of the most rewarding movie experiences that you will have. There is never a dull moment in this sensitively written, beautifully photographed experience. Outside of seeing great documentaries on butterflies or other animals (such as the sometimes painful but always great ""The Last Lions""), Marker's ""Sunless"" is one the more moving cinematic journeys of my recent viewing memory.
My only complaint about the set is that it did not include a copy of Marker's short documentary film entitled ""Statues also Die""--it's about as important a film as one can find on the transition of tribal 'primitive culture' art into newer colonial ""understandings"" that one can find, and it's essential for understanding how Marker viewed the history of art as well. But, other than that quibble, Criterion has done right to the legacy of the always elusive Chris Marker; several great (if brief) documentary pieces are here, and you just have to watch them all if you are interested. There's a lot of goodies on this disc. Overall, one of the best purchases you can make if you are interested in the idea of Cinema. A+",1390521600,2,2987,5.0

1171056,4,837255773X,"""The entire city is a comic strip.""

In a time like our own, with crowds screaming for stimulation and fast paces, it is easy to forget the basis of what makes film something beautiful. Yes, the general consensus will invoke musical scores, acting performances and cinematography to the table, but what about the core of the film? Images and what lies behind them. The naked-eye will see something, but what that image generates for the senses is something much more powerful than the simple action of seeing. Chris Marker in his film `Sans Soleil` challenges us to see beyond the image or the narration and to feel the world through cinema.

Marker combines the footage of fictional, continental-hopping Sandor Krasna, a cinematographer who shot hours upon hours of imagery from Japan, Africa, Europe and more. To punctuate what is being shown to us is the narative read by a nameless woman who is assumed to be one of Sandor's closest friends, maybe even intimately. She reads from letter's he has written, giving the viewer perspective as to what is happening...or in other words we are given context. It's precise, it's colorful and even sometimes humorous and sad, but is it real?

Arguably, it could be said that most of the information we are given is part of the fiction. But what is the mind to do with images that are real but words that are not? In this sense, Marker points out a very deceiving aspect of how we humans live our lives and that is our tendency to associate image with sound, or any other combination of the senses for that matter. It is simple to believe that when a grown man is crying at a ceremony that it is out of pride and joy, but when the letter states otherwise - that it is out of anger - we are quick to believe and to re-evaluate our position based on that information. Our initial reaction is contaminated and we doubt what our eyes first showed us...even worse, we reject it and accept the new development.

While the documentary-like film jumps around the world with ease, it is usually drawn back to Japan, a world were imagery and cultural rituals both become the life of all people there but also the walls that blind them. From Krasna's view, it seems so incredible that a culture can be so divided in terms of social life, hobbies, religion, trends and so for, that the chaos somehow merges into one of the most beautiful image of all. This culture, mind you, that is somehow sandwiched between Eastern traditionalism and Western modernism. Coincidence? I think not.

There is a train of thought that does not escape notice somewhere toward the end of the first section of film. Krasna tells of spending an entire day watching television and of the slow `death' of Japanese programming as time passes by, a death that is replaced by European entertainment and finally ended in the night by erotic programs, a slow transition into Western culturalism, stimulation done in the manner of conquest. The following scene depicts the display of catholic history and artifacts in a museum in Tokyo, a step taken by Europe to take further hold of Eastern society now that the field has been sown by media and sex appeal.

There is a whole book worth of exploration to be made about each couple of minutes of this film, but the ideas have been planted early and we can really now begin to wonder about the realities of image and sound, and how it is that they relate to memory and perception. Krasna delivers to the audience his intention for the film he will someday create, the science-fiction masterpiece where a man travels back to us from the year four-thousand-one in search of what memories were to us, but he is expelled into an incoherent timeline and jumps from one non-associated even to the next. To the future of the human race, today is memory, but are we able to perceive the truth of what we are living even though our ability to interpret what we see, what we hear, what we feel is completely compromised by our surroundings, by culture, by politics, and by family? There are wars, and disasters and suffering in the world, but all we ""see are the girls in kimonos."" Or in other words, all we see are the images at the forefront of our naked-eye.

Krasna begins and end the film with what he believes is the perfect image, the embodiment of happiness. Three children playing on a road in Iceland. The screen then goes black and the statement is made, ""if they don't see the happiness there, at least they'll see the black."" A warning and a guidepost for all the viewers of the film. He tells us right here to look with something other than our eyes, something that will allow us to fully take in this image and what it symbolizes about perfection. Children and their ability to enchanted. Their ability to fall in love with the images of the world. The purety. In the case of this image, the unity and opportunity to love one another while having the potential of being completely different down the road that they travel. And the journey along that long road, all the possibilities that lie at the end of it.

Sans Soleil can be watched as a documentary and taken at face value, but you might as well pause the film on the black screen and leave it there. The idea that you are directed toward a certain vision of a person or even simply because you are told something while your eyes deny it is simply disconcerting and truly makes you think twice about how it is life is to be experienced. Also, it returns us to the eternal question of whether we are capable of ever putting ourselves in somebody else's position. It is a simple thing to look at ourselves in the mirror and then point the finger, laughing at the drunk Japanese man directing traffic. Are the images we place before our own eyes any more relevant or are they the wall that prevents us from seeing further, from moving forward as a person, as a society? Why not allow ourselves to trust in our own senses, to choose for ourselves what the images mean? Maybe we'll discover that the inconsistencies of life were really only pleasant surprises.

For example, ""did you know that there are Emus in the Ile-de-France?""",1370563200,,6136,4.591240875912408
1171067,5,837255773X,"When I saw the film La Jetee, which investigates time and memory in detail, I immediately thought of a black and white art house French film released in 1962 named Last Year at Marienbad, which was directed by Alain Resnais and based on a novel written in French by Alain Robbe-Grillet. I read the novel in my French class at the University of Illinois and now have the film released by Criterion on blu-ray.
The film Sans Soleil has the same obsession with time and memory as La Jetee, but focuses on Japan. In 1960 Resnais released the film Hiroshima Mon Amour, which was filmed in Japan.
I like both Chris Marker films and, although there are some similarities with the Resnais films, I would definitely not accuse him of plagiarism. I think both sets stand on their own. It is also possible,but unlikely, that he never saw the Resnais films. My five star rating still stands. I will continue to watch the Resnais and Marker films beginning with A Grin Without a Cat, which is next in line for me, and any new Marker films that are released.
Finally, I am hereby disclosing that I do have a tortoise-shell cat named Monkey, who figures prominently in some of my reviews.  I may let her do the next review and possibly all the rest just as soon as she can learn to type on a computer keyboard. If her typing is illegible, I may have to translate for her and send her to night school at Sacramento City College. I am sure she will pass all her courses with straight A's(Torties are very smart). I may allow her to translate all my reviews into Meowish for all the felines who want to read them ( I hope AMZ gives her some space for her reviews or we might have to sue based on speciesism and/or genderism).",1368144000,,1707,4.401898734177215
1171068,5,837255773X,"This is the film that inspired Terry Gilliam to create ""12 Monkeys"".

1171069,3,837255773X,"This is a hard DVD to review, especially because there are two very different films included.  The first is a set of very creative black and white stills combined to tell an interesting sci-fi story that is basically a study of the workings of memory.  The still shots show a lot of artistry.  The story itself ends in a way that seems too clever and familiar so that was disappointing.  The second film is a color documentary-style exploration of memory again.  It takes a much broader view and includes events in Africa and Japan, exploring aspects of history and culture and art.  Again, the use of artistic photography is the best part - although it is in motion rather than stills, some shots are ""held"" to give the impression of a still shot and those are extremely good, reminding me of the great Japanese film maker Ozu.  Unfortunately, there is too much boring narration in this film.  There is also too much bizarre photography - of animal sexuality and the horrific killing of a giraffe.  I saw some of this film on PBS and believe these shots were cut, so they evidently aren't necessary, assuming the film maker gave his permission.  I know there are other film makers who include such things but for some people they spoil the film.

From a horrible VHS bootleg to the first volume of The Short Cinema Journal to the Criterion DVD and, finally, the blu-ray. What a journey. This is indeed the ""perfect "" copy. However, with the increased resolution I find the slight waver of the images to be a bit distracting. Yea, I'm splitting hairs; I'm sure this is inherent in the original elements. Seems to me that with digital technology the frames could have been made truly static (after all, most of the film is made up of still photos). Aside from that, this is the one to own.

1171072,5,837255773X,"The first film is a dense little masterpiece in black and white without any budget nor special effects, or so few. A child sees something, some event he does not understand and the world is destroyed right after that. The child will survive and his memory with him. Years later he falls in the hands of a mad doctor who sends him in the past where he meets a woman and falls for her. Then the doctor sends him to the future and the man discovers the future is ready to accept them and that humanity has survived provided a few adaptations producing a world without any war, social problems and shortages. The traditional romantic idealism.

But one day the doctor sends him to the exact time of his recollection and he discovers that the child he was actually saw his own arrival there  and his getting shot on the spot. You can then more or less, according to your morbidity, reflect on the meaning of this event: an outsider from the future arrives and is killed on the spot. Not bad at all. But worse indeed is the fact that we must have reached the sixth dimension  since time works in both directions simultaneously and space is no longer in anyway two-dimensional and aging. Is that relativity the result of the fact we can look at any space and time from different points of view? The answer has to be positive of course. Post-modernism is the law. The present contains the future and is the future of the past it contains too.

The second film is the illustration of the letters of some traveler who travels a lot in Japan, some in Australia and from time to time in Africa, Guinea Bissau precisely. It is a film on rites and rituals having to do with life and death, trying to accommodate death so that we can survive a little bit more than expected. Life is always a survival and not an end in itself. This is very Buddhist but the filmmaker is trying to make it general.

The interest then when he speaks of the guerrilla warfare in Guinea Bissau is not the communist guerrilla warfare itself that will eventually turn socialist and then realist, but in fact the side remark that in Europe it brought the Portuguese fascist dictatorship down but that it also made the Europeans suddenly dream of a new revolution. It sure was a revolution (dedicated to carnations) in Portugal and then there was the post-Franco era in Spain, but the revolution was a dream in the corner of a narrow-minded communist leader in Portugal and very fast things went back to the democratic order and the soldiers went back to their barracks and let elections decide on who will be governing the country.

This is the real discourse of this second film, emphasized by the killing of a giraffe whose objective was nothing but the final and lethal bullet in its head since the repast, the banquet, the feast will be for a band of vultures. The discourse becomes general then. Life is always the result of death. Something has to die for something else to live, but if you try to force this historical movement, you produce quite a lot more death than life and anyway the vultures will come and put things back in place. It is the vision of Buddhist rites, prayers and meditation in parallel with the tranquil walk of some emus that represent the natural course of history and we do not have the right to get out of the lane: dangerous and useless.

The allusion to Hitchcock's film Vertigo is typical: the prey is in fact attracting the predator and the prey knows she/he is doing that, even if the chauvinistic predator considers he/she leads the game, from behind mind you as if the prey were on a leash, but when a farmer takes a pig to the market with a rope around its neck, who leads who? The farmer or the pig?

1171073,5,837255773X,"I am at a loss trying to describe my thoughts & feelings with this movie, as my mind struggles to grasp it in its full extent.

Perhaps the most important thing I can say about this movie is the very first thing that came into my mind the first time I saw it: pure inspiration.  Inspiration in all aspects of movie making.  I literally haven't come across anything similar on the silver screen (and/or my home cinema) and neither do I expect anyone to attempt a similar feat (because that's what it trully is).  Of course, there are a lot of directors and screen writers that are extremely inspired and whose inspired works we have enjoyed over the years.  I dare say though that this is in a league of its own.

The best way to enjoy this movie is to not know anything about it (like it was with me).  So, if you are reading hard all these reviews that contain information & analyses about the plot, you will get carried away before the movie even starts.  I think that this is a movie that gives itself to a lot of analysis and I am sure that many people will have attempted this - and for good reason.

As cool as ""La Jetee"" is, I'm going to focus on the ""other"" film on the disc. I was about to refer to Sans Soleil as a documentary, and now have changed my mind four times in the last five minutes.

This is a compliment. I get the most out of films that are so singular in their vision that assigning them to a genre, even one as broad as ""documentary,"" is an utterly pointless exercise (""The Falls"" would be another example). Generic terms like ""good,"" ""great,"" or ""greatest"" really don't apply. Is ""Sans Soleil"" good? Sure! Is it bad? Guess so. Compared to what? Exactly. Nothing comparable that I've seen exists. That fact alone means it stands out to me as an immensely rewarding viewing experience. As I said, I bought the dvd because of ""La Jetee"" and have ended up becoming much more passionate about ""Sans Soleil.""

I guess if I were running a video shop, I'd grudgingly file it under documentaries, but only because no existing genre seems to fit any better. Amazon lists it under ""Classic Sci-Fi & Fantasy"" (presumably because it's packaged with ""La Jetee"") and as part of (huh??) Jimmy Stewart's filmography. I assumed that was a mistake until I remembered the film's references to ""Vertigo."" Sci-fi and fantasy this film is surely not, but oddly that's nearly as apt a description as anything else.

Until enough films exist to populate a ""free-form, dreamlike film essay"" section, I guess we'll just have to accept that ""Sans Soleil,"" God bless it, ain't gonna fit in with the popular kids.

1171075,5,837255773X,"La jete (1961) aka The Pier is one of the best, poignant, and most unusual films ever made. The 28 minutes long collection of unbelievably rich, mesmerizing, still black and white images accompanied with the mourning score and sparse narration look inside your very soul while you look at them and they talk to you and reach to all your senses. This is correct - the film used a photo-montage technique but once stated watching, I was so enthralled that I did not think about technical part. The film is simple, poetic, philosophical, and profound. It is an anti war/post-apocalyptic science fiction documentary style and at the same time the ode to love, longing, and to power of memory. Here is the paradox - how can documentary, made of the still black and white images tell the story that would influence every following film about time travel and be the true feast for mind and soul? Well, it has happened in La jete, and while watching you forget what genre the movie belongs to because it defies the definitions of genres, and you just don't want it to end and you know that this movie will never have a happy ending. Like millions of fascinated viewers I ask how that much was achieved with so little. Like an unnamed protagonist of La jete is marked for life with an unforgettable image from his childhood, the viewer is marked with the still images of the film, especially by only one animated image of awakening in the film that comes like a miracle. I finished earlier this evening re-watching Terry Gilliam's excellent film Twelve Monkeys (1995) for which La Jetee was the inspiration. Now when I saw both, I am sure that if it were not for the unspeakably sad, beautiful and moving short film of Chris Marker that suggests that ""calling past and future may save the present"" and provides the extraordinary emotional impact with the story of return to the most vivid childhood memories again and again, there would be no brilliant and dark visions of Twelve Monkeys.

Not just limited to films, Marker is an accomplished writer, photographer, documentary maker and multimedia artist.  Not known for giving interviews or his picture being captured, if anything, we see only a picture of a cat.

Known for films such as ""Lettre de Sibrie"" (1957), ""Le Joli Mai"" (1963), ""A Grin Without a Cat"" (1977), ""AK"" (1985), ""Level Five"" (1997), Chris Marker is a director that has always challenged audiences and what better than to release two films that he is especially known for in a single DVD release from The Criterion Collection: ""La Jete"" (1962) and ""Sans Soleil"" (1983).

Two films that are very different from one another but both have their place in importance of works from Chris Marker.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""La Jete"" is a film featured in Black and White photo stills, while ""Sans Soleil"" was shot by Chris Marker with a silent camera.  Both films are presented in their original aspect ratios of 1:66:1.  According to the Criterion Collection, both films feature new high-definition digital transfers created on a Spirit 2K Datacine.  ""La Jete""was mastered from a 35mm fine-grain master positive and ""Sans Soleil"" was mastered from a 35mm interpositive.

Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

Audio is presented in monaural and is narrated for both films.  While ""Sans Soleil"" does feature sounds recorded by Chris Marker using a non-sync audio cassette recorder.  The soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from 35mm optical track prints and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The film is presented via the center channel but for those with modern home theater receivers and have multiple channels, can set their receiver for stereo on all channels.

To the delight of many fans of both films, both audio tracks (English and French) are included.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""La Jete/Sans Soleil"" contains the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""La Jete/Sans Soleil"" is definitely a fantastic release from the Criterion Collection for those who appreciate Chris Marker's worker or are curious about his work.

But it is one of those releases that you know in your heart that those who get it, can truly enjoy it.  Those who don't, may find it too cerebral for their tastes.  Even for myself, who enjoys cerebral films, I watched both in one sitting but realized that both will take repeated viewings, ""Sans Soleil"" I would need to take it in chapter by chapter because I find myself discovering something new with each viewing.

For ""La Jete"", many fans of Terry Gilliams ""12 Monkeys"" will appreciate where the director was able to come up with ideas which are literally concepts inspired from Marker's short film.  The film was groundbreaking as it told a sci-fi story without the use of video and primarily through still pictures and audio.  What I find so fascinating are the various essays found online dedicated to the short film.

People who were impacted by the short film in various ways as also shown from the special features on the DVD.  Considered as one of the greatest experimental films ever created, its hard to believe that a film utilizing still photos is able to capture suspense and mystery.

Needless to say, over 25 years later, since the premiere of ""La Jete"" I was able to utilize this form in my college project and needless to say, even a person like myself has been inspired by Chris Marker's work.

As for ""Sans Soleil"", similar to ""La Jete"", people come out of this film with different experiences.  Much different from the 1962 film, ""Sans Soleil"" is much more intellectually crafted.  The film focuses on the words of a fictional character, Krasna, a cameraman who has captured video and images in countries that are so different from each other.

In someways, this film is a time capsule of sorts as it captures life in Japan or Guinea-Bissau.  I feel as if Chris Marker's experience in Japan is much different than mine.  Where the landmarks still remain the same but technology has changed the landscape of the country.  Similar to Marker who remembers Japan from his memories, I view Japan through memories captured by my father back in 1973 and have since visited the country and have more or less embraced the technology.

What I find so interesting when watching ""Sans Soleil"" is how much things have changed in Japan but also how things have not changed.  Japan is still a country where many people continue to read manga, Akihabara is still an electronic city, horror films continue, sexuality is still showcased in many different forms and as it was in 1983, suicide is even more prevalent in today's Japan.  And as for Guinea-Bissau, I don't think much has changed for the people in terms of culture in the country since 1983.  The main difference is how technology has changed the landscape of livelihood, as it has affected other countries.  Where Guinea-Bissau and other countries where technology has not permeated into the livelihood of the people, life still remains the same.  So, in some ways, over 25-years later since the filming of ""Sans Soleil"", I would love to see Chris Marker to return and I would love to see what film he would be able to capture of today's modern Japan versus his experience from 1983 and the late 60's.

The film is just a collage of video that begs of you to question them and make you wonder what Chris Marker wanted the viewer to gain from it.  From the picture of three young children smiling in Iceland, to seeing the village being buried by volcanic ash.  Video of a museum in Japan dedicated to the penis and animals in sexual positions.  There are a wide variety of images that will capture your attention but the most shocking of ""Sans Soleil"" is when we see a giraffe getting shot.  A video image that you just don't see on any animal show and possibly an image that one just doesn't forget.  The video is not meant to be something important but merely a transition to another topic but yet, it's one transition that is one of the most talked about scenes of the film even 25 years later.

""San Soleil"" is a film that begs to ask those who have memories of a place and time but in someways, you can see the film as a film that possibly shows the change of society that Marker has come to accept and questions it.  The character of Krasna is constantly bringing up topics of memories and then we are taken to another level when the topic starts to talk about Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"".

Sound confusing?  Explaining ""Sans Soleil"" is not an easy task unless you dissect each of the words that the character Krasna has written in his letters. And if you go online, you will read various of essays from people who have taken the task to do that and give you their impression of the film.

From his interests in the banalities of life to the impermanence of images and history.  Needless to say that the film is deep, intelligent and is not meant for a person to sit and watch over one sitting.  Those who have and reviewed the film for a publication were quick to dismiss the film as too self-indulgent and too intelligent, while those who watched it many times, especially when it was released on DVD to pick apart the words that the character Krasna has written in his letters.  There is no denying that Krasna is the voice of Chris Marker, a writer who likes to get into your mind and see things differently.

Personally, I appreciate both films in different types of ways.  ""La Jete"" as an experimental film for its time and ""Sans Soleil"" as a film that is artistic but yet so dense that you need to watch it as many times as possible, but in pieces not entirely.  As mentioned earlier, with each viewing, I'm always discovering something new.

Overall, ""La Jete/Sans Soleil"" is a wonderful release for Chris Marker fans.  There are plenty of supplements and the fact that the video has been restored and contains both English and French versions of the two films is absolutely fantastic.  This title is not exactly the easiest to review but it all comes down to the viewer who wants to be entertained or wants to be intellectually challenged, or a combination of both.  And if you are interested in this release for the latter, then you will find this release from The Criterion Collection to be quite significant and a title that you will find yourself coming back to quite often.  Definitely recommended!",1261008000,,10197,4.839007501442585

Beautiful movie. Everything seems so timeless... you would never pinpoint it to be filmed (using all Man Ray photos) in 1923.

A good thing to say about La Jetee is that it inspired Solyaris (1972).",1250467200,,208,4.594594594594595
1171098,5,837255773X,"Whereas La Jetee depends on the conceit of believing the time travel scenario, and identifying so emotionally with the man that the obvious end seems startling, Sans Soleil ends dependent upon the conceit that so much information about the travels of Krasna has so overwhelmed the viewer, and so lulled him with its rhythmic pacing, that the viewer doubts there can be an end to the film, for Krasna is a character so filled with literal self-conceit it is akin to having an inner seat inside the brain of a man who simply loves the sound of his voice, no matter what nonsense it spews. Thus, when an end does come, it seems abrupt. The interesting thing is that while, stylistically, and innovatively, the later film's ending is far more daring, it simply does not affect the viewer the way the more expected ending of La Jetee does, because there is simply no attempt made to build empathy for Krasna, as there is with the man of the earlier film, nor is there any attempt to make Sans Soleil an emotional work of any kind. From the distancing images of the Icelandic children that open and close the film, to the images from The Zone, this film is detached from reality and emotion. It is also even more explicitly a film about perception, not memory, than La Jetee is.

  The DVD, put out by The Criterion Collection, is one of its best offerings, even if neither film comes with an audio commentary. Both films are shown in 1.66: aspect ratios. The extra features for La Jetee include video interviews with filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin, a bit of an odd duck, whose small filmic rhapsodies on Marker are a bit too much, in the masturbatory sense. Then there is Chris On Chris, a video on Marker by filmmaker Chris Darke. It's more interesting than Gorin's hyperbolic reactions, but then we get some film clips from a filmmaker who idolizes Marker, and it is so inferior to Marker's work that one can only be thankful the guy gets only a minute or two in the sun. Then there are  two excerpts from the French tv series Court-Circuit (Le Magazine). On is a take on David Bowie's music video Jump They Say, reputedly inspired by La Jet&eacute;e; and the other a delightfully silly homage to Marker's influence by Hitchcock's Vertigo, because it posits that Marker's La Jetee is really about the man traveling in to Vertigo. Naturally, there is not a whit of logic nor proof behind the claim. The extra for Sans Soleil is a seventeen minute interview with Gorin, again. In this extended segment he comes off a bit more knowledgeable than in the deliberately coy smaller excerpts for La Jetee. The musical scoring for both films is very good, with wistful music often acting as the mortar between images in La Jetee, when the images are static and sans narration. All the visuals and editing were done by Marker, and he proves masterful at both.

  As these two films are Marker's best known works, and considered his best, one wonders if this is a critical misinterpretation, or apt. Naturally, I'll decide when I see other films of his. That stated, it bears repeating that these films, despite many claims by critics notorious for the tack of critical cribbing, are definitely not about memory. They will use some mnemonic devices, but they are about perception; and there is a difference. Perception is memory in the moment, in the now, whereas memory is perception of the now's shadow, the moment's shadow. Therefore they scan two different beats. One is the thing as it is, and the other a recreation of what seems to be the thing as it was. Memory is always an act of creation, or re-creation, which takes talent and skill to effectively convey. Perception just takes good senses. Perception requires attention. Memory does not. It requires concentration. And, as great as the purely cinematic elements are, as I've shown, both La Jetee and Sans Soleil would be vastly different and inferior films without the narration that sutures word to image, and both to a whole. These films are essential works of art from the 20th Century, and will likely have impacts that reach far into the future, long after much more celebrated works and artists have been forgotten.

1171099,5,837255773X,"I wish I could review these separately, but whatever.  I guess it's a really good thing that I love both of them and would give both of them A's anyways.  I do not love them equally, so I'll start with the one I prefer.

La Jetee.

I will say this first; I am not really one who is overly excited about science fiction films.  I mean, yeah, I like them enough, but for the most part I find them uninspired and kind of forgettable.  There are a few exceptions (`Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' effortlessly meshes so many genres together in a unique and very rewarding way) but for the most part science fiction is often reserved for the summer Hollywood blockbusters that make a lot of money, fill a lot of seats, but rely so heavily on special effects that the storylines and plot points are disregarded altogether.

They are mindless.

What makes `La Jetee' so special is that it ditches the special effects for a rich story and unique vision.  Chris Marker (who made his name in documentaries, which says a lot for the direction this film takes) uses still images (yes, this is NOT a live action film) to tell the story of Parisian survivors of a disaster that forced them underground.  When they begin to tamper with time travel they uncover a story of one man's life that is intriguing and astonishing to behold.

I can't say more than that for fear I'll ruin the whole thing.

The film is short yet it packs a nice punch, and the still imagery says more than any live action could.  It carries an air of coldness to it, but that helps with the films lingering aftereffects.  It may not sound off the bat to be something you'd readily find entertaining, but I urge you to give it a try.

And that brings us to the second film provided on this DVD.

Sans Soleil.

Now, I prefer `La Jetee' mainly because it is so unique in its approach, but if I'm completely honest with myself `Sans Soleil' is probably the better film, for it has a lot to say and it says it in such a thought provoking manner.  Told much like a documentary would be told, a man's collection of vacation videos are narrated by a female friend whom he has written to and confided in.  As he travels the globe she recounts his experiences and his intimate thoughts on life, humanity, time, memory and much more.  So, like `La Jetee', this is not your typical film.  It is told in random film clips, but it is ravishing in its intellectual look at human understanding.

Again, to say more would be a crime against the next viewer.

So, neither of these films may be pictures you would have sought out on your own, but hopefully this review will inspire you to try something new.  Even if you are not as enthusiastic about these films as I am, you can at least say that you expanded your horizons with something unique and undeniably special.",1245196800,2,2817,4.4147286821705425

The basic story is not entirely new to SF-readers: in a post atomic-war future some government (they speak german) make experiments in time travel. The protagonist manages to slip in and out of the past, before the war. It's better to see it than read the story - the strength of La Jetee is the imagery (still pictures) and the poetic feeling. Either you like it or you don't. This Criterion edition also includes Sans Soleil, a sort of travel film for the most part taking place in Japan. It's very unique, like a flow of images and narration that is almost hypnotizing.

1171102,5,837255773X,"'Sans soleil' is a wonderful film that defies classification (beyond that of 'cult'). If you know anything about this quasi-documentary and the accompanying short, La jetee, (the two bookmark the beginning and the latter stages of a long career), then this review won't tell you anything new, but if you're half-interested/undecided, it might help. 'Sans soleil' takes the form of a letter presented in voice-over narration fashion, describing life in Tokyo, circa early 1980s. Tokyo is presented almost as an alien city, yet the viewer begins to be as fascinated with it as is the narrator. It's no exaggeration to say it's a kind of kaleidoscope or phatasmagoria of images and signs. Occasionally, there are flashes of life in Guinea-Bissau, to which Marker and the letter-reader cross-cut, though the point of which still somewhat escapes me. Tokyo, with its various media images from manga and horror films, seems to stand in for Japan as a whole, though the narrator does go on the odd excursion, for example to Hokkaido, and to a museum dedicated to male fertilty. There are some occasional scenes of extreme violence or just plainly disturbing images (even almost-subliminal out-takes from other films) taken from other media, but the whole is knitted together into an unlikely but rewarding patchwork. You couldn't get this much quality exposure to things Japanese if you watched Japanese TV or stood browsing in a Tokyo bookshop for two weeks non-stop, that's how rich it is. My favourite sequence deals with commuters going through Tokyo Station, ascending and descending stairs and, most especially, dozing off on an overground train. The film may have been shot in the eighties, but you could (if permitted) film identical scenes today). How Marker managed to film this and get permission I will never know (maybe he never did), because he superimposes very telling and sometimes horrifying and yet somehow everyday images onto these poor commuters in a way I find quite mesmerising. The sequence seems to visit and rummage around in the very pysche of what it's like to live, work, and travel in this incredibly busy city. The soundtrack is brilliantly spooky and and an essential part of the experience. 'La jetee' is an amazing science fiction film, though almost completely made up of still images, aside from one short sequence, that tells the story of a love affair that takes place at a time of Armageddon and dizzyingly backtracks to the events that led up to  one event. It was the inspiration for Terry Gilliam's 'Twelve Monkeys'. Both films are beautifully narrated in French, but there is an optional English narration if you want to really concentrate on the ravishing images. There are some excellent extras, too, including experimental film-maker Gorin talking about Marker.",1199145600,4,2801,5.10239651416122

I do not speak French, and I can't imagine trying to follow anything as dense and philosophical as Sans Soleil via subtitles. The consensus among folks I've talked to who know both languages is that the performance of the English narration is very good. On the other hand, I first saw La Jettee in French with subtitles, and it was easy enough to follow. Hearing the film with English narration, I was greatly diasappointed, as the English narrator sounds bland and too casual for the story. Again, my multilingual acquaintances concur. So, for the best user experience IMHO, watch La Jettee with the French audio and subtitles, so you get the sense of texture from the French voice.

1171105,5,837255773X,"La Jetee (Chris Marker, 1962)

I'm not terribly sure what I can say about Chris Marker's La Jetee that hasn't been said by just about everyone else, so I'll keep this short. You probably already know this, but if you don't, it was the inspiration for David and Janet Peoples' screenplay for the Terry Gilliam film 12 Monkeys, rightly considered by the various-and-sundry on the IMDB message boards to be one of the top 250 movies of all time. (Interestingly, La Jetee has a slightly higher numerical rating; it lacks enough votes to secure a top-250 placing.) But where Gilliam molded the storyline into his most accessible (and commercially successful) film, Marker seemed to have no interest at all in making something accessible, or even likable; it's hard, in fact, to even call La Jetee a film, in the sense we know the word. That, of course, makes it all the more enchanting.

The story (if you haven't seen 12 Monkeys, a quick synopsis: a guy is sent through time in order to try and prevent the war that effectively ended civilization on Earth) is told, with one stunning exception, in a series of still images, over which there is narration. A story is being told, with accompanying pictures. The film, which clocks in at only twenty-eight minutes, barely draws the outline of this story, leaving the viewer to fill in as many of the blanks as he or she wishes. It's a bold move, and when it doesn't work, it's awful. Here, it works on every level it can.

If it were just that, it would be a good movie. Interesting. A nice idea with a cool experimental sheen to it. But Marker turns the whole structure on its head halfway through the movie with a scene that defines ""minimalism,"" but within the context of what we've seen up to this point in the movie, it comes as a shock, an amazing revelation. I won't tell you what happens (other than to say it's a technical thing, not a plot point), because you should feel that shock for yourself the first time you see this movie. But what makes it great it's that it's not just an experimental quirk for the sake of being an experimental quirk. It takes all the notions you have conceived, consciously or not, about these two societies Marker has given us, and twists them around. I can't say any more about it without distorting the perceptions Marker goes to such pains to create; you just have to see it for yourself. And you should, because this is, quite simply, an amazing piece of work. And, really, if you can spare an hour and a half to watch the latest Adam Sandler vehicle, you can carve out half an hour to watch this, no? **** ",1189987200,11,2594,4.512765957446809
1171106,5,837255773X,"La Jetee (1962) is one of the seminal works of the French New Wave as well as one of the all-time great science fiction films. It deserves all the respect it receives but what is really so amazing is how much is achieved with so little. Made entirely of still black and white images--of WWII cities in ruin, of an airport observation deck in the fifties, of generic shots of a woman one could find in any magazine, of a group of men in one of the many tunnels beneath Paris--and a mundane but strangely compelling voice-over, Le Jetee is not so much a film as a series of random images linked only by the narrative spell of a single voice.

We view only one still photo at a time and we assign meaning only because the narrator tells us the significance of each. It doesn't sound like much to describe it so and yet because the technology is so primtive we are somehow less distracted than we would be were this a full-fledged cinematic production with action sequences and a pulsing soundtrack. This is basically a slide-show and that is the key to this films appeal. This film essay works because it asks for a different kind of attention than we are used to giving films. La Jetee asks for a much more personal kind of attention, the kind of attention we give to our own photo albums, slide shows and dreams. But, also, since many of the images look like they could have come from LIFE or National Geographic there is also a kind of generic quality to the slide show and we are lulled into a kind of attentive trance as we get the feeling that Marker is making a connection between our own personal memories/dreams/markers and the generic memories/dreams/markers of the culture at large. Watching this film is like looking at a pile of old magazines and contemplating our own deepest dreams/desires at the same time--perhaps viewing both as vehicles leading to the same place.

The presumption that there is a link between the personal and the universal is not a new idea, it is a presumption that various artists and essayists (Montaigne is the most obvious example) have held throughout history. The idea has developed in two ways. Some (Noam Chomsky is the most famous in our day) argue that the deep structures of the mind are the same in all men regardless of cultural/racial/gender differences. Others argue that man is no particular way but that he is shaped by the culture in which he lives. The former group celebrate universalism (or globalism, a word which began to be used after WWII) and the fact that we are all generic creatures capable of understanding each other. The latter group (and many science fiction writers fall into this group) fear that the more homogenous and pervasive the mass/universal/global culture becomes, the more homogenous man/existence becomes. Marker is in the latter group, so it is no surprise that he has a strange love/hate relationship with technology--for technology is seen to be the thing that facilitates the spreading of sameness as well as the thing that allows us to meditate upon it. In his films there are no special effects nor any of the usual visual or audio markers that we usually equate with science fiction, and the matter-of-fact monotone of the voiceover gives his films the feel of a documentary but a documentary that we somehow feel compelled to watch because as the speaker drones on we are reminded of our own archive of memories and our own personal views on the matters raised. La Jetee alerts us to the importance we place on memory and the recall process in establishing and maintaining an identity in an image saturated world but it also asks us to question the reliability and authenticity of memory and to what extent personal memory has been invaded/colonized by collective memory. In the later Sans Soleil (which makes use of moving images and color and in many ways resembles a contemporary travelogue or catalogue of all the various cultures that co-exist today), Marker alerts us to how conditioned our responses have become. Even in the presence of one exotic culture after another all the narrator can muster is a kind of bored resignation that there is no escape (except perhaps in death, a device/conceit that Godard also makes use of as early as Pierrot le Fou and as recently as Notre Musique) from the universalizing cultural processing machine that we have each internalized and that reduces all to a monotonous sameness.

That said, the films are at once both generic and intensely personal. The latter film is perhaps the more intimate as it is delivered as a personal letter. What is personal about existence and what merely generic is the question that informs every still and every moving image in a Marker film. This strangely unsolvable riddle is what gives the films their timeless power.

This is film essay/art of the highest order.",1186790400,58,4833,4.75

How to explain Chris Marker? How to explain these works? Gorin said something true about La Jete when he pointed out that the one moment of motion in this film is ""the birth of cinema"". It's lodged in the midst of 28 minutes of what I'll call still life montage. He called it a miracle moment and it is. To have this dead woman, alive in a past he's returned to, re-animated at that moment with the birds singing as if it were the first Spring on earth is breathtaking.

Sans Soleil is about memory and sight and sound and cinema and the whole world within and without. Grandiose, ridiculous language comes too easily while trying to describe this man's vision.

Superlatives barely begin to scratch the surface, but it is surreal, haunting, poignant, ethereal and unlike any other 'documentary' you have seen or are ever likely too.  The film is ultimately about the heartbreaking beauty of the time and place in which we (do or do not) exist.  Featuring Marker's central preoccupations of time, space and memory, Sans Soleil needs to be seen to be believed.",1180051200,24,450,4.894736842105263
1171122,5,837255773X,"I am very happy that Chris Marker's La Jette (and Sans Soleil) are on DVD.  La Jetee is a wonderful, incredibly haunting film.  It can easily be classified as one of the greatest science fiction films ever made in my opinion.  It only runs 28 minutes, and is composed of nothing but still images and narration (except for one shot), yet the universe is contained within it.  It's that rare cerebral science fiction that hardly gets made these days, along the lines of 2001, Blade Runner, and Solaris (Tarkovsky's version).  It was the inspiration for Twelve Monkeys, and while Monkeys is a great film in itself, La Jetee is much more haunting and moving.  It's wonderful to be able to see La Jetee in a proper transfer.",1178841600,58,719,4.622047244094488

La Jetee is often called a ""science fiction"" film while Sans Soleil is labeled as a ""documentary"", however both films defy these simple descriptions.  While very different in form, both La Jetee and Sans Soleil will challenge your ideas of memory and time and spacial relationships.  These films are absolutely critical viewing for discerning film fans.  Kudos to Criterion for finally bringing these films to the U.S.  I only wish that other films such as ""La Mystere Koumiko"" by Marker will follow.",1178582400,16,582,5.020833333333333

1171125,5,837255773X,"I only want to cover  La Jete  here which sounds like being more of

a fictional work than the  Sans Soleil . It is of course dated by the

missile crisis in Cuba and the assassination of John Fitzgerald

Kennedy, pending at the time of the film but widely in the air of this

phase of the Cold War when some powerful military personnel were

forgetting they were the personnel of the people and only thought they

were the personnel of their own adventures. Here we are in the

aftermath of the third world war, nuclear by definition. Paris is

bombed down into a pile of radioactive rubbles. Among the survivors two

clans : the victors, which is natural since they seize all power over

the others, and the prisoners who are the other ones who do not want to

fight for a piece of the power cake. Then Chris Marker crisscrosses many

borrowed elements. One from the concentration camps implies the

prisoners can be freely used as guinea pigs for experiments. This is

bleak and gross but absolutely realistic : anyone in these conditions

who would be told he can help the survivors to survive would do it.

Then the Time Traveler is introduced in the picture, not with a machine

but with an IV-injection. Just like Wells does, they try to go to the

past and then to the future. This rewriting is interesting because in

the past the time traveler discovers what it used to be, but is no

longer. This trip is thus completely fake since what he calls real cats

and real birds are nothing but mental images of vanished beings. His

love affair for a woman there is even worse since he can only love

someone who is dead and for whom he is nothing but a ghost. Then the

shorter section of time traveling to the future is completely opposed

to what H.G. Wells imagined : he meets with a more advanced society

that can travel in time too and these can even grant him his last

desire before he is put to death by his detainers in this

post-apocalyptic present. So he ends in the past, in Orly, on the day

when he saw a man dying as we have seen in the opening sequence,

running towards the woman he has learned to love, and dying just before

he can reach her, unplugged by the victors in his post-apocalyptic

present. But this last scene is the first scene of the film, the

recollection of the character witnessing the death of an unknown man in

exactly the same place and same circumstances. Was he predestined to

see his own death when a child and then live this death later on,

apparently on his own will, though not knowing he was enacting a

recollection ? There is a further possible discourse about this short

film. The form of the film itself leads to it. It is a comic strip

built with a succession of commented stills. It is the belief that man

has extra-sensorial capabilities that he does not exploit. A man dreams

of the past and of the future but neglects these dreams, even if they

are nightmares. He is haunted at times with some dreams, structures,

situations, etc. And yet this man will neglect them and will not be

able to decipher the message they may contain. Here Chris Marker

deciphers the message of a child's fugacious vision seeing a man dying

on a pier in Orly Airport. If the end is true, if it was his own death,

then the whole film is true, which we will doubt very much. Or the

whole film is nothing but the mental construction of the child's mind

that identifies with the dying man there in front of him, revealing his

morbid neurosis. And then the destruction of the world, the time

traveling episodes and his final death which means his refusal to be

saved in the future world, to get an outlet in some distant future time

reveals the morbid and death-inflicting neurosis that verges onto some

kind of killing psychosis. That's a hard way to commit the total crime

of destroying the whole world and then to commit one's own suicide,

just to clean up one's mind of these thanatic desires and suicidal

projects. This film was produced by a normal mind distracted from

reality and deranged by the reality of the Cold Watr in 1962-63 to the

point of destroying the world, killing himself fictionally and even

sending himself into a childish present that has already seen his own

death, hence in which he is nothing but a living dead. It is this

gordian knot that makes the film a masterpiece. The Cold War made us

all living dead people and we did live like that, always afraid of the

red button.

The story concerns about an astronaut who travels back through time to realize an affair - very brief, indeed - with a woman he once glimpsed  But the entire film except a brief shot, is narrated with the support of photographs and isolated shots. As a matter of fact it became a substantial reference to Terry Gilliam in his memorable ""Twelve monkeys""

I've purchased a VHS and DVD print that offered transfers so dark and poorly resolved that the spectator had to settle for my narration of it.  Please, I won't accept another bad transfer.

Fortunately, I've seen La Jetee on a sharp, brightly-lit 16mm print (in fact, I own a copy--it's the projector that I don't trust).  Putting aside such pragmatic concerns, I can think of no film that ""cuts"" deeper than this 28-minute masterpiece.  It not only touches a nerve: it all but severs it, hurting more with each birthday, each passing day, each remaining moment.  Its closest analog in literature is Ambrose Bierce's short story, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" or Keats' ""Ode on a Grecian Ode.""

If you don't ""like"" the film or understand it, perhaps it's just as well.  It can be a heavy cross to bear, even though we, along with our predecessors and successors, will have to shoulder it.  The film illuminates life's course, offering the viewer a penetrating and indelible view of its tragic outcome.  But it doesn't offer any consolation.  It can only be hoped that the viewer will have time to make his or her own leap of faith. (For me, the inescapable paradox is alleviated by reading how others have struggled with it--the works of Kierkegaard and Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" chief among the texts that offer guidance.)",1441497600,,1522,4.7272727272727275

It accomplishes in a few short minutes what many films find it difficult to achieve in hours.  But I'm not here to talk about La Jetee.  Sans Soleil is the crown jewel of this collection.

Sans Soleil is like no other film.  It is a documentary.  It is a poem.  It is a meditation on memory, culture, history, time, life, death, and the universe.  To say that Chris Marker was ahead of his time would be an understatement.  Chris Marker was ahead of our time.  Sans Soleil offers a glimpse of what film, as a medium, can achieve when it is released from the shackles of conventions and expectations.

It is rare to find two of the best films ever made on one disc like this.  From a pure value standpoint, one gets the most bang for one's buck from this set than any other Criterion Collection release.  These are films that more people need to see.
