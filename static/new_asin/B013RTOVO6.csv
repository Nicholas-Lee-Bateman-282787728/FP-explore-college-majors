7370994,5,B013RTOVO6,"As film archivist for the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum I have seen these comedies many times.  But now it is like putting your glasses on and seeing the fine details for the first time.  One wonders why it has taken so long for these films to look this good.

Blu-ray disc 1
HIS NEW JOB (you can now read the lettering on the door) shows a vast improvement over the previous, soft, Image DVD.  The level of sharp detail is like traveling back in time to see this when it was new.

A NIGHT OUT does lose it's blue and orange tints which I do prefer, but most of the image is so much sharper that I will give that up.  There are still some sequences that lack detail & look muddy, the surviving Nitrate prints are apparently missing these scenes and the dupe safety negative had to be used.  This is better that having the scenes lost.  One wonders why Chaplin himself didn't request a 1st generation print for himself when he made these.

IN THE PARK loses it's yellow tint from the previous DVD and the image looks about the same, even though it was re-scanned in High Definition in 2014.  Don't get me wrong, the original DVD transfer on this title was very sharp, the best in the set.  So I am not saying this new presentation is inferior to the others in this set, just that it is not a big improvement over the old DVD like the others are.  It is just as good as the others here.

A JITNEY ELOPEMENT is one of my favorites as it shows the windmills in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park when they were functioning to pump the water through the park. The improvements in the new HD transfer are not apparent until the balcony scene at 2:30 in, the vines growing on the trellis are much more defined on the Blu-ray. After that, almost every scene shows marked improvement in crispness.  The old volume 1 DVD transfer had very good contrast & gray tones and little room is left for improvement, but there is an improvement. If you look at the dining room scene, over Edna's left shoulder there can be seen an outdoor fence, on the new Blu-ray this is clearly seen but on the old DVD the darkness tends to crush the image of the fence a little.
The improvements in the Blu-ray becomes even more noticeable in the second half park sequence.  The old DVD is soft here while the Blu-ray looks nicely in focus.
The film speed has been changed, I couldn't keep the discs in sync.  This new Blu-ray runs the film faster than the old DVD.  Comparing the two, I prefer this faster film film presentation.
Yes the windmills are still in Golden Gate Park today, restored but no longer usefully functional.

THE TRAMP is quite impressive at 1080p.  From the first time you see Charlie walking down Niles Canyon Road you could count the leaves on the trees if you wanted to.  Every blade of grass is seen in sharp detail.  While the old Volume 2 DVD had very good contrast and gray tones, the focus was a bit soft.  You could tell that the trees had leaves and there was grass, but you couldn't see every leaf and blade.  The improvement in sharpness is quite incredible.  Since the contrast and gray tones were excellent in the old DVD there was little room for improvement, they are also excellent here. There is still a little Nitrate flicker in the contrast, smoothing out this flicker would have been nice.
 At the 18 minute mark the old DVD starts tinting the picture with Blue or Orange, this new Blu-ray keeps the film in monotone gray.  I'm not sure why the old DVD started tinting the film half way through, keeping the film in monotone seems more pleasant.  The old DVD's Blue tints for the exterior scenes make it feel like the action is taking place at night.  The monotone Blu-ray keeps all of the action to the daytime.  At 23:20 the DVDs tints disappear.

BY THE SEA - The old DVD tends to crush the blacks in a few scenes, dark jackets have more details on the new Blu-ray.  However at other times there is little difference between the two releases.  The contrast is improved on the Blu-ray, the old DVD has some shots with less gray-tones.

HIS REGENERATION is more of a G.M. Anderson melodrama with Chaplin supplying the comedy relief.  The original DVD featured color tints and had a title card stating ""Essanay Photoplay HIS REGENERATION Presenting G.M. ANDERSON Slightly Assisted By Charles Chaplin"" which sounds original.  The B&W Blu-ray has re-worded this title card to simply ""HIS REGENERATION. Featuring Charles Chaplin. Essanay-Chaplin Brand"". Since Chaplin only appears in the first 6 minutes, the DVD title card seems to be the correct wording.
The sharpness of details has been greatly improved with the Blu-ray.  The whites do seem to be crushed, this is improved on the old DVD by the color tinting.  However the old DVD crushes the blacks severely and the black details are crisp on the Blu-ray. The improvement of the Blu-ray is most noticeable 7 minutes in whet G.M. Anderson enters the dark room, there is so much new detail to be seen in the Blu-ray!
I notice quite a bit of compression artifacting on the old DVD that is only film grain on the Blu-ray.

WORK again loses the color tints of the original DVD but gains sharpness & details.  In some ways the tints were unimaginative, using green for both indoor shots and outside street scenes.

Unlike the Mutual Blu-ray restorations, we know what the original Essanay titles looked like and they are presented here as originally seen.  The restoration credits now appear before the film title cards, so you will feel like you are seeing them as first.

The music is much more pleasant and IN SYNC with the action.

So if you are having any doubts about upgrading your old DVDs, put those doubts away and BUY THIS. You will not be disappointed.",1449100800,11,5723,4.515533980582524
7370995,5,B013RTOVO6,"This is another gem from the folks at Flicker Alley who  in connection with Blackhawk Films and the French company Lobster Films  have already released the Keystone Collection and the Mutual Collection of Chaplins early short films. This set was timed perfectly for the 100th anniversary of the 15 films. Honestly, this is the first time I have seen MOST of these and all have been restored so they look great. (Yes, some things cant be corrected, but these are in the minority). The scores are played by various types of accompaniment from solo piano to small orchestra.

There are a bunch of bonuses too! Essanay apparently re-edited one of the films without Chaplins permission and this is included as a bonus and two others are re-edited to conform as best they can be to Chaplins intentions.

The 28 page booklet (also part of Flicker Alley releases) has an extensive essay by Chaplin specialist.

The package includes both one Bluray (with all the contents) and two DVDs so that EVERYONE can see these now and those who have not gone Bluray yet can watch now and upgrade later.

Im just an average movie fan who loves old movies  and I don't hold myself out as an expert. Ill recommend that you also read the review posted by fellow Amazon reviewer Chip Kaufman for more details about the films. I think fans of film preservation owe a great debt of gratitude to Jeff Massino, head of Flicker Alley, for making sure the quality of their releases is the best we can hope for. I watch a lot of earlier FA releases and I cant wait to see whats coming for 2016.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7370996,5,B013RTOVO6,"For the most part, the picture quality is stunning, though the source material itself varies during the run of each short - some of the sources are lighter or have less contrast than the others. However, the overall gray scale is gorgeous and the detail is superb. Keep in mind that these are 100 year old films; they're scratched and are missing frames here and there. Still, I've never seen these films look this good. I remember seeing high-contrast fuzzy prints of these when I was a kid; I never thought I'd see prints like these.

And let's not forget - these are very funny films. I was laughing out loud many times just watching the first two films.

Well worth every penny.....",1448323200,3,686,4.569105691056911
7370997,5,B013RTOVO6,"The restoration of these films is marvelous.

Even in previous restorations some of these movies were virtually unwatachable.  Worse still, some earlier music scores were dreadful: in David Shepards earlier version, Chaplins CARMEN burlesque was a film I had to watch silently because the music was SO atrocious that I was starting to throw things at my movie screen.  And although almost (almost) all the music was excellent in the recent Flicker Alley release of Chaplins MUTUAL films, most of the soundtracks went way, way, way, WAY out of sync as the movies went alonggetting more and more early to the action, more and more early and early and earlier and earlier to the action, until the sound was WAY ahead of the picture which destroyed the fun of the restorations.  (The Rink, and especially Easy Street were happy exceptions to this problem.)

No such problems here.

These movies LOOK fantasticIve never seen better representations of the Essanay films.

And the SOUND is great.

The music for these movies is some of the most endearing, up-beat, era-fitting, wonderfully melodic and properly rhythmic music ever to delight the human ear.

The soundtracks do often feel as if they were, wellcompiledrather than composed directly for each specific scene of a specific movie; and its mostly put together rather sloppily: that is to say, sometimes the performers seem insistent upon finishing a piece they are playing, regardless of whether or not the scene has ended (or has already ended many seconds ago).  But because of the type of music they are playing, and that it always seems to match the rhythms or at least the spirit of the scenes we are watching, this doesnt really matter.

The music flows along jauntily while Chaplins visual business bubbles along briskly.  Its a beautiful fit.

The sound is either in sync with the picture, or it's such generic (but appropriate) music that it doesn't matter if the synchronization is a little rubbery at times!  (For instance, Robert Israel's music seems taken from a previous release, and not much was done to change it to fit the new restorations.  So, music for one scene doesn't end when another scene with a different mood begins, and there are a lot of musical highlights obviously meant for a specific action in the movie, but they come too early or too late.  Still, the music is so generally appropriate that for once I can't really complain.  Although I suppose the question I SHOULD ask is... why are the audio and image NOT in perfect sync?  I mean, it isn't difficult to make it so.  But... what the hell...)

The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra via Rodney Sauer, and all of Robert Israels music is absolutely beautiful and completely winning.  Sometimes I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep watching a movie Ive seen many times, but the music was such a delight that I couldn't stop watching.  I turned on the first movie, planning only to watch that one, and then practically watched the entire first DVD in one sitting, largely because I was enjoying the music so much.

And this particular set of musical scores REALLY helps make these movies watchable.  The previous set of Essanays seemed a little tiring, even boring, but the combination of Chaplins visual comedy and this brilliant sparkling music makes every film in this release compelling and continuously engaging.

But as good as Mont Alto and Israel are, and they are superb, if you really want to see and hear how a real soundtrack to a silent comedy movie should work, watch A NIGHT AT THE SHOW.

Now THIS is how to write music for a comedy!

WOW!

Timothy Brock is brilliant.  This film with his music is my ideal fit of score-to-film (comedy).  AND HIS MUSIC IS ALL IN PERFECT SYNCHRONIZATION WITH THE ACTION!

Thank you David Shepard, thank you Flicker Alley, thank you Lobster people, and thank all of you excellent composers.  FINALLY we have a set of restored movies that were not released unfinished, but were taken ALL THE WAY THROUGH the process INCLUDING the final synch-up (well, almost).

Excellent, superb, and BRAVO!

Yes, as Ollie says to Stannie:  NOW were GETTING somewhere!

And to slightly distort the famous words of Oliver Twist  Please sir[s and madams] I want some more

(Now if we could just get Timothy Brock to compose a totally in-sync musical score for THE LOST WORLD, instead of  cough, choke I cant even say it)",1448236800,3,4389,4.790945406125166
7370998,5,B013RTOVO6,"Released just in time to commemorate their 100th anniversary, this new Flicker Alley Blu-Ray/DVD set of Chaplin's ESSANAY COMEDIES will be the last word on the subject (that is until the next upgrade in video technology comes along). The visual quality of these two reel comedies is hard to believe for anyone who remembers seeing them in previous incarnations (I first encountered them in well worn 8mm copies shown at a Shakey's Pizza Parlor back in the 1960s) including the 1999 Image Entertainment DVD releases although those were the best available at the time. Once again the driving force behind this set, as was the case with the Flicker Alley KEYSTONE & MUTUAL sets is David Shepard of Film Preservation Associates and Blackhawk Films (who were responsible for the 8mm prints I saw all those years ago). As is documented in the booklet that accompanies these discs, it has taken a dozen years, and the combined efforts of Blackhawk, Lobster Films, and Cineteca Bologna to reassemble these pre-feature Chaplin shorts from various prints as no single Chaplin Essanay negative still exists. The combining of several prints to make one looks better than ever thanks to digital restoration technology which allows for a uniform look. In other words, they have never looked this good.

The photographic detail revealed from HIS NEW JOB through POLICE makes these films look close to what they must have 100 years ago. The interiors may look cheap and two dimensional (which they were) but not the cinematography. Chaplin even utilizes a moving camera on a couple of occasions which was virtually unheard of in a silent comedy. Of the 12 two reelers and 3 one reelers that Chaplin made for Essanay I have always loved THE TRAMP for its sentimentality and A NIGHT IN THE SHOW for preserving Chaplin's English Music Hall background. The BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is another favorite and is doubly hilarious if you have seen the Cecil B. DeMille original. My one minor complaint is that I wish they had used the tinted print of BURLESQUE that was used on the old Image CARMEN DVD (which is no longer available). The musical contributions by Robert Israel, Timothy Brock, and Rodney Sauer & the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra add immensely to the enjoyment of these ""works in progress"". The ESSANAYS combine the crude kinetic energy of the KEYSTONES with the polished artistry of the MUTUALS making them an ideal place to start for those who want to study Chaplin. They may be 100 years old but they still have much to offer.",1447459200,12,2521,4.876456876456876

8728615,4,B013RTOVO6,"I just purchased Chaplin's Essanay Comedies.  I have been a silent film fan all my life and appreciate the talent and style that went in to the productions. Charlie Chaplin is one of the greatest comedians ever to appear on film.  I have collected his works in various formats over the years, from Super 8mm to VHS, Laser, DVD and now Blu-Ray.  Flicker Alley should be commended for restoring these classic gems, but here is why I can not give this release 5 stars.

First, if I wanted to purchase this collection on DVD, I would have looked for the DVD release.  Why must we get DVDs also when we wanted the Blu-Ray version?  Flicker Alley could have saved us money if they didn't include the DVDs, in their own separate case.  I total waste for someone who is only going to watch the Blu-Ray version.

Second, concerning the restorations.  They have elected to replace all of the title cards and give you a black screen with more modern, white  lettering?  While the font is readable it does not match the fonts or title cards used in the original prints.  Any silent purist would notice this right away.  While this may seem unimportant to some, it may bother those who have been silent film fans for a number of years.

Other than the two complaints, this will probably be the best you will see these films.  I just wish they would have restored and recreated the title cards.",1463011200,8,1380,4.508064516129032
8728616,5,B013RTOVO6,"I am amazed at how well Chaplin's Essanay shorts from 1915 are preserved on this Blu-ray DVD.  I think we are starting to get close to seeing these shorts as audiences saw them in theaters more than 100 years age.  These shorts are very dated and the story lines are highly repetitive, but anyone who is looking to purchase Chaplin's Essanay films is already a very intense fan and understands the nature of the content on these discs.",1461196800,4,435,4.564102564102564

8728619,5,B013RTOVO6,"To all Chaplin lovers,
There's nothing worse than letting a unique opportunity pass you by. These Essanay comedies are the proof of Chaplin's Little Tramp character's genius and humanity. This Little Tramp had a temper. And he wasn't afraid to Strike-Back if the situation called for it. Look for a scrappy Little Tramp in these comedies. Chaplin hit his stride right here. The Keystone comedies are also no less than wonderful, but Chaplin's years at Keystone were developmental ones. Once he went to Essanay he had The Little Tramp firmly in mind and body. Things matured when he went to Mutual and First National. But these Essanay's are the raw, naked testament to Chaplin's Little Tramp's character and temperament. It would be a shame to let this set pass you by. Eventually, it will fall out of print as all releases eventually do. I wouldn't let that happen before you've had your chance to own it and watch it over and over to experience the true nature of Charlie Chaplin's The Little Tramp character.",1452297600,5,1011,4.816091954022989
8728620,5,B013RTOVO6,"Flicker Alley completes its trilogy of Charlie Chaplin's early film work with this exceptional Blu-ray/DVD combo edition of the comic genius' output for the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company. As was the case with the Keystone and Mutual restorations, this latest home video release is outstanding with all fourteen titles looking as good as they possibly can since their original release one hundred years ago.

After his acclaimed apprenticeship at Keystone, Chaplin signed with Essanay where he was able to eschew his films with more fully realized plots and characters, as well as the additional element of pathos. The less hectic production schedule also allowed Chaplin to take his time in building gag situations to their full potential. Indeed, THE CHAMPION, THE TRAMP, WORK, THE BANK, and POLICE are all marvelously crafted comedies that I would rank among Chaplin's finest films. They already contain all the ingredients that surface in his Mutual two reelers, the First Nationals, and the famous feature length comedies.

The restorations, again supervised by David Shepard, have been compiled from various sources - mostly nitrate - including Blackhawk Films, Lobster Films, The Library of Congress and The Museum of Modern Art, among others. The results far surpass prior editions of the Essanays, including the ones from Image Entertainment. That said, there are still some unavoidable reservations, which is understandable given the age of the source material. For example, there are noticeable shifts in quality when different prints were combined, such as in A NIGHT OUT, where the denser nitrate stock clearly registers better than the grayer footage obtained from acetate and duped material. However, this is a relatively minor quibble, and anyone who is familiar with these films will heartily agree that they have never looked this sharp and clear since they were first shown in theaters.

New music scores accompany all the films, having been provided by Robert Israel, Timothy Brock, and The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.

Extra features include TRIPLE TROUBLE, a film that Essanay assembled together after Chaplin left the studio, and CHARLIE BUTTS IN, which is a shortened version of A NIGHT OUT and plays out as a different film. Also included is a 28-page illustrated booklet with liner notes by Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance.

It is a testament to the timeless talents of the premiere screen clown that these comic gems from so long ago can still make us laugh out loud.

My highest recommendation.",1449619200,6,2535,5.262376237623762
