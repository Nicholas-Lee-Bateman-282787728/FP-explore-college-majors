987515,1,6305196311,"This story is plagued by many shortcomings.  The casting is all wrong.  The military characters have personality traits more like ballet dancers, such as panicking at small dangers.  They are frequently insubordinate and trigger-happy.  Scientific types are more like night club employees. The dialog is all wrong.  The middle class characters frequently have confrontative and other types of lower class behavior and make trivial tripe and irrelevant statements.  The plot is full of easily avoidable logical flaws.  After direction finding a radio transmission accurately enough to identify the emitter, the officer of the watch tells the radio operator to tune the signal in.  A free lance, economically disadvantaged space signal researcher has the equipment which enables him to analyze the radio transmissions from an airplane well over the horizon and determine that the main beam of its antenna pattern is away from the earth while misidentifying the altitude as that of a space satellite.",1027209600,4,997,5.428571428571429
987516,5,6305196311,"Invasion Earth is an excellent example of British sci-fi at its best, following in the tradition of Quatermass rather than Dr Who. Some of the acting is rather stereotyped and the dialogue at times is like wading through thick mud but the originality of the concept and the intelligent tackling of complex ideas eclipses the shortcomings of this movie. The exploration of an alien species (NDs) that is just that, alien, is rarely done in science fiction. The Aliens in Star trek or Babylon 5 are usually a human with bumpy foreheads but here they are very alien with a totally non-human psychology. It is this alien ness that gives the movie its suspense and drama. It is interesting to see North American viewers commenting on the unusual end. The British, unlike the North Americans, often like their drama to have realistic themes and if necessary messy endings; just like real life. Look at our Soaps if you want other examples. This movie is no different; an alien invasion or take over would be far more likely to be successful or hugely destructive than to finish with an independence day ending, also as in real life there would be a lot of loose endings. It is refreshing to see a science fiction movie ending with the death of a key character, a lot of unanswered questions and with no guarantee of the survival of the human species.",985305600,10,1344,4.675105485232067
987517,3,6305196311,"The Brits have done it again, creating a gripping SciFi drama that is not only engaging but innovative as well.  Invasion:Earth explores first contact from alien species in a way we've not seen before, two warring alien species colliding with ours.  Just when you think you've figured it out, wham, there's a new twist.  This is a plot driven series, something the Brits do best.  Invasion:Earth doesn't rely on monosyllabic characters and stacks of mind numbing visual effects in order to keep us engaged; it introduces a complex plot and characters with depth.  The series is moody, rather like early X-Files meets ""V"", and often what we don't see, is more terrifying that what we do.  The direction is tight, the acting, for the most part, is top notch and although there is a predictable subplot romance between two of the main characters that falls into maudlin sentimentality there is enough of a focus on the actual story at hand to make this no more than a passing irritation.  Predictably, Phyllis Logan shines as Sqd. Ldr. Helen Knox and although her role is a secondary one it is clear that her acting is the most refined.  She is decisive, gritty and has a piercing stare that reaches right out and stings you.  She never wavers for a moment.  It is also gratifying to see a woman given the command of an RAF base for once.  Invasion:Earth comes to its final conclusion in an incredibly realistic way; there are no easy answers, and although there is plenty of heroism there is no perfect Hollywood finale complete with a pounding musical score to tug at our emotions.  Some of the dialouge is over the top, especially that delivered by Fred Ward, and the story, trying to span two time periods, may be slightly over ambitious.  Invasion:Earth is definitely worth a second look.  You won't be disappointed.",975024000,4,1818,4.748407643312102
987518,4,6305196311,"Following in the tradition established by Nigel Keane and the Quatermass series (particularly Quartermass And The Pit), this well done science fiction miniseries captures the attention of the viewer by telling a tale  of first contact with a number of unique twists. The sinister nature of  first contact has never been explored in science fiction film in quite this  fashion.
The title, although accurate, doesn't begin to do the program  justice (and, in fact, sounds a little cheesy). While the plot is well  thought out and imaginative, the characters are to real people what an  impressionist is to the original person he or she is imitating; a  collection of quirks, mixed with a dash of persona and topped with cliched  reactions.
Still, despite its shortcomings, the film does dazzle with the  intelligence and imagination of the plot. This is a story well told,  although it would have been even more satisfying if the characters that  participated in the telling were a little more realistic.
The direction  is precise and controlled. Every scene creates additional tension as the  alien's intentions become clear. The fourth act is quite a shocker and,  unlike most science fiction films, there is no easy resolution. This isn't  really designed for folks who find Doctor Who or Red Dwarf to be the  ultimate in BBC science fiction fare. Instead, this program is designed to  challenge viewers, entertain them, but also present the hard choices the  world might really face if the same situation really occured.

Most of the characters are well crafted, and the story is innovative, combining some interesting elements of science (fiction) with well-paced plotting. The  overall story works. The love interest sub-plot vies over a range from  interesting drama to annoying dialogue/acting, but it is endurable.

I expected a basic B grade alien conspiracy tale and was pleasantly surprised to find the story and production quality was first class.
Once I started I could not turn it off and got so absorbed in the plot that I watched the whole series in one day.

I love most stories about aliens esspecially when they have some mystery and intrigue, It's a bonus when the plot is well executed by a mixture of well known actors and a few unknowns with promise.

987576,4,6305196311,"I enjoyed this too-brief British series for presenting the idea of an alien threat that seemed, after repeated attempts at examination by the central characters, simply too overwhelming--while the warnings of a far-flung alien visitor are mostly dismissed. A key fact central to the whole endgame involving one character is never explicitly stated and you have to come to the realization she does herself on your own.

987609,5,6305196311,"Rather!  Like a series recently reviewed here and for which I was thoroughly bashed by a few who disagreed.  That series was found wanting in writing and set design.  This series, completely different mind you, is found to be delightful.  Thanks to the involvement of the British military, this story has a strong impression of aunthenticity.  Thanks to where it is filmed one is able to enjoy glimpses of glorious untouched Scottish countryside. At least this writer hopes the Scottish countryside is still untouched. I would not recommend this series for children viewing it alone as a few scenes might be disturbing to them.  But for the rest, the stories keep you watching.  The acting, even of Fred Ward, is really very good.  Some of the characters are a bit cliche but even they work very well here.  All in all alot more entertaining that that other series I so correctly criticized recently and I don't even like sci-fi very much.  I recommend this gem for a stormy night with the family, tiny children excluded or talked through the scarey bits, or on your own that day you are home from work with that head cold you can't shake without staying in bed.

It's more Si Fi drma than battles in space, although the ""alliens"" are violent and quite horrifying.  The plot reminded me of an episode from the 1960's Outer Limit series.  It's a rather dark film, both thematically and visually, but the writing is tight and acting solid.  Apparently, it was a big budget miniseries via the combined forces of the Si Fi Channel and BBC Scotland.  It's drawback?

987616,4,6305196311,"Alien invasion movies are a dime a dozen, but only a few linger in the memory. INVASION EARTH is one such. This is a BBC production and as usual the producers, writers, director and cast combine to present the unlikely as near possible. Originally shot as a six part mini-series, INVASION EARTH is a gripping drama told in occasional flasback. During WWII, a British lieutenant discovers a humanoid figure emerge from what appears a spaceship in bombed out London. He disappears from the plot only to reappear decades later (minus aging due to near light speed) as an observer who has devastating news for modern day England. At first, he is thought to be of an alien species, but he slowly convinces the military that the real threat comes from a weird spiderlike species that has mastery of multi-dimensional transportation and is determined to terraform the earth in a manner suitable for their own life form. Maggie O'Neill is Dr. Tucker, a civilian scientist who is first kidnapped by the aliens called NDs then released for a reason which I shall not reveal here. Vincent Regan is a British pilot who is her love interest and helps prepare a defense. Fred Ward is General Reese, a tough as nails American on loan to NATO who supervises the entire operation.

Each episode relies heavily on the interactions among the large cast, many of whom are quirky enough to retain our interest. FX are minimal. We see only glimpses of the NDs, who resemble impossibly high leaping spiders. We further see a few scenes where kidnapped humans are kept as prisoners while suspended in an amorphous miasma of tree-like branches. The NDs have conquered one civilization after another with the earth as the latest potential victim.  All the others have gone quietly and with minimal resistance.  General Reese in the final episode sets the proper tone when he notes that human beings have an ungodly habit of making life difficult for would be conquerors. The ending, of course, is the showdown, although a few reviewers have commented on what they saw as a lack of finality almost as if the series' ending and future life on British television was not decided until late and an indeterminate closure was filmed. Such criticism, I think, misses the point that in time of a clear and present threat to human survival, a plan of defense might very likely go through the stages of disbelief, then acceptance, then grim determination that INVASION EARTH suggests might be the norm. I learned to care about the cast regardless of their fate. Only the better dramas of any sort manage to do that.",1239321600,4,2579,4.804054054054054
987617,2,6305196311,"The story had some good elements and the acting, mostly, was OK. However, I found the show rather dull to watch. I think I would say the directing lacked any ability to engage the audience or to excite the actors. Some later episodes had rather painful dialogue as well, with just bad directing. The CGI was fairly good, though, and the cinematography had some good moments.

I guess I got my $15 worth in 6 hours of mildly amusing entertainment. I would only recommend to direhard SF fans, though.  I'll likely not watch again as I usually do with SF shows, at least for many years.",1234137600,3,583,4.490566037735849
987618,2,6305196311,"I had the displeasure of watching this on Netflix (not Netflix's fault I suppose).  We start out on a battlefield in England circa WWII.  There's a crashed UFO.  Why?  We don't know.  An alien comes running out of there.  Why?  Where's he going?  Doesn't matter, the bobby shoots him.  His boss tells him to lay off the other one who's struggling in the dirt.

Then, inexplicably, we jump to ""present day"".  Why?  We don't know.

We're introduced to a few crack pilots of the RAF.  We don't feel much for them with their acting bored and bad casting.  Two jets take off in pursuit of the UFO.  They're ordered to observe only.

Then one of the pilots shoots it down!  It explodes and an escape pod flies out and lands in Scotland of all places.  Meanwhile, the pilot, before he started shooting was told by several people including his commanding officers not to engage and not to fire, yet he did it anyway.  His excuse?  ""You weren't there, you don't know, you had to be there.""  GAD!

Amanda, the gal who runs a SETI operation, doesn't want to tell anyone about her discovery of the signals that were coming from the saucer before it exploded.  Why?  Some kind of revenge thing, not explained.

At the end, (don't worry about spoilers, I'm saving you, believe me) some warpy thing pops out and eats the alien pilot who somehow landed in the hospital.  How?  Why?  Don't know.

I like invasion films, but they have to make sense!

The characters were not compelling to me.  The plotline was very contrived.  The romance unbelievable.  I could not imagine why anyone would want to be with either of these two. Perhaps that was intended - a sort of nod to the idea that there is someone for everyone.

However, it is the plot holes that really spoiled it for me.  We have a civilian consultant who has apparently unrestricted access to a military base.  In one scene she is in the military hospital being examined and the general in charge demands to know from the doctor what she has found wrong with her (she's been changed by the aliens) as if knowing that is the key to the mystery.  The doctor replies that she'll keep him informed of each new batch of tests, saying that they only have two hours (or somesuch) of data.  It is very intense, and I got the impression that they are drawing blood every hour or so.  Then, they cut to the village where the patient in the last scene is now walking freely about helping to look into the problems there.  Apparently they did not need her in the hospital to keep running the tests as ordered.

The show was full of things like that, where I was left going 'huh?'  Perhaps it was meant to be a few hours longer and had to be edited down?  Either way, poking fun of it became a way to make it bearable - like our own Mystery Science Theatre...  We managed to sit through the entire thing, simply because my husband is the sort that has to know how a story ends.",1176940800,9,1632,4.267100977198697

There are two alien races.  The Echo are peaceful and want to warn the Earth about the dimension-hopping NDs.  A NATO General gets put in charge of the escape craft and its occupant.  While he is quickly convinced of the existence of aliens, there is no real hard proof that his superiors accept.  But if the General is right, the NDs have been tainting the Earth's water supplies for the past fifty years but with the downing of the Echo craft, they are stepping up the campaign.

The NDs civilization is based upon the manipulation of living matter.  They take over worlds where life is present.  Earth may have an intelligence but that means nothing to the NDs.  They will go about harvesting humans as they need them.  Finally the extent of their plans is revealed and NATO command accepts the existence of the alien threat.  But it is still up to a small handful of people to develop the strategies against the aliens and carry them out.

Although the plot is similar and the title is identical to Harry Harrison's novel INVASION: EARTH, there is no credit given and the story soon deviates drastically from Harrison's.  While the special effects are good, it is the solid acting and drama that drives this mini-series.  I really enjoyed the acting and the way the plot unfolded.

But if you're looking for a Dr. Who stylish sci-fi thriller with dark overtures of an invading alien race, this is exactly what you get.  The Brits and Sci-Fi channel have a hit that should have produced another series, but like all 'thinking' shows, it didn't produce the numbers they wanted.  I've watched it several times over the years and still enjoy the plot.  Like I said before, just enjoy it for what it is, not for what you'd like it to be.  Excellent series.",1120348800,2,563,4.480392156862745

7885056,3,6305196311,"The BBC mini-series Invasion Earth (1989) incorporates some interesting ideas in its 6 episode run, before it abruptly ends.  With a rather complicated plot, the series begins with some promise, but unravels rather badly by the end, making it difficult to recommend watching.

Events are centered in Scotland, where Flight Lt. Chris Drake (Vincent Regan) shoots down an unidentified flying craft.  Drake joins forces with Dr. Amanda Tucker (Maggie O'Neill), and the pair become attached to NATO Major General David Reece (Fred Ward,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remo-Williams-The-Adventure-Begins/dp/B000092Q5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins</a>), the commander of a joint force base in Scotland.  Charles Tyrell (Anton Lester), a survivor from the downed UFO, is a discovered to be a traveler from the past, where he was a British soldier during World War II.

Aliens dubbed the ""nD's"", appear on Earth travelling through portals from another dimension.  They abduct several humans including Dr. Tucker, and conduct procedures on them, before eventually returning them.  Through Tyrell, the team learns that there is also another alien race involved.  The story just becomes more and more complicated, and includes a predictable romance between Tucker and Drake.

The special effects are elevated in the final episodes, and numerous elements are drawn together, but not in a very credible or satisfying manner.  At the conclusion, it seems that the filmmakers decided to bail, and knock all the chess pieces off the board.  If this series has sunk into obscurity, there may be good reasons why, as it just doesn't measure up very well.  If you are really interested in this miniseries, rather than the VHS format, you might want to check for its availability on Amazon Instant Video, where it is currently available for free to Prime members.",1423958400,,1921,5.631944444444445
