that include a British Lady, a monk and a security guard.
Here he takes the case of a Peruvian gold ring and finds trouble with an high tech retinal scan safe.
The action is tame compared to American TV.",1234051200,,266,4.448979591836735

7849413,5,6303522351,"Lovejoy mysteries are the best in cinematography, writing, acting - Where are the other 75 episodes of Lovejoy?  Probably sitting in some lawyer's safe.  We are lucky to even have the four A&E tapes and we have even asked about him in East Anglia, where many Brits still remember the wonderful hour-long episodes.  If only someone could put all of the episodes on tape!  We miss him terribly!

7849414,5,6303522351,"First, I really like the reviews I have read about this box set.  They seem to come from the sort of people I always knew loved Lovejoy -- intelligent and fun and able to spell correctly.  I, too, mourn the passing of Lovejoy from my Monday nights.  I don't think there has ever been a show with so many delicate components all mixed together so well.  --  This line-up includes the original cast, Lovejoy, Tinker, Eric and Lady Felsham (the later cast was great, too, with Charlotte Cavendish supplying much-needed romance to Lovejoy's life), and they are so well suited to one another and play with obvious affection that it makes this show that much more fun to watch.  Honestly, I used to watch the show just for the beautiful country locations, which are used to enormous effect.  If this set is still available, do yourself a favor and buy it and bask in one of the most exciting and charming shows England ever produced.",1103241600,8,927,4.581818181818182
7849415,5,6303522351,"These four episodes are from the middle two of a six year series.  The series started out as a mystery and became an adventure-comedy.  It is all about the problems an antique dealer can find himself in.  The classical British characteristic of there being several subplots that converge at the end of the episode is frequently used.  All of the characters are interesting and eccentric.  There is a lot of subtle verbal humor. Various archetypes of British culture are lampooned.  All problems are solved in civilized ways without confrontative or other lower class behavior.  There is no sex, violence, car chases, or loud rapid tempo music. My favorite character, Lady Felsham, impresses me with her high level of integrity.  She always expresses her feelings verbally and by body language so that there is no ambiguity.  She is a good example of how personality traits mean more than flashy body shapes in making a woman desirable.",1035331200,18,935,4.980645161290322
7849416,5,6303522351,"Structurally, LOVEJOY is MAGNUM, P.I. on a different island.  A good-hearted rogue and his two scruffy friends are beholden to a wealthy financier, and through the practice of his craft, this rogue and his friends always seem to be on the trail of some criminal activity.  To help propel the storytelling, the main character occasionally breaks the fourth wall and narrates events.  If there's any real difference in the basic structure between the two shows it's that Lovejoy is in love with his financier.  But then again Magnum's Mr. Higgins is (mostly) as unavailable as Lovejoy's Lady Jane.
Still, they say that there are only a few basic stories in the world, and that the skill is in the telling.  If that be true, then there's enough originality here to make it more than worth a visit.  The fact that Lovejoy is an antiques expert is a keen part of the difference.  There's something a bit more interesting about an antiques dealer than a simple P.I.  Because of the antiques focus, most of the stories tend to take place amongst the British upper class, and so stunning Hawaiian vistas are substituted with gorgeous old estates.  Also as the nature of the crimes tend to be art related, it's often more difficult to work out the mystery here than with an episode of Magnum.
Whether the particular episodes on offer in this package are truly the ""best"" of LOVEJOY is an open question.  To be sure, ""Love Knots"" is fascinating stuff, and ""Scotch on the Rocks"" has moments of brilliant fun.  But there's not much here which really helps define the central characters for us.  Many episodes throughout the run of LOVEJOY delved into the backgrounds and relationships of the main characters, but I'm not sure any of the ones here do much in that regard.  Having said that, these may be among the very best pure mysteries in the lot.",984614400,25,1837,4.703125
