1421417,2,B00005B6K7,"If you're looking to learn how to play songs from Are You Experienced, you're better off buying Andy Aledort's ""Jimi Hendrix - A Step By Step Breakdown of His Guitar Styles and Techniques"" book and CD for [PRICE].  The problem with this DVD is that while Andy obviously knows his stuff, he spends less than 5 minutes per song (they cram all 17 songs into 2 hours) and there's no real ""analysis"" of how to even play it.  What's worse is that there's no on-screen transcription of what Andy is playing -- he just plays and you're expected to mimic what you see.  You might as well get a Hendrix concert DVD and learn from that.  A better idea would have been to package the book I mentioned above with this DVD.",1040428800,10,709,4.348484848484849
1421418,5,B00005B6K7,"This DVD is definitely worth buying if you're a Hendrix fan. Velvet Turner and Andy Aledort go through each song on Are You Experienced and discuss the basic elements of the song. The tone that Andy Aledort gets from his Strat is absolutely excellent. The downside is that they did not discuss what equipment they were using. Although you can tell by looking at Andy's guitar that he's playing a 68 Reverse Headstock Strat, also known as the Hendrix Voodoo Strat. But I strongly feel that these videos should discuss equipment also.",1037491200,2,532,4.793478260869565
1421419,2,B00005B6K7,"It pains me to give only two stars to this slick dvd because in a lot of ways I really like it. The problem is the instruction style. I bought this to learn the solos. They spend next to zero time explaining what they are actually doing. For example, instead of saying ""put your first finger on the seventh fret of the A string and slide down to the fifth fret of the A string"", they simple play a portion of the song and then replay it again somewhat slower (which is still too fast for me.) During the solos, you can't tell exactly what the guitarist is doing. That got the rating to 3 stars in my opinion. I bumped it down to 2 stars because of the huge price tag.

On a more positive note, it is really cool to watch this guy play Hendrix (even if you can't ascertain everything he is doing.) Also, you can definitely pick up a few things that are very helpful. I eventually succeeded learning some Hendrix solos by using the Hal Leonard Hendrix Smash Hits book (comes with tabs and a CD.) I will say that after learning the solo by using the Leonard book tabs, and then returning to this dvd, I did find it more interesting for my purposes. However, trying to learn Hendrix solos using this dvd alone is very time consuming and frustrating.

I guess the bottom line is that this DVD is more of a refinement tool than anything else.",1246924800,2,1336,4.255905511811024
1421420,1,B00005B6K7,"I bought this DVD to accompany the tab book I already have. Whereas tabs are note for note, this DVD presents the BARE SKELETON of the songs. You won't play like Hendrix, you will play a dumbed down version that does not do Hendrix justice. I have the Electric LadyLand DVD and it is way more informative, illustrative, and you play LIKE HENDRIX-NOTE FOR NOTE! I returned this DVD, it's too much money, and the lessons often are shorter than the song they are supposed to ""teach."" It's horrible....",1242086400,2,498,4.606741573033708
1421421,4,B00005B6K7,"Though not as in depth and complete as Andy Aledort's coverage of the Axis:Bold as Love album, this Dvd does offer some insights and quick lessons to cover Hendrix's first LP. The narration by Velvet Turner sounds like he's reading it for the first time, but so what. The only real complaint is that this comparatively weak treatment is priced at 59.95. While Axis initially sold at 9.95, (now 14.95) it is quite complete and over 3 hours long. What's with dat? Anyway, you'll definitely glean some insight and learn a thing or two, even if you are.....er,Experienced...",1235865600,2,570,4.826530612244898
1421422,5,B00005B6K7,"I have this and Andy Aledort's Axis DVD. Both are the best way to truly learn Hendrix songs inside and out.  Andy is probably the foremost educator on Hendrix's material and has toured with the Experience's surviving members Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell.

The only thing I would add is that you really should have the tab book to go along with the DVD.  It doesn't come with any tab.  Some of this stuff is tricky to learn by watching - even if you're backing up the sections numerous times.  The tab helps a lot.  And no matter what, Hendrix's material is not the easiest to lean so there is a lot here to wrestle with.  But all the material is analyzed in a way that makes sense and is pretty straight forward.

Aledort has the Electric Ladyland DVD coming out soon, and I'm very anxious to pick it up as soon as it's released.  These are the best instructional videos I have seen.",1227571200,,892,4.325301204819277
1421423,5,B00005B6K7,"If you've ever wanted to learn to play like Jimi Hendrix This DVD is for you! Andy Aledort takes you step by step through Jimi's Songs with complete accuracy. Andy nails Jimi's Sounds and Licks, and performs them ""Up to Speed"" & ""Slowed Down"". You'll learn how to play Jimi's ""Backwards"" solo's ""Forward""... that alone will blow your friends minds! This is for the intermediate and advanced guitarist, and I would also recommend picking up a copy of the ""Are you Experienced"" songbook, there are quite a few tricky rhythmic figures and it's good to see them visually. With 2 hours of instruction, this is a must for any Hendrix enthusiast. So what are you waiting...

1421424,5,B00005B6K7,"I was very (extremely) skeptical at the time of purchase...

My past experience with these ""Learn from the Masters"" DVD's had not been very good. And at roughly $50 a pop, I didn't particularly want to be ""dork of the month,"" acquiring some mediocre lessons & renditions of Jimi's first album.

Having shelled out the $50 Samolians, I must confess to being very pleasantly surprised. Andy Aledort does about as good a job of demonstrating how to play Jimi as anyone reasonably could. For the most part, even his position on the neck seemed to be remarkably accurate. This is the kind of DVD which you want to spend a few hours on each song, learning it note-for-note, and then make it your own. After all, it's got to flow, baby!!

I agree with several of the other reviewers who suggest that a solid background in basic music theory and some decent blues chops are required to get the most from this package.

But I must respectfully disagree with the gentleman who gave this DVD a low-rating simply because Mr. Aledort failed demonstrate some of the crazy sound effects Jimi produced in the studio. This would more likely be the pervue of the audio engineer and the producer (Eddie Kramer & Chas Chandler) than Aledort. If you want to get a glimpse into the ""Studio Magic"" stuff, I would recommend the Historic Albums DVD of the Making of the Electric Ladyland album with Eddie Kramer, Jack Cassidy and Buddy Miles.

If you put in enough time on the Andy Aledort DVD, I doubt you'll be disappointed. I inflicted ""Third Stone From The Sun"" on the guys in the band, and it works great playing live.",1218758400,,1598,4.5929824561403505
1421425,3,B00005B6K7,"It was a big mistake to include Velvert Turner in the release.  He's a huge distraction who contributes little aside from awkwardly reading things obviously written for him. Andy Aledort is mute throughout the DVD but it's he who undoubtedly did all the work and he should have had the freedom to present this material as he saw fit. I guess Velvert is a family friend who knew Jimi at some point?

The DVD's really for entertainment and curiosity purposes.....",1206576000,2,461,4.75
1421426,1,B00005B6K7,"I should have listened to some of the bad reviews. One review said that they spend about 5 minutes per songs. I think it's more like 4. They don't ""Teach"" you anything. They just show you how Jimi played the song. Thats great and all but I'm not Jimi Hendrix. I would like to learn how to play like him, but the DVD does not teach. It actually gets annoying after a while because Velvert Turner, just keeps saying. Jimi then does this, Jimi then does that. Like I said before I'm not Jimi. The guitarist that plays the guitar to show you what Velvert Turner is talking about, just plays. I have to constantly play the DVD in slow motion but then I can't hear the sound. I hate this product. I also bought the book because the book has the TAB's and sheet music for the songs. The Book is excellent. I wish I had never bought the DVD, I spent $50 and I can't return it. BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1200009600,4,900,4.238372093023256
1421427,5,B00005B6K7,"If you are interested in playing all the music from Hendrix' first album ""Are You Experienced"", then this DVD will show you how.  All the chords, riffs and solos are taught at tempo and also slowed down so you won't miss a thing.  Good for all levels but especially suited for intermediate level guitar players.  I guarantee you'll be saying to yourself ""so THAT's how he did it!"".",1179446400,,381,4.573529411764706
1421428,2,B00005B6K7,"Andy Aledort is an old hand at transcribing, and his work is always of a very high standard. His knowledge of Hendrix's work (as exhibited in a range of published Hendrix articles) is exceptional indeed.

Thus one wonders why he became involved in this DVD production. Only sections of the songs are taught, there is no notation (either  standard or tablature), and Velvert Turner's stilted recitation of musical information from cue cards is annoying. Why is he even necessary? Great, he took instruction from Hendrix - but his name is rarely mentioned in Hendrix circles and he appears to be no musical authority on the man's music.

Aledort is an exceptionally talented guitar player, and the DVD would be of a much higher standard if he alone presented the material, as well as providing gear tips and notation. As it stands, large sections of the songs are left unexamined, leaving beginners entirely in the dark. The DVD also assumes one is adept at discerning complex finger placements from merely watching Aledort play each section. Even when played slowly, Hendrix's chord construction, rhythm stylings and solos require a good degree of musicianship from the student.

The material that IS presented is enjoyable to watch, but it falls far short in instructional terms. If you want to play the music of Hendrix, buy the transcription book to 'Are You Experienced?' and puzzle it out yourself. This DVD will only take you half way there, leaving you furiously disappointed in the end.

A shoddy release that Mr. Aledort should be somewhat ashamed of.",1148688000,12,1559,4.980769230769231
1421429,4,B00005B6K7,"You want to know the secrets of how to play like Jimi? Tabs don't cut it and you can't find a good note for note transcription because many of these things are not really transcribable. You have listened to every recording available a million times and know he never plays anything the same way twice. Then you research all the guitars and effects and amps, recording techniques, pictures, interviews and movies available and you are still mystified. Well you are not alone my friend. People study Jimi for a lifetime and still ask ""How did he do that""??? I have bought a couple of guitar videos for other artists and they were a little disappointing or misleading. This is the best one I've ever seen and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is it didn't answer all my questions about what amp and effects settings the person was using and some little parts were left out on how some things were done. Don't let that bother you. It is very complete. There is a lifetime of learning on this video and the songs and licks are explained and shown to you in fast and in slow motion. In truth you would be lucky to be able to play as well as the instructor let alone Hendrix. If you want to learn Jimi note for note this is as close as you are going to get. It will only reinforce your feeling of why he is considered a genius.  Remember the real trick is playing it with feeling. Buy it, you won't feel ripped off, though perhaps a little humbled.

1421430,1,B00005B6K7,"I am quite let down by advertising the inclusion of backing tracks to sell this DVD. It is also printed on the DVD back cover.

Quote: ""There are backing tracks to each song so you can play along.""

Uh....where are they?

I have written to Hal Leonard asking this very question and so far no response. The phrase; false advertising comes to the mind. As a consumer I find little to appreciate in being misled. Perhaps there is a good explanation, but I don't know what it is. A response from the publisher would be helpful. It should be rectified.

Based on this issue and since there is only one rating system in place I am giving this DVD one star.

Despite that, based on Andy Aledort's virtuosity and Velvet Turner's efforts, the attention to detail and accuracy, this is a remarkable DVD.

The song renditions include split screen for right hand. Rhythm parts for the solo work are also included. Want to learn how to play the backwards solo from Are You Experienced? Andy shows you how to emulate the backwards solo playing normally. Remarkable actually. Andy Aledort's work here is truly a treasure and this DVD is a must have for anyone interested in exploring Jimi's approach to guitar.

I have found only one small nitpicking complaint. The camera angle on the left hand is off just enough to make it difficult to pick up what is going on sometimes with the fingering. You can still get it but I found it requires more effort.",1144540800,15,1436,4.56420233463035
1421431,5,B00005B6K7,"Let me start by stating that I read tab pretty well, I've been studying with an excellent instructor for about a year, and I'm a real bug about getting the stuff I play to sound 'right'. By right, I mean that it needs to have at least the same feel and close phrasing - doesn't have to be mechanically note for note. But, sometimes, to capture the feel of a multitrack recording with a single guitar you have to make allowances for the exactness. Still, it has to sound right, and sound good.

Secondly, this deserves more than 5 stars.

I've got several different tab sources on Hendrix, a DVD by another (excellent) instructor, and have been working on a couple of Jimi tunes. Thought I had at least the scaled-back versions down pretty good. I've watched most of this set once-through now, and it left my jaw on the floor. The richness of the detail blew me a-way. By the time you're through the 2nd or 3rd song in the set, you'll be glad they chopped them up into measure and gave you half-speed demos so you wouldn't miss any detail. Even the rhythm parts need to be slowed down so you can see what is going on. As for not having tab - heck, go get it. Then you'll have the best of both worlds (but this world is better, trust me!).

I grew up with Hendrix music; I know the stuff in my head, almost by heart. But the theory explanations by Velvert Turner combined with the dead-on normal and half-speed split-screen demos by Andy are a goldmine for what they reveal.

How the music is phrased is a HUGE part of the sound, and you're not going to get that from just the tab. Seeing it performed here, with close-up fretwork and the split inset screen for the picking and strumming gives you that. That's hard to find, and heaven knows why anyone would knock it.

The delivery in the set feels choppy at times because of breaking the songs down a few measures at a time. But the sonic landscape of Jimi's work is so rich and thick that I don't see how else they could do it and still keep our heads from exploding! Bear in mind that many tab sources you're going to get are essentially going to be the ""easy guitar"" version of these songs, not the real deal details with full and half-speed demos in digestible pieces.

As for getting it from a concert - fuggedaboudit! Besides the period quality problems with most Hendrix footage, you have to realize that there are problems with the directorial idea of what makes for good entertainment. That usually conflicts with what makes for a good instructional source. For comparison, go rent SRV's Live at the El Macambo and see how much you can glean of how to play Stevie from that, even though it was capture with much better technology and much more recently. Or, get ""Lightning in a Bottle"" and see if you can figure out much about the masterful acoustic version of ""Can't Be Satisfied"" that Buddy Guy plays. Concert footage was not shot to teach you how to play, and there is NO freakin' way this should dismissed in favor of old concert footage as a training aid. You'd need your head examined if you did that.

I'd strongly recommend the DVD version of this set so that you can go directly to your favorite section. Also, some DVD players will let you step through at varying speeds and loop a given segment over and over. Trust me - on some of those Jimi solos you're going to want to have those extra tech tools handy!

I simply am AMAZED that anyone panned this set. It is a gem of source material for anyone that truly wants to play Hendrix so it will should like it should. Can't imagine WHAT they were expecting to be so dissappointed by it. So far as I know there isn't anything else out there like it. If there is - Axis or Ladyland - I WANT it.",1139011200,31,3710,4.351156069364162
1421432,5,B00005B6K7,"The best way to gain insight into a musician's work is to learn to play it yourself. Although no one can duplicate the ""magical something"" which set Hendrix, arguable the greatest blues guitarist ever, apart, this wonderful DVD goes a long way in exploring the physical technique he used. Grab a strat, crank your marshall on 10, drop the DVD into the player and ""bow down before a master"". Essential educational material for any guitarist interested in the Hendrix canon.",1133740800,,472,4.9125
1421433,3,B00005B6K7,be aware that contrary to the cover the dvd does not contain backing tracks for you to play along with,1117065600,7,102,4.15
1421434,5,B00005B6K7,"Let me start saying that I had used Instructional VHS/DVDs for a couple of years including the ""MVP In The Style Of"" series and some other ones featuring modern guitar virtuosos like Al DiMeola, Paul Gilbert and Eric Johnson. The MVP series is crap, but was one of the first ones available. The others are good but follow a presentation that only acomplished guitarrist will benifit the most. Imagine going to a one Day workshop with your favorite guitarrist.

This DVD is the Best one yet. You have two great instructors, one playing the tunes, one explaining the tunes. They cover all the songs from the are you experience album and all the parts of the songs: Intros, Verses, Chorus, Solo, etc. The explanations included some basic theoric explanitions of the scales and roots of the songs or passages inside the songs as well as right hand, left hand techniques need to acomplish the sounds.

If you are an advanced beginner, know some basic theory, right/left hand techniques and understand the minor and major pentatonic scales you will benefit greatly from this DVD.

Those Hendrix fans who are intermidate and advanced guitarrist can probably incorporate some of these songs to their gigs in little time!

The only con that ther is is that there is no tablature, but you can get the Tab Book from amazon for around $20. Yet I had the book before I got this DVD but was very diffucult to use as nothing compares to actualy seeing some one playing the songs to get a grasp of the right/left hand techniques which is somethig difficult to do from a Tab Book.",1108598400,22,1563,4.672727272727273
1421435,5,B00005B6K7,"I read the positive and negative reviews prior to ordering this DVD. I already own the Jimi Hendrix Experience tab book. What the tabs don't give you is the what I would call the ""correct form"".(Being a Novice Player). I have struggled with the lead to the Wind Cries Mary for a long time. Just getting this straightened out  was woth the cost of this DVD. Hopefully Vekvert Turner is working on releasing another DVD with other Jimi Hendrix songs. I do highly recommend purchasing the Tabs in addition to this DVD. Between the book and the DVD you are sure to get it right. I am very glad I purchased this DVD.",1104883200,6,611,4.407079646017699
1421436,5,B00005B6K7,"I've bought other Hendrix lessons that play ""in the style"" of Jimi and was greatly disappointed. Heck, I could have made better ones than those and those aren't approved by Jimi's estate. This DVD was sanctioned by the Experience Hendrix, LLC Company and for good reason. It is the greatest translation of Jimi's songs on the planet....bar none! I am now proud to say that as a direct result of this DVD I am starting my own Jimi Hendrix Tribute Band called Are You Experienced. This DVD nails every single note with unerring accuracy to the point it had me shaking in my boots to see that some human could actually ever duplicate Jimi's songs with such total exactness. For me, watching Andy Aledort play the notes fast and then slow was all I needed. That's the beauty of DVDs! Just hit pause, jump back a second or two and no tapes wearing out and rewinding. What's so difficult about that? If they were to go into an ""analysis"" of Jimi's rapid fire lightening solos for 17 songs as Lloyd mentions, it would take many DVDs at probably a cost of several thousand dollars. Even so, for me being a Hendrix fanatic, I would have gladly payed over a grand for this DVD alone because after 30 years of practicing these songs by ear I have never been able to duplicate these songs to this level and now I can! Every part, chord, intro, solo and outro is there note for note. There is also brief analysis before each song and part introduced by Velvert Turner and then played by Andy Aledort with fantastic brief footage of Jimi playing live in between that I've never seen before. That amazing footage was probably supplied by Jimi's estate but don't quote me on that. I went out and bought the tabs companion book as well, but having never learned tabs and playing by ear for the past 30 years it all looks Greek to me. Not knocking tabs and Andy himself encouraged me to learn them, but I'd rather watch and hear somebody play something any day than read tabs and not understand the feeling or intensity something is played at. That's right...Andy himself. I wrote to Guitar World where he is an editor and he immediately answered all my questions about equipment used etc. which was nothing out of the ordinary that is already plastered all over the net about equipment Jimi used such as a Fender Strat, a Marshall Plexi, an Octavia, Clyde McCoy Wah, Univibe, etc. The majority of the sound however, comes from the intensity, syntax and execution at which the notes are played and that's what this DVD nails down to the tee. Lloyd also mentioned that you might as well go out and buy a Hendrix concert DVD and watch Jimi playing the notes. Good luck! Almost every Hendrix concert ever filmed is poor quality, dark, grainy, focuses on his strumming hand instead of his neck playing fingers or his feet during his most killer solos, with the exception of Woodstock which shows a few great riffs in bits and pieces. If you want to learn Jimi's songs note for note, this is the factotum DVD to get. If tabs are your bag, get the companion book. However, get the DVD if you want to see and hear it being played firsthand, which is almost mandatory if you want to try and duplicate Hendrix exactly, this DVD will definitely show you how to get REALLY Experienced!",1091836800,21,3256,4.520338983050848

Guitarist Andy Aledort is close, but he's not spot on. I gave this 3 stars because he's the only reason for purchasing this otherwise insipid ""play along"" tutorial. The narrator, one Velvert Turner, is incredibly annoying and adds nothing to this DVD. He's obviously reading from a teleprompter and he didn't even bother to learn the material or practice public speaking before boring us to death with his lame introductions to the licks. He was brought in, ostensibly, to help sell this DVD because he attended a bunch of Hendrix concerts and met him his several times before Jimi hit the big time, but it works against making this ""OK"" DVD an ""awesome"" DVD. I'm still trying to figure out how to cut him out of all the tutorials so that I end up with just Andy showing us the chops. Andy is pretty good - he's really close - but I found a few obvious mistakes.

Despite the wide ranging reviews from ""hate it"" to ""its the greatest thing ever"".....I have to say its a good tool. But you have to be ready to understand it. It doesn't exactly spoon feed you....just tells you what is happening and shows it. You can see it clearly and hear it clearly. It doesn't include any tab, transcriptions etc.

I deducted 1 star for the excessive price and lack of any other materials besides the DVD at that price point.

PROs
-------------------------------
- The best thing about this is that you can clearly hear the guitar parts and see someone playing them in the correct positions on the neck. I've always found the guitar work on the original album is masked considerably by the vocals and other instruments. It doesn't stand out as much as I'd like in order to hear it clearly and learn it so this DVD provides what the original recording can't.

- This album contains several of the most popular hits Hendrix had, and for that reason it is a great starting point.

- It also contains other songs that were not ""hits"" but offer some interesting licks and tricks you can apply elsewhere and 80%-95% of your audience won't even know you're ripping off Hendrix. It will just sound cool.

- The verbal song descriptions are actually essentially ""song notes"" that a pro musician might write up when analyzing a new song they are studying or teaching. They are delivered matter of factly, and quickly. If this stuff doesn't make sense, slow down and take each sentence one at a time and make sure you understand what is being said. If it sounds like junk to you, you probably just aren't at the point of being ready for this yet. Take it slowly it and in time it will come.

- These demonstrations are note for note accurate to what Hendrix played on the recordings. You would think that would always be true for professionally published DVD's and books, but it isn't...and especially on Hendrix stuff I have noticed other DVDs that range from ""ok approximations"" to terrible interpretations. If you want to play the songs correctly and actually study what Hendrix was doing exactly....this is the best tool I've found. You need to couple it with the transcription book, the original recordings, and probably some software tools for slowing down the original audio and DVD video, and looping on sections.

CONs
-------------------------------
- Overpriced by about 2X

- There are no transcriptions, written or onscreen. But if you buy the transcription for this album, it matches what's being shown (at least the parts I've looked at so far.)

- Despite what some viewers have said, there ARE backing tracks....they are the tracks played after the ""lesson"". They are just poorly organized. You can't just say - click on the solo for Hey Joe - and pull that up and play it over and over.

- The Rhythm sections are not really covered as well on some songs as I'd like to see.

- The lack of gear descriptions such as effects in use or amps/guitars hendrix used in recording the album is a minor disappointment. I'm sure I can find it elsewhere but for the price, would have expected more of that kind of background to be included. I think on some songs they mention an effect or two but I'm not sure its consistently applied. It would have also been interesting to hear more about the differences between how the songs were recorded, and how Jimi then transferred that to the stage for live play because some of the studio tricks are not possible on stage (like overdubs and running a tape backwards).

- It's not well structured for a beginner. Then again if you are beginner, you need to recognize that while you probably WANT to play Jimi, you may only be ready for ""Go tell Aunt Rhody"". That said, I recommend you still pick 1 song you love and work on the part you like best.

SUMMARY
-----------------------------
Overall, I think this is a very good tool for learning Hendrix tunes and techniques. It will almost certainly increase your insight into the music. Unless you are extremely good at watching someone else's hands on a guitar and learning exactly what they are doing from that, you'll still need to add transcriptions to your tool kit. Otherwise you'll overlook subtle things like when he is playing a double stop, not a single note. If you are beginner, most of the song commentary is going to be over your head. If you understand some music theory and some guitar theory, then they will make sense and be helpful in analyzing what is going on in each section of each song. If they don't make sense, slow down and listen one sentence at a time, pause, think about it, and ask yourself if it makes sense. The comments go by pretty fast for a beginner...",1376092800,2,4903,4.646651270207852

The DVD is generous in terms of the number of songs it covers, which goes far beyond to song list from the US release of AYE? What would have put it to 5 stars for me is what is missing:

- Tab, or at least basic chord charts would have been extremely useful. Both of these could have been provided as e.g. pdf content on the disk.
- I would loved to have heard more insight from Andy on the material, and his choices of equipment and specific settings for each song. Nice Hendrix tribute Strat, Andy. Sounded great!
- A written transcript of the narrative, since it contained some good explanations on the musical underpinnings of the songs' construction

Still, for anybody trying to get their head around how all of that wonderful noise can possibly be produced by a single (talented) player, this is a great learning asset.",1339891200,,934,4.553571428571429
7937033,4,B00005B6K7,"I have the other ""official"" Jimi Hendrix Experience instructional DVD, the one based on electric lady land, with the same guy, Andy, doing the guitar.  On the lady land one, Andy walks you through everything, showing the fingering and providing a narrative on what's going on, often saying which string and fret to play on.  This DVD only shows you his hands; so if you are good at following someone's fingers, without any verbal clues, this is a great DVD.  I find parts of it to be dead easy, and parts seriously challenging.  But for pieces like Red House, this is as good as it gets.",1274140800,,587,4.509433962264151
