Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode. Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.

Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.

BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast. Very much worth seeing at least once...Grady Harp, September 12",1347321600,2,2269,4.6
