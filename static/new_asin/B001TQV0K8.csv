8342277,5,B001TQV0K8,I got the DVD along with the book and deck of cards.  Full of all kinds of information.  The DVD seems completely unscripted.  A nice chat with a friend who has a lot of information to share.  I feel like I know Linda now.  I am pretty familiar with most of the plants covered but still learned a lot.  And the recipes are great.,1355184000,2,329,4.0625
8342278,1,B001TQV0K8,"The audio is atrocious, can't understand a word she's saying.  It's a good thing they included a printed transcript.
Unfortunately, only slides of the plants are shown.  Would have been much better to have included live video.",1331164800,4,226,5.081081081081081
8342279,1,B001TQV0K8,"Three hours of an old lady talking!!!!! NOT what I wanted!! I wanted an INSTRUCTIONAL! video where a person shows you what part of a plant to eat, how to cook it, cooks it in front of you and recipes. I was totally disappointed when I got this video and watched it. can only say to other prospective buyers DONT waste a nickle on this as you are throwing your money away!!! On the other hand I bought another DVD entitled ""Edible Wild Plants III Special Ed"" by Jim Meuninck and Jim Duke on a scale of 1 - 10 this is an 8. They show you and cook alot of items on the video, as well as recipes and websites to go to for more info (video has mild humor in it as well). No thanks to the 5 star reviews from other as I had based my purchasing of this video on their comments. Feel like sending them the bill for this DVD to recoop my money!",1258156800,22,835,3.9467455621301775
8342280,5,B001TQV0K8,"this is one of the best plant guides I've seen in a long time. I enjoyed the video but really was not happy with Linda saying that if you want more info see the book- that you can buy for a little extra of purchase her flashcards- ($15 more for the cards- and I will be buying them soon.) her guide on plants was outstanding, and she has a lot of info in the video - so much I took notes, and watched it a few times. this is worth it's weight in gold for anyone that camps or hikes to know that 50% of green plants out there is food! nice. I would tell anyone that likes the out doors, camps, or hikes to buy this if they want to know what to eat on the trail. it was a good buy for the money.",1257638400,13,693,3.7534246575342465
8342281,5,B001TQV0K8,"Great informative DVD. A bit long (3 hours) and a little boring but keep in mind it is a course or class like DVD. P.S. Milkweed is not bitter and you do not have to boil it 3 times, don't get it confused with Dogbane like most people do, because Dogbane IS bitter.",1255219200,3,265,4.018867924528302
8342282,5,B001TQV0K8,"This is the best dvd I have ever seen on the subject.  It is entertaining, and very informative. It's like sitting in the living room with Linda and having a visit! Excellent!",1254700800,6,175,4.46875
