8439048,5,B004RFWZHA,"I came here to seek for the higher quality video of this concert as I watched it on You Tube and it was amazing...! But the video of You Tube was not wonderful and so, wanted to get a DVD. Sorry to hear that we don't have any. But Absolutely amazing and wonderful concert. Very artistic stage production delivered by David with mesmerizing visual performance, and interesting music collaboration such as Drum N' Bass with symbolic Jazz piano improvisation. Again, artistic, sophisticated and stylized.",1454716800,,501,4.976190476190476
8439049,5,B004RFWZHA,"Having been at this concert, all I can say is David Bowie is one of the most amazingly talented artist, musician, songwriter and performer! This concert was one of the best concerts of his that I had the pleasure to see and being there was beyond words! I've seen Bowie in concert over 35 times throughout his career and the man never ceased to amaze me!",1453248000,2,354,4.378787878787879
8439050,2,B004RFWZHA,"Same comments as above...I wish I would have read the reviews.  I understand this is dated, but the quality uploaded on you tube is much higher than this ""hard copy""... I'll watch it once and be done with it.",1452816000,,208,4.333333333333333
8439051,3,B004RFWZHA,"The music and the various guest stars are all great, but the video looks like it was ripped from someone's old VHS copy.",1433635200,4,120,4.260869565217392
8439052,1,B004RFWZHA,Very poor quality.  Grainy and smeary picture quality.  Looks like it was burned from bad YouTube video.  Feel like I was burned.,1344211200,6,129,4.7727272727272725
8439053,1,B004RFWZHA,"I loved watching this concert when I first saw it on TV in 1997

The visual dynamics musical performances were excellent

I was very disappointed when I brought the DVD the video quality is just viewable

I would be interested to hear if others have had the same problem

Thanks
