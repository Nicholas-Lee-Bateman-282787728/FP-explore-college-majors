8194011,4,B000Q1DXB6,"There are four cartoons on this tape; the best one is The Three Robbers.  It is a funny, charming story.  Ever since we bought it we have watched it several times and it just gets better every time we watch it.  The best part is that all of the sound effects are done by voice, no instruments, just a voice.  It's like watching someone put on a one-man puppet show, doing all his own voices and sounds.  The other three cartoons are unique as well; you won't find cartoons like these on TV.  It's like a treasure from the past; and I know we will enjoy this tape for years to come.",1287878400,2,581,4.142857142857143
