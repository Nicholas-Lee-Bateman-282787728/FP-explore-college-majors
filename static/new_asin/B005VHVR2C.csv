The protagonist's stay in Paris heightened normal emotional reactions to loneliness and a sense of disconnectedness. The movie is beautiful , full of surprises till the very last minute and rich with insights. Highly recommend!",1456617600,,345,5.290909090909091
8487473,1,B005VHVR2C,"This typical ""talk"" movie is one of his stereotypical movies, of which ending is almost like sabotage. This movie doesn't highlight the essence of the human life. It is just a simple self-fulfilling bragging. Director Hong, you are not philosopher or something. You r just a talk movie filmmaker.  Very cheap movie.",1393113600,,315,5.0576923076923075

""Night and Day"" (2008 release from South Korea; 144 min.) brings the story of a middle aged Korean guy who, as explained to us at the beginning of the movie, sort of flees Korea due to some pot-smoking violation, ending up in to Paris. There he takes residence in a Korean-managed hotel. He gets to know the Korean community living in Paris, and eventually gets to know two young Korean women who are roommates. As the movie develops, we learn that he has a wife back in Korea, but he slowly but surely develops a crush on one of the young Korean women roommates. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself to see how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: at almost 2 1/2 hrs., the movie takes its time to develop, and the beauty on top of it is that in many scenes, the dirctor simply sets up the camera and lets the character talk (typical scene: couple of the main characters are enjoying a coffee outside on a terrace and discuss things). Yes, ""talk"" is the word of this movie. Funny thing is that virtually all of the movie plays out in Paris, and of course we associate ""talk"" movies with French movies. But this is very much a Korean movie, although the movie is also a very nice postcard from Paris, with lots of great shots of the city scenery and its neighborhoods. I was frankly surprised how quickly the movie rolled by, given its long length. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a foreign quality movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""Night and Day"" is definitely worth checking out.",1358812800,2,1741,4.386996904024768
