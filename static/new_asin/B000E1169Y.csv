8453048,3,B000E1169Y,"Three gorgeous actors in a beautifully shot but weak-on-plot Hong Kong melodrama.

Andy Lau's wife dies and her heart is donated to a woman whose cheating husband just happens to look exactly like Andy Lau (seriously) and whose body eventually rejects the heart. We're supposed to get all weepy and philosophical wondering if it's the heart that one loves or the body, a worthy ponder. But in point of fact the filmmaker just wants to give Andy an excuse for having two women to play with because he's such a big star and needs two leading ladies to make the math work. He's awesome, differentiating his two characters by varying the amount of peach-fuzz around his mouth. The time-hopping plot and doppleganger aspect make it a little hard to follow. No tears, but very pretty.

NOTE: I guess there is no way of knowing if this is a Dual Audio release. Make sure you can return it if it's a mainland, Mandarin Audio dub and not original Cantonese.",1357084800,,948,4.636904761904762
