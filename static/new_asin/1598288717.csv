I love the book very much, and this production is very close to what I've imagined about Forsytes. Amazing cast, amazing details through the years telling about the family. My favorite actor and actress who play Soames and Irene. When I'm watching the movie, I'm leaving their lives as a part of the time and family - great experience. No computer effects, no action as in an action movie. Enjoy the cast play and the plot, which is often missing in fancy, computer made movies....",1352419200,3,588,4.453703703703703
4441749,5,1598288717,"The Forsyte Saga has great writing and acting, as well as beautiful costumes and sets.

What I find as intriguing is the evolution of the roles and rights of women throughout the decades. Issues approached include sexual autonomy and reproductive rights among others, are topics that have been yet to be resolved in today's society.",1351555200,2,332,5.036363636363636
4441750,5,1598288717,"When Jane Austen and the world of technology came together in the 20th century it was exciting. Why? Because with the invention of movies, television and then, DVD's, a true reader could actually watch a perfect piece of literature come to life on the screen. Whether or not you like the book or the movie better is neither here nor there, what matters is that the characters enter your household and leave a lasting imprint on your imagination. THIS is The Forsyte Saga. THIS is yet another amazing gift for readers to watch and learn all about the pride, wealth and ups-and-downs of societal Britain during some of the most turbulent times in history.

The story truly wraps around the character of Soames Forsyte. This is a man who represents the higher echelon of society and loves the 1800's London world. He's a man of property who sees his future in the form of the lovely Irene - who he begins to pursue like a hungry lion chasing after a doe with only marriage in mind. Irene is not really fond of Soames, but when her stepmother tells her they will soon be destitute, Irene approaches Soames and accepts his proposal.

Now the Forsyte clan is beyond wealthy, and Soames is the manager of all that wealth who demands that the family be respectable. Soon they are celebrating the engagement of June Forsyte, daughter of Jolyon; Jolyon was cast out of the family for leaving his wife and running away with the governess (a major slip-up, which made Soames put him on the `out' list). June's fianc is a young architect named, Philip Bosinney. When June introduces Philip to her relatives, she singles out Irene, whom she has become very friendly with. What she doesn't realize is that Irene is looking for love - real love. Soames treats Irene as yet another piece of property instead of a soulmate (even though he is completely in love and obsessed with her). So the ALWAYS unhappy Irene decides to begin a love affair with June's prospective groom and, to make matters even worse, the independent outcast, Jolyon, comes back into the picture.

These situations get everyone into a mess as Soames' ownership of Irene spawns a horrific moment that results in Irene running away and separating from Soames for the next ten years. Soames wants a child and truly wanted that child from Irene, so he tries to get her back into his life. What happens? He drives her into the arms of another family member.

What goes around comes around, so to speak, and Irene bears a son while Soames sires a daughter. And this son and daughter end up falling for one another, yet their parents won't allow them to be together because of the awful secret that the family holds. The daughter's name is Fleur, and she is JUST like her father. A Daddy's girl through and through, she will not be told that she can't have the man she wants and throws herself into the love affair body and soul.

This story runs from the Victorian era straight into the beginning of the 1920's. The changes in the world make Soames shudder at times. From women's rights to allowing them to ride horses in the Park to motorcars that fill the skies with black smoke - these are issues that Soames despises. He wants to bring back the good old days when respect and wealth went hand-in-hand. Not to mention keep his beloved daughter far away from Irene's son.

This is the beginning of Galsworthy's saga about the Forsyte family. This first trilogy opened the door for him to write two more, which showed how the later generations dealt with the wars, financial problems, lost loves and changes in the world. This is a classic story; extremely well written and amazingly well acted. You'll get emotionally involved with the characters -hating them one minute and loving them the next. Galsworthy's words put the modern love stories to shame proving, once again, that we need more of these tales and far less of the `fanged and furry' ones. This is a definite keeper that will be watched over and over again. Hopefully the next two trilogies will be filmed very soon because the books were truly phenomenal!",1343433600,11,4068,4.658774373259053
4441751,5,1598288717,"I have to admit i got addicted and find this series gorgeous - actors superb-costumes and setting sumptuous but i still cannot for the life of me find credible the interaction of Irene and Soames. She despises him for what seems to be no reason...and carries it forward as if he were an ogre of huge proportions which seems overblown--he is merely a controlling and uptight dude. And he has every right to be angry and frustrated with her, after all, SHE is the one who cheated, not him....so my sympathy is actually more to Soames than Irene altho it is obvious that it is written to garner the feelings for her character....but anyway, it is enjoyable and well done despite my criticism and i give it 5.",1341878400,21,705,4.515625
4441752,5,1598288717,"30 years of Forsyte Victorian lust, drama, scandal, romance, flamboyance, indulgence, and lovely period perfection. I've owned the series on DVD for a decade. It's been watched repeatedly. Now sets are combined for this release. Stars of this series have grown to be mega stars in other series. It caused me to buy the John Galsworthy novels. The adaptation isn't perfect; no miniseries is, even though this attempt allows much, being over 700 minutes (near 12 hours).

Series 1 had 6 episodes, series 2 had 4. All have CC for the hearing impaired.
Two 1870s Forsyte men are conflicting opposite cousins who enjoy the upper middle class living as much as the next. Soames (Damian Lewis) is the abandoning wife, artist, loose, cruel man. Jolyon (Rupert Graves -Garrow's Law) is the posh lawyer, proper, and lover of Irene (Gina McKee -Borgias, Notting Hill) who does a stellar role. Soames daughter Fleur (Emma Griffiths Malin) is a big part of his life and the story in both series 1&2. Amanda Root and Alistair Petrie (Cranford) also appear in all 10 episodes. Offspring take the lead in the second series which takes viewers to the Roaring 20s, based on the book, ""To Let.""

This series is done in theatre style (my terminology) where scenes roll longer, not flashing away in seconds. That allows drama to unfold through excellent acting and dialogue, not special camera effects. To me, that's the only way to shoot a saga, a telling of lives over decades. One must get to know characters. There was a larger, longer, Forsyte book adaptation series with more episodes, covering more of the books. It was the 1960s, B&W only. Some may try to compare, as they will try to compare this miniseries with the books, but it's best to just sit back and enjoy this as an innovative, colorful, very compelling, UK period drama of a era gone by, but created for us on film in such a beautiful manner. The locations are, well...WOW. Costumes authentic. It's a step back in time, a thirty-year time travel of sorts.

Expect moving emotion. It's a lot of viewing, but you will find it hard to pause between episodes. A keeper for the Brit Period Drama shelf of the home library. Although it takes novel liberty, I believe Mr. Galsworthy would find this TV series worthy.",1340064000,13,2258,4.755102040816326

When I see him anyplace else, I think that I am watching Soames again, and not Damian Lewis.  It is a long series, but you must stick with it even during the uncomfortable parts.  The acting, the story arc, the scenery and the settings are unforgettable and beautiful in so many ways.  I cannot believe the talent in both the actors and the producers.  It had to be a monumental effort, and its long-lasting excellence will live for many years to come.",1472428800,,627,4.408695652173913

4441787,5,1598288717,"Maybe it's because I haven't seen the much lauded older production but I actually found this series quite charming and I liked the leads, all of them. The only really bad performance I saw in the entire thing was the portrayal of the governess and even she got slightly better as the years went on. Her first few scenes I found her pretty much unbearable, but not so much later as a wife with children. I wasn't expecting a raven haired Irene. I expected a blond given the book. To date the only other Irene I have seen is the incandescent Greer Garson in That Forsyte Woman and well, when it comes to herself, her looks, and her performances I try not to judge others based on that because she's a really hard act to follow in anything. She's just in a class of her own. I thought most of the actors involved really brought out the nuances of the characters and I was very pleased by the production as a whole. The costumer in particular I think is to be lauded as the work that was done there was simply stunning. I have never envied a character her clothes quite so much as I envied Irene's. I do think the actor is rather beautiful but it's the outfits that made me see her as the great beauty. She was clothed very well indeed. I finally bought this for my DVD collection. Something I rarely do these days. To me it was definitely worth having...",1432252800,,1351,4.301960784313725

People I hated for stabbing their friend in the back with their fianc, to later like the person. Truly rich and powerful men who could buy anything except genuine affection from their wives. The ending was abrupt and to me was disappointing. The truth is though this is unfortunately the way of many marriages of the time and how many men would fill their time. The woman were helpless and without voice and would forgive their husbands indiscretions. So truly a very authentic story for the period. The movie span into the 20's so you saw the characters gradually age and carriages replaced by cars. I gave it a lower rating because I wanted a better ending and wanted better for some of the characters it was no reflection on the quality but rather my desire for a happier HEA.",1413849600,3,953,4.578947368421052

4441814,4,1598288717,"If you love English period romances such as Downton Abbey, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, etc., you'll probably enjoy this. Having read all the books last winter, I found Series 1's six episodes to be very fairly true to the original story. Season 2 seemed rushed (only four episodes), omitting a lot with the third generation of Forsytes. And as other reviewers have written, the characters hardly age through the decades which becomes disconcerting. As for the DVD version itself, the big plus was that it was in wide-screen which I appreciated. The big negative for me is that there are no subtitles for Season 1. All in all, I liked it for what it is and can recommend it.",1403481600,2,677,4.65
4441815,5,1598288717,"I really liked this saga; even the bad guy had a humane side.  As this story is about following your heart, it is probably not for the strict Christian.

4441817,5,1598288717,"Sumptuous, romantic, compelling.  The list of adjectives that could be compiled to describe this brilliant adaptation of the Forsyte novels of John Galsworthy would be lengthy indeed.  If your cup of tea is period drama, this high-class soap opera will quench your thirst.

The long shadow of the 1967 version of Galsworthys magnum opus has finally been matched (if not eclipsed) with this lovingly-produced series that presents multiple generations of the Forsyte family, a family of considerable means and flaws in late 19th-Century and early 20th-Century England.

A bit of history is needed to fully appreciate the achievement of this production.  In 1967, when Galsworthys novels were first serialized, THE FORSYTE SAGA became such a smash hit first in the U.K. and then in North America, that peoples social lives were impacted.  It was even the first BBC serial to be sold to the Soviet Union.  During its second broadcast in the U.K. on Sunday evenings extending into 1969, the final episode attracted some 18 million viewers.  While not in the same league as the Davy Crockett craze of the mid-1950s (when every boy in America had a coon-skin cap), one must remember that the saga of the Forsytes is a period drama, not an historical adventure.  Programs like this aren't expected to be this popular.  Yet that is precisely what it became.  Though wrongly attributed to be the first BBC soap opera, it was nonetheless the first mega-hit soap.  All this to say that it was inevitable that such a legendary production, drawn from such rich source material, should be made again, especially in light of the one flaw in the original versionthe fact that it was one of the last major BBC productions to be shot in black and white video.

It isn't always possible to say this, but here it is wholly applicable: Thank Heaven for re-makes!

At the centre of this panoramic family history is the conflicted, fascinating character of Soames Forsyte, played to perfection by Damian Lewis.  Considering Lewis was preceded by the great Eric Porter in the 67 version (and Errol Flynn in a 1949 film adaptation!) this is high praise indeed.  Rupert Everett also stars as cousin Jolyon Forsyte, the black sheep of the family whose estrangement from the respectable Forsytes provides the basic foundation of the series.  Of the plethora of outstanding performances Corin Redgrave particularly, as Old Jolyon, is simply wonderful.  He shouldve won an award for his subtle, layered performance.  The only sour note in the acting department is the over-the-top caricaturing by Michael Maloney, who cant seem to play any role straight and always seems to be winking at the audience with an aren't I clever look about him.  This is a minor aberration in a splendid company of artists.

Production values are very high and there is rarely a false note, though the occasional use of distorted, almost fish-eye close-ups in the first series was a bit off-putting.  Such shots seemed modern and out of keeping with the look and feel of a period drama which has otherwise been so effectively realized.

Series 1 of THE FORSYTE SAGA is six 70-minute episodes.  Series 2 is four episodes.  Youll want to immerse yourself as the series charm works its magic.  It is well worth the investment of your time.

One final thought: if the final shot of Damian Lewis as Soames Forsyte doesnt move you, you are made of stone.  Lewis doesnt say a word, but his silent statement speaks volumes.",1397433600,,3463,4.903780068728523

The acting was amazing and the score was beautiful(not available in America iTunes:(. I was blown away by all of the performances, but was most impressed by the performance of Damian Lewis(Soames Forsyte). These characters were real people with a lot of depth and growth throughout the story. None of them were heroes and many of them surprise you in the end.

I say that because as good as the original was, and with more story, this remake stood on its own with a particularly powerful performance from the female lead.

Irene is not a brunette, and the actress who portrays her here simply does not have the eternal beauty that forms so much description (fully realized visually in the first version) from the novels.  It is hard to see what the attraction is to her here.  The story has been changed, as has the ending.  But why?  Is Galsworthy not good enough?  What remains (or, rather, what is) is a relatively mundane soap opera - not bad, but who cares. Definitely, absolutely get the first version.

4441858,4,1598288717,"The main theme in the saga is infidelity, which was a big deal in 19th century England, but for some reason the cheaters are favored by the author and portrayed as saintly heroes acting in pursuit of true love, and the wronged spouses especially Soames are portrayed as uptight or outright villains. It is especially annoying that the character of Irene, who obviously married Soames for his money, then treated him with disgust their whole marriage and ran off with another man, is treated by everyone as the most moral and desirable woman in the family.

The scenes are filmed in beautiful locations with 19th century and early 20th century gorgeous costumes, furnishings and lots of horse drawn carriages and so are delightful to watch. However, one strange element is that even though the saga stretches over more than 50 years, the adult actors never change their appearance at all; they look exactly the same in their 20's as they do in their 70's. Their children are born and grow into adults and the result is that the actors playing the adult children look almost the same age as their old parents.  There could have been at least an attempt at making the old characters have grey hair or some other signs of age, but alas, nothing was done at all.",1356739200,25,1257,4.683257918552036

8437309,3,1598288717,"To understand this piece of art the way the author of the novel, John Galsworthy, intended, one has to read the book. The movie series, especially the choice of the actress who played Irene, significantly distorted the content and repositioned Galsworthy's  emphasis. You need to know, and the movie series omits this information, that Irene was about 16 years old and, being restrained for years inside her home, had no idea about the sexual obligations of a wife to her husband, when she was pushed into this marriage by her step-mother. Yes, Soames, 37 or so at the time, loved her dearly, but he never understood her as a person and treated her as his property. This, very characteristic, view of women in 19th century England, created his personal tragedy, and her personal tragedy, too. And this issue was exactly what John Galsworthy was writing about, the main topic of his novel. This view encouraged Soames to rape Irene, and, consequently, her to leave him. Since then, she was afraid of him and disgusted by him. When I read the book, back in my teen years, my heart went to both of them. Unlike the author, who, apparently, hated Soames and most of his relatives, I pitied him, because, apart from his misunderstanding of the situation, he was a decent person and deserved better. According to John Galsworthy, though, he was an exemplary representative of his class, which Galsworthy had a very low opinion of, denying them certain human feelings. There was another series, made in 60's, with much better choice of actors for the main characters, and doing much better job on showing the characters' aging over time, that reflected the book and the author's view entirely. This currently discussed movie series did a good job on costumes and scenery but a poor job on the casting and aging of the main characters. I personally highly dislike their choice of the actress for Irene. Irene should be young, beautiful, shy and nave. Not cunning and assertive, as she is in this series. As for Fleur's mother looking as if she was her sister, according to the book, that was shown exactly right.",1487376000,,2104,4.796143250688705
