5743033,4,B00CVVH2IY,Great basic police procedural.  Very happy,1425859200,,42,6.0
5743034,2,B00CVVH2IY,"The plots are serviceable, but the dialogue is written and sounds like the exchanges from the old American series Dragnet and Adam-12. I kept watching because Jean Reno is a reason to give anything a chance, but in this series the heft he can bring to a role is never utilized. The complexity the writers try to give the characters feels made up and flat as if they selected problems from columns A or B and C. Also, why now does just about everyone in Paris sound like an American?  Placing the stories in Paris is also a wasted effort. The locale plays no part in authenticating or localizing the stories. I was so excited about the possibilities for this series, but it does not fulfill its potential.",1425340800,2,704,4.5
5743035,5,B00CVVH2IY,"I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, which I viewed on ACORNTV (a subscription I pay for because they stream Region 2 films not available on Amazon) and I would gladly purchase it and any other seasons. Although the accents were missing, it was a pleasure to be able to watch without the subtitles.
The accent often makes it hard to understand what is being said or the actors generally speak too low to be heard, so this was a pleasant surprise to me. While the critics basically dismissed it as barely viewable, I feel that they missed the entire point being a loyal L/O fan, I appreciated Jo in a way that exceeds my fondness for L/O. The relationships were more interesting, especially Jo's backstory. Underneath that gruff exterior is a deeply wounded man/child. I enjoyed his interactions with his partners and especially the one forming with his daughter, partner and boyfriend. His boss, not so much-lol. I think fans of John Luther will find a kindred soul in Jo St. Clair it  is as rich with French history and culture as Inspector Lewis.
The last episode was far more the cleverest finale then I have seen in a long time. My only complaint is that I do not see any mention that there is a season 2, 3 or 4. I highly recommend this series.",1425340800,5,1243,4.524444444444445

5743037,4,B00CVVH2IY,"NOTE: SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD

Critics cited on various other websites seem to have dismissed ""Jo"" as a collection of cop-show clich&eacute;s. I don't think it's quite that simple. Certainly creator/writer/producer Rene Balcer, writer and showrunner of the original ""Law & Order"" and other parts of the L&O universe, and his team made use of some familiar (and useful, and largely successful) building blocks from L&O days. I might arguably describe that as lazy writing, but not, on that basis alone, as bad writing.

I'm an L&O fan, but I was attracted to this by the fact that my favorite actress, the magnificent Orla Brady, plays the Anita Van Buren/Don Cragen role as ""Commissaire B&eacute;atrice Dormont."" My first thought was that this would be ""Law & Order: Rive Gauche."" It wasn't quite that, although the familiar elements mentioned above range from the wisecrack at the fade into the opening credits, to the detective estranged from his adult daughter in part because of his own demons and addictions, to the Ell-Tee with lessons hard-won from years of sobriety. There were probably many more. Episode Six nods at the L&O universe with a guest appearance from Sam Waterston (not playing Jack McCoy). I imagine nearly everyone who knows L&O was hoping, as I was, they could contrive to get his character and series regular Jill Hennessy's into a scene together. Episode Eight, which turned out to be the final one of the series, places the show entirely within the L&O universe with the appearance of a well-known recurring character from one of the spinoffs.

I didn't have a problem with the plots, but I did find the dialogue surprisingly wooden sometimes. Tom Austen's lines in the earlier eps, especially, often seemed very awkward (again, this isn't about his performance, but about the writing). Some critics evidently said the show didn't do enough to highlight the Paris scenery. I thought, on the other hand, it did a good job of demythologizing the City of Light and making it a city of actual people.

For me as for some others, the big question mark was someone's decision to have all of these allegedly French people (with the exception of Jean Reno, who really is French) speak in terrible, flat American accents. Having to listen to Orla Brady swallow her natural Irish accent in order to deliver lines like ""Well, you need to get up there and show `em how it's done"" or ""This two-bit drug dealer..."" while sounding like she was from Akron or something was one of the true crimes in each episode. On the other hand, Jo had a memorable bit in Episode Five: ""He was looking at her the way a man looks at a woman. He's the warden. He should be looking at her the way a grocer looks at oranges."" Even Lenny Briscoe couldn't have gotten away with a line like that.

Be sure to note the wonderfully atmospheric score by Danish jazz artist and composer Thomas Hass Christensen. Reminiscent of Miles Davis' minimalist score for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elevator-to-the-Gallows-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000E5LEVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elevator to the Gallows (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;(""Ascenseur pour l'&eacute;chafaud""), it really helps set the mood for the series.

On the whole, I liked ""Jo"" and thought future series, had there been any, could have had a lot of promise. This is a weird little satellite orbiting on the outer edges of the L&O universe, but it was not in the least an unpleasant place to visit. Even though only eight episodes were made, it's good to know we'll always have Paris.",1411516800,,3586,5.079796264855688
5743038,5,B00CVVH2IY,"The package was shipped and delivered fast. Always upon opening new purchased CDs or DVDs, I am always checking first the status of the disc(s) on written data side; the first DVD of this package was showing multiple scratches on written data side, easy visible - I am wondering how could this happen if product was listed ""new"", from manufacture (big purchase concern !!!). The disc was playing with no issues, so I conclude that I am satisfied with purchase. Jean Reno is one of my best actors considered.",1405728000,,507,4.707865168539326

8586849,4,B00CVVH2IY,Fortunate to have tech savvy family member who transferred this PAL format to digital so I can watch on my computer.  Jean Reno is just terrific in this police procedural.  Hope we'll get a shot at Season 2.,1492387200,,207,4.421052631578948
8586850,5,B00CVVH2IY,"Watched the series on Acorn.  Love Jean Reno.  However despite Jean Reno, I had to keep reminding myself this was set in Paris not some English speaking country because of the majority of the actors were very much not French.  However I love Jean Reno and thought this was a fun series.  Wish it had gone a second season because there were so many dangling threads.",1484697600,,365,4.484848484848484
8586851,5,B00CVVH2IY,"I do not own the discs.  I streamed it on Amazon Prime where you have no obvious way to rate.  This is a creation of Law and Order alum Rene Balcer, who used his French roots to create a thoroughly hybrid American/French series of thrillers starring the gritty, brilliant French actor Jean Reno. Just the idea of bringing the American police procedural to France is gutsy. The seamless interplay of cultures is riveting. The stories are edge of the seat.  Keep looking for season 2. Where is it?  And, of course, all the best to Reno and Balcer.",1474502400,,545,4.530612244897959
8586852,2,B00CVVH2IY,"I purchased this because I'm a fan of Jean Reno and because I also enjoy European police procedurals.  My particular favorites are Spiral and Braquo -- both first-rate, compelling series.  My hope was that Jo would be of a similar quality and intensity but it simply isn't, in my opinion.  Other reviewers have mentioned the jarring quality of the accents.  I agree; I found it very difficult to get past this problem. For reasons that I don't understand, we have one (and only one) French star, speaking heavily-accented English in a set-in-Paris drama, about the French police and peopled with a cast of characters who are supposed to be French and --- other than Reno -- are American and British.  Why? It's bizarre. And I found that the confluence of differing accents undermined the whole premise. It felt like I was watching Law and Order with the cast on a field trip to Paris. That's problem #1.  Problem #2 for me is the stilted quality of the dialog -- in whatever accent.  I don't quite know how to explain it -- but there's a contrived, almost ""confidential"" quality to many of the characters' delivery that reminds me of the individual character vignettes in the British version of The Office.  That type of delivery worked like a charm in The Office, but this is no satire and it just felt improbable and annoying.. Problem #3 is that, once again, the tired old cliche is trotted out of an older, broken down cop with a dysfunctional personal life and his own set of addiction demons. It would take a rare actor and a very good script to overcome the cliche and inject it with a fresh take. Much as I like Reno as an actor and much as I thought he did a creditable job in personifying Jo, I felt that he was weighed down by the script.  The result is that I just didn't get pulled into the lead character's struggle or the general storyline.  Other reviewers have had a different take and I respect that, but for me, this series was a disappointment.",1472947200,,1964,4.538243626062323
8586853,5,B00CVVH2IY,"wonderful. Cast Jean Reno in something and I will watch it. This is a wonderful series which I can highly recommend, The location shooting is a help I must admit, I am wishing for a Season 2,3,or more. I have a region free player and it affords me the pleasure of enjoying shows like this. I recommend any cinephile to buy one.  As a policeman , Reno is well cast. He has a wonderful face and is a pleasure to watch. Seek out ""Crimson Rivers"" and ""22 Bullets""...available on Amazon.",1468972800,,482,4.355555555555555
