8582954,5,B00CL3SVR8,"There were 5 seasons and a total of 50 episodes.  It's a small investment but worthwhile.  I lived in Japan for many years and have a large collection of Asian movies.  I would consider this production to be one of the best that I have seen.  It is a long series but it kept me captivated and interested.  It is not a typical samurai movie; there is very little sword fighting scenes and special effects are minimal.  However there is a lot of historical value, particularly the role of the women during the Shogun period.  The role was much more powerful than I had known.  The story is about sacrifice and loyalty.  A trip to Japan would be much more interesting if you have the chance to view this film beforehand.  The beginning of Season 1 was a little confusing since I did not understand the role of each party.  But the movie does a good job of explaining certain events that may be confusing.  The subtitles were clear and appeared to be accurate.  Highly recommended.",1419897600,,977,4.482954545454546

If you want to know about the Shoganite of Japan, this is historically accurate.  Moving tale that will bring tears of joy and sorrow to your heart!",1391472000,,319,5.215686274509804
