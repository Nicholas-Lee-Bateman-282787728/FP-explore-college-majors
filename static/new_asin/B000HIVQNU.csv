2638043,5,B000HIVQNU,This documentation is a real compliment to the intelligence of our grand Creator.  What a variety of plant and wildlife that we are so unaware of.  The photography is very well done -- is so relaxing and refreshing to view this area.  I love it.,1377216000,,245,4.4
2638044,3,B000HIVQNU,"I should have checked the length before purchasing,although I will add it to my tape library. I am collecting vhs tapes about the coral reef and the fish and other creatures that live there.",1347840000,,190,4.617647058823529

""Dive into a world teaming with extraordinary life where males are females and even the rocks are alive.  Danger lurks at every turn and only the lucky survive.  A unique journey to a mysterious world of strange and beautiful creatures.""

This is how this mesmerizing documentary begins whose subject is the Great Barrier Reef located off the coast of Australia.  The viewer gets to experience a day in the life of the world's largest coral reef where the only law is ""eat or be eaten.""

And what a day it is!  You'll get to see a dizzying array of creatures that make the reef their home.  You'll also get to see a kaleidoscope of brilliant colors as each of these creatures are adorned with colors that make them a sight to behold.

Here are the names of some of the creatures on the reef: lion fish, puffer fish, damsel fish, clown fish, Christmas tree worms, parrot fish, garden eels, Spanish dancers, sea cucumbers, and nudibranches.

Narration is provided by actor Stacy Keach.

The title of each scene is as follows:

(1) Introduction

(2) A mysterious underwater realm

(3) Tidal currents

(4) Schools of predators

(5) The nighttime reef (that is VERY different from the daytime reef)

My only recommendation is to make sure that your television or viewing device is adjusted for optimal color.  (If you have a big screen TV, I envy you.)

Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are no extras.

In conclusion, for those who want to experience a ""community like no other in the world,"" this is the film to see!!

(1995;  55 min;  full screen;  5 scenes;  made for TV (PBS);  closed captioned)

8139863,3,B000HIVQNU,"I dunno, I was hoping for more than was presented. I'm always in awe when I see life underwater. But I think this sorta reminded me of some kind of circa 1980's show. The video quality isn't indicative of a NOVA show so I was kinda thrown for a loop. It's a one time watch and you're done.",1481414400,,289,4.0

8139865,5,B000HIVQNU,"Well worth having for the beautiful photography of the reef. Very little shown of ""bleached"" reef areas.  Full of life and luminous ocean creatures. A very good sequence on Sea Turtles for those who like them.",1457308800,,209,4.805555555555555
