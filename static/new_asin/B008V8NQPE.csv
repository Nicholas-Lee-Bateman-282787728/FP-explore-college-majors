5184332,3,B008V8NQPE,"Yeah the customer reviews are 'so right on' about the lousy packaging. True it's a reasonably priced set, but we would pay a couple of dollars more for decent packaging. Some of us are collectors you know. I liked the Frank Sinatra set put out by the same company as the Robert Mitchum set and it's packaged the same way. Some of these films in these sets are lengendary classics and should be packaged better than this, but what do I know - right !",1504051200,,449,4.294117647058823
5184333,5,B008V8NQPE,"9 super Robert Mitchum movies...What a Way to Go! is really all about Shirley MacClaine and I really didn't care for it, although Robert Mitchum did his best.  Night of the Hunter still gives me chills.  And I remember watching The Enemy Below with my dad--Curt Jurgens also awesome.  Quality of the dvds is great and the sound, too.  Paid less than $25 for the set.  What a bargain!",1502668800,,383,4.492753623188406

HEAVEN KNOWS Mr ALLISON--  A MARINE CORPORAL  (MITCHHUM)  GETS STRANDED IN A SOUTH SEAS ISLAND WITH A NUN (KERR) DURING WWII.
THE ENEMY BELOW:  A WWII CAT AND MOUSE STORY ABOUT A U-BOAT CAPTAIN (CURT JURGANS) AND A US DESTROYER CAPTAIN (ROBERT MITCHUM).  A NICE MOVIE...
THUNDER ROAD: THRILLER ABOUT A BOOTLEGGER...
I COULD GO ON AND ON. THEY ARE ALL GOOD.",1458432000,2,404,4.633802816901408
5184344,5,B008V8NQPE,I really liked this package.  I didn't buy it at first because of all the negative comments that were posted about its packaging.  Either Amazon listed and changed the packaging or it was exaggerated by people saying how the DVDs were not protected.  I personally found the packaging to be fine.  The DVDs are all unscratched and very enjoyable.  So if you like Robert Mitchum this is a great deal.  I paid more for one of these movies than I did for these six movies.,1455926400,14,468,4.447058823529412

5184349,4,B008V8NQPE,this box set was bought at a bargain price and this is due to the poor box design as stated by other reviews i have deducted 1 star for the box design but it would have got 5 stars + for the content of dvds which is excellent robert mitchum was a great actor. A suggestion for amazon about the packageing a bit of bubble wrap round the box set then put inside padded envalope would provide extra protection.,1438128000,5,407,4.1645569620253164
5184350,3,B008V8NQPE,"Packaging horrible, 2 disc were out of their cardboard sleeves. Other disc pack tightly in cardboard sleeves. Pulling them out causes scratches on all 10 disc. It's the worst packaging I have ever seen or bought. It's true what other reviewers are saying about this matter. The 10 movies are ok selection although Longest Day has 12 other star actors, Anzio should belong here not Longest Day. I can't believe they would use cardboard sleeves in a tri-fold cardboard case. I had to modify the whole dvd case using paper sleeves, I suggest don't buy or if you want these 10 movies, use paper sleeves.  This Mitchum movie set should be re-packaged another way other then this so unprofessional way it was packaged into two trifold cardboard cases that insert into another cardboard case. I also had very fine cardboard shavings on all the disc had to blow air onto the dvd disc & cases. Never seen such a shoddy way to pack 10 disc. Something should be done about this, it's truely bad.",1437955200,7,984,4.655172413793103

5184356,5,B008V8NQPE,"The Robert Mitchum Film Collection is a good cross-section of this versatile actor's repertoire. The only omission that stands out is The Sundowners.
Some big surprises, for me, were What a Way to Go, a strange black comedy with Shirley MacLaine, Paul Newman, Mitchum, Gene Kelly, Dean Martin, Dick Van Dyke et al. Edith Head was given $500,000 in 1963 to do the costumes and they are beyond belief. Shirley and Gene Kelly perform a dance number that stunned me.
Thunder Road is even better than I remembered, The Way West, with Kirk Douglas and Richard Widmark is a western I somehow never saw, and is surprisingly good.
Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison, with Mitchum as a shipwrecked Marine and Deborah Kerr as a nun, find themselves on a tropical isle in the pacific in WWII. Their simmering chemistry is something missing from today's films.
There isn't a bad film in the whole collection and the quality is very high in both picture and sound.
For the money, you cannot miss with this collection.
Thunder Road by itself is selling for over $90.",1422144000,20,1042,4.730769230769231

This included the Longest Day, The Way West, and this crazy movie starring Shirley McLaine (What A Way To Go) weren't that good.  Thunder Road, The Hunters, Night of the Hunter, Heaven Knows Mr. Allison, The Enemy Below, River of No Return, all really good.",1408924800,7,389,4.705882352941177
5184363,5,B008V8NQPE,Excellent collection at an affordable price. Robert Mitchum was a very good actor and could play many roles. He will go down in film history as one of the best along with John Wayne! Perfect for anyone's collection.,1406419200,,215,4.684210526315789
5184364,2,B008V8NQPE,"It's a great set of movies, not a bad one in the bunch.  But as a previous reviewer noted, the packaging is terrible.  All the disks have scratches; how could it be otherwise when they're not protected?  Even paper sleeves would have been better than this.  So, watch out.  You'll want to watch these movies, but whether they're in good enough condition for you to be able to enjoy them -- well, that's far from certain!",1404604800,49,420,4.473684210526316

MGM & 20th Century should have down a better quality control check on the inner liner photographs.  One of the photos used is not Robert Mitchum, but rather Rory Calhoun!",1388534400,20,331,4.576271186440678

5184370,5,B008V8NQPE,"Bob Mitchum turned out more interesting performances than anyone during the mid 1940's to the mid 1960's.
As a kid I ate up movie ""Thunder Road"" and I always a Dad like the one he portrayed in ""Home From The Hill""

5184371,1,B008V8NQPE,"you've got to be kidding me, Fox and MGM. ten discs snugly tucked into cardboard sleeves with each pull of the disc from its slot resulting in scuffing that just can't be helped. Every disc - yes, every disc in the packaging I received had semi-concentric scuff patterns on the playing side of the disc that makes it seem like these discs have been thru a billion Blockbuster rentals. to add insult to injury, 'The Hunters' is a two sides play disc (1 FS and 1 WS) so, both sides are scuffed terribly because of virtually no protection to the disc. Shame on you, Fox and MGM for dropping the ball on QC...in this era of mass manufacturing, this packaging is an insult to media. Please do not buy this on any count. Even if the discs are brand new, it takes just 3 or 4 pulling the disc and putting back into its slot, to render it chockful of scuffs and minor scratches.",1354924800,113,870,4.310975609756097
