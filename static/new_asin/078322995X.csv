From the opening scene to the end credits, my eyes remained on the screen with constant amazement.  The movie both tells the story as accurately as possiable, and in doing  so, it helps to add to the knowledge not yet known.  I reccomend this movie  to anyone who appreciates the bible and animation done at its best.",929491200,,440,4.518987341772152

54493,5,078322995X,"I purchased this as a gift for a dear friend, having done so for our family before this. It is a stand-out example of an animated feature with intense spiritual merit.
I make it a point to watch Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" whenever it comes on TV, having first seen it in a NYC theater when I was around 16. That literally gave me goosebumps, as I wished I were as close to God as Moses was.
So when I watched this cartoon version, I was stand-offish at first. Like, how is a cartoon version going to measure up to DeMille's?
""The Prince of Egypt"" is, in a large sense, another Hollywoodish take on Exodus. True. It fills in some questions, such as: How did Moses first get in touch with his sense of conscience concerning the slaves in Egypt? As did DeMille's.
But one scene hit me to the core: a small moment in the vast epic which DeMille did not portray, at least not with this clarity:
It is when Moses is on Sinai by God's calling. I watched open-mouthed as the cartoon version showed Jehovah's Holy Spirit surround and fill Moses, and Moses' subsequent elation. This scene, no Hollywood style story-telling could match.
Winning theme song, too.",1514505600,,1165,4.5

54507,5,078322995X,"Right up there with Lion King.
Yes, I said that.

The score is sweeping, epic, and intimate (Hans Zimmer, of course).
The imagery is gorgeous.
The special effects (which include a little CGI subtly incorporated) I would say withstand the test of time.
The story, though certainly not exact to the Biblical account, honors many themes and does not insert opposing beliefs. Unlike Ridley Scott's Exodus, this film sincerely reveres God as just, merciful, and good - clearly evidenced by the burning bush scene. This movie's take on Moses is indeed more playful and joking at first while you see him as a prince with enormous wealth and privilege, but once he understands the weight of slavery and God's call for him, everything becomes more serious and intimate. Perhaps it's Moses' character shift from flippancy to reverence and devotion to God that I most appreciate about this film.

The fact that this movie has yet to be converted to Blu-Ray as of 2017 is very disappointing, especially for how lovely the imagery and music this movie possesses.
I will be first in line to purchase it the day it comes out in Blu-Ray!",1507852800,,1121,4.803108808290156

54511,5,078322995X,Great adaption to the story of Moses. I like how this version and : Cecil B.

I have this on VHS myself, and watched it as a kid, and thus, I forgot a lot of it, except for the deliver us song, and I had a strong urge to relive the experience again, hence the online purchase. This movie is great. great songs, very moving. The acting and voices are great, and the god scene almost made me cry when I watched it as a kid. Now that I've seen it again, I can understand the burden Ramses had on his shoulders, and how stubborn he was. I never cared for religious texts, they are too boring, a waste of time, when you could be doing more important things instead of reading a really old book. However, at least I'm glad people know it, and it was made into a movie so I could feel it without reading it.",1500336000,,806,4.1075949367088604

54678,4,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt produced by DreamWorks is a modern day cartoon depiction of the whole book of Exodus in the Old Testament. It begins at the time of a child named Moses and his birth into the house of an Israelite, where all of the newborn sons were being taken and killed by Egyptian soldiers to quell the growing population of Israelites. His mother indirectly gives him away to the queen of Egypt, and there Moses spends his childhood growing alongside the real prince and destined Pharaoh of Egypt. When he comes of age he realizes his past, and leaves the palace to find himself again after he kills an Egyptian slave driver. Moses receives a message from God for him to save the slaves of Egypt and take them to the promised land. In the process, and through God, Moses casts 10 plagues to the people of Egypt, which result in the Pharaoh letting the slaves go, but soon chases them. Right before being caught, God saves Moses' people, and they are led away from slavery and into the freedom of the promised land.

 As stated earlier, the film is based on the book of Exodus, however, it only covers the first fourteen chapters when the Israelites happen to still be in Egypt. A theme of the movie creates a fact that Moses and Ramses, the future pharaoh seem to be super closely bonded brothers doing everything together. However, the bible totally neglects this fact, which leaves a massive plot hole in the movie, as Ramses and Moses have a constant brotherly hatred-like relationship towards each other. In the bible, when Moses kills the Egyptian soldier in verse 2:12, the pharaoh reacts very badly, calling for the soldiers to seize and kill Moses. But in the movie, Moses is called back for reconciliation with open arms. His 'brother,' and 'father' call for him to return and forget what he has done. Moses's wife, Zipporah is also a key factor in the movie, showing Moses the side of him that is different from the Egyptians, when she is offered to him as a sex slave, but he lets her run away. In the actual bible, there is no mention of her until verse 2:23 when Jethro gave him her hand in marriage. However, we finally reach a point of strict relation, where Moses meets the burning bush in the mountain, both in the movie as well as in the bible. In the bible verse 7:6, Moses is said to be 88 years old, and while this doesn't really matter, in the movie he appearance makes him look like he is in his mid twenties, signifying how much less time he spent in the living in the desert.

 Another similarity lies in the first moment when the Pharaoh and Moses see each other again. The bible verse 7 states that Moses went with Aaron to request the release of the slaves, which is also depicted in the movie, when Moses goes with his sister, Aaron, and his wife. In verse 7:10-12, Moses's staff seems to overcome the staffs of the magicians of Egypt, while in the movie, the two malicious priests consistently show their superiority over Moses and make him look like a fool to the Pharaoh. Soon after, the ten plagues are cast upon Egypt, and the movie quickly skims over these, with one odd series of scenes showing fiery meteors falling from the sky, which could be the 7th plague that refers to 'hail.' The Passover story is explained as the Holy Spirit descends upon the Firstborns of Egypt and correlates well with the bible. Finally ending with the departure of the slaves from Egypt, the bible and the movie have a parallel recollection of the story, closing with the destruction of the Egyptian Army and the freedom of the Slaves.

However, as this movie is a Dreamworks Production, and a family based film, I can understand that sacrificing some minor details for good and interesting scenes that are unique to the film and not the bible story. I personally loved the movie because I felt like to offered a lot emotion compared to the bible story, which is very sharpened. The movie included a lot of soundtracks that really brought out the storyline to make something that you could easily connect to. The movie didn't only provide an appeal to the audience in the form of a storyline, but it also educated the audience in a childish yet exciting view.",1449446400,,4184,4.551128818061089

54789,5,078322995X,"As was mentioned in Wikipedia, this movie is an animated remake of ""The Ten Commandments"". The movie has songs and special effects, but it is not in any way cutesy-it tells the story of Moses in full harshness. We see the brutality of Egyptian society and of the gods, and the attitudes of the people of the era.

It is the story, as told in the Biblical Exodus, of how a baby was put in a basket in the river to escape harm, and was found by the royal rulers of Egypt. Moses would adopt the attitudes of his adopted family-until he is forced to learn of his relationship to the enslaved tribes of the Hebrews.

The movie is more morally ambiguous than most. There are no true heroes and villains, and Ramses, though technically the bad guy, is simply the natural product of his society, with the attitudes he was raised up on. Meant for the older children, rather than the tots who will find the subject matter harsh and frightening.",1434153600,,934,4.424418604651163

This is a striking adaptation of the biblical story of Moses from the book of Exodus, so watching this film might be most effective and rewarding if you're already familiar with the story.

The films animation is wonderful; it is an interesting interpretation that brings to life the ancient times in which the story takes place.

The actors who provide the voice talent all do a great job, and the music (by Hans Zimmer) and songs are great, they are tender and moving when they need to be, and very powerful at the many powerful moments that give this movie its unique appeal.

A side note: There are many great animated films, yet this movie is one of the biggest animated film favorites of my primary-school-age daughters.

54816,5,078322995X,"Before some of you jump all over me for calling the Exodus story a myth, here's the primary definition of the word from Merriam-Webster: A usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon.

The story of Moses is one that serves as major tentpole for three of the world's major religions. This is an excellent retelling of that story and the characters really come to life (despite being animated). One of my favorite aspects of the film is the portrayal of Moses' and Ramses' relationship. The first act does an excellent job showing that these two men grew up as brothers; that there is a seed of love between the two that follows them throughout the film, lasting until their final face-to-face confrontation prior to the tenth plague. The musical score by Academy Awarding winning composer Hans Zimmer, is fantastic. When you believe (the number from the film not the pop, radio-friendly version) is a particular favorite of mine.  The is really a story of two men's opposing convictions - Moses' believe that he is God's messenger to his people; Ramses that he has an implicit responsibility to uphold and extend the legacy of Pharaonic tradition . Two men trying to please their fathers...hm. Anyhoo...a great flick that's fun for the whole family.",1431993600,,1372,4.9094827586206895

54823,5,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest, yet one of the most under appreciated animated movies of all time. Its a movie that doesnt aged, but actually gets better the older the audience gets. So for just a moment I want to be condescending to the readers of this review by telling them that if they think animation is something only for kids... give up now. It will be impossible to say anything about this movie that will impress you. But nothing can convince me that The Prince of Egypt is anything less than amazing and is worth pursuing for the simple fact that there is no other movie like it in the world.

This movie is a retelling of the biblical story of Moses. For those of you not familiar with the story, Moses lived in a time when the entire Israelite nation was enslaved to Egypt. The God of Israel delivered Moses as a baby from the mass slaughter of Hebrew children by bringing him into the palace of the Pharaoh where he would be raised. The Lord intended to use Moses unique position to free the Hebrews from slavery and this movie follows quite closely the adventures, the mistakes, and the triumphs that are written about in the biblical text of Exodus.

The production behind The Prince of Egypt is interesting, as it was the first animated film released by DreamWorks. On a personal note, it offends me when people think Disney created this movie. Even during the early days of DreamWorks Animation this underdog studio surpassed every Disney standard. The idea for this movie was actually suggested by Steven Spielberg himself because this still-young studio wanted to tell a story that was sweeping and epic. Their ambition created a movie that even surpasses the impressiveness of The Ten Commandments, which is another movie from the 1950s about Moses story. Trying to describe all the reasons why is very difficult, because every single detail in this movie is a treasure thats become quite unremembered in the animation community.

The Prince of Egypt tells the story of Moses from a very personal and character-driven perspective. The conflict revolves around the friendship between Moses and his adopted brother, Ramesis. Many early moments in this movie take a certain artistic-liberty with the biblical story, but this movie develops some really complex characterization that really flesh out an otherwise pretty accurate retelling of Moses story. Moses and Ramesis are both princes of Egypt, yet they are friends rather than rivals. At an early age they have an undying devotion to each other, yet both of them would grow up with very different destinies.

Ramesis is encouraged from an early age to be the responsible one who is going to rule Egypt with an iron fist. But since the other brothers future isn't quite as great Moses is allowed to be carefree with his tasks, but he is still quite supportive of his brother. However, its after a terrible mistake and a terrible realization of his Hebrew origins that Moses decides to flee his home and then the two brothers are forced to live without each other for many, many years. Moses eventually realizes it was Gods plan all along for him to deliver the Hebrews from Egypt, and when the time comes for him to return he finds himself at odds with Ramesis. His former brother cant bring himself to free the Hebrews, as much as he might still love Moses. Gods plan, however, works flawlessly to overcome all of Ramesis stubbornness so Moses can fulfill the plan given to him by the Lord.

The elaborate setup behind this movie creates very believable and compelling motives for all the biblical characters. The intention, of course, is not to add to Gods holy word, but rather to use modern animation and storytelling to help this Bible story come to life on the big screen. It is actually surprising that DreamWorks -when they were a younger studio- would tell a story that involves God so heavily. Not only that, but God is taken completely seriously in this movie and reveals himself to Moses with all the love, compassion, sincerity and power that are rightly his.

The Prince of Egypt is a wholesomely remarkable movie that reminds people of faith about who God is and what power he can accomplish through his servants. This is not just for kids either, but also adults who probably need to understand how much God loves them and cares about them. Moses is also such a compelling hero; being developed in this movie as a humble man who did great things through the Lord. This is one of the things that was most greatly improved upon from the original Ten Commandments movie, which portrayed Moses as a great person who did great things through a God who was rather passionless.

Of course, I don't only applaud The Prince of Egypt for telling a beautiful Christian-inspired story, but also for its presentation. During their early years, DreamWorks was the king of animating humans. The design of each person is completely unique and each character is perfectly portrays as a realistic human in a world where things such as kingship and slavery are taken very seriously. The character designs don't lean towards photo-realism either but lean towards expressive designs that give the animators freedom to exaggerate each expression, but without being cartoony. The animation is so stellar you can actually read each characters thoughts just by looking into their eyes and watching their faces. Many genuinely astounding moments in this movie don't even tell the story with any voice acting or sound, but simply let the animation tell the story for you.

But that is just the beginning of this movies awesomeness. Paying attention to the backgrounds by themselves is quite an experience, as you can see how animation gives the creative team the power to make Egypt look larger-than-life. The plagues of Egypt rain down destruction in a way that only animation can tell. If you still believe animation is just kids, it might surprise you to discover how graphic and how horrifying some of these plagues are to the Egyptians who are really being afflicted with cruel agony. But there is also beauty, like in the movies climatic parting of the Red Sea which is just downright breath-taking in its sheer size and scope. And its not just the big things either but also the little things in this movie. Every frame of story telling in this movie is an artistic expression done with passion and devotion like Ive never seen before in any other animated movie.

But let us also talk about the music. The Prince of Egypt has a score unlike any other animated movie. There are beautiful instrumentals that compliment every single scene from the lighthearted and whimsical moments to the truly epic ones, and does it flawlessly. It might even scare some people away from this movie to learn that The Prince of Egypt is actually a musical. But in all honesty, the musical numbers only enhance the epicness and further tell a story that is really worth telling. And somehow at the bottom of my review you do find the work of the voice actors that is also worth noting. The all-star cast who lent their talents to this movie don't disappoint in providing the voices and expression necessary to bring this story to life. It is actually impossible to imagine each of the animated characters without the voice they were given, and if you boring adults can actually find yourselves entertained by this movie you might be surprised to realize that the voices and the animation were done separately. This is important because DreamWorks was once the king of animating humans and you could easily find yourself mistaking these hand drawn characters for live-action ones if you're not paying attention.

Seriously?

What could my honest opinion of this movie be if I think everything is so praise worthy?

Well, I am a believer in the Lord and in Jesus Christ. This is an animated movie I watch in order to be reminded of my faith because this is a story I believe to be true. And since I am also an animation buff, I also admit I am bias towards animation. But nothing I said about this movie is an exaggeration. The Prince of Egypt tells a true story with all the passion and respect it deserves; being consciously aware of course that some of this story is still made up. Regardless, youll understand the passion behind this movie when you reach the end of the credits and find actual Bible verses encouraging the real believers who are watching this. The Prince of Egypt is a milestone in animation unlike any other. It is a symbol of DreamWorks, back when they were a younger company who were far more ambitious, but their timelessly classic still shines with all its brilliance and majesty. I thank the Lord that we have a movie like this that isn't quite forgotten yet.",1430438400,2,8744,4.752964426877471

I was very excited when the Prince of Egypt was released in the theaters, I purchased the VHS tape within the first week of its release, my family watched it on Netflix several times a month, I now I have found the soundtrack CD and the movie DVD on Amazon!  So yes, I do love this retelling of the Exodus story.

If you pay attention the movie tells that it is a retelling, there is creative license at play here, they even state this within the first 10 seconds of run time. Dream works is not trying to be historically  or biblically correct. They are trying to stay true to essence of the story and even tell you were to look in the Bible to read the actual account of the Exodus if you want the true story.

There are many reviewers that were upset by the fact that story included the death of the Hebrew babies. Well, history is not always pretty and not every animated film is for toddlers.  I believe this is one of those films that is geared more for older children and adults.

I love the opening song, ""Deliver Us,"" and the beautiful singing of Ofra Haza as Moses' mother Jocebed.  It is heart-rending and haunting.  I love the relationship between Moses and Rameses, his Egyptian brother.  The Exodus song is amazing! I love the hearing the Hebrew in the singing!. Brian Stokes Mitchell's singing performance is stellar and exciting.  Most of the voice talent was awesome, although I would have liked to have seen more actors of African and Middle-Eastern decent given a chance for a change.  That having been said, I thought that Val Kilmer did a great job as Moses.  I found the performances of Ralph Fiennes, Helen Mirren, Jeff Goldblum, and Patrick Stewart especially thrilling and believable - in that order. However, I thought that Sandra Bulluck and Michelle Pfeiffer were completely miscast for these parts.  Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful, and I have loved her as an actor in other movies like White Oleander and Deep End of the Ocean.  But she was wrong for the part of Zipporah.  Her performance is flat. Sandra Bullock has always been one of my favorites. I loved her in so many pictures, such as Crash.  But her voice performance lacked warmth, passion and conviction in this movie.  It was almost juvenile. I was also unimpressed and puzzled by Danny Glover's accent.

According to the supplemental information provided by producers and creators of this film, a lot of time and research went into presenting this story with depth, honesty, and integrity.  However, Hollywood has once again reverted to type, and missed the mark.  A much better job could have been done at making the cast as colorful, warm, and authentic as the animated characters portrayed.",1420502400,,1872,4.932907348242812

55001,5,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt is an epic animated musical and  an adaptation of the Book of Exodus and follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt.

The film has taken the biblical story of Exodus, put it into cartoon form, and released it on the big screen as an epic animated feature. It tells the story of Moses releasing the Jews from Egyptian slavery under the hand of the evil pharaoh Rameses. The story revolves around these two close brothers, Moses and Rameses. While Rameses is groomed to take over the land, his beloved brother Moses is a carefree prankster, until he learns the true secret of his past. His secret, of course, is that he is really a Jew and as a child was floated down the river to escape mass genocide. The pharaoh Seti raised Moses as his son. Upon learning the truth of his past from a burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt with God on his side and demands that the pharaoh (now his brother Rameses) must ""Let my people go.""

The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable as well as more humanly knowable. The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent. Finally,it is an inspiring translation of biblical grandeur, turning the story of one of history's greatest heroes into an entertaining, visually dazzling animation.",1417910400,,1480,4.7734375

 The Prince of Egypt retells the classic story of Exodus, the journey of the Hebrews from enslavement under the Pharaoh to freedom as led by God's servant, Moses. The movie focuses heavily on the relationship between Moses and the Pharaoh, Ramses, who was Moses's adoptive brother. The film recounts Moses's flight from Egypt after killing a slave driver, and his return bearing a message from the Hebrew God: Let His people go. To convince the hardhearted Pharaoh to do so, a number of Plagues are visited upon Egypt, culminating with the death of all first-born, male Egyptian children, including the Pharaoh's own son. After parting the Red Sea to escape Pharaoh's wrath, Moses receives the Ten Commandments from God.
World Religion
 The story here is of one of the earliest difficulties overcome by the Hebrews, a people practically defined by their struggles against the rest of the world.
 One of the most dynamic elements of the story is the nature of the plagues that are visited upon Egypt. These are more than mere random acts of destruction simply to prove the very existence of the Jewish Yahweh. The Egyptian religion was polytheistic, so to acknowledge the existence of one more god was not so much of a stretch for them. What was at stake was proving that the Hebrew god was more powerful then the gods of Egypt to Pharaoh, who was believed to be a god in his own right. Turning the river to blood proved power over Isis, goddess of the Nile, darkening the sky proved power over the sun god Ra. But the most crushing blow was the so called Plague of the Firstborns which proved that the God that Moses served had power even over Osiris, the first Pharaoh and the Egyptian god of death.
 In a broader context, Moses represents much of what the Jews under the oppressive rule of Rome wanted Jesus of Nazareth to be. Moses was a liberator who came with the intent of freeing God's chosen people and bringing forth the wrath of heaven against their enemies.",1410825600,,1981,4.683908045977011

And, well worthy of the winning of the Academy Award Oscar for 'Best Original Song'. This brilliant, epic, animated portrayal of Moses and the parting of the Red Sea for the national freedom of the Lords' People - Israel, from the choke hold and tyranny of Egyptian bondage, is both captivating and entertaining. It depicts the rise of Moses as the adopted son of Egypt, to his fugitive escape, from it. Through the wilderness, the marriage to his wife Zipporah, his Burning Bush experience with the Lord and back again to Egypt, to watch the destruction of all that he once held near and dear, when the Lord smote Egypt with a variety of plagues. This Book of Exodus, animated depiction on the big screen is a winner, from start to finish. A family movie that everyone can enjoy and learn, from.

However it ends after they cross the Red Sea and left me wanting to see more of the Biblical account of their time in the desert and getting to the promised land. But I can see why the video is named Prince of Egypt because it is more about Moses struggling with his identity -- is he a son of Pharaoh Ramses the first, and brother to Ramses the second, rightfully a Prince, or is he a Hebrew slave or a Hebrew hero? In any case the film is magnificent in its animation, and has a beautiful sound track.

55220,5,078322995X,"This is easily the best that Dreamworks has ever done, in my experience, and yet it was done in 1998 and who talks about it anymore?  That's a shame because this is excellent.  In fact, other than simply recognizing that you cannot have everything in a film this length, the worst thing about it is Hotep (Steve Martin) and Huy (Martin Short), and they're not in it enough to ruin the movie, at least not for me, not even with their (thankfully forgettable and inessential) song ""Playing with the Big Boys Now"".  Other than that, the worst problem is a flaw of omission, not commission, which is that we don't get to see the Passover supper.  But at least the lamb's blood and its purpose haven't been glossed over.

While the movie takes a LOT of creative liberties with the exact words of Scripture, I find it is true to the spirit of the faith, being Catholic by faith and Jewish by ethnicity.  Moses loves Rameses like a brother, even when Rameses's choices make him stubborn and hard-hearted, and he sees no love for him in Moses but only hatred and enmity--yet never does Moses treat Rameses like merely a villain.  In fact, if there is any flaw, it's that perhaps Moses is too nice, not rebuking Rameses.  It's one thing to be humble, but Moses is on the side of right here, and would have authority to rebuke Pharaoh in the name of his Creator.  The story isn't 100% true to the facts of Scripture, but I'd say the spirit is there in abundance, and so I can excuse the liberties taken with the letter.  Better still, they manage to take an ancient story and make it timeless--these could be anyone today, even you or me, they just happen to live in ancient Egypt.

The songs are excellent too (barring ""Playing with the Big Boys Now""), and I especially like ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" and ""The Plagues""--and the Hebrew hymn straight from Scripture that serves as a ""bridge"" for ""When You Believe"".  Also, the cinematography is excellent, and usually I focus more on the characters and story in movies, but the cinematography did an excellent job of telling the story--we could get the story as easily, I think, if we watched this on mute.

Also excellent is the depiction of God--I especially like the Hebrew dub, where God says His Name: ""EHYEH...ASHER...EHYEH....""  It sounds primeval, like the first sentence ever spoken, even before the universe existed!  Yes...what else could God's Name be?  It's VERY hard to depict God on film and do Him justice without accidentally inviting blasphemy.  I liked how they didn't give Him a big, booming voice.  After all, what does the Creator of the entire universe have to prove to us puny mortals?  Besides, God is Love Itself, and He will condescend to our level, rather than overwhelm us, out of Love (and He knows what we're ready for).

Other than what I've said already, the main thing I don't like is the fact that the women are a little too empowered for the time period--that feels anachronistic.  I would have had Tzipporah showing a greater dignity, like the daughter of a high priest, in her introduction, rather than acting like a ""desert cobra""--in fact, that seems more like the old stereotype of the ""hysterical woman"" to me, not that I think anyone meant such.  Likewise, Miriam doesn't strike me as someone who ""have been a slave...all my life""--just the opposite, in fact, she's way too quick to take charge.  Aaron, on the other hand--oh wow, how do you cast Jeff Goldblum in an animated movie and have him disappear into the character?!  Especially when Steve Martin and Martin Short don't?!  Props to him and to whoever cast him and animated Aaron!

If there needed to be more, perhaps we could have seen more of Moses with his actual people, even though the main story thread was with him and Rameses (also why they ended the film where they did, because that thread was now over).  But again, the one major thing I would have liked to have seen that we don't get to see here is the Passover supper, with the unleavened bread, bitter herbs, and wine.  Still, at least we see the blood of the lamb saving the firstborn from death.  (And the depiction of the Angel of Death was probably the best it could be, especially having no score there at all!)

All in all, one of the most underrated movies ever!  Please go buy it and watch it!

55224,5,078322995X,"This movie is a great depiction of the Moses story in the Old Testament, in the book of Exodus. This movie tells the story of Moses and the Hebrews in slavery and the freeing of the through the Red Sea. This move is especially great for children to know where their religion came from. This movie is not only for Christians who beliefs in God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit, but a lot of people do not know, this is an Judaism story too. This story is in the Old Testament which is then Tanakh, which is the book for Judaism. This is a great movie to show Moses being put in a basket, he gets found and raised by a pharaoh and lives, and find out who he really is. I l think this one is really good with the way the movie is set up and how it is easy to understand. Also, the musicals in it did help a lot, the songs were beautiful. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to learn about the Moses story and recommend this to parents to let their children watch so they can get an understanding of what their religion is about and how it came about. The movie was in a cartoon form at first, and I was thinking to myself how could a college student learn from this movie but I did. The movie may look like a child movie, but the information in it gave me an insight to the meaning of my religion which is Christianity and also, gave me an insight to the Jewish religion which is Judaism. It helped me see the power of God and showed me first hand of the miracles he did for the people that believed in him. A must go see!!",1396828800,,1535,4.052631578947368

This movie was a great children's representation of what Moses' life was like in the Bible. Moses was born at a time where Pharoah was killing all the new born sons being born in Egypt. Moses real mother weaves a basket and sends baby Moses off down the river to hopefully get saved from the evil wrath. Sure enough, the Pharoah's wife was bathing in the river when the basket came upon her and her servants, when she opened the basket and found baby Moses inside, she instantly fell in love and ordered for Moses to be treated as her own. You see Moses grow up in luxury with an older brother, who seems to constantly get in trouble when they team up. In this life of luxury Moses is sheltered from the torment that pharoah is causing the jewish slaves until one day when Moses witnesses a man being horribly beaten and accidentally kills one of the men. God speaks to Moses after he runs away, and tells him and that if he just trusts in Him that God will take care of him and lead his people to safety. So Moses wanders and finds his way back to his real sister and brother, and becomes friends with the community. God tells Moses to warn the Pharoah that there will be great punishment if he does not let God's people go free out of slavery, however even after the community is plagued by horrible things, Pharoah still will not give in and let the people go. So God tells Moses to lead the people out of Egypt and God uses Moses to part the Red Sea. This created a gateway to people's faith along with a trust in God. Moses leads every last person to safety and just as he's walking through Pharoah's army is swept away by the waters that once stood divided so that God's people could be set free.

World Religion
This movie tied straight into Judaism and their faith for God as His chosen ones. This movie, even as an animated film for children is strikingly Biblically correct. This movie supports various Judaism facts represented in our book such as, Moses is known as one of the biggest Judaism prophet. He was a leader and teacher and played an extremely big role in the foundations and faith of the Judaism. It's no wonder they made the movie about him, he in the hebrew's eyes was known as the channel from God and them.

The movie mentions how Moses takes the hebrew slaves across the Red Sea and leads them to the promised land. Many people of the Judaism faith still believe that Moses was the founder that helped literally pave the way for their people. They believe that this was a sure sign that God saved their people once from horrible fate, and that He will be faithful to do so again when the time comes.

  Prince of Egypt

Plot Summary:
The Prince of Egypt is the story of the book of Exodus in the Bible. The Pharaoh of Egypt was killing all the Hebrew new born boys for fear that the Hebrews would grow in numbers and be able to overthrow the Egyptians. When Yocheved learned of the plan, she took her baby son, put him in a basket made of reeds, and sent him down the river Nile in hopes of saving his life.  The queen of Egypt found the baby, named him Moses, and raised him as her own son in the palace. When Moses grew up, he learned of his true identity and was torn. He no longer could live as a prince and watch his very own people be beaten as slaves. He ran and God found him. God sent him back to Egypt to save his people, and with Gods help and leading, the Hebrews were freed after years of slavery.

World Religion:
In the book, Invitation to World Religions, there is a commemorative stone that was inscribed at the request of Pharaoh Merneptah (an Egyptian ruler). On the stone was written Israel is lad waste, its seed is no more. When I started writing this summary, I wrote Israelites, but in the movie they are referred to as Hebrews. This movie is about the Exodus is the escape of Israelite slaves from a tyrannical Egyptian rule. Its said that the Exodus plays a profound role in Jewish beliefs and practices.
The authors of, Invitation to World Religions make a point of saying that the Exodus continues to be an event with very little credible evidence that it ever happened; yet to those that believe the Bible and to the Jews, this event remains one of the most important turning points in all of history. This Exodus to the Jews, was Gods willingness to intervene in history on their behalf. From this point in history on, Israel could no longer be considered a tribal community. They had now encountered the Creator; YHWH, and they were now bound together by a common faith in God. They were on the way to the land that had been promised to them through Abraham. This land was a gift that YHWH had given them, and as long as they were obedient to their God they would stay in this inherited gift.

What was a celebrated film upon its release now appears to be a hidden gem with the Dream Works Animation Studio's .  In a time of Blu Ray and digital media one would think that DWAS would have pushed to get this film out to the many clinging onto their DVD copies like me , in hopes of a truly superior release .
The DVD is filled with great picture and sound and holds up well for a film that is 16 years old .
The collectors edition is the finest set to date and one can only wonder when this will get a proper Blu Ray release .

55275,5,078322995X,"I admit it!  I have watched this movie over ten times!  It's that good.  The storyline is closer to the actual Biblical account than any other version of the Exodus saga that I've ever seen, though it does take certain literary liberties.  The animation is fantastic with expressions on the characters' faces that is seldom seen in animated movies.  The emotional content is unbelievable as well.  The music score is utterly stellar, beginning the movie  with the song ""Deliver Us"" as a hint at what is coming musically.  Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks has done it again with an utterly outstanding film.  It's a definite must see for adults as well as for children, but I do recommend that adults watch the film with children under 10 because the violence of the Egyptian taskmasters toward the Hebrew slaves is vividly depicted at times, especially at the beginning, and when the Egyptian taskmaster is beating an old man and Moses, having just learned that he is also Hebrew, takes action and accidentally kills the Egyptian to protect the slave.

55317,5,078322995X,"Prince of Egypt tells the story of Moses and his journey from prince to biblical hero in an easy to understand format for children and adults alike. With stunning animation and a soundtrack that will both thrill you and bring tears to your eyes Prince of Egypt is a masterpiece. In the beginning we see Moses being sent down the river Nile by his mother as she sings in Hebrew, adding another beautiful element to the film with traditional language. Through sweeping orchestral moments and beautiful animation Prince of Egypt entertains and educates. Prince of Egypt has moments of suspense and sometimes darkness, such as when the 10 plagues are portrayed. It also has moments of Joy, such as when the sea is parted and they attain victory over the Egyptians. Overall, Prince of Egypt is well worth watching and is entertaining for all ages.
The story of Moses is one of the most important storys in Judaism and this movie does an incredible job of portraying it. While in the biblical story of Moses his mother places him in the reeds, not in a basket in the river, the moment gives an excellent time for a song in Hebrew that helps make the connection between an animated film and a religious story. The use of traditional language in the film offers an even better connection to the biblical and religion meaning behind it. The moment where Moses kills a guard in defense of a slave is a critical moment in both the movie and in Judaism. It is in that moment that Moses turns his back on his Egyptian life and turns to god, leading him down the path to become one of the most well known biblical characters of all time. The 10 plagues and the freeing of the slaves are portrayed beautifully and in a way that anyone can understand, relating back to the Torah at many moments in the film. Prince of Egypt makes it easy to relate the story from the Torah to young children and adults alike.",1379894400,,1892,4.518950437317784

The film tells the story of the legendary Bible hero Moses and his rise to greatness in Egypt, his flight from Egypt, and then his return to deliver the Israelite slaves from the oppression of Pharaoh. Much the Joseph film, there is strong and moving music throughout.

My complaint would be that the story is not accurate in many instances. While the writers for Joseph took some creative license, they did not deviate as much from the true Biblical storyline as the writers for Prince of Egypt did. That being said, I rented the movie for 48 hours, and my kids watched it 2x with thorough enjoyment. Their only complaint was that they hoped the 10 plagues would have had a more expanded role in the movie. Only a few plagues were detailed, and the rest were lumped together in a quick snapshot.

The music and the voice of the Israeli singer Ofra Haza (now deceased) is magnificent and completely in tune with the subject, adopting cadences and motifs that go incredibly well with the Egyptian background. The story is very well informed based not only on the biblical narrative but in the interpretations and commentaries of the ancient rabbi's which reflect their way of understanding biblical events far removed from their own time.

55443,5,078322995X,"This movie is about the book of Exodus in the Bible,it is the story of Moses. It starts when Moses's mom put him in a basket and Pharoah's wife found him. It explains how he was raised in the palace and how he and Ramses were raised as brothers,and how after finding out that he was a Hebrew he left. God spoke to Moses through a burning bush, and He returns to Pharaoh and asks him to let his people go, and Pharaoh refused each time until God sent the Angel of death to kill the first born in each house. After that Pharaoh let the people go only to come after them and that's when God parted the Red Sea. Moses was also given the Ten Commandments.
This story relates to the story of Passover, when God told Moses to tell Pharaoh if he did not let his people go, he would kill the first born of every household. So God told his people to put Lamb's blood on the door of each house and if the blood was on the door he would have the Angel of Death pass them over, and their children would live. It really helps you understand what the Passover is really about. In Jewish customs they retell this story at the Seder Meal,and every child gets to participate. With the eating of the unleavened bread to remembering of the urgency of the departure, bitter herbs as a reminder of slavery,this story is retold. The Passover celebrates the liberation from bondage in Egypt and the springtime advent of new life.(p. 284)",1364688000,,1413,4.295880149812734
55444,4,078322995X,"The Review of The Prince of Egypt
The movie, The Prince of Egypt shows the life journey of Moses. Moses was born to a Hebrew other, Yocheved and had a brother named Aaron and a sister named Miriam. The Pharaoh Seti I orders that all Hebrew babies be taken and killed.  Yocheved sets Moses off in a basket down the Nile River hoping he will be found and saved.  The basket makes it ways to the Pharaoh's palace where he is found by the queen. The queen keeps the child and names him Moses.  He was raised as their biological son along with his brother, whose name was Rameses.  As the brothers got older they became reckless in their behavior.  They were in chariots that caused them to destroy major sculpture. The Pharaoh reprimanded them both and he feared that their behavior would destroy their family dynasty considering that Rameses was next in line for the throne. Moses talks to his father and tells him to give Rameses an opportunity to prove himself.  The Pharaoh names Rameses as Prince Regent and Moses the Royal Chieg Architect.  As a gift the high priests gives Tzipporah to Rameses, who in turn gives her to Moses. She escapes and Moses goes after her into the Jewish settlement.  In the settlement he discovers his sister Miriam, who explains what happen to him at birth and his brother Aaron. He goes backs to the palace, where he finds out that the story is true.  The next day Moses notices a slave being whipped and tries to stop but he ends up knocking a guard off a high landing, which caused him to die. Knowing the penalty of killing a person, Moses attempts to run away, but is stopped by Rameses, who tells him that he will not be punished.  Moses refuses his brother's word and goes into the desert.  Moses comes across the home of The High Priest of Meridian.  He eventually marries his daughter and learns to live the life of a common shepherd.  Through this he discovers that he loves his new life of worshiping God. One day while he was herding sheep, God came to him and told him that the people in Egypt was being held in oppression and that he was the one who would deliver the Hebrews from slavery. Moses returns to his home land to find out that his father has died and his brother is now the Pharaoh.  Moses tries to convince his brother to release the slaves by showing him God's power, but he refuses to release the slaves.  This only caused Rameses to increase the workload of the slaves. Moses causes the Nile River to turn to blood and plaques to hit Egypt, but none of these events causes Rameses to change his mind.  Moses gathers the slaves and eventually leads them out of Egypt by parting the sea that causes Rameses army to drown.
The movie shows accuracy and relevance to what we have been taught over the years concerning the Bible and the story of Moses.  The main purpose of the story was to capture the story of Moses and explain it in a cartoon view to help children to understand it.  It is unlike most cartoons, it did not have animals talking, which made it even more realistic and accurate.  The movie shows the struggle of freedom and the courage it takes to fight opposition of right from wrong. It shows how a single event can change our way of thinking or believe from the way we have been raised, it definitely is an eye opener when you go outside of your comfort zone. Moses may never have found out the truth about his really family if he had not gone outside of the palace.",1364688000,,3439,4.404423380726699

MILD SPOILER.

The Prince Of Egypt is a faithful retelling of the first 20 chapters in The Second Book Of Moses Called Exodus. As stated at the beginning, ""Artistic and historical license has been taken,"" obviously to make the movie suitable for children, and therefore the textual and creative liberties taken are understandable. For example, Moses' cold-blooded murder of the Egyptian who is mercilessly scourging one of his brethren is changed to an accident. This is one of several differences those who have read the Biblical account and or viewed the 1923 or 1956 film versions of The Ten Commandments, both directed by Cecil B. DeMille, will notice. This version is suitable for the little ones, and discussion about the true story found in the Bible after seeing this kid-friendly version is strongly encouraged. The songs in the film are first-rate, the animation is absolutely stunning, the special effects are brilliant, and with the exception of the awful Boyz II Men (who?) song in the latter half of the end credits, I recommend that you cotinue watching the credits to listen to Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey's Academy Award winning song When You Believe. There are two quotations from The Holy Bible and, inexplicably, one from the so-called 'holy' quran or koran (or however those people spell it) at the conclusion of the end credits. Just thought you should be ware of it.

As for the song, ""Through Heaven's Eyes,"" I can't help but sing it every once in a while.

While the writer did not do an exact copy of what you read in Exodus, the deviations with new story made sense for developing the two princes' character arcs. Meanwhile the animation is solid and the voice acting spot on!

55498,4,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt is worthy of a lot of praise indeed.

Firstly, the film is so visually stunning, wonderfully grand and spectacular, gorgeously drawn, and originally designed that it's impossible not to be impressed. Character designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet worked absolute wonders with designing the people and animals of the movie.

Each individual character exhibits the same amount of love, care, and attention to detail that a human actor would in a live-action movie. Note the sharp contrast of the clean, white, angular lines of Egypt compared to the colourful, organic, natural lines of the Hebrews.
Note the awesome pyramids, sphinxes, temples and obelisks accurately recreated in all their original glory. Note the 10 Plagues of Egypt vividly brought to life on screen.
Note the grand moment when, as the Israelites cross the Red Sea, two huge whales are seen swimming in silhouette in the water. Note the awe-inspiring desert and mountain landscapes beautifully painted before your eyes.

Everything about this movie is a visual triumph!

Secondly, Prince of Egypt has a stellar voice cast - probably the greatest ever assembled in an animated film. It's a voice cast that directors dream about:
Val Kilmer - turning in a surprisingly emotional and fine role as Moses. Kilmer also provides the voice of God. Instead of the booming voice most of us would expect in such a role, Kilmer's God is as quiet as a whisper, and as gentle as the wind.
Ralph Fiennes - who's Rameses is unbelievably intense.
Michelle Pfeiffer - Zipporah, Moses's wife.
Sandra Bullock - Miriam, Moses's sister.
Jeff Goldblum - who's Aaron (Moses's older brother) is surprisingly emotionally acted. A standout role in a film of good roles.
Danny Glover - as a flamboyant Jethro, Moses's father-in-law.
Patrick Stewart and Helen Mirren - wonderfully acting Moses's adoptive parents.
And Steve Martin and Martin Short - who play two evil Egyptian priests.

On the whole, it's an amazing voice cast who perfectly portray their characters as if they were really acting as them. In particular, I was impressed (after watching Behind the Scenes Footage) how much of himself Ralph Fiennes put into his performance of Rameses.
And Val Kilmer? He proves that he's way more than Iceman from Top Gun. His Moses is a role of surprising depth and emotion.

And thirdly, Prince of Egypt has an awesome score. I'm not going to even try to describe it, but let it suffice to say that Hans Zimmer (quite possibly the greatest film composer ever) and Stephen Schwartz (Pocahontas, Enchanted) composed it, and that it contains a very beautiful, Oscar-Winning song famously sung by Mariah Carey and the late Whitney Houston - When You Believe.
As I said before, I'm not going to even try to describe it, so listen to it here (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-Of-Egypt-Music-From-The-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0086HINLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince Of Egypt: Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>), or better yet, watch the movie.

No really! - watch Prince of Egypt. It's a visually stunning, very well acted and scored, emotionally rich Dreamworks Triumph. (On top of that it's executive-produced by Steven Spielberg!)

55499,5,078322995X,"Plot Summary:
The film is based in Egypt and tells the story of Moses from the Bible. The story begins with a mother running away with her newborn baby, because there are soldiers looking for male infants in the area. The mother has no choice but to put the baby in a basket and set the basket in the adrift in the water.  The sister of the male infant sees that the baby was found by the Pharaoh's wife and when the baby is found she named the baby Moses.  The movie then moves forward with the baby growing up with the real son of the Pharaoh, Rameses and they are seen causing havoc in the town. Moses left the town due to killing a Guard by trying to protect a slave that was being beaten.  Moses wanders into the dessert where he collapses and is found by Tzippora, who was presented to him the night before as a gift, but he helped her escape.  Time went on and Moses married Tzippora, and became a part of their village.  Moses then found a burning bush and God told him to set his people free, so Moses returned to Egypt and confronted Rameses about letting his people go while all the time telling him there will be consequences from God if this doesn't happen.  Well, after all the punishment from God Rameses lost everything including a son, and then let the people of Israel go.  However, while Moses was leading the people Rameses followed and this is where the story of parting the Red Sea happens?  Then in the end of the movie Moses has fulfilled his goal and Rameses was seen alone on a rock in the middle of the sea. (Allen, 2013)

Relation to World Religion:
The Prince of Egypt is related to World Religions because is the story straight from Exodus in the Bible, which is an historic story within the Holy Bible and is known throughout the World as the great story of Moses. There are cross religious that are seen throughout this movie: Judaism and Christianity; however their translations of the story are seen as being different. The main difference was the name of God that was given within each religion, because in the Christianity religion God was ""I am who I am"" and in Judaism is was ""YHWH"" translated Yahweh. (Sustafson, 2010) The story is a part of history about listening to God and being used as his vessel to help his people who are suffering.  The story has helped to tell the power of God from how he made Rameses suffer to parting the Red Sea.  The story is well known and then movie was a great depiction of how the story was told in the Bible to seeing it played out on the Big Screen.

However, this movie constantly reminds me of the deep profundity of the Old Testament and how there was so much drama, action, and faithfulness. Normally when I read the Old Testament, it's not as ""easy"" of a task as say... reading my favorite news blogs. However, movies such as the Prince of Egypt really go to show the depth of the life of Moses, and how much strength and character was involved to really live a life commanded by God.

55526,4,078322995X,"""The Prince of Egypt,"" was released on December 18th of 1998 by Dreamworks Productions. In the past fourteen years, ""The Prince of Egypt,"" has grossed approximately $218,613,188. It tells the story of Moses' struggle to free his Hebrew people from the Egyptians. The story has been told since the times of the Old Testament, but this movie, produced mainly for children, tells it in a way that is easy to understand, and can been seen by all. Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells, were also nominated for an, `Annie,' under the category of Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production. Overall, the film has been nominated for eighteen awards, and won five.
  The story of Moses takes place in Egypt and Median. Moses was originally born in Egypt, but after discovering his ethnicity, he fled from Egypt to Median, where he met his wife, Zipporah. God later told him to go back to Egypt and fight to free his people.  Zipporah, his wife, remains very faithful to Moses throughout the movie. The two of them made a life for themselves in Median and had two children, Gershom and Eliezer. After Moses' talk with God at the burning bush, and he knew he had to go back to Egypt, she followed him with no hesitation. In order to support her husband, she picked up her life, left her family, and moved. To say the least, Zipporah was a very loyal woman.
  The plot of, ""The Prince of Egypt,"" can easily be divided into three parts. In the beginning, Moses lives with the Royal Family under the impression that he is an Egyptian prince. Ramses is known as his brother, and they get along very well.  In the middle, Moses discovers the truth about his Hebrew blood and family, and flees from Egypt to Median. Upon meeting her, he had stopped to rest when Zipporah and her sisters came to feed their sheep. Moses helped, and then went home with them to meet their father, who in turn gave him Zipporah and let Moses live with the family. In the final part of the movie, Moses returns and begins the long battle of freeing his people.
  A predominant theme in this movie was to stand up for what's right. When the pharaoh confessed that Moses was not of his blood, Moses knew that he couldn't live under a lie. At that point in his life, the right thing to do was to leave. However, later in the story, when God speaks to Moses and tells him to return to Egypt to free his people, he does this. Moses listened to God, and did the right thing when he stood up for the Hebrews. It was quite a struggle, but in the end, Moses prevailed.
  While watching, ""The Prince of Egypt,"" I couldn't help but compare it to the movie, ""Joseph: King of Dreams."" ""Joseph: King of Dreams,"" was released on October 27th, 2000; just three years after, ""The Prince of Egypt."" Both movies were made by Dreamworks Productions. Also, both movies are meant to educate children and families about biblical stories. In, ""Joseph: King of Dreams,"" Joseph is abandoned by his family and ends up in Egypt as a servant of the Pharaoh. In the Old Testament, Joseph and Moses are actually related. Joseph is a descendant of Moses' brother, Levi. However, Joseph would have never known Moses or Levi, as there was roughly a 400 year age difference.
  The thought of Moses running away from his problems, then having to come back to Egypt to fix what had been done wrong really resonated with me. This also connects back to the theme. Even though Moses somewhat ran away from his problems at first, he came back to fix it. Realizing a mistake and then correcting it is something that I'm sure everyone can connect to. Every single freshman is working on this right now in Mr. Lefstad's physical science class. It is something that Moses did that was very relatable, even though most of us were not prompted to do so after a conversation with God.
  Overall, I thought that this was a very good movie. It served its purpose as being an educational film, and I feel like I learned a lot from it. In fact, I have already recommended it to people. I encouraged both my Aunt LeAnne and my mom to watch it with me. They enjoyed it, as well. That being said, I thought that it was a little bit difficult to understand at times. Going into watching the movie, I didn't already know Moses' story. Luckily, my aunt was already very familiar with it. Periodically, we would have to pause the movie and she would have to explain certain parts to me. At one point, my mom even had to look online to find out why exactly Moses had been abandoned as a baby. So, although it can be confusing at times, I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to know more about the story of Moses.",1353801600,,4680,4.503537735849057

55532,4,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt was created in 1998 by Dreamworks productions.  An adaption of the book of Exodus, this movie follows the life of Moses and his odyssey in trying to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt.  Directed by Brenda Chapman,  Simon Wells, and Steve Hickner, The Prince of Egypt features songs written by Stephen Schwartz. The voice cast featured a number of major Hollywood actors in the speaking roles, such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Ralph Fiennes, Ofra Haza, Steve Martin and Martin Short, who sang their own parts. Other than those select 5 people, professional singers took over the musical numbers.
  Of the many characters in the movie, the specific characters that held the most attention and were shown throughout most of the story line were Moses, Ramses,  Miriam, Abraham and Tzipporah. The setting takes place in the general county of Egypt.  While a few different locations were visited, such as Tzipporah's land Midianites.
  The beginning of a movie takes place in a faraway time, a desperate mother places her newborn child in a woven basket and sends him sailing down the Nile River. Found by the Queen of Egypt, the boy, soon named Moses, is raised by the Queen as the brother of Ramses, heir to the throne. Many years later, Moses is confronted with his true heritage, changing his opinion on the events taking place in Egypt at the hands of his family, and resulting in the impairment of his relationship with his brother.  In the middle of the movie, Moses exiles himself from Egypt, and sets off looking for a purpose in life. Moses finds himself being contacted by God. Moses learns that his mission in life is to lead the Hebrews out of Egypt. In the end, Moses is confronted with his brother  and his new opinion of Moses, and attempts to fulfill the mission given to him by his God.
  The theme of this film is to always be yourself, and stand up for what you believe in. I say this because Moses learns of his true heritage, and although it was hard to leave behind his wealthy life, he knew that the morals and ways of his family were wrong. He stood up for what he thought was correct, and ultimately tried to save the lives of all the Hebrews, because it was in his blood, it was who he was.
  I could compare this movie to another movie called ""The Parent Trap,"" starring Lindsay Lohan. The two movies are similar because in the Parent Trap, Annie and Hallie  are two siblings who learn of their true relationship. They fight for the affection and acceptance of their peers and friends. This is like Moses and Ramses, who learn their true relationship, and later on fight for the affection and acceptance of their country and their father.
  My application is this movie to real life is that I am like Moses. I will always stand up for what I believe in. If My mother, Heather, is doing something that I know is against her morals and she will later regret, I will stop her. If I see something being done that I don't agree with and know isn't contributing to the common good, I do my best to stop it.
  To say this movie was good would be an understatement. This movie was great. It teaches you about standing up for what you believe in, always trying your best, and that family should always come first. However, this movie is not completely correct, as it is a film, it was adjusted for entertainment purposes, so it isn't completely accurate. I would recommend this movie to someone looking for a movie on life lessons, but if you want to learn the story of Moses, I would first recommend reading the original text.",1353196800,,3561,4.551724137931035
55541,5,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt, written by Philip LaZebnik, and Nicholas Meyer tells the epic story of Moses and his path to freeing the Hebrews. Dreamworks studios invested a great amount of resources into the making of this movie, in time, and money. The estimated cost of the film was around $70,000,000. This was money well invested, considering the animated movie grossed over $218,000,000 worldwide when it was released in 1998. Since then, the movie has become a beloved classic, not just watched for the religious meanings, but also for the literal devices, making it popular among certain Sophomore Language Arts classes.

There are many likeable and well-developed characters in the movie. There is the main character Moses, his ""brother"" ramses, and their father, the mighty Pharaoh Seti. During the middle of the movie,*SPOILERS* Moses marries Tzipporah, the strong willed girl that he helped escape from slavery in Egypt. Then, there was Moses' hebrew family, that included his brother Aaron and sister Miriam. I especially like his hebrew family because they risked their lives to save Moses when the Pharaoh ordered all of the hebrew males to be killed.

The beginning starts off with a remarkable intro scene that is rivaled only by animated movies such as The Lion King. Baby Moses is placed into a wicker basket and set afloat on the river Nile and narrowly escapes hungry crocodiles and fast moving boats. In the middle, Moses and his new brother Ramses cause mischief around the palace, but everything changes when *SPOILERS!* Moses discovers that the Pharaoh is not his real father! (Jerry!, Jerry!). The end has a great, heart-warming resolution when Moses reconciles with his hebrew family.

There are many great themes in the movie. One of the bigger themes that stood out for me was when Moses dropped everything in his life to help free the Hebrew people from the oppression of slavery. I believe that this is a great message that shows the theme of caring and sacrifice. Another theme present in the film was the theme of family. It showed how important it was to help your family. I believe this to be a great morale that anyone can understand.

This movie seems quite similar to Joseph, Master of Dreams because of their similarities in style. They both feature good 2-D animation and great storytelling. More specifically, Moses seems a lot like the main character Joseph in his personality, and their two stories of overcoming hardships to discover who they really seem quite similar. Having said that, I did enjoy The Prince of Egypt a little bit better. Either way, you'll be in for a treat no matter which movie you choose.

I couldn't make very many connections to the movie myself, because I am not religious. But, with what knowledge I had from reading Genesis beforehand, I thought that they did a very good job representing the Bible's messages in the movie. The animation team even took a trip to Egypt to ensure that their illustrations would be as accurate as possible. I thought that it was very cool that they did that to insure the maximum accuracy. When I spoke to friends that watched the movie who were religious, they said that the movie had a great deal of accuracy to it, and that the writers did a great job representing the Bible.

Overall, I thought that the movie was very good. I thought that it did a great job at representing the Bible's story, without sounding overly preachy. This part was very important to me, considering I am not religious. This is a great movie that tells the tale of Moses and his epic journey to free the Hebrews, and find himself in the process. So, religious or not, pick up this movie today, and watch!",1352937600,,3677,4.800947867298579
55542,3,078322995X,"The movie has some inaccurate details, some important. For example, in the movie, Moses was unaware that he was Hebrew, while in the original book of Exodus Moses was nurtured by his real mother and taught Hebrew customs. He did not worship Ra, Orion or Seth. His learning in the movie was added for dramatic effect. However, the movie was overall accurately portrayed. He was put in a basket in the Nile, he did kill a man and run away for it. Most importantly, he lead the Israelites out of Egypt by the divine command and guide of God.
The story was set in Egypt in the time from Moses' birth, to the time Moses got the Israelites to the far side of the Red Sea. Moses was at first portrayed as a joker and someone who generally gets into mischief. He was later portrayed as fearful and victimized (e.g. running away from Egypt, cowering from the burning bush). At the end he was portrayed as a fearless leader who only wanted to get his people to safety. The other characters, namely Ramases kept the same character traits through the entire movie. Ramases did not want to be the weak link in the chain of Pharaohs, Jethro was kind and inviting, Aaron wanted his brother to look out for more than just himself, and Miriam was very protective of both Moses and Aaron.
In the beginning of the story, Moses is living a life of recreation, he knocks noses off of statues, he dumps punch on the magicians and always sticks up for his brother when his brother gets in trouble, but when he throws an Egyptian man from a scaffold, he is forced to run from his home. In the middle, the movie documents him living a few years in the wilderness and getting married to a woman named Zaporah. He is then told to go to Egypt by God through a ""burning"" bush. In the end God plagues the Egyptians until Pharaoh lets the Israelites go (the final plague being the passover). Pharaoh, being the smart guy he is, decides to go after them. The Egyptians are drowned when the Red Sea only holds up for Moses. Then Moses takes the ten commandments down from Mount Sinai.
The main theme displayed throughout the movie is slavery is wrong. The emphasis was on the scenes where Hebrews were being beaten or whipped. One such scene drives Moses to kill the taskmaster in the first place. This is also true whenever Moses confronts a Pharaoh about the killing of all the male babies, the response is always ""They were only slaves"". At one point in the movie Moses makes the statement ""No country should be built on slavery"". All of these things point to the anti-slavery message.
 Of all the movies and books I could compare Prince of Egypt to, the first that came to mind was another children's movie; Toy Story 3. In both stories the main character leaves, unhappy with the state of their people, and later returned to rescue them. In Toy Story 3, Woody is unhappy with his friends' choice to leave Andy to go to daycare. This drives him to leave his people (like Moses did). He later finds people that take him in and accept him as family.",1352678400,,3018,4.447653429602888

New take on biblical recount of Moses, stressing how the sibling bond between Moses and Ramases was effected.

55558,5,078322995X,"I like this movie a lot. Actually, I like it better than DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"". They are quite different, of course, in spite of telling the story of the same main character, and having as a reference a book that has been around for a very, very long time. But Dreamworks acknowledges it has taken some liberties with the basic story, which DeMille did not. He tried to be as faithful to the Book as possible. Frankly, it's more interesting this way.

The story opens with the basket in the bulrushes, much like DeMille's, although Moses' Hebrew mother has a lovely little song (which he later remembers when his sister Miriam sings it), and there's some amusing scenes about the perils the basket encountered before it got to the Pharaoh's wife's hands. (In DeMille's, as I believe in the Book, it is Pharaoh's daughter.) Ramses is a toddler at the time.

When we see Moses and Ramses again, they are racing their chariots, wrecking havoc on the construction site they race through. They are acting like brothers, and as far as they know, they are brothers. Ramses is the elder and the one who will become Pharaoh, but Moses is a Prince of Egypt (hence the title).

By happenstance, Moses encounters Miriam and Aaron, his real sister and brother, and as mentioned, remembers the song Miriam sings. He goes back to the palace full of conflicts over the possibility that he was born Hebrew: a slave. He has a dream which is very well done, with the illustrations along the walls moving and some very clever animation, where, for example, the pictures of his mother and sister and brother hide from the pictures of soldiers running along the walls by going around onto the pillar in front of the wall. All flat pictures, but they move around the pillar and get away.

Moses realizes that Pharaoh, who he has always considered his father, was responsible for killing a lot of Hebrew babies when he was an infant, and that was in fact why his mother had put him in the basket in the river. Pharaoh talks about how ""sacrifices sometimes have to be made,"" but ruins any sympathy Moses might have had for his situation by adding, ""After all, they were only slaves.""

Moses runs away into the desert, where he meets up with the Medians, including Sephira, the slave girl (captive) who had been given to him as a gift by Ramses, and which he allowed (indeed helped) to escape. She introduces him to her father, the high priest of the Medians. They adopt him, he marries Sephira, and becomes a shepherd. However, one day when he is chasing a runaway sheep, it goes into a cave and he is confronted with the famous burning bush.

You know the story. He goes back to Egypt and insists that Ramses, now the Pharaoh, must let his people go. There's a very amusing scene where the Pharaoh orders the Egyptian priests to show up the snake Moses has conjured, and they do a splashy production number, singing ""You're Playing With the Big Boys Now."" It is well to note that these are the same two priests that Moses and Ramses had doused with water and wine from a balcony when they were teens. The production number is very clever.

From here, it's a pretty direct telling of the story in the Book. There's some great music, the animation is terrific, and I especially loved the little kids. The crossing of the Red Sea is awesome, which is as it should be. But there's nothing more than a closing scene of Moses carrying a pair of tablets down the mountain side, nothing of the golden calf at all.

It's a terrific movie, no matter what your religion.",1337385600,,3542,4.566929133858268

The 30 K-6th grade students just loved it. They're pretty active, and this was the most engaged I've seen them all year.  We previewed it, and explained to them before the viewing that a lot of the story was out of the Bible, and some was just Hollywood, making an exciting story. There's a scene at the beginning about Moses life as a young man in the Egyptian court that is fantasy. The kids were so excited when the film got to the burning bush scene. They watched for the plagues when the DVD got to that part.
The teachers agreed that these kids will definitely remember the Moses story from the DVD. This movie was a nice change of pace from our usual activities.
I would definitely preview and talk to children about what's in the Bible and what is written into the story. It was interesting to look in the Bible for details, and it might even be a good activity to get older kids into critiquing this and separating fact and fiction.",1333324800,,1114,4.402912621359223

The film portrays Moses and the natural son of the daughter of Pharaoh, Ramses, the woman who saves him from the Nile, growing up together and liking each other very much. Ramses will become Pharaoh. This brotherly love remains until the end of the film and highlights that all people are human and deserve love, and it adds a sense of pathos to the tale.

Perhaps not a good movie for children due to the content (the film doesn't flinch from the killing of the male infants, the plagues, or violence against slaves), but something that aims for and satisfies an adult audience with the richness of its storytelling and its impeccable animation.

Moses knew he was a Hebrew the entire time. The film has him find this out  in an overly dramatic scene with  a lullaby .

Moses killed the Egyptian on Purpose and hid him in the sand. This film has him do it by accident in a fit of rage with everyone present and able to see.

Moses was eighty Years Old when he went to see Pharaoh. The film has him very young looking.

He was not friends with Pharaoh in his youth. This movie says he was.

Moses did not meet Zipporah in Egypt as he did in this film.

Pharaoh agrees to let the Hebrews Go several times but always goes back on the deal whenever the  current plague leaves the land. This movie never even alludes to that fact.  Just has everything happening at once.

The Prince Of Egypt Movie Review
  The Prince of Egypt is Disney's adaptation of the story of Moses in the book of Exodus. The movie starts out with a mother putting her baby in a basket in the river in order to save her son because at this time in Egypt the Pharaoh ordered that the first sons be exterminated. The basket floats to the royal palace where the queen takes him in as her own child where she names him Moses and he grows up with a brother, the one true son of the Pharaoh, Ramses.  The brothers grow up with a close brotherly bond. One night Moses is in the city and Marian, his birth sister sees him and tells him that he was born from her mother and that God saved him to be their savior from their oppressed life as slaves. He does not believe her until he has a dream of his past being shown to him and finds the paintings of the Hebrew sons being thrown over a cliff. He travels the desert to a town where he becomes a shepherd and marries a woman. In this town where he is residing he ventures into a cave where God speaks to him. God reveals himself as the God of his ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He tells Moses to go and free his people of Egypt and that he will be by his side the whole time and when the Pharaoh will not listen he will smite Egypt. Moses travels to Egypt with his wife to tell the Pharaoh, now Ramses, to free his people, the Hebrews. Ramses will not free them and as he sends his guards to capture Moses God tells Moses to put his staff into the water and so then the water turns to blood. When the Pharaoh will not acknowledge the power of Moses' God, God sends the Plagues to Egypt. After that God tells Moses to tell his people to paint the doors with lamb's blood and those who do not have it will not receive the plague by God of the first born children dying. Since the Pharaoh's son was affected by the plague he gave Moses his permission to let his people go. So the Hebrews fled Egypt into the desert and headed towards the sea. The pharaoh and his army went after them to trap them at the sea. Moses then walks out to the sea and parts it so the people can cross. They reach the other side and are free.
 This movie relates to world religions western chapters. It is the story of Moses in the book of Exodus of Judaism. Not only does the story of Moses serve a purpose in Judaism but it is also referenced in Christianity in the holy bible and in Islam in the quran. It is a story of liberation if one believes which is the basic teachings of all three of these western religions.",1303603200,,2579,4.119284294234593
55593,4,078322995X,It almost seemed as if this was a bootleg copy based on the cover quality and the slightly shaky image of the movie. But it's good enough for the price I guess.,1302220800,,160,4.03125
55594,3,078322995X,"The DVD is ok. The animation is colorful but too dark at times. I am showing it to my Wednesday night children's Bible study class, we have learned about Moses up to the first Passover. The movie does a good job of covering the first Passover but it skips over details about the 2 - 8th plague. I wish they had shown some scenes of Pharoah first saying that the Israelites could go, and then changing his mind after the plagues were lifted by God. The 9th plague is portrayed fairly well also.
I am not sure if the Pharoah was raised as Moses' brother, it doesn't make that too plain in the Bible. That could've been the case which makes the story more interesting. Although I do feel if that had been the case, then the Bible would've mentioned the irony of it. But it's still an excellent lesson of God's people and how God worked with them and through them.

Although this is not a Disney film (rather one created by Jeffery Kazenberg and Dream Works just after Katzenberg left Disney) it is based on a biblical story. The film does not live up to the ""hype on the jacket...masterpiece ...one of the top animated films of all time,spectacular entertainment,a classic for all ages,  but it did win an Academy Award for best musical score. I plan to use it to contrast what the Bible says versus how it was portrayed on the screen. However, it does tell the story of Moses that appeals to children, and a visual tool like this always helps helps children understand history. I also plan to use Cinderella, and provide them with several other versions of Cinderella- as Disney did not create the story, just a motion picture classic, the Sword in the Stone, based on the Arthur legends, and others.

There is action, ethics, history, and of course, human values in the psychology of brothers and family.  It is also visually stunning with a wonderful sound track.  And the voice characterizations!  Completely believable and moving.  That makes for a compelling viewing experience that you find most often in Disney, so it is nice that for a time there was some competition with Disney.

I kept comparing it to the version with Yul Brenner and Charlton Heston.  In that version, the brothers are loving but also severe and potentially deadly rivals, vying for the throne.  Moses is more loved than Ramses, who wants only power and apparently cannot even love, almost evil.  After his vision, Moses becomes otherworldly, losing much of his humanity as a prophet, whereas in the DW version he remains completely human and feeling, even on occasion unsure of himself.  Both have wonderful side characters, though their hard edges are avoided in the DW version.  Both interpretations are interesting and worthy.

55610,5,078322995X,"It was interesting picking up an early DreamWorks animated feature and to have it surprise and delight in their take on the story of Moses from the Old Testament.  In 1998 they decided to put together an animated feature that would combine a majority of animators and a minimum of CGI.  The result was quite good.

We are all familiar with the story of Moses but the way these creators wrote the tale was different than I'd seen say on The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston.  No, we have two brothers who grow up and love each other.  Moses is the practical joker and Ramses, destined for greatness as the Pharaoh, is teased and can't seem to take a joke.  The story depicted here does make changes from the Bible, as the film itself states at the beginning.  The story as given is a more human approach that I think children and families would better understand.  This is not your daddy's Bible class!

In the background are the Hebrew slaves.  When Hebrew children are being slaughtered, or the Hebrews are being squashed down, the usual Egyptian response was ""They're just slaves.""  This nonchalant, superior attitude was throughout the film.

Moses' doubt that he would even be chosen as a prophet was interesting.  His anguish that the first born sons of Egypt would be slain and his lament that no matter what, he still considered Ramses his brother was touching.

The movie was not heavy-handed in a religious way.  You could see the DreamWorks guys having fun with the parting of the Red Sea, the mysterious force that represented the Angel of Death and the sweeping desert vistas.  Great artwork!

Voice actors included Sandra Bullock, Patrick Stewart, Steve Martin, Val Kilmer and Jeff Goldblum among many others.  They did a great job here in vocal expression and tone that was believable and at times dark.

The ""Making Of"" feature on the DVD was fun to watch.  The artwork including sketches and production stills was bold and beautiful.  The art direction and discussion of computer techniques which may have been cool in 1998 are pretty much routine in today's CGI world.  However, to listen to them you get excited about the animation yourself.

Finally, The Prince of Egypt is a musical.  Lots of songs and music that give an overall theme of redemption and freedom.  Does the bright thread know that it is part of a tapestry?  No, it cannot see the tapestry but should take on its view.  Heavy stuff, man!

Music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz really made the movie what it was.  Quite a miracle of animation, a serious story, and if there was a fault, some of the characters were a bit too ""Disney-esque"" but that makes it a family film so it's all good.  Academy Award winner for Best Original Song 1998 ""When You Believe.""

Favorite scenes for me were the pillar of fire and the Red Sea split, the chariot race, knocking off the nose of the Sphinx, and moving heiroglyphs on the walls during the ""dream sequence.""  Excellent animation.

Recommended.

55613,3,078322995X,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but at the end was very disappointed.  I agree with another reviewer that the animation and creation of this film was very well done, but I was upset that it deviated from the Biblical account.  I assume this was done in an effort to make it more politically correct or palatable to children and those whose sensibilities may be offended by the events the film is based on as told by the Bible.  For those looking for a moral alternative to Disney's library of movies depicting witchcraft and fantasy, it's okay; it contains lies about what the Bible actually says, but it's better than some things a kid could watch...I guess.  I grew up learning about the stories in the Bible as they were written; unedited, blood, guts, fire and all and I'm glad I did.",1263081600,,806,4.537931034482758

A little eerie. But my children aren't particularly put out by that, and they keep asking to see it again and again. We've had it for a few months.",1260835200,,396,4.1558441558441555
55616,2,078322995X,"I first watched this film when it came out and disliked it.  After seeing clips again in my art classes that reminded me of how beautiful the animation was, I decided to give it another shot but came to the exact same conclusion that I had years ago- the film on the whole... doesn't really add up to an enjoyable experience in the end.

To start off with the positive aspect- the animation work itself, the movement and the character designs and the staging and the general artistry are stunning- whoever as in charge absolutely knew what they were doing and I applaud them.

On the other end the vocal section of the music varies from alright to insipid (""Playing With the Big Boys Now"" is one of the more terrible songs I've heard in an animated film), and while I knew to expect it knowing the story the continued demonization of one of my favorite ancient cultures in almost every single movie that addresses them is always disheartening.  Obviously there is more to a film than these things, but I can not give an honest analysis on more nuanced issues such as background orchestral music or the nuances of vocal performances however because of my largest problem with the film- it's unbelievably depressing.  ""Grave of the Fireflies"" depressing, without even the little pieces of cheeriness that film allowed itself.

""Prince of Egypt"" is depressing to the point where it becomes difficult to focus on anything else, and both my brother and I were left speechless at how what is meant to be a great story of triumph for a culture could drag itself into such a colossal downer.  I would certainly not expect them to turn something that many people take so seriously as a completely happy story, but there has to be -some- kind of balance one can strike between that and everything ending in utter depressing tragedy.

If you're a fan of the art of animation for its own sake or someone looking for a beautifully rendered cultural/religious touchstone and can handle a certain amount of violence in an animated film, I would recommend this for you.  I know there are many people who enjoy it and  I'm glad of that because a great deal of good work was put into the production.  But for myself, my brother who re-watched it with me, and several others I have spoken to, the way the story falls off into everyone miserable or dead is just too much to be able to glean further enjoyment out of it.",1260403200,4,2399,4.581775700934579

55618,5,078322995X,"I simply can't stand the CGI-animated films that have become a mainstream phenomenon for this new millennium. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monsters Inc., and Ice Age were done extraordinarily well, but now CGI is everywhere and I think I'm going insane for even staring at one of their DVD covers! Much of them are just plain horrible (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Barnyard, Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Cars, Surf's Up, etc.), but most traditionally-animated films haven't fared well either (Home on the Range, Curious George, etc.). Are we going to have to sit through more of these in the future? I have a feeling that we most certainly will.

Fortunately, we still have tons of 2D-animated classics that we can enjoy watching (in both DVD and Blu-Ray). The Lion King, Peter Pan, Fantasia, The Secret of NIMH, Treasure Planet, and many others still look beautiful and modern. These were made with great care, and most of them had solid scripts and memorable characters. One classic that really stands out is The Prince of Egypt. Created by Dreamworks, it tells the well-known story of Moses and his quest from God to free the Hebrews. Almost everything that you have read from the Bible are here: the burning bush, the ten plagues, the parting of the sea, and so forth. What really makes The Prince of Egypt so distinctive is that it's one of the few animated movies that actually takes its audience seriously. It has a slightly darker and much more serious tone, with images that would no doubt frighten little kids. There are still two comedic sidekicks that will certainly entertain the kids, but as a whole, the entire movie is just as mature as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There hasn't been anything like this since it's been released back in 1998.

What I love most about this movie is the animation. The 2D graphics are so beautiful and so detailed, that I literally couldn't help but sit there and stare at the awe-inspiring visuals. The water, the sand, the fires, the Ancient Egyptian architecture, everything is seen as top quality. There is one particular dream scene that's done in hieroglyphic form that looks pretty silly, but everything else is first-rate animation. The songs are very average (some of the weak links to this film). With the exception of the masterful ""When You Believe,"" they aren't very unforgettable. But the orchestral music by Hans Zimmer is quite spectacular. It amazes me every time I hear those North African motifs, and those echoing solos that are done by a soprano.

I can't help but admire The Prince of Egypt. It's just as epic as The Lion King. It's a shame that we never get to see animated films like these today; all we get now are 3D-animated films that have flat characters, weak plots, and endless pop culture references. I can only hope that either Disney or Dreamworks (or whoever) can make a film that's provocative as this one.",1255478400,,2896,4.764940239043825

However, it  was  pretty awesome when it was released a decade ago.  It's just beautiful in parts. Some of the prettiest colors you'll ever see on film have been in animated movies the last decade.  The parting of the Red Sea in here is awesomely-done by the artists. That scene also sported the best sound of any scene in the 99-minute film.

The songs in here were nothing special but they didn't detract from the story because they were all short. Regarding the story, I only wish they had gone into detail on the plagues instead of just lumping them all together. They could have had some jaw-dropping scenes with the locusts, etc.

55627,5,078322995X,"This 1998 animated smash hit musical about the Biblical Exodus combines all the drama, authenticity of costumes and location, and emotion of the time period from whence mankind was ultimately given the Ten Commandments.
 The commencement provides a view of an initially arid, serene, and timeless place whose calm is abruptly shattered by the brutality of the ancient Egyptian slave system and the anguished Israelis nearly crushed under its weight.
  The voice  of the late Israeli folk singer Ofra Haza takes over from the gospel choir's vocal lament of the Hebrew's plight, as the young slave mother Yocheved, who along with her older son and daughter (the latter of whom is voiced by  Eden Riegel) scurry to protect their infant son and brother from legalized infancticide.
 When so many women were unable to, Yocheved succeeded, placing her infant son in a basket and leaving  him to float on the Nile as her daughter, Miriam struggles to follow it. Through this retelling of the story, a mother's cries over parting with her child at the dawn of time echo through the ages.
 The journey in this version of the story, is not a smooth one. The basket encounters some realistic hazards of the Nile, including snapping crocodiles, hippopotami, and a fisherman's net before reaching its place of salvation, which ironically, is the royal palace, where the Pharaoh's wife (Helen Mirren) is playing with her toddler princeling at the river's edge. Young Miriam expresses relief at her brother's safety and prays for their eventual reunion and Moses' deliverance of their people from bondage.
 The Queen's ascenscion of the stairs with the rescued infant in the midst of the slave's continuing toil and agony around the palace is symbolic about the occasional initial subtleness of how Man's prayers may be answered.
 The Bible leaves us to guess about Moses' life as a prince of Egypt. This film paints a life of carefree recklessness for Moses( Val Kilmer) and his brother, Rameses( a serious and sometimes authoritarian Ralph Fiennes), but suggests Moses' behavior towards the opposite sex was tempered by his adoptive mother as we see in his treatment of the seized Midian girl Tzipporah( Michelle Pfeiffer), who will later have a major impact on his life.
 While this screenplay takes liberties with the story, it fleshes out a realistic scenario of how Moses may have learned of his true heritage via a chance encounter with his now-grown biological siblings(Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum), and in frustration and rage over their plight, kills a taskmaster in defense of a slave.
  Fleeing Egypt in devastation, he makes his way to Midian, and en route allows himself to be buried in a sandstorm in a very dramatic scene.
 True to Biblical form, he saves the daughters of a bison-like Jethro (Danny Glover) from brigands, and is welcomed the Sheik of Midian's tent. Brian Stokes Mitchell's exuberant rendering of "" Through Heaven's Eyes"" comes into play, chronicling Moses's life among the Midianites and marriage to Tzipporah.
 While searching for a lost sheep, Moses is addressed by God through the burning bush, and is told the time has come to lead Israel out of bondage.
 A reluctant Moses confronts his one-time brother at the palace with Tzipporah (in actuality, his brother, Aaron)in tow, and the realistic feelings Moses may have had about seeing his brother again are featured in this scene. But Moses stays focused on his mission. When letting his staff turn to a serpent  to demonstrate God's power, he is challenged by magicians Hotep and Huy ( Steve Martin and Martin Short, the film's comic relief), and defeats them. The song ""Playing With the Big Boys Now"" provides an education about  the deities worshipped by the ancient Egyptians.
 Life for the slaves becomes harder before things improve. But Miriam encourages her brother , and the long-suffering slaves are shielded from the 10 plagues through which the Egyptians will suffer before God's will is done on Israel's behalf. Huy and Hotep come across as a pair of Ancient Egyptian Amway salesmen when explaining the first plague to Pharaoh.
 Pharaoh forgoes the final opportunity to free the Hebrews before the final plague is sent; its aftermath reveals Moses at his most humane, weeping for a boy to whom he might have been an uncle.
 Slowly, subtly and benignly, the day of deliverance dawns.
 The Exodus begins and is summed up in the reverent song, ""There Can Be Miracles When You Believe"" . Fear and anguish subside. Joy and dignity are abound . Children who previously cowered and hid play openly in a soul-stirring moment as the newly liberated travel over the Sinai.
 An embittered Pharaoh and his army pursue the former captives. But Moses parts the sea,and a pillar of fire bars Pharaoh and his hosts from reaching them. The nighttime sojourn through the parted sea is more dramatic here than in the 1956 version of ""The Ten Commandments"".
 Pharaoh's continued pursuit of the Israelites is to his own detriment.
 While Moses' deals with emotional issues  pertaining to the permanent separation from Rameses,  he soon joins the Israelites in rejoicing at their defeat.
  The vocal talents of Patrick Stewart as Sethi, and the singing talents of Amick Byram (Moses), Sally Dworsky ( Miriam), Donnie McClurkin, Shira Roth, et al complete this superb retelling of the ancient tale. While not completely recommendable for young children, it is a masterful and stirring work of art. A triumph from the crew of Dreamworks!",1226620800,3,5501,5.007683863885839

55641,4,078322995X,"Being animated, this is expectedly directed towards a younger audience. That does not keep it from being acceptable to older viewers, however. It generates enough interest to be worthwhile to all viewing ages.

It tells the story of Moses, born to Hebrew slaves and raised as a prince of Egypt. When he learns of his origins, he flees Egypt only to be called to return. He has been chosen by God to lead his people out of slavery.

While this tells the same basic story as the Charlton Heston epic, it focuses on different events and has, of course, a more childish approach. The crossing of the Red Sea is the undoubted climax but other than that, the whole tenor is different. It brings out some parts of the story left out of the classic. Moreover, it emphasizes a friendship between the young Moses and crown prince rather than a rivalry.

The songs seem a bit out of place but, for me, they always do in a musical. This once has an Academy Award winner, though, so I guess the music is good if you like your characters to break into song at the drop of a hat.

For those interested in the biblical content, its not too bad. There is not much emphasis on God but there are not any large scale contradictions of scripture either.

I prefer the classic version but the kids seemed to like this one.",1187654400,3,1300,4.4
55642,5,078322995X,"When I first heard that Steven Spielberg and friends were making an animated version of the story of Moses and the Exodus, I was nervous that they would sanitize or reconstruct history or religiously neuter Moses. ""Prince of Egypt"" is the opposite: a wonderful, highly researched and magnificently filmed movie that is an animated version of the brilliant rabbinic tradition of midrash, the rabbinic literary device that answers questions and fills in gaps about stories in the Hebrew Bible. To my relief, the story stays true to the *Israelite* experience ... while freedom from slavery is obviously a universal value, this was - after all - a *Jewish* moment in history.

The characters are 3-dimensional (so to speak): Moses is the doubter who eventually must successfully confront his own fear and faith; Aaron, the peacemaker who frequently gets lost in the family dynamic; and - the biggest character treat for me - Miriam, the dynamo partially responsible for the infant Moses' survival: for the first time, a Jewish woman who actually looks like a *Jewish* woman (and no, I'm not talking stereotypical Eastern European - this Miriam is a blend of Ashkenazi and Sephardi).

The music is a special gift, especially the voice of Israeli singer Ofra Haza, who tragically died less than two years after making the movie. I was excited to hear real Hebrew Bible text.

The effects are spectacular - from the hieroglyphics that come to life during an especially frightening dream sequence to the sheer brilliance of the depiction of the plagues (the death of the Egyptian first born is especially harrowing).

We've happily come a long way from the wooden theatrics, pseudo-Jewish theology and cone bras of the Cecil De Mille classic. This ""Prince of Egypt"" is a wonder.",1186012800,2,1771,5.01360544217687

55648,5,078322995X,"I am tremendous fan of good-quality animation but a movie is only worthwhile as long as it is accompanied by good-quality storytelling. ""The Prince of Egypt"" tasks some risks in altering the text of the story of Exodus but it manages to deliver both on its big-budgeted epic scale.  No one can replicate Charles Heston's 1956 performance yet I found this film to be a respectable homage to DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"". Plus the kids will learn a thing or two.

In the past 10 years we've seen far too many computer-animated slapstick films spurted out like candy bars from a vending machine. Disney took us ""to infinity and beyond"" with Toy Story and ""Antz"" was a good laugh. But honestly, it's sad to see how many companies are cutting corners and neglecting the beauty that traditional animation can capture.

""The Prince of Egypt"" does neither. It maximizes the potential of its time by using hand-drawn animation to capture the beauty and details of the Egyptians' tunics and the woven tents of Midian. At the same time computer effects bring an intricate nightmare of hieroglyphics to life. It looks more than neat. It looks damn good. And the other factor is the degree of brutality that this film can push into a PG rating without overdoing it. (They come pretty close, though.) The slaves are beaten and we see the weariness in their sagging eyes. Moses' face shows utter horror when he kills a man. The Egyptians scream with fear when plagues manifest their lives. We're not in Disneyland anymore, kids. (And even the first Disney films were creepy: ""Snow White"", ""Pinnochio"", and even ""Dumbo"" just to name a few.)

I was more nitpicky about the character alterations, especially Aaron, who is depicted as the skeptic one. No doubt it is intended to contrast Miriam's rock-like belief in Moses but I found it offensive. At least Dreamworks stayed clear of annoying sidekicks and had two oily scheming magicians-Steve Martin and Martin Short need no introduction-with a few tricks up their sleeves. Ramses' transformation into Pharaoh consumes him with pride until his empire is destroyed. As for Moses, his journey is an extraordinary tale and yet relatable to anyone who embarks on a new challenge be it personal, social, moral, or spiritual.

I found the music heart wrenching and unforgettable. Many of the songs are a blend of prayers asking for help and the lyrics only amplify what they are saying, especially when the children sing ""Song of the Sea"" in Hebrew in gratitude as they leave Egypt. The splitting of the sea IS the impression that DeMille would've done if he could've done it in his time. I was overall impressed with this film adaptation of Exodus. The catchphrase ""family film"" doesn't do it justice. It is a work of art in itself and a respectable piece of faith and effort in its time.",1178668800,,2821,4.820247933884297

55651,5,078322995X,"Before they basically made movies full of jokes without a sense of heart, Dreamworks did Prince of Egypt. Dreamworks was pretty much a new company at the time and had a degree of success with Deep Impact and Antz. But a falling out prompted former Disney head Jeffrey Katzenberg to start the company with one of the big projects being this. While it's a fine film to appreciate and there are times where I was almost stunned by the animation, it does other things wrong and it's hard to figure out where they are but they're in here.

Re-telling the story found in Exodus, the story centers on Moses, a young Egyptian prince who's brash and very little compassion for the Hebrew slaves that are working hard to build whatever the Pharoah commands them to. When Moses sees the lack of decency and heart in the Pharoah and Moses' brother Rameses, Moses flees. Years later, an encounter with God gives him the strength and gifts to free the Hebrew slaves, even if it means unleashing plagues upon Egypt.

First, I'll mention what doesn't work: the music. I don't know; it's one of those things that should work but either I didn't like the songs themselves or I just simply thought they should've been taken out altogether. I did like the song ""When You Believe"" but the rest I can't remember at all, except for what scenes they were in. However, the score by Hans Zimmer is quite excellent with some really great cues. But in some cases the sound effects (such as the Red Sea stuff) practically drowns out the score sometimes. The voice acting, still following the new-school tradition of having big name stars, is still in place but at least they're quite good in their roles, especially Val Kilmer.

But ultimately the star of the film is ultimately the animation. Combining 2D and 3D elements that still manage to be better blended than most films, everything just looks top notch from backgrounds to character animation such as a full-on shot of a woman crying. And then of course we have individual scenes such as the Passover plague, the hailstorm, the pillar of fire and of course the show-stopper: Moses parting the Red Sea and its eventual closing. Even after so many years, they're still impressive scenes and luckily the DVD transfer brings them out clearly.

While I doubt I'd buy the film, watching it did have a really enjoyable film and would be a good one to watch. Too bad the company started to produce laugh-only films after this.",1174867200,,2447,4.6705336426914155

55654,5,078322995X,"*Prince of Egypt* is about Moses' escape from Pharoah's death order to the crossing of the Red Sea.  Overall, it was a wonderful animated movie.

The movie opens with Moses' mother and siblings trying to escape from Pharoah's order that all Hebrew boy, of a certain age and below, were to be thrown into the river to drown.  Moses' mother was able to arrive the Nile River, which she placed Moses in a basket and sent him off.  He is discovered by Pharoah's wife.

Moses has been raised as the adopted son and prince of Egypt, along with Ramses, the true heir.  They're like any other brothers...challenging each other and getting each other in and out of trouble.

However, there came a time when Moses learned of his true heritage and is troubled.  After murdering a guard, while protecting a Hebrew slave, Moses escaped to the desert.  In the desert, he met Zipporah, who later became his wife.

Soon after, God appeared to Moses in the form of a burning bush.  Moses is instructed to return to Egypt to free the Hebrews and lead them to the land flowing with milk and honey.  Reluctantly, Moses complied.

From here on out, the animation are just wonderful as we seeing Moses confronting Ramses, who is now the Pharoah.  We see the seven plagues that have struck Egypt because Ramses has refused to let Moses' people go.  Eventually, Ramses gave his permission.  However, soon after he gave his permission, he changed his mind and pursued Moses.

The scene involving the parting of the Red Sea was just magnificent.  I thought it was just a fabulous idea of showing a shadow of a whale swimming by.  It was just truly awesome.

Overall, it was one of the best animated films that I've seen.",1173657600,2,1694,4.60200668896321

What bothers me about it is how it deviates from the Bible account of God's deliverance of his people from Egypt.  It also adds much to the Bible account that is not there.  For example, Moses is a young man in this whereas he should haave been 80.  Aaron did not go with him to Pharoah as the Bible tells us; instead they send zipporah with Moses.  The boyhood friendship between Ramses and Moses is completely fabricated - it's not in the Bible at all.  I think it would have been so wonderful if they had stuck to the facts.  The truth of what really happened is so much more exciting.  By the way, my 3-year old will not watch it - she is too upset by the babies being thrown  in the river.

I've seen the story of Moses portrayed in several films, but this version has to be the very best of them all. Moses, as everybody knows, is born into a family of Hebrew slaves in ancient Egypt. The pharaoh fears that the Hebrews will become too numerous and rebel against the Egyptians, and so he sends out his soldiers to slaughter every male infant born to the Hebrews. Moses' mother, Yocheved, takes her young son and flees to the Nile River, where she sends him adrift in a special basket. The basket floats all the way to the royal palace, where the pharaoh's wife finds it. She has compassion on Moses when she sees him, and she takes him in and raises him as her own. She already has one son, Rameses, who becomes Moses' big brother. Years later, Moses and Rameses are all grown up, and getting along like very good friends. Moses is perfectly happy living a life of luxury, but then he learns the terrible truth about his childhood, and soon everything is changed forever.

Anyone who is not affected by this movie would have to have a heart of stone. This movie is just so beautiful. And the story it teaches is simply priceless. I recommend this movie to anybody, whether or not they attend Sunday school regularly. Even those who don't believe in Moses, or even in God, may find this movie appealing.

I hope this movie wins a million awards.",1160352000,5,1605,4.4709897610921505
55660,3,078322995X,"I have always had a certain fascination with the people and culture of Ancient Egypt, and I suppose this animated film about the biblical story of Moses and the exodus of the Jews from Egypt helped foster that interest. This is not surprising, however, as it is one of the most visually breath-taking and thematically powerful animated films ever made, and is that rare bird; a ""cartoon"" that is truly a work of art, second only in visual splendor to Rintaro's ''Metropolis'' and in emotional grandeur and realism to Isao Takahata's ""Grave of the Fireflies."" It is even comparable at times with Lean's ''Lawrence of Arabia'', as in the scene in which a forlorn Moses wanders through the vast Egyptian wilderness of desert, painted in evocative reds and blacks, across which stinging winds swirl.
 The story recorded in Exodus of Moses and his liberation of the Jewish people from bondage is certainly not without interest on both a theological and emotional scale: and in ''The Prince of Egypt'', while unusually complex in the psychological realism of it's characters and it's depiction of their emotional struggles by animated film standards, is still perhaps not the most thematically sophisticated of films, the latter is exploited to it's fullest potential, with the possibly imaginary yet still poignant and compelling rivalry between Moses and and his adoptive brother Rameses, as well as Moses childhood abandonment and upbringing in the royal house of the pharaohs, his discovery of his true identity, etc. etc. lending depth to these characters, aside from their usual, somewhat simplistic role as saints/villains.
 It is true that the film-makers take certain liberties with the elements of the original story, embellishing and enhancing them, though it is not hard to see why: after all, though not devoid of emotion, ''Exodus'' is more of a theological tract than an entertainment. Thus the film-makers, in order to appeal to their key demographic of families and kids (though this is as much a movie for the art-lover and film buff as it is for the five year old, perhaps more so), felt the need to flesh it all out a bit with some drama and (very good) musical numbers. It may sound somewhat questionable to the more religious, but rest assured, it works. It all works, everything from the music, the way in which the element's of the ''plot'' are woven into a resonant whole, and the animation. Especially the animation.
 Which is where ''Prince'' is king. Returning to the subject of animation, the rich tone and atmosphere of Ancient Egyptian civilization comes alive in this picture as never before, in a manner to rival any motion picture, animated or otherwise, before or since. Remarkably detailed Hieroglyphs depicting the massacre of Jewish babies adorn the chambers of the royal catacombs. As the infant Moses drifts down the nile in his famous basket of reeds, the waters of the river reflect and undulate in an uncannily life-like and convincing manner, as the oars of Egyptian barges pound the waves and little monkeys shriek and dangle by their tales from the branches of trees. Jewish huts in Goshen are covered with piles of ornately thatched leaves. Grandiose monuments erected by hordes of ceaselessly laboring Jewish slaves, their brows drenched with sweat and their backs embedded with the innumerable scars of Egyptian lashes, surround the vista of Rameses I royal domain. This is no exaggeration: the ''Prince of Egypt'' is so detailed one can literally smell the camels and the sun-drenched mud, the incense on the altars of the priests and the ''salt of the sweat'' on the brow of those unfortunate slaves. This movie, endlessly compelling and entertaining, is, in a word, nothing short of fascinating.",1153440000,3,3741,5.040387722132472

55663,5,078322995X,"I am a grown man and I still get a little choked up when I watch this movie.  It is animated film the way they should be done but seldom are in this digital age. It has all the necessary ingredients for an animated classic, good animation, a classic story, and beautiful, even haunting music.

The animation looks hand drawn, though at least some digital techniques were used, particularly in the very dynamic action sequences.  But it works.  Some scenes look almost cinematic in their detail.  The filmmakers mimic live action photography very well. Look for the artificial sun glaring on the camera lens that does not exist.

As for the story, well a story that has been around for three thousand years will certainly stand the test of time.  If you are familiar with the Exodus story from the Bible then you may notice that significant license was taken when translating it to film, a fact the filmmakers acknowledge from the opening.  Nonetheless story is powerful and poignant. The characters are portrayed realistically, complete with inner conflict and the uncertainties that plague us all. Even the traditionally evil pharaoh is not truly evil.  He has a motivation to act the way he does.

For those who may not know what type of film this is I issue a warning.  This is a musical in a very traditional sense. If you don't like musicals you may not like this movie.  Having said that however, I found the songs to be catchy and the lyrics to be poetic. Particularly touching was the song of Jethro, well performed by Danny Glover, and the Exodus sequence, which is the one that gets me every time.

The film does have a few sequences that may be frightening to very young children, particularly the final plague inflicted on Egypt.  They are not so intense as to make one keep the kids from watching but may warrant a little parental explanation, so watch the movie with them.

The DVD also has some extras that the adults might find interesting, good commentary and some ""making of"" features.  I found the multilanguage presentation of the song ""When you believe"" fascinating.  In it the exodus sequence is replayed while the seamlessly dubbed voices shift between many of the languages in which the film was released.

I need not say much more. As of this time almost three hundred reviews have already been written on this film.  Read them and you will get some different perspectives.",1151539200,6,2398,4.721153846153846
55664,5,078322995X,"The story of Moses is a compelling one.  ""The Prince of Egypt"" manages to meld that story into a very easily digested tale for the whole family.  Though some liberties are taken, ""Prince"" keeps the basic elements of this wonderful tale intact.  The only truly noteworthy changes are that Moses confronts Pharoah instead of his biological brother, Aaron, doing most of the talking and Moses and Ramses are raised as brothers by the Pharoah.  In the Bible, Moses is raised by Pharoah's daughter, and Aaron plays a larger role in the overall story, doing most of the speaking to Pharoh as a representative of Moses.

With those minor details out of the way, ""Prince of Egypt"" is one of the best films around for the entire family to watch.  It begins with the finding of Moses on the Nile River by Pharoah's wife, then shows him grow up as royalty in Egypt.  He and his brother, Ramses, pretty much have full run of the roost.  They get into plenty of trouble with each other, and their chariot race sequence is one of the best ""chase"" scenes in cinematic history.  When Moses finds out that he is Hebrew, and that most of his people are slaves to Pharoah, he begins to notice the horrible things happening to his people.  He accidentally kills one of Pharoah's guards when he attempts to protect one of the slaves, and, upset, he leaves his home in search of himself.  God reveals to him that he is to lead his people out of Egypt, and he must go and tell Pharoah (who, by now, is Ramses) to, ""let my people go.""

The tale then takes us through the plagues that wreak havoc on Egypt as long as Pharoah refuses to free the Hebrews.  The final plague, and definitely the most chilling, is the Passover.  This, for those uninformed, is the time when the Angel of Death comes down into Egypt and takes the life of the first born children in every home that is not painted by the blood of a lamb on the door.  This sequence was very moving, and the worst part is when the actual Passover has been completed, and the unbelieving families realize what has happened.  The finale, the epic parting of the Red Sea, is just as, if not more, moving than the same event in ""The Ten Commandments.""  It ties the characters of Moses and Ramses together in a most painful way.  Moses and Ramses share a great love for each other as brothers, but neither can deny their true calling in life.  The final moments showing Ramses on the banks of the Red Sea are very moving, and almost brought me to tears.

I've rarely seen an animated feature in which the voice actors have done such a grand job.  Val Kilmer is wonderful as Moses, making you feel the pain and joy in his voice.  Ralph Fiennes portrays Ramses with plenty of regal flare, but there is a constant hint of grief in his voice.  Danny Glover, , Sandra Bullock, Michelle Pfeiffer and Patrick Stewart are amazing in their respective roles of Jethro, Miriam, Tzipporah, and Seti.  Steve Martin and Martin Short are hilariously devious as Pharoah's high priests intent on proving that their gods are much more powerful than Moses' God.  The standout of this group, however, is Jeff Goldblum as Aaron.  In my opinion, his performance in this limited role is one of the best voice acted roles I've ever witnessed.  His character made the film for me, and, other than Ramses, had a strong effect on me as I watched the film unfurl.

The animation in this flick is on par with Disney's giant animated flicks of the last couple of decades, namely ""The Lion King.""  The music is wonderful as well.

In all, this is simply one of the best animated stories ever.  I place it well above plenty of Disney's top films, and feel that it deserves much more respect than it has ever received.  Well done, SKG, this is a premier piece of animated work.",1150934400,34,3773,4.478770131771596

55666,4,078322995X,"I saw The Prince of Egypt the year it was released, and rewatched a few days ago to freshen my memory of what happened in that particular telling of the exodus of Jews out of Egypt. I am much older now, and still, this movie impresses me. A lot of theatrical boundaries were broken down for the tale of Moses. I don't know about everyone else, but I end up watching The Ten Commamndments almost every year since my birth. Honestly, I think The Prince of Egypt is far more entertaining. Firstly, making the movie a musical possibly was the best way to go. Every song is thoroughly addictive and have their own distinctive style. They are empowering as well. I felt like crying a bit after hearing the closing song, There Could Be Miracles (or whatever the real name of the song is.) I also caught myself singing Playing With The Big Boys. Now, another the reason I like this movie is that one does not have to be religious to apreciate the cinematic experience The Prince of Egypt is. For people who abide by the bible, this is a wholesome movie. Some scenes may be too disturbing for children (the sores, the death, the other pestilence and plagues.) For me, the real money came when I saw the Red Sea sequence. It was so beautiful, I wished I could've been there. The only reason it gets four stars out of five for me, is that the rest of the story was not told. The worsse parts I mean. When Moses and the freed Jews had to wander in the desert for forty years, never reaching the Promised Land. I suppose the movie was to end on a light note, so they left that out. Perhaps it is better that way. We see Moses do his job.",1146614400,2,1624,4.275974025974026

I found it to be a very moving work, both from the story-perspective, with the transformation of Moses from idle prince-ling to committed, mature leader, and for the spiritual and moral values that it celebrates.  They touched the third rail of cinema here, but with such skill and care that it's made something truly extraordinary.

The story: the highest priority in the world is not material, but the preservation of Hope and Freedom for all, even when that freedom leads great uncertainty and hardship.  The film recognizes humanity as luminous beings, divinely gifted, with innate value which cannot be corralled or killed or enslaved with impunity.  And that Nature (i.e. the Creation) has a place for us, and is deeper and more beautiful and precious than it appears on the surface.

This is fundamental to the Judeo-Christian tradition.  They covered brave territory - the genocide of the Hebrew children, the Plagues, including he last, the death of the First Born Egyptians, surely the saddest and most mature moment in all of animated kid's movies..  But it works because it's a universal story which conveys complex values beautifully.

It's curious to note though, that when this was written the Hebrews viewed it as their God's victory over the other Egyptian gods..so they weren't yet Monotheistic.  And of course when they arrived in Canaan their first 30+ years there involved `cleansing' the land of the Canaanites, and later the Hittites and the Philistines etc..  So the world has been `full' since prehistoric times, and freedom always, always involves displacing others.. Modern religion, and by extension the filmmakers, were looking at an ancient text through a very modern perspective.

Still, they've made something truly wonderful here.  The soundtrack is witty and deeply moving and powerful, even Operatic in the best sense.  It stands as easily the best film of its type and among the greatest animated films ever made.  Thumbs Up!",1140393600,,2069,5.061946902654867

55674,5,078322995X,"Excellent. This movie has a rich story line, unforgettable animation, and a musical score unmatched by other animated films. This is a movie for ALMOST everyone, as smaller children could be frightened by the 10 plauges. There is no problem with religion either, whether you are a Hindu, Christian (like me), Jew, Muslim, or none of the above, I'll bet you will enjoy this movie.

True, the story was different than the Exodus from the Bible and the Torah, but not so far as to be a distraction for Christian and Jewish viewers. Some notable differences take the form of the ""brother"" storyline (Rameses being Moses' adopted brother and all the conflict between them later in the film) and a slight difference in one the the plauges (burning hail). These differences do not take away the movie experience in the least.

The score is incredible, especially ""Deliver Us"" and the chior work on ""The Plauges"". The one childish song is ""Playing with the Big Boys"", but its not enough to destroy a good image of ""The Prince"".

This is not an ordinary animated movie. It is extremely serious and thus, is a better movie. Too many animated movies try to hard to be funny, but ""Prince"" keeps the movie serious with a rare and well placed chuckle.

The animation is amazing especially the plagues, the burning bush, and of course, the famous parting of the Red Sea. This is easily the best animated film I've ever seen (and yes Lion King fans, I've seen that too).

I am a wiccan, a pantheist, a pagan. But regardless of my religion/beliefs, I still found this movie to absolutely extraoridnary!!!

 It did not bother me that is movie is about MOSES. Nor did it upset me when in the movie they spoke about a single god, the true god, the god of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.

 My point is that this movie has something for everyone, no matter a person's gender, religion, sexuality, or ethnic background. Everyone will love this movie!!!",1107820800,10,787,4.507042253521127
55676,5,078322995X,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was rather dramatic for a children's film, but a good way to teach children the story of Moses and the Exodus.  For the most part, I found it pretty accurate.  Some artistic license was of course taken, but the themes and ideas and major events seemed to be all there. I watched this movie as part of a Bible study, and afterwards we had a discussion about it; if you are concerned about any inaccuracies or ideas presented, then I recommend doing the same with your kids.

The animation was absolutely beautiful.  I particularly like Moses' dream, which is styled after Egyption drawings.  The colors and scenery were also brilliant throughout the entire film.  And the music was wonderful-- I believe Hans Zimmer was the composer...so if you enjoyed the music of Gladiator, you will like this score as well.  Only one song irked me: ""Playing with the Big Boys,"" which seemed cheesier than the rest of the movie and slightly out of place.

I admit, this movie is not for everyone.  It is not a typical happy animated film, and thus is likely not a good choice for young children.  But it is good for older children, particularly those who know the story of Moses.  It is deeper than other animated movies, and so many adults will enjoy it as well.

Overall, I found the film very well-done and full of rich details.  The only issues I can imagine people having with it are the few places where it strays from the story in the Bible, but as I said before, this opens the door to some good discussions, and I highly recommend giving it a try.",1106352000,2,1574,4.496478873239437

However, I feel that its handling of ""adoption"" was very poor & a young adopted child could read bad things into the situation & what is indirectly said about adoption.  When Moses realizes he was adopted, he sees his current reality as fake & wants to go back to his true identity of being Hebrew.  Granted...  there's a lot more going on....  obviously Pharoah is the bad guy & Moses was supposed to go lead the Hebrews...  But an adopted child might related to Moses as being adopted & feeling like he was living in a fake reality....  Moses even implies that his brother isn't *really* his brother, although he still considers him to be his brother in spirit...  and then Moses leaves and refers to Pharoah as the man he used to call father (i.e., before he knew better).  This part of the story is all contrived, as it is not in Scripture -- and it is very unfortunate that this is in there.

55678,5,078322995X,"This review is dedicated to the children of Israel from way back in the mists of time to the present day and the future.
 To little Miriam-seen here in the movie- crouching by the River Nile waiting to see what would happen to the basket where her baby brother Moses was sailing down the River Nile in.
Here the pretty little tyke sings the song of hope blessing her baby brother - sung by the talented young actress Eden Riegel
To the children of Israel today - all of them!

The dedication was inspired by the lovely voices of the blessed Israeli children who sung an exquisite melody in Hebrew during the part of the film where the Israelites where departing from Egypt-it were part of the song: ""When You Believe""
 This was perhaps the most touching and beautiful part of ""Prince of Egypt"".

The hardship of the Israelites whose life was embittered by their Egyptian oppressors is perfectly displayed here, and Moses life as a swashbuckling Egyptian Prince, and a close friend of the young Ramses is an interesting one.
The animation was amazing, both the people and the Egyptian landscape.

Particularly outstanding and memorable  scenes:

When the Pharaoh Seti's Egyptian storm troopers charge into the Israelite slave quarters to cease the first-born sons of every Jewish woman, and Yocheved (Ofra Haza) flees, with the baby Moses in her arms, accompanied by her small children Miriam and Aaron. Beautiful songs by the magnificent Ofra Haza , who was taken from us so young , and Eden Riegel

 Where Miriam (read with heartfelt sincerity by Sandra Bullock) tells Moses (Val Kilmer) that he is their brother, while a nervous Aaron (Jeff Goldblum) assures Moses that Miriam is not well and should be excused her impudence.

When Moses go's into the Temple where the whole sage unfolds through his eyes about what the Egyptians did to the Hebrew babies and what happened to the infant Moses himself, he confronts Pharaoh Seti ((Patrick Stewart) about the diabolical mass murder of the Israeli babies Seti replies: "" Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the common good'. The same evil refrain used by tyrants through the ages from Pharaoh Seti to Hadrian, Torquemada, Robespierre, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, the mass murderer Arafat,  Mugabe and every other bloodthirsty tyrannical monster ever.

Moses' sojourn with the family of Jethro in Midian, where he marries Tzipporah. The dancing and singing there was incredible. (...).

Where G-D appears in the blue translucent light of the burning bush and instructs Moses to lead the Israelites to freedom. : `I have indeed seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and I have heard its outcry because of its taskmasters, for I have known its sufferings. I shall descend to rescue it from the hand of Egypt and bring it from that land to a good land flowing with milk and honey.'

Moses confrontation with Pharaoh Rameses and the long struggle to free the People of Israel from Egyptian bondage, his struggle with Pharaoh's magicians (who provide some humor) , and finally the angel of death sparing the Hebrew children and slaying each Egyptian first born son. Leading to the most beautiful scene, the triumphant march of the Hebrew people to freedom, full of love and hope!",1097539200,,3248,4.871143375680581
55680,5,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt is easily one of my all-time favorite animated features (the other being The Lion King).  It is visually stunning, bringing ancient Egypt to life in a way that no other film even comes close.  However, the main strength of the film is to take an epic tale that defined a nation and make it relevant to viewers from all cultures everywhere.  In less capable hands, Moses might have come across as lifeless as a certain chief of the NRA and about as sympathetic as any number of fire and brimstone prophets found within the pages of the Bible.  But The Prince of Egypt turns him into a flesh and blood person, one who feels agony at having to unleash disease and destruction upon the Egyptians and their children in order to fulfil his duty to his people and his God.  It is the age old dilemma of whether to take action that is necessary yet appears to be morally ambiguous.  It is a theme that is as relevant to Hindus (re: Arjuna agonising before the Battle of Kurukshetra over having to fight and possibly kill his kinsmen in order to fulfil his duty as a warrior and to restore honour to his family in the Mahabharata) as it is to Christians, Hebrews and Muslims.  The amazing score by Hans Zimmer only adds to the already impressive qualities of this film.  The haunting voice of the late Ofra Haza in ""Deliver Us"" made me cry - one can almost feel the pain of the mother forced to abandon her baby to the elements.  ""The Burning Bush"" and ""The Red Sea"" augmented the film's visuals well, making one feel as if one is really in the presence of the Divine.

The graphics were not nearly as spectacular as they're said to be and the story felt almost ""choppy"". The characters lacked emotion in all the wrong places. I would think that if I saw my first born killed, I'd be a bit more upset than Rameses was. Or if water became blood right before my eyes, my jaw would drop at least a little.

But my biggest problem with the movie was the soundtrack. Each song was very poorly written. No catchy choruses, no really lively numbers, nothing. One of the best parts of seeing a good animated film is that colors, gravity and the laws of physics are not an obstacle. The artists can create whatever song and put it to whatever setting. The imagination of the songwriters and illustrators definitely fell short.

One song in particular, ""You're playing with the big boys now"" was the most dissapointing. The lyrics merely repeated the name of the title over and over again and I found that the animation for the number itself was scary and just disturbing. I wouldn't let my children see if for fear of them having nightmares.

55682,5,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt is an excellently animated movie from Dreamworks, with
great storytelling and characters and usually very good music.  One doesn't
have to be religious to appreciate this movie (I'm not at all) -- the
emotions expressed by the characters are touching and the conflicts still
relevant.
As far as the animation in the movie goes, it is never less than excellent.
 Besides the special effects sections (the parting of the Red Sea being the
most ambitious and breathtaking of all), the character animation is superb.
 Each character is different and distinct, with this quality most noticable
when Moses is leading his people.  Every person walking behind him, most of
whom have only seconds of screen time, is unique.  As an animation
enthusiast, I appreciate this unwillingness to cut corners.  Also standout
in this production is the appropriate and effective combination of computer
graphics and traditional hand-drawn animation.  The dream/history sequence
that plays out in heiroglyphics on the palace wall is an effective use of
computer graphics in a 3-D setting that wouldn't work as well with
traditional animation, but the movie isn't overburdened by CG shortcuts
that just look fake.
The storytelling is also very well done.  I have read reviews that say it
changed the Bible story too much, but the movie flows well and has a good
sense of pacing.  Although I've never read the Bible story, the key points
I've heard of are included, and it seems the spirit of the story is intact.
The music, for the most part, is very good as well. ""River Lullabye"" and
""Through Heaven's Eyes"" are beautiful in that they have a more
middle-eastern feel to them, with a broader range of instruments than the
hit ""When you believe"", which in the ending credits is sung by divas Mariah
Carey and Whitney Houston.
One complaint: The Steve Martin/Martin Short scene is bad, bad, bad.  The
characters seem borrowed from too many Disney movies: as snide, snooty
henchmen with no character development, they are also way too modernized to
fit the theme of the story.  And their ""Playing With the Big Boys"" song is
terrible -- I just want to fast-forward through it.  That scene
notwithstanding, I think the movie is worth watching, for both children and

The graphics are not great, the songs are below average at best, the story ""more or less"" follows the biblical accounts, but worse, the characters are not attractive. I found Moses a reluctant participant, The Pharaoh a good guy and God a little sadistic (perhaps the authors should have emphasised what really went on with slavery, but then this is a film for kids). I shook my head a few times, wondering how such a wonderful and powerful historical account like Exodus could be rendered as lifeless and sadly my kids were just turned off by the story (as was I). My son's comment was ""it is so much better when you read it from the Bible"" and I have to agree.
I am still waiting for a good account of the Exodus to show up on film. Perhaps (instead of using their imagination to fill in the gaps) the writers should just follow the biblical text when making their movie... It has lasted and will last longer than their films will anyway.
Was the movie a good biblical account? Not bad, but not good either. The author took alot of his own inspiration when making the film. Is the movie good for kids? Perhaps some will like it...

55685,5,078322995X,"I am pleased to offer this review for what I consider to be one of the finest animated films of all time.  The review is partially in response to a rather malicious one offered by a reviewer known as trezku13.  I felt it necessary to rebut some of this person's inaccurate comments.
The movie puts a disclaimer at the beginning to inform the viewer that there are artistic and dramatic licenses taken with the story (a.k.a. whales in the Sea of Reeds).  You should be prepared for this when you watch it.  If you're watching this with the book of Exodus in your lap, you will see some differences in the two accounts.  These changes don't adulterate the message of the story and should not detract from the viewing experience.  Some differences to note are:
1) Seti's wife finding Moses rather than his daughter (Exodus 2:5),
2) The idea that Moses didn't know he was Hebrew and had no contact with his family (Exodus 2:7-11),
3) Moses' ""accidentally killing the Egyptian rather than deliberately killing him (Exodus 2:12),
4) Rameses pleading with Moses to stay in Egypt as opposed to Pharaoh seeking to kill him (Exodus 2:15),
5) Any idea of personal rivalry between Pharaoh and Moses,
6) Moses speaking by himself before Pharaoh instead of Aaron speaking for him (Exodus 4:14-16),
7) An exaggerated role for Zipporah when she is actually hardly mentioned.
These changes may seem unnecessary, however they do add intrigue to the narrative and, as before mentioned, do not in any way seriously alter the story.
The quality of the music does fall firmly into the realm of opinion.  However, as a person who holds a degree in music, and has performed and taught professionally for many years, my professional and personal opinion is that the music is quite wonderful.  The comments made by another reviewer make me wonder if this person actually watched this movie.  A comment about Steve Martin and Martin Short sounding least like their singing voices is the most absurd because they actually sang their own song.  The singing voices are very closely matched to the point that I didn't know until watching the credits that Danny Glover had not sung his own song.  A comment was also made about the firstborn sequence.  The plague of the firstborn sequence is why this movie gets a PG rating.  Focusing on the children dying rather than everyone involved makes sense, because that's the most shocking aspect of the final plague.  It is also noteworthy that this tragedy is brought upon Egypt because of Pharaoh's stubbornness, not God's lack of compassion.  A comment was also made about the two Egyptian soldiers dropping their staves and joining the Israelites.  I found this to be a subtle nuance that demonstrates the serious research that went into the making of this movie.  Exodus 9:20 makes it clear that there were Egyptians who feared the Hebrew God; and Exodus 12:38 records that many other people besides Hebrews participated in the exodus.  There is no inaccuracy in the movie's depiction.
The wonderful music, superb performances by the actors, and breath-taking visual presentation make this a landmark event in animated movies.  It has set a standard that all animated movies since have had to live up to.
A final note is in regard to the PG rating.  This movie is rated PG so as to encourage parents to watch this with their children and guide them through the movie's more mature themes.  Please consider this as I highly recommend this movie people of all ages.",1075766400,42,3480,4.824915824915825

55687,5,078322995X,"The Biblical story of Moses has become a spiritual cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. To adapt it to an animated motion picture presented an epic challenge to Dreamworks founders Steven Spielberg and Jeffery Katzenberg, which they have triumphed over very successfully. Disney's somewhat disappointing Hercules made movie fans look for a different angle of story-telling as it was becoming clear that they were tiring of the tried and true Disney hit formula. .
  After the Oscar-winning Pocahontas, the studios had not been to deliver its best (though I completely agree that The Hunchback Of Notre dame is one of the most underrated animated classics). Fox's Anastasia conquered a large number of hearts with its amazing character-depth and haunting tunes, but a box-office success of a larger proportion was required to dethrone Disney's monopoly. The Prince Of Egypt is easily the best non-Disney feature ever made (followed closely by Anastasia) and in every way, it as unique a classic as Beauty And The Beast or The Lion King. It is emotional, musical, captivating, and inspirational and has a profound moral meaning and beauty.
  The story remains mostly true to its Exodus origin. It varies from The Ten Commandments in exploring the relationships between the two brothers who are destined to be enemies. The strength of the movie lies in the strong emotional bonds it depicts between its characters, something which The Ten commandments failed to portray. The animation is lush and vibrant, blending both classic hand-drawn cels and Computer Generated Imagery. The backgrounds and visuals and breath-taking and even the CGI sequences such as ""The Parting of The Red Sea"" are to be marveled at. Dreamworks artists have adapted a new angular style of character sketching which looks refreshingly beautiful on the silver screen.
  Stephen Swartz's music is melodious and meaningful; from the spine-chilling ""Deliver Us"" to the soul-searching ""When You Believe"" which won the Oscar for the Best Song in 1998. (though I must say that I love Pfeiffer and Dworsky's version much more than Mariah Carrey and Whitney Houston's pop reprise). An astoundingly deep, sensitive and piercing score almost overrides the film's music; strongly highlighting the sentimental points with its rich orchestral appeal and Ofra Haza's tantalizing choral accompaniments. Nominated for an Academy Award, it deserved the Oscar for the Best Musical Score category (though I would personally have loved to see Goldsmith win his second Oscar for his incredible score of Mulan). Warbeck's score for Shakespeare In Love which eventually won, though appealing, pales before Zimmer's work or Goldsmith's masterpiece. Then again, I have noticed that Oscars go more by popularity than by talent. David Newman's nominated score from Anastasia was most definitely the Best among the Musical scores of 1997, although the Oscar favored The Full Monty, which could not possibly win in any other field where it had been nominated (owing to Titanic) and so walked away with a very undeserving award.
  The Prince Of Egypt utilizes a host of acclaimed on-screen actors and actresses;  comprising the voice talents of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Danny Glover, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, Sandra Bullock, Patrick Stewart, Martin Short, Helen Mirren and Steve Martin.  It is undoubtedly the most ambitious vocal cast ever assembled for an animated movie. All the actors bring the characters to life with striking warmth and depth.  Both Kilmer's as well as Fiennes' work are very praiseworthy.
  The DVD offers a excellent anamorphic 1.85:1 video transfer which looks very crisp and colorful. The Dolby digital 5.1 sound makes good use of surround, nicely highlighting the score and special effects. Dreamworks has also recently released a DTS version of the DVD in April, 2003 which is an improvised version of the earlier Dolby release. The special features provide an in-depth look at the making of the movie. Also included are two trailers, ""When You Believe"" multi-language reel, still galleries, interviews with the cast and a ""Basics of the Chariot Race"" CGI explanation segment.
  The Prince Of Egypt is nothing short of a masterpiece in animation history. The movie is geared more towards the mature audiences and those expecting fast pace fun-oriented stuff will not find it towards their taste. Young children may find some scenes a little disturbing, hence Dreamworks rated the movie a PG. So go enjoy Dreamworks' first animated motion picture, which is a classic to be cherished now and for generations",1066262400,6,4603,5.277701778385773

Two complaints.  1.  Though I admire the voice chracterizations of Ralph Finnes, Val Kilmer, Patrick Stewart, Could they not find any other actors of color to do the voice characterizations?  Danny Glover was the only one.  Why not Angela Basset or Halle Berry?  James Early Jones, Chi McPherson.  There were a host of actors to make a more ""diverse"" cast.  Well it took all these years to finally get the color right.  Perhaps next time the voices will match also.

It tells the story of Moses, and how he led the Israelites out of Egypt.  However, unlike the Ten Commandments (with Charlton Heston), this animation explores the close relationship between Moses and Rameses.  The footage here is fascinating.
The musical score is magnificent, and it mirrors and highs and lows of Moses' life - life in the royal palace in the lap of luxury; his confusion when he discovers his Hebrew origins; his anguish of being the reluctant foe of Rameses, and the awesome finale.  It's all here.  I especially love the film version of ""When You Believe"" - the part when the kids sing in Hebrew is magical.  I don't speak Hebrew, but it's sung with such innocence and conviction that it moves me anyway.

55696,5,078322995X,"This is one of the best made animated movies of all time. First off, the animation is amazing. It alone is reason to see this film. More importantly, it is an inspiring story regardless of your religious background (those worried about seeing a 90 minute propaganda film need not fear,) and is very respectful of the history and cultures it deals with.
I was most impressed by how accurately Egypt was portrayed (the middle eastern people in it actually have dark skin!) The film's creators really did their homework in making 19th dynasty Egypt and its surrounding tribes come to life. The use of traditional Jewish tunes in the music is a nice example of this.
Finally, this story makes the characters in Exodus very likeable and human. There is great character development and moral dilemmas. There are also no ""cutesy"" sidekicks or silly songs in this movie; the story is treated seriously which I appreciated greatly as well.
Besides the absence of cutesyness, the film is quite graphic in its depictions of slavery and death, so very small children might not like it, but I encourage all older children and adults to watch it, it is a wonderful film.",1026518400,,1156,4.785

55708,4,078322995X,"I am going to judge this movie in two parts.
(1) The animation in this movie is great. No corners cut on this movie. The voices matched their charactures perfectly. The music (With the exception of Mariah Carrey and Whitney Houston's 'When You Believe') was everything you could ever want in a movie soundtrack. To this part of the movie, I give a perfect 5.
(2) The story line for this movie was very disapointing. I was raise on the Jewish Torah and have been told the story of Moses since I was a young child. While the movie was, for the most part, bibically accurate, it did stray in some places. One of these places was that Moses was at least 40 years old, if not older, when he led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Another is the fact that Moses's mother was the daughter of Pharoah, NOT his wife.
I strongly disagree with the writers for trying to give this movie a more 'modern' feel. This story has been passed down for thousands of years, it's not something they thought up a few years ago. I believe that this terrible attempt to adapt the story of Moses for the 21st century destroyed what would have otherwise been a delightful movie. I give this part 2 stars.
I do recommend seeing this movie, but please keep in mind the true facts as you are watching this film.",1007769600,4,1272,4.348739495798319
55709,3,078322995X,"I have really mixed feelings about this movie.  On the one hand, many of the action scenes are totally awesome, such as the wedding dances around Jethro's campfire, the Burning Bush, the Exodus, the Splitting of the Sea.  And I liked the fact that Jewish music was used in places (even some Hebrew in Miriam's song at the sea.)  On the other hand, the attempt to make the story ""relevant"" through the use of contemporary language in the dialogue sounded lame to me, and will no doubt sound dated in a few years.  For example, when Pharoah says, ""I won't be the weak link,"" I almost expected to hear the game show theme.  I also thought that the sibling rivalry idea was overplayed.  There were obvious shades of Ben Hur and Masala here, too, right down to a reckless chariot race.  Ramses comes across as little more than a jerk with an insecurity complex who wants to get even with his brother.  In short, I disliked this film for the same reason that I dislike many recent Disney re-makes of the classics.  It takes too much poetic license with the story, trivializes serious themes, and tries to be too nicey-nice.  Definitely NOT a video I plan to buy.",1007337600,13,1156,4.514423076923077
55710,5,078322995X,"I'm going to offer a radically different point of view on this movie, because I believe a _lot_ of work got put into an aspect that other reviewers seem to be neglecting. Not to say that they are wrong, I just think that they are focusing overly on the obvious, and missing the incredible work put into the subtleties.
When I have heard the story of Moses, I have always thought there was a side missing. I've always wondered of Pharaohs role, wondered why he did what he did, what he felt of Moses, what he stood for. I wanted a story to be told that would see the world from _his_ point of view. After watching this movie, I have to laugh at how many people believe this to be simply a Moses story. After all, Pharaoh was _also_ a Prince of Egypt.
From the beginning, as we see Moses introduced to his (toddler) brother Ramses, we see the boys raised together. As Ramses and Moses race chariots together, we see the bonds of two brothers. When Ramses is raised up and honored by Pharaoh, his first action is to appoint his brother Moses chief architect. You can see how closely tied they are, but you also see how desperately Ramses longs to please his father. Eventually these two bonds will tear Ramses apart.
When Moses returns from wandering in the desert, the first action of Ramses, who has become Pharaoh, is to welcome his brother, and pardon him of all crimes he may have committed. Moses' first action is to return the ring symbolizing his position as Chief Architect (symbolizing much more than that to Ramses, I am sure), and command Pharaoh, in front of the entire court, to obey his God.
One cannot help but wonder: If Moses _asked_, would his brother not have given him anything? If Moses had not made it so public, would he have gotten his way? I find myself wishing Moses had given his brother a chance. It seems pride runs too strongly in them both.
It quickly grows clear (as Ramses uses the words he learned from his father ""I will not be the weak link!"") how trapped Ramses is by his father's expectations. Expectations that he can no longer ever wholly satisfy, now that his father is dead. Trapped, unable to bend, unwilling to change, you can see the tragedy inherent in this story.
And when Ramses' son dies, his desire for revenge makes sense. His desire to blame is not something you read, it is something you feel with your gut. What parent, remembering their child small, imagining him dead, cannot feel for Ramses, and understand his rage? Imagine his pain, losing his brother, his nation, and his son. The image of him, on the rocks at the edge of the Red sea, with the waves blocking him, having lost everything, crying out to his brother, will stay with me for a long long time.
Oh, and by the way: the story is several thousand years old. The facts are unclear. I think this was a truly insightful look into events that are usually portrayed much more simply, and as such, is immensely more interesting than a typical story. This may be disguised as a kid's movie, but it sure isn't!

55711,4,078322995X,"Not being much on cartoons in general, I wasn't all that hyped about this 'extravaganza' adaptation of the Moses story.
Nevertheless, it is highly entertaining, and the musical score delivers some good (though not always memorable) material. (""You're playing with the big boys now"" is my favorite song from the film, with its roll call of Egyptian gods!)
Highlights include the tomb figures coming alive on the temple wall during Prince Moses' dream sequence. This is delightful, and accurately renders the Egyptians' fondness for storytelling through art.
Also commendable is the film's portrayal of the grandeur of ancient Egypt by making everything much bigger than life. This technique adds an almost 3D quality to the imagery, and is highly effective.
On the downside, the parting of the Red (Reed) Sea is cool, but not spectacular. It is weakened by the 'aquarium' effect of swimming fish during the sequence. Also, as any good student of Egyptian history will notice, Ramases continues to wear his 'Horus braid' well past the early teen years when most Egyptian boys would have cut theirs. A minor complaint to be sure.
All in all, this adaptation of the Moses story works very well for younger teens, and introduces them to the story in a 'non-preachy' format. It is certainly a worthy effort, and features many high profile stars in voice and singing roles.
'Prince of Egypt' is action packed all the way, reasonably faithful to the basic story (though Ramases being the stepbrother of Moses is not nearly as certain as many experts might have you to believe), and does grow on you the more times it's watched.

However, Dreamworks SKG offers a better type of animation, and in my opinion, one whose plots are geared more toward adult audiences (while still remaining suitable for children). A prime example is The Prince of Egypt; entertaining, dramatic, emotional, and beautifully animated. After seeing it in theatres, I was immediately impressed, and bought it on DVD as soon as it was released. To my surprise, it was even better on DVD! Now, maybe that's just because my DVD home theatre system is awesome in it's own right - but the experience of watching The Prince of Egypt on DVD compares to no other movie viewing experience I have known. The colour is awesome - bright, rich, and vibrant. There is no distortion, and the clarity is superb. The sound is my main reason for loving this movie. With an unbelievable score by Hans Zimmer, and great songs throughout, this movie is worth watching again and again just to listen to. The DTS edition delivers the best sound quality I have heard to date on DVD. (Again, this is also thanks to my system). There are two scenes in the movie that give me goosebumps and tear-jerked eyes. The sound just seems to engulf you and carry you away - and you can feel the emotion that they are trying to project in the film (again, great job on Hans Zimmer's part). I have had my DVD system for almost one year now, and I have over 100 titles in my collection. Of all the movies I have to choose from, I watch this movie at least three times a week - It's just a feel good movie with great sound, picture, and an all-star cast of voices, including Sandra Bullock and Ralph Fiennes (two of my favourites). Since watching The Prince of Egypt, I became hooked on Dreamworks' animated features. The Road To El Dorado, my second favourite movie offers the same great sound quality, picture clarity (great colour contrast and saturation in this movie), and overall entertainment value. Dreamworks is also responsible for Joseph: King of Dreams, and the claymation feature, Chicken Run. Recently they produced Shrek - Available on DVD November 2!

But as a hard-to-please moviegoer, I can assert confidently that this film strikes the right note - both dramatically and musically.  The finely honed animation (what a clever way to use hieroglyphics) and the melodramatic musical score add a clamouring resonancy to the finished product, enabling this film to soar openly above most recent animated and non animated releases.
Unlike most biblical stories, this film leaves the viewer the option of individual interpretion of the events it depicts, and it is unpreachy in the extreme, rather it relies on potent entertainment value to grip our attention and keep us watching.  A human side to Moses is revealed, from his serenity as a supposed Prince Of Egypt, his exile in the desert, his appointment as a Prophet of God, his conflict with Pharaoh, to his deliverance of the Hebrew people from centuries of slavery.  This is not just a movie for Christians; it is a movie for the world.  By the people and for the people, the story of Moses as portrayed in ""The Prince Of Egypt"" is a movie and a story relevant to all religions - for it demonstrates that upon the strength that the power of faith, which is the essential ingredient in every religious creed, life altering miracles can indeed be produced, and that those with strong faith can triumph even over impossible adversity.

55732,5,078322995X,"This Enthralling and memorable story told in Exodus is brought to the screen in amazing detail and unparalleled animation. The disclaimer at the beginning of the movie explains the fact that this is based on the story in Exodus.

The main events were portrayed as accurately as I remember them from the Bible story. While many events were added to the story line to make it flow smoothly, they did not detract from the accuracy of the ""parting of the Red Sea"" and the main story of freeing the slaves from a 430 year bondage in the land of Egypt.

Through various miracles and plagues, Moses is able to gain the attention of the pharaoh and is sent by God to set his people free. When you realize your place in life, you must follow your destiny. Moses is forced to choose between the life he knows as a prince in Egypt and the life of his people, the Hebrews.

Overall, this was a great way to get children interested in reading the real story. I felt this movie made Moses more human and we could sense his internal struggle as he turned against his past and took hold of the future to lead God's chosen people to freedom. The score is hopeful and hauntingly beautiful with a Hebrew flair.

For once it actually seemed God was being honored and evil was looked down on. For that alone I say this film is worth owning! The story teaches about pride and how it can destroy you and others. The emphasis was on freedom and the fair treatment of all human beings. That it is wrong to murder another human or to enslave them.

The scenes of the Egyptians taking the children from the Hebrews could be very disturbing to young children. That is what gives this movie a PG rating as far as I can tell. There is nothing graphic, but it could upset young children because babies are taken away from their mothers. So be forewarned.

The movie ends with Moses receiving The Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai. These were laws given by God as guidelines for daily living. They are still relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. If you want to research this story further, The New Open Bible Study Edition is an excellent choice and you will find the story at the beginning of Exodus. It will also give you more information on why Passover (when death passed over the houses on which the blood of a lamb was spread with a bunch of hyssop) is celebrated today all over the world.

DeMille introduced the world to the vivid elegance and powerful epic story of the opening events of the Exodus chapter in the Bible, bringing Moses to life in the most glorious telling of his story to date. Now come ""The Prince of Egypt,"" which tells the exact same story as ""The Ten Commandments,"" but does so on kids' and adults' terms alike, delighting its younger audience with song and brilliantly composed animation while giving its story a universal feel that will have an effect on teens and adults who look deep into the movie. To not call this movie an epic would be shortchanging it severely.
This film opens its gates with a musical number, as slaves in Egypt regale their turmoil as well as their hope that God will bring them to deliverance from the hands of their taskmasters. The plan to kill off all the firstborn is merely implied here: there is no chamber where women and their first-born babies go to die, neither is there a conversation explaining these actions. They are presented with a single baby's mother, whose song of hope for her son's success in life wills him down the river in a basket, where he is plucked out of the river by the Pharaoh's Queen, who names him Moses and raises him as her own. This all happens within the first ten minutes of the movie, but instead of seeming rushed, it tells us everything we need to know that is vital to our understanding of future events, without melodrama or lengthy twists.
Years later, Moses (voiced nicely by Val Kilmer), along with his ""brother"" Rameses (given a glorious treatment under Ralph Fiennes), have a strong relationship of brotherhood and friendship, so it is extremely difficult for Moses when he is set upon by his blood brother and sister (Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum), finally realizing the truth of his situation and fleeing from Egypt after taking the life of an abusive taskmaster. His wandering lead him to a small gathering in the desert, where he soon is married, meets God in the form of a vibrant bush, and is sent back to his past home in hopes that Pharaoh shall free his people from his clutches. Of course he doesn't, causing Moses to bring down on Egypt the ten plagues of God, ultimately leading to their release from captivity and their walk to freedom.
Like the 1956 classic, there are some flaws in accordance with the accounts stated in the Bible, for instance the close bonds between Rameses and Moses. The movie chooses to focus majorly on this aspect, which works extremely well for the story because when the time comes for them to pit themselves against one another, it is so much more difficult for them to do so because of the past they shared. This works for the movie, but seems a bit of a stretch in terms of accuracy. However, the movie tells us that this account is not based solely on the historical, and that dramatic license was taken during the making of this movie, so that lets us know right away we're not dealing with the exactly, fact-is-all-here story.
The story, on its own terms, is magnificent and spectacular, a marvel for the ages along the ranks of other epics and sagas that bring a true story to life with grandeur and grace. The movie oozes with ambition and no sense of fear, and we can sense this because of its boldness in how it handles the story. The most intensified of these is the brilliant animation used for the movie, whose use of colors and depth bring to life the suffocating atmosphere of the grand halls of the palace, while giving us such feelings as warmth, coldness and chills. The animation will simply take your breath away with its grand scale, leaving you awestruck and touched.
This story is a true marvel in terms of courage and emotion, and the plot brings out both of those feelings wonderfully. Moses' struggle to free his people is told with utmost perception and grace, bringing us into his own mind's emotions and feelings as we watch him do God's work. His interaction with the other characters keeps the story moving, and the relations between he and Rameses in the second half of the movie is powerful and intense. We know who is going to be the ultimate loser of their battle, but it's still interesting to watch the two of them battle things out. We pretty much know the entire story, but that doesn't stop us from taking it all in again.
The key aspect to bringing out the emotion of this movie is its music, which is composed of some of the most haunting chords and upbeat melodies of any soundtrack I've ever heard. With original songs from Stephen Schwartz, whose previous work includes many Disney classics, and score composer Hans Zimmer, every emotion of the movie has its own piece of music, while the songs sung by the characters and the theme ""When You Believe"" bring to life the power and the struggle of the characters as they flee from bondage. While there are too many to mention here, the voice talents used are truly wonderful, composed of big name stars and bringing their characters to life as vibrantly as the animation does the setting.
""The Prince of Egypt"" is an intense and glorious movie experience for the senses and the mind, taking us on one of history's most perilous and rewarding journey into a struggle for freedom and strength. The film's integrity and masterful storytelling capability make it pleasurable for adults and children alike, while keeping itself in line with its epic scope and scale.",985651200,9,5427,4.642411642411642

55736,4,078322995X,"Animation took a big step forward on December 18, 1998, when ""The Prince of Egypt"" was released in theaters. It is simply the best american animation you'll see. The special effects are great, the story was well-written (though incredibly unaccurate, more on that later...), the music was Oscar worthy.
The story - The Prince of Egypt was very inaccurate in some respects, but this was mostly due for the sake of children (though this isn't a kid's movie in the Disney sense). The message of the story, the struggle of Moses to get his people out of Egypt, the grandeur of God (great depiction of God, those were the best scenes)...that's what counts. You can forgive historical inaccuracy in this one, specially since even in the Bible there are some obscure facts about what happened. Basically, the story has Moses surviving the Pharaohs massacre of hebrew male children (the hebrew population was more than twice the egyptian population, this was pharaoh's version of population control, since he feared the hebrew would end up overtaking the empire). Moses ends up on the Palace, the pharaoh's wife (I'm not sure about this, but I think the Bible said it was the daughter, not wife) takes him and raises him as his own. So, Moses never knew he was a hebrew, grew up loving his brother Rameses, who would wind up being his enemy. The story focuses on the love of these two ""brothers"" (another inaccuracy, but enough of that) and how both end up on different sides due to their respective responsabilities.
The music - Zimmer should've won an Oscar for his score. The music is perfect, specially ""The Burning Bush"".
The DVD - it has great extras. Good ""making of"" featurette; great ""When you believe"" video, where you can listen to all the language versions of the movie, the transition from one language to another being perfect; ""focus on technical effects"", which is interesting; ""chariot race"", a look at how this scenes came up; the two trailers; very good commentary by directors Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells, and Steve Hickner; cast and crew bios; photo stills and sketches; 2000 preview of ""The Road to El Dorado"", and ""Chicken Run""; production notes.

55748,5,078322995X,"The first time I saw POE, I was critical of the fact that Moses didn't age in the movie and that he was Pharoh's son and not grandson according to the Biblical account.  The second time I saw it, however, I opened my heart to what the movie could teach me.  In doing so, I became aware of something that really tugged at my heart and soul.  When Moses learned his true heritage and what 'the man I once called Father' had done to his people, it was hard for him to leave his brother and his home.  For the first time I was made aware of how hard it must have been for Moses to return to the palace and carry out the task God gave him to do.  Not just telling Pharoh what God had said, but later seeing Pharoh grieving from the loss of his son due to the plaque and the Egyptian army die in the Red Sea.  Tears filled my eyes when Moses stood by the Red Sea afterwards and bid farewell to his brother.  When this film came out on VHS, I quickly bought it.  After we obtained our DVD player, this became one of the first movies I purchased.  The special additions on the DVD about the making of the movie adds even greater value.

55751,4,078322995X,"In addition to being a beautifully made film, ""The Prince of Egypt"" stands as an excellent example of how to make religious subject matter entertaining without being preachy. It's also very much an adult film, and that's OK by me; it's about time us adults had a animated film we didn't have to suffer through.
This film bucks the trend of frankly religious films (""The Omega Code,"" ""Left Behind,"" etc.) that are little more than shills for a narrow religious viewpoint; indeed, ""The Prince of Egypt"" should be quite an experience for a viewer of ANY faith, even if it interprets the Old Testament a little loosely (which, to the producers' credit, is explained before the opening credits).
The main strength of ""The Prince of Egypt"" should be evident to anyone who watches the first two minutes of it: the animation is absolutely exquisite, and has marvelous depth. The film stands right up in this respect with any of Disney's best, which is no surprise; the film's producer, Jeffrey Katzenberg, is credited with prodding Disney to make classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid.""
""The Prince of Egypt"" also scores with a nuanced, beautifully layered plot that goes way beyond the typical kiddie-animation level (and makes it an iffy kiddie film - a tradeoff I support), excellent songs from Stephen Schwartz, and some of the strongest voicing I've ever seen in an animated film.
One of the great delights of this film is the relationship between Moses (Val Kilmer) and his would-be brother Ramsses (Ralph Fiennes). It would have been easy to make both characters little more than caricatures of good and evil, but instead we get inside their close, loving relationship and see each man's motivations; for Moses, it's guilt over his adopted family's treatment of Jews, while Ramsses acts out of a strong, if misguided, sense of duty to his country. Each man does what he must, even if it means breaking each other's heart, and in the end, that's exactly what happens.
That the inevitable climax is played more for tragedy than an easy ""I'm right, you're wrong"" payoff, in my opinion, evidence of a serious dramatic intelligence and an abiding faith in the intelligence of the viewer. No animated film I've seen even begins to approach this level of nuance and complexity.
Of course, it's this complexity that makes ""The Prince of Egypt"" a poor entertainment for young kids; it's not overly violent, and has no inappropriate sexual content or language, but without talking animals and cutesy songs, this film simply won't appeal much to the kiddies for more than 10 minutes at a time.
Personally, I think some of these themes are a bit too heavy for a child under eight or so (try explaining why God killed Pharoah's little boy to your four-year-old, as I had to, and you'll understand); in the end, it's up to you.
Overall, though, ""The Prince of Egypt"" is a real treasure of a film, and for those of us who believe in its story, it's a wonderful affirmation of the cornerstone of our faith. That ""The Prince of Egypt"" can do that without being preachy or self-righteous makes it that much better a film.
Bravo!

The story is about Moses,  right from the time his mother out him out on the Nile right to the  delivery of the Commandments. It focuses on relationships- especially  between Moses and his brother Remeses, the Pharaoh- and the transformation  of Moses' character from a fun loving reckless young Egyptian prince to a  responsible, wise and strong man who still has uncertainties but puts his  faith in God.
The movie is one of the few movies that has stayed true to  the original piece of work. Unlike Disney, Dreamcast used a different  technique to draw the motion picture, and the buildings, people and  landscape look exactly like what their supposed to: exotic, stark yet rich  in vibrancy.
It tries to stay as original as possible, so much so, that  parts of the songs are even sung in Hebrew- one also with children! These  songs are completely captivating. They moved me to tears, and made the  movie Original, with a capital 'O'.

55795,4,078322995X,"An unlikely but inspired choice for an animated feature. While the animation and direction do not in themselves break new ground, this film is best viewed as an Old Testament epic which just happens to be a cartoon. It  makes happily few concessions to the under-twelve crowd (e.g. the chariot  race) and remains faithful - literally - to the source.  As you'd hope in a  high budget animated feature, the voice casting is good.
For me, the best  moment is the very final scene - which puts on screen quotes from the Old  Testament, New Testament, and the Koran, driving home the message that this  is a story for all faiths.",951868800,,625,4.576576576576577

Notice, in particular, the life-like Nile River and Red Sea at the beginning and end of the picture. The chariot race that opens the  movie is thrilling and the parting of the Red Sea is breath taking.  Frankly, I hesitated to see this because I believed that it would just be  ""The Ten Commandments"" re-visited. However, the creators decided to focus  on how the God's edict to ""Let my people go"" would effect the relationship  of the two brothers--Rameses and Moses.  This point of view permits the  audience to have a strong attachment to both characters and the things that  happen to them. Another surprise is that the creators did not tone down or  ""Hollywoodize"" the religious aspects of the story. They realized that the  great power of this story is its spiritual element. The DVD ""extras"" make  it well worth the price. In particular, I found the comparison drawings  showing the creation of the chariot race to be particularly compelling. The  music and songs perfectly compliment the action and are never distracting.  Clearly, Disney is not the only studio that can create a great animated  film.",951868800,92,1198,4.770731707317073

55803,4,078322995X,"In many ways, the Prince of Egypt is an atypical animated musical.  It's longer than the average animated musical (almost two hours), it emphasizes the dramatic content of the story with little room for comic relief, and  (very atypically) sticks to the original story!  A few points are sheer  imagination, but the Biblical story is all there.  Harsh parts of the story  are not explained away or avoided.  Moses kills a man and must face the  reality of his crime (mind you, it doesn't take him very long to get over  it, but the thought's still there.)  The God that liberates also kills.  Moses' discovery of his past is the most appealing part of the movie, told  in part through the stylized Egyptian art instead of ""live  action"" animation.  For the most part, the viewer feels a genuine  connection to Moses as a real, live, human being.  Occasionally the  connection is lost, and it seems that Moses is only ""reading  lines.""  The concern for Moses the man is the strongest part of The  Prince of Egypt.  I find it refreshing that the focus of the movie is the  relationship between siblings, and not the love interest.  Although Aaron  receives little time in the limelight, Moses' sister Miriam becomes his  surrogate mother and inspiration.  And for once, the Pharoah is treated as  an actual human being instead of an evil villain!  As a whole, the music  compliments the emotional and artistic intent of the movie perfectly.  You  won't find yourself whistling these tunes, but when put in context, they  send a powerful message.  The images in the movie are beautiful.  Watch  this movie for the parting of the Red Sea, if nothing else.  The movie is a  bit long, and the high priests (meant as comic relief) are more annoying  than funny.  Still, the potentially sensitive subject is treated with great  care.  Well done.",947462400,4,1837,4.741214057507987

I thought  it was going to be accessible to everyone (like a certain famous animation  company) but I found myself hating it more and more because of the amount  of religion being forced down my throat. If you've never read the bible or,  like myself, don't care about the bible, don't expect to enjoy this film.  The animators seem unable to judge when to use CG and when to use  traditional techniques. For instance there is a scene in the Pharoah's  palace with large marble pillars (much like the ones in the Sultan's palace  in Aladdin) yet they are as flat as cardboard. Elsewhere in the movie I got  the impression that the animators had forgot how to draw without the aid of  computers. On to the casting, which was truly criminal. Almost all of the  Egyptians were cast as British actors (Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart etc.)  and the Hebrews cast as American's. Is all hope lost for Hollywood? Plus,  how can anyone cast Martin Short and Steve Martin together without  injecting their parts with at least some comedy (and I don't mean a jar of  water falling on someone's head). Truly a bizarre choice of casting. Now I  come to the movie's only good point: the soundtrack. This is truly an epic  soundtrack. Hans Zimmer delivers as well as he did in the Lion King and  Stephen Schwartz equals his effort from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. This  is a soundtrack that has to be heard to be believed.

This retelling of how Moses  and his brother Rameses, the Prince of Egypt, how driven apart by their  beliefs and true heritages.  Moses leaves Egypt, and his past, to join his  real family--the Hebrews.  When the burning bush in a cave starts talking,  Moses starts walking, and right back to Egypt to free his people. The story  behind the story:  Well, I've read Exodus, and I've been read to from  Exodus, and I know this story pretty well.  Although before the opening  credits said Historical and Artistical Liscenses existed for the film, I  was dissapointed.  There were essential parts taken out to ""better portray  the story.""

55861,5,078322995X,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies that I've ever seen in my entire life. I left the movie with tears streaming down my face. And it is one of the best 9 movies that I have ever seen in my 29 years of life.  I've seen this movie at least 18 times on the big screen and did not mind  shelling out the money to see it each time.  Along with my multiple  viewings I even went so far as to write out the film transcript (if anyone  reading this wants it feel free to contact me).  As spectacular as the  animation was that was not what moved me about this movie.  In these days  of creampuff movies it was so nice to see a film with a very good plot and  character development.  Rameses and Moses were so well drawn. Even though  Rameses was a villain he wasn't the usual one dimensional one portrayed in  films.  He does a deplorable thing by keeping the Hebrews in bondage.  But  he does so because he is too proud to be seen as a failure and as the weak  link especially considering the long and prestigious footsteps he has to  follow. Many of us can relate to that.  As for Moses he isn't the fearless  leader  that the makers could have made him out to be. He is reluctant at  first to go and face Pharoah  and instead adopting a  Smug attitude when  the Egyptians are suffering. He feels hurt and compassion  because Egypt  once was his home and these were his people. He even breaks down in tears  after his brothers son dies. This makes him more of a human being and the  type of character most of us can relate to.  Normally whenever I see a  Biblical adaptation for  the screen it is nothing but a mockery but this  time the makers of the film were respectful to the three faiths for whom  this film is so dear.  In a bit of politcal correctness I was finally happy  to see that someone realised that Egypt is NOT in Europe and the hues of  the characters reflect this. In response to the claims by some that there  was nothing to learn from this movie outside of the Bible. I offer this  strenuous objection.  I learned  A LOT from this film.  I learned that  having character and integrity  is the most important thing of all.  I  could not help but admire the way that Moses not only once, but twice  walked away from a comfortable life because it was  the right thing to do.  He could have remained in Egypt after he killed the guard.  His father and  brother would have forgiven him.  But because he could no longer remain  blind to the injustice that was going on around him he left. He also did  not have to leave Midian and follow Gods urging to liberate his people.  He  could have stayed exactly where he was. As a Christian I was reminded of  how God has delivered me from misery and despair.  I was also reminded of  how as a woman of African descent  God has delivered my people out of  bondage. I have a big apology to make, when I first saw a poster  for this  movie I assumed that POE was simply a thinly veiled attempt of two ""groups""  to go at each others throats in a film. But after I saw the film my opinion  immediately changed.  This is a universal story which can be applied to  people all over the globe in any time the present, the past and the future.  This is because human nature does not change, we will always have a need  to feel superior to some other group and feel that it is our ""right"" to put  them down and mistreat them. Look around the world and we still see one  ethnic group acting cruelly towards another because they think that it is  their right to do so.  One does not even have to look around the globe just  look around you and see how we treat each other.  Rudeness and un-civilty  may not be the same as keeping people in bondage, but like slavery it too  helps to crush the human spirit. This is so wrong.  This is one of the  (many) lessons I learned from seeing the Prince of Egypt.  We must view and  treat others with respect and dignity no matter how better we feel we are  than they are. This is a terrific movie! Which I believe Believer and  Non-believer will enjoy tremendously.  I am on my knees  as a Christian,  an artist and a patron of films to Dreamworks for putting out such a high  quality film (for those who moan about techniqualities in animation should  get a grip 99% of the viewing public would not know the difference).  Though I seriously think that it really is not suitable for Children under  12 years old.  Much of the significance is very heavy and may fly over the  heads young ones (which is why I think that the movie did not make as much  money as it should have.  My only  fault---it's too short!!",937785600,6,4602,4.193548387096774
55862,5,078322995X,"For those who give this film only one star, there is obviously something missing from your lives. Today one can't take your child to see a film without those perverted writers and directors having to dirty up the film  with trashy sex and all-out cussing up a storm. This film is one of those  rarities where a child will be entertained as well as taught a poignant  lesson about humanity and faith. For several years now the story of Moses  has been the sole heart of my desire to become a Christian, second of  course to what Jesus did for us on the cross. When I saw Cecil B. De  Mille's grand 1956 blockbuster ""The Ten Commandments"" I was  awestruck by what I saw. Then it just seemed for several years that no  producer wanted to tell a Biblical story from the Bible itself. Mind you  Robert Duvall did an outstanding job with his inspiring film ""The  Apostle,"" and it just seems that in this day and time of life on earth  films like this need to be made more and more rather than more trash and  garbage. The story is NOT silly. No story from the Bible is silly, and  nothing about GOD is silly. Case closed on that subject. This film made me  cry and restored what made me a firm believer when I first saw ""The  Ten Commandments"" several years earlier. The animation is among the  best ever in all time, looking so realistic at points you easily forget  that this film is what so many call a cartoon. The ten plagues are  mesmerizingly brilliant and haunting. The awesome parting of the Red Sea  can be seen as one of the greatest achievements in the history of  animation. The water looks and even looks to feel real that you want to  reach for the screen to touch it. The emotional exodus sequence is tearful  and moving, seeing how over 400 years of torment and hardship are finally  cast away in their redemption to go to the promised land. But the one thing  that makes me shed tears over and over is the song ""When You  Believe."" When I heard it in the theater during the exodus scene my  eyes spilled over and had to restrain myself from a total breakdown. Every  word of the song is so true and so touching I screamed for sheer joy the  night it won the Oscar for Best Song. I play it each day over and over, as  it keeps me believing when things in life seem dreary and hopeless, so  tempting to just give up and crawl away into a pit of cowardice and  failure. That song obviously defines what those people were feeling over  3000 years ago when they were told that they could leave to go to the land  of milk and honey. It is perfect for anyone and anytime when it seems that  life has dealt you a cruel blow that knocks you out of touch with your  dreams. It picks you up with the renewed strength to keep going no matter  what and that YOU WILL gloriously triumph over whatever has tried to tear  you down. But this film is truly one of the greatest of 1998 and deserves a  place on all movie shelves in every home in the nation, and even the world,  for it is a story for the world to be told of over and over again for all  time. I can only hope and pray to see more films of this nature come out of  the movie industry rather than some of the dirty smut that so many seem to  get a sick pleasure out of watching. Those films wreck, destroy, and  demoralize society more and more. Films like this one restores, builds,  inspires, and teaches us and our loved ones, and is something we'll want  our future generations to see.",937612800,2,3447,4.235384615384615

For those who give this movie only 1 star you better look at it again.  This really reflects and is  close to the story in the Bible.

55878,5,078322995X,"I have already reviewed this movie, but I'd like to add a few things.  I have just read all of the other user reviews, and while I was thrilled to see that almost everyone gave it 5 stars, I was disappointed at some other  observations.  While the film does a great job of teaching morals and the  beauty in honesty, it IS NOT a Christian story and it never will be.  The  story takes place in ancient Jewish times, thousands of years before  Christianity was even thought of.  Please understand this and do not teach  your kids that this is a Christian movie.  They will be confused.  For  those that haven't seen it: please do... if you are religious, you can  witness a fabulous display of your beliefs on screen.  If you are not, like  me, you will appreciate beautiful animation, music, characters, and a truly  heartwarming story about human nature and the spirit of life.",937180800,,878,4.532051282051282
55879,3,078322995X,"The Prince of Egypt is a good film.  That is, it had excellent animation, characters of depth, a moving score, and manages to be very entertaining. As a Biblical or historic interpretation it is a miserable failure.  I cannot  believe those people who say that this is true to the story.  First, the  Pharaoh is wrong.  This is pretty contraversial in the history circle, but  the Pharaoh of the Exodus was NOT Ramses.  Second, Moses probably did not  know the Pharaoh of the Exodus so personally.  But that wouldn't make a  film.  And that minor error is forgivable.  The portrayal of Moses is not.  As soon as the man is called of God, he becomes rather wimpy.  He is filled  with indiscision and regret because of his close relationship with Ramses.  The character of Moses was not nearly strong enough in spirit.  Not to  mention that Moses was 80 years old at the time of the Exodus. Second, the  error of the queen fishing Moses out of the Nile is by no means minor.  The  whole scene was inaccurate.  The historical Moses had no need to  ""discover"" his roots.  His sister Mariam greeted the Pharaoh's  daughter personally and offered to find a nurse.  When Pharaoh's daughter  agreed, Mariam fetched her mother.  Therefore, Moses was NOT raised in  Pharoah's house; he was raised in his OWN Jewish home, under the covenant  teachings of his OWN parents!  He already knew who he was.  And every day  he saw his people in slavery, it burned him inside. All things considered,  DO see this film.  Don't take it as scripture.  It's not even close.  But  the blaring historical errors, though unignorable, are worth hearing the  phrase sung, ""Thus Saith the Lord!""  and the Hebrew children  singing ""Ashira la'adonai ki ga-oh ga-ah . . .""I will buy this  film.",936748800,9,1762,4.657894736842105
55880,5,078322995X,"I saw ""Prince of Egypt"" in the theater and plan to buy it on video, though I will wait for a letterbox version. I was awed by the power and emotional depth of the story, and its technical execution. It's so nice  to see an animated film that's truly appropriate for the whole family,  without resorting to cutesiness and broad humor as Disney so often does.  The film pulls no punches in its treatment of slavery and death, yet is  never explicit. The songs and score are quite good and often magnificent. I  am not Christian or Jewish (I'm an agnostic animist!) yet the power of  Moses' faith can inspire all of us who are unsure of our place in the  world, or who have to do something which may not be pleasant or easy. (If  only we all had something as obvious as a burning bush to show us the way!)",936230400,,802,4.230263157894737

The scenes are beautiful and the music takes my breath away. A few moments get me every time, especially the beginning as Moses' mother sends him down the river in hopes of saving his life. The music and ""camera work"" really show the emotion and desperation of the character.
