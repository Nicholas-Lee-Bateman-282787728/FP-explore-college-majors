8526279,2,B0089BSOOG,"All in all I was a bit disappointed, as the blu ray does not show what I really expected to see. The jellyfish depicted on the cover , which prompted me to buy it, simply doesn't appear in any of the episodes or  2 discs. There is, in my view, too  much repetition too. Only later did I find out that this series was uploaded to youtube. Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it.",1440115200,,377,4.013333333333334

8526282,5,B0089BSOOG,"Bob Ballard is a fascinating explorer - and this documentary is a compelling story of our Ocean - why it's so important, why we need to take to exploring it - why we need to protect it! Shared this with my 8 year old - ""very cool Dad!"" Also check out ""Drain the Ocean"" from NGC!",1370563200,3,278,3.982142857142857
8526283,3,B0089BSOOG,"thought this was similar to Blue Planet episode of submersible filming new underwater species in deep ocean that I saw on Animal Planet episode.  Mostly contains footage of shipwrecks, underwater vents, tube worms, about 3 min. footage of a new species of crabs that live in colonies around the underwater vents, and glimpses of underwater ocean floors.  Good if you are into exploration...not so good if you are looking for new underwater species and extensive footage focusing more on animals than on geography.  This is more geared towards geography, dicsovery and studies of the earth, etc.",1362700800,8,594,5.166666666666667
