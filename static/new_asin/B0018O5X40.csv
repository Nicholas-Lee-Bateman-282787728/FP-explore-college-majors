8270311,5,B0018O5X40,"Well-done. The reason for the escapes, and the inaction by the ""outside"" community in the face of eyewitness reports of the mass killings, left me sober.",1403481600,2,153,4.923076923076923
8270312,5,B0018O5X40,I was very pleased with my order.  My order exceeded my expectations.  My order will go great with my World War II DVD collection.  I think this DVD was informative.,1390780800,,165,4.433333333333334
8270313,5,B0018O5X40,"I find this to be one of the best Secrets of the Dead shows ever produced. While I do agree with one of the previous reviews that this documentary did leave you wanting more, I feel that is the purpose of a documentary. After watching this DVD and learning about what could have been, what actually was and the aftermath even today, you will want to do more research and discovery on Vrba and Wetzler. I have never been able to forget this poignant piece and plan to add it to my personal and library collection. I include this title in my Resource Guide to the Holocaust for Undergraduate Students without hesitation.
For the record, this is the true, non-fictionalized account of events associated with the film ""Schindler's List.""",1303603200,7,733,4.689922480620155
8270314,2,B0018O5X40,"My wife and I have been Holocaust readers for several years now, and have many documentaries within our library.

 This is a good documentary about the holocaust and the escape from Auschwitz, but the europe DVD copy is more thorough in its description
of the camp itself.

This American copy is CENSORED for the ""safety of our children"" and our
politically sensitive viewers.

 FYI Only.

8270315,3,B0018O5X40,"This documentary was about 2 men who escaped from Auschwitz and lived to inform others about the genocide going on there.  The reenactment scenes are filmed in black-and-white and I wonder if that were meant to copy ""Schindler's List.""
I thought this might be like the film ""Escape from Alcatraz"" where the focus is on the escape.  However, the escape is covered for 5 minutes or less.  This concerns the conditions in the camp and the aftermath of the escape more than the aforementioned items.
It is very difficult for me to watch anything having to do with Nazis or concentration camps.  I can deal with Titanic, but relatively modern tragedies are more difficult for me to handle.  So if you are squeamish about WWII and wish it never happened at all, you may be wary of seeing this.  If you are like me and have trouble processing things that are incredibly painful, you may not want to see this work.",1215129600,6,906,4.596273291925466
