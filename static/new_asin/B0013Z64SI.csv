8253669,5,B0013Z64SI,"Despite being somewhat dated, with a few, slightly superfluous soviet era patriotic speeches, this is an amazing film. Do not expect total military verisimilitude here. The battle scenes and the tactics employed by both side are somewhat naive. But this is not essentially a military film. It is a human film. It is a film about ordinary people caught up in the cataclysmic horror of war. As such, it succeeds wonderfully.

The cinematography, direction, and acting are all outstanding. This is, and should be considered to be, a classic film.

Please note that there is another, newer version, of this story, a Russian television series. That too is excellent, and even though it tells the same background story, it tells it so differently that both versions should be a part of any reasonable movie library.",1489968000,,809,4.985185185185185

8253672,5,B0013Z64SI,"This is a great WWII movie!  It shows the difference between the Germans and Russians and in a way illustrates some of the reasons why the Germans lost the war.  It is a story from a rural Russia (Karelia, i.e. land of lakes bordering Finland, north of Leningrad/Saint Petersburg) where a lone commander Sergeant Vaskov with a troop of female soldiers man a small post with anti-aircraft artillery.

The movie starts slow, introducing the five main female characters and their past.  Each of them has a unique personal story coming from various backgrounds of Russian society.  They have different motivations for being in the Red Army and initially some of them clash as they live on top of each other at their small post.  Life is pretty uneventful until one day two German paratroopers are spotted in their area.  Vaskov takes five girls with him and heads into the woods to figure out what the Germans are up to. The area is full of large lakes and swamps and knowing the area and shortcuts through the swamps gives the Russians advantage over Germans who trek around each lake and swamp for hours and days.  The Russians thus have time to prepare for the Germans in the most favorable spot and then sit and wait.  When the Germans show up the Russians count 16 of them, all heavily armed special forces troops heading north to blow up tracks used by supply trains.

Vaskov promptly sends one girl back through the swamp for reinforcements and tries to adjust his plans on confronting the Germans.  Besides being outnumbered and out skilled, the Russians' single shot rifles are no match for Germans' automatic machine guns.  The commander expects reinforcements to arrive about the time the Germans should get to the place he selected to confront them.  What he does not know is that the girl he sent back for reinforcements drowned in the swamp.  Thus when the Germans do arrive, it's a pretty hopeless battle for the Russians.

Yet, somehow like the war itself, the Germans manage to mismanage.  Partly due to their lack of knowledge of the terrain, partly due to underestimating the Russians and overestimating themselves and partly due to simple heroism of ordinary Russians, men or women alike.  While the Germans were willing to conquer and kill for Germany, the Russians were willing to fight and die for Russia.  And it was a myriad of such ultimate sacrifices on the part of ordinary Russians (to be fair, these were not always ""voluntary"") which went unmatched by the Germans that ultimately determined the outcome of the war on the Russian front.  It is this idea that is so beautifully depicted by the movie. At the end of the movie, when Vaskov captures the three remaining Germans he in a fit of anger, exhaustion and frustration starts mockingly shout at them; ""And you want to rule the world?  There were sixteen of you against me and five girls and you still could not get through!""

Also, it is when we lose someone we care about that we truly realize the impact of the war.  This is another idea that comes out of the movie so poignantly.  Many war movies aren't made like this -- main heroes typically make it through everything, even the toughest combat and only marginal characters and the bad guys on the other side die.  They make war seem like a game, perhaps a bit scary, but always with a positive outcome for the good guys.  Only real wars aren't like that.  Real wars cause pain and suffering indiscriminately.

There aren't many movies like this, it's a must see. I wholeheartedly recommend it.  The movie is in Russian with a bit of German.  Subtitles and dubbing are available for a number of languages including English.",1269993600,8,3658,4.716535433070866
