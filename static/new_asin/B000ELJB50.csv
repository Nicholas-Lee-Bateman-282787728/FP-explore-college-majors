8110893,4,B000ELJB50,Good demonstrations of skill with cards and gets right to the point.  On atleast one of the setups he doesn't explain the setup and instead refers to his other DVD and it was one of the more difficult ones.  I don't see why he couldn't have repeated the instructions since this DVD is mostly for beginners.,1327968000,,306,4.446428571428571
