This is not a big deal, but I feel people should be aware that the product is not as depicted. There are multiple listings of the Predator films on Amazon and I bought this one over the others because it was suppose to come with the dust jacket which I like the simple artwork it displays. Otherwise, I would have bought one of the other listings with artwork which a similar style of my copy of the Alien films just to be cohesive.

4250200,4,B0042ETJU2,"The Predator is one of the most intimidating aliens in the world of sci-fi -- a hulking, technologically superior big-game hunter who likes to take the skins of their victims. And ""Predator / Predator 2 / Predators"" is a solid way of being introduced and acquainted with the three movies that focus on these creatures -- expect lots of blood, dismemberment, and three very different environments where humans must outthink and outmaneuver alien threats.

""Predator"" features Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team heading out into the jungle to rescue an official held by insurgents. But when they get to the jungle, they find that something horrible is amiss -- the bodies of three Special Forces agents have been skinned and left hanging in the jungle, and it turns out to not be the work of the insurgents. Instead, an invisible force is stalking them through the jungle, picking off the commandos one by one -- and unless Dutch can figure out a way to outwit it, he'll be the final prize it takes.

""Predator 2"" takes us to the mean streets of 1990-era Los Angeles, during a sweltering heat wave and a small war between Jamaican and Columbian drug cartels. As the cops try to quell the violence, LAPD officer Harrison (Danny Glover) finds that the drug lords and their followers are being horribly killed by a mysterious assassin -- and as the Predator cuts a bloody swathe through Los Angeles, Harrison finds that a shadowy government agency is also following the alien.

""Predators"" sees several mercenaries, murderers, assassins and soldiers being parachuted into a remote jungle, full of human corpses, strange beasts and booby traps. Royce (Adrien Brody) quickly realizes that something is strange about this place, and soon they find that they're actually on an alien moon -- a hunting preserve where abducted predators are turned into prey for the Predators. And as the humans band together to try to stay alive, they find that the aliens pursuing them are also hunting their own kind.

Not counting the rancid stains known as the ""Alien Vs. Predator"" movies, the Predator trilogy is probably the most solid movie trilogy that isn't one continuing story. In fact, it works to the movie's advantage that -- except for the titular aliens -- there are no recurring characters who tie the different stories together, allowing the general feeling that these aliens can turn up in ANY hot, steamy environment, prowling in search of violent, well-trained individuals to hunt down.

And in fact, each movie has a distinct way of presenting itself -- ""Predator"" is a lean, small-scale thriller that relies on the primal, slightly feverish atmosphere of the jungle, while the sequel went for a ""concrete jungle"" full of shadowy nooks and grimy smoggy streets, and a much larger cast of characters for the Predator to pick-and-choose from. And while ""Predators"" is often regarded as derivative of the first movie, since it also takes place in a forested area, it's actually rather different -- the temperate alien setting gives it a nightmarishly remote quality, and the cast is made up of suspicious murderers and soldiers rather than a tight-knit team of commandos.

It also benefits from some rather good performances by the various lead actors -- Arnold Schwarzenegger made cinematic (and meme) history by flexing his biceps and shouting ""Get to da choppa!"", making a pretty charismatic commando. Danny Glover is the other end of the spectrum -- hard-nosed and low-voiced, he has a low-key energy that makes him a convincing cop, but not necessarily a thoroughly convincing alien fighter. Adrian Brody is a bit better, with his wiry, hyper-intense, Batman-voiced merc who becomes the unofficial leader of a rather unruly band of killers.

""Predator / Predator 2 / Predators"" is a good way to introduce yourself to the Predator universe -- while light on supplemental features, it's an entertaining trio of sci-fi/action movies with lots of skinned bodies and ripped-out spines.",1479772800,,4007,5.04380664652568

moved into their newest house,
and we watched it pretty much every time it was on.

I know every line, basically.

Predator 2 - my family and I saw in the theatre when it came out.
That movie was a part of my childhood too.
I drew the new predator mask while out to dinner
with my family afterward.

The only question I had going in was
how good is the 2010 movie.

I bought the blu-ray collection blind,
and we watched it the other day.

I have to say, I really LOVE the newest film.
That's all I'll say.

4250256,5,B0042ETJU2,"I have been waiting for all three of these films to be available together.  Predator is one of my all-time favorite films, either it or The Running Man would come on HBO every day when I was a kid.  I like the other two films, but don't love.  Because I love Predator so much, I almost bought the 1/2 Own The Moments, and buying the separate release of Predators.  But I would rather have had them in one package.  And sure enough, one day they added Predators to Own The Moments, and there were all 3 in one cheap and compact package.

I'm not a videophile.  I can't sit here and break down all that stuff, but they look great to me.  Predator is the ""Ultimate Hunter Edition"", which I only bring up because I know in the early days of the 1/2 Own The Moments, this was not the case.

As for the content of the films, I'm assuming everybody knows about Predator by now.  Predator 2 was kind of a let-down at the time, but it has grown on me over the years.  As a kid I wanted Arnie, and the jungle.  Danny Glover in a crime-torn LA was quite a departure.  But now I enjoy it quite a bit, particularly the ending.  Predators I was skeptical about, but I found it pretty entertaining.  The premise is a good one, the cast not-too-shabby, and it's a worth addition to the series I think.  People complained that they were trying too hard to be like the original, I call it getting back to the roots of the franchise.  Besides, the fact they strayed so far form the original was one of the biggest complaints about the second, then they get back to it in the third and THAT'S a complaint now.

Overall, Predator is the only film in the series I really love, so I would gladly pay a lower price to get them in an Own The Moments package than dish out for a fancy box set that will surely come out in the future.  I'm not sure I would really want to dish out a premium for a box set that only has one truly great film in it.  But a cheap little package with 1 great and 2 pretty good movies is right up my alley.",1406419200,8,2007,4.097435897435897

Part of the reason for buying this set for me was to have access to the digital copies. Granted, it is an international release, but it was being sold freely in the U.S.

Foxconnect directed me to ask Amazon for help; Amazon did not produce this product. At best, Amazon could offer a refund/return scenario, which would not be the point here. Foxconnect is basically not standing behind its product.

4250276,3,B0042ETJU2,"This is a 6-disc (3BD & 3DVD) release of 3 Predator films. Arnie stars in the first and best regarded Predator. The video and audio are good but not great (yet they are the best released to date). It is the best Predator collection available but a 3-hour retrospective documentary with the cast and crew would make it even better. Even with over 4 hours of supplements it can't compare to the Alien Anthology.

Skip the overrated Ultimate Hunter Edition of Predator. My only complaints are that the extras are light for a trilogy set and the digital copies cannot be redeemed in the US. The discs are region free but the digital copy codes are not region free so you have 3 extra discs. I rate the original film 5 stars but this release gets only 3 stars. It has managed to hold its value.",1377216000,17,2297,5.133689839572193
4250277,1,B0042ETJU2,the dvd would not play due to wrong region code. tried to send it back but it would cost more to send back then it did to purchase it so we decided to take our loss on this product. not happy about it. we need region code 1 not 2.,1376697600,,230,3.62
4250278,4,B0042ETJU2,"For this great price I got a wonderful collection, I would rate this item 5 stars if only the digital copy was available to use. The bad thing when I tried to download the digital copy, but a note said that the code should be redeemed by September 29th 2012 which means that the code is no longer valid.

4250287,5,B0042ETJU2,"Crisp, with nice image depth in BluRay, and breathtakingly spacious in DTS surround sound. The Extras and new commentary tracks are revealing, except perhaps for McTiernan's rather bored and distracted ramble on the first one.

4250289,2,B0042ETJU2,The DVDs are fine but the movies leave something to be desired.  The action is fun but don't try to follow the plot too closely.  The first one is the lamest since the plot developed during the first half is thrown away and never discussed again.,1353974400,2,246,4.326086956521739
4250290,5,B0042ETJU2,"I bought this set mainly because i had just purchased the Alien Anthology(import). I had seen Alien Vs Predator also but still did not see the first 2 Predator films. I stumbled across this trilogy and it had a beautiful price so i decided to pick it up. The first movie Predator staring Arnold Schwartzenegger was a pretty fun movie. Arnold leads his team of elite soldiers into a jungle for a rescue mission. needless to say it does not go as planned. The second Film was not nearly as fun in my opinion. Don't get me wrong though there is plenty of shooting and lots of awesome predator kills. however it turns out all the action in this movie didn't make it as desirable as the previous film. The third film is the second best watch although to some it may be the best one. full of great actors. but the story has something to be desired. If you read other reviews you may see that people are having problems with the Digital copies of these movies. This particular feature does not really do anything for me since i never watch movies in my laptop because its a piece of junk, if you are somebody who uses digital copies often when they are provided then you may want to skip this set. If you are someone like me and only watches their movies on a TV then i would highly suggest getting this. Overall the movies score a 4/5 the cover art is very cool and the digital copies don't really carry any weight to make me drop my overall score.",1346284800,8,1442,4.305147058823529
4250291,4,B0042ETJU2,"If you're looking at this item, odds are you already know whether or not you like these movies, so I'm not going to waste time talking about the artistic merit of them. While I enjoy them quite a bit, Predator is essentially 2 hours of Arnold screaming, Predator 2 is Danny Glover and Gary Busey chasing a Predator that's also maybe chasing them and oh man drug wars, and Predators is Adrian Brody trying to be Not Adrian Brody while things die horribly. These movies shouldn't be nearly as enjoyable as they are, really.

Anyways, the picture quality and audio quality is what you would want from a blu-ray collection. Everything looks quite nice, and the sounds, while not superb, do have some high points, such as the sheen of a sharp object being thrown.

My reason for purchasing this was to have a matching set to the Alien Anthology. While it has nothing on that in terms of the sheer volume of content, it is definitely a serviceable companion, albeit one that clearly had next to none of the love that AA had put into it.

As for the negatives, the digital copies that are included of all three films are troublesome. For one, they're practically advertised to you even though you've already purchased the product. Half of the back cover for each individual case is dedicated to the digital copy, and each case contains a second disc. Make sure you are strapped in, folks, because this might just blow your mind.

If you put the second disc into your computer, a window opens that lets you enter in the serial code for that films digital copy.

Of the 6 discs in this set, 3 of them are simply another layer of DRM. On the plus side, you now have three discs you can try to make a Predator Disc out of once you've redeemed all your digital copies.

The larger issue with the digital copy is that most people are going to try to redeem it through iTunes. Well, unless you live in the UK or Ireland, where this is originally sold, you can't. The discs are region free, but your codes won't be region free if you use them with iTunes. I went through Fox customer service and they were actually pretty easy about the whole thing. My suggestion is to redeem the code for the Windows Media Player copy, which IS region free, and use a program of your choice to convert it to a format that plays on your device of choice.

To be clear, this review is for the white set with the cover art depicting the sideshot of a Predator mask.",1343001600,47,2432,4.415178571428571
