8634463,1,B00000K3TD,"I was looking for a particular version of the movie ""Jack and the Beanstalk.""  I was checking the picture on the box.  I finally found one that matched the version I had (our tape broke) and ordered it.  The seller sent a different version (not the one pictured).  We did not care for this version because it was more of a narration of the story rather than the cartoon of it. It was not suitable for my deaf grandson.  Sellers should send the product pictured in their ad and not switch the product.",1331424000,,500,4.333333333333333
