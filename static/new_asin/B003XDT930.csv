8659046,5,B003XDT930,I love JYJ...all three of them are awesome....it was worth buying it and listening to their music and watching them perform....it was definitely way better than their Soul concert....Just wished that they had english sub on the parts they were having conversations....,1363996800,,268,5.404761904761905
