8350840,2,B0024R1CGS,"Fate must want to play some mean trick on me, as I have watched one movie that was horrible that had Vinnie Jones in it, and then unknowingly here he is again in the next in a movie worse than the last I saw him in.

This movies plot is set in Ireland, a student of bogs and his irritatingly mean for no reason pms driven chauffeur take a ride out into the country to scout some bog locations. However they end up writing off their automobile and head for the nearest house in the woods for help. By chance another 2 couples who happen to be out that way also get lost and end up in the same little cottage in the woods together, stranded, and no clue how to get back to civilization. Vinnie Jones playing a hunter named Hunter, oh how ironic, ends up showing up at his little cottage to find 6 strangers making themselves at home. What none of them know is a bog man had come back to life and is out for vengeance. Jason Voorhees sniffs out the teenagers having premarital sex... errr, sorry wrong movie, The Bog Man sniffs out these people who have a dirty secret related to the bog, and won't stop until he fulfills his quenching thirst for ... water! Will they survive Jason, I mean, Bog Man? Well, put it this way, if you see this film the same way I did, you won't care less who survives and who dies.

This flick had potential to be something decent. It is filmed well, the scenery is nice, the editing, score, acting by most of the actors and all that is fine.  Well, apart from daylight shining in through the cracks of the windows and wooden door when it's supposed to be night time, but apart from a few lighting issues here and there, they did a decent job... it's the script and story that drags this movie down.

Too many bad character developments for no reason. It just makes you wonder why someone is being such a B!%(# to everyone, and why the heck love interests are sparking while surrounded by death, all for nothing to pay off or be needed to tell what little story this thing has at all? It's just useless filler, and it adds nothing to this flick.

The film reminds me somehow of Dog Soldiers. However, Dog Soldiers is a much better film then this one here, however, I could see this one here as being some sort of bad attempt at a sequel to that film. Maybe if they super-imposed werewolves over this Uncle Fester looking Frankensteins monster thing, it might have been more believable somehow rathar then trying to by in to a story about a 2000 year old skeleton that has come back from the dead to kill and consume H20.

The ending could have been way better too. Such is the case with most of these flops.

I don't actually give the film 2 stars, it's more like 1.5. I got through it from start to finish, so it wasn't boring, but that still doesn't mean I ever want to see this ever again, or have anything good to say about any part of the movie at all. Even the gore effects where zero to none.",1386806400,2,2925,4.240574506283663

8350842,4,B0024R1CGS,"A comedy-horror film from Ireland.
  Mr. Hunter (Vinnie Jones) is on the hunt for a man-creature who speaks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eegah/dp/B00006SFIX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eegah</a>&nbsp;(1962). Hunter gets him, but their are more. Another man-creature bites his leg, but he cuts his hand off. He gives it back to the man-creature in the bog.
  These 2000-year old bodies are usually found in the bogs of Ireland and Denmark.
  Two construction men (Michael Collins, Paul Valentine) tell Miss Leary (Shelly Goldstein) that being bog land, the ground is too soft to build her houses on. They just found another mummified bog person. She doesn't care. She wants her land of real estate finished.
 Two women, Hannah (Amy Huberman) and Mallory (Olga Wehrly) are lost in the bog land and comes across an isolated house.
  Back at the construction site, the bog body begins to rejuvenate and new skin is formed as the body becomes alive. Now a muscular man-creature, (Adam Fogerty), but on the prey to kill. He needs fresh water.
  Miss Leary and Deano (Gavin Kelty), the taxi driver get stuck in the bog land and also come across the isolated house.
  Saiorse (Nora-Jane Noone) is a curator and David Wallace (Jason Barry) is an archealogist surveying the bog land and trying to find the lost kingdoms. as they are driving, the car hits a cow. Wondering around lost (you guessed it!) they also find the isolated house with the others.
  It's too late for any of them to start walking at this time of day, so they decide to stay the night.

 Really, thought this movie was silly, however, the film being from Ireland and I am an American who is Scotch-Irish by ancestry, I found the movie intriguing. The Irish have their legends too.
  Nice cinematography. Filmed in and around Dublin, Ireland.

Also known as: Assault of Darkness (2009), Bog Body (2009).

 I assume the midget circus clown is named ""Bobo"" and the actor is MJ Junior.

8350843,1,B0024R1CGS,"This low budget movie has plenty of beautiful scenery, but has a truly dopey villain in the supposed bog man who comes back to life for no apparent reason and starts killing people.

8350844,3,B0024R1CGS,"Well, it wasn't THAT bad. But not that good either. I just happen to like Vinnie Jones. Plus it's pretty cool to see the then, future WWE Champion Sheamus in something other than wrestling.",1293494400,3,189,4.588235294117647
8350845,3,B0024R1CGS,"If you loved watching bad movies with someone who looks like Toj Johnson, try this one out. The movie never really got scary, unless you are a midget clown. The bog monster isn't frightening and the shower scene was rated G.

I will say that the people in this movie tended to be have more character than in normal one star productions. The rude American was funny at times, calling the cab driver, ""McDuff, Gilligan and Darby O' Gill.""

There seems to be a lot of cows on the road in Ireland. More comedy than horror.",1278633600,2,518,4.385416666666667
8350846,1,B0024R1CGS,"This was a funny movie! At least a half dozen times, I laughed so hard, I could barely breathe. Three groups of two people end up in the same small cabin or shack. You have people talk about death stories, one taxi driver guy saying ""he was driving some girl somewhere, got mad because she didn't have the money, so he threw her out. Then 40 miles later, he hears this thumping. It was her, being dragged along the side of the car. he said, I guess her coat got stuck when he closed the door. HAH AHAH! How can you get your coat caught in the door, and not open the door or tell the driver, who by the way, is the one who opened the door to throw her out, to say, hey, don't go, I am caught.
The hunter saying, I tried to protect this guy, then at the next frame you see the flashback of him shooting the guy, HAHA HAHA!! FUNNY film. Oh my, what a funny show. You have to make fun of it. It's the only way to enjoy it. Many more funny moments.
Well worth the one dollar rental at Red Box.",1257811200,4,988,3.945
8350847,1,B0024R1CGS,This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time . Stay away from this low budget crap . It is no worth 1 star . Waste of money and time .,1257206400,2,148,3.138888888888889
8350848,2,B0024R1CGS,"This movie was made in Ireland with a very , very low budget. At least it was shot on film and the actors are all decent.  But it's budget is so small that the bog body drinks water and reforms into a huge guy who then kills people. Supposedly the victims all did terrible things and the bog wants them.  The bog people were usually sacrifice victims that were killed for various reasons.  the Celtic people did this from about 1,000 B.C. or so until around 200 A.D.  or so.  Some people think that they were from the same tribes , but I personally believe that most of them were from rival tribes usually.  In this movie a hunter is going around killing the risen bog people , only some of them are recent dead people , this is not explained and the whole idea of them out there is wasted because the movie is mainly about one ancient bog victim who is hunting the cast down.  One of which is a awful american woman who is nasty and the epitomy of the rude arrogant stereotype that some people see all Americans.  There are a few like her though and they could be any Nationality; they are just ruthless bosses.  Sadly we are  even denied seeing her get her punishment in any real detail.  The whole flick is mainly about the one bog person and his hunting of people.  It's just an ok movie at best , it could have been worse though. But it will leave zombie fans none too happy I fear as the dead look alive completely.",1245888000,3,1421,4.222222222222222
8350849,1,B0024R1CGS,"Let me tell you, this movie had to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. it was no ""bog body"" roaming around killing. It actually looked like Popeye the Sailor. My suggestion to all is to steer totally away from this Vinnie Jones flop. Pick up either The Condemned or The Midnight Meat Train instead. Way better movies. Sorry Vinnie it just plain sucked!!!!! This would have got a zero star rating if I could have done it.",1245715200,5,431,4.2682926829268295
