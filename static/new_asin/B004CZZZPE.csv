8424444,3,B004CZZZPE,"A story about older boys bullying slightly younger boys; and the slightly younger boys fighting back.

The boys in this film are too old to be charming as little boys fighting with another group of boys over use of a vacant lot.

We never see the vacant lot, or the boys playing in the vacant lot; thus, the value of the vacant lot is not impressed upon the audience, when the boys fight over it.

The film holds your attention; it is okay, but nothing clever or charming.

The film's moral that choosing war is foolish; is not impressive considering 5-years after this film was made; Hitler would force war upon peace-loving nations; showing we often have no choice. However, the film has another unintended, moral, which is compelling; the boys do not exploit an opportunity to tell a boy's father that his son has betrayed them, because the boy has already apologized to them, and has already received his consequences of being thrown out of the club. A lesson in forgiveness; a lesson against malicious-gossip and slander.

I saw this film for free on TV on TCM. I would have been disappointed if I had paid big money for it on DVD.

There is some slight humor in the film. One boy, a former ""Little Rascal / Our Gang"" member from the early Jackie Cooper era, is always beginning to eat a banana, but getting thwarted in enjoying his banana. The boy's military club has 15 officers and one private. The younger boys show some cleverness in their plan to defeat the older boys. However, there is not enough humor, cleverness, or charm, at a quick enough pace, to be good; rather than just fair / okay.",1369699200,,1604,4.552083333333333

8424446,5,B004CZZZPE,I have seen this movie many times. I even bought the book called The Paul Street Boys by Ferenc Molnar. I also bought this book through amazon.com. Loved the performance of George Breakston as Erno Nemescek and Jimmy Butler who played the part of Jano Boka. I am glad that this movie has finally made it out to the market. This is the kind of movie/book that needs to be reprinted many times like Rudyard Kipling's movie/book called Kim. Dean Stockwell was great in that movie. Loved him. I can't say enough nice things about this movie.,1308268800,7,537,4.546391752577319
