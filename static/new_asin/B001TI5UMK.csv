It will only work on 32 bit operating systesm, and requires that you either have an old version of Family Tree maker or the Archive Viewer. Again the Archive Viewer will not work on 64 bit operating systems or Windows 8. So you have to find one of your old PC's that runs something like Windows 97, you may not be able to view the contents of this CD. Elsewhere I saw a message saying that Ancestry.com had the data with their subscription, but as a subscriber, I could only find index information, which referenced a book, but no images to view online.

So buyer beware of the conditions described above before you order.
