Although the majority of the movie is more or less, a 'nature show,' it has some really interesting footage (pardon the pun) of the Big Guys that will make you think. Parts of the film are very spooky, like showing the Foots creeping along in the dark forest, and mysterious lights above the Alaskan Tundra.

Actually, i'll be as adventurous as this documentary and break it down for you.
Big foot's name was mentioned at least once every 5 minutes, just so you remembered that you didn't switch to a documentary of nature.
Believe it or not you do get to ""see"" big foot, at the end, in the last 10-15 minutes, for about 2 minutes of screen time.
Mind you, this was ""new"" footage, it's never shown, pictured etc, on most big foot things, so that was mildly refreshing.
If you want to watch it, just make sure it's free first, otherwise you could have spent the money elsewhere.

This movie was hard for me to follow - much more so than ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" - because it seemed to jump around and lacked consistency.  The basic story is:  wilderness man who does not believe in Bigfoot or else has no thoughts of Bigfoot confronts inescapable evidence of Bigfoots existence and sets out on personal quest to track and find him.  However there were many diversions from this basic plot, such as a squirrel run over by a truck and its struggles for survival, which, in my opinion, were just confusing distractions from the main storyline.",1391558400,,811,4.716312056737588

All you get here is a guy lying to you about being an 'expert tracker' and a HILARIOUS bad costume with a pointy head and BIG EARS splashing around (and getting blasted by a shotgun in the snowy woods in one scene)! So, so BAD. I cannot believe people are still getting sucked in by Marx's fake footage some 35+ (or more) years later! Do a google search on him and this 'documentary' if you don't believe me.
