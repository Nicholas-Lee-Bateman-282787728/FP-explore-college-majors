7849195,4,630344301X,The quality of the DVD is not great in spots but probably par for the course with DVDs. I couldn't resist this classic thriller. It truly keeps you guessing to the end.,1518480000,,168,4.28125
7849196,5,630344301X,"This is a miracle....I had recorded a short blurb on a VHS Tape recorded from TV and knew it was Alan Barnette Productions 1994 and that was all. I found a complete list of his projects on imdb but no soundtrack info anywhere. In my heart, I thought it was Gregg Allman singing the end credits, even though I had only a few short stanzas on my tape. After buying it on VHS from Amazon, I fast forwarded to the very end of the tape, so anxious to discover if it was Gregg or not. Thank the GODS !! IT IS !

Now I can watch the movie and I am certain it will be awesome !",1413936000,,569,3.8632478632478633
7849197,5,630344301X,"Oh my gosh.  I hunted this one down.  I remembered the tension 25 ears after I had viewed it.  VHS is not the choice of today, but I could not find DEAD AIR in any other form.  The quality was great and I had those same chills throughout.  If you haven't seen Gregory Hines in action you need to treat yourself.  He is gone now and there will be no new movies, so enjoy what he left behind.  Thrill and twisted, but really easy on the eyes.",1406764800,,440,3.9885057471264367
7849198,4,630344301X,"I found myself enjoying this movie more than I expected. It is basically one of countless rip-offs of Play Misty for Me, but it is well made. I thought Gregory Hines was excellent as a talented big city radio DJ making a fresh start in a small town.
Trouble is, he's got a maniac fan who keeps calling in and the bodies start piling up. There are plenty of characters to cast suspicion on, and the plot keeps you guessing until the end.
Debrah Farentino (NYPD Blue) is always nice to look at and and makes a satisfactory, if somewhat superficial, supporting character...",1041897600,,570,4.543689320388349
