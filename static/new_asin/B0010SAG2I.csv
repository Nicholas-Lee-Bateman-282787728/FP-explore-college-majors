8238326,5,B0010SAG2I,"This movie is about an aspiring chef and medical student who decide to give living together a try before settling down for marriage . Saif is an his best as always . He never disappoints . Preity is good in this role but not as good as some others I have seen her portray . She's a great actress I just felt her heart wasn't in it .

I highly recommend Planet Bollywood for all of your movie and DVD needs . They are a great company with super fast shipping and great packaging . Excellent customer service and such kind representatives to do business with . A++++++",1483401600,,566,4.2407407407407405

8238328,4,B0010SAG2I,"Film with great caste. Music is fun to listen to with good rhythms. Story is intersting but then ALL Hindi films are magical, fun, and fantasical stories.",1372550400,,154,4.7407407407407405
8238329,5,B0010SAG2I,Love the music and the two actors. Great quality and quick shipping! I bought this because I loved Kal Ho Naa Ho so much. I'm American and these movies are still awesome.,1360540800,,170,4.34375
8238330,2,B0010SAG2I,"Was sweet how they chose to portray an imperfect pregnant woman, but I was disappointed in how the movie strayed from traditional values and styles I'm used to seeing in Indian movies. If I wanted to see an American movie I'd watch an American movie.",1360281600,2,250,4.5777777777777775
8238331,1,B0010SAG2I,"You know, I simply do not even recall ever watching this bollywood flick. I can't tell you anything about it other than it shows in my records that I indeed purchased this Salaam Namaste DVD~oh goodness.... just remembered. YES! I had checked it out of the library abt one yr. ago and it was one of the most boring movies I ever set my eyes on, so I fell asleep. The high-pitched singing woke me up, so turned it off. The next day was gathering a bunch of DVDs I'd checked out to return them to the local library, however noticed my cat had knocked this dvd onto the floor & it cracked. This is why I purchased this movie, as a REPLACEMENT for the library as I obligated to. No, this movie really sucked. Good choice for insomniacs however.",1327795200,2,740,4.292857142857143
8238332,3,B0010SAG2I,"The theme of this movie -- two consenting adults living together must deal with an unwanted pregnancy very soon in their relationship -- might have been revolutionary by Indian standards, but it is no shocker for a Western audience. Its superficial plot, clich dialogues, and out-of-the-blue dance sequences could have driven this movie into the ground in the absence of decent performances delivered by Saif Ali Khan (Nick) and Preity Zinta (Amber). Even so, overall the film is mostly forgettable, unless one believes that Khan's well-groomed biceps and Zinta's pretty dimples can make up for implausible situations, characters introduced but then soon forgotten, unexplained contradictions in the plot, and a slapstick finale that did not mesh well with the general narrative.  Khan delivered a credible performance as the happy-go-lucky cook who only slowly warms up to the idea of assuming more responsibility for his actions. Occasionally his character is thoroughly deserving of antipathy. By contrast, Zinta's good moments are fewer, as she often overdoes it. Moms in the audience might hold their breadth when late in her pregnancy Zinta strains herself by constantly shouting and screaming, dancing vigorously, and running down the stairs.  The Crocodile Dundee character was thoroughly insufferable, but picturesque Melbourne helped ease the pain.",1317686400,3,1358,5.555555555555555
