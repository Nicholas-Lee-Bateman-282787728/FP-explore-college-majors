433514,5,630210176X,"To begin with I must have been about 11 or 12 years old when I first saw this movie on TV when I first came to this country from the little old island of Cuba some 90 miles from Miami. At any rate, that was when I began my love affair with horror movies. Anyhow, the second time that I saw was back in 1992 when rented it from my local video store and that was also when I made a mental note to purchase it, but unfortunately my efforts to locate it proved to be anything but fruitful. Then thanks a good friend of mine I was able to purchase it and now I am the prod owner of same.  Now as far as the film ism concerned, well, let me start by saying that the acting and the special effects are superb! And that is what made those movies great back then-and they are still great even today-thanks to the invention of the VCR.  Thanks Ray Harryhausen, you did a tremendous job!",1004832000,4,876,4.028735632183908
433515,4,630210176X,"This is one of the best ""giant menace on the loose"" films and was, in fact, the first such film since KING KONG, even tho KONG was made 20 years earlier.  Compare BEAST with more recent, similar, mega-budget flicks, and it comes out ahead!  Cliched in some ways, yes, but this is where most of those cliches started.  It is efficiently made, un-pretentious, and even includes some good acting.  Cecil Kellaway is especially good as a skeptical scientist who loses his skepticism one minute before the Beast eats him.  The Beast, by the way, is a fictional dinosaur species, but is very convincing as it rampages thru the concrete canyons of Manhattan.  Once again, Ray Harryhausen proves himself the master of creating great special effects on a low budget.  And wouldn't you LOVE to have that drawing via which our hero identifies the Beast?",993340800,4,842,4.805555555555555
433516,5,630210176X,"Perhaps it's the generic nature of the ""Beast"", but this film caused no specific ecentric behavior to emerge from Benjamin (4 years old) other than the occasional baring of claws and the occasional roar.  He just watches it and watches it and even shared it at school.  Always good at memorizing dinosaur names, Rotosaurus is now staple stock in his dinosaur panthion.  The movie is a beautiful piece of work, the continuity is excellent.  The only down side being that they had to blow up a perfectly good rollercoaster at the end to kill the thing.",980899200,4,550,4.697916666666667
433517,4,630210176X,"I drug this movie out a few days ago and watched it. I had forgotten just how good it was--one of the best monster movies of the 1950s as well as splendid work by Ray Harryhausen.
The script was believable, several character actors from these types of movies are present, particularly Kenneth Tobey (The Thing and It Came From Beneath the Sea), and the special effects are good for 1953. This was also one of Lee van Cleef's earliest performances as the Army sniper who firms the radioactive isotope into the wounded animal. He actually had hair back then!
The movie was the first in a series of reminders that man messing with atomic power is flirting with disaster. It came from the frozen north, and the beast was unleashed by the atomic blast.
One thing I noticed in particular.  For years, people thought dinosaurs were reptilian in nature, but the Jurassic Park films shed a different light on that with the raptor-like angle. The beast in this movie was moving around in the frozen north with no problems, which leads you to believe that the thought of dinosaurs being more birdlike had surfaced 47 years ago. Just a thought.",974678400,5,1132,4.66
433518,5,630210176X,"Quintessential '50s ""monster on the loose"" film.  An early Ray  Harryhausen effort that allows our favorite stop-motion animation genius to  show his stuff.  The script is an expanded version of a short story by  sci-fi author Ray Bradbury.  Much of the plot seems to be just the standard  cliches until one realizes this was the first of a long line of  pre-historic monster from the deep movies that followed and became part of  classic sci-fi film lore.  ""Gorgo,"" ""The Giant  Behemoth,"" and, of course, the original ""Godzilla"" were  influenced by this film.
The excitement really takes off during the  creature's spectacular attack on New York City.  The Beast rampaging  through the big-city canyons is one of monster filmdom's classic moments.  Cars are stomped, building walls are demolished, and people are either  eaten or trampled.  Harryhausen achieves a marvel of special effects  wizardry through smooth animation that seamlessly blends with live actors  and real-life backgrounds.  Superb lighting is also featured.  The shadows  created by the craggy New York skyline fall eerily on the Beast as it  proceeds through the streets. We know we are back in the '50s because the  Beast is a carrier of a vaguely defined contagion that has a suspicious  radioactive type effect.
As with other early Ray Harryhausen efforts, the  special effects transcend the restraints of the B&W photography and the  modest budget.  This film is a perennial classic in the sci-fi  ""monster"" movie category that collectors everywhere can  appreciate.  Recommended for both aficionados and beginners from the  younger generation.",965952000,5,1620,5.276679841897233
433519,5,630210176X,"Yeah, the film is in black & white!  Sure, the special effects are  from the pre-computer generated era!  Yes, the characters are  stereotypical!  OK! The smashed cars do look like toys.
But, this is the  best ""fish-out-of-water"" story ever filmed.  The stop-motion  effects of legendary Ray Harryhausen are still impressive even after almost  five decades.  The scene where the dinosaur is illuminated by military  lights is stunning.
The T-Rex in ""The Lost World"" is a  pussycat compared to the ""Rhedosaurus"" in this classic of the  sci-fi genre.
Two thumbs...no, two entire hands up for this gem!",958521600,5,599,5.114583333333333
433520,5,630210176X,Every time this movie came on tv I had to watch it. Saw it for the first time at the theatre as a kid. When it came out on video I had to have it. It's dated but it's great. If you like movies from that era you'll love  this one. It's amazing what they could do with the special effects before  computers. Great movie!,955238400,4,318,3.876923076923077
433521,5,630210176X,"This one scared the hell out of me as a kid and I still get that tingle every time I watch it. A classic monster film if there ever was one,Beast from 20,000 phathoms is Harryhousen at his best. According to a behind the  scenes interview with Harry,this film was such a low budget film,that the  producers required the talents of him to give the film a high-budget  appearance with the use of his wonderful special effects. May I say that  they succeeded in leaps and bounds. If any young person wishes to see what  was the ultimate ""C.G."" monsters were back then,just watch this  film and see what a 16"" piece 0f clay and a lot of imagination could  do!",951782400,5,655,4.363636363636363
433522,4,630210176X,"Hired by Jack Dietz and Hal Chester to make a monster movie, Ray Harryhausen had the opportunity to helm the special effects in a feature film for the first time. He worked several years earlier with his mentor  Willis O'Brien ( KING KONG ) on MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, a pseudo-remake of the  1933 classic that inspired young Ray. But MIGHTY JOE earned a reputation  for being exorbitant since it cost nearly $2 million to make ( due to  padding of expenses at RKO and overhead ). So Harryhausen had to devise an  inexpensive way to put monsters on the screen to insure the viability of  his career.
  Ray came up with a split-screen process using  rear-projection to combine his models with real photographic settings.  Shunning the impressive but expensive use of miniature sets and glass  paintings ala KONG, he came up with this simple means of putting his  creatures in the midst of a live-action scene. Later known as DYNAMATION,  the ""reality sandwich"" was his modus operandi for practically  every animation set-up for the rest of his professional calling.
  The  prehistoric star is a fictitious dinosaur called a ""Rhedosaurus""  which is largely based upon a crocodilian, even bearing an actual molded  skin pattern on its underbelly. It is remarkably similar in shape to the  New Zealand reptile tuatara, ironically a creature that is also the last of  its kind. Measuring some 200' in length and weighing 500 tons, it is  several times larger than any known prehistoric.
  Thawed out by an  atomic test in the Arctic, the monster makes it way down the Atlantic  seaboard, capsizing several boats on its way to some submurged canyons off  NYC. Coming ashore in Lower Manhattan, it kills many people and wreaks  destruction until it is finally destroyed by radioactive isotope shot into  a wound while attacking the roller coaster at Coney Island ( it was  actually filmed at Pacific Ocean Park on the West Coast ).
  The story  was based upon ""the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" by Harryhausen's  lifelong friend Ray Bradbury, which ran in the SATURDAY EVENING POST. This  short story is encapsulated in the lighthouse scene off the coast of Maine;  the rhedosaur is beckoned to and attacks the signal in a very atmospheric  sequence. Strangly enough, the producers based their screenplay upon this  tale and forgot the source, then called the author in for a revision!
  Starring Paul Christian, Paula Raymond and Cecil Kellaway, this movie was  the first linking atomic tests to giant creatures; it inspired the Japanese  to create Godzilla the following year. Goood acting, a credible storyline  for being a monster-on-the-loose yarn and great stop-motion from Ray make  this a winner all the way; it was made for only slightly over $200,000!  Director Eugene Lourie went on to make THE GIANT BEHEMOTH and GORGO to  become a ""sea-serpent"" trio with BEAST. Suitable for all ages,  except very young children ( < 5 yrs. of age ).",945561600,17,2929,4.895705521472393
433523,4,630210176X,"A hungry Verasaurus goes in search of his spawning grounds and stops off for a roller coaster ride at Coney Island.  This is a surprisingly engaging film that doesn't go overboard, mixing adequate special effects with a  decent story line and an unusual amount of character development for early  Science Fiction.  There are no standouts in the cast, but the acting is  superior to most films of this era and genre.  Watch for a very young Lee  Van Cleef as an Army sniper at the end of the movie.",943660800,2,497,4.51685393258427

433860,5,630210176X,"I remember watching this movie as a little kid on the Saturday Night Dr. Scar show in Tucson.  The animation is early Harryhausen work, but you can already see how he's giving the ""Rhedosaur"" a personality, as he did with all his animated creatures.  No simple lumbering monstrosity here.  The lighthouse scene was inspired by a short story from Ray Bradbury, a close friend to Harryhausen.

The plot has some twists to it.  Atomic blasts in the Arctic wake the frozen Rhedosaur which makes its way down the east coast to its old spawning grounds near New York, sinking boats and destroying a lighthouse on the way.  The Army attacks and manage to wound the beast - but it turns out that its blood is full of ancient microorganisms.  All the soldiers following the creature become ill from exposure to the blood.  The hero (who was working on the atomic tests in the beginning the picture) decides that a ""bullet"" made from a special radioactive isotope, if shot into the creature's wound, will ""sterilize"" its blood and remove the bio-threat.  Then the Rhedosaur can be safely destroyed.  Work with me here, folks, it makes sense in the movie.  Great carnage ensues, the sniper does his job from the top of a roller coaster (you'll have to watch the film to see why), things burn up, disaster is averted in a rather abrupt ending.

A little slow starting out by today's standards, this is nonetheless vintage monster magic.  Ray Harryhausen was a genius and I admire all his work.",1406678400,7,1481,4.6937984496124034

The cast is uniformly great (especially the incomparable Cecil Kellaway).  There are set pieces aplenty (my favorite scene involves a lighthouse).

433916,5,630210176X,"A prehistoric beast is unleashed from its icy tomb by a nuclear test that is conducted in the Arctic. The only witness, a brilliant physicist, tries to convince the military and top scientists of the creature's existence, but his stories are laughed off as the ravings of a madman. More rumors begin to surface as the giant lizard travels south along the Atlantic, and the professor is finally able to gain the support he needs in order to stop the beast, but not before the beast reaches New York City on its path of destruction!

THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS is the first combined effort between two of Science Fiction's most brilliant artists: writer Ray Bradbury and special effects master Ray Harryhausen. The two would start off on their long road together with this low-budget monster movie, directed by Eugene Lourie. Both men shared a love for 1925's THE LOST WORLD that would permanently shape each of their individual careers, and which can clearly be seen all throughout the film. BEAST would also be Harryhausen's first feature-length opportunity to display his own spectacular stop-motion animation in a series of stunning effects sequences that mirror the works of his mentor and colleague, Willis O'Brien (KING KONG). The Beast's rampage through downtown Manhattan has become one of the defining moments in Science Fiction cinema as a result, effortlessly blending Harryhausen's effects with the live-action events on-screen.

The story line from THE BEAST can also be recognized in countless Science Fiction and Fantasy films from the 1950's and 60's, where both the country's leading scientists and military officials must team up to destroy a common threat. This, and the socio-political subtext surrounding nuclear testing, would have an immediate effect on the Nuclear Era, most notably in THEM! and GOJIRA from the following year. Paul Hubschmid's charming and charismatic scientist serves as a strong lead, with many enjoyable moments also coming out of Cecil Kellaway's performance as the reluctant professor.

THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS is an important milestone in the Science Fiction and Horror genres, and one that would help to shape the Giant Monster movie for decades after its release.

433917,4,630210176X,"In the Arctic, off the northern coast of Baffin Island, an atomic bomb test is made - atomic scientist Tom Nesbitt (Paul Hubschmid) wonders if we are creating a new world - or ending the old one. Pessimistic perhaps but also prophetic as soon a monster appears, unleashed by the huge explosion breaking it free of millions of years being frozen in the ice. Nesbitt and another member of the expedition alone see it, but the other crewman is killed, and Nesbitt is taken to a hospital in the states, and thought to be crazy. Shortly, however, there are reports of ships mysteriously sinking...a couple of surviving crewmembers give stories of sea serpents and monsters, similar to Nesbitt's. The scientist, discharged from the hospital, finds paleontologist Thurgood Elson (Cecil Kellaway), who at first dismisses his claims, but soon - in part through the persuasive powers of his young and pretty assistant Lee Hunter (Paula Raymond) - comes to believe that Nesbitt's monster is in fact a surviving dinosaur of enormous size. And it's heading towards New York!

What I like most about THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS is that it's so straightforward. There's no ""Red Scare"" theme here; there's only that very brief mention of the potential dangers of atomic power early on (though I guess there's a bit of a subtext throughout the film); there's little exposition and what there is comes briefly and to the point; there's only a minimal love story angle; and the inevitable conflict between scientific desires ('we have to study it, not kill it') and the military solution is played out smoothly and fairly realistically - nobody wants to do anything to the monster until it become necessary, at which point every power is brought to bear as quickly as possible. This is a rapidly-paced, no-nonsense example of what the b-science fiction films of the 50s could be at their best, done in crisp and stark black and white on a low - but not obviously cheapo - budget.

Much thanks to the look and feel of the film have to go to both it's director, the Russian-born Frenchman Eugne Louri, an art director under Jean Renoir among other directors, making his debut at the helm with this film; and special effects technician Ray Harryhausen, on just the second film for which he can be considered a primary contributor.  Both went on to distinguished careers in genre filmmaking, though Harryhausen is much better known today.  The dinosaur effects are pretty terrific for their time; I particularly like the destruction of the lighthouse, and of course the famous amusement park finale. And it should be mentioned that though the two big names here both are ""technical"" guys, the acting is certainly adequate, and Louri and his many cowriters (adapting a Ray Bradbury story) strip the story down to fairly basic elements, with the end result being that there's hardly a wasted word of dialogue - everything goes to building tension and creating larger and larger potentials for havoc wreaked by the prehistoric beastie. It's also worth noting that the creature is treated with almost complete neutrality here - we are neither asked to hate it nor feel sorry for it; it's simply a big, unthinking menace to humanity that can't be reasoned with. It's us or it. Sometimes that simplicity is just what you want in this kind of film.

The Warner DVD is strikingly good looking, with excellent tonal contrasts and a high level of sharpness; the converstation between Rays Bradbury & Harryhausen is quite nice (Bradbury is much the more talkative of the two) and really gives a hint into what that lost golden age of the early SF film - and literature, and comics - must have been like.  Overall I don't think this is among the very top 50s SF films, but it's at least high in the second tier, and I'd certainly warmly recommend it to all genre fans.",1290988800,2,3835,4.811836115326252

If your a fan of stop motion animation or not, this monster film will be fun to watch. I bought this movie with the film ""Them"" on the flip side. The beast is a bad monster and Harryhausen brings him to life in a great way. Enjoy!",1289347200,,657,4.264
433919,5,630210176X,"This film holds a special place in my movie-viewing experience as I was first captivated by it as a youth and I have never quite forgotten it. The star of the movie is the beast and its actuator, the gifted and great animator Ray Harryhausen, whose magical work left me spellbound throughout my youth  (who can forget the spectacular scene of the Ymir standing atop the Roman Coliseum in 20,000 MILLIONS MILES TO EARTH [1957] or the saucers crashing into the Capitol  building and the Washington Monument in EARTH VERSUS THE FLYING SAUCERS [1956] or the amazing scene of the skeletonized dead  sprouting from the earth to battle Jason in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS [1963]...and more, whew!). Harryhausens ""dynamation"" special effects technique used both sounds  [who can forget the creaking  Talos in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, 1963]  and soundtrack [how about BERNARD HERRMANN's awe-inspiring score in MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, 1961] to enhance the animation experience.

This low-budget film is about a fictional prehistoric beast disinterred from its Artic icecap grave by nuclear testing. It is based on a 1951 short story by Harryhausen's lifelong friend, science fiction icon Ray Bradbury. The beast migrates southward in an instinctual trek to the undersea canyons where it once resided wrecking fishing vessels and lighthouses along the way before its epic traipse down the streets of New York. Except for a couple of close-ups of the beast rising from the water where a static model was clearly utilized, the special effects were amazing for its time. Remember that movies like JURASSIC PARK [1993] had the benefit of huge budgets making now-available advanced special effects technology feasible. Harryhausen had only his mind, his models, his magic and lots of patience.

Released at the dawn of the baby-boomer explosion, and only 8 years after the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the film seemed to mirror the unspoken fears of many at the prodigious destructive power of nuclear weapons and what they could uncover both in the minds and memories of men and on their planet. However, when power, especially the power to ablate implicitly and without peer, is acquired prematurely civilized/socialized man often paradoxically regresses to his suppressed primitive self---with reverence, humility and wisdom going out the window. The angry beast in this film---rudely released from its frozen slumber by a destructive man-made device---could easily symbolize a disturbed nuclear opponent, nuclear disarray, nuclear escalation or man's primitive [arrogant and egocentric, imperious and self-deifying, disinhibited and carnal] self, the latter capable of so much disorder and destruction. The plot of this story had much to do with man's chronic anxiety over his tacit lack of preparedness for the potential  complications of his foray into the atomic age and  incertitude with regard to the long-term effects of his dallying with frequent nuclear testing which are still unknown. The theme of Cold War nerves is also prevalent.

While radioactive power had released the beast it also unleashed a pandora's box as the blood of the wounded predator contained primitive germs to which man was never exposed to and, thus, was not immune to. Man's haphazard attempt to destroy what he does not understand proves costly as the target is now more virulent and deadly. Interesting how nature takes care of things---man, who condensed and distributed this radioactive poison, now being extirpated by the mindless victim of his carelessness and poor judgement---so that it never happens again.

Killing the creature now becomes a problem as physical dissolution of the viremic animal would spread more germs into the air and cause even greater human malady.  They must destroy the beast from the inside without  putting any more holes on its exterior  that would allow more toxic plasma to spill into the environment. Man, as is often the case, goes back to the poison that got him into this mess.  They  postulate that a concentrated amount of deadly radioactive material shot directly into the creature's open wound would do the trick. Tough task as the perturbed and thrashing-about creature provides an unsteady target. Geez, would not want to be the sharp-shooter in this one: he gets one look, one attempt, has gotta make it, terrible visibility [at night and through goggles] and no more radioisotope as this is the last batch. The 'dead shot' summoned is played by none other than a young Lee Van Cleef of spaghetti Western fame. He arrives cool, cocky and self-assured but it all goes out the window pretty quickly as he is given his one-strike-your-out instructions. This last scene is the memorable amusement park scene [purportedly the landmark Coney Island park in New York but actually another locale] with the marksman and his guide having to ride a rollercoaster up closer to the irritable beast to get a better view of the small gape target.

Will never forget actor Cecil Kellaway's stirring description of the beast after sighting it, while inside a diving bell, swirling around in the underwater canyons. And how about actor Kenneth Tobey, the GREAT ""B""-flick  character actor with the weather-beaten face, who could make the most incredible scenarios believable and dramatic. A bit of the compulsory corny dialogue thrown in for the youngsters but it mixes well with the bristling drama. Must laud the tremendous and memorable score by David Buttolph imbuing the film with a continual sense of foreboding and sinister dread. This is the type of movie for which black & white filming added to the viewing experience especially in filming the beast's nocturnal maritime and municipal attacks. I have never looked at the waters off the Maine/New England shores the same again.

Always eternally grateful to Mr Harryhusen who, in the midst of the post-KING KONG [1933] special effects drought, was able to bring life to monsters, mythical figures and the dead for the visual, escapist and entertainment pleasure of a lot of computer-less and cable TV-less baby boomers bored with the mostly tepid science fiction of the 50's and 60's. From personal experience, and I'm sure many would agree,  Mr Harryhausen's contribution to science fiction had an impact, transcending sociocultural impositions to open doors of awareness and of possibilities and kindling a sense of adventure,  of wonder and awe about nature and our planet that would somehow influence the life path and ultimate vocation of many a hungry youngster from those times.

The DVD picture quality is excellent. There are two commemorative 50th anniversary documentaries included: one has Harryhausen providing insightful info regarding the making of this film, and the other an endearing talk between lifelong friends Harryhausen and Ray Bradbury recounting their influences and experiences. A final thanks to Willis H. O'Brien and THE LOST WORLD [1925] for being the major impetus for these two science fiction legends.",1278633600,,6997,5.222123104371097

433952,4,630210176X,"This is a great DVD and a great presentation of classic Ray Harryhausen special effects.  Special Features include Making of the Beast interview with Harryhausen on what they went through to make the film.  What struck me was his claim that this film was his first solo effort in a low budget picture; the studio gave him free reign and so he build the ONE monster for all effects.  The second feature is a chat between Bradbury and Harryhausen that is endearing and a fascinating look  into the minds of what many consider to be the best science fiction team.  Ray Bradbury's story The Foghorn inspired ""Beast.""

The monsterous Rhedosaurus (or ""Ray""-dosauraus?) is awakened from his 100 million year sleep from an atomic bomb blast (footage from old atom bomb films inserted here) and instinctively starts walking/swimming back to his original home in the ""Hudson Submarine Canyons.""  Unfortunately, New York City is in the way and they're not too kind to tourists, especially grouchy ones who've just woke up.

Our hero is Tom Nesbitt (Paul Christian (aka Hubschmid), in a few films like:&nbsp;]) who is doing some surveying after the atom bomb blast in the Arctic.  His friend falls into a crevass after getting scared to death from the Beast.  With a swish of his tail, avalanche happens, the friend dies and Tommy is taken back to a hospital in New York City (why not Canada if he was in such bad shape?  Oh well..).

Everyone thinks Tom is nuts that he's seen the monster.  The plot is mostly standard -- no one believes until it's too late.  Woman believes him, fall in love.  The End.  But the interesting twist is that the Beast's blood creates a virus that kills people.  How do you kill the Beast without it's blood all over the place?

Interesting scenes include:  The bomb blast.  How many different bits of film footage can you spot?  Boat gets crushed, great water effects.  Bathysphere gets chomped on.  The lighthouse, taken from Bradbury's The Foghorn short story -- went a bit faster than I'd liked.&nbsp;]

Cheesy Lines:  ""A girl like you is a paleontologist?""  The ""girl"" is played by Paula Raymond, sexy gal who's also known for her appearance on Blood of Dracula's Castle.&nbsp;]]

Harryhausen said here that he tried to glamorize the dinosaur which he does with skill here.  The beast, as usual, dies like an opera singer!  A must-see!

Just as he says ""But the most astounding thing is..."" GULP, the beast swallows him, his assistant and the diving bell all together. Wow!! The stop action special effects, compliments of Ray Harryhausen and, at the end, the motion picture debute of Lee Van Cleef as the shooter, add to the fun.",1253923200,,593,4.351351351351352
433957,4,630210176X,"This was Ray Harryhausen's first major film work and to me his Rhedosaurus,aka The Beast,is arguably his most finest work. It is a simple and straight forward stop motion presentation that works perfectly,and actually serves to elevate a rather tepid story.
It involves a group of scientists who venture to the North Pole to observe and take measurements of an atomic bomb test. As they check their their device stations post-blast,one of the group hears and spies a huge dinosaur wandering the area. Injured he calls for help and is rescued by a Prof. Nesbit(Paul Hubscmhid/Christian) who also briefly spots the beast. Colonel Evans(Keith Tobey well known from The Thing)does not believe the story as well as Dr Elson(well known character actor Cecil Kellaway),back in New York.
When stories of boat sinkings start popping up along the Atlantic coast Prof. Nesbitts' story finally gets credibility. In fact Dr Elson takes a bathysphere down into the Hudson River Trench off of NYC to see if the creature has returned to that area(skeletons of a dinosaur matching the beasts description were found there).The beast has indeed returned there and Dr. Elson becomes a mid morning snack for the creature. Eventually the beast checks out the environs of the Big Apple spilling its' blood as it meets with stiff resistance from the local police and armed forces. They soon learn the beasts' blood carries a virulent strain of bacteria that along with the beast himself,is dropping people like flies.
When the beast arrives at Coney Island to check out the roller coaster there,the professor gets the idea to shoot a radioactive dart into the creature at the top of the ride,which they do. Amidst an engulfing fire the creature writhes and finally dies in agony. The world is saved.
On paper the story is a good one but in execution(direction and acting) it is generally wooden. The best parts of the film are the creature's appearances throughout,and they are spectacular. Its' various journeys through the city are excellently done and worked in seamlessly with the background. This is due to Harryhausen's great and meticulous work.
I would normally give a B-film like this around a three star rating but what bumps this DVD up is first and foremost,the wonderful print they have used. It is generally crisp and clear and a joy to watch. I have never seen it in better condition;a nod to Warner Brothers for such a great job. Second are the nice extras. Along with the usual trailer are two wonderful vignettes. The first one is a nice retrospective on the making of The Beast. The second is a nice interview with the two Ray's,Harryhausen and Bradbury. As you will learn,if you didn't know before,it was their love of dinosaurs(The Lost World,1925,specifically and Willis O'Brien's groundbreaking work),that brought them together those many,many years ago. The interview is in front of a studio audience and took place in 2003.
In conclusion despite The Beast's definite B-movie status,the titles' object of our affection steals every scene that it is in;a case of the special effects being better than the movie they inhabit. In other words because of the quality of Harryhausen's work the film is more memorable than it has a right to be. The print used here is magnificent and the two nice vignettes included definitely elevate this DVD release from a three star to a four.
For the current price this release is a definite steal and I recommend you get your copy today!",1235692800,,3469,4.941780821917808

A giant monster is running loose - called a Rhedosaurus (fictional) simple as that. This is the movie that inspired Godzilla. No joke. Lee Van Cleef fires the shot that ends the monsters destructive path. The stop motion effects here are just fantastic. Watch the Beast wreck New York City,and learn this creature has a dark secret in his blood,which turned out to be the modern topic for what made monsters int he 1950s. I find stop motion to still be superior to some of today's movies. These movies have a certain charm that newer movies lack.

433976,3,630210176X,"I first saw The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms in 1953 as a small child and thoroughly enjoyed this film.  When I first saw it I would have rated it at five stars but would only rate it today at three.  This DVD was an excellent transfer and was beautiful.

I thought the DVD was excellent and a very good value. The film itself was literally hand made by the famous Ray Harryhausen for well under $200,000, and then sold to a studio for $400,000. It went on to earn millions of dollars and to become a film classic. His technique was improved and perfected over the years resulting in some of our favorite fantasy movies.

I remember seeing advertising for the Beast pasted all over the Bronx in the summer of 1953, and asking my mom to take me to this film which she did not wish to see. She asked my poor old grandfather to bring me to the theater and since he was always agreeable, he consented.

I then saw this movie with my grandfather at a local neighborhood theater one Sunday afternoon in the old Bronx. The kids in the LUXOR Theater loved the film and were roaring with assorted comments. I guess my grandfather, who was ""baby sitting"" for me, did not enjoy it nearly as much.  He snored his way through the entire film and only woke up to ask ""How much longer is the movie and are you enjoying it?""

His snoring blended in with the low rumble of the Beast very nicely and the kids seated around us laughed between their bouts of yelling.  This childhood memory demonstrated to me that my grandfather could indeed sleep under any and all conditions, something he boasted he could do going back to his boyhood in the old country when working on the farm.  Grandfather was definitely not a science fiction fan but a good scout.",1215907200,5,1731,4.384375
433977,5,630210176X,"Eugene Lourie made the same film three times and this one is the best of the three, though the other two: THE GIANT BEHEMOTH(1959) and GORGO(1961) are pretty good as well.
When an atomic bomb goes off near the Artic Circle it unleashes a sleeping giant Rhedosaurus that soon begins moving south toward it's place of birth near NYC., destroying fishing boats, lighthouses or whatever is in it's path.
Paul Christian plays a welcomed french-speaking scientific hero-type giving the role a more unusual slant. Kenneth Tobey (THE THING...FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA)) plays his military role from memory as does friendly professor Cecil Kellaway who gets swallowed up in a diving bell. Other familiar faces abound including King Donovan (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), Frank Fergeson (Mayberry's Foley the butcher), Jack Pennick (John Ford regular) and James Best (KILLER SHREWS) in one of his earliest screen appearences. Pretty Paula Raymond (HAND OF DEATH) is better than most as the female love interest.
However..., even though the army can't kill the beast, it takes future Spaghetti Western superstar Lee Van Cleef just one shot to do him in! Sergio Leone must have been watching this one.
A TRUE CLASSIC of 1950's sci-fi, right up there with THE THING..., THEM and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Not to be missed.",1214092800,,1340,5.013452914798206
433978,4,630210176X,"A product of 1950s science-fiction mania, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS went on to not merely become a big hit in its day, but to become one of the most iconic of all sci-fi films of any cinematic era.  One of the first of many giant-monster movies, BEAST also heralded the coming of the atom-age monster, paving the way for everything from GODZILLA to GORGO and even THEM!.  Ray Harryhausen is especially remembered for the special effects that brought the eponymous beast to life, and they hold up very well today.  The ""Rhedosaurus"" is no paltry CGI illusion, but a truly terrifying full-scale monster.  The difference may surprise younger movie-goers who think every fantasy creature should look like the low-budget CGI creations often seen on the Sci-Fi Channel.  The Beast is an entirely different breed of animal, and Harryhausen's creation possesses an awesome physical presence on-screen.  But while the monster itself gets all the good press, the rest of the movie is high quality as well.  The script is perhaps a bit slow, but it does try to develop the fantastic plot with some attention to realism, while the main characters are fairly well developed and sympathetic for this type of film.  The fiery climax at Coney Island is a great payoff for an excellent all-round fantasy picture.  The DVD was a Christmas gift last year, and one I know I'll watch over and over again.  If you like 50s-style science fiction, BEAST is one of the special ones.",1212624000,2,1461,4.831325301204819

I wasn't expecting an award winning feature, just the typical monster movie fare.  This was a good movie, the monster was the most realistic looking of it's genre, acting was on par with other movies of this time period, and much better than that of monster movies which were made more recently.

What I really wanted to know, prior to purchase was that this DVD would be in a condition similar to the rest of my collection, that it would play well, and be something I could comfortably loan to friends and family.

This DVD more than met all of my expectations, and left no doubt in my mind that I could trust the person I bought it from to provide quality products in the future, and that those products would be as advertized.",1203292800,,870,4.385093167701863
433981,5,630210176X,"It may come as a surprise to many, but Godzilla was not the first ancient ""monster"" reawakened by the testing of nuclear weapons; in fact, there is reason to believe that Godzilla was influenced to a significant extent by this 1953 classic.  Produced on a miniscule budget of some two hundred thousand dollars, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms features high quality all across the board: an intelligent script, some pretty good acting, and wonderful direction (by first-time director Eugene Lourie) - the film even showcases a rare example of beneficial stock footage.  What make it particularly special and memorable, however, are the special effects by Ray Harryhausen, the veritable king of stop-motion animation.  Remember the incredible animation of King Kong in the original 1933 film?  Well, Harryhausen took those same animation techniques to a whole new level, using actual footage as the backdrops for scenes featuring the beast wreaking havoc in New York City.  I actually prefer great stop-motion animation like this to today's CGI, as a Harryhausen beast such as this one seems more real to me.

The story opens in the Arctic Circle, where scientists are conducting nuclear weapons tests.  Two scientists go out to check readings, but only one comes back.  The survivor is rushed to a hospital in the States, and as soon as he is awake he starts telling people about the gigantic dinosaur he saw before he collapsed in the snow.  Not surprisingly, no one believes his story.  As a scientist, though, Tom Nesbitt (Paul Hubschmid) knows that what he saw was real.  After hearing the account of a fishing boat up north being attacked by a ""sea serpent,"" he goes to see Professor Thurgood Elson (Cecil Kellaway), one of the most renowned paleontologists in the world, but the professor refuses to believe the impossible.  The same goes for all of Nesbitt's superiors, who dismiss his ""hallucination"" as a mere product of shock.  Dr. Elson's assistant, Lee Hunter (Paula Raymond), is a little more sympathetic to Nesbitt's account (and not only because she's obviously attracted to him), though, and the two of them work to gather the proof needed to convince others of the prehistoric creature's existence.

Don't ask me how a cold-blooded reptile, no matter how large he is, can possibly survive the freezing temperatures of the Arctic for very long or how he can stay under water for as long as he wants without breathing.  Just know that this beast, identified as a Rhedosaurus (not a real dinosaur, so don't bother looking it up), does these things - and he comes ashore in New York City about the same time that Nesbitt finally manages to get anyone important to believe his story.  New York's finest quickly learn that standard guns and ammo just aren't going to work, and things only get worse when scientists discover that the creature's newly-shed blood is potentially even more dangerous than the physical destruction the beast leaves in his wake.  The final showdown, which takes place at Coney Island, is actually rather sad and tragic, especially for those of us who sympathize with the beast.

The only thing I don't like about this film is the fact that it identifies Ray Bradbury as one of the writers.  It just so happened that one scene in the film ended up sounding a lot like a scene from one of Bradbury's stories (""The Foghorn""), and so the studio bought the rights to it - to avoid a possible lawsuit, one must assume.  It's also no secret that Bradbury and Harryhausen were good friends.  My point, though, is that any reference to this film being written by Bradbury is a vast overstatement.  In practical terms, he did little more than read over the script and remark that one scene sounded like a scene in one of his stories.

The bottom line is that The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms is one of the best - and certainly one of the most influential - monster movies ever made, and I find it regrettable that it gets far less attention than the monsters and monster movies that came after it.  Despite (and in many ways because of) its comparatively small budget, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms more than deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Godzilla.",1198022400,2,4187,4.823776223776224
433982,4,630210176X,"The screenplay for The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms is loosely based on a short story by Ray Bradbury that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post under the title The Fog Horn. When nuclear testing in the North Pole wakes a fictional carnivorous dinosaur known as the Rhedosaurus, the beast heads toward its familiar mating grounds near New York City and begins a rampage.
The Beast... is one of the more fast paced, better written and directed monster movies of the 1950's. Though many tried to imitate its success few came close to beating out the sheer excitement and awe of Harryhausen's Rhedosaurus. Even Tonka and Honda admitted to stealing a few elements for Godzilla.

The Beast...served as Harryhausen's first solo feature film endeavor after working with Willis O'Brien on Mighty Joe Young. Harryhausen continues to be a household name due to his creature work that has spanned some thirty years culminating in such classics as The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad,  Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans.",1198022400,,1012,4.982248520710059

434009,4,630210176X,"It's hard to realize why this early stop-motion animation ""beast on the loose"" film is so warmly remembered until you actually see it, since it doesn't seem from its description like it should be that special. Its plot of a monster released by atomic radiation attacking a city has been repeated again and again, and owes much to both the 1933 KING KONG and the 1925 THE LOST WORLD (as Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen, who respectively wrote its original story and created its effects, cheerfully admit in the accompaying feature). But in many ways this set the standard for the films of this sort that dominated the sci-fi films of the 50s, and the beast itself is really a marvel. Whereas King Kong was childlike, given to charming bits of curiosity and childish tantrums of rage, and the later (much inferior) Godzilla simply incarnated pure chaos, the Beast here has become much beloved over the decades because it is so ornery. It attacks fishing trawlers, lighthouses, diving bells and the docks of Manhattan for no good reason other than that it's particularly grumpy and ill-tempered, which makes it all the more adorable. (It even looks like a cross between a pit bull and a gila monster.)

As with most 1950s monster films, the stuff that comes in-between the Beast's rampages is pretty forgettable, although the Swiss Paul Hubschmid (here called Paul Christian) is a pretty unusual choice as the hero, and Paula Raymond, as the fretful assistant to a paleontology professor, is for some reason given a hilarious array of the very latest in New Look fashions in every scene she's in. Probably the film's producers figured if they couldn't give us the animated Harryhausen model of the rhedosaurus they'd have to give us something, so there she is sporting others sorts of the very latest models.",1182988800,,1806,4.863636363636363

434012,3,630210176X,"It would be a mistake to write off ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" as being too clich; for to do so would be to forget that most of the clichs that are in the movie originated with this movie.  This movie is undoubtedly one of the original sources for the many movies which are put into the creature feature category.  It uses the Godzilla like premise of an ancient monster being reawakened due to nuclear testing.  Throw in the hero who isn't believed by his colleagues, and the woman scientist who is the only one who listens to him, and you have the elements of more 50's science fiction movies than I care to count.

The storyline is simple, atomic testing releases a Rhedosaurus from the arctic ice.  When two observers are measuring the results of the test, one is killed while the other, Professor Tom Nesbitt, is injured but manages to survive.  His story is attributed to stress and he is shipped back to New York for treatment.  As he recovers, stories begin to appear about sea monsters which convince him that what he remembers is true.  He gets the aid from Professor Thurgood Elson and his assistant Lee Hunter.  Together they finally convince the armed forces, but not until it is too late and the beast has made it to New York City.  Panic ensues as the beast destroys sections of the city until the final climactic scene at the Coney Island Rollercoaster.

This was a very low budget movie, costing around $210,000 to make.  Not surprisingly it doesn't have any big stars, although you may recognize some character actors from other roles.  Paul Hubschmid plays Professor Nesbitt, and Paula Raymond plays Lee Hunter.  Two names which do stand out are those of Ray Harryhausen who was responsible for the animation, and Ray Bradbury who wrote the short story ""The Fog Horn"", on which this film is somewhat based.  The film was directed by Eugne Louri.

Make no mistake, this is not a great film, but it is fun and it has an undeniable place in the history of science fiction and the movies.  It was nominated in 2004 for the Retro Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form for pieces which debuted in the year 1953.  The film is just 79 minutes long, and yet it probably could have been shortened a bit as it does drag at times.  The pace does pick up at the end as they fight the beast in the streets of New York.

The transfer of the movie for the most part looks very good.  The special features are decent, with a couple of short documentaries.  The first is ""The Rhedosaurus and the Roller Coaster: Making the Beast"" which is just a short feature about the movie.  The second is ""Harryhausen & Bradbury"" which features the two men talking about their long friendship and their love of dinosaurs.  There are also four trailers, including one for his movie, and then ones for ""The Black Scorpion"", The Valley of Gwangi"", and ""Clash of the Titans"".",1171324800,15,2873,4.56640625

434014,4,630210176X,"This is one of those nifty sci-fi movies from the heyday of American sci-fi, the 1950's. Special thanks go to the Cold War for being such a catalyst. This time around, it isn't radiation that causes existing creatures to become giants; rather, this giant has miraculously survived for 100 million years by being frozen in the Arctic! The rhedosaurus journeys from the Arctic to New York, which is where some of its ancestors' fossils had been found. Really this is just an excuse to provide an exciting location for the action, which does make for a more interesting movie. Even though I grew up watching horror and sci-fi from the 1940s through the 1970s, I am somewhat hesitant to watch these movies today because the special effects have come a long way since then. Sometimes I prefer a physical object to CGI though; call me old-fashioned, but CGI is occasionally rendered in such a way as to be barely superior to hand-drawn animation. Nonetheless, I am impressed by how well Ray Harryhausen's effects in this movie have held up. They look very respectable indeed, and the sound for the dinosaur is fantastic. It is no ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Walking with Dinosaurs,"" but the manner in which it was filmed holds the limitations of the effects to a minimum. The movie also relies more on Ray Bradbury's story than on its effects, which also limits the rhedosaur's screen time. The acting is also better than average, with some performances seeming less formal and wooden than their 1950s contemporaries. The result is a very enjoyable monster movie that delivers on many counts. The DVD also offers a clean transfer, subtitles and a documentary.

The art direction on these 50-year-old plus flicks is often stunning; the artists who worked on them were often old-school art school graduates trained in the finest of fine arts painterly techniques. I've seen background paintings and glass shots (a painting on glass that the camera shoots through) from films of this era (and older) that surpassed all the ""artistry"" found in a single modern flick. I've seen sci-fi design of earlier eras that beat out nearly anything today in terms of visual bravura. Directors of that era often knew how to milk all the horror and terror out of scenes that were merely suggestive (try the original ""The Haunting"" for a good example of that). Today we can show any horror in the greatest detail and its just sick and awful.

This movie is stuffed with visually striking moments--the monster's sillouetted attack on the lighthouse, the undersea search for the beast in the bathysphere, the street carnage with the iconic devouring of the police officer, the strikingly imaginative death of the monster. A lot went into this old dog and it still works great, especially in black and white. It provides the film with the needed dreamlike quality that color film seldom seems to achieve.

I write a fair number of reviews of movies of this era and I'm trying to gently steer people away from seeing them as merely camp or nostalgic, and instead appreciating them as minor, and sometimes major, works of visual art. Ray Harryhausen, who worked on this film, was a wonder with stop-motion effects but he was also a visual poet of the highest order who knew how to bring drama, wonder, and magic to the screen. Look, for just one example, at his work on ""First Men in the Moon."" I sensed that Spielberg, in his ""War of the Worlds"" paid endless tribute to the often astounding visual poetry of this era. Note how much horror and terror he was able to conjure up (some sort of record, I'd say) without being overtly graphic.

434037,4,630210176X,"THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS is a 1953 classic of the ""Radiation is Coming to Get Us"" genre of 1950's sci-fi movies.

The Beast itself is a fictional species of dinosaur who is awakened from his (?) slumbers under the Arctic ice cap by the climatic changes caused by atomic bomb testing (an early indictment of global warming, in retrospect).

The creature then heads for its ancient breeding grounds like a salmon swimming upstream. Unfortunately for the ruling mammals of this planet, the Beast's nest is located somewhere in what is now midtown Manhattan, and the Beast proceeds to destroy New York City in the process of her (?) homecoming.

The military is called out to fight the creature, at first unsuccessfully. It seems the Beast's blood is chemically-bacteriologically toxic to humans, and a way must be found to neutralize the effects of this evil substance. Recall if you will, that Communists were supposed to be tampering with the fluoridation of drinking water in those years, and this segment takes on a whole new depth.

The movie reaches its rather abrupt climax at Rockaway Playland in the midst of a flaming roller-coaster.

Despite occasionally meandering through stock footage, the film, based on a story by Ray Bradbury, is a good, strong one, redolent of Cold War fear, and handled very competently.

Memorable scenes include seeing the city's buildings collapse dramatically (not as entertaining post 9/11, unfortunately), a moment when the Beast decides to treat one of New York's Finest as a canape (I still remember the ""Ewww!"" wrung from me in childhood), and the creature's headlong crash through a tenement building (I recall at age 12 convulsing my relatives with laughter by saying, ""Musta been a railroad apartment."" You have to be a New Yorker to REALLY appreciate this film.)

The best thing about THE BEAST is the Beast, a beautiful early example of Ray Harryhausen's stop-action animation techniques, never outmatched until the advent of CGI. The Beast still has an aesthetic quality to it which JURASSIC PARK never, ever approached.

THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS directly inspired the Japanese creation of Godzilla, though lacking Harryhausen the Tokyo studios were forced to rely on a man in a rubber suit filmed most often in long shots. The Godzilla franchise was ultimately responsible for more than 30 films, each of which was worse than the last.

None of the Godzilla films had the dramatic impact of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, which remains a fine example of truly quality ""B"" filmmaking a half-century on.",1118966400,2,2560,5.033096926713948

This is a great showcase for stop-motion effects legend, Ray Harryhausen.

As an adult, I can now see places where the Beast appears more model than actual monster. However, even to my adult eyes, there are definitely moments when the Beast genuinely looks like a real dinosaur, such as when walking through New York City street intersections and the shadows and animation are very convincing. I can understand why, when growing up, I considered this movie to be more documentary than just movie. The movie also has this advantage over some modern movies; it is dead serious from beginning to end, without foolish toilet scenes such as in Juraissic Park. I also consider the Rhedosaurus more scary than a Speilberg T-REx. One might knock the acting, but it's fine for what it is and just as good as many.

The interplay with the miniatures and the black and white stock combine for a memorable romp through New York.  Yes, the characters are mostly wooden but the disbelieved scientist who tries to convince others he's seen a monster after arctic nuclear tests is one of the better in the genre.

Dispensing with ships and lighthouses along the way it is a fearsome sight to behold when it makes landfall.  An enduring image of 50's sci-fi/horror has it crunching along the thoroughfare in downtown NYC as a squad of police attempt to stop it with shotguns.  Not going to happen!  Another interesting decision was to make the blood of the creature radioactive so as to further tie the hands of the army and authorities when dealing with it.

The creature makes its way to New York eventually smashing its way through the city and killing a number of people.  The film is based on a story by Ray Bradbury and stars mostly a cast of unknowns although a young Lee Van Cleef, who would go onto fame in Spaghetti westerns, does play a role.  In general the acting is the pretty hokey stuff you got with sci-fi films of the 1950's.

The real star of the movie is the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen in his first big solo-effort.  Ray learned his craft under the great Willis O'Brien who did the effects for King Kong, Son of Kong, and others.  Ray's meticulous planning of the creatures movements lends a sense of realism not seen in other's use of stop-motion.  It honestly comes off as far more realistic than a guy in a suit that would be used in the movie it inspired the following year, ""Godzilla"".  Terrific set pieces and miniatures really enhance the movie including the fantastic attack on the lighthouse and the climax at Coney island.  Amazingly, this was all done on a budget of around $200,000.

The story is definitely enjoyable but nothing original from giant monster films of the time where the main character(s) try to convince the world that a giant creature exists.

The effects by Harryhausen are superb for his first solo film and, in my opinion, some of his best work. The Rhedosaurus moves with great fluidity and blends in really well with the actual city backdrop.

434043,3,630210176X,"The last time I saw this movie was the same day I went to the theater to see the blockbuster ""Jurassic Park"". The two films represent two eras in American society and its fantasies about what dinosaurs could become in the atomic and nuclear ages, respectively.

You probably know ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" was awakened during an atom bomb test that somehow shocked Antarctica, then made its way from the frozen north to New York, where it dies on a rollercoaster by injection from a poison isotope. The stop action monster also capsizes a ship on the way, bites a New York cop on the head and picks him up, knocks over some tall buildings while inciting mayhem, and generally creates a furor in the scientific community.

All the while, this creature (from the pre-sequel movie days) was viewed as an enemy to be feared and destroyed, never to be seen as a sympathic character out of his time and place. Everyone's goal was to identify the monster, find him and kill him. In the end, mankind was saved by slaying the dragon circa 1953.

Fast forward a half-century to the era of nuclear reactors, nuclear plants and nuclear bombs and ""Jurassic Park"" and see the difference in the way its beasts were created (by science, mad science perhaps), how they were perceived (as miracles of nature to be feared but never destroyed), and how we dealt with them (a bunch of us got eaten and we only killed them to get off the island in a pre-""Suvivor"" test). All told, these are the differences between a matinee about a monster in 1953 and a science fiction flick about dinosaurs pushing the new millennium.

I think the comparison between these films is more appropriately the contrast between the 1950s, when we had the Red Menace as our enemy, and the post-USSR but pre-9/11 era of ""Jurassic Park"", a time in the optimistic 1990s when we had no enemy to slay. I think if we'd had one when ""Jurassic Park"" came out, its creatures would have been treated like monsters and slain, too.

For ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" was not really a monster invading New York, it was Communism invading New York, just like it tried to do in another 1953 movie, ""Invasion U.S.A."" And just as surely as we put the kibosh on that enemy from 120,000 feet below the surface, we would have similarly lowered the boom on Jurassic Park's residents if they'd reared their ugly heads after 9/11.",1091836800,3,2372,4.611374407582939

For example, the 1957 Japanese film ""The Mysterians"" scared the hell out of me when I saw it in the theater.

The film starts out with an atomic test involving detonating a big boom boom the artic, giving us an opportunity to view stock footage of a lovely mushroom cloud.  Seems these test were pretty common back in the day, but wait!  Something was released from the ice...something that has been frozen in a state of suspended animation for 100 million years...and me be thinking it's a might peckish, after so many years of icy slumber.  The beast, it's a big 'un alright, is spotted by two scientists, one being Tom Nesbitt, played by Paul Hubschmid (credited in the film as Paul Christian).  The other scientist suffers an icy fate as the beast passes by, knocking into icebergs like a pregnant woman negotiating her girth around a china store, but Tom manages to escape.  No one will believe his fantastic tale of a giant monster, but soon reports of boats being attacked by a giant sea serpent along the eastern coast of North America trickle in, lending a little more credibility to Tom's story.  Who's crazy now?  Jerks...this prompts an old geezer of a paleontology professor, working with Tom, to go down in a diving bell and check out this beastie (good idea there), giving us some more stock footage of a shark attacking an octopus (which, in fact, was really, really, cool).  The gargantuan behemoth makes its' way on land, I guess to take in a show and grab a bite, and wreaks havoc among the inhabitants of New York, with all its' stepping on cars and people and smashing into buildings and such.  There's a scene around this point that's pretty famous, one involving a patrolman standing before the creature in the middle of the street, firing his handgun in an effort annoy the creature, I suppose, who, once he gets the ravenous beasts' attention, gets all ate up. ""Officer down, officer down!  We need back up!""  The army shows up with their big guns, and begins to do what they do best, shooting up the place.  Use of a heavy artillery proves effective, but opens a wound in the creature unleashes yet another threat, prehistoric cooties...yes, germs from the monster's blood has a negative effect on humans, causing illness and death.  Ooops...Well, now this is a pickle.  How to kill the beast without spreading its' germs?

I really liked the way the movie ended, tying things up nicely, linking the beginning and the end.  That's a Bradbury touch, obviously.  There are a number of really decent performances in this film, but the highlight is Harryhausen's creature, which gets quite a bit of screen time.  The story is also intelligent, but reaction of some of the characters to the situations seems a little out of whack.  I would have expected much more shock and awe, but there you go.

The print on this disc is beautiful, and there are some really great special features included.  There is a featurette called ""The Rhedosaurus and the Rollercoaster: Making the Beast"" that includes Harryhausen discussing how he brought the creature in the film to life and another featurette called ""Harryhausen & Bradbury: An Unfathomable Friendship"" which is basically the two Rays sitting before a small group talking about their professional and personal experiences with each other.  Finally there are a like four trailers to other movies Harryhausen has worked on like Clash of the Titans (1981) and The Black Scorpion (1957), among others.  On a side note, when the credits appeared at the beginning of the movie, I noticed Lee Van Cleef listed.

I really love these old black-and-white sci-fi movies from the 50's. Monster movies made today lack the kind of charm and appeal that these movies had. Expensive special effects and CGI seem to suck all the soul out of contemporary movies. Maybe my love for them stems from the fact that as a kid these movies scared the wits out of me.
Another, on a long list of movies about the after-effects of an atomic blast, this movie starts with scientists detonating an atomic bomb near the Arctic Circle. When the scientists go out to collect the data, one of them, Tom Nesbitt, sees a giant dinosaur, a mythical Rhedosaurus that apparently has been awakened by the blast and almost kills him. After a long convalescence, in which he finds no one will belive he sighted the beast, he reads in the newpaper about other incidents and sightings. After tracking down someone to corroborate his story, the fun begins.
This movie was made in 1953 with a budget of $200.000.00, a small budget for a movie even back then. The amazing thing to me about the animation in this movie is that Harryhausen did all of the stop-action himself, as he did in most of his movies. Harryhausen liked his monsters to be tragic figures, placing them in situations not of their own making, ultimately being destroyed by man who could never come to understand them. This is a trait he sometimes shared with his life-long friend, Ray  Bradbury. This is apparent when reading the original story, written by Bradbury from the Saturday Evening Post. Harryhausen probably learned some of this trait from his friend and mentor, Willis o'Brien, who animated the most tragic and misunderstood beast in all of cinema history, King Kong.
The acting in this movie is, well, it's a B movie, but the screenplay is good. The Rhedosaurus is definitley the star of this movie. The screenplay written by Lou Morrheim and Fred Freiberger is intelligent and thought provoking. The Warner Bros. DVD released in 2003 is excellent. The copy is good and the sound quality is as good as it should be. The extras on this disc complement the movie well and give some historical information that most viewers may not know.

This '52 release was so popular, that other studios decided to make their own rampaging beast.  Producer Jack Dietz was the first to jump on the bandwagon.  He independently adapted Bradbury's ""Foghorn"" into ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"". AT a raw cost of $200,000, ""Beast"" was made, with special effects by Ray Harryhausen (his first solo project). Warner Brothers bought the film from Dietz, added new music, publicized the hell out of it, and made several million dollars with this low budget monster romp.
The effects are extremely well done considering the year, and Harryhausen was on his way to surpassing stop motion innovator Willis O'Brien in terms of popularity.
""Beast"" was the surprise hit of 1953, and it in turn spawned ""Godzilla"" and ""Them"". You could say ""Beast"" paved the way for the sci-fi boom of the fifties, aided by ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""The Thing"".
If you've never seen any of the black and white ""ancient"" films, give them a try. Due to limited budgets, they often relied on ingenuity and imagination to tell their stories, and you'll be surprised by their quality.
Ray Harryhausen has become a cult figure today, more popular than ever.  He still appears at conventions and has a new book out ""An Animated Life"".
The initiated already have this movie.  Let's hope some young people are turned on to the magic of Harryhausen.",1074038400,3,1662,4.834507042253521
434061,5,630210176X,"Even if we have been treated to the more realistic dinosaurs courtesy of JURASSIC PARK et al, Ray Harryhausen's groundbreaking 1953 movie is still delightful to watch.  Released in the era when nuclear bombs were more prominently in our thoughts, the movie scolds science and yet embraces our long past as well.  Savor the joys of this classic:  the stop animation dinosaur seems real because it's well done; there is no foul language; no nudity; the hero and heroine act like high school teens of the fifties; the violence is cartoonish and never overplayed.  The monster's attack on the lighthouse is still a classic moment from our science fiction monster films.  The DVD includes an interview with Harryhausen and esteemed sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury.  Harryhausen died not long after this interview was filmed, leaving a legacy that fans of this genre will long extol.",1073692800,3,872,5.020833333333333

An atomic blast near the Arctic Circle releases a prehistoric giant trapped in ice over 100-million years. The powerful creature leaves a trail of death and destruction upon surfacing in New York City. ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" is a worthwhile landmark monster movie that honors legendary FX genius Ray Harryhausen's talents. Ray Harryhausen's impressive visual effects and Ray Bradbury's well-paced storyline set the 1953 movie apart from other classic science fiction films. Harryhausen's detailed miniatures and superb animation delivers some very amusing scenes of destruction. The massive scaly beast is a remarkable visual creation. The cast includes Paul Christian, Paula Raymond, Cecil Kallaway, Kenneth Tobey and Lee Van Cleef. ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" was a big commercial success upon theatrical release in 1953 and spawned the ""Giant Monster on the Rampage"" genre of the 1950s.

Beast from 20,000 fathoms was and still is the blueprint for all of
the giant monster on the loose films to follow (no disrespect to Willis o brien's ""Lost world"" 1925) and Ray Harryhausen
still wears the mightiest crown as the king of spx innovators even
in today's cgi domainated world. The story concerns that of an ""A""

434106,4,630210176X,"Warner Brothers pioneered talking pictures with THE JAZZ SINGER back in 1927 and they continued to set trends in THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS when they started the ""Giant monster awakened by atom bomb"" genre.
  A thermo nuclear bomb  brings a giant dinosaur (a fictional ""Rhedosaurus"" which we are told is ""the direct ancestor of [a Brontosaurus] only twice the size . . ."").  After sinking a few ships and demolishing a lighthouse the beast makes for its old hunting grounds . . .which just happens to be downtown New York City!  Ray Harryhausen's masterful animation convinces you there really is a dinosaur walking around lower Manhattan and the suspence is quite genuine.  The monster proves to be a double threat.  Not only is he invincible to modern weapons but he also carries prehistoric germs which spread a disease we have no way of coping with.
  Paul Christian (a German actor whose real name was Paul Hubschmidt) is the hero, Paula Corday (who would go on to appear opposite John Agar in HAND OF DEATH) is the heroine and lovable Cecil Kellaway (THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS, 1940) is the venerable old scientist.  Kenneth Tobey (THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD) represents the military and watch for Lee Van Cleef in an early role as a sharpshooter.

434107,5,630210176X,"Consonant with Everything Atomic in the 1950s, this great monster film bought into the vision completely.  When a prehistoric reptile suddenly emerges to wreak havoc on civilization, conventional weapons (tanks and so forth) are ineffective, so they must kick it up a notch.
Having seen this film as a kid, I watched it again in college with a friend who majored in nuclear engineering.  At the point in the movie where everyone realizes that ordinary munitions won't kill the beast, and they turned to a scientist who said, ""There's only one thing that will work in a situation like this:  RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES,"" my nuclear friend nearly choked laughing at this Hollywood-concocted absurdity.
It's doubtful, with contemporary special effects, that today's kids would find this movie appealing.  But for all the boomers who grew up with this sort of thing, it's an eminently enjoyable classic.",1053475200,,893,5.180555555555555
434108,5,630210176X,"Special effects by the legendary Ray Harryhausen and a story by popular science fiction author Ray Bradburry... this was destined to become a sci-fi classic. This was the first, and probably best, in the long line of prehistoric monster movies that followed and became part of sci-fi film history in the process.

The plot begins as a nuclear scientist sees his partner killed by a giant, prehistoric creature while monitoring an atomic blast near the north pole. Naturally, nobody believes him until a paleontologist, played by Paula Raymond, helps him link several sea and beach disasters (I particularly enjoyed the attack made by the creature on a lighthouse) to the beast and prove there is a real monster on the loose. Finally, the animal surfaces at the NYC docks near Wall Street, destroying buildings, cars and people in his wake. After more mayhem and the discovery of a mysterious disease the animal carries which won't permit it to be destroyed by conventional weapons, the creature meets it's fate when it's cornered within the old Coney Island rollercoaster.

This film is exceptional primarily due to the genius of Ray Harryhausen. His special effects in this film are outstanding, especially when you consider this film was made in 1953 on a budget that wouldn't pay the cost of one days electric bill on most movie shoots these days. The scenes where the creature has been awakened by the arctic atomic test and his (or is it a her?) journey back to it's prehistoric breeding grounds off the mouth of the Hudson River are superb. The intensity of the action never stops and has seldom been equalled. It begins with the opening scenes in the snowy arctic, continues with attacks on several fishing boats, the lighthouse and reaches a highlight when the creature comes ashore in New York City. We're even treated to a live action fight between a shark and an octopus, at least until the beast appears looking for lunch! Also, the acting by the stories human characters is excellent as well. Most of the actors (like Kenneth Tobey) will be recoginzed from other classic horror/sci-fi films of the period.

If you're looking for a real blast from the past and a movie considered by many (myself included) to be the best ""prehistoric monster on the loose"" flick ever made, you can't go wrong with The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.",1041811200,34,2339,4.857142857142857

434110,4,630210176X,"This is a movie that misses a five star rating because of wasted opportunities.
One such example involves the romance between Paul Christian and Paula Raymond. There is a lot of chemistry between the two actors. The dialogue and admiring looks they give each other are so well executed,its easy to believe they could have had an off-screen romance. But once the Beast begins his assault on New York City the relationship inexplicably goes out the window. Usually,when I do a 50's sci-fi review,I mention the love affair involving the two main characters. Now,I could care less whether theres a romance in these films or not. After all,thats not what these movies are about. But if you're going to include it in the script then FOLLOW THROUGH with it;otherwise your just wasting the viewers time.
Another wasted opportunity comes at the end of the film when for some reason the Beast goes to the park and decides to hang out at the roller-coaster while the humans prepare to destroy him. Instead of rampaging like any self-respecting monster would be doing,it just paces back and forth giving the humans ample time to prepare their weapon,ride to the top of the coaster and shoot it in the throat,putting the Beast out of its misery.
Despite the time I spent on these two points,these are actually minor quibbles. Because the real star of this film is Ray Harryhausens' spfx.
The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was how Ray used darkness to such great effect. He uses it to hide what the creature looks like until the incredibly exciting attack on NYC.(You actually get a pretty good look at the monster towards the beginning,during the blizzard. But I don't think Ray intended the Beast to be that visible.)Then,after the initial attack on the city,the army battles the creature at night near power lines. As the Beast thrashes against the wires the screen begins to flash like a strobe light. It is highly imaginative and is my favorite scene in the film.
