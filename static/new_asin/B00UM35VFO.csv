8707370,1,B00UM35VFO,"Save your money. I watched this nearly 3 hour long dvd with my partner and found very little actionable advice. Basically, the advice summed up is calm your child down before redirecting their behavior. For specific examples of how to work with little kids, read How to Talk to Kids and Listen So that Kids Will Want to Talk.",1529280000,,325,4.52542372881356

8707372,5,B00UM35VFO,"Watching this DVD was a great alternative to attending a parenting class. Of course is not a fun Hollywood movie, it's basically a parenting class in your living room. The information there was very useful and my husband found it engaging and interesting too. A lot of science based parenting information. We have watched it twice and probably will again when we feel we forgot the tips given. We watched it in 30-60 minutes or by chapters. It is also a great alternative to reading the books, for those who prefer video than reading. I work with parents and I often recommend it to them.",1473638400,,588,4.609523809523809
8707373,1,B00UM35VFO,"I bought this because the book was good, a video on their website was engaging, and my husband wouldn't read the book but would watch a video. Do not waste your money. We couldn't even finish it due to boredom. This is a poorly recorded, confusing and hard to hear recording of a talk given by the authors. It doesn't flow nicely like the book, it's just like sitting in a bad lecture in college.  I expected something engaging, not just a recorded lecture. I also expected something that looked like it was recorded in the 2010s not something that looks like it was recorded in 1980. It is just a video of the two authors standing in front of a room talking. Nothing else. A few banners of ""chapters"" pop up at the bottom, but there aren't even useful visuals. I'm so disappointed, I really wanted this to be helpful. Perhaps we'll try an Audible version of the book instead.",1451692800,3,876,4.440993788819876
