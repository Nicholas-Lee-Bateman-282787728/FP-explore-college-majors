1404120,5,B000058CB6,"Premise(As displayed on Ringu Box"":
""Within a week of watching a mysterious videotape, a group of teenagers are dead. The bodies are found gruesomely contorted, their eyes frozen as if they had seen something more terrifying than any physical threat. The video becomes an urban myth. Insidiously, an unseen force is pointing its deadly finger at those poor souls unable to resist their curiosity. One of those people is the cynical journalist, Reiko, who soon finds herself unwillingly drawn into a spiralling nightmare from an unseen, omnipresent threat. The most unsettling film since the Exorcist, with an unnatural presence that touches every nerve in your body, Ringu is a beast of an entirely different order. Critically acclaimed as one of the most frightening horror films in years, Ringu delivers a tense spine-chilling atmosphere, filled with an overwhelming sense of dread and a potent presence of unworldly evil. Dark, sinister and genuinely horrifying, this is a film you will never forget.""- Ringu cover
My Review:
For those who have seen the ring, and really liked it, this movie is a real treat! While The Ring was a more ""Real"" movie(meaning that it is almost a possibilty of something that is not too far off from real life) Ringu is very ""Unreal""(It goes very ESP style pshycic) it is overall scarier than the ring however not as enjoyable once you have already seen it. This movie is based on the book: Ringu by Koji Suzuki.
Both movies however are good, and entertaing, and both have the same moral to the story:
Curiosity killed the Cat.",1043107200,48,1559,4.931558935361217
1404121,1,B000058CB6,"I've probably watched more horror films than most people.  Time and time again I'm disappointed in how bad most of them are.  There have been a few recent exceptions including The Others and Frailty, but for the most part horror has been awful.  I was incredibly impressed with The Ring.  Sure, it has a few lose ends, but for pure creep-factor, it ranks up there among the best horror films I've ever seen.  After seing The Ring three times, I managed to secure bootlegs of the original Ringu trilogy.  Boy, are these ever awful!  Kudos to whoever was able to look at these and create The Ring from them.  The original Japanease films are virtually unwatchable (especially the 2 sequels).  Do yourself a favor and avoid these at all cost!  The film that's supposed to kill you in the original Ringu lasts for about 25 seconds and is totally lame.  The reporter figures everything out incredibly quickly.  The only good part is the creepy ending, which was done much better in the remake.  See the remake, skip the original.",1042761600,4,1024,4.653631284916201

The story in this film is great. This isn't an over-the-top horror film filled with jump-scares, this film uses effective subtle-like horror to create a haunting atmosphere. A real slow-burn with great immersion from beginning to end. The actual tape in this film has a very realistic, and, in turn, a very unsettling vibe. The concept of a cursed tape is creative and terrifying, even if you've never used a VHS. The film has an amazing scene towards the end that I won't spoil, but it really is incredibly effective; the actual ending, however, felt very abrupt and rushed. The acting was great overall, there was a scene or two that felt a bit clich&eacute;/over-the-top. I also really enjoyed the music, it really added to the film's atmosphere.

1404128,5,B000058CB6,"Ringu is a story about stories--the way they start, how they grow and change, their power over us.

The protagonist, Reiko Asakawa [Nanako Matsashima] is a journalist who only gets assigned ""fluff"" stories because she is a single mother, divorced from Takashi Yakamura [Yoichi Numata]. She's given a feature piece on ""the video curse,"" a tale that is traveling from schoolchild to schoolchild. It seems to have something to do with a frightening woman who appears on television late at night, a phone call, and dying a week later. Nothing more than an urban legend, but entertaining.

Until Reiko's niece and three of her friends all die on the same night, having watched a strange video. Now more intensely focused on the story, Reiko retraces her niece's movements until she arrives at a motel where the 4 teenagers stayed. There she finds a videocassette in a plain white box. With the help of her ex-husband, who is psychic, Reiko tries to piece together the story of the video and the story on the video. But only after she, her ex-husband, and her son have watched the tape--will there be enough time to save them all?

Ringu won 6 nominations and 5 awards, and with good reason. There are many stories in Ringu--the spine of the movie itself, the tale of past love between Reiko and Takashi, the story of the video and the story on the video. They intertwine to create a commentary on the power of a tale to keep us awake at night, listening for the scrabbling claws, to feel an intense need to share our stories, to retell them again and again, to take on a life of their own.",1287532800,,1584,4.590106007067138

[Ringu]

(Japan - 1998)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SR

A TV journalist (Nanako Matsushima) joins forces with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to trace the source of a strange videotape which brings death to anyone who watches it...

Hugely successful on its home turf, Hideo Nakata's cult favorite (based on a novel by Kji Suzuki) ignited a worldwide interest in supernatural horror movies (consolidated a year later by the international success of THE SIXTH SENSE) and spawned a wave of sequels and spin-offs, many of which have since been optioned and/or remade by US studios.

On its own terms, however, RING is a huge disappointment. Things get off to a bad start with the opening teaser, a slow-burning 'scare' scene which builds toward nothing more than a lacklustre freeze-frame, ruining the intended effect, and the subsequent narrative relies too heavily on mood to be truly effective. Nakata generates tension through a gradual accumulation of details, as Matsushima and Sanada follow a series of clues to a remote island where they uncover the identity of a 'character' in the cursed video, whose restless spirit seeks vengeance for a past transgression. The movie closes on a scene of stunning, visceral horror (impressionable viewers are warned that this sequence is PROFOUNDLY frightening), but it's the only highlight of an otherwise mediocre movie. Nakata has since built a career on such material (CHAOS, DARK WATER, etc.).

Followed by RING 2 (1999) and the tangentially-related THE SPIRAL (1998).",1255132800,,1551,5.284552845528455
1404131,4,B000058CB6,"I watched Ringu first. Then watched The Ring. After about half an hour into The Ring, it was pretty clear it was going to be a trainwreck compared to Ringu.

Ringu had a much more creepy feel to it. It wasn't overdone at all, it left much more to the imagination, and was much more dramatic than The Ring (like, for example, in Ringu, when the protagonist answers the phone, she hears the same sounds heard on the tape, and slams the phone down, while in The Ring, a cliche' voice says, ""You have seven days"" and then she just puts the phone down; the faces of the victims are scarier in Ringu, partly because they're not clearly overdone makeup). The tape in The Ring was too long and seemed like someone just randomly put together a sequence just for shock value, while in Ringu it was short and sweet, was genuinely creepy, and it looked like something that could have come from beyond the grave. To be really honest, I got kind of bored with the tape in The Ring.

The boy in Ringu also has a much creepier feel about him, the fact that he almost never opens his mouth adds to the creepiness of the whole movie, while in The Ring he seems to be a pretty major character and talks quite a lot, which detracted.

The one nice thing in The Ring was the sequence with the horse running through the ferry, but that had to be spoiled (by the way, there's no way that ever happened, because it's common knowledge not to start instigating a horse in a trailer).

There are two main issues with The Ring: (1) You kind of don't care if the whole cast lives or dies, while in Ringu one was very much routing for the protagonist, her son, and even her ex-husband, and (2) The Ring relies heavily on shock value and drags when there isn't any shock value, while Ringu just creeped under your skin and didn't drive it into the ground.",1247529600,,1824,4.309037900874635

1404134,5,B000058CB6,"Back in 2002, I saw ""The Ring"" before I saw ""Ringu."" At first, I was scared s***less when I saw ""The Ring"", but then after a few repeated viewings, it started to grow dull. Then, I saw ""Ringu"" two years ago, and I must say that the original Japanese version is the better one. In ""The Ring"" there are some over-the-top imagery, and some loud sound effects in order for us to ""jump"". But here in ""Ringu"", it's all very quiet, and very eerie. I guess what works here is that the slow pacing actually hightens the tension much more so. And the cursed videotape is much shorter (only about forty seconds), but the images are far more effective. And let's not forget Sadako. She's far more frightening than Samara: to me, little kids ruin modern horror films. And the way she attacks her victims is absolutely terrifying.

If I had to choose, then I would go for ""Ringu."" Sure, ""The Ring"" had more special effects and more ""jump"" scenes, but ""Ringu"" works for its simplicity and its silent eerieness.

1404139,4,B000058CB6,"When I saw the The Ring, I enjoyed it, but was also unsatisfied. The contents of the mysterious tape seemed arbitrary to me, and the randomly arranged images didn't make sense (my litmus test for anything that falls into the speculative range of fiction or film). When I saw Ringu, I understood much better. A little internet research on Japanese ghost stories was also helpful. Japanese ghosts are called yrei, and there are subgroups within. Specific to this movie is the subgroup onry - ghosts that are bound to the material word to avenge a wrong done to them while they were alive.

In Ringu, the contents of the tape are very specific, and each segment is relevant to something that happens, or has happened, in the story arc (the arc reaching well back in time). Most important, of course, was the discovery made by Asakawa (the reporter) regarding what I thought were floating letters, or moveable type. In reality, it was a newspaper article, and spoke of an eruption of a volcano on Oshima Island foretold by Sadako's mother, Shizuko. This article is what leads Asakawa and her ex-husband, Ryuji (who, in the book, I understand, was only her friend) to go to Oshima.

(I'm going to forego initial plot summations, and assume that most either have read such summaries or are familiar enough that it's not necessary.)

While on Oshima, Ryuji confronts Dr. Ikuma, and they speak of Shizuko's paranormal abilities and her sadness. Ryuji acknowledges having similar talents, and indeed, when he grasps the wrist of a fallen Dr. Ikuma, he sees Shizuko's ESP experiment where the reporters gathered called her a fraud, and one reporter died, with the same look of fear and horror that everyone else who has died after seeing the tape. Asakawa also witnesses this, though I don't know quite how that was managed, and after the reporter fell to his death, she witnessed a young girl in a white dress with long black hair running away. Shizuko shouted out after the girl - ""Sadako!""

The white dress and long black hair are also important to Japanese ghost stories. White is (was?) the traditional funeral garb in Japan, and the unkempt black hair comes from Kabuki theater wear characters where different style wigs to identify themselves to the audience.

I found Ryuji's paranormal abilities too convenient. I mean, come on. A reporter is investigating deaths of teens that watched a tape. Her niece was one of them. Her ex-husband just happens to be one of the few people that can help lead her to the answers she *thinks* she needs. I like things wrapped up a little tighter than that. Coincidence does not a convincing film make.

(Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.)

Another thing that bothered me was the scene at the well. To assume that they needed to go back to the cabin where the first teens viewed the tape was a bit of a leap. Not much - I can accept that leap given the reasons Asakawa supplied, but it was still a bit of a leap, especially after accepting the leap of Ryuji's abilities. Also, they have assumed that to ""rescue"" Sadako's corpse from the well will quiet her, and end her vengeance. I admit to lacking a great familiarity with Japanese ghost stories, or Japanese horror, but even if we accept that this is something accepted as generally understood, then there's this: First, why was Ryuji in the bottom of the well *first*, forcing Asakawa (much thinner, frailer, weaker) to be the one to pull up the heavy buckets of water; Second, and far more important, why didn't Ryuji just kick around and try to find the corpse by himself? When he lowered himself to the bottom of the well, he was able to stand fully erect. It was a small well. One or two soft nudges with his foot would have found the corpse. As disgusting as it sounds, he could have closed his eyes, dived down in the shallow water, and come up with Sadako's skeleton.

It could be argued that I'm demanding something from J-horror that it will never provide because it doesn't want to: common sense. That's fine. But a bit more effort and I'll bet the filmmakers could have come up with something to tie everything up a bit neater, and made it a better film. But I'm not complaining, as much as it may seem like it. I enjoyed the film immensely. It was my first experience to non-Hollywood horror, and the lack of black cats was almost enough to make this a five star experience. Indeed, there was very little of anything to frighten us in this movie, other than the atmosphere created by the events. When you watch a movie that can do that to you, you're watching a good movie.

It's odd to note that the American film tried to make a more cohesive story, and one that didn't rely on what I'm terming coincidence, but instead created something more confusing. The only thing I preferred in the American version was the ""final TV scene"". When I saw that in the theater, that was seriously creepy. It's been quite a while since anything made me squirm.",1176422400,4,4960,4.627272727272727

The story is uncomplicated and comes with a lovely ending. The heroine, Nanako Matshushima is not only pretty but speaks beautiful Japanese. So much the better instead of listening to some poor English dubbing. The lovely piano tunes in the movie reminded me of Vangelis in his heydays.

1404142,4,B000058CB6,"There are many varied opinions between the two Ring films. ""Ringu"" released in 1998, and its American counterpart ""The Ring,"" starring Naomi Watts have their favorites, depending on whether or not one viewed the first one from Japan first, or viewed the American version first. For most Americans it was the latter. However, I liked them both. And yet, I can understand why many in the USA would prefer the American version over the Japanese film. Since I liked them both, it is difficult for me to prefer one over the other.

Moreover, they both have their own distinctive styles when it comes to the nuances of horror. I have always felt that the Japanese were superior to this than American film-makers were; as the gore and violence are part and parcel of American horror films. On the other hand, having seen my fair share of Japanese horror films over the past 40 odd years, I would have to say that Japanese film-makers can put just as much gore into a film as American film-makers. The film ""Ringu"" was directed by Hideo Nakata, and I believe he did an excellent job with this particular film.

I have never read the book the film is based on, therefore, unlike some of the other reviewers I cannont comment on how the film and book correspond. However, for those who have not seen the film ""Ringu,"" give it a chance. You might find that you like it. Moreover, this would give you a good chance to compare the two films, and see firsthand how the Japanese and American directors and screen writers differ on what they feel are shocking to their audiences. Plus, you get to compare the cinematography of the two films. What is similar? What differs?

One of the great things I like about Japanese horror films today is that they are different, some good, some not, but they are definitely different in style than their American counterparts. Also, it is important that films be viewed in their own languange with subtitles. You REALLY get more out of the inflections of the characters than if they were speaking in English. There was a time when I was younger that if you watched a Japanese film on television, odds were that it was not subtitled or in Japanese. And the English translations were horrid. Having seen great Japanese films at the theatres, and then the occassional viewing on TV, this made for one terrible viewing. Anyway, enjoy the film it is worth your watch. And if you happen to like the US version better, that's ok, because it's a good film too! [Stars: 4.5]",1169596800,3,2487,4.622171945701357
1404143,4,B000058CB6,"""Ringu"" came out back in 1998 and caused quite a stir. It's really the film that kicked off the run of Asian horror movies that have since garnered a massive following and become the inspiration for umpteen American remakes. I think I'm one of the fortunate ones that picked up on the sensation early enough and saw ""Ringu"" long before the remake was released. Those who watch them in reverse order may be a little disappointed as they simply lose out on the effect that this unique (at the time) experience held. I'm not suggesting that ""Ringu"" isn't worth viewing. It just has flaws that the creators of the remake were generally able to rectify and having the knowledge of what happens at the end definitely takes away from the result.

The plot involves a videotape containing bizarre and creepy imagery. When someone watches the tape, they immediately receive a phone call and the countdown begins. They will die in seven days! The reasons for this are completely unclear for the majority of the film, but the main characters (who are attempting to save their own lives after watching the tape) slowly unravel the mystery to discover who is behind the curse and why. When I first heard this plot I thought it was stupid. Describing it to friends that haven't seen it still gets the same response. Yet ""Ringu"" is convincing enough to really get under your skin. The tape really is creepy for starters! It's far shorter than in the remake, yet the combination of grating sounds and atmospheric visuals that you just can't quite figure out works really well. The music in the film is minimal to say the least and it really only kicks in when something scary or important occurs. It's certainly not utilized for shock value like in so many American movies these days which is a breath of fresh air. Without a doubt though, it's the shocking finale that the viewer will never forget. I nearly soiled myself on first viewing and I consider myself to be a fairly difficult person to scare.

As for which version is better, well in most cases I find remakes fairly pointless exercises and nearly always disappointing. Yet ""The Ring"" is in my opinion far superior to ""Ringu"" for the following reasons. The acting is much better, the story doesn't rely on one of the main characters being able to read minds to unravel, and there's a whole heap of new background information on the characters involved. But even with all these flaws, I still really enjoy ""Ringu"" and suggest fans of the remake check it out to see where the whole thing started. If you haven't seen either, I highly recommend watching the Japanese version first for full appreciation.",1162512000,6,2645,4.7105831533477325

Tastefully done and artfully crafted these are tales ultimately of woe and horror that beget all who come across the 'cursed video', in true asian style you will see lots of dark hair and half seen shadows in what became I think the gateway for many more world horror films to come through - welcome Sedako into your house - but beware, you have 7 days left to live!",1142553600,3,766,4.168918918918919
1404147,4,B000058CB6,"Like probably most of the people out there who've seen this film, I actually saw the American remake first.  Personally, I prefer the American version, but the pairing of the two shows why remaking films can sometimes work out-- The existence of one film doesn't make the other one obsolete.  They both work in their own way.  Both are atmospheric horror films, but the remake is flashy and gaudy, whereas the original is far more sedate and generally lacked the motifs that defined the style of the remake. (i.e. water, horses, circles, the tree and a general emphasis on multiple meanings)  Again, I think the former approach is more effective, overall, but both are definitely valid.  I like the stylishness of the remake, but 'Ringu' proves that the core story and concepts are plenty powerful on their own.

This film was really made on the cheap, only a little over a million bucks, I hear.  This makes it have a bleak, stark quality to it as it has little flash and the scenes are often poorly lit.  Still, despite the low budget the seams never quite tear apart, as they so often do in low-budget stuff. (See the climax of Nakata's later 'Dark Water'.)  The tape itself is fairly haunting, and the climax is exceedingly well done.  The low budget is perhaps an asset there, as it forces ingenuity and keeps you from getting to fancy or elaborate.  That, and the prominent imagery of that climactic scene is quite unforgettable, and it's easy to see why it caused such wide spread impact in Asian horror films over the next couple years.  In the end, the impact of the film comes down to some intangible things. It just has such an oppressive, bleak mood to it, though it's tough to say specifically where it comes from.  The film doesn't have very many out and out scare scenes, but it maintains an intensity thru out it all.  This music is quite effective, largely just a lot of atonal rumbling.  Nakata probably tries a little too hard with the sound at a few points, but it's definitely effective overall.

The film does have a few concerns.  The two protagonists, Asakawa and Ryuji are fairly faceless and uninteresting.  (This is an aspect where the remake improves on the original, as Noah is quite likable which helps in general, and particularly adds impact to the final scenes.)  Now, having likable characters is not usually a huge concern in horror films, but here we actually follow to particular figures a lot more closely than we usually would, but we don't really find out all that much about them.  Also, I think the film perhaps tips its hand a little too early and some of the explainations are a bit too mundane.  Finally, there is a prominent flashback scene that occurs about an hour into the film which just doesn't quite work.  I think it's a bit silly. (I know I'm being vague, but I don't wanna spoil anything for those who haven't seen it.)

Anyway, this is a fairly haunting film.  Not terrifying, but unsettling.  If you haven't seen any of the major Asian horror films of recent years, this is as good a place to start as any.

1404148,5,B000058CB6,"Everyone has heard of ""The Ring,"" a terrifying horror movie starring Naomi Watts. But before there was that film, there was ""Ringu,"" a hair-raising ghost story where something as insignificant as a videotape can kill.

Four teenagers have died mysteriously, and another has gone mad. After finding that her niece was literally scared to death, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) begins investigating the cabin where the four kids stayed. There she finds a strange videotape full of bizarre images. Then the phone rings. It fits the profile of the ""cursed video"" that has been circulating, which will kill the watcher after seven days.

Reiko is understandably terrified -- especially when her young son also watches it. She calls in her ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who initially discounts her fears. But soon he begins to believe as well, and assists Reiko in investigating the origins of the tape, and the strange images on it. They find that the source of it is a young girl with monstrous psychic powers, who was murdered thirty years ago...

""Ringu"" has become one of those rare films that are frequently ripped off (especially in Asian cinema), referenced, and remade (especially in Hollywood). Crawling ghosts with long drippy hair, slow-acting curses and all that.

But as we all know, the first is usually the best. There aren't any masked slashers or bloody bodies in this. Instead, there is an everyday item that happens to be cursed, and a jerky-limbed girl who can kill with a thought -- and even death can't stop her. (Interestingly, Sadako and her mother were based on real people)

Hideo Nakata did a magnificent job with a film that could have been incredibly tedious; much of ""Ringu"" is detective work, with the ghoulish Sadako only entering the picture at the end. Instead, it has suspense. Colours are muted, and the plot grows more taut and claustrophobic as the characters try to beat the clock. And the end is a terrifying twist that can't be seen in advance -- but which leaves us wondering what we would do in that situation.

Matsushima and Sanada are excellent leads for this movie; not only do they have excellent chemistry, but they seem like a plausible pair of exes. Reiko is played as a strong, smart woman who desperately wants to save her son, while Ryuji is insensitive and rather brusque, but cares as much for Reiko as he seems capable of.

With a quietly taut storyline and a terrifying demon-spawn villain, ""Ringu"" strips horror down to its bare bones, and lets the ordinary scare us silly. Outstanding.",1131235200,3,2548,4.897911832946636
1404149,4,B000058CB6,I saw Ringu before I saw the Ring. I thought this was very scary. I thought it was a lot more scarier than the Ring. Sadakao and her evil is more evident in this film. IF you enjoy Japanese horror this is the perfect film for a Friday night.,1124928000,5,241,3.938775510204082
1404150,5,B000058CB6,"The core difference between Koji Suzuki's book and this film is the decision to use a woman lead - Nanako Matsushima as Reiko Asakawa, a newspaper woman.  Screenplay writer Hiroshi Takahashi then introduces her ex-husband, Koichi (Katsimi Muramatsu) as the other lead.  The film gains considerable intensity as a result of the relationship between the two in their efforts to save themselves and their young son Yoichi (Takashi Yamamura).

The primary plot device, a video tape which contains a series of mystical sequences and clues.  Watching it brings on a mysterious curse that kills in exactly seven days.  Reiko and Koichi must peel back layer after layer of mystery in an effort to discover why a resort hotel always seems to have a copy of this tape on hand.  And why a volcanic eruption 40 years before has triggered a string of horrible deaths.

While the film differs in many places from the book it has an immediacy and vividness that the book, with its procedural narration, seemed to lack.  This happens slowly, and the initial scenes of the film after the opening death of the first high school student drag a bit.  Director Hideo Nakata uses a light touch, depending on expressions and lighting to create horror rather than violence and gore.  There are still plenty of jarring moments, though.

The book, however, does better with the motivations behind the tape, which the film leaves somewhat vague.  Of course, the story depends on the somewhat arbitrary nature of the evil behind the tape for its uneasiness.  The acting, by the way, completely overcomes the dubbing.  You often will know what is going on without any reference to the text.

This is as close to an artistic Japanese horror film as I've seen.  The cinematography is subtle in effect, but with powerful use of shadow in a variety of settings.  Quite by accident, I'm following this story from book to Japanese film (and next the US film), and the way Hideo Nakata chose to capture the book is quite eye opening.  Definitely a must see.",1124323200,13,2021,4.808695652173913
1404151,5,B000058CB6,"It's well known that Japan is several years ahead of the USA as far as technology, and as seen Lost in Translation, the wave of mass communication leads to absurdity.

Ringu acts on the same premise but in a very different way. As you probably know from the American remake, it's about a reporter who stumbles across a videotape that kills all who watch it. The remake was a good movie, but it just didn't inspire the same primal emotions or incorporate the same wit as the original.

This film is as smart as George Romero's Dawn of the Dead and as scary as Silence of the Lambs. Televisions and telephones create an ominous presence whenever appearing in a scene. The TVs are a personification of evil as effective as Hannibal Lector. After seeing the film, I actually had slight nightmares about being attacked by my TV.

The mass influx of news stories in different versions lead to the depletion of information overall. The main characters struggle, even the psychic, to discover the truth about the tapes origins within the week they have left. Rumors seem true, then false, then turn out true, and no one knows who to believe.

In a world where mass hysteria stems from overloaded misinformation, we are forced to ask ourselves, should I pass that chain letter and condemn the recipient to its consequences, or should I sacrifice myself to end it. This is a film that understands, as all great horror films do, that the greatest terrors lie within.",1122249600,6,1455,4.694117647058824
1404152,3,B000058CB6,"You know when you have watched too many horror movies when your friends are cringing in terror and all you can do is yawn. While Ring, a blockbuster success in Japan, does deliver some chills (especially to those who can get scared easily), it is ultimately disappointing.

The movie starts off very well, with a girl who tells her friend about a videotape she had watched a week ago. In it were some disturbing (not gory) images then a phone call at the end of it. The phone call indicated that she was going to die at the end of the week. In the movie, this premise is an urban legend that they brush off, but as the girl goes downstairs, the TV suddenly turns on and she found dead the next morning. It is the second most chilling scene in the movie and sets the tone. The next day, a reporter, covering the case finds out about the legend and begins a search for the tape. She finds it and she is given the same call. In one week, she is going to die. Of course, she won't take it lying down, so she enlists her ex-husband and they begin researching the history of the tape.

The actual investigation takes 80% of the movie and it is non too exciting to watch. We do get a sense of dread as each day is counted, and the investigation itself is interesting, in a Changeling, sort of way, but many things pop up that begin to throw water on the flame we call reality. We learn that her husband is suddenly Psychic and this psychic allows the reporter to magically appear in scenes that happened years ago, a la Mummy Returns. However, the background story in and of itself is fairly boring and there are little twists and turns. It is more interesting when they dissect the videotape for evidence and clues.

The last day (the movie is broken over a period of 7 days) is the most terrifying, due to self-motivated fear. We all know what is going to happen at 7:00 p.m. and as the main characters become more frantic in their actions to find a solution, the viewer also shares in the sense of despiration. When the phenomenon finally happens, it is a scene right out of a 1980's Lamberto Bava movie, but much better done. It is scary scene that caused several people in our viewing audience (both ladies and one guy) to gasp. It is a well crafted scene. However, the ending of the movie is poorly done. How does the reporter figure out the answer? There could have been 100 different answers to why she was spared, but of course she knows the right one.

Anyway, the fear that eminates from this movie is like that of the Blair Witch Project. It is self-created and those who are fearless when watching horror movies may not be too impressed. However, all my friends who watched the movie said it was scary as heck, so hence my recommendation for the casual horror movie lover....Rating: B-",1120694400,2,2791,4.382239382239383
1404153,3,B000058CB6,"Ringu was a big disappointment.  After seeing ""The Ring"", I was interested to view the original, having heard that it was twice as creepy.  Wrong.  Unlike the Americanized version, there is little to no character development.  The plot is linear and over simplified.  The ""terrifying"" little girl is merely poorly groomed.

Here, the son is virtually ignored, unlike in ""The Ring"", where he provides the most chilling events of the film.  Ringu's ex-husband/father character has some ridiculous psychic abilities that are used to give the viewer some insight into the motivations behind the spooky little girl.  This was handled much better in the American version, where these things are found out through journalistic investigation (the heroine is a reporter, for goodness sake) and confrontation of the girls' father.  And the ending of ""The Ring"" is much more cold-blooded and fits the story line far better.

Aside from ""The Shining"", ""The Ring"" is still the scariest movie I've ever seen.  ""Ringu"" comes off as little more than a well-intentioned high school play.  It just proves what I always say - America's #1.",1120608000,,1120,5.12707182320442

1404156,1,B000058CB6,"Ringu sucks.  I'm really, really sorry.  It does.  It's boring, uninteresting, has little, if any, character development, and delivers no creepiness or scares.  The acting is wooden, one character reveals his powerful psychic powers (which would have been hella useful earlier!) in the middle of the movie for no apparent reason, deus ex machina style.  Then they're never referred to again.  That's not just bad writing, it's silly.  Everybody raves about this movie like it's actually frightening, or at least somewhat creepy.  I had a hard time making out any plot whatsoever, and the ""big scary part!"" is a snore.  And I'm sorry to burst more bubbles here, but the soggy chick with rolled back eyes is not scary at all.  It's not even remotely creepy.  It was actually painful to watch, but only because I had to reconcile myself with the fact that Japan is so absolutely in love with this garbage.

There was one redeeming quality to this film - the scene where Sadako is clubbed and thrown into the well.  It is absolutely hysterical!  Initially, we see a still shot of Sadako standing like an idiot staring down a well.  Out of nowhere, Sadako's mother runs full-tilt into frame with a 2x4 or something and whacks her daughter over the head.  The sound effect used at that moment is the funniest thing I have ever heard in a movie.  ""THWACK!""  Now that's comedy!  I couldn't stop laughing when I saw that.  I'm certain it wasn't meant to be funny, either, which only makes it funnier in my opinion.

This movie is trash.  It's a complete trainwreck that all Japanese teenagers agreed to think was cool simultaneously, en masse, which is basically how Japanese pop-culture is directed these days.  I dare you to find niche films in Japan.  Heck, independant music taste is even harder.  There's a reason ""idoru"" (meaning ""idol"") is a term in Japan.  Everybody decides that something is awesome, and then as soon as the next awesome thing comes along they drop the old one and flock to the new.  Ringu is like that, the latest awesome thing in horror films.

The American version of this film is EVEN WORSE.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1110931200,4,2142,4.69811320754717
1404157,4,B000058CB6,"""Ringu"" is a supernatural thriller based on Koji Suzuki's novel of the same name. This film adaptation has spawned two Japanese sequels and an American remake, with more to come, and was a seminal work in the ongoing Asian horror film craze that began in the late 1990s. ""Ringu"" is more a paranormal mystery than a horror film, though. It's not even remotely a splatter film, so those who like creepy but don't like blood may enjoy it.

A story about a cursed video is making the rounds of high schools. Supposedly, anyone who watches it dies one week later. The video has become the stuff of urban legend. A reporter, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), who is investigating the rumors, intensifies her research when she learns that a young relative of hers has died mysteriously after seeing the legendary video. In the course of her investigation, Reiko watches the video and begins to fear for her own life and that of her young son. She enlists the help of her ex-husband, Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), in analyzing the cryptic film. Together, they race against the clock, searching for clues to the video's origin.

""Ringu"" is spooky rather than scary. It sometimes relies on gimmicks -such as the expiration date placed on anyone who sees the video- and on inconsistencies to move the story forward. It's not sophisticated. But the characters are likable. And ""Ringu"" succeeds in engaging the audience's interest in discovering the mysteries of the video. The film has a slow middle section, when Reiko and Ryuji are analyzing the tape. But the tedium lends the story a  bit of realism, so may actually help create a sense of plausibility. ""Ringu"" recycles elements from other films and books, but it does a pretty good job of it. It's not innovative, but ""Ringu"" is an entertaining thriller with an attractive cast.

This is the Japanese predecessor to the Ring here in the states.  I had just watched Ju-on and had this one as well.  I felt it wasn't quite the film that Ring would become.  It lacked the visceral terror, creepy atmosphere, and production values of the Ring.  Still taken on its own it's fairly effective, although again I didn't even enjoy it as much as Ju-on.  I think in the US version the mystery was handled with more panache instead of exposition by a `psychic' boyfriend who explains the girls power in a lump sum finish up ending.  I also preferred the grainy, monochromatic gloom of the Ring locales vs Ringu.  Ah well, still somewhat entertaining to watch.",1107734400,2,728,4.5038167938931295
1404160,5,B000058CB6,"The first theatrical version of Koji Suzuki's novel, as there was Ringu Kanzenban, a 1995 TV movie, is the one that inspired two Japanese sequels, a prequel, the South Korean version, Ring Virus, and oh yes, the pitiful American version with Naomi Watts.  Needless to say, Ringu stands head above them.

The story's well-told by now, but let me relate it one more time.  Following the death of her niece, high school student Tomoko, Reiko Asakawa, a journalist, investigates the cause.  Seems like there's a cursed video that'll kill someone within a week of that person watching it.  As a cute high school student tells her in a videocamera interview, ""I heard that suddenly, there's this scary woman who says, `you'll die in one week.""  Well, in the opening moments of the movie, Tomoko tells her friend Masami that she and her friends saw a weird video while vacationing at Izu Pacific Island.  It turns out that Tomoko's vacationing friends also died on the exact same day and time as her, and that one of the girls died with the same look of sheer shock that Tomoko did.

Reiko goes to the same resort, discovers a video in a nondescript blank case, watches it, and, well, gets the curse.  The imagery of the video has a surreal yet eerie look, the woman combing her hair, the man with white cloth on his head pointing, the dancing Chinese characters, and that eerie scraping metal sound.  To that end, she enlists the aid of Ryuji Takayama, her ex-husband who teaches either math or physics at a university.  It's his analytical and logical mind that she feels can help her in this dilemma.

Ryuji watches the video and after getting Reiko to copy the video, analyzes weird sounds, images of an erupting volcano, and the character ""Sada"" seen in someone's eye.  Their investigation leads to Mount Miharajima on Izu Oshima, which is an island inbetween the two peninsulas which encircle Tokyo Bay, Izu Hanto and Boso Hanto.

I'd call this more a suspense thriller with supernatural overtones rather than an outright horror flick.  And it's a balance of appealing characters, an interesting and unique story, and low-key rather than Hollywood-style overblown style that place this over The Ring.  Other than the images of the video, flashback techniques in B&W help advance the story.  So does the technique used in Tomoko's death, a close-up of her fear-stricken face, a sudden reverse image, then nothing.

The tension keeps building as the date is presented onscreen, followed by a low and eerie sound, counting down the days Reiko has to live.  There is hardly any incidental music to speak of, as much of the sounds are of the same low and haunting sounds.  However, the thing that'll guarantee Ringu its immortality is the sight of Sadako, long black hair covering her face, dressed in a white robe, creeping out of the TV, hands with fingernails torn out, stalking her prey.  This spectre has been copied or revised in Japanese films like The Hypnotist, Ju-On, its American remake The Grudge, and the Scary Movie 3 parody.

Another thing to note is the change of Asakawa to a female character, as opposed to the male Kazuyuki Asakawa in the original novel.  And the distorted photographs and marks on arms is something in both the manga and here.

As Reiko Asakawa, Nanako Matsushima balances an amiable, hard-working employee and loving single mother who wants to spend more time with her son.  She's definitely warmer than the Korean version's Eun Kyung Shin, who played Hong Sun-Ju as somewhat of a cold fish.  Hiroyuki Sanada plays Ryuji with a stolid, curt, rational man who's intelligent enough to suss out the clues from the video.  And Rikiya Otaka also does well as Yoichi, who's cute and likeable rather than creepy.

I could actually go on for hours about this, but the thing I want to point out is the ridiculous horse story (& how a certain stupid character causes one to kill itself, because for some reason, she could not just leave it alone!!!). My main problem is all the ridiculous extra ""scary"" bits the remake threw in, like the hairball, the fly on the screen - totally unnecessary.

Although the American version is more visually detailed, the faces of the victims resembling drowned victims is much more clever than the scared to death faces of Ringu since the girl did drown to death, also the video tape in the American version was more disturbing, however the American version left more holes in the actual story that Ringu cleared up for me. For instance the reason the little girl was... the way she was. Ringu is a little more scientific, explaining the girl to be protective of her Mother where in The Ring  the girl seemed to be simply pure evil.

1404164,4,B000058CB6,"I think it's difficult to write a review for this movie without comparing and contrasting it with the US remake, but I will do my best.  In my opinion, neither film is perfect.  Some things worked better in Ringu, and some things worked better in The Ring.  But what I loved about both films is the way that both stories are different from each other, so that you can watch both and get something out of each one.

The new trend of remaking Asian horror films seems to come from this movie.  I can't understand why people get so upset about it, though.  For one thing, before the remake, it was impossible to get the original in America.  If you think this is such a great movie, why wouldn't you want more people to see it?  Also, with all the films Hideo Nakata has made, this is by no means his best work.  Most people I hear complaining about the American remake have never even seen anything else he's ever done.  Most importantly, with this film in particular, a remake is a very fitting choice, because it actually fits into the context of the story.  I can't elaborate on that, but when you see it, you'll understand what I mean.

The story centers around Asakawa, her son Yoichi, and her ex-husband Ryuji.  Asakawa is a reporter investigating rumors surrounding a mysterious video tape that local youths have been saying will kill the viewer one week after watcing it.  The inquiries take on a more personal meaning for her when her niece turns up dead under unexplained circumstances.  After a bit of poking around, Asakawa finds herself in the presence of the killer videotape.  So what does she do?  Of course she watches it!  Now that may not sound like the smart thing to do in a situation like this.  At least the other unsuspecting victims watched it by mistake.  But you know how those snoopy reporters are.  If you found a copy of a videotape that killed people, wouldn't you at least want to know what was on it?

Unfortnunately, the payoff isn't that great.  The videotape is a mishmash of weird yet boring images, and if I had turned in something like that for my experimental film project in ""Film Analysis: Formalist and Feminist"" class, I would not have passed.  Once Asakawa has gotten over her initial curiosity, she freaks out and calls Ryuji to help her find out what she can do to break that curse.

The main problem I have with this film is the character of Ryuji.  He is fascinating, and the actor playing him is very talented.  However, his character has had such a great arc from the novel, to the film, to the remake, that it seems that the screenwriter didn't know what to do with him.  In the novel, Asakawa is a man, and Ryuji is his detestable friend.  He despises humankind, and entertains Asakawa with stories about breaking into women's houses and raping them.  I think making Asakawa a female, and Ryuji her ex was a brilliant move.  They've got seven days to find the origin of the video tape, which is not nearly long enough to reconcile their personal differences.  However, his character had to undergo a great transformation between the novel and the film.  If they had him be as reprehensible as he was in the book, a strong female like Asakawa never would have had anything to do with him.  However, they had to keep some of his jerkiness in tact, because they were filming the sequel at the same time, and his evil nature played a part in it.  (This is ""Rasen,"" not ""Ring 2.""  ""Rasen"" is based on the second novel, but the movie turned out so crappy that Nakata had to make his own alternate sequel, ""Ring 2,"" which was a completely new idea.)

So Ryuji appears here as somewhat of a contradiction between two selves.  And for some reason, they chose to give him psychic powers.  His psychic abilities were not in the novel, and I don't think they added anything to the story.  His powers allow the villian, a young woman named Sadako, to appear right in front of him when he's sitting on a park bench.  He remains calm, and actually speaks to her.  Then later, when they want to make him be scared, he is so scared that he can't move.  The character is interesting, but disjointed.  In the remake, the writer seemed to consider all of this, and made Noah, the ex, a complete flake, and somewhat of a coward.  His contribution was his expertise in video equipment, not a staggering intellect.

It is difficult to say too much more about this film, as there is so much more to learn that I don't want to give away too soon.  But what works here is that the story makes use of modern technology intertwined with a traditional ghost story.  Televisions, VCR's, telephones, these are all modern inventions not usually associated with ghosts.  We don't typically put ghosts and technology together because they are otherworldly in death, and it is assumed that they came from a more primitive time in life, before these things were invented.  That's why a techno update of the ghost story works, because it scares us with things we never thought of as scary before.

If you are a fan of the recent wave of Japanese horror, or the American version of The Ring, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  It should be noted that the famous scene near the end that everyone remembers from The Ring was not in the novel, but was an invention of Hideo Nakata.",1100390400,10,5298,4.5

Then one day I saw Ringu and its slow pace at first turned me off but when I reached the end not only was I truly scared, I was scared for days after, even just thinking about it.  I've become a fan of Japanese horror movies and Dark Water was just as scary.  I love American horror, but sometimes it's just so obvious and they always go for the blood and gore.  Now I like the slow pace, watching the characters doing daily chores, just like we do in our lives.  They seem a lot more like real people than in American horror films so the horror that they experience makes you think that it could happen to you.  Face it, none of us are going skinning dipping in a lake and having a guy with a chainsaw come after us, but all of us go to the grocery store, make dinner and many of us pick kids up from school.

1404167,4,B000058CB6,"I reluctantly went out to rent The Ring only because I kept hearing it was a good movie. I thought it was gonna suck for some reason but when it was over I realized I was wrong it was one of the best horror movies Id ever seen and most original. Then I heard there was an original japanese version of the ring called Ringu and had to run and buy it. Great movie especially for japanese people but us too. The whole movie is done in english subtitles but if you understand japanese just listen. Same plot as The Ring with a few different twists throughout the movie and at the end. However, my personal oppinion is unless you enjoy reading subtitles while watching an entire movie which is not the most enjoyable thing in the world to most of us, stick with the english version of the film ""The Ring"" which aside from a more familiar language has a scarier feel to it and a little better explanation in it pertaining to certain parts of the movie. Ringu leaves a lot of blanks during the movie making you wonder about things too much.  Overall this is still an excellent movie especially if you really liked thr ring and want to see another version.",1098662400,2,1148,4.339534883720931
1404168,5,B000058CB6,"The title of the film, ""Ringu"" refers not to anything circular but to the ringing of the telephone that follows each viewing of the cursed video tape.  The telephone, with its harsh, sudden blare, has always been a vehicle of horror and suspense, from Agnes Morehead's classic and chilling ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" to its role in ""Scream."" The television has also been a portal for the unreal, in films such as ""Videodrome"" and ""Poltergeist.""  There is something about the flickering screen, the way a TV sucks in your attention and the possibility that something is watching from the other side of the screen that makes it as natural an element in a horror story as a grave or a well.

""Ringu"" uses these elements, combining a feeling both modern and ancient, to tell a most excellent ghost story.  Ghost stories work best when they are subtle, creepy and manifest a feeling that something invisible is watching you just outside your field of vision, although possible in the same room as you.  This film has exactly that atmosphere, with patient Japanese storytelling drawing out the suspense to an unbeatable climax.

The actors all do an excellent job, avoiding the Japanese penchant for over-the-top melodrama and delivering performances as subtle as the story.  Kabuki-trained Rie Inou makes the most of her onscreen time as Sadako. Nanako Matsushima is lovely and determined as the desperate reporter, hunting for the key that will save her's and her child's lives.  Hiroyuki Sanada is a cool character as Nanako's psychically sensitive husband.  Rikiya Otaka shows once again that few things are genuinely creepier than a little kid.

Without revealing any of the story, I will say that some background knowledge of Japanese supernatural traditions would probably clear up some of the confusing points of the film.  Certain things are left unexplained, any more than an American film would explain why a vampire feared a wooden stake.  It is just assumed that everyone watching the movie will already know this.

The ""Ringu"" DVD itself is disappointing, offering no features whatsoever and one would think that such an infamous film would get a better presentation.  Also, the subtitles are not very well done, and often do a lackluster job of transferring the meaning of the Japanese dialog.  One gets the sense that this was rushed out, trying to capture some of the enthusiasm for the Hollywood remake.",1096848000,11,2410,5.005012531328321
1404169,5,B000058CB6,"I was one of the people who saw the American version of this film first, and I have to say that I liked it quite a bit...until I saw the Japanese version. I thought the American version went too far in trying to make Samara into some sort of freak of nature--her unnatural conception, her ability to create pictures not only on video but on walls, and her strange effect on horses--but none of that was in the Japanese version, and I don't think it needed to be. It actually makes it scarier that we don't know very much about Sadako, except that she could kill people by wishing it. Other than that, she seems to have been a normal girl, which makes it all the more tragic that she was murdered. We don't feel much sympathy for Samara, since she was a monster.

There are still some questions I have about the storyline that are answered by neither version, such as how Sadako/Samara could utilize a technology that hadn't even been invented in her lifetime; and since she appears to come from the TV, how did she kill the kids in the car? All in all, though, I think the Japanese version just makes more sense because it doesn't try to explain the supernatural.",1093824000,6,1163,4.409302325581395

I felt that ""The Ring"" was holding my hand, constantly flashing back to the video to remind us of plot and location. This was not necessary to anyone who is paying attention to the film. To me it felt as though it lessened the creepy factor present in the original. Finally, the climax and resolution were far more satisfying in ""Ringu"".",1093046400,2,520,4.6923076923076925
1404172,5,B000058CB6,"I did watch the re-make first, but the Japanese version blew me away. The fear I got when watching it was so strange and once the movie started... I never wanted to take it off, never wanted it to end. In the American version, you get to Morgan Range Farm and I almost switch it off. The American version tried to explain everything, and blew and hinted to us the final out come. The Japanese one didn't...

Now for the roles and story: There is a rumor going around about a cursed video, one that if you watch it a week later... you're dead. This strange rumor grabs the attention a young, pretty, divorce, single mother- Asakawa Reiko (Played outstandingly by Nanako Matsushima). Suddenly, the rumors start to jump back at her when her niece dies of unknown causes. Reiko searches come to prove that not only her niece but also, three of her niece's friends had died all on the same day. A week after staying at a holiday resort called 'Izu'.

Reiko decides to look into Izu to see what she can find, and it's there she finds an unmarked video tape... and watches it. Indeed, it's the curse video...

Now in a panic and a race to save her life before the deadline, she calls on the support of her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama (A great job from Hiroyuki Sanada), who also watches the tape. Remaining calm, Ryuji decides to help his terrified ex-wife, and help her find out who made the tape and why.

Reiko and Ryuji suddenly find themselves on an even more stressful journey when their young son, (A small yet amazing job from Rikiya Otaka) Yoichi watches the tape.

The actors and actresses are well chosen and their performances are outstanding. The most impressing job was from the leading lady, Nanako Matsushima. She was very good at creating the character of Reiko Asakawa as a loving, protective yet fearless and brave woman that any audience could fall in love with. The chemistry that was between Reiko and Ryuji was so great and well created you could have cut it with a knife. Matsushima and Sanada were impressive at creating it... Of course I would have expected any less from such a great actor and actress.

I have to say I wasn't impressed. Ringu offered few scares and I thought the ending sucked and was not scary at all.

I might rent ""The Ring"", hoping it will be scarier. I don't need special effects to be scared, but this had nothing. The video was weak, and I don't think all this hype is doing any favors. I was expecting scary and I got nothing.

The suspense, the eerie atmosphere, all those playing with your mind thrills, and not to mention the creepiest soundtrack I've ever heard, all culminate to make one really creepy movie! I had the pleasure of watching this when it was shown in cinema and trust me, Ringu on the wide screen, really has a lot of impact, compared to the small TV. The sound system is louder (imagine the soundtrack!) and the images are bigger. My friend and I were clutching one another's hand tightly in several scenes, we almost had a heart attack with the climatic scene!

If you enjoyed Ringu over The Ring (American remake) and fell in love with Japanese horror, please do yourself a favor and watch Dark Water. This Japanese horror movie will thrill you just as much.",1092009600,4,902,4.672955974842767
1404175,5,B000058CB6,"I don't know what it is about Asian cinema, but when they make a scary movie, they make a SCARY movie. I saw the American version (The Ring with Naomi Watts) first and thought it was pretty scary. In fact, I paid to see it twice in theaters and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. When I heard that the Japanese predecessor was better, I had to watch it. I was impressed. At the time, I still didn't think highly of foreign films; I still expected the bad dubbing and horrible special effects. This movie marked the beginning of my newfound appreciation for foreign films. Even more astonishing was that this movie helped me better understand the American version that I had already watched and loved. I think what makes Ringu better is that the Japanese aren't afraid to bring elements of the paranormal into their movies. Psychics (from what I read and hear) are pretty common in Japan, and the idea of psychic abilites plays into Ringu a lot. I think if the American version had played that angle up more the movie would have been even better. Ringu's ending is more sinister than The Ring's ending; it poses some difficult questions (at least it did for me). The only downside for some people will be that there is no English soundtrack; you have to read subtitles while you watch the action. This didn't bother me, but my brother says he won't watch it because he ""watches movies, not reads them."" He's missing out on something great.",1090368000,5,1444,4.515267175572519
1404176,5,B000058CB6,"Ok I saw the American version first, and when I first saw it I didn't really like it, mostly because I wasn't really sure WHY I should be scared. After watching it a couple times again I was truly chilled by it, gaining a better understanding of the story and I heard that the Japanese version was better so I invested in the entire set, Ring, Ring 2 and Ring 0...
I have to say after seeing the Ring (I've heard you should buy this version, the version I bought was a poor transfer, a little too dark at times...) amd Ringu that Ringu is the superior film. It just is. The Ring is good and chilling but the story of Ringu is far better.
For example the story of Sadako's mother makes MORE sense as to why she is the way she is than does the story of Samara. Sadako inherited powers from her mother, where as Samara was just bothered by her mother's horses. Samara's paternity is never addressed where as in Ringu Sadako's is hinted at and the idea is terrifying.
There were few special effects in this movie and I guess if you can't get scared unless everything is super fancy then this is not the movie for you. I however thought the lack of special effects made the movie seem more real and made it scarier to me. The Ring was all grey looking so it seemed to be going on in a way where it couldn't happen to you, because our world doesn't look like that. However it's the opposite in Ringu where everything is very natural and normal looking.
I also think the famous out the tv scene was ruined in the American version because of all the stupid pointless special effects in that. The Japanese scene is far more chilling, and the reporter's son is more interesting and engaging than the Sixth Sense boy in the Ring.
I also preferred the couple. Reiko and Ryuji were more convincing together than the American couple. They had better chemistry and Ryuji was more involved right away from the start and a lot less of a doubting Thomas.
Basically, the Japanese movie seems more original and terrifying in my opinion, where as the American version tries too hard with it's CGI and falls desperately short. With Ringu less is DEFINITELY more.",1089936000,8,2140,4.406565656565657

Ringu's creep-factor and build up of tension to its ultimate culmination is a work of brilliance. The Ring, at times, will meander aimlessly into places that have no meaning or little relevance. The 'mystery video' in The Ring is also far too long and some of the stuff in it doesn't even apply to the story.

1404178,4,B000058CB6,"This review is spoiler-ish, and intended for people who've seen The Ring and were curious about this movie.
First of all, the two films are very similiar - at the beginning, they even share most of the same shots, like the father and son confronting each other in the rain - but I think that The Ring was an improvement mainly for these reasons:
1) The Ring is scarier. Some people say it's just unsubtle, but the subject at hand is a horror movie, not an existential treatise, even if the story is brainier than most. It's true that The Ring, as another review very aptly put it, 'goes for the throat,' but it does so very well, while Ringu has only a few moments of real terror. There's nothing here to match the equine imagery, or the 'drowned' faces.
2) The score is very creaking and unsubtle. Obviously in a horror movie, the score kicks up whenever something scary is about to happen, but I noticed it a lot more - it seemed a lot more contrived - in this movie, as opposed to The Ring. You hear the violins start screeching and you just roll your eyes.
3) Both versions skimp on the backstory, but Ringu does much more so than The Ring. In The Ring, you get to see the living Samara speak, at least, which I think is important in establishing her as a character, and the story surrounding the girl's family seems at once more ominous and more believable in The Ring. Part of what made The Ring so effective was the horror in the backstory, and it's much less developed in Ringu, even if Sadako's origin is better explained.
4) The treatment of the ex-husband character (whose equivalent in the book was the main thing which made the book so great) is dissapointing in both films, but in this one, not to spoil anything, there's a random twist to his character which made no sense to me, and which was sensibly dropped in The Ring.
5) The Ring actually makes it clear what the ring _is_, and what Samara's curse, symbolically, is (a disease, something that was played up a lot in the book).
6) Ultimately, I think that the motivation at the heart of The Ring is revenge, even though it's suggested that Samara/Sadako is evil by nature, and in relation to #3, I don't think it's really made clear to what extent she suffered. When the ex-husband character descends into the well, he remarks in passing that she was still alive, a fact which was played up more (and to good effect) in The Ring. Ringu makes it seem sort of like Sadako created the tape just for the heck of it. The desperation and malice in her character comes across much better in The Ring. She doesn't have a character, you could say, but good monsters do, and she did in The Ring.
On the other side, the acting in Ringu is just a touch better than in The Ring - the main character's face communicates fear so well, it's almost scarier than the faces of the corpses - and it avoids a couple of the eye-rolling contrivances like the sliding television which weakened The Ring with its subtler atmosphere, but ultimatley, I think a story as scary is this one deserved the extremely scary treatment given to it by The Ring. Ringu is still worth seeing, but for once us Americans got it right.",1088467200,,3163,4.417808219178082
1404179,3,B000058CB6,"Ringu was an excellent movie, but I find I enjoyed the American version better.  However, the Japanese movie explained things better.
To get the full story I recommend the comic book, Ringu, then The Ring.  This story, like Final Fantasy VII, leaves a lot open to discusion.  Points like what Samara was, how her parents arranged her birth, how her curse worked, and other questions are pretty much left open to let the viewers decide for themselves.
The Japanese version plays up the psychic power aspect more then the American version, to the point of using it only as a way to move the plot.  That aside, this movie is a great movie, and it truely is one of the scarier ones I've seen.",1087603200,,688,4.524193548387097

translated, and those curiously unimportant. Without subtitling, the plot is almost impossible to decipher, and once you do, it's not scary at all. Don't waste your money.",1084579200,5,479,4.783132530120482
1404181,5,B000058CB6,"Creepy film.  Not very bloody at all for a horror film:  the scares come from psychological tension and an intriguing story.  I like how they used scenes from the ""killer"" video as clues in uncovering the mystery (or part of it) behind the curse.  Reminds me just a little of photographs in the Antonioni movie BLOW UP.  Also, the ""false"" reflections the girl sees in the blank TV screens were a disturbing effect; you start seeing your own reflection while you're watching (unless you have one of those nonreflecting flat-screen TVs, I suppose).
I saw the U.S. version THE RING first, so that one probably affects my perceptions of RINGU more than the other way around.  Hard to review one without comparing it to the other.  This one has somewhat less plot and fewer scare scenes than the THE RING does, but I don't think that lessens it any.  The U.S. version has nicer, weirder visual effects and flashbacks, and its complex backstory behind the curse is more involving (I thought).  But that kid in the U.S. version reminded me too much of the kid in THE SIXTH SENSE.  And I thought that the increased number of foreshadowing (or backshadowing?) scenes in the U.S. film stole just a little bit from the big scene with the girl crawling out of the well; whereas the Japanese version has fewer scare scenes along the way, so the big scene hits you with more impact.  Also, I thought the crippled motion of the girl in the Japanese version (when she walks toward the screen) is more unsettling than what we see in the U.S. version; as is how we never see her face at all in the Japanese version.  But they're both clever horror films; if you like one you'll probably like the other.
Couple interesting notes:  A little web browsing reveals that the RING movies, novels, manga, and TV series have evolved into a whole minor industry in Japan.  Also, the novel's author claims the title RING was originally as much a verb (as in to ""ring"" someone on the phone) as a noun.",1083974400,5,1971,4.5625

Which ever version you see first is the one you will like better.  Sure, The Ring had a better budget, special effects, marketing and so on.  Ringu has pure atmosphere and that is what separates Asian and American films.  I will admit that coming home from Chinatown at 2:30 am and watching Ringu immediately was not the best decision made (After the film, I was afraid to go to the bathroom; so what?) It did it's job, it scared me.  Of course, living in the middle of the woods helped out.  Give this film the chance it deserves.

The supposedly scary scenes use cheesy horror tricks to try and scare you and it just doesn't work. ""The tape"" is really short, and lacks the artistic edge of the tape in ""The Ring"". I've seen animations that were more unsettling. The story (what there is of it) progresses too quickly and the elements within that were omitted from ""The Ring"" were omitted for very good reasons.

My ignorance led me to make the ROOKIE MISTAKE of watching Ringu.......alone.
I am old enough to remember when Bruce Willis had hair but for the next few nights, I slept (well, tried to sleep) with the light on like the thumb-sucking baby it reduced me to. Every once in a while, I feel compelled to give the TV screen a reassuring tap just to make sure it's still solid.
It makes me mad that Hollywood once again encouraged America's allergic reaction to subtitles with the re-make ""The Ring"" which had the obligatory incidental music which dictated the expected responses long before the actual response and the treat-them-like-they're-stupid method of explaining everything so the trendies wouldn't have to do any thinking for themselves.

Here we don't have shock scenes or something frightfull jumping at the screen - the trademarks of American horror movies. What we have is atmosphere and mood turned to tne highest degree possible. In some way it can be compared to Blair Witch Project. Not the plot, but the feeling of impending doom hanging above the characters.
Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 are also interesting, adding to the story. While 2 is reminiscent of the original Ringu, it's still a good thriller, not just repetition of the same material.
The Spiral is another story. It was the first sequel for immensely popular Ringu, but dissapointed fans immensely, and so Ringu 2 was made instead. Spiral is a kind of supernatural melodrama, there is nearly no scares of any kind in this movie. You can watch it out of curiosity, but be warned that it's VERY different.",1069891200,2,1001,4.629213483146067
1404189,4,B000058CB6,"I enjoyed both the US and Japanese movies! Both are scary films!
I've seen all four of the Japanese movies, Ring1,2,0 and Ring Spiral.  I do believe that the Japanese version is best seen in context with the sequels.  Together they create a complete view of the sad story of Sadako.  Sadako is a much more sympathetic character than is Samara.  She, herself, is a victim of some unspeakable evil!
The US Ring's ghost is just plain 'EVIL'. I have no sympathy for Samara. She scares the ""living daylights"" out of me. I probably would have thrown in the well, also.
There are deleted scenes in the US film which I wish were left in the movie.  They provide some important background to the plot.
But, I'll keep both and scare myself on a regular basis. :)
The original Haunting and the Lady in White still are at the top of my list of ghostly horror movies.  But, these are not far behind.",1069804800,,886,4.404907975460123
1404190,5,B000058CB6,"i wish i'd only seen this one prior to watching 2002's sleeper hit the ring which is a terrible remake of this japanese suspense thriller. actually, this is more of a supernatural horror film but it's definately worlds away from the american stinker that everyone so loves. in this film, we actually have a bit more atmosphere & it's the whole atmosphere of the film which is entirely creepy instead of jumpy music, horses going crazy, & suicides in showers with electronic components. ok, i hope i didn't spoil this one for you. here we have a young japanese woman who is investigating an urban legend about a freaky character that comes on late at nite on your television & then you receive a phone call shortly after viewing that states you will die in seven days. to make things much worse, there is a videotape going around with some artsy imagery(looks like something a college student would make for a film festival) which will generate a phone call from the dead. after learning of the death of her niece, the woman overhears stories of how the young girl may have died & seeks out to find the truth. you probably know the basics of the plot if you saw the dreaded americna version so i will spare you some of the agony. i like this one better for several reasons. this story gives us more interaction between the lead characters which is going to allow viewers to understand how they arrive at their conclusions in solving the mystery of the ring. also, we have the lead character's ex-husband who has esp so he is able to see certain things simply by touching someone's personal effects or their skin. in addition to that, i like the fact the japanese woman in this film is a much better mother than the horrible one we saw in the ring. lastly, we understand sadako's anger & reason for killing a bit more in this one than we do in the remake. the remake would have you to believe she was born evil like a michael myers which was not credible in my opinion. again, the atmosphere is the thing that will leave you uneasy in this film which is what thrillers of the sixties & seventies could do like those great classics by polanski. the atmosphere here is always eerie & there is nothing pleasant about ringu whatsoever. check this one out first if you are trying to decide which one to buy. if you love this, then avoid the remake at all costs.",1069718400,,2354,4.464037122969837

I haven't been scared with a movie for so longtime but this one did. So I was expected the US version far superior to the Japanese and finally it's not. Japanese made the best scary movie without spending much in FX.Everything is in the atmosphere and you scare of the stuff you finally don't see on screen. Bravo ! Otherwise I watched RINGU 2 and RING 0 or RINGU 0 and unfortunately I was quite disappointed. Ring  0 is of course the prequel and even if there are some creepy moments, the story could have been more frightning. I found it very uninteresting and finally impatient to see the movie finished. RINGU 2 is certainly worst. It is bad ! The story is just too flat ! Like a lack of creativity. A pity. USA are working on THE RING 2 now so I just hope they don't work it on the same plot as RINGU 2 because we will have one more time a sequel that will disappoint ! To end, try to get AUDITION also from Japan. EXCELLENT !",1068163200,,1072,4.1291866028708135
1404192,5,B000058CB6,"Unlike some, I didn't think the remake was so very terrible: a slick, more effective than average American horror film. Rather as ""The Magnificent Seven"" was a slick, more effective than average American Western. But no comparison with ""The Seven Samurai"" which was like nothing you'd ever seen before. And so is this. Of course it's maybe a bit culturally correct always to prefer the subtitled original to the big budget Hollywood remake so perhaps I'm just kidding myself on. But then I ask myself how excited I am at the prospect of seeing Hideo Nakata's latest, ""Dark Water"", compared to how excited I am at the prospect of seeing ""Pirates of the Carribean"" and all such doubts vanish very, very fast.
It is probably best to do as I did and watch the two versions in the right order, the first first. This was very hard for Americans, I gather, as the studio, having got their hands on the rights, took great pains to ensure nobody saw the Japanese version first.
One joy of the Japanese version is that it is so much less tidy. It's a mystery story and as it unfolds we get a glimpse of the solution to the various riddles. But it's just that, a glimpse. Lose ends abound. What exactly is the significance of the figure in the video with a white hood covering his/her head? We aren't told: it's left to our imagination. As it should be. Perhaps for a satisfying crime mystery we want every neatly tied up. For a satisfying supernatural mystery we surely do not.
See it anyway. It's probably one of the best four or five horror movies that have ever been made. It is infused with a uniquely strange and disturbing atmosphere. Silence is used to terrific effect. The picture is generally so drained of colour that when you remember it later you won't be sure it was in colour at all. The acting is excellent. Rikiya Otaka is particularly extraordinary as the little boy Yoichi.
(This reviews the DVD but of course, given the story line, one really should watch it on video. Incidentally, I did recently read somewhere that this film is remarkable for marrying East and West given the strikingly western technological theme of videotapes. Ignorant as I am of things Japanese, that does seem extremely silly. My own video player is a Sanyo. Where was yours made?)",1068163200,2,2265,4.622828784119107
1404193,2,B000058CB6,"Ok, I've seen it after the american version and I was very disapointed. The problem is not the lack of special FX or the peculiarities of japanese culture, the thing is that in this version every single character seems to have paranormal powers, which is ridiculous. While in the american version the mystery is solved simply by examing carefully the images of the tape, in this one everybody has visions and dreams, which make the movie less rational (if we can say so of a horror movie). Also, the american version leaves more open doors to Samara's story (Sadako), this one tells everything.",1067731200,2,594,4.776699029126213
1404194,5,B000058CB6,"I'll admit it, I saw this movie before watching the American version, BUT I did see them within the same weekend, so I have a fairly decent conception of both. It helps that my friends and I spent hours discussing the two movies after watching The Ring.
Ringu and The Ring are scary for entirely different reasons. To someone like me, who rarely enjoys horror/suspense flicks, I found myself enjoying both, though I did prefer Ringu's subtle, yet terrifying, building tension to the Hollywood frights of The Ring.
As has been stated in previous reviews, Ringu relies on the fear of the unknown. What aren't they telling us? What horrible truth is lurking just out of sight, around the corner, or just seven days from now? The entire movie is a quiet, creeping kind of horror. It's lack of bright colors and soundtrack of mood music allow the viewer to focus of the events and drag the viewer deep into the story as we try to unravel the mystery on our own, along with the characters.
Be warned, there ARE some cultural perculiarities that, if one has little to no knowledge of Japanese culture, may be confusing (such as the figure in the video with the white cloth over their head). However, these are few in number and in no way detract from the story in any way. On the contrary, considering the subtle, questing air of the entire film, the unfamiliar elements only add to unsettling experiance.
If you're a diehard fan of Hollywood horrow flicks with their FX and straight-forward storylines, this may not be the movie for you, though you should find The Ring a thoroughly enjoyable movie. However, if you want to try a different perspective on the horror genre, or are already a fan of Japanese film, this is definately a must see.
A story of a terrible legacy that will haunt you for days, or, if you're like me, months...
As a side note, if you enjoy either movie, but find yourself with too many unanswered questions, buy the book the inspired them all: ""Ring"" by Koji Suzuki.",1067731200,25,1984,4.607344632768362

1404197,3,B000058CB6,"I owned the Japanese version of ""Ringu"" before the American film came out, but I saw the remake first because my old DVD player wouldn't cooperate.  When I saw ""The Ring"" I couldn't wait to crack into my DVD - if the remake was this good, image how good the original is.  When I replaced my player and finally watched ""Ringu"" I was disappointed.  The American version is not as subtle as the Japanese, but it is much more startling.  ""The Ring"" has several moments in the film where you just about jump out of your skin, whereas there is nothing particularly scream-evoking about the original.  True, scare factor isn't exactly high art, but this is a horror movie, not a short story.
Simply put, the remake is of vastly better production quality and although the special effects are far superior, the film still seems more real because the American version veers away from the supernatural/ESP aspect of the Japanese version.  ""Ringu"" often falls back on the telepathic talents of its characters to lead you through the mystery, while better-written ""The Ring"" has the answers flow from the action.  Also, as some other writers have mentioned, there seem to be superfluous parts of the original that you wish the author tied to the story.  On the whole, while ""Ringu"" is an interesting movie, I find the American version scarier and much more tightly written and recommend it for everyone who loves a good scare.",1063670400,4,1413,4.762295081967213
1404198,5,B000058CB6,"I can only say one thing about this movie-amazing! Ringu is absolutely terrifying. This is a the BEST horror film. It's like this: A mysterious videotape has been linked to the deaths of several teens. Reporter Reiko tracks down the tape and watches it. The tape is a visual nightmare, if not disturbing.
Since the rumor goes that you will die seven days after watching it, she tries to solve the tape's mystery-quick.

Because I'm writing this review at night, I am constantly looking over my shoulder. Ringu one movie where you don't realize how scared you are until you notice how closely similare the situations are to real life. Unlike the American remake, it's story is very well put together. Everything is explained, from the story of Sadako to Reiko's decision at the end of the movie. I cannot reccomend this movie enough!",1062806400,4,832,4.777777777777778
1404199,2,B000058CB6,"Having an interest in Japanese culture (I live here after all), I became very interested in this movie after seeing the American remake.  I loved the remake, although you have to take it for what it is.  I didn't expect a seemless plot or anything like that, but a good movie to freak me out and put me on edge...
The remake did all that.  Extremely creepy visual effects, just enough special effects to be unnerving without being eye candy, great little touches.  I had heard the original was better.
I did not find it to be.  Instead I found it a humdrum B movie that didn't really hold my interest.  Sure, I knew most of the plot already and perhaps that helped steal the show.  But for me the best part of the remake is how the larger movie continually incorporates portions of the ""video"" into the whole story (the ladder, the chair, the centipede, etc.).  The original is pretty straightforward.  The story is tighter, the acting about the same... but the little touches that take the remake over the top just aren't there.
I would only recommend this if you already have an interest in Japan and really liked the original.  Otherwise, leave it at the warehouse.",1062374400,,1168,4.545454545454546
1404200,4,B000058CB6,"Hollywood seems to have lost the ability to make a decent horror flick in recent years. Japan, however, does an exceptional job of turning out high-quality, moody horror. Ringu is a perfect example of this. Subdued and moody, Ringu is one of the spookiest movies I've seen in years. Seeing the buzz generated by it and its sequels, Hollywood decided it could do a better job, bought the rights, and threw out a hack version of a truly enjoyable film. Ringu works because of its subtlety and atmosphere. While some may be turned off by the supernatural/psychic aspects, they work within the scope of the movie. Both Ringu and The Ring made my skin crawl, but for much different reasons--Ringu, because it worked so well, and The Ring because it didn't.

Ringu clearly had a lower budget than the Ring but it hardly matters. With very little violence or special effects they manage to keep you on the edge of your seat (the voice in the tape got me a few times and I was already expecting it). This DVD is a great addition to any collection (though an extra or two would have been nice). If you enjoy the DVD I must also recommend looking into the original novel ^-~.",1062115200,2,679,4.112781954887218
1404202,3,B000058CB6,"As an American teenager, I [not surprisingly] saw ""The Ring"" first and was so impressed with it that I later rented and viewed ""Ringu."" While in ""The Ring,"" almost every second of the movie is eerie and frightening in some way, only certain moments of ""Ringu"" did I find to be absolutely terrifying. Now, we must understand that because this film was created first, its makers receive the credit for the whole ""cursed film that kills you in seven days by a creepy girl in a well"" concept. Also, it had the tough job of laying the foundation for such a story. When ""Ringu"" was adapted into ""The Ring,"" it was elaborated on and made scarier. Since I saw ""The Ring"" first, it's no shock or disappointment to me that this one didn't scare me quite as much. After ""The Ring,"" I honestly wasn't expecting it. I don't think I'll ever see a scarier movie than ""The Ring.""
""Ringu"" begins much the same way; a strange little boy, his mother, and his father-who-doesn't-act-like-a-father are the stars. The boy's female teenage cousin is killed by the tape. The mother investigates and watches it herself--unwittingly committing suicide. Almost, that is. From there, however, the details are far different. The video in ""Ringu"" is less than half as long as the one in ""The Ring"" and is at least thirty times less chilling and upsetting. It contains few of the same images; no flies, no spinning chair, no ladder. We see only the woman brushing her hair in the mirror, some rather large men, a person with a white cap on their head, and the well. Few of these images are clearly explained (which isn't a problem, since it leaves some mystery to the imagination), but after the video in ""The Ring,"" it was slightly disappointing. The story goes that a good psychic woman (Anna Morgan's counterpart) has a daughter who is an evil psychic who kills people just by wishing their death. Her name is Sadako (in the new version, Samara). Her mother commits suicide. Her father pushes her down the well. She creates the video and begins spreading her wrath through it.
None of the terrifying images in ""The Ring""'s grainy, bluish-tinted video would make sense in ""Ringu."" Nor do they ever stretch the tape and pull out a living creature. Nosebleeds and scribbled-out faces play no part in ""Ringu."" Blurry photographs and reflections do. Some elements were kept the same, others were altered. Like I said, some parts of this movie were just not as suspenseful. Others, like Sadako's attack of Ryuji (Asakawa, the main character's, ex-husband, and Yoichi, the little boy's, father), are very, very scary indeed. Sadako is every bit as menacing as Samara. Her eye is even scarier than Samara's--however, once out of the TV, she does not have the ""digital"", grainy, bluish appearance of the video.
Once dead, the victims in ""Ringu"" simply look afraid, and dead. They don't have that gnarly, twisted, revolting look they were given in the later movie. But again, this was the foundation, not the elaboration, and I respect that. Yoichi had a smaller role than did Aidan. He was not as ""in-tune"" with Sadako as Aidan was with Samara. There was no ranch, no horses, no ladder or barn for him to know about. The music and scenery were also less frightening than in ""The Ring."" Sadako's mother was very interested in the sea, for some not-very-significant reason. Down in the well, Asakawa and Ryuji try to lift the curse. (They find her fingernails, stuck in the sides from climbing out.) They find Sadako's body. Of course, it turns out that Ryuki still must die; the only way to save yourself is to copy the tape and show it to someone else.
Overall, this movie was pleasing, enjoyable, and most of all: scary! But, I would have liked it more if was longer, more detailed, and dealt with more symbols. Even though Rachel's quest in ""The Ring"" was very well-explained and almost seemed simple to figure out, it didn't come across that way. And honestly, in this film it wasn't any more difficult to find the well or figure anything out. The main characters just didn't get led around in a big circle during the mystery. There was one part that made little sense: Ryuji sits in the park, sees a pair of woman's feet in white shoes, and asks, ""Was it you? Did you do this?"" or something. It wasn't terribly scary and didn't fit in. So basically, this movie gets the credit for starting the whole ""Ring"" story. But it could have stood to be better--and then an adapted version might not have been necessary. For example, we could have seen more of Sadako's story. We see Samara being interviewed at the hospital. We also see Becka, the dead cousin's friend, in a mental hospital.
I know I've been comparing the two movies this whole time. But doing so is necessary to review ""Ringu""!",1061596800,8,4753,4.686602870813397
1404203,5,B000058CB6,"I loved The Ring, and I had been looking forward to seeing the original Japanese adaptation of the film, based on the novel by Koji Suzuki, for some time.  I was especially pleased to see the Japanese film released with English subtitles rather than voice dubbing, since this helps preserve the original atmosphere of the film.  Both Ringu and The Ring are superb, dark, creepy films, very similar yet very different from one another.  Inevitably, whichever film you watch first will probably be your favorite of the two.  Ringu starts out very much like its American counterpart, with two young girls alone in a house discussing the rumors going around about a video that somehow kills you seven days after you watch it.  The aunt of the first victim is a reporter who begins to investigate the story of the tape, soliciting the help of her somewhat inscrutable ex-husband, and soon finding herself in an incredible fight to save the lives of herself, her ex, and her creepy little boy.  At this point, Ringu begins to distinguish itself from The Ring, although both follow the same general plot through to the end.

Perhaps the biggest difference between Ringu and The Ring is the contents of the mysterious videotape.  In Ringu, the cursed tape is much shorter and far less symbolic, although its grainy appearance and comparative simplicity add a greater dash of realism to it.  The tape presented in The Ring is much more frightening and visceral; subtlety rules the day in the Japanese film.  Another significant difference concerns the character of the reporter's ex-husband; in Ringu, he (as well as his son, to some degree) possesses a gift that distinguishes him from his American counterpart.  This aids the plot along, but it deprives the viewer of some of the mystery and insight gained from watching the mystery unfold in The Ring.  Ringu's storyline is much more compact and straightforward, providing us with much less insight into the forces at play in explaining the existence of the cursed video.  There is one jolting plot twist in the later stages of The Ring that is not found in Ringu, and I think this takes a little something away from the concluding drama, but Ringu definitely delivers a much more frightening, completely unforgettable climax.  The big scene with the little girl climbing out of the well is pretty darned creepy in The Ring, but Ringu's presentation of this seminal event is many times more impressive and frightening; I only wish I could have seen the scene from Ringu before I saw The Ring.  It is spooky enough as it is, but I can only dream about the impact the scene might have on those with no previous knowledge of what is about to happen.  What The Ring accomplishes pretty impressively with a type of trick photography is expressed naturally in Ringu, making it much more eerie and unsettling.

If you did see and enjoy The Ring, I would definitely recommend getting a copy of Ringu.  The knowledge you already have will diminish the impact Ringu has on you, but there are enough differences between the two films to guarantee you a thoroughly enjoyable return trip into this most special world of fear.  If you are debating which version to see first, I would recommend starting out with Ringu, if for no other reason than for the power of the much creepier ending.  I prefer The Ring's more elaborate and symbolic presentation, more in-depth background into the story of the tape, and added plot twists to the less elaborate presentation of Ringu, but the fact that the American film adds new elements to the plot makes The Ring more engaging for those having already seen Ringu than Ringu is for those having already seen The Ring.",1059782400,115,3687,4.794628751974724
1404204,4,B000058CB6,"By the time I saw ""The Ring"" I was aware that the 2002 film was based on this 1998 Japanese film, which in turn was a remake of an earlier television project that was based on a book.  However, for most of us this movie is as far back as we are going to be able to follow the trail.  The main thing is to warn you not to watch ""Ringu"" and ""The Ring"" (or ""The Ring"" and ""Ringu"") back to back.  I made that mistake with ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Point of No Return"" and would hate for anybody to do a repeat with another set of Foreign Original/American Remake.  For that matter, do not watch ""The Ring"" and ""FearDotCom"" back to back.  Wait a while (say, oh, I don't know, seven days...).
The story revolves around an urban legend about videotape: if you watch it, you die seven days later.  That is apparently what happened to four young friends, although reporter Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) finds this hard to believe.  But then she watches the tape and the clock has started ticking.  Leaving her precocious son at home, she is aided by her ex-husband in uncovering the mystery of the videotape.  Is there a rationale explanation behind this videotape of death?  Not in the real world sense, but there are rules to the game in ""Ringu"" and as with ""The Ring"" the most interesting part is how the reporter unravels the vague clues found in the bizarre images on the videotape in her race to save her life (and those of others).  You can make your own judgment as to whether or not the payoff is worth the journey; in that sense ""Ringu"" reminds me of ""Apocalypse Now,"" where the journey was so great that the payoff could not possible be as good as what we anticipated.
I think most American viewers will have a preference for ""The Ring"" over ""Ringu,"" and not just because they would not have to deal with reading subtitles (""Ringu"" is not dubbed, nor does it appear likely that it ever will be).  Most of Reiko's key scenes involve a minimum of dialogue and rely more on the look of horror on her face, so it is not like you are really distracted by reading anything at key moments.  You will probably be struck by the more minimalist use of humor in this film.  But ""The Ring"" is basically ""Ringu"" crossed with a Nine Inch Nails music video (you know exactly which one I have in mind), although this refers more to the images on the videotape.  The American version has more images, which are more bizarre, and a bigger budget for making the climax gorier.
Of course it is difficult not to always be comparing the two films when you watch ""Ringu,"" but you will at least find it interesting.  How many Japanese horror movies have you seen lately?  How many of you have seen a Japanese film that was not anime or Akira Kurosawa?  You should be watching those (""Spirited Away"" and ""Grave of the Fireflies"" for the former, ""Rashomon"" and ""Seven Samurai"" for the latter), but you should be checking out films like ""Ringu"" as well.",1059696000,2,2929,4.432835820895522

Since more readers will have seen the remake, I do want to encourage viewers who haven't caught ""Ringu"" to do so for three major reasons: first, the spirit's motivations and roots are clearer while still maintaining the story's eerie ambiguity.  It moves beyond the ""Just because she's evil"" realm.  Second, the last choice made by the main character (dropped in the remake, my guess because it was thought too disturbing for an American audience) is brilliantly horrifying, and brings to life human frailty and the lengths desperation will take us.  And finally, because the finale, in which spirit and human meet face to face, is one of the most unsettling things I've ever seen in a film ... and I love being unsettled, so I've seen a lot of unsettling scenes.  The remake's version is also plenty effective, but the way the scene is filmed here - with something to suggest stop motion - will stay with me forever ... as will those fingernails.

1404206,4,B000058CB6,"Thank God there are still people who know how to make good horror movies-- this is one that will haunt you for days afterward.  There is a nice creepy atmosphere throughout the whole film, and some nice shock moments, especially at the end when you think the story is wrapping up.  Having said that, I do feel there are some problems with the plot, which leaves some things unexplained: 1) how the tape was made 2) whether the reporter has psychic visions at one point or just a vivid imagination 3) the title.  Also, someone does something in the final scene which seems a bit out of character (I would have thought there would be a better way to resolve the dilemma).  Still, this is a good old-fashioned frightfest that works without lots of gore or gratuitous special effects.
NOTE:  Before this film, there was a Japanese TV version made in 1996 which proved so popular it was released theatrically (Director: Chisui Takigawa; Cast: Katsunori Yakahashi, Ayane Miura, Yoshoi Harada, Tomoroh Taguchi).

1404215,4,B000058CB6,"Ringu is a very well made movie with an original idea. It is based on Koji Suzuki's novel (although it's plot deviates quite a bit). This, the original Japanese version, works on a completely different level than the US remake, The Ring. Ringu is more of a suspense film that succeeds in being sinister and very creepy. The Ring succeeds in being a well made Horror/mystery BUT it is important to remember that it is based on all three of the Japanese movies (Ring 0, Ring, and Ring 2) as well as the earlier Korean remake, not just on the original Ring (aka Ringu). Thus, it is not logical to compare 'The Ring' to 'Ringu', when it comes to deciding which one is better. While it is true that The Ring does consistently explain itself it must be said that for an American audience, this is often necessary because most of us are not accustomed to open-ended plot lines. In fact, many people had to see it a second time to fully understand it, including myself, despite complaints of ""spoon-feeding"" from some. In contrast to 'The Ring', Ringu is able to ground this fantastical story into a realistic setting. The Ring however is much more implausible, though that hardly detracts from the horror. If you are looking for an entertaining Horror/mystery that is visually stunning, not just in it's special effects, but also in it's cinematography, I recommend you watch 'The Ring' first. If you are looking for a dark, moody suspense film, and don't mind/enjoy cultural differences or reading subtitles, I recommend you watch 'Ringu' first. However it is important to remember that the movie you see first will detract from the effect of the movie you view second. Both are highly recommended.

1404217,4,B000058CB6,"This is the original Japanese version of the American ""The Ring.""
What is so striking about this Japanese version is that it is so lean, devoid of extraneous, supposedly illuminating detail. The Japanese get right to the meat of  a particular scene assuming that we will put the pieces together in our mind and therefore there is no reason to spell it out/hammer us over the head with extraneous exposition. In the process they anoint their audience with a lot more credit for being intelligent than do the Americans.
Another interesting point is that, in the American version, the Naomi Watts character is the main protagonist while her ex is merely eye-candy. But in this film Asagawa, the female lead shares the spotlight with her ex-husband who has a lot to do with the denouement and therefore the solving of the mystery.
As to the question, which version is scarier: it's a draw with the American version having a slight edge I think because the world of ""The Ring"" is more familiar to us than is that of  ""Ringu"" and as such we can relate more to the everyday horror of it.",1053648000,3,1080,4.619791666666667
1404218,5,B000058CB6,"There's no chance you haven't heard of 'The Ring', probably the only horror-movie to be a major box-office hit in years (and I'm not counting Wes Craven's recent efforts as horror because they're not!). It was worldfamous before it was even released. The concept was pretty freaky of course: when you watched this cursed video tape the phone would ring and a voice would say: Seven days, meaning you would die in ehm... yeah that's right, seven days. What some (or many, I don't really know actually) people don't know is that The Ring is a remake. The original Ring is a 1998 Japanese movie, but because Americans are too lazy to read subtitles plus the fact that a great part of them is too nationalist too withstand foreigners longer than an hour, this movie was remade into, yup, The Ring.
The original movie was based on the book Ring, by writer Suzuki Koji. The book was made into a tv-series at first in 1995. The series was named Ring: Kanzen-ban, but it was quite a disaster. In 1998 Nakata Hideo made a second attempt. This attempt was this movie, called 'Ring', after the book (Ringu in Japanese). And it turned out great, I can tell you. Although the book's story was changed here and there (and here, and there) these interventions didn't do the story any harm. The changes were drastic though; in the book Sadako was a sort of virus, in the movie she's a real girl. In the book the main character was a man, in the movie a woman. Talk about drastic changes! But as said, this wasn't bad. Not bad at all.
The storyline in short: There have been rumours that there's a cursed video somewhere, and everyone who watches it will get a phonecall. And seven days later, you'll die. When Reiko's (the main character) niece dies in a strange way after having seen the movie, Reiko (being a journalist) tries to find out more about this. She actually finds a weird tape and watches it. The images on the tape are disturbing and when the tape ends, the phone rings! Scary as hell! Of course Reiko has no intention of dying yet so she tries to stop the curse. This is just the plot in short and if it doesn't sound very creepy, believe me, this movie is!

1404223,4,B000058CB6,"I saw the American remake of ""The Ring"" this past summer and had high expectations.  It takes a lot of convincing for me to be scared by a horror film and the only recent movie that has sufficiently made me cringe in my seat was ""The Sixth Sense.""  Needless to say, the American remake of ""The Ring"" disappointed me.  It got off to a good start, the ""curse film"" was artistic, unsettling, and creepy, but I felt the remake's plotline became less and less frightening from that point on.  I understood the plot, but had questions as to why certain things were included in the movie.  I felt as though elements had been introduced in the storyline that were never answered.  In a way, I felt cheated.  They tried to tell too much story in too little time and got bogged down in the details.
Since watching that film, I'd heard many accounts that said ""Ringu"" was much better, much scarier than the American remake.  I was thrilled to find that ""Ringu"" had been released in conjunction with the remake.  Needless to say, ""Ringu"" scared me--a lot.  Though the story and effects of the original film are much simpler than that of the remake, I think it is better so.  So much more is left to the power of one's imagination rather than the power of special effects.  The plotline--even though questions remain in the mind of the viewer following the film's end--is satisfying and complete.  In the american remake, I grew tired of the protagonist having to whisper clues to us as if we the audience wouldn't pick up on them without her help.  In ""Ringu"", we aren't spoonfed in such a way.  It's definitely a more rewarding film experience.",1050710400,9,1633,4.563573883161512
1404224,5,B000058CB6,"Having not seen ""The Ring"", I chose to see this version---the original---instead. I have to say that true to the other reviews, ""Ringu"" is truly creepy. A bizarre urban legend about a weird and deadly video tape is discovered to be (gulp) true. And a journalist (who watched it) is on a race for her life (and her young son's) to get to the source. With the help of her psychic ex-husband, she tracks it down to an even more bizarre series of events that happened 40 yrs.ago. This film does creep you out and without all the obnoxious special effects and gore. It sets you up for the chills right from the beginning and doesn't let up. But it does so with seemingly normal and mundane things like the telephone ringing after watching the video, the weird video cassette itself with no title, static images on a TV screen, schoolgirls who know that the urban legend is true because their friends have died horribly (and no telling how many adults who won't believe them) and it appears they've been scared to death. Maybe these things have been done before but hardly this well. It all seems so fresh in ""Ringu"" that you find yourself getting edgy. Marvelous directing and acting, beautiful photography and an excellent music score with just the right creepiness in it. I loved it. And I loved the ending. Highly recommended all around.

You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear.  Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them.

The Ring overpowers you with special effects, especially in the scenes where, uh, bad things start happening.  The effects are so jarring they tend to throw you out of the movie.  Also, there is far more backstory in The Ring, and I think some of this is a bit overpowering also.  It gets in the way of the plot.  Ringu is more subtle, it relies more on the viewer's imagination.  There is at least one plot element that makes more sense in Ringu than the Ring, but I can't tell you what it is without giving away the plot.  Well, it has something to do with location.  Well, that's about all I can say about that.  If you like horror movies, then see Ringu before seeing The Ring.  There are no extras on the DVD of Ringu.  However, I think the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack on Ringu is extremely well done.  It is restrained--the back channels are not used that much, but when they are used they are used extremely effectively.  I found the effect almost dizzying in one scene. The video transfer looks very good.  One final note--there are scenes in The Ring that involve horses, and bad things happen to them.  If you dislike animal violence you will definitely like Ringu better than The Ring as these scenes do not exist in Ringu.  Ringu is not on the plane of Alien or Silence of the Lambs as a great horror movie, but it is original and fun and very well done.",1050537600,16,1466,4.390334572490707

1404230,5,B000058CB6,"Ringu is not The Ring.  It is the original film which The Ring is a remake of.  Ringu does not have the flash, the flare, and the shocks that The Ring has, but this film does not need any of that to effectively creep out its viewers.  It is a quiet film that slowly goes about explaining itself, while refraining from answering all the questions to the story.  The viewer is meant not to know everything about the shady past from which the cursed video tape came from.
The important thing, however, is the race to solve the mystery of the tape before its too late.  As legend goes, once you watch it, you only have seven days to live.  Reiko Asakawa, a single mother and reporter, watches the tape and must hurry to save herself and the lives of those she shows the tape to.  The story is very similar to that of The Ring, but The Ring elaborates greatly on Ringu.  The cast for Ringu is very strong.  Much stronger, in my opinion, than the cast for the Ring.  The people seemed more realistic, more natural, except that we are let on to one of the characters having psychic abilities.  Luckily, it's not the little boy.
Now comes the million dollar question.  What's scarier, The Ring, or Ringu?  It all depends on which you see first.  These movies are so similar, once you've seen one, you know how the other will turn out.  Some may find it easier to jump during The Ring however, due to all the added special effects.  There are no flashy effects and loud noises in Ringu.  The fear is much more subtle than that.  Still, while I myself saw The Ring first, it was hard not to get creeped out by Sadako's twitchy, jerking movements as she slinked across the room.",1049587200,6,1667,4.357142857142857

Second, the movie did not show a SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD, but it can have the same horrible effect to leave you unsleep for nights.  (I was truly scared when my phone rang at midnight during those months!!)  It teaches Hollywood how to make a good horror movie without using banging soundtrack and bloodshed.  Finally, please grab a copy of the original novel to read.
The whole saga of RING has four parts - RING, RAISEN and LOOP (reprise the theme of 'circular' like RING) and BIRTHDAY.  For the movie - we have RINGU, RAISEN, RINGU 2, RINGU 0.  The author Suzuki-san mentioned in the introduction of RAISEN that it was very difficult for him to write a sequel to RINGU, since the first one has already got a very complicate plot.  But he sure can create a true mesmerizing sequel.
In summary, RAISEN is about the rebirth of Sadako.  RINGU 2 (movie only) is a somewhat parallel sequel to RINGU, with a different splitting storyline after the movie of RINGU.  RINGU 0 is the prequel to RINGU and is about the life of Sadako as a child, which based on the book BIRTHDAY.  And for LOOP, it is a collection of short stories which talks about the widespread of RING virus, and probable termination of mankind.  Yes, in RING, you may believe that the deaths are caused by CURSE in the video tape.  But in RAISEN, the author cleverly developed the plot that RING is actually a virus triggered by the curse!!

1404233,4,B000058CB6,"The obvious problem created by the American DVD release of the 1998 Japanese film, ""Ringu"" is that most American viewers with interest in seeing it will have already seen ""The Ring"" prior to watching the original version.
While there is clearly a debate over whether or not the original is better than last year's American remake, comparing the films is ultimately pointless given how similar they are.
Unlike many remakes that use the original source material strictly as a jumping off point to go in a slightly or vastly different direction (think Steven Soderbergh's remake of ""Ocean's Eleven""), ""The Ring"" is essentially a shot by shot remake of ""Ringu.""  In fact, some of the ""cursed"" video footage used in ""The Ring"" actually seems to have been lifted directly from the earlier film.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing but many American viewers seeing ""Ringu"" for the first time will undoubtedly experience a sense of ""been there, done that.""
The remake, with its vastly superior makeup and special effects budget, clearly ups the ante on the gore quotient in comparison with the micro-budgeted Japanese version.  Additionally, ""The gray, rainy Seattle setting of ""The Ring"" does more to create an atmosphere of omnipresent dread than the often sunny, urban Japanese locale of the original.
But ""Ringu"" is still an extremely competent and well-made film that delivers its own scares on a shoestring budget. In fact, I actually appreciated the subtlety of the Japanese original's horror to the occasionally ham-fisted shocks of ""The Ring.""
For a really fun night, get some open-minded friends together and watch both movies back to back.  I guarantee you'll have a ball comparing the similarities and differences between the two versions.
My only complaint is that this US release, which has clearly been timed to coincide with the DVD release of ""The Ring,""(both versions have been issued by Dreamworks) is woefully short on extras.  Nevertheless, after previewing the film by rental first, I can safely say that for viewers who want the complete ""Ring"" experience ""Ringu"" is worth the price of purchase.",1048982400,4,2110,5.125

The american version of this, ""The Ring"", is based very strongly on this movie.  Many of the parts are very, very much alike.  But what a lot of people hated were the sub titles.  I personally would rather have subtitles then bad voice overs where the actors mouths aren't even moving with the words.  Another thing is people say that it is boring.  Well, if you think that this is boring, then you should think that ""The Ring"" is boring too, because it is like I said, pretty much the exact same story.
""Ringu"" is a little more creepy in my eyes.  The music, which there isn't much of, is more on the lines of Kubricks ""The Shining"".  Also, as I said before, the story is a little different.  I actually liked the story a little better than that of the American version.  Although, the only reason they are different i think, is because of the different cultures and areas that we live in.  The story behind ""Ringu"" is definetly a little spookier.
Dont expect to be really freaked out by this movie, or the American version either.  But be prepaired to have chills.  I would have to say that this is a good edition to your DVD collection along with ""The Ring"".  Plus, this version does end a little better.

1404235,4,B000058CB6,"I saw this movie before it was recently remade by Hollywood. Since it never received a real release in North America I watched ""Ringu"" (which was then translated ""the Ring"" but now I guess the American remakes takes title precedence) with a friend who owns an impressive collection of Japanese bootleg films. But now that Hollywood has released its inferior simulacra the American corporations have now deemed that ""Ringu"" would be profitable.
 This ideology of remaking foreign films that were never widely distributed in North America has always bugged me.  Hollywood is out of new ideas (and has been for a long time) and so it has recently begun remaking films from its past or, better yet, stealing ideas from foreign filmmakers hoping that an ethnocentric audience will think that the American filmmakers are ""original"" or ""inventive"". (Other recent examples include ""Solaris"" [yes I know it was a book by Lem, but it is obvious that the film was actually a remake of Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" and I doubt the director actually read the book], and ""Insomnia"".)  And when they don't steal films they blatantly rip-off scenes from other movies.
 And so I would hasten to say that everyone should watch ""Ringu"" and if, as some consumers think, it does not appear as ""good"" as ""the Ring"" then you are missing the point entirely. the remake is unoriginal and uninspired; without its high-budget, eyecandy shooting it would not be scary. (I think most people are conditioned to be afraid of a certain hollywood horror aesthetic.) ""Ringu"", on the other hand, is brilliant because the director does not let his ideas take back seat to budget constraints and eyecandy.
  I still enjoy ""Ringu"" (which I still call ""the Ring"", new version be damned) and, despite my annoyance about it having not been made available earlier, am happy that it can now be purchased.",1048723200,,1854,4.945337620578778
1404236,2,B000058CB6,"I gotta give RINGU credit for originating this brilliant idea. And everyone knows 9 times outta 10 the original will always surpass the remake. But this time I really have to take the opposing view. It was really hard for me to take this one more seriously, it did seem cheesier. Maybe it was the subtitles READING that a tape kills you in seven days rather then HEARING the lines being read. I was also surprised to see that the U.S. remake is almost a scene per scene carbon copy of this movie, which makes one wonder if they were just lazy or if they really wanted to keep intact and respect the original film. The lead roles in both films are good, and I like how the kid in RINGU was still weird but not OVER THE TOP weird  like in the US version. (honestly does ANYONE know a kid who's that depressing?)
RINGU was more of a mystery and less  scarier then the U.S. version. Overall both keep intact the trippy scene at the end where...well not to ruin it but the killer makes an awesome appearance, that will certainly be spoofed and become a horror classic.
Overall RINGU was not as suspensful and not as scary as the U.S. Ring. That's my opinion, or maybe I was tained because I saw the U.S. version first. But to RINGU's credit it was the originator and the idea was really good but The Ring got the horror and suspense aspects which made it a much more entertaining film.",1048464000,,1380,4.324324324324325

I saw RING first and thoroughly enjoyed it, so hearing RINGU was scarier i was very excited. I see absolutley NO comparision. The RING(USA version) was so much scarier creepier and better acted by far! The lead woman in RINGU was very good however and the little girl walking towards the TV in RINGU twitching while she walked was extremely creepy. I guess this is a fun thing and a matter of taste. I guess everyone should watch both, but the question is now which one first because it seems like u won't like the second. Well if you are in USA get the remake then i guess.

1404240,5,B000058CB6,"I'll be the great reconciliator here - I have heard such vehement reviews of this Ring and the American ""The Ring"", each taking one side or the other, but I liked them both!  I saw the Japanese version (Ringu) first and liked it so much I decided to see the American version.  I was very happy to find that the American version decided to take a different approach, though in the parts that were the same as the Japanese, they often were the same shot for shot.  It was very masterfully done, I thought.
  The Japanese version will probably suit you better if you 1)Don't mind subtitles 2)Don't mind references to supernatural phenomena (although, really, folks, if Sadako/Samara can psychically transmit her hatred to video tape, you have to allow for some psychic material elsewhere!).  The Japanese version is not a ""shocker"" kind of horror, but a creepy-crawly kind.  It did make me a little afraid of TVs for a while.
  So my question is, those of you that have seen the Universal Studios DVD rerelease, how is this version?  I have seen an older version, and am curious how this DVD stacks up compared to the European releases.",1047945600,2,1133,4.648241206030151

Started falling asleep halfway through.  Storyline is very similar to The Ring but the American version is better executed.
Of the storylines that were different:  1.  it made no sense; or 2. I didn't understand what was going on (good thing I saw the American version).

1404242,2,B000058CB6,"Well here I am, just starting to watch The Ring, and already the teenager count is not good.  The flick is a few seconds in and we're at two teenage girls and counting.  And so I decide I'm gonna flip on Ringu and do a scene by scene comparison to see if maybe I should start watching Ringu instead.
So I flip on Ringu on the VCR while I still got The Ring cooking on pause in the DVD.  I watch the first scene of Ringu, switch back to The Ring, watch another scene from Ringu, ditto for The Ring... you get the idea.  So pretty soon I come to the conclusion that the pictures are pretty much the same except the Japanese version is set in Japan and full of Japanese people speaking Japanese.  And another difference is that the teenage girl that gets worked over in the first scene, you know, after some shenanigans with the TV after she claims to her friend she saw the killer videotape and then changes her story and says she didn't?  Well, in the Japanese version, the nameless menace that kills her off seems to come out of her refrigerator.  And in both versions it is utterly unclear what the frig is going on.  I mean you have these teenage girls claiming first that they saw the killer tape, then making like it was all a put on, then they keel over and you're left with the feeling that maybe they were sincere when they said they saw the killer video but then started backpedaling for reasons unknown.  In the american version, the moribund girl has some bad dealings with the TV, then goes upstairs in search of her friend and opens the door to a bedroom to find the killer tape playing on the TV.  She drops dead.  Which is strange to me, since according to the legend, the tape is watched and then you keel over seven days later, mysteriously.  There was no mention of being subjected to the tape yet again.  So maybe it makes more sense for the Japanese chick to get taken out by her refrigerator.",1047945600,,1912,4.2924791086350975
1404243,5,B000058CB6,"Ringu, the Japanese precursor to The Ring, is perhaps the scariest movie made so far in the 21st century. Combining the typical lore of an urban legend with extrasensory manipulation of modern media, the theme is well-geared for our times.
Many people will want to compare Ringu with The Ring, and in all fairness - and without giving away entire plot points (yet) - there are some pros and cons to each. The Ring adds more background and psychological motive than Ringu does. Ringu is less graphic in its horror, yet somehow manages to be scarier. And several circumstances are different between The Ring and Ringu, but most differences are primarily to suit the countries and environments each takes place in, and these are entirely reasonable differences.
But ultimately, I must cast my lot with Ringu, and for me it was not so much from comparing The Ring and Ringu, but finding some more abstract parallels between Ringu and another Japanese film called Tatsuo (The Iron Man), made in 1989.
I am not recommending Tatsuo to all viewers of Ringu or The Ring, but if you are an adult who can stomach subtitles, black-and-white art films, gothic horror, and a lot of dizzying stop-motion, and you have a sense of humor, you might rent Tatsuo just to see an uncanny foreshadowing of Ringu.
Tatsuo concerns a male main character who attempts to flee, and to stave off the attacks of, a female entity who seems to be half human and half technological/robotic nightmare...perhaps part demon, too. The male character starts the movie by cramming a metal rod into his leg, perhaps as a sort of anti-venom to temporarily ward off the mechanical ""infection"" that the female is spreading. The female entity's aggression is vaguely vampiric, and even takes on blatantly sexual overtones as she attempts to infect the male character. She eventually succeeds, and the male character gradually devolves out of humanity (or evolves to a higher state, from the machines' standpoint). None of this is clearly defined or articulated for the viewer, so most people will not enjoy this movie. But there are those of you (and you know who you are) who will ...
But Tatsuo, Ringu, and The Ring all center around themes where evil is a plague of sorts, spread by mechanism. Technology becomes the vector for infection, and these plagues have their victims - and their carriers. But the other important connection is that in each film, the most successful and horrific moments are also the least well-explained. For most people, the lack of clear logical plotline and explanation makes Tetsuo unwatchable. But for many others, The Ring will come across as trying too hard to go the other way, applying a science and rationale to what unfolds, so much so that its own ""rules"" trip it up in a few places. Ringu seems to stand in the balance; its ultimate strength is in giving us a sufficiently coherent plot, but not telling us too much about how things work, or even why. Events are largely left to unfold as they will.",1047772800,5,2997,4.7988394584139265
1404244,4,B000058CB6,"As everyone knows by now due to the marketing efforts of Dreamworks and associates Ringu was the Japanese film upon which the American film The Ring was based. I rented both one evening and watched them back to back. On the recommendation of my friendly video rental person I watched The Ring first (his preference) and then Ringu.
The Ring was a very good movie; atmospherically wet and moody, and wonderfully shot. However I had several unanswered questions at the end and I was transfixed but never really frightened.
Ringu on the other hand provided a complete story and left no holes unexplored or unexplained. And while not as well shot it left me oddly uneasy with that delicious better-look-under-the-bed feeling as all good horror films do.
So of the two films Ringu would get my vote for a purchase, and The Ring would remain a rental.",1047513600,4,845,4.755102040816326
1404245,1,B000058CB6,"I watched The Ring with two of my friends. By the end of the first scene, my friends (college guys) were holding each other. And I was genuinely creeped out, which was a first for me. In fact, I went home that night and spent the hours until sunrise researching Ringu. Every review I read said it was scarier than The Ring. Now, considering that I was reading this at 4 AM because The Ring convinced me that closing my eyes meant certain death, scarier than that seemed pretty durn scary. So we watched Ringu. I fell asleep halfway through.
Here's the problem: Ringu might be great for a Japanese audience that's never seen it before, but for an English speaker that's already seen The Ring, Ringu couldn't compare.
* The Ring captured all the creepiness of Ringu but with some great effects to drive it home. I mean, the *title menu* on The Ring DVD freaked me out. And the hidden feature is probably the best use of DVD technology to date
* Setting the mood for a scary movie is hard enough when the audience and the creators speak the same language. Adding the extra layer of translation and the fact that your eyes are always constanly glued to the subtitles at the bottom of the screen really kept me out of the movie. For that matter, the American cursed video was much weirder than Japanese one. Maybe Japanese people are scared by guys with towels over their heads, but I don't think the average American is.
* The story is more involving in The Ring - you have to earn clues along with the characters. None of this ""This guy is a psychic, just follow him.""
So in conclusion, anyone who tells you Ringu is better is leaning toward being an arthouse snob, the type that thinks that because a movie is made in a different country it is automatically better. Don't believe the hype. Ringu may have been the scariest movie ever made in Japan, but The Ring is the scariest movie ever made.",1047427200,19,1892,4.439655172413793
1404246,5,B000058CB6,"No special effects, no bloodshed, no overt violence of any kind in this film, a sense of menace in every scene all the way throughout. I made the mistake of watching this alone in the dark at night by myself, and it scared me enough to keep me up for a while. I don't recommend you do this. Watch the film during the day, with plenty of sunshine around you. And after you do, stay away from the TV!
Ringu (remade as The Ring in the US in 2002) is frightening becasue of what can happen more than what is actually shown. It's basically a detective story with an ellusive supernatural foe. It got to me, this film, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes films like The Exorcist, The Omen, films that make you think.
Ringu spawned two sequels and was a huge hit in Japan before making its way for an inevitable sequel over here. If you've seen the remake, take a look at the original and compare. If you haven't seen either, then you're in for a real treat.",1047340800,,965,4.25
1404247,5,B000058CB6,"'Ringu' tells the tale of a video tape that, for reasons unknown, that kills you seven days after you watch it.
Reiko, a journalist, is greeted by a death in the family one day. Her teenage niece died mysteriously one day, leaving no trace as to why. She soon discovers that three other of her niece's close friends died on the same day as her. Upon further investigation, she finds that the four teenagers had something in common: they had all seen a cryptic video tape. The trail leads her to the tape itself and, out of curiosity, watches it. The urban legend is proven to be a lot more real than she ever expected and soon, Reiko is on a race against time to decipher the mysteries of the tape.
'Ringu' (viewed at home) achieves a sense of fear throughout the movie in the way it 'connects' with the viewer. How obvious can it get? Though not a tape, you're watching the DVD on a TV. This paranoia adds to the scares constantly.
With sparse use of any real 'special effects,' the film is able to ground its otherworldly story to reality, something few modern horror films are able to do.
The acting is great and the dialogue, or at least the translated script for the subtitles, never got repetitive. The actress for Reiko does a good job as the tense heroine, while the male lead actor (sorry, his name escapes me) contrasts very well with her as her often cool and relaxed ex-husband.
The music chills to the bone, particularly the main theme (plays on the DVD main menu), which is just a creepy concoction of strummed guitar strings. I sat there, letting the whole menu run its course as the ambience it gave off made my blood run ice cold. 'Ringu's great utilization of sound astounded me as well, using bursts of utter cacophony to add new layers of fright to already surprsingly horrifying scenes.
Quite simply, this movie impressed me in every way possible.
Now, on to 'Ringu'/'The Ring' comparisons...
'Ringu' operates on a single word: subtlety.
It delivers the scares without convoluting the process. Fear without frills, as I say. They scare you moreso on a mental level, forever burning in (some cases only) a dread of TV's.
Take, for example, the tape itself. In 'Ringu,' it really is just a bunch of forboding images, adding only clues to plot. Short and sweet.
In comparison, 'The Ring' goes for the throat. It does try to scare you at a mental level as well, but it is somewhat bogged down by its own attempt of quick shocks.
The tape, in this version, is much longer and thought it is adapted for plot purposes, certain parts were unnecessary and served only to provide more reasons fo disturbing imagery later on.
Most importantly, one character in particular was altered in a way I didn't like, but which take is better really just depends on personal taste.
That would be the journalist's son. In 'Ringu,' he had this creepy robotic feel, speaking only when needed and showing a frightening air of maturity.
However, in 'The Ring,' though well-acted, he is portrayed as the 'cliche' horror film child. He spouts out insightful but scary things that he should know nothing about at his age (ie the little boy in 'Signs'). This take removes the vulnerablity his counterpart had in 'Ringu,' causing you to care less whether or not he dies.
Ending my comparison, I believe 'Ringu' is the superior film, though both in and of themselves are great.
Now to end with the DVD package:
The main menu keeps in line with the film's simple way of fright, using the main theme as its backgroud music. The scene division is well-done. The 5.1 remaster of the film looks great as well. My only complaint is the disappointing lack of the 'Ringu' trailers.
I say 'Ringu' is a sure buy and I guarantee (to most people) that you will not be disappointed. Just don't come crying to me when you develop an unhealthy fear of televisions!",1047254400,50,3838,4.604379562043795

Needless to say, I couldn't sleep a wink last night.  Perhaps my imagination is too impressionable, but Ringu affected me pretty strongly and from what I gather in my reseach on the Web today, a number of others have had the same experience!

DreamWorks Home Entertainment has taken the unusual step of marketing its classy-but-creepy ""Ring"" along with a same-day release of the original 1998 Japanese film, the equally disturbing ""Ringu.""
The ""Ring"" cycle makes a lot of sense -- while the original certainly delivers on its dark reputation, the remake has nothing to lose from direct comparison. Both are horror films for adults and thinking teens, more psychologically threatening than relentlessly violent.  ""Ringu"" haunted a few U.S. film festivals but has gone largely unseen here until this video release.
The Japanese film benefits from a narrative drive and coherence that the U.S. version lacks. Some of the ghostly imagery (like the ghostly long-haired female) make a lot more sense in the Asian context. The Japanese film stars the terrific actress Nanako Matsushima in the Naomi  Watts role. The male lead, Sanada Hiroyuki, adds power to ""Ringu,"" while ""Ring"" remains mostly Watts' show.
On the down side, the Japanese film suffers from some cheesy effects and modest production values. Director Hideo Nakata's rendering of what's on the death tape doesn't amount to much. No matter, you'll be too freaked out to worry about it.
""Ringu,"" working with a small budget and no special effects of note, has a handsome but soft look helped along by a new high-definition master. Aspect ratio is 1.85:1.

It is a supremely suspenseful flick, transforming everyday settings into scenes of impending menace.  The music contributes much to the mood, and the entire movie has an underlying sense of danger, infused by a filmic sensibility quite different from that of velocity-crazed America.
I'm not a horror fan, as such, but a film buff--and ""Ringu"" filled my late Saturday night quite well . . .",1047081600,,517,4.875
1404252,4,B000058CB6,"I was going to try and review ""Ringu"" without doing a compare and contrast with its American remake, ""The Ring"". However, it is very hard to do, especially since most people who check this film out have most likely seen ""The Ring"", and want to compare it to the original. One reviewer said your favorite of the two probably depends on which one you saw first. I'd probably have to agree. I saw ""The Ring"" first.
""Ringu"", without comparing it to ""The Ring"", stands very well on its own. It's really the first foreign film I've seen that is a horror movie, and it was made quite well. The idea is original - a cursed videotape that gives everyone who watches it a seven-day death sentence. While investigating the mysterious death of her niece, a young reporter stumbles upon this tape and has seven days to figure out where it came from, what it means, and how to lift the curse that's on it.
Okay, now that we have the plot, here is the compare and contrast: There are a number of scenes in ""Ringu"" that are nearly mirrored in ""The Ring"", but other than that, there are quite a few differences. First of all, the tape. The tape in ""Ringu"" is a lot shorter than the one in ""The Ring"" - and a lot less creepy. Watching the tape in the latter, I was left with an unsettling feeling, which I believe was the purpose of it; in ""Ringu"", it didn't creep me out nearly as much. However, a lot of things were added to the one in ""The Ring"", and some of the images don't seem to make sense, whereas ""Ringu"" just cuts to the chase. ""Ringu"" seems like a brighter film; there are even a few scenes outside in the sun. ""The Ring"" was far more dark and gloomy, which I thought made it seem creepier. However, despite the fact that ""Ringu"" is a little more than an hour and a half, and ""The Ring"" was nearly two hours, ""Ringu"" managed to explain itself better. I was completely confused after watching ""The Ring"", and was still confused after ""Ringu"", but the original seemed to make more sense. Neither really explained how the tape came into existence, or why it is cursed, but ""Ringu"" explained the last scene better. I still don't get it, but maybe I'm not supposed to. Visually, ""The Ring"" is better, mainly because of the bigger budget. Still, ""Ringu"" looks pretty good, too.
""Ringu"" and ""The Ring"" are the same, yet completely different. I have to wonder what I would have thought of ""Ringu"" had I seen it before ""The Ring"". Would I have liked it more? It's hard to tell. I like both films, but in the end, I think ""The Ring"" is the version that is going to stick with me the most. I know, I know, it was strictly Hollywood, with a big budget and a lot of hype, with more special effects; I just think that ""The Ring"" took the great idea from the original, took its spookiness and turned it into something even better. But without ""Ringu"", ""The Ring"" would have never existed. I guess that says a lot about the original. If you liked ""The Ring"", I recommend you check this one out. Maybe rent it first, just to make sure. It's always fun to compare remakes with the original (another good one: ""Vanilla Sky"" vs. ""Open Your Eyes""). But no matter which one you like more, you will still probably want to sleep with the lights on.",1047081600,,3218,4.365
1404253,4,B000058CB6,"Both Ringu and The Ring are fine examples of scary movies. They are two slightly different movies. Remember, the ring was inspired by the first, it doesn't mean it has to be exactly the same. Ringu was scary and I think Gore V. added a little extra to the very original and interesting story. I also love the fact that the movie itself never tried to have a happy ending, it never tried to ""wrap things up"" in the end. It also left alot of brain teasers about the origins a secret. This allows people to use their imaginations, nothing is more effective than playing on your own fears.",1046908800,,585,4.376146788990826
1404254,4,B000058CB6,"Ringu is basically deserving of its reputation as a near-masterpiece of quiet, subtle horror.  If you like unconventional, ambiguous creep-outs like Picnic at Hanging Rock or the first half of Lost Highway (which, come to think of it, also involves some very unsettling videotapes) you'll probably appreciate this film.  I'd recommend this over the American remake, although I don't agree with those that find Gore Verbinski's version vastly inferior.  In fact, it's surprisingly well done, my only real complaint being the predictable tendency to tone down the ambiguity.  For instance, the death-dealing video in the Japanese version consists of a series of bizarre images that are never explained.  In the American version (The Ring), the images, although just as bizarre, are all eventually neatly tied up with the narrative, each one being assigned an explicit meaning.  It was a bad move that aptly illustrates the general lack of faith that Hollywood has in the intelligence/imagination of American moviegoers.  Also, although fairly well done in The Ring, the climactic scare scene just isn't as hair-raising as it is in Ringu.  Anyway, if you're interested in seeing both versions, I'd recommend starting with the slower, subtler original.",1046908800,9,1248,5.364102564102564
1404255,4,B000058CB6,"I saw The Ring the other night and gave it a 2 star rating as one of the most over-hyped movies in a long time. I'm glad i saw it, though, and enjoyed the creepy mood and atmosphere of it, but i didn't think it was the scariest movie of all time like so many of the five star reviews were saying.  I had a big problem with how the movie was hard to figure out in parts and there were many unanswered questions that left me with an unsatisfied feeling. Plus, i didn't buy the explaination for how the images got on the tape at all. Thankfully, i was able to see Ringu, which had the effect of fixing the focus on a blurry picture and making everything crystal clear. Not only was Ringu a better story and went in a different and more enjoyable direction than the story The Ring was trying to tell, but it all made 100% sense by the end of the movie and cleared up all the unanswered questions i'd had about The Ring. The explaination in Ringu for the reason behind the images appearing on the tape was believable. Also, Ringu didn't drag the way The Ring did. Technically, The Ring looked better, but that was only because of the millions of dollars difference in the budget. Considering Ringu was made on a shoestring budget, i'd say they did a great job of it. The scene where the girl comes through the tv made sense in Ringu due to the different approach to the story and the explaination of things, whereas in The Ring it just looked like a Hollywood afterthought that was tagged on for shock purposes. The way it was done in Ringu was also ten times  scarier than in The Ring, and the music during that part was scarier too. Ringu also helped explain the epilogue in The Ring that had made no sense to me at all. I really didn't like the way the story was handled and altered in The Ring. They added parts to it that just ended up confusing me. My advice would be to skip The Ring totally and watch Ringu instead. It may not be Hollywood material for all you people who depend on cgi effects and huge big budgets, but the story of Ringu is much more enjoyable to follow and made a hell of a lot more sense than The Ring.",1046822400,35,2125,4.193154034229829
1404256,5,B000058CB6,"I heartily agree with the luxurious anxieties expressed below, but wish to clarify a few things which may seem unclear (not that I am opposed to lack of clarity.) Ringu, aka Ring or Ring 1, was made in tandem with Spiral (which we might call Ring 1.5.)
Spiral was less than the overwhelming success expected at the box office (which happens when you try to compete with yourself), so the makers moved quickly to Ring 2, which pretended that 1.5 never happened, and is a direct sequel to Ring 1. So far, so good. Then along comes Ring O, a fine movie but lacking the shattering brilliance of the first two, though retaining the atmosphere and sense of unease. Ring 0 is of course the ""prequel,"" and answers all the questions you already strongly suspected the answers to, while adding a few dozen of its own. The proper order of viewing should be (beg to differ): Ring 1, Ring 2 (which provides devastating new information in the first five minutes, info which is reprised more overtly but less effectively at the end of Ring 0, which should be viewed last.) Spiral is I understand now more-or-less available on DVD, and I will forego speculation on its merits.
Meanwhile, I've noticed about a dozen thematic devices in Ringu
(and more in 2 and O), ranging from the traditional Japanese figures of ""the woman with long hair"" and ""the woman in the well"" to death by phone and death by video to Carrie and creepy killer kids. This list is far from exhaustive. It should all be a mess, and in some ways it is, but it doesn't really matter because here the supernatural is strongly present yet without clear causation or rational interconnection. It just is, so you can run but you can't hide. And being a nice person earns no mercy. I haven't seen the Hollywood remake, nor have I seen the Korean. Will do so, but I'm in no hurry.",1046304000,,1826,4.519637462235649
1404257,5,B000058CB6,"Why they kept the ""u"" in the title I do not know, it isn't even pronounced since the movie was titled using the English language in Japanese script, it doesn't make sense, but an easy mistake.
This movie is the original, it tells the tale of a curse laid down by the tormented soul of Sadako, a girl who was fathered by something that may not have been human, had stranbge powers and eventually cast down a well and left to die.  Her curse reaches out through a video tape that causes those who watch it to die exactly 7 days to the very second after having viewed it.  This movie tells of Reiko, a journalist who's niece has just died a terrifying death, she begins to investigate the giurl;s death and stumbles onto a oath that could end her life throug hactions of her own.  She watches the video tape that killed her niece and gets a strange call, she has 7 days to live.
The movie is told more through character development, drama and suspence, I found it more believable than the remake (The Ring), those that do not link with this version so well need t odo a little research on Japanese mythology and their traditional forms of monsters and how they were said to co-exist with humans.
With the other 2 movies, it becomes more apparent that Sadako is a tragic figure rather a ruthless one as Samara is in The Ring.
Truly the best horror ever, sadly ruined by the remake (the the latter is als ogood, it pales next to this).  This is one movie that had me unplugging my tv and VCR so I could sleep at night ;)",1046044800,20,1515,4.286713286713287
1404258,5,B000058CB6,"Before I begin, I just want to say, I have also reviewed the American remake  and also rated it 5 stars.  I feel that I can do this simply because, after I had watched it and its predecessor, I felt like I had watched two films with only their most basic premise in common; therefore, comparing the two, I feel, is completely unfair.  Both movies were fabulous in their own respects.
In The Ring, I thought that the minute-and-a-half embellishment of the first scene was a great touch (with the water pooling under the door, etc.) and I also enjoyed the almost-purposefully campy acting of the two actresses involved as it seemed, to me, to make fun of other American teen horror flicks.  As for the rest of the movie, poorly scripted dialogue and mediocre acting was the major downfall (how this could happen when Ringu's dialogue was so excellent I will never understand) - In Ringu, however, the acting seemed much more realistic, even in the first scene, and the resultant setup was also very effective.
Second, the video in the remake is almost TEN TIMES more unsettling to watch than the one in Ringu- it reminded me of a demented student art film... the video in Ringu is about a fourth as long and, while its mere ambiguity is creepy, I was rather unimpressed with it.
Third- the subsequent storylines are wildly different except for their culminations and each is likeable in its own respects- I like Ringu's storyline, once again, for its creepy ambiguity, but I think that The Ring gains a point here plotwise because I LOVED the idea that the main characters would seek the origin of the tape and find out more about Samara's (Sadako's) life.  It was fascinating and SUPERBLY creepy, and I liked all of the embellishments in that area.
Finally, and as much as I hate to say it, I enjoyed the special effects of the remake (expecially in the last scene).  Did it seem to anyone else that, in Ringu, Sadako looked rather... clean?  Just my opinion.
Point is- both had good, creepy atmosphere, and good storylines.  Scenes from the remake are, in my opinion, done better.  Acting in the remake suffers, and this takes MUCH away from the overall movie.  Acting in the original is superb- top-notch; therefore, the rest of the movie is very enjoyable, and make up for the places where special effects, etc. were used in the remake and subsequently seem to lack when watching the original.
My advice: see both, and don't make up your mind about one until you HAVE seen both.  You will not be bored: they are hardly similar.  I really think that how you will view these movies depend on what you appreciate in cinema- I appreciate art and cinematography, which was embellished in the remake, but I also appreciate subtlety and ambiguity, which is rampant in the original (not to say that both don't contain some of the other...).  Both approaches to the story are very intriguing.  I really enjoyed both movies, and see no need to compare them with each other.",1045958400,37,2965,4.655172413793103
1404259,5,B000058CB6,"I've long been a fan of Asian cinema, and I'd heard about RINGU for a few years but hadn't seen it until recently. In fact, I deliberately avoided the US remake until I'd seen the original. Anyway, I ordered the original trilogy (RING, RING 2 and RING 0) and watched them all over the course of a few nights.
While not exactly living up to the breathless hype that I've found all over the internet, RINGU nonetheless succeeds greatly in its ability to draw you in and keep you feeling awfully uncomfortable as you wait for unpleasant things to befall the cast. The antagonist (protagonist?) Sadako is one of the most memorable and terrifying characters that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. I've always been a fan of the ""ambiguous"" storyline, and the fact that there's a lot to RINGU that isn't easily explained was very refreshing. Too many Hollywood movies hold your hand and explain every little thing, which only insults my intelligence. I'm glad that there's a sense of mystery mixed in with the dread, which RINGU delivers in spades. Highly recommended.
The first sequel, RING 2, picks up where the first one left off. We see some familiar characters, and there's an emphasis on the scientific study and explanation of Sadako's supernatural power. Not quite as creepy as the first film, but it does have its unsettling moments; one in particular that involves the appearance of Sadako's mother Shizuko. A fine continuation of the story, but not exactly essential.
Which brings us to RING 0, which is actually a prequel to the first film. It has a slightly different style to it (different director) and the focus is on character development and interaction. It's more or less Sadako's story (complete with one of the most gut wrenching tragic endings I've ever seen) and it sheds light on who (and what) she was while painting her in a very sympathetic light. The actress who plays Sadako was riveting and draws you into her world from the moment you see her. It's a very emotional film, and by the time the end credits came up I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. No overt gore, no sex, no nudity, just an attention to subtleties that works magnificently. The first time we see the Sadako that we know from the first film was one of the creepiest sequences I've ever sat through. I literally had chills. Essential viewing.
Therefore, my recommendation is to watch RINGU, then RING 0, and then RING 2. At least that's how I'd have done it had I known better. In that order, the narrative is better and the viewer's relationship with the characters (especially Sadako) is much more enhanced. Unforgettable characters, highly imaginative story, expertly crafted filmmaking. Wish there were more like these.",1045353600,14,2729,4.7716701902748415

And for your information, the have 3 Ringus, the prequel, Ring 0, Ringu, and Ring 2. Ring 0 is the life of Sadako, Ring 2 is when recording the tape becomes useless. There's your element.

Too LOW budget? It fascinates me how they managed to make a horror film without much special effects. that's how you separate the good film makers from the bad. I watched this movie in a theatre, after I watched the remake. That was the time I realized that the remake was [poor] and was nothing like original. The soundtrack was awesome too.

1404261,5,B000058CB6,"I had first seen the original Japenese version of the ring two years ago and was actualy afraid to walk around my house in the dark. The last time that happened was when I saw the Blob at five years old. This movie is just plain creepy and the suspense is almost too much to bear towards the end of the movie. The atmosphere of the landscapes in every scene in the movie has an eerie feel about. For instance when the main character drops off her son at his grandfathers house, you may think that this is a happy and safe place, but I just had that feeling that something scary was going to jump out from around the corner at any moment. I felt uneasy with every beautiful backdrop. I am not here to bicker about whether or not this version is better than the American remake because I think that the each hold an interesting perspective and are pretty effective at scaring the audience. I do however, think that everybody that saw the American remake should see this version because this is an effectively creepy movie without the big budget (unlike the blair witch that was just dumb)and it is interesting to do a sort of cross cultural analysis. There are some interesting cultural biases presented in each. I don't know if this American version is going to have English dubbing, but you should see it in it's native tongue since it just adds to the mystique of that cursed videotape.",1043712000,9,1387,4.464566929133858
1404262,5,B000058CB6,"*
Although it upsets me somewhat that this DVD is being released by Universal Studios (which will more than likely result in them plastering their own corporate logo at the opening and ending credits and likely removing the original Japanese studio logos and credits), I am most pleased that FINALLY they are going to offer this original masterpiece in a crisp, high quality ''Region-1'' DVD!
Previously, when DreamWorks SKG purchased the rights to remake their American version of this film (as ''The Ring''), they subsequently pressured other distributors to discontinue marketing ''Regionless'' DVDs of this original Japanese title out of fear that we here in the US just might get our hands on our own personal copies of the original film and BYPASS the American remake in theatres (...and judging from what I have seen for myself and have heard from others about how much Verbinski's remake deviated from the original, it would seem that the studio exec's fears were clearly justified).  So, until now, the only way this title could have been acquired in the US was on VCD (which are about as fun as those old ''laserdiscs'') or pirated DVDs. So I have high hopes for this ''official'' American release DVD!
If no one has yet seen the DreamWorks remake, I would strongly suggest holding off on that idea UNTIL you have first experienced this movie in its original spectacle! Many people will say this movie is ''scary,'' but that's not really true; it is more ''creepy'' and ''sinister'' than anything else -- but it has ALL of the trappings of a truly good eerie and spooky movie: dark lighting, creepy sets, moody film score, subdued acting, an easy-pace, and suspenseful script.
If you have already been ''polluted'' with the Verbinski version, there's a good possibility you may not like this version, precisely for of the very reasons I have just mentioned. Not only does the DreamWorks/Verbinski project ''brighten'' things up to eliminate the dark & eerie look and feel of the original film, but it also tacks on a lot of extra stuff and details which (though perhaps present in the Japanese prequel and alternative sequels) were NOT present nor expressed in this Original film.&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if you have seen the DreamWorks fare and felt that somehow it could have been better or should have been handled differently, then THIS is the movie that is going to make you want to kick yourself for believing the hype and wasting nine bucks & time spent in line at the movie theatre -- and on top of that, the popcorn was stale.

1404263,5,B000058CB6,"To put it into words that everyone can understand, this is the only movie I have ever watched that caused a grown man to whimper like a young child with fear.  I will admit it is not a movie for your average, low attention span, American audience.  It takes someone of stronger mind with a deeper awareness to what is and is not done well to appreciate a movie of this caliber.  There are two main reasons.  For one, it is a foreign film, not viewable to most.  Reading and watching are too complicated to perform at the same time.  The lack of flamboyant Hollywood effects and expensive camera tricks, which have become a mainstay of the putrid [stuff] we are force-fed on a regular basis, is the second.  Not saying I do not like new and inventive techniques and visuals, but money does not make a movie.  This movie was made on a meager budget, to put it nicely. From the opening credits, it drips with atmosphere, surrounding you in an epiphany of fear.  Truthfully, it is the first movie I have seen since ""Candyman"", which I watched at the age of thirteen, that has caused me such a feeling of unease.  To wrap this up, anyone who wants to honestly enjoy a movie made to unsettle and possibly even disturb, yet at the same time keep a story, please do yourself the justice of watching this movie.

Don't be fooled by closed-minded 'americans' who need blood and gore and have to have everything explained or else they think the movie [is bad]. The American remake can't compare to its Japanese original. It doesn't need background music or slasher-movie-qualities to make it scary, it does it through the story. You have to watch and figure a lot of things out on your own (not have them told to you like in the remake).

1404265,5,B000058CB6,"anyways, as a mod of the Ringworld Forum, I thought I'd chime in, seeings how so many people tend to give bad reviews on these things.
this movie, unfortuneately, is given a bad rap by many for not being scarry or cheap looking.  well, it was pretty cheap, 6million to make (contrary to the 1mil figure someone else gave) however, this is quite high for a japanese film.  ok, the point is, this is a movie done in the classic (guess these kids don't know) style of CINEMA...  before the director of scream was even born, there was a guy named Alfred Hitchcock.  he made GOOD movies (without CG), they were also given the title ""horror""... long since, the term has shifted to mean ""things that go bump so you can cop a feel off your girlfriend""...

Since it is in Japanese, the subtitles were pretty off and if you're expecting it to be like the American version, you're wrong. The story is totally different, except for the deal with the cursed videotape. This time, the viewer has no idea where in the world the tape came from, but at least you have an idea of what the images represent. The main character the movie is focused on, Sadako, reminds me of the Japanese version of ""Carrie"", being abused by her peers for being ""different"".
There's actually 3 parts to 'Ringu': a prequel and sequel---you have to watch the prequel (Pt. 0) and sequel (Pt. 2) in order to understand more of 'Ringu'. I feel that the American version decided to merge all 3 parts of the Japanese version into one big American version.
Although it gave me a few shocks here and there, I wouldn't deem it as the scariest movie of all time. However, I give it credit for a pretty original story and it was more developed than the American version.",1043280000,,1124,4.541871921182266

I haven't seen the re-make yet, but now that I've seen the original, it's on my list.
'Ringu' is a low budget Japanese horror film that will please anyone in search of intense, yet intelligent, thrills.  It's a modern take on many elements of the classic ghost story; The characters encounter something odd, then investigate it, leisurely at first, then with greater desperation as they realize what they're up against.
'Ringu' deserves credit for creating real chills without ever once resorting to splatter or show-stopping special effects.  The supernatural is presented slowly and disturbingly, until it finally stares the characters (and the viewer) full in the face.  The climax has the feel of an actual nightmare.

7933051,5,B000058CB6,"As a longtime horror fan, I thought, by my mid 20s, nothing could ever really creep me out anymore.  Then I watched the American version of The Ring.  That ending.  Wow.  Plus when I got home I noticed I had exactly 1 unheard message on my voicemail O_O  Dude...  Needless to say, I hid until others came home, haha (and this was broad daylight).  So I'm glad to see not to many people hating on the remake here, since I always thought that was a bit snobbish and elitist.

Eventually it got me into Asian horror and it wasn't long before I checked out the original film - Ringu (and also read the novel by Koji Suzuki, basically became a Ring fanboy, and Japanese fanboy by extension, haha).  I won't say Ringu is the better film, both are stronger in some areas and less strong in others.  This one is VERY slow moving (which I wasn't used to, since I'd been raised on a steady diet of Hollywood movies, so I had to really train myself to appreciate these foreign flicks).  However, the ending, I'd venture to say, is even scarier than the remake's end.  Which is saying something, since like I said, I saw the remake first, so I KNEW WHAT WAS COMING.  And it still creeped me out even worse.  That upside down looking eye will haunt your dreams.  'Nuff said.

However, regardless of how people feel about the remake, Gore Verbinski really paved the way for ""J-Horror"" to become more mainstream in America (not just the remakes, but making tons of Asian horror titles more available in video stores, etc).  I know I probably wouldn't have known about it without The Ring.  And my life would be much poorer for that.  So yes, while some are zombie nuts (and that's fine, love The Walking Dead), I must really have a thing for lonely, long dark haired, vengeful, creepily moving ghost girls - we like what we like :)
