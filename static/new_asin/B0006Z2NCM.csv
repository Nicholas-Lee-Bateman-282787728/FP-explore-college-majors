2197273,5,B0006Z2NCM,"Love in the romantic sense could be described as an intense personal feeling with steps of warmth, devotion, tenderness, and attachment that could eventually lead to sexual embrace between two individuals with mutual and reciprocal feelings.  Despite this description there are many struggles with discovering this truly wonderful sensation and they may skip one or all of the steps and only adopt the sexual embrace.  Thus, the individual simply becomes an object for exchange of fluids and temporary lustful desire where the individual loses connection on a more cerebral plane leaving the person with a hollow and empty feeling after the sexual moment.  Rendez-vous displays this sexual emptiness where a young woman drifts from man to man, as she seeks a place to sleep for the night.

A realty agency receives a new client in Nina (Juliette Binoche) who is looking for a cheap, not too small, apartment in central Paris.  Currently, Nina stays with ""friends"", men that will let her stay for the night, frequently in exchange for her physical nearness and sexual embrace.  Often she tells the men that she loves them in order eliminate questions and awkward moments when she stays with them.  However, it seems as if she merely uses them for her personal needs.  Paulot (Wadeck Stanczak), the representative from the realty agency receives tickets to one of Nina's performances and he learns all this from her as she leaves her current ""friend"".

The innocent and kind Paulot finds Nina very attractive and his feelings begin to build up within him.  This presents an opportunity that Nina seizes while Paulot helplessly does everything to save her from homelessness.  Through Paulot's noble attempts Nina meets Quentin (Lambert Wilson), Paulot's roommate, who seems to be a shady character with much emotional baggage.  This becomes obvious, as Quentin follows Nina to her hotel room, which Paulot managed to arrange for her.

Initially, it seems as if the story is going in every possible direction without thought or consideration, as Quentin stalks Nina and convinces her to do what he says.  First Quentin appears to be a psychopath with stalking problems as he follows Nina wherever she wanders, which seems to frighten her.  When she finds someone to help protect her from him, she ends up protecting Quentin.  Quentin introduces Nina to the world of sex theater, and eventually sways her to let him spend the night.  This diverging wandering in the storyline initially seems impossible; however, patience will reward the viewers with big dividends.

Rendez-vous turns into a contemporary psychodynamic version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  Nina is the film's Juliet, a part she also prepares for in a play while she is struggling to grasp the concept of love during her preparations, as she learns the emptiness of mere sexual embrace and the importance of devotion and tenderness.  The director Andr Tchin presents the problems in the film through the results of characters actions, which displays immature blind obsession and hatred.  There is also a large portion of intolerance in the perspective of each character's feelings, as they all seem to put themselves first.  Rendez-vous offers loose adaptation of Shakespeare's teenage tragedy, which leaves the audience contemplating the notion of love, devotion, tenderness, affectionate warmth, and attachment as Nina plays her cards.",1113091200,20,3404,5.207339449541284
2197274,4,B0006Z2NCM,"The plot was a bit weak and not well developed.  The husband Eric seemed a bit of a good natured dimwit, especially the way he was played by the sneaky contractor Peter.  Peter was not only underhanded, but cold and critical of others.  His insults towards Simone's cooking were small and mean.  The young stud who lures her into a foolish but incredibly passionate and intense sexual fling hardly does more than look beautiful and smile.  I would like to have seen his character have a bit more seductive charm and allure to his personality - but maybe the director wanted it to be almost totally physical lust without a hint of real feeling between them.  However, that is what made the ending seem quite unreal.  The movie was made for me by two things - the incredible acting and natural beauty of Loes Haverkort, and the scenes of the French countryside, the village, and the photography of it.  I  had never seen Haverkort before, but fell in love with her (artistically speaking of course) during this movie.  Her strength, courage, passion, and sexual attractiveness made her character and that made the movie too interesting to stop watching.  I had been to France many, many times when I lived in the Netherlands, and I spent almost all of my visits in smaller cities and villages.  It is a very charming and beautiful  country in those locations, thus this movie had quite a hook for me.",1498003200,4,1398,4.6571428571428575
2197275,3,B0006Z2NCM,"There's a lot of tension in this failing marriage and the dream of starting over in a new country based on a sight-unseen relocation to a property bequeathed by a runaway mother. Sexual tension is almost comic relief in this tale of lies and manipulation. If I'd paid to see it, rather than having it as a Prime offering, I'd feel cheated.",1497916800,2,339,4.483870967741935

2197279,3,B0006Z2NCM,"As previous reviewers have stated, the film was produced in a lush natural setting; this was nice to experience. But things didn't add up. Peter's villainy was not fully explored. It seemed some of the Dutch people were aware of things he did in the past. Why would he use his son in a blackmail plot? And what as the motive? Plotting and scheming so he could build some bungalows? Did the son Michele, seduce Simone for that purpose? Is that why he confessed to the murder he didn't commit? He seemed like he wasn't that smitten with her that he would give up his life and liberty. The plot was pretty weak. And the subtitle delay posed problems.

P.S. It took a  Dutch production team to use French music in a film set in France. I find it so silly that these days the French use American pop music in excess in their films.",1495756800,4,826,4.32258064516129

2197281,3,B0006Z2NCM,"This 2015 Dutch film should not be confused with 2 other same-titled ones. The setting in the French countryside is divine: verdant hills, luxurious sunshine, open-air markets, an exquisite old regional home, ripe for renovation. The music is quite appealing, composed by Merlijn Snitker, feeling sort of contemporary French, mixed cleverly with some very sexy percussion. The story is not fully buyable, and not because such a horny-for-each-other pair might not easily come together, but because the writing doesn't provide any build-up to it.  There's really no antecedent or precipitant, just 2 folks talking about plumbing when his fingers suddenly graze her neck and trace her cleavage. Events don't seem to unfold; stuff happens and pivotal events seem inserted. The scenery and fresh music are winners;  Jeroen de Bruin's cinematography is excellent.",1495497600,12,858,5.492424242424242
2197282,4,B0006Z2NCM,"There is a problem with the sub-titles.  While the subtitles start off well synced with the voice of the speaker, they gradually begin appearing later and later than the dialog being spoken.  They end up with what seems about 4 - 5 SECONDS  of delay before they appear.  This causes problems in understanding what's going on, since the subtitles are then appearing over the speaking of a different character than the one who said the text of the subtitle.",1494720000,14,455,4.7215189873417724

2197284,3,B0006Z2NCM,"The lead actress does a very good job, and that is the best thing about this movie. The story is unsatisfying in too many ways.

2197358,5,B0006Z2NCM,"Rendez-vous is a beautiful, sexy, art-film. It won several prestigious
international awards and is critically acclaimed. Juliette Binoche is
completely uninhibited and gives a brave, fearless performance where
she bares herself completely...both emotionally and physically.

Thus, this film is not intended for the immature. Those with childish
minds who cannot handle looking at a beautiful woman's body (such as
feminists or other philistines) are advised to avoid this. Another
reviewer called it ""pointless drivel"" and complained about the
""gratuitous nudity"". If seeing a woman's vagina is too much for the
immature mind of that viewer to handle, then their kind should avoid
high-art cinema such as this. Their kind would be better served watching
crude, low-brow gay-porn garbage, loosely disguised as ""comedy"", such as ""Bruno"". That type of film is more suited for those misandric simpletons who prefer looking at male genitalia. Those who appreciate complex,beautiful art and appreciate the female form will enjoy this.

Nina (Juliette Binoche) moves to Paris and she becomes the love
interest of three very different men and has tumultuous concurrent
relationships with each. Multiple plot and character lines develop from
this. This movie will challenge you and you'll find yourself pondering
some of the scenes days later. Highly recommended.",1247616000,3,1354,5.6
2197359,3,B0006Z2NCM,"Kind of silly nonsense about an actress who is stalked by an actor whose girlfriend committed suicide. He dies and Juliette Binoche thinks shes will, too. It's muddled up with ""Romeo and Juliet."" Lots of nudity. Worth a watch.",1220745600,,226,4.82051282051282
2197360,4,B0006Z2NCM,"This is a movie to challenge our intellects as well as emotions.

The main protagainist is admirably played by Juliet Binoche who bares all, body and soul, in this French film.

It takes place following a rail journey which may be a metaphor for a journey through life or an assumption about someone's career choice. It emerges that Binoche's character is free spirited but who has an impact on everyone she comes into contact with.

As the plot unfolds with a dynanism which is hard to follow, the viewer is challenged to understand the levels of meaning and relationship which are thrown at you by the film. In seeking to understand what is going on the question one must ask is one of how we think and how we feel.

In some ways this is a very cerebral film, something Binoche retuns to in the exquisite Cache, yet in other ways this is a raw emotional film where passions run high and feelings are crucial.

Not something one can just see and move on to but a very worthwhile piece of art.",1204761600,2,993,4.434065934065934
2197361,4,B0006Z2NCM,"Andr Tchin made this 1985 film RENDEZ-VOUS before his promising career was established, giving us such fine films as My Favorite Season, The Innocents, The Wild Reeds, Beach Caf, Alice and Martin, etc.  The sensitivity to character development is tightly wound in this work but some of the finesse that followed his later works is missing.  In the end we are left wondering a bit about what happened to almost everyone.

Nina (Juliette Binoche in her first film role) has traveled to Paris from her small home in Toulouse to try her hand at acting and to live the wild life that has been unavailable to her in Toulouse.  She beds nearly every man she encounters and acts bit parts in small theaters, barely eking out an existence.  Tired of one night stands and sharing quarters with others, she sets out to find her own apartment, stopping in to a realtors office where she encounters Paulot (Wadeck Stanczak) who is immediately smitten with her sensual good looks and manner.  Having no place to stay Nina agrees to spend a few days with Paulot in a flat shared with the hauntingly strange Quentin (Lambert Wilson).  Nina is oddly attracted to Quentin and is somewhat put off by the fact that Quentin is an actor in a sex theater.  We discover Quentin narrowly escaped death some time back when the actress playing Juliet to his Romeo was killed.  Nina has an approach/avoidance conflict with Quentin, all the while fending off offers by the pathetic Paulot to care for her. Quentin is killed in a car accident, Nina meets the elderly director Scrutzler (Jean-Louis Trintignant in a splendid cameo role) who promises her the role of Juliet in his casting of the Shakespeare drama, and her career as an actress seems to be launched.  Full of self doubt and fear stimulated by the ghost-like appearances of the dead Quentin, Nina prepares for the role, copes with Paulot's advances, shares a flat with him, and is finally left in the stage wings with her focus on becoming an actress challenged with her needs for physical and stable love.  And we are left there.

Juliette Binoche is very fine in this her 'maiden voyage' and it is a happy finding that she is far more beautiful (as well as a far better actress) in her current more mature state.  Lambert Wilson gives a fine performance, finding the line between lurid sexuality and lonely afterlife ghost a position he easily treads.  The film definitely has moments but it is only a hint (and a strong one) of just what to expect from the gifted Andr Tchin.  Not bad for a twenty year old film!  Grady Harp, November 06",1162425600,2,2573,4.65929203539823
2197362,2,B0006Z2NCM,"I always wince a bit when Americans (and, really, most other nationalities) are all too confident when they poke fun at the French.  But sometimes the French play into the hands of such a characiture.  If one were in search of evidence that French films are obscure, despairing, and full of gratuitous sex dressed up as high art, Rendez-Vous should be exhibit A.  It is almost a parody of a crappy, pretentious, and completely joyless arthouse film.

Having escaped to Paris in order to ""live life,"" Nina does quite the opposite.  The dingy depiction of the Paris underscores the impression that the city is more of a meat grinder than a place of discovery or liberation.  Early on in the film, we interupt Nina at the theater while as she is about to mount the usher.  He proceeds to treat her terribly, he insults her, and a pattern is born.  Nina will continue to attract and be drawn to men who abuse her.  Yet she is not simply a passive victim in this game.  Paulot, who arranged her lodging, seems at first to have the normal attraction to Nina.  Surely, this attraction is sexual, but it is not exclusively sexual.  We can easily imagine Paulot, if he had never been humiliated by her, desiring a normal relationship.  But as Nina later admits to her theater director, she would not sleep with Paulot.  He is sweet, and she tells Paulot that she loves him, but that is not enough.  She is drawn to something more sinister.  Paulot's behavior at the end of the film is disgusting and degrading, but I didn't feel that this was inherent to his character.  Nina has left her mark, Paulot becomes what he must be to have her.  Nina is not ""living life"" in Paris, she is emotionally dead, and is making the same of others.

Surrounding her relationships is a storyline concerning a production of Romeo and Juiliet, its director, and a tragedy involving its previous stars.  How this pertains to Nina is unclear, but the idea that ""the sins (or tragedies rather) of the father will be visited on the son"" comes to mind.

This film is not erotic, and Nina is not sexy.  We see no evidence of her desires and there is not one loving or tender second in this movie.  She runs head long into misery and sometimes can return it in kind.  Ulitmately, she is a little girl who is destroyed by Paris.  So what does the film want to portray?  Utter despair and humiliation?  How French!

I gave the movie 2 stars because I wasn't compelled to turn it off.  While I didn't like the movie, and won't recommend it, I was still kept reasonably interested, and do like watching Juiliette Binoche.  I hung on for some kind of redemtion, but it never came.  I guess that would be too sentimental, or bourgeios. It's a shame, because I do like many French movies, and movies that do something unusual.",1154908800,11,2786,4.512
2197363,3,B0006Z2NCM,"Binoche as the sexual adventuress Nina, fresh to Paris from a small town in the provinces, does a terrific job of acting in this film, which is why I gave it three stars.  The rest of the cast do their best to make something of this nonsensical film, but without Binoche it would merit only one star.

The plot is a rather unimaginative and shallow love-triangle, or perhaps quadrangle (it's not clear that Scrutzler [Jean-Louis Trintignant] is NOT sexually interested in her), with supernatural and pornographic overtones.  Nina is clearly terrified of love, as are the other characters, and uses sex as a drug and as currency.  The males Paulot and Quentin are attracted to her like flies to honey, but are frustrated and angered by her capriciousness.  Nudity, pseudo-sex, and graphic violence are not exactly gratuitious, but they do not add weight to the plot, merely make the banality more offensive.  Techine attempts to bring some intellectual depth to the piece by making Nina an aspiring actress in Scrutzler's new production of ""Romeo and Juliet"", but only succeeds in seeming pretentious and silly.  The movie ends on a note of fashionably bizarre Euro-nihilism: Quentin is dead, but appears to Nina as a ghost; Paulot has requited his love for Nina in a nauseating ""love"" scene, and is disgusted by her; and Scrutzler disappears into the night just as Nina is set to appear on stage in her first big role as ""Juliet"".  We last see Nina in tears, desperate, at the end of her rope, as her big chance dissolves in front of her eyes.

No wonder it got a prize at Cannes!

Paris is presented to us as deliberately dingy, I suppose in an attempt to be ""artistic"".  The soundtrack is sugary, pretentious, and a little bizarre in the ugly context.  The subtitles are intrusive, and not always faithful to the original French.  The sex scenes are deliberately degrading and not at all erotic, in spite of Binoche's attractive young body.  Brian McFarlane's adulatory ""essay"" in the accompanying program guide just compounds the offense.

It is often said that the French confuse sex with love.  The films of Rohmer, Truffaut, Renoir, and others bely that canard, but Trechine seems intent on proving it.  He did a decent job of presenting believable and interesting characters in ""Ma Saison Preferee"", but he fails miserably in ""Rendez-vous"".  This is an ugly film.

If you like Binoche and are interested in her development as an actress, you may find some value in this film.  It is otherwise very missable.",1134259200,15,2514,4.843091334894614
2197364,2,B0006Z2NCM,"Juliette Binoche is, as one might expect, excellent. Her character has none of the strength of her later roles in Bleu or Chocolat, but that wasn't her fault - she played the character well.

However, she's the only worthwhile thing in the movie. There are no sympathetic characters (not even Binoche's, really). The random guy who picks up Nina in a bar harasses her less than anyone else in the movie. There's no motivation for much of anything (apart from animal lust on Paulot's part, one supposes). This film certainly isn't extraordinary, and there are none of the ordinary endearing elements in it (realistic drama, romance, character growth, sex scenes that aren't tantamount to rape or involve spitting in someone's face, relationships that make sense, etc.).

The Amazon review claims ""it seems to make sense as it hurtles along."" No, in fact it doesn't. T&eacute;chin&eacute; tries to address this at one point, when during a discussion of Romeo and Juliet the director character claims we need to ignore _why_ they fell in love. But at least in R&J there's some sort of romantic logic, while in this movie there's none whatsoever.

A real let-down. I love Binoche, and other T&eacute;chin&eacute; movies are certainly worthwhile (Ma Saison Pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;e and Les &Eacute;gar&eacute;s are good). This is only for Binoche fans, and I would recommend renting instead of buying.",1131840000,6,1401,5.1902654867256635
2197365,2,B0006Z2NCM,I was disappointed that I had to read words deciphered from a foreign language. The words were not on the screen long enough to read and still see the film. The plot was very poor. The ending left me wondering if there were more to come.,1127952000,4,237,4.173913043478261

8043928,3,B0006Z2NCM,"The actress was definitely good, but the story itself made me angry lol All I can say is...consequences. Makes me wonder why women can be so stupid as to fall for a handsome young man, and worse, she makes it so obvious because she keeps staring at him. Also, I figured out the plot and 'twist' halfway between the movie (they left plenty of hints to figure it out), so no surprise about the ending. I'm just glad there was some form of justice.",1511308800,,445,4.309523809523809
