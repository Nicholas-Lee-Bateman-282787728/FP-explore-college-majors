The biomechanics section was interesting: they are everyday functions but you would never have thought about using them in application. If you're interseted in psychological combat and spetsnaz training, check it out.",1306368000,,423,5.424242424242424
8095461,1,B000C2XV6G,"Absolutely the most ridiculous martial arts ""instructional"" video I have ever watched. The entire video is of the instructor literally breathing on his students, who then fall to the ground. The instructor is supposedly a Russian Spetznaz colonel and Systema master, yet he is significantly obese. This video is a comedy, not a martial arts instructional DVD.",1285545600,,359,5.315789473684211
8095462,5,B000C2XV6G,"I agree with reviewer ""matt"" almost word for word so mostly I will focus on things he didn't say or said with difference emphasis.

Perhaps I might disagree very slightly on the tape being misnamed, as this is truly beyond the physical, but is rather psychological, visual, and attacks o defends using pressure points, visual disturbance, non-verbal hypnosis and kinesiology principles.

The instructor (through the excellent interpreter who REALLY knows her job and likely works with this Mikhail regularly) makes clear that nothing magical or supernatural is happening here but that he is very explicitly using body mechanics and psychology to work the magic.

In a few places the students seem to throw themselves too easily, but this is really just similar to jiu-jitsu or aikido players who throw themselves to avoid a bad, awkward, or joint breaking maneuver -- amateurs will be thrown too, but falling badly hurts, while rolling through a good fall makes it easy to get back up immediately.

Mikhail demonstrates enough defenses against ""hard attacks"" to convince me that he is doing these tricks for real.

If you have every engaged in ""ki tickling"", then you might best understand this method as ""combat ki tickling"".  It seems to be rooted in a combination of aiki and break states from NLP/hypnosis -- as well as more that I am still trying to internalize fully.

E.g., I suspect that he is intercepting the coordination between visual and inner ear queues that support the critical balance needed for bipedal motion -- as well as disturbing the kinesthetic/proprioceptive feedback from the body when he taps, presses, strokes or otherwise engages a pressure point.

He is also clear in pointing out that if anything doesn't work against a determined opponent, then all of his methods can be assisted with strikes  -- this would be similar to the invisible (missing to most newbies) atemi or pressure point strikes in most Aikido practice -- they are there but you don't need them or the extra damage during practice.

Negatives:

1) I wish he had been a little more explicit about ""how to know"" which movement will work, strategy and tactics sorts of information.  Maybe no one asked. (It's a live seminar.)  This is similar to the problem of ""How do you know you are doing Tai Chi or Aikido correctly?"")

2) How well will it work on a drunk or a PCP dusted moron intent on mayhem?  (I suspect just fine for Mikhail.)

To repeat the warning given by matt though:  Probably not a the best FIRST tape on Systema (Russian MA) or on martial arts in general.",1216944000,5,2565,4.8463302752293576
8095463,5,B000C2XV6G,"I wish they'd change the title to something less esoteric. Not quite sure I agree with the product description's sensationalist tone, but it is ceratinly a true example of the refined use of psychology on an oppponent by a master martial artist who deserves much broader recognition.

This is NOT a tape to get if you are looking into Systema or Russian Martial Arts for the first time or if you have little martial arts experience. It is too wierd for that purpose. Why do I think that?  Well, unless you have experienced this sort of stuff you will watch it in disbeleif. Please understand, it isn't black magic or acting that is shown, but it isn't something that you can learn from the dvd and do any time soon. Ryabko is in my opinion one of the greatest known living martial artists (so many live in obscurity who may be better, but that's life), and this is an example of the outcome of his life and personhood. I've experienced enough of this in my own life to know how effective it can be, but this dvd is not for the curious or amatures. Start with other Systema dvds, like Hand to Hand.",1156550400,6,1097,4.399014778325123
