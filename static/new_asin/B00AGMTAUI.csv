8551508,3,B00AGMTAUI,"AS a previous reviewer said ""it should be made clear that this is not a performance"". Interesting enough but still not a performance. None of his church operas are on proper dvd. Prodigal son, Curlew River or Burning fiery Furnace. What is up with the music industry that no-one is prepared to record these. They are fabulous pieces (I saw them first in St Paul's cathedral London, 50 years ago and they made a huge impression). Come on chaps, someone must want to cash it on a market out there panting for a recording or two. Neither is Noye's Fludde massed choirs of Welsh school children with a few stars of the Welsh National opera 1990. Again fabulous, where's the dvd? Did we only reach market projection of 999,999 instead of 1 million?",1427328000,,743,4.593984962406015
8551509,4,B00AGMTAUI,"Very interesting documentary of the audio recording of Britten's opera ""Burning Fiery Furnace"" in black and white as would be expected for its era.  It shows Britten at work and the methods for achieving the stereo effects that were desired.  I should be made clear that the complete opera is not found here, but may be available elsewhere.",1386460800,,340,4.844827586206897
