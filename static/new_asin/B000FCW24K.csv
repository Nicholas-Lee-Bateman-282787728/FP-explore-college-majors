8120853,4,B000FCW24K,"3.5 stars (add the extra half star for lovers of classics). This is a definite film to put on your list, especially to see an early Merle Oberon (lovely as ever). A typical 1930s melodramatic plot, with British rather than American treatment: struggling young composer falls under the charms of a famous opera singer. He goes off with and marries her, leaving behind the girl who secretly loves him (Oberon). Wife two-times husband, husband kills lover and is sentenced to Devil's Island... well, you can fill in the rest (not really giving away anything in the previous summary, since the structure of the film lets the viewer know right away what is going on and pretty much what has happened). Nicely underplayed for the times, especially in view of what Hollywood might have done with it. Give it a try.",1342569600,,807,4.771428571428571
8120854,5,B000FCW24K,Excellent British musical drama from 1934.  Roan apparantly used a full-length British print of the film which looks quite good.  We are quite fortunate they did not use the butchered American version.,1273276800,3,201,5.25
