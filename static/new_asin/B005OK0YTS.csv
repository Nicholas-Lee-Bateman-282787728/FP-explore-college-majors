8481406,5,B005OK0YTS,I bought both sets of this anime and I just love these I found them on Hulu but they were only in Japanese beautiful artwork love this!,1525910400,,135,4.037037037037037
8481407,2,B005OK0YTS,"I really feel this anime relies a lot on comedy and stereotypical anime gags, characters overreacting and changing of art style to sell comedy.

 Unfortunately I seen a lot of really great AMVs For this anime on YouTube and for the longest time I wanted to see it. But as a product, it has crappy computer animation, its another one of those Japanese anime about a male character in high school with a lot of females around them him and he is closeted from the outside world,  and has that serving a female character and a wimpy male character type stereotype.

 For the early 2000s, It really is not excusable in its generic animation and art style. I do like the saturated colors and the Gothic look, But nothing special.

 Watch some episodes on YouTube before buying it. Its not worth the $20 that I paid for.

I do hate being negative. But sometimes you cannot avoid it when something is this very terrible.",1523059200,,912,4.5182926829268295

8481413,4,B005OK0YTS,"Only watch if you have seen the other ""Rozen Maiden"" seasons. This OVA focuses heavily on Suigentou, before she became Shinku's enemy.",1383004800,2,134,5.136363636363637
8481414,4,B005OK0YTS,"Loved the series, would like to have said I loved this but the story had a couple if issues.  Whether this is a story in the print series or was created for these anime it looks like it was created after the original series.  However, I am not unhappy with my purchase.  Spoilers follow,  The issues I had with this anime:

1.) It shows Barasuishou as doll created at the same time as the Rozen Maidens.  I don't think that is the case since she was not created by Father.  That also means that there is still a seventh doll we have still not seen in the animes.

2) It never does explain how Suigintou got her rosa mysitica or how she got ""completed"" and into a case.

3) Major story line problem: Shinku finds out that Suigintou is a ""broken doll"".

Point one can be overlooked since it does not affect this story.  It just does not fit in with the series.  Point two is important since the two shows do not explain why Father would make a broken doll.  I can think of a explanation, that Suigintou ""completed"" herself but that does not make a lot of sense.  Another possibility is that Father's apprentice ""completed"" Suigintou, which I could believe.  From my point of view, Shinku did not know that Suigintou was a ""broken doll"" at the end of the first anime season. And if Shinku did know during Ouverture, she could have argued that it would be pointless for Suigintou to keep fighting since she could not become Alice.",1370649600,,1426,4.3893129770992365
