1082511,5,630581726X,"I own all of Shirley's movies her best and her worst- if you are looking into buying a Shirley collection than this is the one to buy! Although, I'll say I'm disappointed that it dosn't include ""Poor Little Rich Girl"" or Shirley's most classic-""Bright Eyes""(On the good ship lollipop). But, this has some of Shirley at her best.

Heidi- although an film made when Shirley was older. It shows off Shirley's acting talent as Heidi especially in the scene with her grandfather. It is the best film that Shirley made after the baby-doll era. And you'll be close to tears in the scene when Heidi is threatened to be taken away from her grandfather. You'll also love Heidi's grandfather who does a wonderful job in his role- I wish he was my gramps.

Baby Take A Bow- Is simply wonderful  in this film where she showcases some of her cutest dance moves and her on screen chemistry with her dad- James Dunn my favorite of her on screen dads. You'll fall in love with Shirley as this little baby doll.

Curly Top- Shirley is so cute in this film as an orphan it features her classic ""Animal Crackers In My Soup"" Also chemistry with her other on-screen dad. Also features alot of Shirley's musical talents.

All in all this is a good Shirley collection to start with-- if you have little girls or grand- daughters this  a collection they will love- sit back and enjoy some good clean fun with them.",1106697600,17,1389,4.51394422310757
1082512,4,630581726X,"This is a wonderful product! I recieved it as a birthday present from my parents and I loved it! It contains ""Baby Take a Bow""-about a little girl who finds a stolen string of pearls and keeps them in her home for a nosy detective to find. Her father is accused of the crime. ""Curly Top"" is about a lonely man who adopts an adorable little youngster along with her grown-up sister, whom he falls in love with. ""Heidi""...well you all know Heidi! The little orphan girl living with her grandfather who struggles to live a private life without people trying to take her away from him. All three films have been fully restored in colour with excellent sound quality...they almost match the standards of films from the early nineties. They all feature the darling Shirley Temple and come in a pretty red and gold box with cute pictures on it...totally worth it!!",1027814400,16,857,4.607843137254902

It did appear that some of the original sections were either lost or no longer usable,and the sound is pretty atrocious - but even still it seems miraculous that this little film is still around and viewable at all.  It was an awesome sight to see a small clip of Hollywood's history still clinging to life.  The child actors were all really cute in delivering their lines I must say, including what must've been an about 3-year-old Shirley Temple.

1082729,3,630581726X,Shirley Temple was always a precious baby!  She is too cute. Although quiet old movie it is a short story with cute antics and funny bylines.

1082731,2,630581726X,"While this short video shows how good Shirley Temple was going to be, I didn't like how the children where doing adult things.

1082769,3,630581726X,"This short film is debatable. Yes the toddlers here do adult things straight out or hints of it. I don't like the part where the kids are doing kissing, dancing sexy and all that, but they were pretty good at acting. Some I think cried for real when stuff happened to them, I also felt that some wanted to act and some were just forced to. You can tell in their eyes and body language. But its only 10 minutes of this and I heard it was three days of shooting. Shirley Temple's parents are said to be very proud of her in this film! So Its either a love hate kinda movie. Watch at your own risk I say.",1369267200,4,601,4.016666666666667

1082771,5,630581726X,"This short film is a part of a series of short films called Baby Berlesques done in 1933.  They were the first film/movie Shirley Temple was in.  I believe she was 3 at the time.  These shorts are take offs on some then famous movie scenes and adult situations.

When watching this you need to remember where the US was culturely.  This was before civil rights movements and in 1933 the movies had just within the last few years became available with dialouge.  And black people didn't get many parts.  Often times  white people were painted to look like minority groups.  Not the case here.  The diapers and giant safety pins are meant to further parady and drive home the idea that these are kids doing adult things.

I saw no issues with any of it.  The kids were great at remembering their lines.  This series of a few different scenarios was apparently shot in only 3 days!  And you can see even at 3 what a speacil talent and how captivating Shirley Temple was!!!  A lot of those young children were in others of her movies as well.",1365724800,2,1038,4.417989417989418

Hugging one soldier while full frontal long kiss on the mouth with another soldier behind his back by Shirley. Not cute!!
And at the end where one ""soldier"" is picking his teeth with Shirley's diaper pin? Not cute!!!

She already had the Little Princess and had seen Heidi on television.  The problem with reading classic literature like Swiss Family Robinson and Heidi is that the language is often archaic for the Twilight set.

If you are buying used videos that have been re-shrink-wrapped, but sure the vendor has rewound the VHS.  It is embarrassing to have something look brand new only to discover that it wasn't rewound. Just advice to sellers.

""Curly Top,"" too, is the ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"" movie which I had totally forgotten but which my daughter knew some of the words. Remember: Shirley Temple was one of the few child stars that didn't end up with major issues and went on th be ambassador to Ghana.",1294444800,,814,4.631944444444445

The ""14 Features"" claim on this product's cover is incorrect. The set consists of 3 features and 11 shorts. There's no literature included in the sturdy snapcase plastic box. Program contents are listed on its back cover.

Here, a potentially interesting collection is badly hampered by a great deal of flawed source material.

DISC ONE--
Audio on THE LITTLE PRINCESS is top shelf, but colors are washed out. A small border appears around the image, thus the entire picture is visible
LAW OF VENGEANCE starts at low volume, but that improves within a minute. Film stock used is quite degraded with many break splices. Evidence here of a dub from VHS
In RED-HAIRED ALIBI, Shirley is last-billed. Lots of film breaks here, but sound is clearer

DISC TWO--
Seven of these eleven shorts run under 10 minutes
#1 DORA'S DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS - Multi-generational blurry dub with muffled sound that's slightly out of sync
#2 GLAD RAGS TO RICHES - Re-release with new title card and flown-in intro music
#3 KID 'N' AFRICA - Another murky dub in every respect
#4 KID 'N' HOLLYWOOD - Sounds OK but looks awful-- blurry, unsharp, edits
#5 MANAGED MONEY - The same as #4
#6 MERRILY YOURS - Far better condition here-- the best of the disc
#7 PARDON MY PUPS - Back to blurry, multi-generational dub
#8 THE PIE COVERED WAGON - Original titles. Too much contrast here
#9 POLLY TIX IN WASHINGTON - OK sound, poor video. Really blurry!
#10 WAR BABIES- Dark and unsharp image with muffled sound
#11 BIGGEST LIL STAR OF THE '30S - Newsreel snippets look decent but are heavily filtered",1250467200,83,1857,5.183333333333334

A variety of silliness transpires during this short, much of it concerning Mary Lou's new-found desert tramp friend (Huntley Gordon) who is a victim of amnesia, but the ofttimes spontaneous roughhousing between the two teen-aged boys along with their complete artlessness causes the viewer to forget the thinly written script.",1175472000,,697,5.232142857142857
