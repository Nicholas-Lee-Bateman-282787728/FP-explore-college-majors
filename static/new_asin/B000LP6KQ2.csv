8162810,4,B000LP6KQ2,"Not my most favorite, but good enough to keep. The step portion is quite complex, good for those who don't really want to get it on the first try to keep it interesting. I wish the intensity was higher, so I'm finding myself adding jumps or jogs in place of knees and marches. The weight section is compound and depending on the weight used, pretty challenging. In-between is a med-ball section as cool-down after the step, or warmup before the weights, but I found this much more intense than that and is actually my most favorite part. One thing completely missing is a stretch at the end which makes it somewhat incomplete.",1233532800,,626,4.598214285714286
