5553185,3,B00B2MKSQ6,"This movie had a great underlying story, although it wandered unnecessarily all over the place and was poorly executed. Music was terrible, Schuetter's makeup and acting was just plain BAD! Unger was terrible - although maybe she was wooden because her plastic surgery mad her face unable to move.  Rest of acting was fine.

I thought the boy murdered his mother for the sexual abuse he suffered - there was one tiny flashback of the padlock in his 8-year-old hands - and that was why he stayed hidden in the forest - not because he was (understandably) afraid of his alcoholic father - but because he had murdered his mother. If his father had - why wouldn't he have been in jail?",1390003200,,681,4.573770491803279
5553186,1,B00B2MKSQ6,"When I see the rave reviews of this movie on this site, IMDB and Netflix I have to wonder if this might be friends and family of the director/writer/star/producer (yeah, all the same guy) stacking the deck. Let's see, what's wrong: preposterous story about this magical, sensitive, saintly, typewriter-hugging wild man of the woods, a former abused runaway, who heals everyone with whom he comes in touch; laughable makeup featuring what looks like a dime-store fake beard; irritating, overblown, repetitive music; bad acting by the main character; laughable portrayal of a mental institution and an overall feeling one is watching a bad romance novel brought to life. If these great reviews are really sincere I want some of what these people are smoking. No wait, on second thought, I don't.",1382659200,4,793,5.107692307692307
5553187,5,B00B2MKSQ6,"This film is definitely not for everyone. I truly enjoyed it due to its non linear way of unraveling the story. Its a dark film and will raise certain emotions from different viewers. Cast was great lots of recognizable faces. Well worth watching! If you enjoy stories that are dark but has meaning, watch Samuel bleak",1377734400,2,318,4.696428571428571
5553188,1,B00B2MKSQ6,"Hated this film! Got the impression that the writer was trying to justify Samuels father killing his wife because she sexually assaulted Samuel and he was only trying to protect him. The fact that he was a belligerent abusive drunk who forgets his birthday and shoots a dog he loves says little to prove this concern for his son.  What also comes to mind is that many abusive alcoholics imagine such things going on, although there is the scene where it appears Samuel remembers the abuse from his mother and therefore forgives his father.  Well, forgives him then kills his father in the same manner as his father killed his wife, albeit at the fathers initiative.
In the midst of all this to add some interest or maybe because sex sells the Doctor finds her police officer husband in a compromising position.  Still wondering what relevance that or even the death of the Doctors mother had to do with anything. Total waste of an hour and  thirty four minutes.",1376956800,6,961,4.668639053254438
5553189,5,B00B2MKSQ6,Loved this movie from start to finish! Pretty intense with a great story line. I would recommend this for a good thrill!,1376265600,3,120,4.5
5553190,2,B00B2MKSQ6,"I just didn't like this movie at all. It was slow moving, and just didn't grab my attention. I thought the acting was pretty poor, and wooden, with no characters really being developed. Also during the movie, the same instrumental kept playing during scenes which was pretty off putting.
Some people will like the movie, just not for me.",1373760000,,337,4.728813559322034
5553191,4,B00B2MKSQ6,"A very sensitively written, directed, acted & photographed movie about mentally disturbed people with a story tha goes sort of weird & a surprise ending. Definitely not for all tastes.",1373760000,3,184,5.166666666666667
5553192,5,B00B2MKSQ6,"This is the first film in awhile that caught me FLAT FOOTED when the TRUTH came out. The ending had to be what it was but I wanted to know what happened to the three lead characters. They each had their own story and I wanted to know if they found happiness. Watch it, buy it, or at least rent it. The tears and humor is short but the feelings are deep.",1373328000,4,353,3.9166666666666665

8561525,3,B00B2MKSQ6,A great movie for psychological reasons....clearly shows that nothing is cut and dry....the musical score just adds to the pain that Samuel has dealt with. Not Oscar material according to academy standards but worth watching. And I'm not family of anyone in the movie.,1476576000,,268,5.113636363636363

8561529,1,B00B2MKSQ6,Not a good movie. I kept watching hoping it would get better but never did. Main actor had very fake looking hair and beard. That was the highlight of the movie for me because it gave me a chuckle. Disappointing.,1428105600,,212,4.325

8561531,3,B00B2MKSQ6,"[Spoilers all over the place!] Wow, where to begin?  An elderly lady, whose son-in-law thinks she may be going senile, clearly sees a strange man in their backyard, in the daylight, and tells her daughter.  Of course, no one believes her, at first, but her son-in-law investigates and finds a young man, long thought dead and now mute, living in a shack way back in the woods!  Oh, did I mention the son-in-law is Chief of Police and that his wife is a doctor and director of the local mental institution?  How convenient! ;)  Even with that somewhat implausible beginning, I have to admit, I was surprisingly engrossed and following right along, clueless as to what I was in for.  Apparently the young man in the woods, ""Samuel,"" had been hiding out for over 15 years after his Dad killed his Mother, but the question is why?  Nevermind that Samuel used the same toothbrush all those years, it seems (on the plus side, though, he missed all those bad reality-TV shows, LOL), and sometimes lived on dog food from a neighbor, even when the neighbor knew that Samuel was doing so and knew who he was and what he underwent as a child (why didn't he put out better/human food, then?). Unfortunately, the viewer is made to wait the entire movie to find out Samuel's Dad's motive, and when it's finally revealed, it's, at best, awkward, neither here nor there, and not exactly a heartwarming ending.  In the process of getting there, however, Samuel is taken to jail, has a small stroke, gets taken to the hospital, and then is picked up by his Dad (in a decidedly lukewarm reunion, to say the least) and taken back home, at which point he escapes, barefoot, to...the aforementioned mental institution!  While there, a female patient tries to seduce Samuel, and an institution aide sleeps with the Chief of Police, which is discovered by his wife on the same day that his wife's mother/his mother-in-law (the elderly lady) dies, but the aide still keeps her job, even though she slept with her boss's husband!  Seemingly 5 minutes later, the wife forgives him, then sleeps with him, too! What does this say about men and their relationships?  What does this say about women and their relationships?  More importantly, how was their relationship even integral to the plot?  Finally, Samuel forgives his Dad, after his Dad explains that his motive was to protect Samuel.  Then, Samuel apparently feels it's for the best to, in turn, burn his Dad alive!  Samuel either does little or no time for this crime, and--get this--ends up living back in the shack in the woods!! Home Sweet Home! ;) This entire time, by the way, although Samuel shaves, he never gets a haircut or says one word, until only a few seconds are left in the film!  Even with those creaks in the script, warts and all, and low budget, the film is still oddly thought-provoking, original, and worth a look (though certainly not with your whole family in the room), thanks to its beautiful soundtrack and eccentrically fine performances. [FYI: It's more economical to get this in a movie pack, not separately.]",1422662400,,3068,4.727954971857411
8561532,3,B00B2MKSQ6,"There were so many things about this film I didn't like.  But it held my interest enough to find out what happened.  Unlike others, I wasn't surprised.  If you saw the clues beforehand, you knew what was up.",1408838400,,207,4.394736842105263
8561533,4,B00B2MKSQ6,"I got this movie as part of one of those DVD collections of 15 horror movies that you can pick up at the grocery store for five bucks, so I was quite surprised to find that this is actually quite an excellent movie. I'm not sure why it was included in a horror movie bundle pack, as it is in no way a horror flick, but more of a drama instead, or perhaps a bit of a psychological thriller. The acting is excellent, and the story is very engaging, although I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Definitely worth a watch.",1397088000,2,521,4.117647058823529
8561534,5,B00B2MKSQ6,"Wow I was not expecting that. A movie that actually shocked me. Great movie with a great cast, and I loved seeing David Zayas from Dexter.",1395014400,,138,4.346153846153846
