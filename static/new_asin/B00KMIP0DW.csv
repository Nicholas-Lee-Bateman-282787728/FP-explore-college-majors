8660025,5,B00KMIP0DW,"Anyone who is a fan of Nordic crime/mystery shows should really check out Varg Veum.  Trond Espen Seim is really great as the private detective.
The DVD set contains all twelve feature length Varm Veum movies(some of which had a theatrical release, and some of which were straight to DVD).  The DVDs are Region 2 and in PAL format, so standard American DVD players(including gaming systems like the PS3,PS4,etc) won't play them unless they're both format free(can play either PAL or NTSC) or region free(can play Region 1,2,etc).

If you do have a player like that, you're in for a treat!  :)
These may be official Norwegian releases, BUT they do have English subtitles! Grammatically correct & non-stilted subs! You can even set the main menu language to English.  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1440374400,6,782,4.984615384615385
