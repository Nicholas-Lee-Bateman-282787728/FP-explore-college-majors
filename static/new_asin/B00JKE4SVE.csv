6366080,5,B00JKE4SVE,A Million Ways to Die in the West is a very funny movie. When I saw it in theaters I literally had tears in my eyes from laughing! If you're a fan of Ted you'll love this comedy!,1401494400,5,178,3.710526315789474
6366081,4,B00JKE4SVE,"In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" Seth MacFarlane (who also directed and produced the movie), stars as Albert, a milquetoast sheep farmer in 1882 who gets dumped by the town beauty (Amanda Seyfried) for a foppish guy who runs the town ""mustachery"" (Neil Patrick Harris).  Albert isn't very good at sheep farming, still lives with his grim perpetually rocking chair bound parents, and hasn't murdered anyone, which is unusual in that time and place.  His friend, Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) is equally passive, and his main problem is that he can't get his fianc&eacute;e (Sarah Silverman) to have premarital sex, as she's a devout Christian who believes in saving herself for marriage - though she has  a day job in a whorehouse.  Still, Albert is determined to win his former girlfriend back and winds up challenging her new boyfriend to a shooting duel.  When a mysterious beauty (Charlize Theron) rides into town and befriends Albert, he's surprised but quickly falls for her, as she starts coaching him.  Trouble is that she's married to the meanest sharpshooter in the West, only in one of those classic Hollywood rom-com moves, forgets to inform Albert of this, until it's too late.  With two guys out for blood, plus threats from all the other ways to accidentally die in the West, can he finally win the girl of his dreams, even if she's not originally what he expects?

The plot is predictable, but the audience I saw it with (mostly over 55) pretty much all loved it and chuckled/giggled/howled throughout.  (One woman was in tears during the scene where an unlikeable character experiences prolonged gastro-intestinal distress.)  The jokes are about what you would expect of this kind of comedy, but compared to ""Ted,"" they are fairly inoffensive.  Some of it reminded me of ""Austin Powers,"" other parts of Monty Python movies.  Overall, compared to the movie offerings currently out there, you could do a lot worse than see this one if you're looking for a comedy.",1401494400,21,1979,4.892215568862276
6366082,4,B00JKE4SVE,"""A Million Ways To Die In the West"" (2014 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Albert, who hates it in the west but somehow ended up in a frontier place called Old Stump, Arizona (in 1882, as we are reminded at the beginning). Albert is a loveable loser-nerd, and as the movie opens we see his girlfriend Louise break up with him after he (again) wimped out of a gun fight. Not long thereafter, a beautiful woman Anna and her brother arrive in town. Anna strikes up a friendship with Albert, and decides to teach him how to shoot and train him for a gun duel with Foy, Louise's new boyfriend. To tell you much more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the Seth MacFarlane show from start to finish, as he stars, co-wrote, produced and directed this movie. Second, the only thing anyone really cares about: how funny is the movie? The answer: it is very funny at times (""you shouldn't drink and horse"", ha!, the ""mustache"" song-and-dance; when Albert trips on drugs, etc.), yet misfires just as much. In that sense, this movie is wildly uneven, and frankly not nearly as consistently funny as ""Ted"" was. Third, keep an eye out for the multiple cameos throughout the movie, up to the very, very end! Fourth, this movie reminds me why Charlize Theron is such a great leading actress, as she oozes charm from start to finish (and outshines MacFarlane on the screen). Last but certainly not least, there is a fantastic musical score for the movie, very much in the classical western sense, composed by Joel McNeely, and I can't wait to check out the soundtrack.

Bottom line: ""A Million Ways To Die In the West"" is not bad but certainly not great. Quite honestly, I can't understand how people can give this 5 stars (as in: this is a perfect movie!). The late matinee screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati today was poorly attended (I counted all of 5 people, including myself, in a HUGE theater), but you may wish to check this out for yourself and draw your own conclusions, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1401408000,2,2114,4.531413612565445
6366083,5,B00JKE4SVE,"At times it's rude, profane and violent. Also, some scenes involve sexual references and toilet humor.

Nonetheless, I thought this was a clever and entertaining movie- a send up Western, in the tradition of ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Evil Roy Slade"".

The opening is terrific: a great Western score, and beautiful cinematography capturing the natural beauty of Monument Valley in Utah.

The story is a simple one- but if you like this kind of humor, it's done well.

The cast is uniformly excellent- Seth MacFarlane shows a deft comic touch as star, writer and director, as well as contributing his talent to songs in the movie- the dance hall scene with the band performing ""If you've only got a moustache"" is a show stopper.

Charlie Theron shows another side as a comic talent, and the remainder of the cast are experienced comedy players. Liam Neeson is a suitably nasty gunslinger.

There are some surprise cameo appearances which add to the enjoyment of this carefully contrived amusement.

On the whole, this a well made light comedy entertainment. The music is great and the cinematography is gorgeous.

Be sure to watch the credits all the way to the end:)

Well worth seeing, unless you find this genre of humor offensive or in poor taste.",1401408000,9,1246,4.867298578199052
6366084,5,B00JKE4SVE,"Seth MacFarlane (""Ted"") wrote, directed and starred in this VERY R-rated Western that sends up the genre, even though everyone plays it straight!

From the first note of the classic Western score by Joel McNeely and the first breathtaking shot of Monument Valley, Utah by cinematographer Michael Barrett, I knew we were in for a full-out gallop! Be prepared for a lewd, racist, raunchy, sexist, gross, clichd, disgusting, scatological, 116 laugh-out-loud minutes. I can't begin to tell you the surprise guests; you wouldn't believe me anyway.

If you've seen ""Ted"" there are very few surprises. This movie is violent (someone is crushed to death), profane (it's Seth MacFarlane!), has gunfights (it's a Western), but not one bit of blowie uppie stuff. It veers wildly amid contemporary topical humor, in-crowd jokes and parodies of ""real"" westerns, ...all done with a tip of the Stetson, an unorthodox showdown, and a straight face.

This is the cast:
  * Seth MacFarlane (""Family Guy"") is Albert, a straight-arrow sheep farmer in love with Louise, a big-eyed charmer, who is getting really bored.
  * Amanda Seyfried (""The Big Wedding"") Louise is bored, bored, bored.
  * Neil Patrick Harris (""The Smurfs"") is Foy, who has a dashing mustache and is NOT boring!
  * Giovanni Ribisi (""Gangster Squad"") is the virginal Edward, engaged these many years to....
  * Sarah Silverman (""Gravy"") Ruth is a working girl with a heart of gold...and a potty mouth. She wears a crucifix and lovingly declines premarital sex with Edward because ""We're Christians!""
  * Charlize Theron (""Promethius"") is Anna, the mysterious new woman in town who takes a shine to our brow-beaten hero. I have never seen Theron sling a gun or do comedy before and she's terrific!
  * Liam Neeson (""Non-Stop"") is Clinch (great name!), Anna's husband, a notorious gunman come to settle the score because he has heard a rumor about his wife.... Watch how she gives him a flower!

There are times when people are not in the mood for a socially redeeming film, but instead want a knock-down, drag-out comedy. That was our audience tonight; we had a great time. I'll own the DVD from Amazon because I know I missed some great one-liners.",1401408000,6,2198,4.975342465753425

6366207,3,B00JKE4SVE,"RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by Seth MacFarlane, A Million Ways to Die in the West stars MacFarlane as a yella sheep-rancher in an Old West town near Monument Valley. While grieving a breakup with his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) he starts a friendship with a hot blonde stranger in town (Charlize Theron), which isn't good because shes secretly the wife of a notorious gunslinger (Liam Neeson). Giovanni Ribisi plays the sheep-ranchers best friend and Sara Silverman his prostitute fianc. Neil Patrick Harris plays the ex-girlfriends new beau while Wes Studi appears in the third act.

If you can look beyond the vulgar potty humor (with WAY too many d-word jokes), this is arguably the best Western comedy, speaking as one whos seen most of em. The characters are memorable, the story is compelling and the dialogues are snappy, all with a quasi-realistic tone offset by absurd humor. I laughed throughout even while I winced or groaned at the puerile vulgarities. Theron is stunning and Im not even a fan (she definitely got better with age). There are a few notable cameos with a great one involving a barn with a mysterious light; and another one at the very end. The Western locations are of the highest order.

Too bad it's nigh ruined by the constant obnoxious non-humor.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 56 minutes and was shot in Santa Fe & Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico; Monument Valley, Utah/Arizona; Antonito, Colorado; and Mexican Water, Arizona. ADDITIONAL WRITERS: Alec Sulkin & Wellesley Wild.

6366245,1,B00JKE4SVE,"Quite possibly the worst satire I have ever seen. If you are expecting an Abrams brothers (the Airplane movies0 type of clever satire or the Wayans brothers (Scary Movie) type of humorous take on western movies, you are out of luck here. Seth McFarlane just simply isn't funny and someone needs to tell him so we can stop being subjected to his level of dreck that he mistakenly tries to classify as humor. This film came off as a low IQ, drunken frat boy's attempt at tearing apart the cliche riddled classic westerns. When it's not annoying you with immature sex and toilet humor it's trying to be a too serious actual cowboy movie and the whole blending of the formula doesn't work.

Where films like Airplane and Scary Movie had clever sight gags going on in what were supposed to be serious scenes to keep the comedic aspect of the whole thing alive, McFarlane doesn't choose that time tested comedic send up. Instead, we are bored to tears for long periods of time until the next raunchy or inappropriate bit. And don't get me started on the cursing. I was under the impression that even in an R rated movie you can only get away with the 'F' word a certain number of times but it is dropped in so much, it's the only word in the dialogue you remember.

Certain scenes also are horribly timed. For example, Neil Patrick Harris's character before a shootout is stricken with the worst case of diarrea ever included in a comedy movie, and I mean that in a bad way. The scene goes on and on with him clutching himself and walking awkwardly and depositing his liquid assets into two people's hats. As if that's not bad enough, after the endless scene, we are treated to a close up of Harris's foot tripping over and spilling one of the hats. Yeah, beyond disgusting and anything but funny. In another scene we are treated to McFarlane hiding in a herd of sheep and being peed on by one of them, the only time I cheered during this mess of a film because it felt like justice for him subjecting us to his awful take on the old west, but then we are subjected to his 'bad trip' with some wise Native Americans and a chorus line of male sheep doing kicks ala the radio city chorus line girls while peeing, genetalia in your face.

Even the 3 cameos weren't enough to make it worth watching because the humor was wasted in this unfunny waste of time. Plus, even Giovanni Ribisi, a great actor, couldn't save the film from falling flat.

The bottom line is, there haven't been many times the old west has been given the satire treatment, but if you want to laugh at the old west, you're simply better off watching Blazing Saddles again, even if you've seen it a dozen or more times it will still be far more entertaining than A Million Ways to Die in the West. .",1512345600,,2759,4.403921568627451

There is something to say about part of it,something smart with the idea of the jokes today viewing the west then! But it just didn't translate to a film. Would have been better is a spoof Time Travel Guide, What to watch Out for it in the west. But kept more like what you get in the class room?

6366277,3,B00JKE4SVE,"The theatrical previews for this movie were the funniest thing about it. If you came wanting to see a lot more oddcap death shenanigans then youll be disappointed because you only get a few more. Seth MacFarlane fans are going to get more of the same. For those who find him too crass, well, yep! Youll get that too. The anachronistic aspect of MacFarlanes character makes for sometimes funny and jaded commentary about the sanitized and idealized (and Hollywood-ized?) old wild American west, but its all pretty cheap and it isn't trying to make any real statement. Thats fine. Its a comedy, and it only really has being a comedy on its mind. It does go someplace you don't really expect, so it fits MacFarlanes MO in that respect too. It earns its R rating for crass sexual subject matter (not shown) and for f-bombs that would fill up a spittoon. I cant say that Im a MacFarlane fan; I liked some of the skewed humor but I just don't find going blue to be that funny. I think that shows a lack of intelligence.",1503273600,,1013,4.481081081081081

I felt it was a pretty natural way two people would hang out together and eventually fall for each other. That may be the problem with this movie. It can't seem to get the comedy right. Neil Patrick Harris pooping into a hat? I get raunchy and smart comedy but, even ""Family Guy"" is super clever in its bits that go over the taste top.

I felt the other characters just were of no interest at all. Amanda Seyfried is wasted as a doe-eyed Alison Brie type in this. I mean, she has less than a few paragrpahs of dialogue in the whole thing.

The cameos are pretty sharp as blink and you'll miss Ewan MacGregor, Ryan Reynolds...and don't cut the movie off through the credits as Jamie Django Fox appears! Plus there's a dandy cameo from the future as well.

DVD extras have a Making Of that I found better than the actual movie. I was fascinated by the locations. There's a gag reel--also unfunny.

6366366,2,B00JKE4SVE,"A promising concept for a good (though still not great) western farce gets buried beneath wagonloads of misfired, indulgent gags that undermine and ultimately smother the genuinely amusing moments.  Seth MacFarlane is a clever, funny guy but hes not the best candidate for the lead role in a feature-length comedy.  Not even one he directed and co-wrote.  His limitations as an actor are further highlighted by the superior performances of his co-stars, especially Charlize Theron, who effortlessly draws attention away from MacFarlane in all of their scenes together.  MacFarlane doesnt play a character firmly (or even loosely) based in reality (or the reality dictated by the terms of his wild, absurdist farce), so his later attempts to tug at the audiences heartstrings falls flat.  We laugh at some of the jokes he delivers but he hasn't given us any reason to sympathize with his empty-vessel portrayal.
Its no surprise that the movie is (over) loaded with crude humor.  The surprise is how uninspired much of the humor is, such as the lazy, repeated reliance on dropping the F-bomb, as though it would transform lame punchlines into hilarious material.  Crude humor can indeed be hilarious, as Mel Brooks has proven.  Yet vulgarity simply for the sake of vulgarity, without the inspired wit of someone like Brooks at the helm, becomes wearisome, as this film illustratesperhaps not in a million ways, but frequently enough.  Stick with BLAZING SADDLES.",1491523200,,1460,5.1525423728813555

Knowing you can do what ever you put your mind to and you don't have to be like everyone else. Take the humor in life through everything and make sure you know who you are and who you want to be.

6366551,5,B00JKE4SVE,"'Family Guy' humor is based on short cut-away gags that may or may not advance the story, like ""That's like the time when... "" and anti-Jewish humor. Well, this movie has no cut-aways, and the only Jewish reference is- Anna: ""I told him I'm half Jewish"" Albert: ""Are you?"" Anna: ""No."" Albert: ""Whew!""
""A Million..."" is NOT ""Family Guy"" and I really like family guy.  I love this movie.  It was not the classic western filmed in the ""golden age of Hollywood"", but in HD it actually looked better.  It has beautifully filmed scenic locations that make you feel you were actually out on the frontier and not in a theme park. It was very funny, but dispite what you may have heard, every moment was not just for laughs,( like tv shows like ""2 Broke Girls"" with the audience roaring every 20 seconds. ) It was an adventure with some heart.
If you are a ""Sophisticate"" or too cool for school, forget it.

The reviews were to bad and I thought I could skip a few things and it would be ok but it wasn't ok. this movie was raunchy. a few parts funny but overall not worth the money or eyes watching. I don't recommend it. I was very dispointed. i was hoping it would be a funny western. but it wasn't. They could have left out alot of the sexual jokes and the language. I was very offended by the Christian remarks over sex. The girlfriend is a prostitute but calls herself a christian and promises to her boyfriend that they want to wait for marriage!! yet shes raunchy and gives her self hardcore to all the men?!!! what??? I AM SORRY  but that is not how it works. I am a Christian and I disagree with this movie 100% I never should have watched this movie. I am sad that i did. But if i can take my wrong choice and encourage anyone and warn them against this movie I want to say this '' If there are  any Christians out there that are like me and believe in what I believe about Sex and Gods idea of it and the fact that they gave him a bad reputation in this movie. You will agree and warn anyone with these beliefs not to see this movie.

The first time I watched this, it instantly became a favorite comedy. I still laugh out loud every time I watch it. My girlfriend didn't want to watch it at first because she though it looked stupid, but it's now one of her favorites as well. Look past the negative reviews and give it a chance. MacFarlane is a comedic genius. This being his first starring role, I thought he did an awesome job. Charlize Theron looks gorgeous in this film. Her character is likable and funny. Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi are also hilarious. Liam Neeson plays a convincing villain and Theron and MacFarlane have an almost believable chemistry throughout.

6366981,1,B00JKE4SVE,"I wanted to like this -- I really did.  Unfortunately, there's too much wrong with it.  At the heart of the film's issues is neurotic writing: Narcissistic characters, absorbed in weird self-deprecating guilt narratives, treat each other as little more than props, even when they're clumsily declaring love for each other.  As a result, we, the viewers, lose interest in the outcome. I found myself just not caring about any of the characters, and not believing the ""love"" story.

I've never really bought into the 90's and 00's values system that garrulously confessing insensitivity, accepting complicit guilt, is somehow heroism, or if not quite that, likeability. So I find that model of hero/antihero development just strange. MacFarlane muddies the waters, too, after treating Native Americans with hand-wringing apology and running a guilt trip on us, by asking us to laugh at people with dwarfism...for no other reason than that they are affected with dwarfism.  By the time that scene rolls around, you as a viewer have bought into the movie's attempt to be self-consciously ""correct"" about things like race and disabilities...why then, you ask yourself while the little people run after the film's hero with guns cocked -- a perfectly rational reaction for them within the context of the scene -- is the scene supposed to be funny?  I generally deplore political correctness -- I bore of pedantry -- but can somewhat associated with this film explain why that scene was supposed to be funny?  Dwarfism by itself just isn't funny. The film's inconsistency about how PC it wants to be is one of its myriad internal conflicts.

MacFarlane should have studied Yojimbo/The Man with No Name to develop an archetype for the Western hero, so at least his characters could have fit into that ethos, instead of -- what is it?  Friends?  I have no cinematic reference point for the ....well, wimpish self-absorption of the film's hero.  Watching this movie is a little like sitting in a coffee shop next to a table of obnoxious Millennials, all of whom are sharing unfunny inside jokes too loudly -- and not being able to switch to a different table.

There are also strange, tacked-on, afterthought scenes in the film that contribute to the incoherent narrative.  These are scenes in which wolves drag off a corpse or the sheriff gets murdered, but in so doing, humor isn't achieved, and the plot isn't advanced. Very few scenes are actually either funny or important for advancing the story.  There is even a bizarre, unexplained Back to the Future reference, and an obligatory PC Let's-be-kind-to-Native-Americans sequence, accented with an unimaginative, boring, and unfunny drug-induced fancy CG hallucination.

Then, let's be honest, folks: Diarrhea, flatulence, sheep's urine, and people affected by dwarfism, really hasn't been funny to us since, what?  Second grade, maybe?  Crass elementary-school humor tried, but failed to accommodate for the bloodless acting and humorless script.

The filmcraft was poorly thought out, too....from soundstages with echos and too-blue studio lighting standing in for outdoors, to sophomoric camera angles, cliche lens choices, to inattentive management of composition, background, lens flare, you name it....to disparate outdoor locations that are so different in climate and so obviously several dozen if not hundreds of miles apart, it quite often eliminates suspension of disbelief...only someone who doesn't live out here and rarely visits could believe that these locations are all within a mile or two of the same town.  Sorry Californians: Shiprock and Monument Valley just ain't Chama, and neither one is Santa Fe.  Only a Californian would think that they are credibly in the same place. MacFarlane was obviously had by the New Mexico and Arizona Depts.of Tourism.

Finally, the disparagement of the West becomes tedious.  It's like listening to a Californian who knows jack about the history or culture of the West but has decided to make fun of it anyway...and in so doing, is just revealing more about his prejudices about the West than the actual West itself.  MacFarlane could've made fun of spaghetti westerns, or of the Millennial social conscience, but he chose instead to take an ill-informed and mean-spirited poke at the West.  Unfortunately, MacFarlane just comes across as yet another tendentious and ignorant person from one of the coasts.",1452643200,,4407,5.209631728045326

6366993,4,B00JKE4SVE,"I have never really found Seth MacFarlane funny. But rather mildly amusing. I don't love some of his more gross out humor but I do admire how long and aggressively he goes for the joke.  That kind of sums up why I liked this movie. It wasn't make me laugh out loud funny but I had a smile on my face the entire time. Seth plays a lovable guy in the west but, the humor comes from the idea that all the characters are in the west but act and joke like we would today. Seth's girlfriend breaks up with him and he generally hates the west until one day he meets Anna. Anna happens to be the (forced) wife of the worst killer in the west. Anna is just there temporarily, also hates the west (they bond over mutual hate) and doesn't plan to but fall in love with Albert but she does putting Albert in a bad position when he finds out who Anna really is and hubbie comes looking for the guy who was seen making out with his wife. Not appointment viewing but a good movie.  If you are easily offended or don't like toilet humor i might not recommend it but, you probably should never watch anything from Seth MacFarlane.",1452297600,,1113,4.1720930232558135
6366994,5,B00JKE4SVE,"Most people would consider this movie a ""bad flick"" if they literally sat through about the first twenty minutes of it. However, this flick does add a little bit of a twist considering all the humor and the male-female subversion trope. I thought it was relatively enjoyable because the humor is rather spread out. Some jokes for adults, some  for kids, some for western history people and other audiences. The plot is rather simple, however, it allows itself to remain fresh by foreshadowing certain events, which allows it's extension from an hour to longer, to feel more natural rather than an ass pull. The acting is somewhat bland and could use work, however for alot of the dialogue in this movie, not alot of drama is needed and the downplayed acting actually works for a majority of the jokes. Overall, this work is relatively well written with jokes actually factoring into the plot, character that seem bland but are still lovable, and Seth's portrayal as the loser main character who goes on a journey to get more courage. This movie made me laugh and it really did make me feel heartfelt with the way it was written and teh genius that came into alot of the jokes. Fine, some were a bit ridiculous, and some were pretty odd in placement, but overall this movie was worth all the money and really enjoyable.",1452211200,5,1318,4.681034482758621

6367158,5,B00JKE4SVE,"The crux of comedy is this: Does it make you laugh out loud? With ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" the answer is simply YES. This is the most outrageously laugh-out-loud movie I've seen in many years. I had almost given up on movie comedy altogether: in the past decade, television has produced gems of true hysteria such as ""30 Rock"" and ""Archer,"" while the big screen has seldom been good for anything better than a small chuckle. MacFarlane, like Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker with ""Airplane,"" pulls out all the stops and delivers big laughs by the bucketful. Situational humor, verbal humor, toilet humor, black comedy, inspired sight gags--it's all here.

This movie has some weaknesses; if Amazon allowed, I would have given 4 1/2 stars instead of 5. But the weaknesses are relatively minor compared to the quantity and quality of the laughs. Liam Neeson fails at playing the psychopathic bad guy, and the lovely Charlize Theron is surprisingly wooden in her co-starring role. The script uses the F-bomb so gratuitously that it loses some of its comic potential. But even with regard to the minor issues, the movie has some serious plusses. The cinematography beautifully captures those breathtaking Wild West landscapes. Most of the supporting cast performs perfectly, from Sarah Silverman on down. The music is delightfully schmaltzy--a parody of the Western genre all by itself.

What about all the negative reviews? How come so many people thought it wasn't funny? Beyond the cliche that there's no accounting for taste, I think the problem may be that this movie plays more like a feature-length adult cartoon than a conventional live-action film. If you're willing to watch it on its own terms, you will laugh yourself silly; if you can't accept its cartoonish nature, you'll probably agree with the one-star reviewers.",1441756800,3,1828,5.069767441860465

I loved family guy before it was popular, before Fox cancelled it. American dad has its moments as well. One million is simply awful.

The main character constantly complains about living in the west during the 1800s. It seemed like Seth took all of his hatred for the genre and unloaded his thoughts into this movie. This might have been a decent 5 minute short film, but a 2 hour long movie was far too ambitious.

My wife gave up after watching for 20 minutes. I thought it would eventually improve, it had to. Sadly, it stayed at a constant lull throughout. It hit an extremely low point during the spiritual vision scene with the peeing sheep. Of course, I'm guessing most stopped watching long before this point.

There are three types of movies in my book: Ones I will gladly watch again, ones that I will watch again if they come on TV or cross my path, and ones that you simply couldn't pay me to watch. This movie falls into the very bottom of the last category. You'd need to pay me a large sum of money for another viewing, and even then I might decline the offer. Yeah, that bad!

6367401,3,B00JKE4SVE,"""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" uses the scenery, camera work, and soundtrack that are too good for such crude, rude, raunchy, tasteless affair as Seth MacFarlane goofy western parody. Somebody said already that the world did not need the whole two minutes of Neil Patrick Harris's manifestations of the upset stomach and public defecation in somebody's hat not once but twice. The joke about a virgin guy in love with the town prostitute who would not have sex with him before the wedding was funny once (barely) not ten times. If MacFarlane had taken it easy (ier) on the jokes involving farts, pissing sheep, crude sexual references , etc, and decreased running time from 116 minutes to, say, 90 or 85, the movie might have been much better and funnier. There are a million ways to die in the west. Dying from constant laughing while watching this movie is not one of them. With all this said Albert's (MacFarlane) drug-induced trip close to the end is truly wonderful, creative, funny scene that re-invents the word ""surreal"". He deserves a credit for casting Charlize Theron as the female lead, Liam Neeson as the devious villain, and Neil Patrick Harris as the pompous mustached mustachery owner. It is always nice to see them on the screen, and they seemed to enjoy making fun out of the weird situations and the fools out of themselves. There are million ways to spend your time during the weekend, and Steve MacFarlane's western-parody comedy while, certainly, not the best of them, is not the worst.",1433203200,,1513,4.778625954198473

A Million Ways to die in the West was more than a ridiculous farce of old Western movies, it was really entertaining that kept me laughing throughout the entire film. Seth Macfarlane wrote an amazing script that felt as if the lines were written specifically for the actors casted in the movie and he himself did an amazing job acting as the star.

I expected a lot more ways to die being illustrated.  Well, with the lead character being a practicing pacifist, what do you expect!  A good story.  Good dialog.  Excellent delivery and acting in general.  Some drama, some comedy, some love, some implicit sex, some low moral values, lots of chuckles and a few laughs, some bravery, some fear, some surprises, great music. No noticeable bad language.

6367534,3,B00JKE4SVE,"A guy gets dumped by his girlfriend after backing out of a duel. Then he meets an outlaw's wife, and she teaches him how to shoot. The story goes on from there.

This film is a mixed bag.

Positives: The acting is good. Sarah Silverman is perfect as a prostitute who happens to have a boyfriend. Seth MacFarlane is good in the lead role, while Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron are quite good.

There's some funny parts in the film. Actually, some of the lines are pretty clever, which is surprising for a Seth MacFarlane film. I enjoyed the film's self-conscious attitude.

Negatives: The movie is too long and takes a serious turn that I didn't like. The Native American acid trip scene was unnecessary and unfunny. The movie's over-length deadens of the funny parts. This film would be great if it were 80 minutes. Instead, it is two hours, and there isn't enough laughs to carry a two hour movie.

As stated earlier, the film's serious turn (which occurs in the second half) looks out of place for a zany comedy. It's like McFarlane couldn't decide if he was doing a serious romantic film or a zany comedy during the film's second half.

The bottom line is that the movie has funny parts, but there isn't enough laughs to carry a two hour film. The film would be a classic if it were shorter and had about one or two more laughs. Pity that this film isn't a classic. It's worth a watch, but not worth multiple viewings.",1429920000,,1421,4.467181467181467

Much of the humor is fart humor which is funny a few times but I consider it the SAME joke when it's reused.  One can't make an entire film of fart jokes and have it be funny all the way through.  At some point it becomes boring and leaves the viewer begging for something else.

This movie wouldn't even be funny to teens for long.  It feels like the writers were smoking way too much pot and created a movie that is funny only if you are high and no longer require intelligence to laugh.

6367683,4,B00JKE4SVE,"This movie was hysterical! Realistically, the lack of Academy Awards wasn't exactly a travesty. But it's a very funny movie.

You have to enjoy a certain brand of humor to enjoy this movie. Basically if anything offends you, steer clear of A Million Ways to Die in the West. If the f word makes your ears bleed, this movie is definitely not for you.

But if you can laugh at just about anything, you'll enjoy this film. It's Seth MacFarlane's usual brand of comedy. So if you like Family Guy's style of humor, this will amuse you. If you hate Family Guy's style of humor, you're probably going to hate this movie. I'd also contend that if you enjoy Blazing Saddles that you'll enjoy A Million Ways to Die in the West. The humor is very similar.

Seth MacFarlane plays a guy in the old west who hates the old west. He's more of a modern day city dweller stuck in an old western town, constantly complaining about how backwards the place is and how everything there can kill you.

Charlize Theron shows she had comedy skills in this film too! She's very funny and has great on screen chemistry with Seth MacFarlane. You can tell that they both were cracking each other up during filming because their laughter for each other is pure and genuine.

It's not the most epic plot of all time. Seth MacFarlane gets dumped by his girlfriend, falls in love with Charlize Theron (because...who wouldn't?) and then has to gun fight a couple people in the most clichd ways possible. And it's clichd on purpose, so it's funnier.

There are a ton of Hollywood cameos in this movie as well. You'll find the voice of Lois Griffen tending bar. Mr Belding of Saved By The Bell fame has a bit part. Even Jamie Foxx completely done up as Django Unchained makes a post credits appearance (And it's WELL worth sticking around for because it's hilarious)",1427155200,,1830,4.53030303030303

The F bomb is used in place of actual conversation as if if MacFarlane has Tourettes? Does his keyboard have the whole ""F"" word on it and he doesn't have to type the whole word? Must, as it would be exhausting to type it soooo many times! I really don't think people in the Old West sank low enough to use this word. Don't think it might have been around then. Never saw it in old journals.

And what's with unfunny ""comedian"" Sarah Silverman's fetish with (putting it gently) ""sexual fluids in the face.""

The plot takes regular sexual spins and vulgar dives with the occasional head splattering from the dangers of pioneering life. Among all this calamity sheep farmer Albert Stark (MacFarlane) is trying to stay alive and in love, but the discovery of a special love helps him realise all his potential. Anna Barnes-Leatherwoods (Charlize Theron) own experience of child marriage in the wild west, I married at nine because I didn't want to become a fifteen year old spinster was uncomfortably funny and consistent with the crudeness of the narrative. Storyline interaction with other films such as Back to the Future Part III and Django Unchained added extra fun, and the cast was a solid side-splitting group.

(Possible spoilers ahead)

The premise is amusing, essentially the standard love story of ""nice guy"" trying to win back the girl that dumped him while being helped by the girl who is the better catch anyway, all the while trying to survive the many, many ways there are to get killed in the old west. (Along those lines there's the dead mayor being dragged off by wolves, a photo accident that kills 3 people, a man crushed by a block of ice, etc.) There are other amusing gags as well, such as the conversations about no one ever smiling in photos.

What sinks this movie is the over the top vulgarity and swearing. Swearing can be funny with proper comedic timing. Dropped the ""F"" word every other sentence is not that timing. I'm not really sure who the bathroom humor appeals to either - and the movie does not comprehend the concept of ""subtlety"" (for instance, when Foy is drugged by Anna. His acting sick, or the outhouse run, is enough to get the point across. The bit with the hat was just disgusting).
Also, the worst joke is repeated over and over again is not that funny to begin with. Edward's girlfriend Ruth is a prostitute and he's OK with that, even thought they are ""saving themselves"" for marriage. That gets a chuckle the first time, but that theme is used over and over and over again throughout the movie, as if the writers just want to keep saying, ""look how clever we were with this one! Did you see it? Weren't we clever and funny? Let's show you again so you can be as sure it's as funny as we are!""
The movie is 2 hours long when it should have been no longer than 1 hour 20 minutes. But no, they needed to squeeze in every last little bit of low brow humor that could come up with, often repeated, just to be sure you did not miss any bit of it.

I don't mind crass humor when it's funny, and a few of the jokes were amusing, but the overwhelming majority was just cringe-worthy and completely unfunny. On the ""why would they think this would make a good joke"" level.

6367833,3,B00JKE4SVE,"From the beginning this movie hits you with potty mouth and potty humor. This may be o.k. or even desirable in British comedies. Here it was just down right crude. Even people that enjoy the versatility of English would cringe at the dialog and low level comedy. The high level comedy here was slapstick.

If you get past the crudery and ridiculous scenes, there's a standard formula that you will recognize at once. A sheepherder with a sense of humanity backs down from a Neanderthal confrontation with the gunslinger. His girlfriend finds this attitude not to her liking and departs from his company. Will he get over his loss? Or take it in his stride. Or will he change his ways and loses humanity as he strives to outselling the gunslingers?

Meanwhile back at the ranch a new girl shows up with a mysterious past. She seems to cotton to him and help them make his decisions.

You will have to watch the movie to find out what choices he makes and what results is of those choices.

As I stated originally one would have to have no discerning taste to be able to make it to the end of this film and find out what happens. However on the upside there are a lot of great actors and you believe the parts that they play.",1425081600,7,1223,4.398230088495575

6367901,4,B00JKE4SVE,"All in all I find this was worth watching even though it doesn't come anywhere near weaving an elaborate narrative.  What you have to consider is that this is Seth MacFarlane.  This is a film that attempts to make a joke out of everything.  Many of the jokes miss and many of them hit.  What you won't get out of this film is a narrative that will leave you gripping the edge of your seat.  It is a predictable tale and you will probably guess where the major plot line will go and how it will end very accurately.  This movie won't wow you with it's plot twists.  You will however almost certainly laugh a few times at the ridiculous antics on screen.

If you enjoy the Family Guy type of humor where they just cram as many bits into a show as is possible then you will enjoy this show.  I found my self laughing hysterically at many moments in the movie even if looking at the big picture it isn't the most technically sound motion picture.  My best advice is if you enjoy Seth's brand of comedy give it a shot.

I give it four stars out of five regardless of it's flaws because a comedy's purpose is to make you laugh and this certainly made me laugh only deducting a single star for the plot flaws which to me are of minor importance in a comedy.",1424563200,,1250,4.188284518828452

6368075,4,B00JKE4SVE,"If you read several reviews, you'll get the gist of everything I like about this movie.  I love comedy of any kind, and this one had Mel Brooks style written all over it before I opened the box.  I liked most of the humor, most of the gags, and certainly no problem with the stupid plot and sub plots which carried the story along quite well.  Loved the location shooting, too.  My problem was the language and bathroom humor - too much of both.  I'm no prude, but the f word every few minutes seemed like an overkill contest, how many times can we work it in?  And my only other problem was Seth.  Really, he was totally mis-cast as this character.  He should have stepped back on this one and hired any of good comic actors to pull this off.  (look at Wagons East, or Blazing Saddles) And, overall, way too many white teeth.  I know this is trendy in Hollywood now, but, cowboys from the 1800's?  I know they could make them more period for authenticity, ugly, black, missing.  Still, I'll stay with 4 stars, Had a good time.  Also enjoyed the extras, except for the commentary track, too sleepy to make it through.",1423526400,,1117,4.364077669902913

6368078,3,B00JKE4SVE,"Like Ted, A Million Ways to Die in the West is co-written, directed and starring Seth MacFarlane, but this time you don't see a speaking teddy bear. You may think that's a big minus, and yes, you are right. The film has funny moments to be sure, but, besides Seth MacFarlanes rather bland live-action performance, his new film suffers from the weak storytelling as well as the lack of an interesting hero (and heroine) and strong villain.

Set in 1882, Arizona, the western comedy film is about a timid sheep farmer Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane), who has just been dumped by Louise (Amanda Seyfried). But soon Albert meets and falls for a gorgeous and mysterious gunwoman Anna (Charlize Theron). Of course, Anna has a big secret to hide, a secret that has to do with a notorious outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson).

Somehow A Million Ways to Die in the West needs nearly two hours to tell this simple story that occasionally seems to forget where it is going. The film looks great, sounds great (Joel McNeelys soundtrack alone is worth listening to), and has a great cast of players including Giovanni Ribisi, Neil Patrick Harris and Sarah Silverman. Some jokes are hilarious and there are some funny cameo appearances from famous stars, but the overlong film itself is a mixed bag.",1423440000,3,1288,4.797297297297297

6368081,2,B00JKE4SVE,"The previews seemed promising... It seems almost impossible to find anyone trying to be funny anymore, without being nastily crude and profane. I am far from a prude, and occasional and well placed profanity can be hilarious. That said, people ought to be able to string three sentences together without cursing. Todays generation seems to equate putting an F word in front of almost every other exclamation as worthy of hilarity.
There are also quite a few ways to be funny without it involving a penis or a vagina. Although I can see why lazy movie makers, comedians and song writers fall back on that, with todays audience it always works. This movie had a ton of promise in the concept, too bad it took the easy way out.",1423353600,,724,4.62015503875969
6368092,3,B00JKE4SVE,"I have wanted to see this for a long time.  I like the type of humor this guy does.  I have owned this for a bit.  Ive just had a lot of movies on our DVR.  I have an hour and fourteen minutes left.  Here is my opinion so far.  I will finish this tomorrow.

So, the movie is set in the 1800s.  It takes place in the Wild West.  A mans girlfriend leaves him.  Somehow, the man she is with now, and he, set up a gun match.  You know, draw!  The movie is about him getting ready.  It just so happens that a new lady arrives and decided to help the man learn to shoot.  He is very bad at it.  Other things come into play.  They have to do with the lady and her companions.  I do not want to ruin anything.

The movie has the same type of humor that Family Guy does.  Crazy, off the wall type stuff.  At times, they will just show a scene with something happening to someone.  No point or reason.  Just wackiness.  It is all rather funny.  I just laughed and laughed.

Now, why the three out of five?  Well, so far, this is my problem with the movie.  I guess I should say problems.  The cast, not one of them seems to be connected at all.  There is no emotion, no connection, just people talking.  It feels like I am watching a continuation of skits.  It is a shame.  There are so many good actors.

As I said, this is slapstick.  It is funny so far.  But, the problem is this.  Now, maybe it is the writing, maybe it is the acting.  It could be a combination of both.  But, whenever they start talking about something serious, my god, it just seems to drag on and on and on.  I think the movie sets your mind into a specific expectation.  You set yourself in this mode and when the movie switches, your mind is not ready for it.  I kind of just faded away when they talked.  I guess I could say when they babbled.  I am watching the unrated version, which is 2 hours and 14 minutes.  Maybe that is the thing.  I will have to finish the movie, so I can do the same with the review.

Ok, I finished the movie last night.  It really was funny.  It had an ending that made me smile.  A lot of the stuff in the movie seemed to work it self out.  It was all good.

Now, for things that I do not think worked.  I said earlier, that the cast seemed to not at all be on the same page.  I think now, it is for the fact that everyone, even the people you only would see for a minute, had such odd, stand-outish personalities.  Everyone seemed important in the small town.  Maybe if they had not tried so hard to make each character memorable, it would have been better.

I watched the special features.  I know MacFarline is a great music guy.  I love the movie in his other stuff.  I did like the music in the movie.  But, to me, it just did not fit.  It felt like I was watching a sci-fi movie, or a horror.  I believe, there were to many of one thing.  It was either wind or string instruments.  It just over did everything.  The song that played as the end credits rolled, I think that song fit the movie best.  I am not talking about the words or what the song was about.  I mean the type of music and the way the vocals sounded.  I don't know.  Just something about the music didn't work.  I said that the parts in which they would talk about serious stuff just seemed to drag on and on.  It did not really seem that way in the end.  The last few things flowed better than they did at first.

So, there it is.  Also, there are some fun special features.  The longest is like ten minutes and something.  Not bad.  You find out some interesting things.  I am 100% happy with my purchase of the movie.  I will watch it many times throughout my life.

Ok, this is a bit pointless I guess.  MacFarlines character says something in the movie.  It is about some disease.  His character says something like it is just another way that God shows us how much he loves us.  I am not offended by it.  Everyone has his or her views.  I never really believed in stuff like that.  Someone killed me in 03.  There was my dad and God.  Kind of changed the way I think.  The thing I wanted to say is this.  I know someone who thinks the same way.  If there were a God, why would he let people suffer and die?  I believe the reason for that is free will for one.  People live their lives the way they wish.  The way you live sets up your life.  Would people be happier if they had to follow strict guidelines?  Two evolution.  Think about it.  If people never died, that would have to mean that people would eventually stop being born.  The earthy would get far to full.  If there were a set number of humans, and that was it.  How would anything ever grow?  Things change in the world because new people come along, see what was and make what is.  You live, you die, others continue.  That seems like the best way for things to be.  Finally, to allow humans to live forever would not be enough.  People would start to hate each other.  Always seeing the same people.  No change.  So, you would also have to allow people to love and never hate or fight.  Never get sick.  What if you got cancer?  You would have to suffer forever.  Nobody would be able to ever create a way to fix the disease, for the fact that there was no evolution.  If people want a life, with peace, no death, no sickness, no bad things and think that is the way life should be, then why would God have even made an Earth for humans to live on?  He would just have had everyone exist in Heaven.

That is just something I wanted to say.  I know nothing about the bible or any of that stuff.  It just felt like something important for me to say.  Again, I have no problems with jokes, religion, political views or anything.  I just knew right away that I wanted to say what I said.  There it is.  Peace.

Oh, I did love the setting of the movie.  I do not think I have ever watched a western.  Everything was beautiful.  Also, if they made another movie that went with this story, I would be very excited to see it.  I really like this movie.  But, there were just some things that seemed to not fit.  This the 3 out of 5.",1423353600,2,6065,4.051914893617021

6368147,2,B00JKE4SVE,"Well, Seth MacFarlane is certainly no Mel Brooks or Monty Python. This looked like it would either be funny or really bad. It was the latter. It was unwatchable. It wasn't even a movie. It was a 'Family Guy' episode drawn out too long with live actors playing the same parts under different character names. 'Family Guy' is hit or miss for me. This movie was mostly miss. I was expecting 'Blazing Saddle' and instead got one indulgent diatribe after the other with no cohesive story and terrible acting on Seth MacFarlane's part, if you even want to call it that. There were so many actors in this film that I normally like and all I could think the whole time is, ""How did he get them to sign up for this film? Once they started the film did they wonder the same thing?""

All I can think is that maybe Seth MacFarlane was drinking a lot when he wrote this script or he's gotten a Quinten Tarentino inflated ego where he now believes everything out of his mouth is gold, and makes the rest of us suffer and listen. He really needs to reel it back, start from scratch and gain some perspective 'cause this is literally the worst movie I've seen in a while and I watch a lot of movies. I would say it's 'Garbage Pail Kids' kinda bad with a few humorous moments thrown in, or that really terrible sic-fi Scientology movie with John Travolta.

In this movie he's overall offensive to everyone. I know he does this bit in 'Family Guy' but it doesn't really work when you have real people saying it instead of cartoons. It just comes of racist, weird, and inappropriate. He literally throws out an Asian joke within the first few minutes of the movie which sets off an uncomfortable tone from the start. I would have to think the big named actors are embarrassed in retrospect that they participated in this since they come off like the inappropriate jokes you would hear or tell when you're in elementary school and don't know any better. Also, the constant language is so overused it's not funny and loses the joke. It just seems, again, like the kind of thing a 12-yr-old boy would think is funny because they're hearing words and things said that they're not supposed to.

I think Seth MacFarlane would be better off staying behind the camera and sticking to cartoons. His handling of this film was incompetent and amateur and he made it clear he doesn't know how to make a film, act, or write a screenplay. Did he direct this film too? That was also terrible. And I am saying this from the point of view of finding his inappropriate Oscar Awards speeches funny, so, I'm not a hater, I just thought this film downright stunk.",1422748800,2,2623,4.471816283924843

The choice of Charlize Theron as the female lead was excellent. Sexy, funny, a side of her I haven't seen in years. Why they keep using her in films as the bad-girl I'll never know, because she truly brought it in this one. Liam Neeson is perfect as the bad-guy murderous gunslinger husband of Seth's love interest. The film features some top talent including Neil Patrick Harris, and Giovanni Ribisi and contains one of the most violent yet funny bar-fights I've ever seen.

6368187,2,B00JKE4SVE,"Seth MacFarlane writes and produces two of the funniest shows on TV. Any episode of Family Guy or American Dad is at least twice as funny as this movie of his. I  don't know what went wrong. Well partly I do. He should have not starred in it. He is very talented in many areas but his acting is a bit wooden. Another actor taking his part and saying his funny lines would have at least marginally improved the movie. That said, someone at the studio should have just axed this before it ever saw life. The premise is not that funny and most of the jokes just fall flat. If you want to see Western comedy done right there are several classic films to choose from including Blazing Saddles and The Shakiest Gun in the West with Don Knotts. Even Cat Ballou, Paint Your wagon, and the The Hallelujah Trail offer much more entertainment than this misfire.",1422403200,,850,4.379746835443038

One of the running jokes is how everything in the West can kill you (especially at the fair), and these generally come out of nowhere and are just absurd (and absurdly gross).

This is a nice-guys-finish-first movie, about the developing relationship between a nerdy sheep farmer and a gunslinger's wife. Even against the backdrop of people being incinerated and impaled, this turns out to be a really sweet story.

6368424,1,B00JKE4SVE,"If Seth MacFarlane's worst enemy was tasked with making a movie to embarrass and humiliate the actor/filmmaker, they'd be hard-pressed to match this horrific misfire from the man himself. This movie is really that bad.

To start with some rare and minor successes of the film: The Western settings and costumes are skillfully recreated. There are a few interesting cameos, which are not necessarily funny, but are perhaps a measure of some success in their ability to surprise the viewer. And everyone but MacFarlane acts ably enough in spite of the rotten material.

But that's it. Everything else in this film is not just bad, but despicably and pathetically godawful horrible:

As the lead, MacFarlane is woefully unprepared to carry this movie. Despite the array of emotions he hopes to display to win empathy from the viewer, he's really only calibrated to be a smug bully. In scenes where he's supposedly tenderly entreating compassion or drowning in sad despair, the man still can't hide his cocky, weird smirk.

The plot is as tired as can be. Granted, this film is supposed to be a parody of the genre, but that shouldn't permit the story to settle for the most cliched storyline possible, where every single beat and moment is entirely predictable. Perhaps the framework of the narrative could be used to lend some comedy to the proceedings. But the formulaic plot is not wielded as a source of humor, but is simply a sparse roadmap of where this boring story should plod to next.

All of the above would be forgivable if the movie was actually funny in any manner, shape or form. But the movie is a serious failure in both quality and quantity.

The jokes are bad. Poor setups and punchlines (if any), an over-reliance on shock/gross/crude/offensive humor where vulgar bodily fluids or crass racism are considered hysterical. Now, I'm hardly a prude, having loved this year's ""Neighbors"" and ""22 Jump Street"" as far superior R-rated comedies. And I've always enjoyed ""offensive"" humor classics before like ""South Park"" or ""Kentucky Fried Movie."" So it's hardly as if the material is too shocking and bothers me. It's just lazy, cheap and inane. Making matters worse, the few ""best"" ""jokes"" are spoiled in the commercials.

But maybe worst of all is the lack of attempts to even try to be funny. There are numerous chunks of runtime which play entirely without any attempt at humor whatsoever. Or perhaps a lone joke or two will show up during an extended 5-minute sequence, as the misguided direction somehow hoped one might actually be so engaged with the risible emotions of the cardboard characters or suspense of the predictable plot. Considering spoofs like ""Airplane!"" or even the worst of the ""Scary Movies"" all at least try to jam a plethora of jokes in, this film definitely rates as one kind of absolute failure in its ability or lack of ambition to even try and make you laugh.

tl;dr This movie is horrible in nearly every way.",1420416000,,2950,4.850894632206759

6368583,2,B00JKE4SVE,"Nine Things About the Movie ""A Million Ways To Die in the West""

1. This movie could have been called ""A Million Jokes Die in this Movie"".

2. It's proof that having an all-star cast cannot save a bad script.

3. The plot is cobbled together from other old westerns; an awkward sheep herder named Albert is dumped by his girlfriend. Albert falls in love with a new girl who is secretly married to a gold bandit. They help each other out. The end.

4. This movie is mostly a succession of jokes, with a few serious scenes thrown in. Some of the jokes are funny, and some of the characters are funny. A lot of the jokes and characters are not.

5. Seth MacFarlane is mostly known for creating the TV show ""Family Guy"". This movie was written by Seth MacFarlane, produced by Seth MacFarlane, directed by Seth MacFarlane, and stars Seth MacFarlane. It's his first-ever on-screen acting role.

6. Seth MacFarlane is a terrible actor. There is nothing remotely believable about his character. He just wanders around being Seth MacFarlane, making jokes.

7. Casting Gilbert Gottfried as Abraham Lincoln was one of the worst cinematic decisions of the year.

8. The best joke was set up halfway through movie, but is pretty offensive without the punchline... which doesn't come until the credits start (with another small joke after the credits).

9. This movie is a mess, full of non-sequiturs and random sex and poop jokes. It does have a few really good moments, but on the whole, I felt embarrassed for the actors who agreed to be in the movie.",1419984000,2,1540,4.632352941176471

6368607,1,B00JKE4SVE,"Remembering fondly the way Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles"" ended a forty year long period of Hollywood censorship with a brash, crude, and irreverent movie that parodied Westerns and essentially declared an end to the censorship - we bought this.

It was with some trepidation, of course.  ""Blazing Saddles"" came at a time when such crudity and nonsense were unique and new.  Today, it is commonplace, and inescapable.  And this is one of the reasons why the humor of ""Blazing Saddles"" has not translated to modern day viewings.  Unlike the other Mel Brook comedy, ""Young Frankenstein"", which continues to cause laughs today.

Still, there was hope something might be offered by the all-star cast.

And in this, we were hugely disappointed.  This movie is crude, rude, and annoying without ever being funny.  It is proof that simply being outrageous does not in itself make for humor, good or otherwise.  The crudity isn't imaginative, well written, or otherwise surprising.  It's just crude.  The gags are stretched too long and too far.  Particularly annoying since the gags themselves didn't start out that funny, and carrying them too far didn't fix that.

We decided 10 minutes into the film that it was a dud.  20 minutes in we realized that we had wasted the additional 10 minutes.  At 30 minutes we turned it off.

So, warning:  if you have any sense of humor based on something other than body functions and laughing at the use of bad language, you are probably not going to like this.

If you are a frat boy escaping an overly protective family who kept you locked up until you were 18, you might like it.",1419984000,,1612,4.77536231884058

6368663,4,B00JKE4SVE,"Jeez. People either love this movie or they detest it like a case of Ebola on a Saturday afternoon.  My kinda movie for the simple fact that reviewing it, being honest about it, is going to piss people off immediately.  First off, it's Seth MacFarlane, so it's going to be low-brow.  Figured that out yet?  Why do people expect the wrong things from a movie when there handed all the information they needed to know.  From the maker of Ted.  Did you see Ted?  Please.  Seth MacFarlane is a disgruntled sheep farmer with a desire to be free of the terrors of the west.  When his girlfriend ditches him for the owner of the local Mustachery, he vows to win her back.  The story is thin but the debauched humor is in full effect.  This movie made me laugh.  It is ridiculous and crude, insightful and malignant.  It also has Liam Neeson, so where can you go wrong?  Like I said, by the maker of Ted.  Don't expect high art here.  It's not Shakespeare and its not Borat.  Somewhere in the middle.  If you like American Dad or Family Guy.  If you find toilet humor enticing.  If you can handle Sarah Silverman as a religious whore.  Then by all means take a watch and smile.  It won't kill you.  I promise.  Debauchery sometimes cures what ails you.

Overall, I think the movie was better than it was portrayed to be, and I think some people should give it a second chance. That's how I am with these types of movies.

6368884,2,B00JKE4SVE,"""Destry Rides Again"".  ""Cat Ballou"".  ""Blazing Saddles"".  These are films that sent up the Western form but had an affinity for the genre.  ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" doesn't even come close to joining the rarified company of these cinematic landmarks.  It's not even as good as other sagebrush parodies like ""The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday"" and ""Wagons East"". It doesn't even measure up to the misbegotten sendup ""Rustler's Rhapsody"".  The problem isn't that star-director-writer-producer Seth MacFarlane doesn't know the vocabulary of Western cinema.  Rather, he demonstrates something of a contempt for it and as the main character of the film he comes off as somewhat smarmy.  For sure there are sporadic laughs to be mined here.  I loved the throwaway gag involving Christopher Lloyd.  It's uncertain whether MacFarlane is attempting to revive the Western or bury it.

6368905,1,B00JKE4SVE,"This movie was crude and racist.

Where to begin?

1) Although this movie is purportedly set in the late 19th century, the producer and script writers had the actors and actresses  liberally  dropping the f-bomb. The protagonist ate a cookie laced with marijuana. He also told his ex-girfriend to write to him care of his new girlfriend's vagina ... a totally inappropriate comment given the social mores of the time.

2) Of greater concern was the racism in this movie. Period 19th century clothing had women wearing bustles which made their posteriors stick out. Upon seeing a female friend wearing a bustle, the protagonist said that if he was black, he would be really happy now.

In an earlier part of the film, the protagonist was accused of being ""yellow"", a racist affront he claimed for the Chinese. The film panned to a group of 'coolies"" who gave him the finger.

3) During a gun fight, the protagonist faced off against a man who had diarrhea so bad that he relieved himself in his trousers.

4) This movie even takes a dig at Christians. The protagonist has a best friend who is engaged to a whore ... who refuses ""to be"" with him until they are married because of their ""Christian beliefs"".",1419292800,,1204,4.64622641509434

Instead of a semblance of a story, however silly, this is a progression of unfunny sketches that do not offer any commentary on any issue that would make it remotely entertaining. The level of humor doesn't raise above the night pot. I will never understand why comedy has to be silly or outright stupid to be funny, but even if we hold it to a lower standard in story telling, this one has nothing to hold it together. The bits that were supposed to be smart, sarcastic insights fall flat, without as much as raising a seen-it-coming response. For the most part it feels like Seth MacFarlane didn't stop talking (preaching from a high horse) for the duration of this cruel and unusual mistreatment of talents like Neil Patrick Harris, Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson.

I had no problem with Scarface, Slapshot, Goon, and other movies loaded with F-bombs.  I even made it through ""Ted"" and found it amusing, coming from Boston myself.  I have no problem with sexual innuendos, either.  But, in those other movies, there was at least a context for the language and situations, and perhaps even some humor.  This movie?  Not so much.  The language and sexual references seemed to be gratuitous---and not as funny as Mel Brooks' use of the word ""Sh_t"".  It was as if the writer and director decided to see how many ""bad"" words they could throw in in the shortest possible time, without even trying to make it funny.

So, after no laughs in the first 20 minutes, and increasing incredulity at the direction of the picture, we turned it off after 30 minutes.

There is some witty and actually funny dialogue as well as quite a few humorous moments.  Seth MacFarlane excels as actor, writer, producer, and director and the rest of the cast is great with Liam Neeson doing a different turn as the bad guy.  The secondary characters are just as well-portrayed as the main ones. The story's simple enough: Albert, a nerdy sheepherder, who believes the West is no place for anyone and would really live somewhere else, say...San Francisco, is dumped by his girl who wants someone more forceful and brave. He falls in love with a gunslinger's wife who teaches him how to shoot and returns the love...until her husband rides into town. Through a combination of shooting skill and wit, Albert comes out the hero in the ensuing gunfight. Though this is set in Arizona, it was made in New Mexico and there are lots of scenes of vast buttes rising into the sky from the plains.  The barn dance number is lively and an animated dream sequence brought on when Albert drinks a ""magic potion"" with his Indian friends is inventive and well-done. Surprise, surprise, though there's a lot of sex-talk, there's no real sex in the movie.

It's not a picture for the kiddies, but filtering out the vulgarities, it'll entertain the adults just fine.",1418947200,,1466,4.852

Liam Neeson does a caricature of his usual ""tough guy"" personas as he plays a gunfighter who wears a black hat (literally & figuratively!).  Charlize Theron is the sexiest cowgirl since Madeline Stowe & Andi McDowell starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Girls/dp/B000SVZIMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Girls</a>.  Seth Mcfarline injects a heavy dose of goofiness into the flick, and Neal Patrick Harris is terrific as the pompous ""sophisticated"" cowboy.

One of the most surprising things about the film is that the cinematography of the southwest United States is downright stunning.  One would not expect to see great cinematography in  a film such as this, but Mcfarline wanted it to have the ""feel"" of  a real live western ~ with the slapstick comedic portions thrown in just for fun.

If you liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blazing-Saddles/dp/B0014C3KN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blazing Saddles</a>&nbsp;then you're bound to enjoy this flick as it's cut from the same cloth.

Yes, there is some toilet humor and definately a character I wouldn't have chosen (the prostitute girlfriend of the best friend...not my fav) but the minor irritants aside, we laughed throught the whole movie.

At first glance, this movie has the elements to be great especially with the all-star cast.  Neeson is great as the short tempered outlaw and Theron is good as well as the wife of the outlaw trying to find a new life.  The problem is the movie cant seem to really decide what it wants to be as it switches from light comedy to dark action western to love story romance.  There are some very funny moments in the film but just when you are about to settle into the comedy that you expect, the mood changes to a more serious action western that gets bloody and violent at times and just when you settle into that they throw in the romance and switch moods again.  The individual parts of each of these are good but at times to me, didn't mix well.  I would have liked the western action story as its own movie as I would have like more parody light hearted comedy that showed up from time to time in this movie (not enough comedy moments to me with some attempts at humor not working).

This movie was entertaining but seems to get lost in what it tries to be and in its own way at times.

Seth MacFarlane finally gets in front of the camera instead of just being a writer, director, producer, etc, and he is just as funny in front of the camera as his characters are.  He cracks funny jokes and is hilarious with his observational humor.  Another thing that I loved about this movie was the supporting cast!  Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris were all great in their roles, and even the brief appearance by Christopher Llyod was great!

Plus it had just enough elements of a western in it to remind me of other great western movies and reminded me of how cool that genre can be.

6369477,4,B00JKE4SVE,"I couldn't help thinking that I was watching an update of Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles"" as much of this Western parody feels so much like that now classic film, from the cliche style of font used in the graphics, to the rehashed Copeland-esque Western score (oddly enough, at least one reviewer of the soundtrack loved that, but refuses to watch the film!).  Like the Mel Brooks effort, ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" takes on a Hollywood form that, when Mel Brooks was doing it, was getting replaced at the cinema by space films.  Today we've got modern specimens of the form, including two by the Coen Brothers, ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""True Grit"".  And, ""Rango"".  ""A Million Ways To Die..."" has a story to tell, and like older films, does so at its own pace, such that (when we had to pause the film) we were surprised that we'd only been watching for 45 minutes, when it seemed like so much more time had passed.  It doesn't so much drag as it unfolds.

It has to be noted that it's also a bit crude at times; We've progressed (if that's the accurate word) beyond the farts around the campfire of ""Blazing Saddles"", to the point where sex, and childish obsessions with bodily functions are now fair game for humor, often not adding anything to the film.  The ostentatiously genteel will have issues, then again the seem to like having the opportunity to show all the rest of us how refined they are.  No one will be surprised where Sarah Silverman's character shows up, and she's remarkably restrained, in the role, for Sarah Silverman.

Seth MacFarlane's character is portrayed as a coward, always running away and rarely standing up to the bullies.  When he does, he spouts new age-y warm fuzzies about peace and love, and manages to get the gunslingers to give him extra time---which he then uses to his advantage, even if he loses his girlfriend because of these tendencies, early on.  Then again, the girl he gets is....  spoiler alert...  Of course, what goes un-remarked is that the real cowards are the townsfolk who outnumber the bad badguys and sociopaths by the dozens-to-one, and who never stand up for anything or anyone, and only show up to watch those that do bite the dust, content to ride along on other people's fights, deaths, and whatever benefits may, or may not, accrue.

The film certainly takes its time, yet it generally spends it wisely.  Cultural and Hollywood references abound for those paying attention.  All in all a very entertaining way to pass the time.",1416960000,,2500,4.6477272727272725

I think some of the Audie Murphy movies were funnier and way more beautifully done. My rating is based on why not watch it and see for yourself.

Seth MacFarlane (Director, Lead) would have enhanced his movie greatly by omitting some of the more crude sexual references in the name of innuendo and class, but he chooses to gutter it out, thereby rendering the movie puerile and forgettable.

6369585,5,B00JKE4SVE,"I will start by saying that this movie is not for everyone. It is thoroughly inappropriate, crude, and full of toilet humor. It is also brilliantly-written, hilarious, and filled with an all-star cast who exceed expectations.

I'd never even really heard of the movie before I saw it. Westerns don't usually appeal to me and this looked goofy to top it all off. A movie about a guy who hates his life in the Old West? Boring. But, my fiance said it was one of the funniest movies he'd seen in a long time and that was saying something. Most movies merit only an ""alright"" from him. So into the theater I went with a friend. There were only maybe eight of us in the theater. Besides my friend and me, only one other person ever laughed. We could barely hear him, however, over our own guffawing. If this is your brand of humor, you start laughing and don't stop.

I knew as soon as I left the theater that I would have to buy it and I couldn't pass up the Unrated version. It was definitely worth it. Extra scenes and extra nasty humor.

Seth MacFarlane turns in an amazing performance. You really feel for his plight as the man in a world that will never understand him. For some reason I don't usually care for Charlize Theron, but I really enjoyed her in this role. Liam Neeson steps out of his usual role of rescuer and bad a** and it's refreshing to see that he can poke fun at himself. Giovanni Ribisi and Neil Patrick Harris are so funny and almost steal the show despite their more minimized roles.

I would never show this movie to my grandparents or even my parents. They would never be able to get over their own horror to find any of it funny. However, if you have the sense of humor of a typical 13-year old guy, you'll love it. At its core, it's a movie about a guy who doesn't feel like he fits in and struggles to find someone else who gets it. We can all relate to that, right?",1416441600,2,1893,4.25

Not many westerns come along lately, and the last best western satire was ""Blazing Saddles.""  While the humor is sometimes crude it is always in a light hearted spirit.

- 20 minutes of MacFarlane trying desperately to make today's lingo, including unnecessary f-bombs, fit a 135 year old storyline.

There are some funny parts but mostly it caters to the new train of thought that it has to be tacky or dirty to be funny.  The kind of humor we thought appealed only to 14 year old boys.  A really lousy sheep man is jilted by his girlfriend for a guy who runs a moustache business (apparently this is suppose to be hilarious because it is a main stay of the film).  He meets the wife of the most famous badman in the West and she teaches him how to shot a gun while falling in love with him.  The finale has the outlaw show up.

6369640,2,B00JKE4SVE,"Seth MacFarlane is a comedic genius, who has succeeded in everything from musicals to fart jokes, but could he pull off a romantic comedy, taking place in the wild west? MacFarlane plays Albert, a sheep farmer, who has a reputation for being a coward. After backing out of one duel, he is forced into another, after falling for a woman he didn't know was married to a psychopath. With Seth MacFarlane, you know there is going to a range of comedy from ingenious to low-brow, but this recent film is completely the latter. It is impressive that he got such a large cast to star beside him, but unfortunately they all have very little comedic experience and it shows. Writing, Directing, Casting, and Starring in a film is an admirable feat, but it is completely wasted when the film is a stupid as this one. If your film is going to be rated R, why not go all the way with it? If you take out the sheep fornicating and the fowl language, A Million Ways To Die In The West, is nothing more than an awful kids movie, full of potty jokes, and misleading heroes. The story here is very simplistic and half the time it's not even funny. The parts that are meant to be humerus, turn out to be little more than jokes for the young teens that watch Family Guy. When I saw this film, I was hoping for another unique MacFarlane comedy, like Ted. That film was hilarious and extremely unique. By comparison, A Million Ways To Die In The West is about fifteen minutes of content, and an hour an half of complete and utter nonsense. I suspect some of the big stars in this cast wish they could remove this film from their IMDB page, because it really was that bad.",1416182400,,1650,4.3603896103896105

Maybe because I have been watching AMC's series: 'Hell on Wheels' and recently - finally - binge-watched 'Deadwood', every scene of death, or the potential for it, rang true. Viewing through the comedic lense many of these scenes were outrageously funny.

6369677,1,B00JKE4SVE,"In brief, this is likely one of the ... crappiest movies I've seen in awhile. There was a funny scene in the beginning but the tidal wave of lazily-written misogynist and racist ""jokes"" washed it all away. It doesn't get funny again until Wes Studi and Tatanka Means show up and deliver the best-written segments of the film. Pretty funny stuff.

I've never understood Seth McFarlane's appeal, and I usually can find the funny just about anywhere. That said, this film has no idea what it is. The title is misdirective in that it has no references to Spaghetti Westerns (with the possible inclusion of the sequence where the horses get knocked over--the late Spaghettis devolved into a sort of commedia dell'arte, and scenes like that became the expected norm, along with dynamite [see 1974's MY NAME IS NOBODY for a fine example of death by dynamite]). At its core, it is largely a music/dance film (McFarlane has always been a sort of low-rent Busby Berkeley; I think he [and we] would be far better off if he would just commit to certain things) one supposes, but it has a bit of slapstick and violence along with a villainous Liam Neeson, who phones it all in. Sarah Silverman is occasionally funny by turns, and Giovanni Ribisi is McFarlane's stand-in for it all. Being peed on by a sheep, well, I'm not his analyst, so \_()_/.

The film drags, and sags along, and has an inexplicable and improbable love story to it. I still don't see how Charlize Theron's character got from A to B to C, nor why we need to know that she was a child bride at 9. McFarlane's approach to this work is like most of his other efforts; we feel as if we're watching an angry, conflicted outsider turned loose without conscience, craft, or advanced choreographic skills. Ultimately we feel cheated and in need of a sanitizer.

The best part of the film is Amanda Seyfried, who acts as if she's genuinely pissed off to be in this horrendous production.

As the weather turns, my friends and I decided to stay in a rent this instead of going to the theater. With a few cocktails in hand, this movie certainly fit the bill. The plot is obviously weak, but sound enough to carry you through the humor. We laughed the entire way through and when it ended, we all agreed this movie fit the bill for the night we were wanting to have.

Full of slapstick humor, dirty jokes, and a lot of completely random and irrelevant celebrity cameos (Doc Brown, Mr Belding, Ewan Mcgregor, etc), the only thing that was off about this movie is I expected it to have more death in it like Final Destination. With a title like 'A Million ways to die in the west' you have already witnessed all the like 5 death scenes if you watched the trailers.

I had hoped Hollywood had finally gotten over its obsession with bathroom humor--especially those embarassing fart jokes. But nope, watch even a few minutes of this mess and that offensive device is in full bloom. Seth McFarlane, who starred, directed, wrote and created this nightmarish flop seems to think we viewers are still back in the 80s where bathroom humor (i.e., check out ""Meet the Fockers"" as its ultimate potty-humor pinacle) caused frat boys and kids to roar with laughter, all the time looking at each other to see who could roar the loudest to show everybody that you ""got"" it.

Not easy on the eyes, annoying voice, everything is overacted. Gross and stupid. Seth makes you appreciate the actors even the ones you didn't think highly of. Charlize is beautiful and just eye candy. Her hair did better acting than Seth at any given moment. Kudos to the extras. Good job! Not worth watching this piece of self promotion of Seth.

It managed to use a simple love story and follow the story line of a lonely poor sheep herder. However, I feel that it did add up to what we would expect from Macfarlane. The entire film is one large set up for many smaller jokes. It is funny and entertaining but, it lacks an overall quality between camera set-ups and the audience. The same camera angle is used throughout a good 90% of the movie besides some close ups. The lighting is virtually blan and could have been improved.

It can be a crowd pleaser for those who wish to laugh at crude and sometimes queasy humor, although lacks many basic film qualities that most movies aim for. Many of the pleasing parts can actually be found in the trailer rendering the rest of the film hopeless.",1414540800,6,912,4.3023255813953485

There are movies out there that have some of that kind of humor like ""There's Something About Mary"", but they're done in an intelligent way that actually is very funny. This movie just made me cringe and feel like I needed to take a shower afterwards. All I kept thinking was how did they ever get people like Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, and Giovanni Ribisi to be in this movie. Didn't they read the script? Were they so desperate to be in a movie geared toward a younger crowd that they didn't listen to that little voice in their head that was screaming ""RUN!!!"". I always have one true test about whether a movie is good or not. If I'm embarrassed to tell anyone that I watched it, then I know it's pretty bad. The fact that I watched this movie, even in part, will go with me to my grave!",1414368000,7,1257,4.348936170212766

6370135,1,B00JKE4SVE,"Wish it was possible to give negative ratings. This pathetic waste of time never rises above being tawdry and disgusting. It's bad in so many ways it's impossible to describe them all without sinking to the same level. It couples the sensibilities of a badly confused, perverted twelve-year-old boy with the performance values of an alcoholic shock-jock. The sole redeeming feature  is the introductory footage of Monument Valley. Didn't know who MacFarlane was, and if I'd realized he was responsible for Family Guy, wouldn't have bothered watching, let alone paying to see it. Now that I do know who he is, will never view anything else he has anything to do with. The actors (MacFarlane can't act) should hang their heads in shame. Their SAG cards should be suspended until they each do three passable performances. How could Liam Neeson even consider being associated with such a travesty? (Although, a number of his recent roles do evoke memories of Dennis Weaver and Richard Crenna) The writers and director should be run out of town on rails. The executives who produced and released it should be fired. I'd like to think Christopher Lloyd didn't know his cameo would sully the Back to the Future Saga, but maybe he needed the money. The Django reference is appropriate, although that effort did at least have one or two redeeming features.

It only took about 15 mins of a 2 hour film to know it was definitely not worth watching. The ""funny"" dialog for me turned out to be just really crude and uncalled for.

Some of the situations and casual treatment of fatal accidents should limit it to a more mature audience, but it is certainly not your typical PG13 film.  The casting is superb with Seth MacFarlane doing a great job as the almost clueless hero,  Liam Neeson as the prototypical villain, and Charlize Theron capturing the screen whenever she is present.  The satirical send-up of a 1950's Western film is very successful.  This film has the feel of the other satirical Western classic, Blazing Saddles, but with a fresher, more contemporary film.  I could easily watch this film several times.  Highly Recommended.",1413936000,3,690,5.0

6370258,2,B00JKE4SVE,"Seth MacFarlane's ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is a good cultural touchstone, an example of Western cinematic artistry and humor in the early 21st century.  Like other dramas and parodies of our time, it couples high technical competence with idiotic and unrelentingly vulgar sensibilities.  It's hard to reconcile the beautiful vistas - most notably Monument Valley, Utah - with the ugliness of the script and dialogue.  It reflects a culture capable of recognizing and appreciating great cinematography while having absolutely nothing of value to say.

The film is an attempt at a contemporary ""Blazing Saddles,"" but is so gross and foul-mouthed that it makes Mel Brooks' earlier opus seem like a Noel Coward play in comparison.

There's also a discordance when seeing prominent actors appearing in such trashy roles.  We know now that Liam Neeson will appear in anything offering a fat check; this time, the film is so bad that his name is tucked in the credits sometime after the caterer.  Earlier in his career, Neeson put on various accents.  Here, he doesn't bother; he reverts to his Irish croak.  Neil Patrick Harris - whose career seems to be flying high - is required to pantomime an enormous attack of diarrhea; whatever he was paid, it wasn't enough.  And, miraculously, Charlize Theron is almost likeable here.

Once again, lovely vistas, fine costumes, a strong Western score and a prominent cast are brought together to tell a tale about diarrhea, urination in ones' face, bared male buttocks and penises, and non-stop vulgar language.  There's also constantly vicious Eastern condescension about the Old - and New - West.  Congratulations, MacFarlane; you're a real hero.

There were 3-4 really funny jokes but they were drowned out by a hundred jokes that fell flat and should have never made it out of the writers' room. Every bit of dialogue shamelessly put Seth MacFarlane at the center of attention, which is a missed opportunity given how funny Charlize Theron (cf. Arrested Development Season 3), Amanda Seyfried, and Neil Patrick Harris have been in other roles. Sarah Silverman plays the only character who gets enough breathing room to be funny without being smothered by MacFarlane's lines.

Wrong. Even if you can stomach his misplaced and odd character, the humor throughout is lazy and phoned in. Strictly for twelve year olds.",1413763200,,376,4.626865671641791
6370345,1,B00JKE4SVE,"The problem is not Seth MacFarlane, per se. The problem is what happens when a talented and funny guy like Seth is allowed to produce, direct, write, cast and star in a movie. With no one to listen to other than himself... and apparently believing that every idea and joke he had for this film were screen-worthy... his egomaniacal effort here proves it's possible to hurl tons of crap against a wall and have none of it stick. Including the crap jokes.

Honestly, I'd rather wear the hat that Neil Patrick Harris uses for a toilet in this movie than to sit through it again. It's two hours of your life that you're never going to get back again. And my one star rating is one star too many.

It's certainly not one that you're going to want to watch over and over, and it's not one that you're going to tell your friends that they HAVE to see, but it was worth the $5 to rent.

Positives: Nice cinematography, good cameo appearances, some funny jokes, hot female lead

Negatives: I think the biggest negative is that Seth never really makes you fall in love with his character. He's cynical, wimpy, and a little whiney. This all makes for good humor, but you never really understand why someone would risk their life to try and help him. Some jokes are dragged out a little - but if you know MacFarlane, you should know to expect this.",1413763200,4,845,4.48051948051948

Also, too many jokes where the ""punch line"" was a ""_-you!"".

Well, it's a lot of different kinds: there's historical and cultural references, there's crass humor, but it's not crass for it's own sake, it's Seth MacFarlane's kind of crass humor which means: it's done kind of to make fun of itself in the process. There's really quite a lot gems in this film, with the overall theme exactly as implied in the title: the Old West was a dangerous, filthy place where a lot could (and did) go wrong. Having grown up in the Southwest myself, I especially like the movie as it pokes fun of the stereotypes.

There is some really genius stuff here such as the ""different ways to die in the west"" speech and the ""nobody smiles in photos"" parody, but those awesome moments are few and far between. This movie really relies heavily on the relationship of MacFarlane & Theron and they're great together! This is mainly the reason for my higher than normal rating. I think most people will not like this movie, but I enjoyed it. There are some random gross out bits that if removed they wouldn't have been missed such as the semen on Silverman's face and the sheep penis near the end. Other gross-out bits such as the infamous diarrhea scene actually worked and NPH made that scene when he was reaching for hats.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it in the end and I intend to watch it again! The movie has its flaws: a slow start, too many unnecessary F-words, occasional gross humor, and overarching themes and character development that are predictable. What I did enjoy was the hilarious parody of Westerns and the fact that rather than romanticizing the wild west, the movie shows a true, albeit exaggerated, look at how crappy, uncertain, and depressing life was during those times. For me, the philosophical and cultural statements made by the protagonist were interesting and there were some truly hilarious parts in the film. It wasn't a Blazing-Saddles-level experience, but still enjoyable comedy. For comparison, I would say that overall ""Ted"" was a better movie, both in humor and in pacing.

Charlize Theron and Seth Meyers? I didn't think so at first, but was amazed at what a great choice the pairing was. I not only believed it, but rooted for them. The scenery was great, the characters great, the shock value was great and it all ended in a very redeeming conclusion, worthy of the old westerns.

We still chuckle at the thought about some of the depictions. By gutter humor I will give readers an example. We were in Italy with four friends a few years ago. We were eating in a restaurant in a lower level room. The view out of the windows showed that we were about 4 feet below ground level. A wandering Italian accordionist walked up to our building and proceeded to urinate on the windows. When finished, he removed his Tam, Cocked cap or whatever one calls them, and gave the guests eating at the level a deep bow with his cap off, to which he received applause from some in the restaurant.

6370650,5,B00JKE4SVE,"I think the people who didn't like this movie don't like Seth MacFarlane. The thing is, he does excellent work and A Million Ways to Die in the West is one of them. A hilarious cast makes this one funny film, yet, as is common with MacFarlane's shows and films, there is some sweet, heartfelt moments midst the poop and fart jokes.  Yeah, the jokes can sometimes approach the line and then cartwheel over it, but fans of MacFarlane have come to expect that.

As for the film's quality? This is a gorgeous movie.  Beautiful landscape shots make this one to own on bluray for sure.  The score is fantastic, calling back to many western themes that came before it, but bringing it's own quality at the same time. I don't care what anyone says, MacFarlane makes a great leading man. Charlize Theron is... well, I mean, she's Charlize freaking Theron, so she's amazing, of course!  Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, Liam Neeson and Giovanni Ribisi all contribute mighty performances in supporting roles. And don't get me started on all the cameos, especially the unnecessary but wonderful throwback to... you know, what, I'm not going to spoil it.  Just know that there is a really great throwback to another movie.

Bottom line, if you like Seth MacFarlane and get his humor, you'll enjoy the flick.  You know who you are.  If, like my parents, you hated Ted (Seriously, Mom, I could have told you you wouldn't like it!) then MacFarlane's follow-up probably won't win you over, but if you skip this, you'll be missing out.",1412899200,,1522,4.713207547169811

6370685,4,B00JKE4SVE,"Seth MacFarlane is Albert, a cowardly sheep farmer (""I'm the guy in the crowd making fun of the hero's shirt"") living on the frontier.  He's grown to hate his life; after all, there's a million ways to die out there.  The only good thing he has going is Louise, until she gets fed up with his cowardice and starts shacking up with a wealthier, more-mustachioed gentleman.  With nothing left to hold him in Ol' Stump, Albert's about to head to San Francisco...until he meets the beautiful, quick-witted Anna, who promises to help him make Louise jealous and get her back.  Except Anna has a little secret: she's married to the deadliest gunfighter in the territory, and he's on his way to town.

I can see how A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST isn't for everyone; it's a bit over the top in spots, much like MacFarlane's FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD have been in recent seasons.  (Fortunately, however, these moments are brief.)  And the film drags in spots, surprisingly.  It's so funny when it's on, that during the more serious moments, time seems to drag.

Still, MILLION WAYS is absolutely worth your time if you're at all a fan of MacFarlane's, or if you love hard-R comedies that actually have some intelligence behind them.  The film is not only hilarious; it looks and feels like a western, much the same way BLAZING SADDLES did. I'm not really comparing the two films; MacFarlane and company didn't set out to make another masterpiece, they just wanted to have a little fun.  And they did.  Solid acting from all involved, quick-witted jokes and some nice slapstick, and beautiful cinematography help carry the film.  In case you're wondering: MacFarlane's wit helps carry him; he probably couldn't do someone else's comedy, but he's the master of his own.  And he's surrounded himself with a cast (Liam Neeson, Neil Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfried, Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, and Giovanni Ribisi prime among them) that's on the same page he is.  (Also look for the cameos.  And for some, you'll definitely have to look.)  Is this a new classic?  Nope.

The supporting cast pretty much does the same thing with the exception of Charlize Theron who seems completely at home on the range. There are some fun facts about the old wild west and just how dangerous it was. I thought there was a gold mine of material here but it just doesn't gel. Sarah Silverman tries too hard to be the Christian saloon girl  engaged to Giovanni Ribisi who can't leave her work out of their relationship. Neil Patrick Harris vamps the hell out of his role as the mustache baron who takes McFarlands first love, Amanda Seyfried, away from him because, well, he's just too weird and boring. Liam Neeson is a pretty good bad guy, but he doesn't have much screen time. Seth and Charliez have a few, very few, funny scenes.

When his girlfriend dumps him for a man with a mustache after he chickens out during a gunfight he decides its time to leave town. When a mysterious woman named Anna (Theron) shows up she convinces him to stay and teaches him to shoot in order to win back the woman he loves. Things are going great until the secret Anna has been hiding shows up. I have to start by saying I love anything MacFarlane does. Family Guy is hilarious and Ted was great. I even thought he was a great Oscar host. All that being said I had pretty high expectations for this movie. The problem with most comedies is that they show all of the funny parts in the previews. This movie is an exception, mainly because most of the movie they can't show on TV. I laughed all the way through and there were some great cameos in this. The humor is very MacFarlane so if you aren't a fan of his you probably won't find this that funny. Even with my high expectations I still really liked this and laughed a lot. If I had to say anything bad about this it would be that I thought Ted was a little funnier but that's about it. Overall, a very funny movie that MacFarlane fans will love. If you don't offend easy and love to laugh I highly recommend this. I give it a high B+.",1412467200,,1400,4.227611940298507

I had decided to ignore my initial misgivings thinking that perhaps this movie would be one of those gems that is buried because it seems like a horrible idea. Neil Patrick Harris is usually hilarious, and Seth Mcfarlane is quite popular. Liam Neeson tends to be at least interesting to watch, and Sarah Silverman can be funny.

Obviously the film has swearing in it, as would have been quite frequent back in those times. The film does however keep a light sort of feel to it, as opposed to say Hell on Wheels or something. I was reminded of Back to the Future III as this film went along, long before Christopher Lloyd has a brief cameo near the end. In fact part of the enjoyment of this film are the numerous couple of second cameos by a number of major stars. I'll let you be surprised by who they are and won't mention them.

All the main actors do a good job but I would have liked to have seen Amanda Seyfried have a bit more dialogue and meatier a role. She's pretty much just a character either Seth or Neil Patrick Harris bump their lines or physical comedy acts off as she stands there. I think she was a bit underutilised.

Ok, she doesn't tell Albert she's married and her husband is an outlaw, (Liam Neeson) so there are a few hitches in this love affair.

The is movie is shot amist the crisp, clear backdrop of Utah with it's panoramic lanscape and eye-catching skies. I wish people could look past the jokes and see the story underneath the comedy. MacFarlane has proven that he can make the transition from Family Guy voice actor/writer to the big screen. But it wouldn't be a Seth MacFarlane movie without poop gags and sexual undertones, not to mention the classic, ""Mustache"" song. It's a look at old Westerns like, ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" viewed with the modern-day sensabilities of phobias and drug references.

6370900,2,B00JKE4SVE,"A Million Ways to Die in the West
 I often say that it is difficult to make a good movie and that we should reward good movies by our support at the box office.  A Million Ways to Die is proof of that proposition.  Seth MacFarlane should have tried harder to make a good movie instead of a stupid gross out film.  MacFarlane and his two co-writers all three wrote the less stupid and somewhat less gross but ultimately appealing Ted a few years ago.  Ted is both warmer and funnier.
 A few of the bits in A Million Ways to Die in the West work well.  There is a peyote dream sequence that comes across very well.  Wes Studi, a Native American actor who you will recognize, plays Cochise who captures the Seth MacFarlane character and hosts a bout of hallucinogenic imbibing.
 The set up of the movie is a fish out of water in the old west.  In the Arizona territory in 1882 a sheep herder (played by MacFarlane), cowardly, feckless and irritated by his very presence on the frontier, has a hard time coping with life.  He hates the west and fears it.  Somehow he attracts the attention of the local schoolmarm, Amanda Seyfried-- for a while.  She rightly throws him over for a better man, the local mustache-grooming shop owner.  The proprietor of the mustachery is Neal Partick Harris who we remember from his role as the teen genius physician Doogie Howser.
 Meanwhile, the wife of the local bad man (convincingly played by Liam Neeson) comes to the dusty Arizona town and takes pity on the sheep man.  Charlize Theron is married to Clinch Leatherwood, the aptly named gunslinger.  In Ted the peppy and pretty Mila Kunis unbelievably falls for a loser with a talking teddy bear.  In A Million Ways to Die in the West the gorgeous Charlize Theron unbelievably falls for the cowardly sheep man.  When MacFarlane, Salkin and Wild write a film script they do not let believability enter into things.  That would be ok if the jokes worked, which they mostly do not here.  A comedy should be funny above all else.  This one isnt, at least it isn't funny enough and funny consistently enough to satisfy.
 Giovanni Robisy is a veteran of Ted who returns in a supporting role in A Million Ways to Die in the West.  He is teamed with Sarah Silverman.  MacFarlane must have a lot of friends in the industry.  Many of them pop into the film at odd moments in cameo shots, several with no speaking parts at all.  It is fun to see the likes of Christopher Lloyd, Bill Maher, Jamie Foxx, Gilbert Gottried and Ryan Reynolds flash briefly on the screen.  We have a cameo voice experience from Patrick Stewart as the voice of a sheep.
 With all that talent we could hope for a better outcome.  MacFarlane plays the cowardly sheep man with the style and attitude of a contemporary Hollywood hipster but it doesnt really suit the setting very well.  Charlize Theron however is wonderful whenever she is on screen.  Only Neeson has the star power to share a scene with her.
 Country music star Alan Jackson performs the theme song and Joel McNeely wrote the heroic western style theme music.  Cinematographer Michael Barrett blesses us with ravishing vistas of the West that delight the eye and surely deserve to be in a better movie.
 A tiny two saw blades for the R for raunchy not so comic A Million Ways to Die in the West.  It runs just short of two hours at 116 minutes.  On a budget of $40 million it took $16.4 million in ticket sales worldwide over the three day opening.  Besides writing, directing and starring MacFarlane also produced this film.  Ted made him wonderfully rich.  This one will not do much for his cash hoard, or his reputation for that matter.
 In fairness to MacFarlane, he seems like a nice person.  He dated Emilia Clarke who plays Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones.  His is worth $150 million which is a very nice sum and his jazz record hit number 2 on the jazz charts.  But A Million Ways to Die in the West misses the mark, widely.",1409443200,,3951,4.49648382559775

6370906,3,B00JKE4SVE,"Reminiscent of an 80's raunchy comedy, similar to movies like Police Academy and Porky's  This isn't a good thing.  While movies like Porky's made way for modern comedy's like American Pie, this movie is more like the predecessors in the 80s than the modern raunchy comedy's like 40 Year Old Virgin, and the Hangover.  Simply, the jokes are poorly timed and the script seems to be written to facilitate Seth McFarlane's jokes. The plot's only purpose seems be a set up for MacFarlane's jokes.  To MacFarlane's credit, he does hit every joke out of the park, but his constant whiny humor is sadly not enough for him to carry the movie by himself to which it seems is the intent.  In fact, McFarlane's brand of humor and delivery is almost exact to Vince Vaughn's own brand of humor.  I could easily see Vaughn staring in this movie as easily as MacFarlane.

Like Vaughn, MacFarlane is no leading man.  Of course, again like Vaughn, MacFarlane would make an extraordinary Funnyman next to a Straightman much like he was in his last movie Ted.  Unfortunately, this movie has no Straightman for MacFarlane to bounce his jokes off of.  He is pretty much talking to to the audience the whole movie.  The closest we get is our villain and Charlize Theron who spends most of her parts setting the comedy ball on a tee, than actually pitching.

Sarah Silverman and Giovani Ribisi are an amazing comedy dual using the Double Act formula missing from McFarlane, but they seem to be limited to one running gag, and appear sporadically throughout the film with no real purpose for being present in the scene.  Similarly, Alex Borstein also makes a brief appearance, and delivers again comedy gold, but is sadly absent from the rest of the movie.

Neil Patrick Harris delivers a decent performance, but his entire character in the movie is limited to rehashing the same character and tired jokes from How I Met Your Mother.  Naturally he plays the selfish bully who steals McFarlanes girlfriend, but other than a source or torment for our main character, really serves no purpose to the plot.  Harris's only comedic contributions to the plot are a dance and song, that was meant to be a jab at McFarlane, but felt more like pettiness (It was about McFarlane's lack of a Mustache) and a poop joke.

Amanda Seyfried has an almost insignificant part in the movie who's main function seems to be stand behind someone else and look pretty.  This is shame because there are some musical parts in this movie, which Seyfried would be adapt at performing.  (remember Mama Mia?)  She seriously needed more to do in this movie.

Overall the plot was flimsy.  Its to most noticeable plotholes are:

1.  When Theron knocks out her abusive husband who is on his way to kill MacFarlane, instead of killing or wounding him, she instead plants a flower in his butt and runs to warn MacFarlane.

2.  At the end of the movie McFarlane is left to duel Liam Nielson (our outlaw villain), with little training.  Of course our hero musters the courage and wins the day, but up until this point we have learned that Theron is an amazing shot, far exceeding Nielson's talent.  This begs the question, why didn't Theron's character kill the outlaws.  As demonstrated earlier in the movie, her skills in sharpshooting are on X-Man levels, it would have been easy for her to dispatch the whole gang.  Strangely though, instead of fighting, she spends the end sequence of the movie running from the gang.

Overall, this was a weakly plotted movie that is more setup for Seth McFarlane than storytelling.  McFarlane lacks a straightman to help his jokes land, and the talents of other comedians in this movie are sadly wasted.

Regardless, this isn't an entirely bad movie.  It the sort of movie that bad enough to be good.  It reminds me of Freddy Got Fingered which actually drove me out of the theater, but got better on progressive viewings. I give this movie 3 stars because it may not be good, but I will probably watch again.  The opening scene was particularly entertaining as well as his rant about death in the west.

6370908,4,B00JKE4SVE,"Blazing Saddles? No. Not nearly as clever or subtle. But that's not to say this farce wasn't enjoyable; because I had a great time watching, and perhaps more importantly, listening to MacFarlane's gutter-strewn, barbed-edged comedy.

The most interesting aspect: I'm not a fan of anything Seth has done. Most of that is disconnect, not dislike; I just don't happen to watch his programming. Explaining why I enjoyed this so much. Because I'm not familiar with the man's work to have a predisposition or expectation - nor was I automatically disinclined to avoid it. Making for an odd, but unbiased, position to review this film.

As Albert Stark, he portrayed the frustrated and insightful outlier to the brutal times and context which he found himself - Western America in the late 1880s. The eponymous titled ""Million Ways To Die"" became fodder for his hilarious pronouncements, in particular the unceasing and twisted means by which regular folk meet the Grim Reaper. Don't ask what happens at the town's Annual Fair.

By placing the lead character in the role of the infamous western sheep farmer* - MacFarlane did a wonderful job of reworking the classic tale seen in proper westerns like ""The Big Country"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""; albeit with a terrifically skewed modernist take on everything from language to social intercourse.

Ha ha - got one in myself. :-D

I wonder if this would've worked better as a time-traveler type flick?

The previous sentence may sound like I'm referring to the many hilarious cameos (had no idea he had so many famous friends) But in fact, not realizing what was about to happen, I wrote that as a note in the middle of screening the film. Those cameos were hilarious!

Okay.

So.

Clearly, those offended by base scatological and so-called filthy humor should avoid this at all cost. And to those whose upbringing allowed freedom of expression and profane, but witty, sarcasm - you might just find this a fun one-time ride.

It's definitely not a movie you have to see in theaters.  Honestly, I'll enjoy it far more sitting on my couch rewatching it 100 times.  The acting is all top notch and the little Easter Egg with Doc Brown makes it THAT much more awesome!  Liam Neeson really is a brilliant actor.  He can go from tough ""good"" guy (Taken) to tough ""bad"" guy with the snap of a finger.  Add him with Charlize Theron's looks and Seth MacFarlane's humor and you can't get much better, IMO.

I'm not going to delve into the story too much.

He quickly realizes his mistake but luckily meets Anna (Charlize Theron).  They become friends and she agrees to teach him how to be a gunfighter.

6370920,5,B00JKE4SVE,"There is too much misguided criticism of this movie. It is a comedy that is funny, from a mind that is outstanding with delivery. Seth McFarlane's humour is crude, and unconventional, but that's what makes it great. The key to comedy is surprise, and unlike most of the other comedies out there, it's hard to see his jokes coming. His humour is his own making, so there are not imitations. Most comedies are formulaic, and McFarlane hasn't followed a path that allows that. He's making it up as he goes, so it's almost always new.

Family guy was his effort to take gags from popular media, and deliver them better. TED was his effort to take his well earned success, and make something original. This is his effort to freshen up western comedy.

It doesn't matter whether or not you like his humour. This movie is original, and well done. Top shelf actors are just about all there is in the cast, and some of them are disposable characters. That only works, because the best in the industry recognize that McFarlane is head and shoulders better than the competition, in that he knows who to hire, and can handle the work alone. As a director, he's fun to work with, and that gets the best from his actors. The fact that the most famous actors there are will take any role he gives them is enough to convince all but the most blinded consumer that his work is worth noting.

Most noteworthy of all, is that he is the only one willing to write a SAG movie. That's why Hollywood movies have gotten so cliche lately. All of the good writers refuse to work on SAG movies anymore. This movie deserves praise, simply by being original. Then there is all of the other qualities.",1404345600,,1671,4.490131578947368

6370926,3,B00JKE4SVE,"Seth MacFarlane, whose infamous Family Guy is an affair of jokes that sometimes hit a perfect note, but the jokes of which are really all over the place. His 2012 feature debut Ted shocked me because it was good - like an above-average really good comedy. While some directors and writers have an ability to top themselves every outing, Im sorry to say MacFarlane is not one of those people.

""A Million Ways to Die In the West"" is an updated re-telling of ""Blazing Saddles"" basically, which seems like a perfect fit for MacFarlane. I think the script simply needed another draft.

MacFarlane plays Albert, recently dumped by his girlfriend (a tragically underused Amanda Seyfried) who goes on a quest with Anna (a good Charlize Theron,) a mysterious new woman in town who is full of secrets, but seems pretty cool generally, to win back his girlfriend and prove his own worth.

MacFarlane, as an actor, does well enough here, but he shouldnt attempt to do any more acting parts that are even vaguely more serious than this film. He doesnt nail the serious moments, but the audience goes along with it for the most part. Theron is great in comedies, as evidenced in Young Adult, and she has lots of fun here.

Supporting characters played by Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman are quite funny as well. Neil Patrick Harris and Liam Neeson round out the cast as the surprisingly not miscast villains. MacFarlane, as a director, made the wise choice to give the supporting people enough room to make their own characters, which is a good thing.

However, the film itself isn't quite the riot it should be. Its sporadically very very funny, but some jokes are duds while others are home runs. If I had to speak generally, I would say more of the jokes work than not, but MacFarlane has an affinity for fart jokes, which get really old after awhile. A Million Ways To Die In The West has some golden moments in it - including a hilarious musical number and a grand hallucination scene. If only it were a bit more consistent, it would have been something of a little classic.

6370928,3,B00JKE4SVE,"What I like about A Million Ways to Die in the West is that as a Western it actually looks really good and is well shot. As a comedy though it drags on way too long. And speaking of dragging on, the jokes that are funny drag on too long as well. While Seth MacFarlane is okay as the lead, he doesn't seem 100% comfortable on camera yet to be a leading man. Still, he sort of pulls off a Woody Allen in a Western kind of role. While the film is stronger when he is on screen with Charlize Theron.
  Everyone else kind of has one dimensional roles. Neil Patrick Harris is probably only in the film since he gets to dance in one scene. And when he isn't doing that is talking about his mustache. When he's not doing that.
....he has a dragged out potty humor scene.
  While Sarah Silverman plays a whore ""sorry think that's what hookers were called back then lol"" who won't sleep with her b/f (Giivanni Ribisi) due to her religion and saving herself for marriage. Meanwhile she has sex with over 10 guys a day. That is funny but would be funnier if it didn't drag on through most movie. Spoiler: but when the film is half way over she of course out of nowhere agrees to have sex with him with no good reason given.
  So pretty much MacFarlane and Theron are the only ones who have character build-up. Since MacFarlane has to learn not to be a coward. And Theron learns there's a better man out their than the vicious outlaw she was with since she 9. Who is played by the badass Liam Nieson. Nieson is good as the villain but I guess you can say his character is one dimensional too. But when does a villain in a Western ever want to do more than drawer or kill innocents anyway ?

A film comedy should be evaluated mostly for how many times you laugh, or at least smile uncontrollably.  In this over-long feature film by Seth MacFarlane, I found the jokes sometimes hilarious and other times, death bombs.  In addition to directing, MacFarlane co-wrote the screenplay and stars as Albert, a rather meekly mannered sheep rancher.  Early in the film, Albert's girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him for the more manly and mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris).  Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into town and strikes up a friendly relationship with Albert.  What Albert doesn't know is that Anna is in a bad marriage with the meanest hombre around, Clinch (Liam Neeson).

Supporting the film are Sarah Silverman as Ruth, a prostitute who is engaged to Edward (Giovanni Ribisi), a virgin.  He's OK with Ruth's job (servicing 10-15 men per day) but wants to wait until they are married to do the nasty.  One of the better scenes, and not shown in the trailers, involves Albert's meeting with Cochise (Wes Studi) and his tribe.  Maybe not of the same caliber as the ""Blazing Saddles"" campfire scene but darn close.  My biggest complaint deals with the excessive use of toilet humor and one scene in particular is hurl-worthy.  Grow up Seth.  Still, overall, the film is funny, has some outstanding photography (Monument Valley) and is generally well acted with Ms. Theron a standout.",1402358400,15,1422,5.077586206896552

Yes, I can see how some professional reviewers from major publications would try to downplay their enjoyment of this film, because they may consider themselves to be too ""high-brow"" to have been entertained by the likes of the jokes that went far above-and-beyond the common call of morality...there are a few that I didn't like, but I'm not about to condemn the whole movie because every SINGLE joke wasn't the best! Overall, I still got more than my fair share's worth of enjoyment out of the film. It's NOT appropriate for small children, yes, but it CLEARLY wasn't made with children in mind!

6370933,4,B00JKE4SVE,"""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" shovels jokes, sight gags, riffs on old Westerns, and crude humor as fast as it can, figuring everything will be funny to someone in the audience.  It's a good bet, and this Western comedy works, although the humor is all over the map, not PC, and sometimes pretty gross.  This reviewer saw the movie with an audience that laughed out loud at some of the jokes and sight gags, and groaned at some of the cruder humor.

Seth MacFarlane stars as sheep farmer Albert Starks, a nice guy who hates the old West and who as the movie opens gets dumped by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) after he chickens out of a gun fight.  Louise takes up with the insufferable Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) who runs the local moustachery.  The lonely Albert runs into Anna (Charlize Theron), the runaway wife of mean gunfighter Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), who takes him under her wing and trains him to fight the inevitable duels, first against Foy and then against Clinch.

The opening segments of the movie feature a lot of modern breakup humor, nicely done by Albert and his best friends Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Ruth (an hilarious Sarah Silverman as a prostitute).  The movie really picks up steam as it drops into a more traditional western storyline, complete with barn dances, gunfights, barroom brawls, Indians, chases on horseback, and a predictable but enjoyable romance.  There are a ton of cameos and the magnificent scenery is right out of a John Ford Western. Recommended as good entertainment.",1402185600,94,1538,4.799242424242424
6370934,5,B00JKE4SVE,"Director, Writer, Producer and Star  Seth McFarlane (Family Guy, Ted) has done an amazingly hysterical job of recreating, for modern times, a Mel Brooksish style film containing farce humor in this nonstop adult comedy. I haven't laughed this hard out loud for a long time and A Million Ways To Die In The Old West was literally one laugh, shock or surprise after another.

This is definitely an adult orientated film do to the language, sexual references, poopy humor and lots of inferred innuendos that you really need to pay attention because you could miss some very funny stuff. Seth McFarlane does a wonderful job of staging and coordinating both the visual and verbal jokes throughout the film with a wonderful cast playing everything as real and as straight forward as they can. (The outtakes on this film must be amazing!)

Its the story of a sheep farmer (yes, there are tons of very funny sheep jokes, sight gags and references), who is Seth, who is dating a not-so-nice girl played by Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, Les Miserable) and then in the process of trying to propose to her, she dumps him.

Enter an unhappy and unfulfilled wife of a villain who happens to be a very kind soul and wonderful sharp shooter herself, Charlize Theron (Monster, Prometheus) who learns who and what Seths character is all about. They have a nice genuine friendship that grows into something more by the end of the film and the resulting circumstances are so much fun to watch.

Enter the husband of Charlize who is the territorys most notorious and deadly killer played by Liam Neeson (Schindlers List, Taken). Liams humor comes from the real evil nature he portrays as the villain. You really end up disliking who he is with some very funny scenes that he is put in.

Then there is the always funny and quick-witted Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, The Smurfs) who plays the hysterical mustache twirling, cocky attitude wielding, mustache grooming shop owner who wrongfully swoons Amandas character over to his whims. Neil plays comedy so well that just his looks, gleam in his eye or a wildly crazy pratfall  because he was just given a super laxative - will figuratively keep you in stitches.

Special note and bow to the wonderful performances of Sarah Silverman (There Something About Mary, Wreck-It Ralph) playing a prostitute who is always working and her boyfriend played by Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Ted) who is a softer, quieter Christian of man about to propose to her too. Now, the both agree not to have sex with each other until after they are married. (Boing!) They have too many funny scenes to describe, but they have some great chemistry on screen and there are always jokes within jokes with these two characters.

With such an amazing score by Joel McNeely (American Dad, Flipper), some very surprising and funny cameos by Patrick Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lloyd and Gilbert Gottfried (all good friends with Seth because of Family Guy) along with some of the cleverest special effects built around some very funny sight gags, A Million Ways To Die In The Old West was a very funny movie for adults and older teens  definitely not a kids film.

6370936,5,B00JKE4SVE,"Blazing Saddles for the Family Guy generation?... maybe. Mel Brooks himself admits that you couldn't make that film today but Seth's sensibilities are sufficiently irreverent at least, and it's got  a musical number (a must for any MacFarlane project). I should begin by saying if you liked MacFarlane's directorial debut via ""Ted"" then you'll love ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" or as the kids are calling it ""AMWTDITW."" This time you get to see Seth as well as here him and he's taken over as leading man, a pacifist sheep herder Albert but a leading man nonetheless. The rest of the cast is just as fun Amanda Seyfried is the ex-girlfriend Albert is trying to win back with the help of Charlize Theron as outlaw's wife Anna and her distracting wig. Neil Patrick Harris and Sarah Silverman are a hysterical supporting cast and Liam Neeson is flippin' perfect as the gunslinging antagonist  and Anna's husband. Some amazing celeb cameos include: Ryan Reynolds, Patrick Stewart,  Jamie Fox, Ewan McGregor, Gilbert Gottfried, Christopher Lloyd, Alex Borstein (a.k.a. Lois Griffin)... but some you'll miss if you blink or leave before the credits roll. Sadly Mila Kunis only appears in the dialogue.  Most of the humor is knowing anachronistic shots at how awful western life is and the rest is some delightfully filthy material including some sight gags that push the limits of the ""R"" rating, but no nak'ed folk though pard'ners, unless you count sheep junk.",1402012800,4,1463,4.934959349593496
6370937,5,B00JKE4SVE,"People have been saying that Seth MacFarlane should have stayed behind the camera and hired someone else to play Albert Stark but one of the things that makes this film work is the approach of putting a ""modern man"" in the Old West and going from there. Sarah Silverman and Neil Patrick Harris are also great in supporting roles. It is not going to be everyone's brand of humor but if you like the Family Guy then you will have a fun time here. Don't take it seriously or compare it to Blazing Saddles and you won't be disappointed.",1402012800,4,532,4.383838383838384
6370938,5,B00JKE4SVE,"Some haterade going around - but view with confidence; Seth Macfarlane and crew are dialed in and rock-solid in this screwball western.  Sarah Silverman is priceless as Ruth, the hooker with a heart of gold. Liam Neeson as the sociopathic gang leader plays it deadly straight and  Macfarlanes' character, our protagonist  seems at risk for real.  Connecting the foils is Charlize  Theron, strong as one could hope for as a dramatic and comedic slugger.
A terrific cast, score, and set make this a high-budget comedy that will pay off. If you like ""Family Guy"" you will love this flick... if you can't stand that show, give this a pass.  But ignore the critics who claim Blazing Saddles was 10 times better; that was slapsick, and so is this. There is good reason 2 A-listers volunteered for this frontier trek. There are brassy, bawdy, and genuinely witty moments throughout the film - the good time don't just end at the trailer.  * ( I went with 2 men and 2 women- everyone enjoyed it) *",1401840000,100,989,4.649425287356322

MacFarlane plays a dorky sheep farmer named Albert Stark, who is dumped by his girlfriend because he wimped out during a gun battle. Soon enters Clinch Leatherwood, the toughest outlaw in the west, played by Liam Neeson, who wants to kill Albert for fooling around with his wife, Anna. Anna slowly befriends Albert and tries to teach him how to shoot a gun. There are tons of racist and politically incorrect jokes.

I was really looking forward to what looked like a tongue-in-cheek, fresh new spoof at old-fashioned Western life. However, from the time the movie started, I didn't laugh once. Seth MacFarlane's attempt at something witty fell fabulously short- the humor was infantile, unimaginative, and repetitive. The few attempts at something besides low-level comedy- drama, maybe that's what it was- completely missed the mark as well. His character came across as someone completely whiny and unlikeable, and Neil Patrick Harris seemed to be reprising the role of Barney in How I Met Your Mother. Neither Amanda Seyfried nor Charlize Theron seemed to be anything other than stereotypical female tropes.

I will admit however that there were a few times where I felt that the pacing of the movie could have been better.  And I will also stipulate that Ted was the greater of these two comedies by far.  But that shouldn't discourage any Seth MacFarlane fan from seeing or enjoying this film.  If crude content such as drugs, language, sex, etc. is not for you, then I would advise against seeing this movie.",1401580800,5,557,4.475247524752476
6370945,3,B00JKE4SVE,"The talent of Seth MacFarlane is undeniable, and to call him anything less than a modern comedy marvel would be insulting.  His notable creations include the popular primetime animated comedy, Family Guy, along with the Family Guy spin-off, The Cleveland Show.  The success of Family Guy alone has propelled MacFarlanes career, culminating in hosting duties of the Academy Awards, a feature film, Ted, and even a jazz album, titled Music is Better than Words.  Now, his latest creation, A Million Ways to Die in the West, has him challenging gun-fighters, raising sheep, and basically loathing anything and everything associated with the old west.

Seth MacFarlane directs, writes (along with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild), and stars in A Million Ways to Die in the West as a cowardly sheep farmer, Albert Stark.  Upon first meeting Albert, its clear he has a way with words  talking himself out of a gunfight hes obviously unable to win (since hes never fired a gun in his life).  His girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried), also takes issue with Alberts cowardly demeanor, and after a year and a half relationship, dumps him.  Emotionally distraught, he turns to his friends, Edward (Giovanni), and his promiscuous girlfriend, Ruth (Sarah Silverman), for comfort.

At the same time, the infamous outlaw, Clinch Leatherwood (Charlize Theron), is up to no good  and instructs his heavily irritated and defiant wife, Anna (Charlize Theron), to wait for him in the small Arizona town that Albert cant wait to leave.  After a bar brawl, Anna and Albert meet, and eventually run into Louise and her new boyfriend, Foy (Neil Patrick Harris)  at which point Albert challenges him to a gun duel.  Lucky for Albert, Anna is quite skilled with a gun and takes to teaching him, while surprisingly falling for him.  Unfortunately, Albert knows little about her past or the gigantic problem that will arise when her husband returns.

In typical MacFarlane fashion, this film quickly sets a gutter tone, and does not shy away from vulgar language, sexual banter, or racist stereotypes.  A substantial amount of violence is noticeably present, too.  Like the movie title says, theres a million ways to die in the west  and over the course of the two-hour flick, death is a rather frequent occurrence.  Death comes in the form of a giant ice block, a rambunctious bull, getting a picture taken, and the obvious use of gunplay.  Still, theres nothing here thats overly interesting or that stands out as a moment that definitively makes the film.

Coming as no surprise, the cast is rightfully pleasing and entertaining.  Seth MacFarlane, who dominates the screen time, is not your typical leading actor, but he has endless dramatic potential should he choose to embrace it  and his most mesmerizing scenes come at the least suspecting moments.  In one particular scene, hell be attempting to outrun angry outlaws, and the next hell be in a drug induced haze full of music, animation  all randomly concluding with an unsuspecting (and hilarious) version of Abraham Lincoln giving a speech.  No, you really cant dream up this kind of spontaneity and absurdity.

The supporting cast, including Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, and especially Neil Patrick Harris, help mold this flick into a tolerable, yet rocky adventure.  Astonishingly, the chemistry between the characters is well received  including a barb-filled rivalry between MacFarlane and Neil Patrick Harris.  As you might suspect, Patrick Harris has just as much entertainment potential as MacFarlane and they compliment each other nicely, especially in the films musical number (taking place during a barn dance), which is best referred to as the mustache interaction.

Unfortunately, for all the ingenious ideas that come from MacFarlanes mind, you also have to swallow the tasteless misses, as well.  In this case, there is a multitude of jokes that simply fail to muster any sort of desired reaction (and after some jokes, you can hear crickets).  You could certainly say this film is one big joke about sheep farmers, which never completely resonates from the get-go.  Plus, theres a barrage of Indian remarks that never feel appropriate, and then another scene where white people are shooting black figurines at a carnival. Obviously, MacFarlane thrives on being controversial with his imagination, but there are just certain moments within this film that simply cross the line far too much to ignore.

Overall, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a completely clichd comedy that pays homage to old western films, while at the same time, incorporating Seth MacFarlanes unique sense of unfiltered humor and imagination.  Still, its nearly impossible to recommend a film of this nature, since its full of needless vulgarity, not to mention overly offensive displays of bigotry, and borderline embarrassing interpretations of the way people lived in the mid 19th century.  Regardless, for those wondering, there are plenty of clever jokes, meaning if you're a fan of MacFarlane, youll want to waste little time in seeing this film.  For everyone else, though, be forewarned of this brand of shameful humor  as this wouldnt be the first time, nor will it be the last, that someone sat down to watch a MacFarlane production and either walked out of it offended, or simply refused to see it through to its conclusion.

6370946,4,B00JKE4SVE,"Although I think Seth McFarlane quite talented, I am not a follower nor am I inclined to compare this apple to the orange named Ted.  I am far more a follower of Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron, and even Amanda Seyfried who make up the ensemble in this movie.

We have seen many attempts at comedy westerns before and they can be hit or miss affairs.  Anyone remember Wild Wild West?  Me neither.  I loved Three Amigos though with its silly parody of The Magnificent Seven and  Tarantino's Django Unchained.

This however is a worthy effort by MacFarlane who ably plays the main character Albert and is ably supported by Amanda Seyfried, and Neil Patrick Harris,  Giovanni Ribisi, and that great method actress Sarah Silverman who plays his prostitute girlfriend.  I think she has been preparing for this role all her life.

My takeaway from this movie may be different than yours.  For me, cowboys represent the ultra masculine, and Albert a humble shepherd, is masculine but not manly, and shrinks from confrontation.  His girlfriend Louise, disappointed in how he shirks a fight, even though he successfully gets a nonviolent solution, this excites not her female regions, and she breaks up with him.

Pretty soon, perhaps too soon, she starts dating a mustachioed lothario played by Neil Patrick Harris, whose comedic skills are effortlessly brilliant.

Meanwhile, a beautiful stranger (Charlize Theron) with a dark past rides into town, and Albert's best friend dates a prostitute with whom sex is off the table, an interesting dichotomy which sets up some amusing scenes. Liam Neeson plays a mean gunslinger. The movie is quite funny in places, full of sight gags and running jokes.  Much of the humor is unsophisticated, by the  numbers scatological references for example but there are some really good bits, and some people in the audience were laughing throughout the movie.  I particularly loved a shamanic dream sequence which was visually imaginative and quite funny.  And one gunfight scene involving Neil Patrick Harris and a cowboy hat was quite amusing.

Our beautiful stranger helps our hero find his manhood, and you might think as a woman she might also feel the same way about the lacking masculinity, but she has had too much manhood, and needs a break, a lifestyle change with a decent man, although she does have certain skills which help Albert to man up, so for Albert there is a metamorphosis but if you're like me you sense that her dark past will create complications, because there are a million ways to die in the west, and another one can ride into town at any minute.

The audience liked this movie a lot and gave it a decent round of applause at the end.  I think most people will like the  movie.  What I liked best perhaps was Charlize Theron's performance, she simply has a great presence, and I loved the comment about Louise's eyes.

What I liked about MacFarlane's performance was that he was true to the good nature of his character.  It must have been so tempting to go on a comedic rampage, and overstep the boundaries of the character, but he managed to rein it in and craft a relatable and likable underdog that we root for.  I probably won't run out to see the next  Seth MacFarlane movie but I may amble at a brisk pace.  I hope this was helpful.",1401580800,6,3293,4.739894551845342
