1256659,4,B000031EGU,For the year it was released it was a good movie. The special effects were of the quality of that time frame. The story line was good. It followed a classic genre of action and drama touched with some humor. I would recommend to all my friends.,1349049600,,244,4.212765957446808
1256660,4,B000031EGU,"well i got the dvd and it was all scratched up and not so good
so i played it and it turned out to be ok
you can really see the marks and not happy about it,
other than that good movie",1281571200,,184,3.4047619047619047
1256661,2,B000031EGU,"I must be so far outside the age demographics for this movie that I'm willing to give 2 stars. My head says that it's a 1 star flick but I weakened and gave 2. There are some decent actors in this movie, but they are giving 2 dimentional performances as they sleep-walk through what passes for the plot. The action was just OK, the fight scenes (the reason I watched the movie) were poorly done. Special effects were not so special. Van Peebles is a much better actor than what he showed here. OK, he was playing a robot, but Arnold set the standard for android actors and Mario, handcuffed by the script, looks like he walked out of a 1950's SciFi B movie.

If you can watch the movie on TV for free, give it a look. If you can remember the Nixon Impeachment, you may bail after the first 30 minutes.

I doubt there will be a Solo 2 but given the ending, the producer left the door open so consider yourself warned!",1265155200,2,916,4.228571428571429
1256662,4,B000031EGU,"Solo is the perfect soldier. He is a master of combat in all its forms. He has no family. No friends. No birth certificate. No Social Security number. No medical benefits. If he is severly wounded, he will be abandoned by his commanders. No one will cry if Solo is gone. Who, after all, would shed a tear for a killing machine? Which is exactly what Solo is, the very best money can buy. Everything from the action to the acting makes this movie well worth it.  Humor plays a huge role in this movie also.",1263340800,2,505,4.260416666666667
1256663,2,B000031EGU,"This is a pretty barebones DVD, but it is Widescreen... so is the picture quality good?",1171756800,,87,4.5
1256664,3,B000031EGU,"When I recently stumbled upon SOLO on cable TV and realized that Adrien Brody, one of my favorite actors, was third-billed in this Mario Van Peebles action flick, I decided to record it and check it out later for the heck of it. Turns out that was a good idea, since I got the most enjoyment out of this derivative SF/action/adventure when I simply gave up and fast-forwarded to Brody's scenes as Solo's endearingly scruffy creator Dr. Bill Stewart (sounds like the kind of bland name they'd give the hero in a 1950s creature feature -- see, I told you SOLO was derivative! :-). Brody's one of the few performers in the film who actually says his lines with heart and conviction. When he was emoting opposite Van Peebles & Co., I wonder if Brody ever thought one day he'd be winning an Oscar for his starring turn in a Roman Polanski drama? :-) Adrien Brody fans, get the VCR ready; genre fans, try renting THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, FRANKENSTEIN, THE TERMINATOR, or any of the other movies that SOLO rips off, er, pays homage to! :-)",1073347200,,1030,4.543010752688172

1256668,5,B000031EGU,"Really is a good movie. I had been trying to find this movie, but did not know the title and who was in it.  I am glad to have this in my collection.  I finally saw it on one of the movie channels a couple of weeks ago, that is I found out the title.  Thanks",1448928000,,258,3.5714285714285716
1256669,5,B000031EGU,Love it!!! This gent is truly under-rated as an actor/director. Check out Posse& New Jack City. See if you don't agree....,1448323200,,122,4.857142857142857
1256670,5,B000031EGU,"Saw this movie may be twice when I was a kid. It stuck in my mind for some time like Time Cop, Terminator, The Quest, and so many others that when I found it I had to buy it.",1446422400,,174,3.4871794871794872

1256676,2,B000031EGU,"Saying ""The books were better"" is usually true.  That is the case here and then some. This movie is named after the second book and seems to be an attempt to combine the two?  For the low price I paid for the DVD...it was OK but a disappointment after the books. I don't anticipate watching it a 2nd time.  I would however like to see a 3rd book written.",1403222400,,354,4.101449275362318
1256677,5,B000031EGU,I have this movie on VHS but had to get it in DVD to add to my collection of favorites. This movie I do not loan.,1401926400,,113,3.3846153846153846
1256678,1,B000031EGU,The performances are wooden. Overall I think this is a cheap knockoff on the Terminator movies. I watched it all the way through to the end because I'm a moron.,1380931200,,160,4.366666666666666

1256680,5,B000031EGU,"This movie is very underrated. It's very to the point yet doesn't leave you lost. It's akin to Terminator and Rambo however it wasn't a direct clone. There was a lot of action, down to earth moments and a sense of accomplishment as you watch Solo save the people so they could return to their peace lives. It was worth the purchase and thankful after a long time of searching I could find and watch it here on Amazon.",1373068800,,417,4.291139240506329

1256682,5,B000031EGU,I love watching this movie with my dad. My favorite part is when he is learning to laugh and you hear him trying to piece the sounds together.,1359936000,,142,4.107142857142857
1256683,4,B000031EGU,This movie takes place sometime in the present of the government building a cyborg soldier called Solo. Pretty much its like universal soldier and terminator mixed into one. Its a good movie and must see it to find out more.,1357344000,,224,4.625
