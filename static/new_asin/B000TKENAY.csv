8325741,1,B000TKENAY,"I dunno why the other 2 review give it 5 stars.

The lowest is 1 star, if I can, I will give it no (zero) star.

This DVD just focus on combing and brushing of the cat. Plus nail clipping, clean the ear with Q Tip & cleanthe eye with tissue.

When we are talking about award winning show cats (and lots of cat show rosette behind in the cover photo) and professional grooming. Everyone knows that we need to take shower for the cat. And we need to trim its fur. All these technique have NOT been mention or demonstrate in the DVD.

I think only need this DVD if you never handle a cat. But you can learn these by yourselves very soon even you don't buy it.

If you are looking for professional grooming technique, don't waster money on this.",1193184000,4,741,4.153846153846154
8325742,5,B000TKENAY,"I've always had trouble keeping my cats still while trying to brush them. Then, I watched this video and tried one of the tips---brushing my cat while she sat in my lap. It worked! I couldn't believe it! This video showed me step by step how to groom my cats, so I'm a lot more comfortable working with them now that I've received some instruction and tips from a professional cat groomer. Plus, now that I've started brushing my cats more often, my couch stays cleaner ... less cat hair to vacuum! This video is a must-have for any cat owner!",1192665600,2,543,4.3861386138613865
8325743,5,B000TKENAY,"I've had cats my whole life, longhair and shorthair, and this DVD is full of great tips and techniques.  Just seeing her beautifully groomed cats is inspiration enough to get out and try what she clearly demonstrates - and way cheaper and safer than carrying our pets off to an unknown shop!

The nail trimming section showed me a safer and calmer way of handling that job.  And who knew there were different combs and brushes for different coats and grooming needs?  All this is covered in the DVD, and my pet is glad that I found this gem!",1191024000,,541,4.434343434343434
