This film speaks about the challenges the relationship can face and questions how far a son will have to go to allow forgiveness. Chuco(Manny Perez) is a father who constantly fights an internal battle to find a way to win his son back.

Excellent film.",1313280000,3,337,4.694915254237288

8456251,2,B0054509KC,"I wanted to like it because it was filmed in a place I used to live, Scranton PA.  They basically found a bunch of run down properties and filmed in and around them.  The city has lots of cool buildings and vistas, and except for one scene by a frozen lake, they wasted the use of the city.

Now to the movie.  Depressing, with no characters having any redeeming value.  A guy kills his wife in a rage, goes to prison, and because he behaves he is released in 8 1/2 years.  He goes back to his old haunts, including his old gang, who are about the worst group of low-lifes imaginable. The main character has few good qualities either, and makes one dumb decision after another.  I give it two stars because the acting was pretty good, but in the end there is nothing of interest in this movie.  You will dislike all the characters.",1403913600,,831,4.282051282051282
8456252,1,B0054509KC,Not his best work. Stick to Dominican movies that's what we love about him. He tells a Dominican story that we all enjoy. La soga was his best,1388361600,,142,4.107142857142857
8456253,1,B0054509KC,"Manny Perez stars as Chuco, an ex-con released from prison after killing his wife. He tries to reconnect with his young son, Machito, who witnessed the murder of his mother and has been living on the streets ever since.
Set in Scranton, Pennsylvania this film will do little for the city's tourism industry. The filmmakers seem to have made a conscience effort to portray their city in an entirely different light than the Scranton seen on NBC's hit sitcom The Office. This city is not home to a motley crew of funny and quirky characters, but to gangsters, thugs, and lowlifes - a veritable Hell on Earth.
David Castro, as Chuco's young son, gives the role his all. He's too young to realize he should be phoning in his performance, saving his talent for a better movie.
Throughout the film, Chuco feels entitled to his son's forgiveness; he doesn't do anything to earn that forgiveness, and actually ends up making the boy's life worse. Still, the screenplay wants us to root for Chuco - but only because he's the lead character, not because he redeems himself in any way or atones for his sins.
Chuco is not a hero, he's an awful human being, but the movie excuses his behavior. Forged bills itself as a film about redemption - its not. The filmmakers are too lazy to actually ensure their movie has a point.
Kevin Breznahan, an actor best known for his bit roles in comedies, is an odd choice to play the film's heavy. With his helium-infused voice and fey demeanor, Breznahan is about as scary as a Teletubby.
Margo Martindale, as Chuco's alcoholic mother, fares better. Still, one hopes she was actually intoxicated during her scenes; maybe she won't remember spouting out groaners like ""A bitter tree can only grow bitter fruit!""
Many scenes end with the lead characters staring dramatically into the distance, soap opera-like, searching for the profound dialogue the script can not provide them with.
Director Will Wedig's previous credit was the zombie-flick `Rise of the Dead.' Wedig should have continued working in the horror industry, a genre more forgiving of bad writing and poor direction. By tackling a serious drama, Wedig seems to have bitten off more than he can chew.
In a truly tasteless bit of editing, the father's dalliance with a local prostitute is intercut with a scene of the young boy whoring himself out to the town pedophile.
Wedig fills the movie with some obvious symbolism, straight out of screenwriting 101. The father and son are rebuilding a car at the same time they're rebuilding their relationship! In another scene, a man, sacrificing his own life, outstretches his arms and adopts a Christ-like pose. Get it? Throughout the movie you can literally feel Wedig nudging you in the ribs, making sure you don't miss any detail in his multi-layered ""masterpiece.""
At a running time of only seventy-two minutes, Forged is barely feature length. The needlessly constant use of slow motion only serves to pad out the film's scant running time. Still, by the time the end credits roll, you'll have spent too much time with these characters and with this film.",1349481600,,3092,4.835849056603774
8456254,5,B0054509KC,"This officially qualifies as the most depressing movie i've seen in years, but it's also emotionally powerful and most importantly prods you to think about the world we live in. Chief among its many strengths are two leads, a father and son, who make you care about their plight. Their story is a modern tragedy, filled with bad choices and far reaching consequences. I'll admit hoping for a happy ending, but the film went no where close to what i expected. Plus, it's final scene is so abrupt that you can't help but beg to know more.",1327881600,3,536,4.536082474226804
8456255,2,B0054509KC,"This is another indie flick with a sad lame soundtrack. The movie was filmed during the winter in Scranton, Pa. It is in color, but might as well have been in black and white. This gives the movie a constant sad and despair feel by design.

Manny Perez gets out of prison. He is an ex-con who killed his son's mother. He wants to go straight, but circumstances prevents him from doing so. Meanwhile his son is living in a junk yard making a living performing tricks. He meets up with Manny and wants to kill him, but doesn't.

Manny wants to help his son and ends up stealing from the mob...I think you get the idea where this is going. I kept waiting for the movie to shift gears and the next thing I knew, it was over.

The movie boasts a bad sound track, flashbacks, and an attempt to create art out of junk. The acting was sound, but the movie was too slow.

F-bomb, quick sex scene. 1 1/2 stars.",1320537600,,900,4.184971098265896

A movie about a father and son and the redemption that lies within.  Going into this indie film my expectations were not that high and was expecting an average indie film.  I was taken aback when saw the credits roll and the film ended.  This film really moved me and had me emotional at the end.  It is a movie with emotion, great acting and a terrific atmosphere.  The dark and gritty camera shots and color really created the enviroment for the film.  Overall it was a great film and I recommend anyone who is anyone to see this great film that came from the heart of Scranton, PA.

P.S.- Manny Perez played an excellent role!",1313452800,5,653,4.383333333333334
