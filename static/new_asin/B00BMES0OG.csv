5647253,5,B00BMES0OG,"Another GREAT Michael Ellis DVD. I have used food motivation with my dogs for years but
have always had a problem when to slow down and stop using food. This DVD shows you the
transition from food to toy motivation and building drive. It's a WOW DVD well worth the price.",1323475200,2,271,4.333333333333333
5647254,2,B00BMES0OG,"Michael Ellis's method is not new but he does package it in an easy-to-follow manner. And he personally is very good. However, the people in this dvd ~ supposedly trainers already in the dog training field who are in further training with Ellis ~ can't seem to get it no matter how clearly they're instructed or shown. They appear to be off-the-street pet people. Not one individual shows that they get it and can perform the exercises successfully with their dog.  The only one in this dvd who can perform is Michael Ellis. He is worth watching but not on this dvd.

Seeing people learning something new is great.  Seeing those same people demonstrate that they've learned is completely lacking in this dvd. Watch it all the way through.  Not one iota of proficiency is demonstrated by any of the trainees at any point in this video. From getting the dog's attention to proper food delivery to heeling without yanking the dog while he's looking out across the hills instead of at the handler. Isn't that what the attention-getting exercises were for? To get the dog's attention completely conditioned before going outdoors to learn heeling and other behaviors with distractions?

Tom Lam's ""Making the Ultimate Connection"" takes people and their dogs from square one to proficiency using relationship and food. And the people get it. And these ARE just regular people.

The difference between ""The Power of Training Dogs with Food"" and Tom Lam's ""Making the Ultimate Connection"" is: throwing together a bunch of so-so video clips and attaching a high price tag to the result versus professionally filming a similar but more effective methodology demonstrating the progression of learning from beginning to end. One 4-5 hr. dvd for $65 plus S&H versus Two four hour dvd's for $85 plus S&H.

Check out the link below.  Best training money I've ever spent.",1306800000,8,1854,4.919871794871795
5647255,4,B00BMES0OG,"I am not professional trainer but everything I want to know about training may house dog
I get in several DVDs. One of them are this DVD and The power of playing tug with your dog also Michael's DVD. Michael Ellis is great narrator and he explains his methods in very simple and clear language. Unfortunaly I am very far away from his school,
and I do not have the opportunity to go to his classes.

I have just one annotation. Some parts of DVD are not good quality. They are recorded with non-professional camera so sounds aren't good as they should be.
Pity, because spoils general impression of this DVD.",1293667200,4,608,4.4774774774774775
5647256,5,B00BMES0OG,"I had the good fortune to take a course from Michael with my then year-old working line German Shepherd. He is a lot of dog, and as a small woman, I needed a method, preferably positive, to keep him obedient. It's over a year later, and I still use the methods taught on this DVD every day. I have all the tools I need to teach new behaviors motivationally, and to keep the old ones polished. Michael is kind and clear in his communication style. I would recommend this DVD and/or his classes to anyone with a dog that they want to train.",1291420800,4,538,4.233009708737864
8570811,5,B00BMES0OG,"I  own this DVD and along with the related DVD, called ""power of playing tug with your dog"". This DVD is part of the Michael Ellis system of training, which is a play/prey and reward based approach. It uses marker training. The idea behind marker training is inductive learning, combined with conditioned reinforcement. It's very important to understand that when you're communicating with an animal, you can't teach it ""algebra"" by explaining the subject in human language.  You must explain it to the animal at the animal's intelligence level, not at a human intelligence level. Therefore you must ""mark"" the instant the exact response is achieved.  The animal must in his mind see the behavior as a ""series of mental photographs, or frame-by-frame"" type of events, and must learn to associate the right ""frame"" with the reward event.  The complex set of behaviors we see in a competition dog are not trained all at once. Instead, for example, take the recall from 25 yards away. The dog is first taught the  ending first, coming to owner's front, and then from the front, into the heel position.  The dog has to also be taught the down-stay. The dog has to be taught to run quickly.  Each step was trained individually: the down, later the down-stay, the recall into the front , the ""finish"" into the heel position, the understanding of the ""heel"" position.  So the finished exercise, looks like the merely ran to the owner, but in reality each step was captured and taught separately and individually and then assembled into the finished result, like in an assembly line process of ""mental pictures"" that have been created for each position. This video establishes the ""language"" of training between the handler and the dog, a mutual human-to-animal dialogue with ""marker words"", and ""duration"" words and ""reward events"", so that the communication system between you and the animal is clear, understood and is motivation based, not force based. Because learning as seen as either a ""food event"" or a ""let's play tug"" event, training is seen as non-conflict, reward based system. If you are trying to create a competition dog, this video is simply a must, to teach the learning process. This video, along with the ""playing tug"" with your dog video are the two core courses in the Michael Ellis system. The other videos, such as the competition heeling video, the ""finishing work"" video and so forth, are all based on the communication system of marker training. To understand the others, you must understand these two videos first and foremost. The explanation is clear, based on behavior science, and Michael has the power of being a very gifted human communicator, not just animal communicator. Truly an excellent, high level teach method. Highly recommended.",1514246400,3,2764,4.980477223427332
8570812,5,B00BMES0OG,I have worked with a handful of dog trainers in person and spent a considerable amount of money doing so.  I learned more from this video than I did in any of those training sessions.  This was the first of 4 DVDs I've watched by Michael Ellis w/Leerburg and I've been impressed with all of them.  Highly Recommend!,1465689600,3,315,4.396551724137931
8570813,3,B00BMES0OG,"Michael Ellis is a phenomenal trainer.  His instruction is positive and easy to understand.  Dogs work happily with his system, and they are quick, precise and eager to learn.  He is professional, and down to earth, without the ego and blustering that seems to exist with some other trainers.  The content is great, and had the quality of the video been better I would have given it five stars.  Unfortunately, the quality is not great.  For the price, it should not feel like a home movie.  Michael's brand is dynamic and unique, but it appears intertwined somewhat confusingly with Leerburg.  At this date, the video is listed on Amazon with Ed Frawley under the title not Michael Ellis.  In fact, Michael's name was not listed anywhere on the DVD package, or the DVD itself.  Leerburg Enterprises, Inc. is shown in huge letters on the front of the DVD case, and the back lists Ed Frawley's training experience, Ed Frawley's short bio, Ed Frawley's website, and a photo of guess who?  Ed and Jeff Frawley and their dogs.  The only way I was able to discern that this was a Michael Ellis DVD was that there happened to be a picture of him on the cover.  It seems obvious, but the viewer might find it more relevant if Michael's name were on the DVD, as well as something about Michael, his experience and his website.",1452816000,5,1318,4.581196581196581
8570814,5,B00BMES0OG,Micheal Ellis is a very talented dog trainer and I found this video to be very helpful when I was training my stubborn yet greedy German Shepherd Dog. Ellis makes it easy to follow along and practice with your dog while giving tips that will help even the most novice of dog trainers. I learned a lot and was able to apply it in a dog training class later that really impressed the instructor. It will improve your timing while training and help you continue to reinforce good behavior with food instead of using force or raised voices. Our dog really took to this training and we were able to wean her off the treats a bit so that she doesn't always expect a treat for everything she ever does.,1418688000,,695,4.3538461538461535

8570816,4,B00BMES0OG,A nice DVD.  Could use more practical hints.,1414713600,,44,4.5
8570817,5,B00BMES0OG,Improved DVD from the previous one. A must have if you are a training dog. Surf the internet before to watch this DVD it will help to understand the basic concepts faster.,1380758400,2,171,4.375
8570818,5,B00BMES0OG,"This video is great. It show exactly what must be done and even what shouldn't. The guy behind the camera did a wonderful job. I want to meet this trainer. What I have learned just viewing and practicing what I see has really done wonders with my 2 dogs.
I would highly recommend this video for any one who needs help with training.
The seller was prompt and the product was as described.",1377388800,,388,4.328767123287672
8570819,5,B00BMES0OG,"It's very repetitive, which is good because it helps you remember the basic precepts when actually out working with your dog.  It breaks things down very clearly about how to time your reward.  Truly, that's the hardest part!  It feels good to be using positive training methods with our dog.",1376956800,,292,4.8
8570820,5,B00BMES0OG,I feel that watching this along with several other DVDs that I purchased has really opened my eyes. Best of all I can see where I was going in the wrong direction with what I hope for an end result.,1353628800,,198,3.975
