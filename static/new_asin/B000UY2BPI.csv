8215579,4,B000UY2BPI,"I gather the plot of this one was 'inspired by' (pinched from)'Dot the I' but transferred geographically to Dubai. It is about a girl (Urvashi Sharma) engaged to a multimillionaire (Bobby Deol) when a guy (Akshaye Khanna) connects with her at an engagement celebration she has with friends. Guy pursues her a bit and she eventually relents and falls for him. He makes phone calls to someone unknown that suggests this wasn't an accidental meet and there is a set-up somehow. Often people seem to be recording what is happening on hand-held cameras - what is that about? I cant say more without ruining it. However there are lots of satisfying twists (some predictable but fun to go with).
Although the cover says it is the 'most shocking thriller of the year' (2007), it isn't. It has the most minimal violence and a little tension, but the 'shocks' are the sudden turns of events I guess. btw In India several reviewers called this plot 'ridiculous rather than shocking'!
WE have the same leads that I enjoyed in thriller 'Humraaz' which was excellent and recommended. As in that movie things aren't clear as even the goodies can have a dark side, and events turn in a moment.
Akshaye, Bobby and newcomer Urvashi are all really good. Once or twice I though Bobby was overdoing it but then found it was intentional to the plot.
There is a decent soundtrack and a couple of dances but appropriate to the plot (i.e. a professional dance troupe and a nightclub).
Elsewhere on the Net it has got mixed results. Some Indian sites I checked had it below average. On IMDb it was sitting at 5.5 out of 10. However some age groups gave it much higher  and many women rated this much higher. I enjoyed this one and it is a keeper.",1245456000,,1720,4.584415584415584
