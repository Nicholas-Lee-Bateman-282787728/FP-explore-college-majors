8584536,5,B00CPKZLM0,"...loves this movie. He is 4, and one of his favorite pastimes is watching movies. It is very age-appropriate, and I'm pleased that he enjoys it. The only downside is, as an only child, he often wants his parents to watch movies with him, and it is quite dull, much like most wholesome, educational shows such as Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank. If you are extremely conscientious of what your child watches, this would probably be alright.",1379721600,,444,4.632911392405063
8584537,5,B00CPKZLM0,I have a 3 and a 5 year old.  They really liked this movie.  It's wholesome and sweet and has good message.  It's not fast and violent.  I would suggest it for kids who are between super young DVD's but not quite ready for the fast paced and super power/violent DVD's.,1376784000,,268,4.196078431372549
