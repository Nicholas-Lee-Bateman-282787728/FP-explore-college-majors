8587050,3,B00CX0JN4O,"The packaging was nice....it came with a car ornament & a key chain. However, most importantly there was A LOT of content missing from the discs them self.  We viewed many of the episodes on Utube & saw where the content was missing from these discs.  We paid so much money for this set & to find so much missing, edited out was a HUGE disappointment. When we got the set it came with 10 CD's only. Most my family subscribe to Likeok so they've seen all the episodes till present & thought 10 CD's was not enough for all the material. I brushed it off & said, "" No, Amazon doesn't sell stuff that's incomplete I'm sure it's all there."" After viewing on Utube I was sooooo wrong !!!! and disappointed !!!!!",1385424000,9,705,4.293233082706767
