2070371,5,B00029NKTC,"Of course, not all of the clients at my agency are this wacked out. And actually, this is the first time I've seen an $88 car...we usually run $88 down, $88 a month for our clients or they have cars as low as $995 on the lot. What I love about Slasher is that it shows that it takes all kinds. I had a hard time not laughing at some of the customers that showed up on the lot. Folks, I write these ads for a living. I can tell you that if someone's advertising cars for as low as $88, that means that there is just one on the lot and I can tell you that 99% of us would not be caught dead in that car.

Ah, but the 1% that would...! Anyone will get a kick out of these customers coming in for that $88 car. I'm sure all our clients would split their sides laughing at this, and perhaps crying too. I know it's hard to move these units. I'm responsible for developing new creative to help guys like you sell more of them. Sales like this will surely bring them in with the Slasher. We run advertorials quite frequently for clients who have used the Slasher before and others with imitations which we must call a different name in order for our clients not to run into legal problems with it.

I don't think that only automotive industry people should see this. I happened to stumble upon it while reading about other documentaries. This one was recommended to me and I laughed. I had to find it. One of my assistants saw it was coming on IFC and taped it for our team to see if we could gain new perspective. For me, I gained the perspective that not all my clients are crooks, and that these guys are working really hard to be able to feed their families too. I could feel their pain. It's hard work being in sales.

I think anyone in the market for a vehicle, new or used, should check this out. People can only take advantage of you if you let them, and not all car salesman or dealerships are bad. I say shame on the car buyers for not doing their homework beforehand. And if your credit is bad, don't expect to get a low payment on your new car. Either prepare to pay a large down payment or make large monthly payments. Or consider a used vehicle for crying out loud! Half the customers that showed up for the sale in this documentary looked like they couldn't even afford a new pair of shoelaces! Research the cars you're interested in...the internet makes this astonishinly easy. Figure out what you can afford. Determine your credit standing. And live within your means.

And a special note to the Slasher himself, if you ever read this, boy do you have a tough job. But not once did we see you say anything rude to any of those customers and I applaud you for that. I would've lost my mind dealing with people like that. You had such a high energy level the entire time, all the while you were probably thinking of your family to survive those 3 sale days. It's also nice to put a face with a name. I just imagined some poor shmoe from the sales department being forced to walk around in some sort of mascot suit in the hot, hot sun. I guess it doesn't help being in a tux though does it?

In conclusion, this being by far the longest review I've written, I really do think that most people would be able to take something very valuable away by watching this documentary. To the salespeople on the lots: watch this now! Get it and have your entire dealership watch it together. It will give you a new perspective on your business which is never a bad thing. To the car buyers everywhere: you only get taken advantage of because you don't research what you're buying. This isn't a $10 t-shirt at the mall. This is a large purchase. You wouldn't just buy a new TV without checking if it has the S video input and all that other junk (reminds me...I need a new TV). You compare the brands and see who has the best quality with the features you want at a price that is most reasonable to you. That's what you should be doing when you buy a car.  If you go into a dealership knowing as much as you can about the vehicle you wish to purchase particularly regarding prices and vehicle features, you will be better able to negotiate a deal that makes you and the dealership happy without, pardon the expression, taking it up the a**. I highly, highly, highly recommend this documentary.",1138838400,9,4287,4.25398773006135
2070372,4,B00029NKTC,"Bought this DVD because a trainer I met told me about it. I'm new to the car business, but have enjoyed this title because it is not made just for the car guy. As with all documentaries, I'm sure the stuff on the cutting room floor would make a great docu as well. But the stuff they left in is insightful, funny, and even disturbing at times. If you want to be entertained, Mike Bennett will do that! Awesome. No five stars because there is always rom for more.",1134518400,2,462,4.202247191011236
2070373,5,B00029NKTC,"It's an intriguing look into the automotive business. Thank God John Landis is the director. He kept it where it needed to be and I, as an auto dealer, appreciate the job he did. Well done, John!",1128556800,2,195,4.297297297297297
2070374,4,B00029NKTC,"If you have been, are in, think of being part of, ever wondered about the automotive business then you must watch this dvd. John Landis is an icon. His work on the documentary is evident in the way the ""slasher"" runs his mouth between takes. The stress he is under is obvious and the daily grind has taken its toll. Buy it now and see it before your month ends. Also, buy ""Cars and People; Pissing at 60 Miles an Hour"" by Ziegler and ""Suckers"" the DVD.",1110672000,6,452,4.206896551724138

2070376,4,B00029NKTC,"Wow. After the years I've been in the business, going from sales person to closer, to desk manager to gsm to owner of my own dealership, I still have the turns in my stomach. If you're in the business you know what I mean.  I watched this movie and felt them, the stress of not knowing if ""enough cars will be sold"" and the drive this man has, his face and heart strained with time and self torture. I encourage EVERY car sales professional to watch this movie. Also, read the Ziegler books ""Cars and People: Pissing at 60 miles an hour"" and ""Cars and People: How To Put the Two Together.""",1101340800,14,589,4.258928571428571
2070377,3,B00029NKTC,"Screaming like a wrestler and drinking like a fish (beer for breakfast anyone?) Michael Bennett is a professional used car salesman who travels around the country helping car dealerships take advantage of morons who actually believe that they are getting good deals.

This weekend The Slasher and his two-man ""mercenary"" crew are descending on Memephis like foul-mouth locust.  They spread the word about a $88 car and sure enough here come the suckers.  Unfortunately for Michael most of them have bad credit and no money.  He does end up working his ass off (he even runs out in the road at one point trying to get customers!) and sells over 30 cars.  What I found just as interesting as The Slasher antics was the fact that people actually expected to get cars for next to nothing.  A lot of the would be customers were genuinely disappointed that they couldn't get a $7,000 used SUV for $88!  There was a $88 car, but man oh man was that thing a pile of junk.  It ending up dying a loud death as soon as the girl pulled in her driveway.

Playing more like a video diary instead of a actual documentary I myself was a little disappointed myself that we didn't get to see The Slasher in action in different parts of the country.  Did he change his pitch in areas where people actually have money?  Also how did Michael become The Slasher and are there others like him?",1100476800,3,1370,4.506072874493927
2070426,5,B00029NKTC,I'm not one for horror movies but this is definitely one I'll see again!  Great Film!  You should buy two copies so you have a back up after watching the first one too much.,1277856000,,173,4.0588235294117645
2070427,5,B00029NKTC,This is the greatest film ever made and is available at a fair and equitable price. It's like the 'Citizen Kane' of film. The acting is superb. The cinemotography is breathtaking. I highly recommend it to everyone who is currently alive.,1277856000,,237,4.804878048780488
2070428,5,B00029NKTC,"I've been in the car business for right at 10 years, everything from sales to GSM and F&I Manager. For the last 4 years I have been performing these ""Liquidation Sales Events"" at dealerships all over the United States. This movie is an EXCELLENT portrayal of what life is like on the road.

These sales attract the best salesmen and closers in the business to come in and basically take over the dealership for a week at a time. Dealers hire us because 9 times out of 10 their sales staff are very lazy and complacent...we are sort of skilled assassin's coming in for one purpose...to make as much Gross Profit as possible during the 5 day sales event.

This documentary captures everything, the ""whining"" dealership ""sales"" team(more like professional greeters!), the pressure to produce in the short time given for the sale, and the amount of customers and sales we produce in such a short time.",1259884800,2,897,4.707006369426751
2070429,2,B00029NKTC,"Don't spend too much money on this. The video is worth about $6.00.  The moral of the story is you start at a high price, then you knock off $4,000 and the buyer gets excited. It's painful to watch poor people agonize over the monthly payments. I liked the main character, you sympathize with him, but not for $22. Just rent it if you want to see it.",1251849600,,350,4.147058823529412
2070430,5,B00029NKTC,"Having been in the car business for more years than I care to remember, this was a fantastic documentary. I bought this for my sales staff and had them watch it. Gave them a fresh perspective on how the public perceived them at their worst and their best. All too often we see only the bad things the net and TV post about the average car salesman, but this movie allowed the more human side of the sales professional. We are human beings, most with integrity and feelings, familes to feed, lives to live. You can only be taken advantage of, if you let someone. I get so tired of the crap the 'experts' spout about how the dealer will screw you. If the average consumer would simply do their homework, come to a dealership prepared, be courteous, yet knowledgeable, they'd end up with a much better deal and no one would havbe to be the 'bad guy' in the process. Great movie. Highly recommend to any person in the sales end of the auto industry. However, the average consumer, non auto employed, would probably not get too much from it.",1249430400,,1036,4.429319371727749

2070432,4,B00029NKTC,"As a car dealer in today's market it was a very scary movie. I have a dealership near an airport and the dealership in the movie reminded me a little of ours. It was so depressing to see the ""slasher"", a human being live his life this way and in my business I see a lot of individuals like this. Even more depressing the owner of the dealership like so many trying to make ends meet hiring an individual who will do anything to sell a car. As always the less fortunate such as lower income and bad credit customers are the target for these vultures. All in all the movie is actual and truthful of what the director was depicting.",1180396800,3,629,4.206611570247934
2070433,3,B00029NKTC,"I wasn't sure what to rate this film because I have mixed feelings about it. On one level it's a fast-paced look at how a used car salesman makes a living cheating poor black people (among others) out of their money. On the other hand, the Slasher is a deeply disturbed father never home for his wife and kids. I found myself getting angry that nobody cared enough for the star of this film to confront him about what he did to himself; in fact, in the featurette you can see the filmmaker trying to make him stand up straight for the camera while dead drunk. I kept wondering how his daughters felt about growing up with an alcoholic father with a beer in his hand every morning. I would very much have liked to see this film end with a scene in which the Slasher's so-called friends and the director gather around him and say, ""We're taking up a collection to get you into rehab before you drink yourself to death. If you don't care about yourself any more than you do about the people you fleece, at least think about what you are doing to your family.""",1169769600,2,1056,4.311557788944723

2070435,4,B00029NKTC,"When you go car shopping, you automatically know it is going to be a very long process.  As a society that takes our cars as a status symbol, we should also be aware of the tactics that are used to get us to buy a car beyond our means. Additionally, I came to realize that Michael Bennet must have ADHD. He could not stop talking or moving.  Also, people with ADHD usually self-medicate.  He drinks pretty non-stop and is a chain smoker. I have boys who have been diagnosed with ADHD, and this movie gave me a glimpse into an adult with this disorder!

All I can tell you is, The Slasher is to the horror genre as booby tassles are to a saloon stripper.

8024466,4,B00029NKTC,"Slasher is a documentary that looks at what it takes to sell used cars. The Slasher's real name is Michael Bennett. He lives in southern California and flies to various car lots around the U.S. where he helps the dealers sell ""stale inventory."" The film focuses both on the tactics that Slasher uses to sell cars and on Slasher's personality.

In Slasher, Bennett travels to Memphis, Tennessee, for a 3-day sale at a struggling Toyota dealership. The dealership has a credit-poor, working-class clientele. Slasher's biggest advertising ""hook"" is selling cars for just $88; the catch is that the buyers don't know which cars carry that price. During the sale, Slasher creates excitement by parading around the lot with a microphone while wearing a tuxedo.

Bennett hires attractive young women as ""Slashettes"" - hostesses. The film shows Bennett interviewing potential Slashettes. After the interviews, Bennett makes vicious comments about  the interviewees. Viewers also learn that Slasher is an alcoholic, a heavy smoker, and a cynic. Bennett isn't boring, he is - at best - an ambivalent figure.

John Landis (""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Trading Places"") returns to directing with Slasher. He adds some great visuals from Memphis and also uses classic Memphis soul as a soundtrack. One veteran salesman recounts how he sold Elvis Presley ""about ten Cadillacs."" Unfortunately, the dialogue is difficult to hear at times.

Slasher is an interesting film that reveals a cynical subculture. I recommend the film.",1280102400,,1508,5.266666666666667
