He begged me to go online and find it, even though he was not sure of the name just a song in the movie.  Turns out it was this older movie and we were thrilled to find it on Amazon Marketplace.  Can't wait for it to arrive.",1143504000,,362,4.0

First viewing left the older children and me in gales of laughter as we observed the oddity of the Professor Paleoentologist, but it captured every ounce of my grandson's attention.  Silly, unique, and definetly a one-of-a-kind movie!  I have to get one of my own because the rental has to be returned one day!!",1124409600,,413,4.63013698630137
