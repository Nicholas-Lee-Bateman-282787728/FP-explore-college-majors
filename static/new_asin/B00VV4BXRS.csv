8711364,5,B00VV4BXRS,"Greetings All, as harsh as I have been to Media Blasters over the  years for their many mistakes, I have always been truthful. I decided to bite the bullet as it were, when I found this for purchase at Best Buy of all places. Was $15 worth it to get the last 3 episodes correct? -I figured if they were still wrong, at least I could take it back. Initially when I opened the packaging and saw the disc labels and serial numbers were the same, I panicked. But I put the last disc in. Thankfully it appears all the errors of the previous release were fixed. So for anyone who wants a flawless release of this series, and OVA, this would be it. I kind of wish I could be reimbursed for the faulty initial release, but you live and learn. If MB ever decides to release the 2nd series (The Inspector), I'll definitely wait to purchase it until some positive reviews are in regarding its quality.",1447632000,2,890,4.2976190476190474
