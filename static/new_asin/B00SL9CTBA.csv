6991214,4,B00SL9CTBA,"The original series with Hermione Norris were excellent, but the series IV-VI with Simone Lahbib are not as good, but still better than almost any American series.",1423785600,,163,5.074074074074074
6991215,5,B00SL9CTBA,I have seen all these episodes a few years ago and I wanted to add this serie to my British Collection :) :) I will enjoy watching them whenever I want!!!,1423526400,,154,4.0
6991216,5,B00SL9CTBA,"My guess is--and it is only a guess--that the American series Perception with actor Eric McCormack is based on this production, however, that is where the comparison ends.  I have nothing against Perception or Eric McCormack, but Wire in the Blood is light years away in every respect, including storylines and superb production values. Because it is a British production, it is more graphic and realistic and Robson Green's performance is excellent, along with the rest of a great supporting cast.  It is a series for adult audiences due to some incidental nudity and strong themes. I purchased the entire collection in the Non-USA version because it was considerably cheaper, so if you already own a multi-region player, it's a great value. Highly recommended.",1415404800,,762,5.137096774193548
6991217,4,B00SL9CTBA,"I like so many of these murder series! I must say they can get a bit depressing if it is not some subtle humor written in. This series did not have that. So it seems to get a little heavy if I watch too many. So I break it up after a few sets with some other dvds  which are not so dark! Have liked them all so far. Good writing, good subject matter and good acting. So, glad I bought it!",1413331200,,388,3.731707317073171
6991218,5,B00SL9CTBA,Hi love the show. I like collecting complete TV shows. But I'm finding it hard to track down some of these shows. Such as Where the heart is TV show. Can you help ?,1400371200,,164,3.8529411764705883
6991219,4,B00SL9CTBA,i obviously love this series or i wouldnt have ordered it. what was tricky about it was that the first and second season all played in region 1 where i live in u.s. and season 3 4 5 6 all were in region 4. i don't have a multi player and i found a program to play it on my computer which isn't as comfortable to sit at as the couch to watch a show. i had wished it was all in one region. my computer program said it could only play it in region 4 ...4 times ....so now i guess i have to find a way to buy a multi region player. so i wasn't expecting that. i felt a little bad about it because the first two seasons were fun to watch from couch with friends.  i still love the series so i cant complain i am happy to have it i guess..but i felt tricked by the change of regions part way in. other than that the disks were clean and played fine when i had them in something that could play them. i don't know why the world cant just pick one region and let everyone buy and see the beautiful things that are being produced on dvd. it came fast enough and i would recommend it to someone but i would also warn them that they would need a way to play the dvd's after season one and two,1399766400,,1181,3.820408163265306
6991220,5,B00SL9CTBA,For those who enjoy a good thriller this series will keep you captivated whilst coming to know the central characters and see how events interact with their everyday lives.  Robson Green was exceptional in the role and never became predictable. This series is money well spent.,1351987200,2,277,5.021739130434782

6991226,4,B00SL9CTBA,"I have to give the product itself five stars, but -1 star because of the poor reputation of Amazons CEO Jeff Bezoswho received a $6M CIA contract and also owns The Washington Post newspaper thats supposed to report the unbiased/confirmed TRUTH--not propaganda and half-truths from anonymous/unnamed news sources.

6991229,5,B00SL9CTBA,"British crime shows avoid the MTV-type camera work, stock characters, cleanly homogenous plot lines with no ambiguity. Robson Green is compelling as the oblivious but brilliant investigator and the crew around him pitch-perfect as the street detectives unconvinced of his methods. Rent it on Netlfix; you will want to see more.",1478390400,,327,5.431372549019608
6991230,5,B00SL9CTBA,"Loved this when I saw it on Netflix. Then it disappeared - had to see it again. Excellent mystery and Robson Green's character is so compelling. Scary Crime Thriller with lots of violence - makes me get up, check my window and door locks.",1477699200,,238,4.431818181818182
6991231,5,B00SL9CTBA,"I fell in love with this show when it first aired in the states, and I, like most of the die-hard fans of the first 3 seasons, was totally crushed when the lead actress left. But I have to say, I couldn't be more satisfied with the remaining seasons. Remarkably, it holds up and survives the lost of a character that brought such amazing chemistry with the lead actor to the show!! At the end of the day, this show is about the beautiful, brilliant, surprising, funny and intensely empathetic character Dr. Tony Hill. A cliche? Yes! But still, Robson Green was born to play this character and I couldn't get enough. Another surprise is that the series ends with the same level of intelligence, surprise, sophistication, emotion and dignity that it began with. May be too gritty for some, but if you like your crime mysteries crackling, with a little seediness and a whole lot of intelligence, humor and depth, you need to give this a try. I loooooove this show and it still stands up after all this time!!!",1477353600,,1006,4.56353591160221

6991233,5,B00SL9CTBA,"After reading some of Val McDermid's books, I was hooked on Tony Hill and Carol Jordan!  Imagine my delight to find out that there had been a wonderful British TV series based on her characters!  I rented the first couple, but they were difficult to find in the US.  When I saw the whole six seasons available as a set, I was overjoyed.  They do not disappoint.  Very dark, gritty, and graphic, like Ms. McDermid's books...definitely not for the squeamish, but if that's what you enjoy reading and watching, you'll love this series, and grieve when it ends!  Robson Green is perfection as Tony, and I developed quite the crush on him while watching the series.",1474156800,2,660,4.646551724137931
6991234,5,B00SL9CTBA,Gritty realistic story lines.  Great characterization by Robson Green.,1473292800,,70,6.777777777777778
6991235,5,B00SL9CTBA,"Love the series, brilliant  quirky characters, I am half way through. If you like dark pshycological, this is for you. Each show is about 1 1/2 hour but each episode is intense and time stands still. Highly recommended.",1472947200,,219,4.7631578947368425
6991236,4,B00SL9CTBA,"So far, I like this series.  I had not seen it before.  I love Robson Green in Grantchester.  That is how I got exposed to his acting. This finds him in a totally different genre  As others have mentioned, this is a very dark series and I can only watch one or two episodes at a time.  Really delves into the evil and awfulness of human nature.",1472688000,,344,4.074626865671642

6991241,5,B00SL9CTBA,"I watched this series years ago. I wanted to watch it again, but could not find it streaming on Prime or Netflix, so, I decided to order the DVD set. I thought it was a good price for all of the episodes. This is a VERY dark series, which I prefer. Excellent casting and cinematography.. This series deals with very disturbing themes. If that kind of thing does not bother you, I highly recommend this series.",1468540800,3,409,4.394736842105263

6991243,5,B00SL9CTBA,"Love anything with Robson Green, but this series is perhaps the best thing he has done.  This is probably because, from what I've read, this series is a project he had a real passion for.  Very interesting and exciting plots.  Both of his co-stars - 1st Hermione Norris and later Simone Lahbib - are very good in their roles.  So glad I bought the entire series and have already watched it twice and will be watching again.",1466121600,,423,4.454545454545454

6991248,5,B00SL9CTBA,I originally purchased the series because I had watched touching evil and was drawn to another series with robson green... I binged watched this series one weekend....OMG... Its great and addicting..... And have watched it over and over...the stories are better than the books.. The characters enjoyable...  And one can never get enough of robson green no matter what show he is in....,1453766400,2,385,5.111111111111111

6991251,3,B00SL9CTBA,"i recently received this series as a gift....some of the discs were
  defective......freezing, skipping, damaged...even though no major
  scratches could be seen....packaging very poor in cardboard sleeves...
my guess is that this may have damaged discs since they need to be slid out, etc...
(the SHOW itself, with some episodes that were not damaged in major
  ways is VERY GOOD...robson green, always excellent...)
in fairness to amazon or seller involved, they made good on the problem...
  however, we did not bother replacing the set since seller could not be sure
  other copies would be better...
sad since it's a good series...but packaging on ANY DVD should be much better
  than this

6991252,5,B00SL9CTBA,Probably my favorite drama/mystery TV series ever! ! I so wish they'd bring it back as Val keeps writing more books.  Would love to see at least all the books she's written since the show ended into movies or something.,1449273600,,219,4.475

6991254,4,B00SL9CTBA,"An outstanding series with many plotlessness and twists which< I am sure, will appear in knock off series on both sides of the Atlantic.  The characters have very good chemistry and are well developed. no ""spoilers' here so I can't get too in-depth on some of the things that I thought mad the show great or that bothered me.  Well worth the money.  The only downside was the choice of packaging as you will probably be picking DVDs up off the floor every time you have to open the packet.",1444521600,5,489,4.411111111111111
6991255,4,B00SL9CTBA,"Really a terrific series.  The acting is great, and although the stories are intense, they are very spell binding.",1444089600,,114,5.0
6991256,2,B00SL9CTBA,"Wire in the Blood is ultraviolent, showing graphic and endless serial killing, and actually quite boring over time.  There is little in-depth character development among the principal players outside their gruesome daytime jobs, aside from establishing that Tony is a sociopath, and the story line in each episode runs along the lines of, ""Wow, isn't Tony amazing!"" This was so disappointing that I knew I would never view it again, and I returned it on a sell-back basis, salvaging what I could from my original mistaken transaction.",1442448000,4,534,5.137931034482759
6991257,5,B00SL9CTBA,"Totally enjoy this series, but for those hard of hearing, like myself, they don't include closed captioning.",1442275200,,108,5.411764705882353
6991258,4,B00SL9CTBA,"The show is a British crime drama that follows the cases of the police with the assistance of University professor and clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill. The show can be a bit disturbing at times but the acting is quite good. Robson Green does a fantastic job of creating the character of Tony Hill, who is one part brilliant and one part absent minded professor. The chemistry he has with Hermione Morris (DCI Carol Jordan) is excellent and she too brings her character alive. I don't recall when I first saw the show, but I've been waiting a long time to collect it.

The 2015 release includes the entire series in a quasi-digipak package with slip cover. Unfortunately its DVD only and I wonder if its the best quality it could be. I did notice a little bit of noise in scenes with the sky and occasional ladder stepping for example at the end of first episode when one character is reaching their hand towards another. The pairing of the 2008 special Prayer of the Bone with the 2002 first episode of season one is a little odd. However, these are mostly minor nitpicks for me. What I found most irritating was how this set was put together. Its sort of like a digipak which is a gatefold style. Almost like a book it can open up and sometimes have several folds. It is often made with cardstock (yes like your greeting cards) with a plastic DVD tray glued on. The more solid ones usually have a double layer of cardstock. However, many publishers seeking to cut corners have gotten rid of the plastic trays and instead have just made slots/slits in the paper to stick the DVDs into. This method makes the DVDs prone to falling out of the slots, and yes my set arrived with loose discs. Some companies put a coating on the cardstock (sometimes called coverstock) where the discs go into to protect from scratching. This publisher did not do that. The plastic trays can be fragile but usually provide better protection for the discs than this new method. So be aware that this collection is a bit flimsy.",1441929600,31,2009,4.534435261707989
6991259,5,B00SL9CTBA,"Hard to limit yourself to watching only one episode at a time. Robson Green has outdone anything else he has done with this series. Each one is a movie in itself. You could not find anything better being shown in a theater. Well written, directed, cast, and not to be outdone by anything else I have seen recently.",1438732800,4,314,4.431034482758621
6991260,5,B00SL9CTBA,"The best ""detective"" show that has ever been on TV in my opinion. Tony Hill is played to perfection and is an outstanding character.

I only wish it was still being made today because I really miss it.  I won't go into any details because this is a show you should watch for yourself if you like gritty crime dramas but be warned it can be very graphic, so do not watch it with children or squeamish adults in the room.",1437523200,9,436,4.105882352941176

Wow!!  Indescribable - except to say that if you love a really dark, horrifying, and somewhat surreal approach to the murder-mystery and suspense-thriller genres, look no further!  These episodes will have your mind spinning out of control - in almost the very same way that Robson Green's character, Dr. Tony Hill, does.  Exceptional cast and crew (and music!) - a must-see!!

Wire in the Blood would appear to be a great program but I wouldn't know as I didn't get to see how episode 1 of the first season ended. Dvd's 1,3, and 7, of the set of 12 dvd's, were defective. This set is supposed to be brand new, as in never before used, and I found the defective dvd's to have the same problem... freezing up. I quit checking the quality after the 7th dvd. I tried to play these dvds on another machine with the same results. The packaging is cheap so I guess the means of production of the dvd's followed suit. Thus the old adage, ""You get what you pay for"" is true. I'm returning the merchandise for a full refund. I plan to buy Wire in the Blood one season at a time.

Interesting characters, quick action. A bit gruesome with the killings, I had to skip forward past the killings.
And what is up with the camera work? Endless refocusing, shifting from one face to another, zooming in & then out again. It's as annoying as ""shaky cam,"" a fad that ended finally after much protesting from watchers.
