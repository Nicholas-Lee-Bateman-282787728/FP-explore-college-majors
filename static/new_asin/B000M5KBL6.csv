Unfortunately, the video quality is horrible (some of these are taken from PAL masters, blended and converted to NTSC), audio quality is horrible (they didn't bother to replace the audio with CD audio), and, here's the kicker: IT CAME AS A BURNED DVD-R! Packaging was garbage (the label was printed by a home inkjet printer). This is not worth $5, let alone $20.",1268179200,6,448,4.6125
8166523,3,B000M5KBL6,"Not a review - just a notice that this is a DVD-R not a real DVD. Unfortunately my copy was damaged in transit - but the purple color gave away the format (DVD-R) - $20.00 for a burned DVD is ridiculous!
