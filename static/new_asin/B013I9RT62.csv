Here we see compassionate human beings giving all their love, care, and attention to orphaned animals -- often orphaned because of other human beings, sadly. For me, these stories not only emphasize the good that we can do for our fellow creatures, but how much good they do for us, in reminding us that we're all essentially the same. Most animals, particularly mammals, not only want & need food, shelter, security -- they also need love & affection. In the end, we're no different. And in watching the bonds between these orphaned baby animals & the people who give so much of themselves to help, we're also reminded of what really matters in this world. Every living creature is a unique individual, only here on this Earth for a brief moment in time, and equally deserving of decency & respect.

No doubt some will scoff at that suggestion, calling it soft-hearted, sentimental slop. To me, that simply exposes the gaping holes in their own damaged souls. No question but that life can be hard & unforgiving at times ... but that's all the more reason to do what we can to alleviate that harshness, if it's in our power to do so. The poet W. H. Auden once wrote: ""We must love one another or die."" I'd say that applies to other animals as well, not just  to ourselves. This lovely program richly illustrates how much we all have to gain by doing just that. Most highly recommended!",1444953600,2,1559,4.5053003533568905
8727893,5,B013I9RT62,"These animals are very lucky but we as human species are much luckier since we have those caring volunteers who dedicate their life, and I mean they dedicate every second of their life in helping and protecting wildlife when many other mentally disturb humans, kill it all with pleasure without any respect for BLUE PLANET. You will get to see four different marsupials where in the wild they are the most caring mothers in the animal world. The youngs are attached to their mothers day and night over a year, reared in their pouches where they can hear their mothers heart beat of and the warmth of a sweet home unlike any other home in any world. For that reason, it is a very touching interaction between surrogate human parents and those marsupial orphans. You will witness how important love and affection is in staying healthy and having a future, a worthy future. You will see how important it is not having stress in life. So watch this documentary with your kids since not only you will introduce the wildlife to your kids the way it really is in wild when it comes to families, your kids will be more dedicated in protecting the wild with their future in mind as one essential element of their own future. Furthermore not only you will enjoy your time with your kids watching this documentary, you may come to realize that you need less of stress in your life since after all in order for you to enjoy the fruits of your life not only you need to be around happy and healthy, you need to insure the same for the wildlife for a complete happy BLUE PLANET. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1443052800,2,1585,4.506944444444445
