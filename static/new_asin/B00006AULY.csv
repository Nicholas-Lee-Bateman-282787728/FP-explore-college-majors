7966505,5,B00006AULY,"Really good. If you are short on time, but still want to get a good core workout, this is the DVD for you. All you need is 20 min.",1412294400,,130,3.5172413793103448
7966506,4,B00006AULY,"While I agree with other reviewers that this is not a heart pumping, high intensity workout it is certainly NOT a waste of money.  I find this DVD quite effective and use it frequently as a warm up for yoga, Pilates, and higher intensity cardio workouts.  The routines are fun and easy to follow once you have done them once or twice.  Not being a dancer, I felt quite accomplished after mastering each routine.  I particularly like Lisa Wheeler's segment.  It's more challenging and organized than Tracy Mallet's (Tracy has a bent knee twist move which is a bit rough on my weak knees and on which she messes up some of her cues).

My biggest complaint about this DVD is that the Pilates ""cool downs"" are fairly worthless. The transition between the dance segment and the mat work is virtually nonexistent.  I only do the Pilates work when using this workout as a warm-up for more Pilates or yoga.

On days when I wake up in the morning and don't want to do ANYTHING this DVD motivates me with its light and fun moves, making it vastly more valuable than my most challenging and extensive workout that I can only bring myself to do once or twice a month.",1141084800,,1155,4.466666666666667
7966507,3,B00006AULY,"This 40-minute-long VHS is broken into two 20-minute workouts, true to its name. It is part of the series that is recorded from a syndicated TV show. Each 20-minute segment includes a brief warm-up, complete aerobics routine, some abwork and short stretch. The sections are led by two different instructors.

The first workout is a jazz dance followed by oblique abwork. The second workout is more of a flamenco-type dance with more pilates-based abdominal work. Both are very interesting and difficult enough to keep me engaged for awhile. It will take 3 or 4 watchings before I have the routines down. They aren't typical but once you get it (if you can), I'd imagine you'd feel pretty coordinated and graceful. The moves are not the typical ""grapevine"" or just a couple of plies as far as dance goes.

The music is provided live by studio musicians (mostly drums) and the backdrop is contemporary and pleasing. The fitness models are not underdressed and do occasionally make a mistake - setting you at ease to do the same. The only disconcerting thing about the workout was in the second half, the instructor was using the leg/side she was calling out. Usually instructors will call out what leg/side YOU should be using, a mirror image and thus the opposite of what they are using. A minor flaw, esp. since I was on the wrong leg half the time anyway.

There is room for modification here - you can remove some of the spins in favor of marching in place a couple steps, and when you kick back, you can remain firmly on the ground instead of jumping simultaneously.

I didn't break a good sweat - just a light one. That may change after I get used to the choreography and really get into it. I hope so. For 40 minutes of my time I expect to work - otherwise it's just wasted time.

I would do both of these as a full workout - as an intermediate/advanced fitness level, I would feel lacking if I just did one 20-minute workout that included the warm-up, cool-down, and stretch along with the aerobics.",1117929600,,2005,4.589385474860335
7966508,2,B00006AULY,"Agree with the other reviews.

Each dance segment is less than 20 minutes and does not get your heart pumping at all. When you get the choreography by the second viewing, the tape becomes pretty useless because of all the pauses in between to break down the steps.

This should have been a straight 40 minute dance cardio tape Lisa Wheeler looks like a good jazz teacher.

The floor work also does nothing either.

Very very disappointing, even a brisk walk would be a better warm-up, it's not even enough of a warm up before I do my Tae-Bo DVD.",1109462400,,545,4.42
7966509,3,B00006AULY,"I like dancey type stuff, so to me this was an ok buy. HOWEVER, I would NOT have been happy if I had not had any previous experience in choreographed dance. This is not for the beginner in fitness. This is not really even a full fledged fitness video. Its just a fun dance video, but not alot of real exercise to it. If you have never had one on one dance instruction before, do NOT buy this video.
Ok, here are a few observations for you, in addition to what I have stated above.
#1  The cover features 2 women who are not even in the video.
#2  The music is horrible.
#3  The first part of the video is the most fun. Atleast you can stand the instructor, and the moves are repeated enough that you can get a good grip on the movement. (atleast if you have had previous experience in dance)
...The 2nd part of the video should be avoided at all costs. The woman is SO... annoying that you'll want to jump through the screen and slap her silly. The routine isn't even all that fun.
For me it was worth it because I enjoyed the first part of the video. If I'm bored, I can pick up this video and just have fun. For serious exercise, I have several videos and pieces of equipment I can use. I would not use this for a workout.
So, keep your money if you are looking for a great workout or have little dance experience, or both.
If you want something light and fun to do, pick this up...
Its not a total loss, but not the best thing I ever bought either.
All in all, I give this 3 out of 5 stars.",1043366400,3,1493,4.02020202020202
7966510,3,B00006AULY,"I'm very keen on ""dance"" fitness. So I was very excited with ""The Method"" series which offer a combination jazz dance, toning, cardio workouts. Now this ""New Method"" looks like recycled home videos or videos that somebody taped off a TV show and decided to make a buck. By the time you start to sweat, the workouts are over.  This tape is good for warm-ups or for clock-watchers but it's definitely a step back for ""The Method"" franchise.",1039737600,2,438,4.615384615384615
7966511,3,B00006AULY,"The back of the package calls this ""two 20 minute workout segments"" that are ""fat burning"" and ""time efficient"" and provide users with ""the grace of a dancer"" and several other ""benefits."" This is an example of very creative marketing. The cardio segments are NOT 20 minutes each, they're not especially intense, and they're certainly no more fat burning than a good, brisk walk.
The DVD menu is divided into Workout One and Workout Two. The first is led by Lisa Wheeler (of Dance to Fitness) and consists of a short warm-up and about 13 minutes of dance. Wheeler teaches you a single dance routine using Spanish-inspired ballet and modern dance moves. This segment will probably get your heart moving after the first couple of minutes, although it's not very intense. The routine then abruptly cuts to a poorly-explained, much-too-short floor Pilates routine as a ""cool-down"".
The second workout is led by Tracey Mallet (of Cardio Boot Camp). She also teaches you a Spanish-inspired dance routine, and her ""warm-up"" teaches the first steps of the routine. This 15 or so minutes is followed by another low-key Pilates mat ""cool-down"". I usually skip both cool-downs and do my own.
Pros:
1. My heartrate did go up with these workouts, but only after a few sessions. I spent the first few viewings mostly walking in place trying to figure out what was going on.  Once I got it, I could up the intensity by really getting into the moves.
2. Both instructors seem to be having a good time. The other dancers are the same as in many of the other Method series, but they also seem to be enjoying themselves.
3. The routines are interesting and pretty fun. Definitely not a typical aerobics workout.
4. Jennifer Kries is blessedly absent from this DVD. I don't like her style or workouts, but Mallet and Wheeler are consistently interesting and effective. I have no idea why Kries in on the cover of the DVD, nor who the random other woman is on the cover with her. Go figure.
5. These workouts can conceivably be done in a small living room. You need space, but not nearly as much as in Dance to Fitness. If you do Cardio Boot Camp or Donna Richardson tapes in your living room, you should be fine.
Cons:
1. The workouts are much too short. Just when you get a good sweat going, it cuts to the floor work. Even doing the two dance segments back-to-back doesn't do it, since you get moving and then switch back to low-gear while Mallet slow-steps you through the first part of her routine.
2. The cool-downs are poorly done. They move too slowly and give amazingly little useful technique instruction. Pilates is useless without proper technique, and you won't get it here. Pilates beginners won't know how to do the exercises, and Pilates-experienced viewers won't get much out of the skimpy exercises.
3. The chapters function should be better used on the menus. You can choose Workout One or Two, then from those screens choose warm-up, main routine, or cool-down. Why not let you choose from all six options from one screen? Better yet, follow the Quickfix technique of letting us choose more than one segment to customize a workout. I might as well get the VHS tape.
4. There is absolutely no stretching. Dance to Fitness was much better for stretching and lengthening the body.
5. Some knowledge of dance is helpful. Previous knowledge of Pilates is essential for the matwork, but I've covered that. People who aren't used to some sort of dance routines might find this discouraging.
6.  The music has zero relation to the dance moves.  The same bongo drums you heard in Dance to Fitness are here, but they pretty much just keep the beat.  It would have been nice to have actual music to move to.
This DVD gets three stars from me simply because it's a nice way to vary my other workouts. If you want Pilates, choose Quickfix or one of the many other (non-Kries) workouts. If you want a good movement-oriented routine, Dance to Fitness is much better. For dance, New York City Ballet Workout. But if you just want some low-grade cardio work in short segments that's different from anything else you own, this one is a decent choice.",1032652800,26,4131,4.678129298486932
