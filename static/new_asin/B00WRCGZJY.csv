7149106,5,B00WRCGZJY,"I own the entire series and highly recommend this cop show that grows on you. Especially good for older viewers, and those who like to watch crime solved with intellect and skill lead by an older cop. Yes, he has younger help for the rugged take downs. Smart man. Some humor mixed in with the suspense. The good news is this is not the COMPLETE collection, just the beginning first seven seasons. Series 8 is being aired as I write this review, more of a recommendation to buy, as this show is one that never goes out of date, a long shelf life allowing multiple viewing times over the years, even when you know the outcome. Or like myself, I tend to forget, an advantage of an older viewer watching an aging cop.
Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby star and do it believably, even their partnership banter is delightful.",1505260800,,813,4.4630872483221475
7149107,4,B00WRCGZJY,We like the series.  The interior of one box is damaged (the bottom hinge smashed) which means we need to be careful when removing and storing the discs.  It does not affect the viewing of the discs I hope as that is the series we are going to start watching but is why we gave it a 4 instead of a 5.  I lived through the 60s but not in the UK.  Issues then portrayed are still relevant today!,1502323200,,393,3.9367088607594938

10/1/17 I would strongly suggest that you should purchase series 1-7 and enjoy playing the dvds several times in the future.  Martin Shaw is excellent in this series and the dvds are worth every penny. I am looking forward to the last of the series to be distributed in or around March of 2018.( number 8 )

8714009,5,B00WRCGZJY,"Martin Shaw is truly one of the best actors from Great Britain.  Excellent writing and very good acting.  Love how Gently puts John in his place.  John is such a male chauvinist and hopefully learns something over the eight series program.  Being a woman, really enjoyed the addition of Rachel and her strong growth in her character (especially in those times).  Wonderful how perceptive she was and appreciated Gently's encouragement.  Very sorry to see George Gently series end.  Highly recommend this collection.",1518739200,2,515,5.2073170731707314

8714012,5,B00WRCGZJY,"This is a terrific series. The quality of each episode is excellent, with great screenplays, wonderful supporting actors - and Lee Ingleby is sensationally good. This is possibly the best series of its kind. Nothing not to love here. Buy the entire boxed set - you won't regret it!",1517961600,,281,4.755102040816326
8714013,5,B00WRCGZJY,I love the series but when we got the package and started watching we found that series 6 package was empty.  There was not a disk in the case so we do not know what happened in series 6.  would you please send me series 6.,1514937600,,223,3.8260869565217392

8714017,5,B00WRCGZJY,We are enjoying this DVD series very much.  We have 3 discs yet to finish Series 7.  It is fun to see John go through maturing and perhaps become more tolerable as he gets life's lessons from George Gently.,1509235200,,206,4.256410256410256
