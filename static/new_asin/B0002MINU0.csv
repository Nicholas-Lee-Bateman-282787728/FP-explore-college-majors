2105170,5,B0002MINU0,"Aikido is a harmonious system of defense which blends with the movements of an attacker to bring about his downfall.  This is a step by step teaching guide to Aikido with a leading Chinese instructor.  Contents include warm ups, Shikko (knee walking), techniques from a kneeling position, bowing etiquette, techniques of parrying, hitting, locking and throwing, breakfalling training done gradually, the basic 17 Randori no Kata - essential for all beginners, the counters to the basic 17, free practice, advanced balance breaking (Sichihon no Kuzushi), training with a safe rubber knife (Tanto Randori).

A brief illustrated history of the art is included with photographs of Morihei Uyeshiba and unique early photographs of his contemporaneous Japan.

Techniques are shown at normal speed, slow motion and freeze frames so that students can see how a technique should look when it is completed.  The video closely follows the Aikido training program.

2105172,4,B0002MINU0,"Well, the video is structured very good with a nice content index. You can navigate to find the section you want to review in easy format. Seems like a good intro for beginner with no experience. However, the demonstrations may differ from other schools. I understand that this style comes from the Tomiki branch of aikido. So, if you follow the Aikikai or other there will be differences.",1367971200,2,389,4.735294117647059
2105173,5,B0002MINU0,"""The Art of Aikido""

This is an excellent video for anyone. It does Kenji Tomiki Aikido justice. The martial artists performing the techniques do a very good job of making it possible for the person watching the video to digest the content. If you are a beginner or an intermediate practitioner of this form of aikido you will enjoy this video. This video is not a substitution for an actual instructor providing proper teaching. This video is a great help when it comes to reviewing and working things out in one's own personal training. In Aikido, you need other students to really appreciate the value of the art. As an instructor, I use it to remind myself of things I need to do, or if there is something I should not be doing it will show up after reflecting. I also encourage my students to view this video. It contains plenty of simplicity and offers a continuity of understandability even for young students.

A negative to this video, is when they slow down the movements, the sound also slows down and there is an annoying echo associated with the video footage. This is my only negative comment.

2105174,4,B0002MINU0,"This disk played fine for me.  I just started taking Aikido, and this disk allows me to see at my own pace the techniques of the movements.  In class, it's done so quick, this gives me the chance to study the footwork and movements at a slower speed and understanding of how it is done.

It does show the various techniques. I would have liked more content and explanation, but I'm pleased with the video. I feel good about this purchase.",1197244800,2,293,4.157894736842105

2105178,1,B0002MINU0,"First, this disk would not play on my DVD player.  It would only work on my computer.

Second, this disc briefly mentions that it illustrates the Tomiki branch of Aikido, which uses very different terminology and basic techniques than the more prevalent styles of Aikido.

Third, there is very little information of how most of the demonstrated techniques actually work. (Note carefully: these techniques are DEMONSTRATED, not taught.)  The concept of ""breaking balance,"" is briefly mentioned at the end of the DVD, but is never related back to the basic techniques demonstrated.

Last; the websites mentioned on the disc no longer seem to have any information about Aikido.

If you want to learn something about Aikido, go to a local Dojo, watch a training session, and talk to the sensei.  Then use the money you'd pay for this DVD for an introductory lesson.",1183248000,7,861,4.979020979020979
2105179,1,B0002MINU0,I ordered my first copy and found that the DVD did not work.  I contacted Amazon and they were great taking care of the return.  I requested a replacement copy and it arrived with more scratches then I've seen on most rental DVD's.  Surprise surprise the second copy did not work either.  It appears quality control has not been high on the producers list.  Do you think the third time could be a charm?,1130716800,11,403,4.391891891891892

8029408,2,B0002MINU0,"This gives you a reasonable but limited explanation of Aikido, It gives you a good understanding of the history of the martial art and its founder and gives you a broad outline of the practice. It doesnt however give  you any understanding of techniques beyond visual examples with little explanation as to their design and intent, If you are interested in a general understanding of Aikido, this works well enough. But if you are already an akidoist looking for good examples of techniques with good explanations, look elsewhere. Utube seems to me to be the only source for this, unfortunately.
