7200648,4,B00XVJ3L4E,This movie was worth watching....  Enjoyed it with my family and this movie promted great family discussions.,1438819200,11,109,5.411764705882353
7200649,5,B00XVJ3L4E,A wonderful movie about forgiveness and redemption.  A film no one should pass up.  Action from start to finish with no lags. It will capture you and stay with you for a long time. A classic.,1438387200,12,191,4.277777777777778
7200650,3,B00XVJ3L4E,"In the small town of Aledo Texas, a group of young white males decide to burn out an African-American family that opened a store in town. The wife and children die, as Jake (Bill McAdams Jr.) who was a reluctant participant becomes the next target of the Cain family which includes the sheriff.

The film is about forgiveness, redemption, and inner strength. The plot seemed forced and far fetched in the fact that no one went outside of the town to ask for an investigation with two eye witnesses. And after Jake rolls his truck, a few days later he is driving it from the hospital and it doesn't have a scratch.  The acting is on par with faith based films, although the religious part was minimal.",1437782400,7,700,4.503937007874016

7200654,5,B00XVJ3L4E,"This movie, ""Gallows Road"" showed the ugliest traits of men and how through forgiveness there is redemption and restoration for the ones wronged. It also shows how corruption when left unchecked and unchallenged changes the landscape of a town and its people. The end result was victory for the ""good guys.""",1503705600,2,307,5.03921568627451

7200656,4,B00XVJ3L4E,"huh, some of the reviews are interesting... I honestly don't know where they get the *poor acting* from. Who? or Which actor/s? Anyway.... how 'bout that Church Band/Choir?! It's a bit ridiculous how good they were. ah well, it's a movie. And by chance there may actually be a Church Band out there that actually is this good. Well, they're in this movie. ha ha
I think the story line was great, and everything was well written. Like I was saying, I don't know what the poor reviews are all about.
The reason I took off a star is because I do not believe in killing under any circumstances. I normally don't knock off a star for this, or maybe I do, don't remember, but maybe I should for now on. Other than this, I think the movie turned out pretty well.",1498953600,,755,4.323943661971831

7200658,2,B00XVJ3L4E,"I have to disagree with those who think this is a family movie.  There is a little more than forgiveness going on here.  Justice is not served in this movie.  There is a crooked Sheriff protecting his delinquent nephews.  They end the movie with out letting us know that justice was served in regards to the vicious, unlawful things that were done to the main character of this movie.  It also makes the town of Aledo Texas (and TEXAS) look bad.  Not a fan of crooked sheriff movies.  Just my opinion.  I do not recommend this movie.",1495152000,,533,4.422680412371134

7200701,4,B00XVJ3L4E,"Good movie, suitable for family. Bob's nephew Bay, and brother Seth, were the only one's a little stiff with their acting; otherwise, they all did a great job, and came across as convincing. Christian films are finally beginning to be made with quality; it also has a good story line and is filmed on location in Aledo TX. I thought it was nice touch, having Aledo's real mayor do a cameo. Frank was extremely patient and understanding; I have met bosses like that, and they are rare. As for editing: the scene where Snake talks with his father should have been left in the final cut. I don't think it elicits sympathy for him, but understanding, as to why he and Matty turned out the way they did, and how Snake earned his moniker. The action and fx are believable, and I was surprised when Bob killed the bully, like the snake he was.  The deleted alternate ending did belong on the cutting room floor, as it was very weak. HOWEVER, things didn't get wrapped up as I expected. It would've been satisfying to see the corrupt sherriff get arrested, and nothing was mentioned about Bob's deed, so I assume he was cleared of anything illegal. Frank's explanation of the movies' title was very chilling, and woke Jake up, who was numb from guilt. Like I said, Christian movies are improving, but still lack the big bucks to advertise and compete against the gilded trash showing in theaters.",1447804800,13,1388,4.596774193548387

I enjoy faith based movies because they offer plenty of entertainment, very low levels of violence, clean language, and usually deliver a clear, meaningful message; things missing from the majority of entertainment in our modern world.",1443916800,,491,5.1125

7200718,1,B00XVJ3L4E,"This movie is well acted but poorly written. At best it is ecumenical in the sense that it portrays a god. However, forgiveness is presented in this movie without Jesus Christ (not even mentioned) who said, ""I am the way, the Truth, and Life, NO ONE comes to the Father except through Me.""
Despite how well intended these movie producers are they place on film a false concept of forgiveness by creating the illusion that it can be obtained apart from the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ--The Son of God.

Conclusion: Don't waste your money or your time on this one.",1443484800,19,581,4.640776699029126

I've enjoyed other Ernie Hudson movies and have really liked other Kevin Sorbo movies (who was only in the film for a few minutes). This one was nothing like their other films I've seen. I hate to be negative but this film had no real point or direction. It was filled with cliche story points that barely tied together.
Kevin Sorbo is barely in the film at all. I really enjoyed the parts where he was there but it's just not enough to make this film worthwhile.
If you're a fan of Ernie Hudson or Kevin Sorbo, I'd encourage you to skip this one and check out their other work.",1442880000,12,615,4.356521739130435

Faith is not an achievement; it's something you commit yourself to anew every moment of your life, with every challenge, every stumble. Gallows Road offers the perfect storm of challenges and tests for its characters. And, through their struggle to balance the raw emotional need for revenge against the spiritual need for redemption, the film demonstrates the power of forgiveness to bring us closer to each other, and to God. A powerful and inspiring message. A compelling and important film. Five stars.",1442448000,8,735,5.159663865546219

I'm not sure what movie most of you were watching but this movie has flaws in several places: (1) no mother, especially a black mother, would leave her husband in a situation like that without going inside and getting something to fight with. It just wouldn't happen; (2) Any woman would have thrown her children out of the window and not let them die in the fire. She would have jumped out as well. She would not have just sat on the bed screaming; (3) When was this movie supposed to take place, in the 1930's? A family is killed, everybody in the town knows and no one calls the FBI, a higher authority and all the Pastor can say is forgive? As a Christian myself I would forgive with justice that makes more sense. Sometimes these Faith films make Christians seem illogical. No one is talking about calling in an investigation team they're just talking about forgiveness. That is not realistic; (4) We love Ernie Hudson and Kevin Sorbo but they were not used to full effect in this film; and (5) What happened to the Sheriff? How could you not resolve the most important storyline? Watch if you want but we could have watched another film.",1530921600,,1219,4.495495495495495
