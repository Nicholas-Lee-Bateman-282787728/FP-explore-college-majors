Die Schone Mullerin likewise but some of the notes are sung a little off key but this improves as the work progresses. One must make allowances for maturity.
A must for anyone who appreciates the format.",1467417600,,349,4.645161290322581

8541836,5,B009IF13RW,"Die Schone Mullerine is my favourite schubert song cycle. The concert was made a few weeks before Deitrich retired from singing but I  think was thrilling. Not only did he have great dynamics and expression in the voice but his facial expression is worth lookind at as well. I was moved almost to tears with this performance.
Winterreise was done earlier and is also a great performance. He seems to get everthing possible out of this music.
I cannot recomend these DVD's to highly.
I don't think you could get better value for money .
