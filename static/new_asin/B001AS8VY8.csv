8279375,5,B001AS8VY8,"As a Laurel and Hardy fanatic! I have acquired all 9 volumes of this rather pricey collection, but in my opinion it was money well spent. I am from the UK and own the Universal and the Kinowelt collections. In regard to the silents although the remastering is overall better upgraded and cleaner and sharper on the European sets and a number include more footage than the ""Lost"" set I believe that the ""Lost"" collection is sourced from the same quality sources and in a number of cases better prints. The Kinowelt set does include the original Vitaphone soundtrack for the short We Faw Down, which ""Lost"" and the Universal sets do not. The ""Lost"" collection also wins as it has the majority of the surviving original Vitophone soundtracks for the films and even a few foreign soundtracks made for some of their earlier shorts which is a nice bonus. There are one or two shorts, namely 'Should Married Men Go Home' and 'We Faw Down' which feature missing footage that the other two sets do not. Plus most of the films are presented with their original Titles and intertitles. Overall if the ""Lost"" set had had the missing footage that does exist added to certain films, like 'Love 'Em and Weep' for example and had the Vitaphone soundtrack added to 'We Fae Down' and underwent a better digital remastering and restoration, this would be the undesputed set for Laurel and Hardy's silent comedies. I still overall prefer this set and am delighted to have obtained all 9 volumes, happy days!",1365552000,6,1487,4.7011494252873565
