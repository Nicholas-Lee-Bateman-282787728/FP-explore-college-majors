The picture on the cover had nothing to do with the movie, which is a good thing, as you can guess if the characters were walking around w swords and guns, it would probably earn one star.  Decent story line, good acting. Yes.  3.2 stars.  Watch it.",1463356800,,340,4.090909090909091

5724571,4,B00CJLQHC8,Not your typical assassin-themed movie where it's all about the hit. This movie focuses more on the internal conflict and psychological cost of being an assassin.,1461024000,,162,5.269230769230769

5724573,5,B00CJLQHC8,"Excellent acting with a layered plot, intelligent dialogue, dirty deeds and a fantastic soundtrack. Assassins develop consciences and debate their jobs as mobsters, hitmen and crime bosses pull strings. Amazing performances from a cast that was largely unknown to me.

5724575,5,B00CJLQHC8,"ANNA SILK IS MY ALL-TIME FAVE ACTRESS- I liked the supporting actors who did excellent jobs of course.  LOVE to SEE black actors WHO SPEAK REAL English- no slurring and no 'idiot' slang'. IT is a shame the USA IS STILL DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN MAKING EVERYONE black 'a new time slave who mumbles and looks sloppy and dresses like a clown from stupid wigs to stupid duds to stupid 'BAMMER LINGO'..  The black population of the USA needs to turn their back on the EVERYONE CREATING MOVIES THAT MAKE all of us feel that keeping us down is the main agenda and collectively working to disrespect /misrepresent and shame everyone who has gotten an education and tried to improve the live of both rich and poor minority kids, adult, and immigrants.

5724578,3,B00CJLQHC8,"Entertaining, but uneven.  Uneven pacing, dialogue, and acting at times, but still some good performances.  I got this as an Anna Silk fan, and don't regret it, but it seems like it could have been better.  The worst part of the whole movie, though, was the soundtrack.  For me, a good soundtrack can elevate a subpar movie into something I watch multiple times.  This soundtrack made it difficult to get through the whole movie once, definitely a solid star off the review for that alone.",1453766400,,489,4.705882352941177

5724587,5,B00CJLQHC8,"This film is excellent, with many twists and turns. It is, however, a bit of a different perspective, in that it is a tale about the lives ( and deaths ) of an assassin society. Not being of this society's mindset, I never can know what to expect next. A wonderful soundtrack accompanies this great film. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, which was refreshingly different. It even has a LOL! moment. I'm not telling you where, but after a twist I LOL! So, I am adding a touch of suspense.",1387411200,5,487,4.4222222222222225
5724588,3,B00CJLQHC8,"Carlos Manfeddy dies and leaves his crime empire to his son and an illegitimate son.  Carlos jr. hires Jason (Rob Roy Fitzgerald) to have his people perform the hit on the illegitimate son to insure he doesn't have to share anything. The problem is no one exactly what he looks like, but there are pictures of several people who might be his son. The man carrying the pictures gets killed by Woody's (Kaiwi Lyman) assassins who takes the pics and hunts down the illegitimate son on his own for the money. Of course there is a lot of double cross and plot twists.

On the surface the plot isn't that great. The film reminded me of a low budget poorly scripted ""Smokin' Aces"" without the over the top characters and humor. On the plus side, was the sound track which featured a few good original songs. The film had some good scenes, but like the acting, it was spotty. This is a low budget, low action crime movie that attempts to deal with characters coming to terms with their occupation, i.e. killing innocent strangers may be wrong.

It was okay as a lower tier rental. Writer/director Arthur Louis Fuller doesn't appear to have reached his potential.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, token nude scene.",1376265600,3,1202,4.629107981220657
5724589,5,B00CJLQHC8,"Assassins Tale is about deceit and betrayal versus loyalty and trust.  This is a dark, gritty film, with characters that live and work at the margins of society.  Deceit brings out the worst in them, whereas loyalty eventually provides their redemption.  The cast gives us excellent performances, in their portrayal of these layered characters.  We also benefit from, skillful directing and well written dialogue.  It is an engaging story with surprising twists.  So, as other reviewers suggest, pay close attention or you might miss something.  Yes this is a movie whose characters are assassins, but it certainly is not just another run-of-the-mill movie about assassins shooting at other people and blowing things up.  Definitely worth watching.  To Amazon and MTI Home Video: I wish Assassins Tale were available in the more convenient digital/streaming video format, not just via DVD.",1376179200,,889,5.338129496402877

The part that was the worst for me was how often they had a song that was probably composed by the director's brother's band. In the first hour, I thought I was watching a musical. The plot was horrible and there was not enough action to make up for it. But it was free with Prime so it gets 2 stars.",1472688000,,391,3.962025316455696
