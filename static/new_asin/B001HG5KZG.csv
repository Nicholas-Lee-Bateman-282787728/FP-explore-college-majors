8543818,5,B001HG5KZG,I received the box set yesterday and was pleasantly surprised.  The box set is NEW and is still sealed with cellophane.  Nowhere in the product description is its condition stated.  I already have Snow White on a 1 laserdisc in CLV so I am in no hurry to open the box set.  I will keep it sealed for now.,1467072000,,304,4.101694915254237
8543819,5,B001HG5KZG,"SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is Walt Disney's cinematic treasure, a story undiminished by its age and now restored once again to the highest technical standards available. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was the first of many Disney feature films noted for their great emotional power. Although enthusiasts of the Grimm version have criticized Disney's retelling as being too cute and maudlin, the film does contain some genuinely fear-inspiring moments and parents should be cautious about having smaller children view this film. My daughter is a teenager and she still can not watch it. The animation is powerful and consuming. In a true visual representation of the confrontation of good and evil, the climactic chase of the queen by the dwarfs brilliantly demonstrates the power of animation. The coloring of the heavens, the shadows, the falling boulders, and the two apocalyptic vultures that lurk above, swooping downward after the queen plunges to her doom are all well conceived indelible images of the forces of evil being vanquished. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a classic film. It is an outstanding example of the wonder and brilliance of Walt Disney's animation, and a technical milestone. It is an icon in the history of all cinema let alone animated cinema. Concerning the restoration of the film this time around I found the audio restoration incredible. For a film that old, the sound especially the score sounded brilliant.

The hard cover book that comes in the box is very beautiful. I really liked the ""Making Of"" disc that is also included. It is very good. This is an essential Laserdisc Edition. The animation is so haunting.",1415577600,,1658,5.007246376811594
