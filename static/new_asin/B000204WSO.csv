8019345,3,B000204WSO,"Since I was not familiar with the Watchword series, Mark's Gospel is a short introduction. The scriptures are presented on the screen with pleasant (sometimes blurred) backgrounds for each verse. This is not the much anticipated Visual Bible series Gospel of Mark that was advertised at the end of the VB Gospel of John. The series would benefit someone who needed to have the Gospel read to them at a slower pace than audiotapes and the visually handicapped could watch the scenes on a large screen TV /monitor.",1150243200,26,512,4.829545454545454

For the broadest reach it uses the Contemporary English Version.

MARK
Beginning with the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by John the Baptist, Mark is packed with stories that demonstrate Jesus really is the Son of God - with power over death, disease and the devil. Because Jesus spoke and acted with divine authority, his ministry amazed his followers and the crowds who were with him. His parables and teachings filled them with wonder as Jesus taught about God and his kingdom.
Inspiring original music was composed to underscore the entire production. Mark can be watched and read word-for-word in only two hours. (Part One: 64 min. / Part Two: 60 min.) DVD Region:Region 1 - USA and Canada Only",1099958400,22,939,4.725609756097561
