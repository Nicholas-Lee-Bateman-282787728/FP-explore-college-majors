961143,2,6305053987,"I got this DVD in the hope that I could replace one or two VHS tapes from my collection. After seeing it, I'll certainly keep the tapes around. The picture is grainy as if it had been taped from a station with poor reception.
As for the DVD contents, I wouldn't call this 'the best'. I have watched every episode from the wonder years, and while I admit it has one of the best finales from the history of TV (in my opinion, obviously), there were other episodes that deserved to make the best.
Also, the DVD only has 71 minutes. They could at least fill it up. The pilot would have been nice to have, maybe a few minutes with the scenes of the now famous guest stars, or a small 'where are they now' of the cast...something that makes a difference with a home made collection.
In short: If you have the episodes on tapes, don't buy this DVD. If you are going to buy a new DVD player and want to check its picture quality, don't buy this DVD. Of course if you like good TV and don't care much about anything else, well, the wonder years was a great show.",1007856000,305,1053,4.166666666666667
961144,4,6305053987,"This is a really good program and I was waiting for this to come out on DVD, although there is not much content. The program ran for 7 series and they only managed to put two episodes and 10 minutes of other material on this disk. I do not know what they were thinking by doing this.  Although the one up side is that the quality of the DVD is really good costidering that LazerLight is never heard of and the program is really old. So I am not sure why everyone is complaining about the quality. Becasue you have to think about how old the show is and then you see that the quality is really very good.
I really hope that they release some more wonder years material on DVD.",997056000,9,675,4.113636363636363
961145,2,6305053987,"I would have started out this review by saying that ""LaserLight"" should be ashamed for putting something like this out, but then I realized I have never heard of ""LaserLight"" and DVDs of this quality may very well explain why.  I am a closet Wonder Years fan, and I was eagerly anticipating this ""Best of"" compilation.  Unfortunately, all the reviews before mine accurately sum up every one of the faults of this DVD.  The disc only has one episode on it, with a ""Highlights"" section preceding this lonely episode to round out the paltry 71 minutes of material.  Admittedly, I found that the editing done during the ""Highlights"" portion was accomplished reasonably well, with no harsh jumps or obvious transition flaws.  The section does not, however, lay any type of background down about the show or its characters before sending the viewer off to the Series Finale.  Tech. wise my biggest complaint was the audio, it was atrocious.  A TV show of this caliber deserves so much more and I can only hope that at some point (in the near future?) a company goes back and does it justice, for this DVD surely doesn't.",995414400,204,1114,4.711340206185567
961146,1,6305053987,"I'm a huge fan of the Wonder Years, and have most of them on tape recorded from Nik at night.  Some are very depressing, but still great to watch.  This DVD contains a clip show and the series finale.  The finale is a great double episode, but horrible quality and awful changes ruin it.  To my astonishment the theme from 'The Natural' has been cut out of the final scene.  A similar generic flute solo replaces it.  This completely takes away from emotion and importance of the ending.  Also, when Kevin drives to meet Winnie at the country club, CCR's 'Up Around the Bend' is replaced by some generic sound-alike song.  Did they lose the rights to these songs or something?  Plus the sound needs to be turned way up to hear the dialog, thus static is heard throughout.  It's even hard to recognize 'With a Little Help From My Friends' during the intro because of extreme mono.  To tell you how bad the picture is, during Kevin and Winnie's first kiss, the color flashes between twilight and nighttime.  And during a scene in the school hallway, everyone turns kind of blue for a split second.  I hope no one sees the finale for the first time in this version, because you wouldn't even think it's that good.  The reviewer from Canada must have a black and white TV with one speaker not to recognize this horrible quality.  It's like someone took the original version, put it through a trash compactor, eliminated the best songs, and then put it on a DVD to fully expose its distortion.  I recommend watching recorded VHS versions (even extended play) because they sound better, look better, and haven't been tampered with.",977270400,50,1625,4.609756097560975
961147,3,6305053987,"Other viewers are right...appears to be grainy and transfered from video  tape. Surely slapped together by some third-rate post house.  You do get  the final episode in it's complete form but the highlights do little in  explaining the series to the unfamiliar.  However, seeing this series once  again more than makes up for the faults. If you grew up in the sixties,  went to school, met a girl and held a job this show will do more for  bringing back all the emotions, feelings, sights, sounds, and wonder of  that era and make you wish you were still wondering all over again...",966297600,11,582,4.627450980392157
961179,2,6305053987,I have read that the Wonder Years will never be put on DVD because there is so much music in the series and a company would have to get the rights to every piece of music on the show in order to put it on DVD and that will probably never happen.,1317081600,2,245,3.730769230769231

961182,5,6305053987,"Hi
My name is Paula Bettencourt.
I am a fellow fan of the Wonder years .
I've been trying to contact Fox about this issue. Fore some time now.
I finally did get to speak with a Fox associate.
I told the young man that I spoke with on the phone.
That if fox releases the Wonder years on DVD that I would buy it with bells on.
And I think that the Wonder years is quite possibly the best show that Fox ever produced.
And that it should atleast be put back on  television if not on DVD.
.
And that if they wanted to stop the bootleggers in their tracks.
That they should just do whatever it takes to get the show out on DVD.
He responded by saying that He has been employed their for a year and I'm the first person that he spoke with.
That requested the Wonder years on DVD.
I told him that I see posts on the net all the time .From desperate consumers.
Begging for the Wonder years on DVD.

And that they get ripped off from these unscrupuledd bootlegger.
And the only reason people buy these bogus boxsets is that unfortunetly  !!!
Thats the only way fans of the Wonder years have left to see this wonderful show.
And that is a real shame !!!!!!
And He told Me that if Fox receives enough requests that they might .
Be willing to pay the high music rights costs to get the Wonder years out on DVD.
So My point is this.
If My fellow Wonder years fans want to see this magnifacent show on DVD.
They should call this number that I was finally able to find.
The phone number for twentieth century fox home entertainment is 18773697867
Lets try and flood this number with calls and hound fox into putting the Wonder years on DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!
YEA !!! PEOPLE !!!",1273536000,7,1656,4.1526479750778815
961183,1,6305053987,"As said many times before this post, any DVD release is based on weather ABC can secure the music rights. The problem is petty arguments with the many separate music right's holders who each demand insane amounts of money for each individual song. If these ""holders"" used the intelligent area of their brains for a moment they might realize their faults. Their faults in not allowing the music, under their ""control,"" be used to make the Wonder Years alive and whole again. To allow the show to be archived and distributed around the world for all old and young to watch again or for the first time on DVD and hopefully Blue-ray.
  This would not only renew interest with the music contained in all 115 episodes {that's quite a few songs} but also make these ""holders"" a hefty amount of money due to the exposure alone. To make a far too long ""review"" short. Copyright holders of all these great songs, stop acting like children in suites. Let the music be.",1240617600,3,957,4.590643274853801
961184,5,6305053987,"I am borrowing the title of a Walt Whitman poem to sum up my views of this terrific series from the late 1980s, in which Baby Boomer, Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) recounts coming of age during the turbulent 60s.
 With the help of his father(Dan Lauria), mother (Alley Mills), his Flower-child big sister(Olivia D'Abo), and pesky brother (Jason Hervey), as well as his best friends Paul Pfeiffer(Josh Saviano), and Winnie Cooper(Danica McKellar), we see how Kevin's world is affected by dilemmas and experiences of the young in any given time period, as well as how his life is dramatically impacted by the social changes unique to the 1960s and early 70s in a saga that alternates between humor, sadness, and endearment, capped by the narration of Daniel Stern as the adult Kevin.
  I remember this series fondly, and as Kevin gave the summaries of a life lesson gleaned by the end of the show, I always contemplated the truth of Walt Whitman's words about how his experiences and the people in his life all became a part of him. Whitman himself may have enjoyed this series.",1205971200,,1073,4.758064516129032

I also find it to be a very unproductive business move to prolong the release of this fantatsic series.  The amount  of people that would rush to get a copy would be unbelievable.  The people who connected with the show make up a large percentage of the market.  Needless to say this release is long OVERDUE!!!!!!!  Come On!",1144972800,11,643,4.38135593220339

Not only is it poor in every sense of the word (length, episode selection, audio and visual quality, extras, and packaging are all sub par even for 1999), it's out of print and thus very, very expensive!

In a world where you can buy the complete He-Man and Knight Rider anthologies at Target, there isn't a season-based DVD set for one of the most memorable and quality shows of the last 30 years? I mean, we have Thundercats seasons on DVD now, but no Wonder Years? It's almost like they're doing it to spite me, personally...except I know from my time in college that basically anyone born between 1970 and 1985 connected to that show in such a deep and primal way that if I went up to a random 20-something on the street and said ""Winnie Cooper,"" their eyes would light up and they'd get chills.

Here is an excerpt from Fox "" This issue of Entertainment Weekly quotes Fox Home Entertainment's Senior Vice President of Marketing & Communications, Mr. Steve Feldstein, as saying ""We've got it on the schedule, but there are hurdles to clear prior to a firm release date.""

""On the schedule"" sounds pretty good to us, how about you? In all likelihood, the ""hurdles"" would start with all the music licensing that would have to occur in order to present the show on DVD the same way it was originally broadcast. According to the EW story, that is precisely the way the people who were behind the production of The Wonder Years wants to see these episodes brought home. Us too, and we're sure we speak for most of you as well. It will be worth waiting a little bit longer (and even paying a little bit more, like with Freaks and Geeks) to get this the way it *should* be seen.

I knew it was a bootleg because the disc's were solid white and had a cheap looking font writing on them. All it said was Disc 1, 2,etc. But I loved the show so much I didn't care. Especially since the price was a tiny $39.00. Also the the lower right corner of every episode had the ""ABC Family"" logo. I guess the Chinese used their satellites to download the show many years ago and mass produce it on DVD later. Anyway.

In seasons 1&2 the images were a bit sandy but quickly forgotten because of the show itself. ALL of the DVDs played till the very last episode. The video and sound quality improved in the later seasons. It was a treat for me because I have never seen the final episode. I am proud to say that it is my favorite TV show of all time.

I would post a link to the site but I think Amazon would not like that.

7882300,5,6305053987,As of October 2011 the whole series can be streamed on Netflix.  While I have been angry with Netflix about their pricing baloney as of late this is a big score for them.  I say watch it there and save the money you would spend on this.,1317686400,2,236,4.0
