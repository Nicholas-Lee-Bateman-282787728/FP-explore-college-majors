8500721,3,B006MGUTQQ,"I really want to like this more, but he spends a LOT of initial time going over all his custom hot-key palettes, which he doesn't provide ANY FILES for. As a result, so I could keep up with him later, I had to keep freeze-framing the video so that I could try and recreate all his custom UI and hotkey settings  which took hours of fiddling. And there's still some buttons on his UI that he never named, and I simply can't find anywhere the thousands of interface do-dads that ZBrush has.

Really... If you're making a video for novices, USE THE DEFAULT INTERFACE AND HOTKEYS. Or provide the custom UI files that you're using on the disk! Make it easy to keep up with you in other words!

Frankly I spent so much time trying to re-create his interface that I ran out of time to actually follow along with more than a small fraction of the video.",1469318400,,845,4.30188679245283
8500722,2,B006MGUTQQ,"This is beyond intimidating.  Each step you will spend hours and even days, and at some points weeks, trying to get some of these functions to work as he did.  Masking will be a nightmare, and trust me, there's a lot of it.  When he extracts at 1, my thickness did not match, and were enormous.  Basically, if you are using Zbrush 4R6, skip this. You'll just get frustrated and give yup by the second video...... like I did.",1389225600,,424,4.329113924050633
8500723,5,B006MGUTQQ,"This tutorial could be somewhat intimidating to new users because of the speed at which Mike Jensen goes (not a complaint).  So it would help if you familiarize yourself with the ZBrush UI first.  That said, Mike Jensen does go over customizing the UI for this tutorial, which I think is great.  Now, he is very very good!  He knows ZBrush and knows how to make best use of the brushes and other utilities.  His explanations are thorough and easily followed (don't forget, you can pause).  I am completely knew to ZBrush and I am NOT having a difficult time following the explanations.  As quickly as Mike Jensen goes, he explains each step very well.  I plan on viewing the course first (no ZBrush) so I know what to expect when I actually open ZBrush up and follow along.  Although, it is a lengthy at course 7.5 hours, I can understand why, as it is a very detailed sculpt, and completely appreciate the time Mike has put into this tutorial.  I highly recommend this to anyone, new or advanced.  Lastly, Amazon as always, go this to me in a speedy 3 days.",1360022400,,1058,4.458333333333333
