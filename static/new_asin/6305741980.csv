It was about Cool (Silkk the Shocker)who had dreams of being  a rapper and having a life with his girlfriend. Some how his girlfriend is  frame with murder and he goes under cover to try and bring down the real  suspects. Through his the things Cool goes through he ends up taking the  life of crime and putting together the Hot Boyz who were Snoop ,Mystikal  ,C-Murder ,and A.J. Johnson and they took over everything.

1062224,1,6305741980,"Ah, ""Hot Boyz,"" what pleasure do I owe you for writing this review? Nothing, except bashing this movie to no end because it deserves it.

I will be honest here. I have a strange thing for B-movies, especially the curiosity of movies starring rappers. Bare this in mind, there aren't a lot of ""rap movies"" that I have seen. One in particular was ""Thicker Than Water"" starring Mack 10 and Fat Joe. Now I remember watching that movie at the age of 14 and enjoying it and while I watched that a few years ago, I can admit how low budget it is and the acting was not great. What gave it a pass for me was decent writing, even though the viewing hasn't held up over time.

Now, as for ""Hot Boyz,"" I remember watching that on UPN at 14 as well and actually enjoying it. Fast forward to about a decade later, I am a lot older and wiser and I was able to see how much of a piece of crap this movie really is.

Let me just say this. I went through a No Limit phase at some point in my life. I was all into No Limit Records and even wanted to check out the movies that No Limit did. I have only seen ""I Got The Hook Up"" and ""Foolish,"" which were bad but have SOME redeeming qualities. ""Hot Boyz"" has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES WHATSOEVER! The movie had bad acting, bad writing and bad direction. It had every single cliche that you have seen before. Also, the drastic change in plot did the movie no favors at all. I really hated how they tried to make it seem like that girl was a suspect just because she was helping out a cop who was left to die and now she gets life? Let's not forget the fact that the movie was given a happy ending for the main character. Sentenced to 30 but only got five years? Why? Just to stick it to The Man?

I could go on about how horrible this movie is. NEVER WATCH THIS! However, if you want to punish someone, this movie is a great torture technique.",1371513600,,1869,4.070652173913044

1062226,5,6305741980,"In an underrated classic, Silkk the Shocker turns in his best Oscar-worth performances as Kool.

1062231,1,6305741980,"Hot Boyz, Except the Corvette Scene, the movie is really really bad, Not the worst of the NO Limit films,but bad. This was good when I went through my No Limit Phase(LOL) before they started to copy and bite too much and started to falloff.",1258416000,,240,4.355555555555555
1062232,1,6305741980,"First off, the acting in this movie was just soooooo ridiculous, it kind of reminded me of a crappy high school play. Actually, I take that back, the worst part of his movie wasn't the acting, but the directing. This is quite obvious during the scene when they formed their gang. After one of the gangsters comes up with the name ""hot boyz"" (btw, wtf kinda name is that?) they cut to each gang member who puts thier forty in for a toast and say ""hotboyz nigga."" When they finally get to snoop dog, you'll actually laugh when he says the phrase for the sixith time.

The second thing that made this move somewhat funny was the car chase scenes. If you notice the cars that crash when the chases occur, you'll see that they use the same stunt car arounf Five times in the same chase. It's just absolutely ridiculous, you see this old greyish car get smashed, the camera cuts to a different street, and you'll see the EXACT same car that was smashed three seconds ago.

The other thing that irritated me was how the gangsters took over the cocaine buisness, they simply shot every other dealer, which sounds fine, but they literally line up in front of a whole gang of other criminals, pull out their weapons and unload on them. The other criminals have automatic assault rifles, smgs, and hand guns, but of course not ONE of the hotboyz gets hit, not even a graze. All together, this movie sucked, if you want to see a good gangbanger movie, get gang tapes(my favorite), colors, or boyz in the hood cuz this one sucked.",1136592000,2,1517,4.453237410071942
1062233,1,6305741980,"I caught some of this movie on TV because nothing else was on.  It was OK I guess, the acting wasn't that good, but kept me entertained until Silk's girlfriend was arrested because they thought she stabbed that cop, eventhough she was just trying to help him.  After they arrested her, I turned the channel because framing movies piss me off.",1130803200,,342,4.590163934426229
1062254,3,6305741980,Master P directed this movie however he did not have a big  part of being in this movie that sucked. Silk wants to be a rapper his girlfriend is framed for murdering a cop. Silk does whatever he can to go undercover and clear his girlfriends name. The only time Silk acting was good in this movie was when he was in the hospital crying for real right before his girlfriend died. The action was not all that bad especially when Silk was in that car driving all around in circles away from the cops and land into the water.,1121904000,,521,4.21
1062255,1,6305741980,"This movie is poo. Bottomline. But its that funny poo thats only funny when one of your friends stepped in it. Idon't know where these people are getting off sayin that Master P has EVER had any good movies (Foolish was so-so at best). I saw this movie on TV and I was laughing my ass off! Even the ""sad"" parts are funny.

Everything else is predictable and the acting, oh my please please do not get on the acting.

If there were negative stars I would give this move a negative 10 or something. But if your high or drunk or just want a good laugh and a laugh that will make tears comming out your eyes check this out.

1062256,3,6305741980,"This film isn't a classic and it damn sure aint nowhere compared to ""Belly"", but it is watchable.  The main problem is the action.  This film would've been a story about love, loss, and revenge, but instead the story is almost unrecognizable because of all the long car chases, shootouts, and bad lines.  There are good parts though and that's mainly because of the effect it has on people.

The movie is made with cheap camera systems so the camera work might not be Hollywood-class, but the movie itself is very entertaining and SILKK THE SHOCKER is prob. the best actor in the NO LIMIT family...
A warning though to the people who wants to see it only becouse of SNOOP DOGG, his screentime is about the time that METHOD MAN had in belly and NAS had in TICKER so u can't really be thinking that I wanna watch it becouse Snoop is in it cuz he's not in it too much...

1062261,1,6305741980,"In the glory days of No Limit's rap franchise, Master P took ""overexposure"" to glorious new heights with this very stupid ""strugglin' in the hood"" tale.
Silk The Shocker (P's younger brother) is Kool, a self-proclaimed thug who turns to a life of crime when his girlfriend gets framed for a crime after witnessing a murder. What? Anyways, the story flip-flops all over the place, taking time to throw in every major cliche possible. Kool is an aspiring rapper who also practices martial arts and specializes in car chases. He tries to make a deal with Gary Busey's crooked cop but it doesn't work to his advantage.
After his girlfriend is murdered, and his subsquent careers as a martial artist, rapper, basketball player, and NASCAR driver fail, Kool joins up with a crew featuring No Limit rappers, Snoop Dogg, Mystikal, C-Murder, and comedian Anthony ""A.J."" Johnson. The crew nicknamed the ""Hot Boyz"" is a gang that murders major drug dealers in an attempt to take the drug game for themselves. Well, of course.
Once you hear the cheesy opening monolouge from Master P's overacting little bro, you know what you're getting into with this one. Master P's over-contrived script takes ""suspension of disbelief"" to brave new heights. In particular, many of the scenes involving Gary Busey's cop character make no sense. In one scene, Kool agrees to set up a major drug dealer played by veteran actor Clifton Powell. Before the situation unfolds, Busey murders a man in cold blood and threatens to blame it on Kool if he doesn't help him out. The motivation for any cop, no matter how crooked he is, to blackmail someone who has already agreed to help him out is non-existent. But wait it gets worse. After deciding to take on a life of crime, gangster Kool shows up at Busey's house and robs him of his entire gun collection. That's right. A police informant shows up at a cop's house with a pistol and robs in the middle of the day. There's a believable scenerio. Of course, at the end of the day, the drug-dealing gangster leaves a trail of dead bodies including rival drug dealers and decorated police officers but due to him ""having a good lawyer"", he doesn't end up in prison.
Master P the screenwriter is certainly trying hard but he ends up with Ed Wood results. This whole story is just awful. While it tries to play itself in the same veign as classic urban films such as BOYZ N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY, it could not be any more of a failure. Where those films showed a realistic portrait of ""black America"", this one is just going out of its way to take on every element of the action genre. Kool's outlaw attitude has no moral or truly negative outcome. He is just the ultimate black action cliche. ""Hot Boyz"" is certainly never boring but it seems to blast its way into a series of nonsensical situations before ending more ridicilously than it started.",1063152000,4,2871,4.653543307086614

1062319,5,6305741980,"Perhaps you have, at some point in your life, seen a movie that touches your heart, not because of its plot (though this film certainly is capable of that ) but because of hit deep personal significance? Well then you may have some vague concept of how I felt upon viewing this film for the first time.
First let me give you a little background about myself. I was born in Bowl Weevul, Nebraska. Perhaps you have heard of it? That's right, the same town infamous for its streets overrun with corruption and a police force at least as bad. Well I always dreamed of one day being a performance artist, but then 'tha game' caught up with me. Yes I ran with the bad crew, heck at one point I was in control of the entire illegal-reproduction-of-major-leauge-baseball-without-its-written-consent market. Then it all came crashing down and I was put into jail for 2 months, but I got out and now I have made a name for myself dancin for change... but that isn't the point.
This movie was almost an exact recreation of my life, save that there were black people in this movie.
If you can find me an actor today more capable of the dramatic range exhibited from Silkk Tha Shocker in this film, I would be quite surprised. Virtually the whole crew turn in stellar performances, from Snoop Dizzogz gun hard drinkin right hand man, to C-Murda's painful turn as a former friend turned snitch, to Mystikal reaching deep within to pull out a screaming fool. But the acting is not all that makes this film superb.
I have to give props to the second unit direction. They somehow managed to get that realistic explosion a body makes when hit by a bullet perfect. The car chase scenes were like something out of Ben-Hur, and dispite the stunt driver billing in the credits, I think Silkk may have done some of that driving himself, I have seen his music videos, and boy can he do a doughnut or two.
I must advocate you buys this movie, reader, for if you are truely to experiance the street-life, in all its double-barrelled, turbo-injected, coke-snortin', cash-flossin, glory, you can do no better than the gritty realism contained within.",984441600,2,2122,4.616402116402116
1062320,2,6305741980,"A boy (played by Silkk Shocker), with a strong sense of justice, fails to  save his beautiful girlfriend from being wrongfully imprisoned for a murder  she had no part in. Instead, he becomes a pawn in a lethal game between a  tough cop (Gary Busey) and a sinister underworld figure named Saint.  Eventually, when his girlfriend is beaten to death within the walls of the  jail and miscarries with their baby, he loses all faith in justice and  enters the drug business and swiftly acquires the credentials of a  certified gangster, before his own downfall. Hasn't this been done before  and better, as in the pictures of Mario van Peebles or the Hughes Brothers?  Unfortunately, there have been just as many films out of the 'hood as there  have been out of Vietnam, so hopefully filmmakers should learn pretty soon  to stop churning out the repetitive cut-and-dried stuff. ""Hoy  Boyz"" at least has the benefit of a few strong moments, a well-known  cast (including Snoop Dogg and Gary Busey -- possibly the most versatile  American actor ever) but it degenerates in the last minutes to becoming a  vehicle for sanctimonious moralising -- ""the good life"", and so  forth.",968544000,,1171,4.838383838383838
