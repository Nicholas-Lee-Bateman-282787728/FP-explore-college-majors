2616734,5,B000GRUVVA,"Love the DVD. Big fan of Trower. Not as easy as you think. Trower is Trower for a reason!
 Definetely some great info and gives you good close-up shots. A lot of fun to watch and try.
 He's not the best ""teacher"" but that's why he is not employed at a high School.
 Trower is awesome. HIGHLY RECOMMEND !  Wierd hair-do though.",1295913600,3,326,4.209677419354839
2616735,5,B000GRUVVA,"This offering was made at a local studio in Atlanta...The live concert scenes were filmed at the Center Stage Theatre in Midtown Atlanta in and around the late 80's where Robin was making his full fledged comeback, touring the US every year without stop....His currant touring band today is the same band he used then with Davey Pattison, Glenn Letsch, and Pete Thompson...

Trower's unique approach mostly involved his use of a dirty blues over-driven signal through a Uni-Vibe, giving him a overwhelmingly ""Big"" guitar sound: then using odd slow-paced chording, mysterious lyrics, and impassioned leads drawn from his ax that showed thru his facial expressions.....

Robin touches alot about his blues and R & B influences in his playing also....As well as his amp settings, tone controls and gear....All is included....All this coming from a well reserved man who obviously doesn't like talking about himself...

Highly recommended viewing.",1240963200,5,943,5.315436241610739
2616736,4,B000GRUVVA,"Well First Off I Find Not All OF His Tuning Is A Hole Tone, I Find It's More Like A Half A Tone Down,But Yes It's Cool That He Made This Video. Yes I Found It Help Me Find Some Things Out To Me Looks Like All People He Talked About I The Styles And Techniques Of Guitar Legends.",1196899200,2,278,3.7288135593220337
2616737,5,B000GRUVVA,"I enjoy Trower's flavoring of electric blues...and am pleased to recommend this product. being a player for about 40 years, I know my way around the guitar and in recent years have had the luxury of not playing in a band, which, requires dedicating off-playing time to keeping current with set music, which, is not always your personal prefernce. So, for a hoot, I have bought a few of these instructionals just to see what they had. Of the few I've seen, I like this one, and most especially recommend it to developing players. It opens with Trower in concert probably late80's/early 90's, which, allows the viewer to grasp what the man is about and to hear the finished product of what he is about to show in the lessons. Trower offers good info on his tone, (probably one of the things I like best about his sound) in the way of set up, amps/setting and effects. From there he explains the basics to the degree that will allow an ambitious player to take it from there, so to speak. Covers some nice licks, that will open a guys mind a bit, as his style is not so standard rock/blues from perhaps higher profile stars. Trower is a very interesting guy and from what I can tell in this product, seemingly a very nice-humble guy, which is most appealing. The slow-motion-looping ability allows a player to go over an over the material covered. Last, as a treat...he shows the format on a couple of his hits. Not for the novice, but, for someone who has the basics down and wants to be a better player...this is a very good product...By the way...Trower is on Tour in the US...January, starts in Florida. I'm going to catch him in Seattle in Feb...catch him while you can, I doubt he will be touring for another 30 years. Best Regards",1195603200,17,1734,4.4905063291139244
2616738,5,B000GRUVVA,"Robin Trower is a player held in high esteem by guitarists around the world. His totally unique sound and style is fully explored in this excellent video from the early 1990's. His technique is fully revealed at a liesurely pace, with excellent camerawork, and includes surprising comments and demonstrations of his personal guitar setup and amplification. It's a very friendly, intimate lesson that will have an immediate impact on any aspiring blues/rock musician. This set would be a bargain at five times the price!",1184198400,9,519,5.190476190476191
2616739,5,B000GRUVVA,"I received this dvd as a gift.

I wouldn't have considered purchasing it myself, as I am not a musician.

I was in awe for the whole dvd! To have one of the greatest living rock guitarists explain his techniques in his own (shy) words is priceless!

A must buy for any devoted Trower fan...",1178064000,11,290,4.236363636363636
2616740,5,B000GRUVVA,Any chance to see Robin play is a real treat. To my mind he really filled the gap after the untimely death of JIMI who's music I love of course. He really has the GOD given touch. You know it just goes to show that a STRAT and MARSHALL don't make you an Instant JIMI or Robin. Anyway this DVD is a MUST for guitar playing fans of ROBIN.,1175558400,7,336,3.8840579710144927
2616741,3,B000GRUVVA,I like Robin as much as Hendrix. It is so funny to watch Robin try to explain why he has the magic.  He takes very simple riffs and techniques and makes them magic. You can't teach this stuff but good to watch for any guitar playing fan. Don't exect to learn much though. You either got the touch or you don;t.,1166832000,8,310,4.081967213114754
8134178,5,B000GRUVVA,"This is a great DVD for learning the style, tips and tricks from one of the greatest Blues/Rock guitar players of all time, it is embarrassing to think that Robin Trower has not as of yet been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame when so many other musicians that don't have much originality or talent at all have been inducted. Robin has been perfecting his sound since 1961 and just like a fine wine has gotten better with age, his latest album ""Time and Emotion"" is a testament that even at his age, he is still putting out great new music.",1505433600,2,549,4.288461538461538

8134182,3,B000GRUVVA,Robin is a great player in and a legend but all this video does is expose the fact that he knows little about music notation/theory.  And that's cool.  Some of the best players in history admitted to knowing little about music or how to communicate it.  But if that's the case then they should stay away from music instruction videos.,1413504000,,334,4.533333333333333
8134183,4,B000GRUVVA,So so instructional video. Learned a few things.,1410480000,,48,5.125
8134184,5,B000GRUVVA,"It's great that Robin Trower was willing to share some of his secret techniques, from vibrato to guitar setup. I've tried for a year to get his tone from my own Stratocaster, and I am now as close as I think I can get. I'm really happy with this tutorial, and by none other than the great Robin Trower.",1389571200,,302,4.135593220338983
8134185,5,B000GRUVVA,"If you like Robin Trower and you play guitar you gotta watch this DVD. It's great to see the man explaining things himself, I love training videos. Thanks for making all this great content so easy to find Amazon.

Good luck, good music and good rocking to all!",1383782400,,260,4.416666666666667
8134186,5,B000GRUVVA,"Lost in the Hendrix shadow, Trower was and still is one of my favorites ever. It was nice to see him giving the lessons instead of a stand-in showing you Robin's licks. Also, Trower is probably the 'face-pulling king'. You can really see him getting into every note he plays. This won't make you sound like him, or even play but so much like him...but it was cool to see and figure out how he did a few of those riffs. A must-have for any Trower fan, whether you play or not. He seems so likable and humble, almost meek at times....until he plays. Most people forget him because of Clapton, Beck and Page...but every real guitarist knows who he is, and I believe that's how Mr. Trower likes it.",1325548800,8,694,4.346153846153846
8134187,4,B000GRUVVA,This great instructional DVD is a great insight into the under-rated blues guitarist Robin Trower. And the best thing is ... Robin himself is doing the tutoring. Great examples of many of his licks and even a slow mo mode to help work out all his great fingering licks. Highly recommended for both Robin fans and guitar players in general.,1302393600,3,339,4.666666666666667
