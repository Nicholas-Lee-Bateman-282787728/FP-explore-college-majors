4424,5,0767020294,"We LOVE A&E's production of Jane Eyre the BEST, and we have seen four other Jane Eyre movies. A&E's Jane Eyre is so MOVING. You can FEEL the characters every emotion by their GREAT facial expressions and how they  speak to each other. The Beautiful music and everything about this  production is so WONDERFUL. This movie really Tugs at your Heart. It is  truly UNFORGETTABLE!!!!!",925171200,,379,4.8
4425,5,0767020294,"Let me say first, that I have seen every movie made of the book.  The book enchanted me so much that I had to see them.  The first version with Orson Wells was wonderfully acted but sadly produced. It left many scenes out.  That is my second favorite. This is my favorite by far because it included  many of the scenes that have been forgotten by most of the movies.  It did  have many flaws, and if they would have stuck to the book it would have  been better, but I recommend it highly for anyone wanting a good veiwing.",924307200,,522,4.16

4465,4,0767020294,"Many passionate Jane Eyre fans hate this adaptation. I have read the book more than once and I rather liked this version-- it doesn't maybe glorify the story to the fans, but it does accurately represent what the book looks like to the rest of us. The fans get upset about inaccuracies, but these are all just details. The essence of the Jane Eyre story is captured in this movie. An unhappy single woman falls in love with a rude cranky older guy. Turns out the guy is married, but it works out. There is beautiful scenery involved and a big house. Some spooky scenes.
The production is lavish and the actors excellent. Ciaran Hinds may not be the dashing hunk Rochester of legend, but he is the older man of the book. Sometimes I wonder if the Jane fans are mixing Rochester up with Teen Wolf.  And Samantha Morton makes an elegant, attractive Jane.

4471,3,0767020294,"Imagine having your favorite book cast by two of your favorite actors for film. To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.

Alas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.

But what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a ""What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?"" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out ""That's right leave, its just like you."" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed ""kissing"" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)

But there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch. These are excellent actors. It would, I feel, been first rate to have these truly talented people in a better adaptation.",1462924800,,2401,4.6635071090047395

4484,5,0767020294,"Both Ciarn Hinds and Samantha Morton are stunning and intense in this adaptation of Jane Eyre.  Although it is only a TV movie (not a mini-series as such novels deserve) it is one of the better versions, though I have yet to find one that I distinctly do not like (the older ones, excepting the one I originally saw by Orson Welles are all somewhat DATED in their acting, sets, cinematography and choice of emphasis).  The narration of the story by Samantha Morton, as Jane, gives greater insight into the repressed but passionate nature of the literary character.

Among the adaptations I rank this as my 3rd favorite (the most recent with Fassbender is 1st and the BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens is 2nd)",1456012800,4,708,4.693548387096774

4510,5,0767020294,"This version is one of the best adaptions I've ever seen. I can't get enough of it!!!
It this particular version a lot of events were dismissed and rewritten, but what you can expect from not-even-2-hour movie!? Also didn't like Mr. Rochester in the beginning, he was hateful, mean, arrogant, bad-mannered, not quite Charlotte Bronte's description and again -still handsome (in the book he wasn't handsome man). But with the movie's progress he becomes quit Bronte's Rochester.
I JUST LOVE the passion between Jane & Mr. Rochester!!! The both actors are brilliant!!! How they felt each other! Best chemitry on the screen. Also like to see Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax - wonderful! (I'm her big fan).
Great movie, but if you never watched other versions and/or never read the book, do so, it'll explain a lot of gaps of this movie ( I HIGHLY recommend ""not-so-wide-known""1973 adaption. I've just discovered it myself and was blown away...)",1426550400,,949,5.050955414012739

4524,5,0767020294,"Charlotte Bronte is second only to Jane Austen as the best author ever.  this is an excellent classic and very well done.  However, even though Jane Eyre obviously had never been kissed prior to falling in love with Mr. Rochester, her director in this movie should have told her to fake it because the lack of experience in the kiss does not endear one to the scene.  And it was a very critical scene but I wanted to throw rocks at her.  The movie is excellent and well done....other than the kissing scene.",1419984000,,507,4.419354838709677

4528,5,0767020294,"This is a great Jane Eyre. I actually have 3 favorites: 1983, this one, and 2011. They are each different and have qualities that I love. Ciaran Hinds definitely brings out the edgier, tempermental side, which like it or not, is the way Mr. Rochester is described in the book. I like that portrayal, but I also appreciate the more restrained rendition done by Michael Fassbender, as do I enjoy the cocky, domineering traits brought out by Timothy Dalton. They are all good, folks. No need to feel disloyal for liking more than one. However, stay away from the William Hurt version. He did not even come close to filling Mr. Rochesters shoes. It was a train wreck.
What I really like about this version is the sweet chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. She finds him charming in spite of how flawed he is, and it really shows in her expressions. Ciaran Hinds' Mr. Rochester is abrupt and unpolished, and I rather liked his portrayal. His Mr. Rochester is gruff, passionate, volatile, and vulnerable. And Samantha Morton's Jane is spunky, sweet, and feminine, I think more so than other Jane Eyre's. Yet she still embodied Jane's quiet reserve and stifled passion.
I watched this movie when it came out back in 1997. All opinions are my own.",1415923200,3,1244,4.7110091743119265
4529,4,0767020294,I prefer the older movie of Jane Eyre.  I continue to look for the older movie that was filmed in the fourth.  If you have that movie  let me know so that I may order it,1414195200,,169,3.638888888888889
4530,2,0767020294,"This movie is good, but entirely too rushed. It would have been a very good idea, in my opinion, it have at least put captions letting you know how many years passed between particular scenes. With it not being this way you miss much of the power of her story. However, no screen adaption is ever perfect, and given that decades of Jane's life are covered in an hour and a half (thus the benefit of captions) the movie adaption is about as faithful as you can do.",1413331200,,463,4.2727272727272725

4533,5,0767020294,"I usually don't like remakes of old movies, but this one is great.  The character of Jane is a strong woman.  Not in today's sense where ""strong"" women can be obnoxious and demanding or for that matter can beat any guy in the room, but in the truest sense.  Jane overcomes a terrible childhood to become a governess.  Even though she falls in love with the master of house she is able to control her emotions and conduct herself with dignity.  It's a beautiful love story and well worth watching.",1409702400,,496,4.466666666666667

4538,1,0767020294,"After years of owning the book, I finally got around to reading it a year or two ago.  Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie.
While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!
..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!
_________

If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).
If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out.",1407369600,3,2386,4.828431372549019

4548,5,0767020294,"Victorian rags-to-riches? Not quite. Institutionalized by her aunt (Deborah Findlay -Cranford), child Jane's life can get no worse. Moved on as a governess at Thornfield, its wealthy owner Mr Rochester (Ciaran Hinds). Jane trifles with love after a not so dignified introduction. There is a strangeness about the house and among those living there. This version dwells little on the child Jane, but focuses on her relationship with her master.
Secrets are hidden behind a closed 3rd floor, a female, a dangerous person. Jane is even required to stop a murder. It is the inner struggle of mature emotion that makes Jane Eyre such a compulsive story, written by Charlotte Bronte as one of her finest novel works.
No faults can be said of this fine cast. Samantha Morton is superb and believable as Jane. Gemma Jones (Last Tango in Halifax) plays Mrs Fairfax here, and has been a favorite of ours since she starred in `The Duchess of Duke Street.'
My wife and I both liked this DVD version of Jane Eyre. Perhaps even better than the 2 other adaptations we own (1971 and 2011) even though we did much approve of one of our favorite actresses, Dame Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax, in the latter.

4579,3,0767020294,"I am puzzled as to why the director, producers, and writers of this so-called adaptation of Jane Eyre decided to stray so far from the actual novel by Charlotte Bront. Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.

Samantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge/dp/B0000AQS3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mayor of Casterbridge</a>&nbsp;and who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.

If you watch closely, you'll recognize several other familiar faces in British period drama.

The cinematography is beautiful enough though the score is forgettable, and ultimately, I would rate this as one of the weakest adaptations of Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. That being said, I would still recommend watching it if you're a fan of Hinds and Morton and also if only to do some comparisons with other adaptations.",1354665600,2,2706,7.924092409240924
4580,5,0767020294,Samantha Morton won my heart in this absolutely amazing movie. I ended up purchasing every movie she made after seeing her in this. She's a really Great actress and I'm sure most anyone would enjoy this movie.,1354147200,,209,4.675675675675675
4581,5,0767020294,"I loved this version of Jane Eyre. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester, the directing and production design was wonderful. Don't miss this one!",1350864000,,148,4.96
4582,5,0767020294,"I love Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, and I've read it several times.  Also an avid movie fan, I have seen almost every production of Jane Eyre.  I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner.  Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.

However, this version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton is my second favorite for several reasons.  First, the casting was perfect.  Ciaran Hinds does a wonderful job portraying Edward Rochester, a complex, authoritative and tortured man who is hiding a horrible secret.  He is supposed to be almost 20 years older than Jane and not overly handsome--although not as moody and dark as Orson wells, he gives the character more humor and fits the bill admirably.  Samantha Morton is simply fantastic as Jane Eyre.  She is my favorite of all the female leads to date.  She is not as pretty as Joan Fontaine or Mia Wasikowska, but she is attractive enough to be pleasant to watch.  (Jane is supposed to be ""plain."")  Her Jane has much more personality compared to other actresses who have played the part.  She gives us a strong, confident Jane while showing us enough warmth to make her sympathetic to the viewer.  She is Jane Eyre in my eyes.  The two leads have one thing that many other versions do not--fantastic chemistry!!!  Together, they sizzle on the screen, which is something you would not expect from these two as a couple.

The production is fantastic, as is the photography and script adaptation.  I have only two beefs with this production--first, the actress playing Adele was too old and rather irritating.  Second, I absolutely hate the singing voice they dubbed in for Edward/Ciaran--that high, operatic tenor just didn't seem like it could come out of his throat.  If they could have fixed those two things, this would have been the perfect version.

As for the other versions I have seen, I'll list them here in my order of preference with a quick review:

3)  2011 Version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fessbender:  My third favorite; major problems include Mia being way too pretty to play Jane, and she needed a bit more personality.  Michael Fessbender was admirable as Rochester, but he physically did not fit the part--too handsome and too ""blonde"".  Rochester was always referred to being dark, mysterious with black hair and eyes--hard to get past that part, but he is a sexy man.
4)  2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens:  Non-descript actors, but a decent production.  Except for one hot scene with Jane and Edward on the bed (which would NEVER have happened in the novel), sort of forgettable.
5)  1971 Version with George C. Scott and Susannah York:  Miscast; both leads were too old for the parts--so/so version, nothing too much going on here.
6)  2003 Version with Willian Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg:  I like Willian Hurt, but I hated him in this part.  Too blonde, too cold, no mystery here.  Charlotte Gainsbourg was painfully plain with NO personality.  This was as dry as toast and uninteresting with little to hold your attention.  NO chemistry between the two leads--absolutely none.
7)  BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke:  There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton!  He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward.  There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, ""Do you find me handsome?"" and she answers ""No.""  What a laugh!  Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy.  No one could get past this without laughing.  He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward.  On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production!  His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock.  Not attractive, which isn't a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton.  In real life, Ol' Tim wouldn't have looked twice in her direction.  Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy.  So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production.  It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV/BBC production so you can't expect much.  I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it.",1350518400,5,4924,4.765680473372781
4583,4,0767020294,"Not surprisingly, the reviews of this movie are all over the board.  I have to say that I think the actors playing Rochester and Jane did a great job.  Rochester has been described as a screamer, and while I can see why people say that, Rochester IS a very emotional character.  I didn't find that a problem.  I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here!  That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a short Jane Eyre, and all the stuff that was cut out were the things that you tend to want to hurry through when you're reading it anyway.  In fact, I have been guilty of skipping through Jane's childhood in one or two of the versions that I own.  :D  This movie also totally skips the whole issue of Jane gaining an independence, which in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter too much to the meat of the story.",1348531200,,990,4.366120218579235

4585,5,0767020294,"I'm not into Drama, love comedy whatever type films. I usually stick with Horror, Sci-fi, Fantasy, Crime Documentaries. However, the story of Jane Eyre is ONE, and I think the only one, of my favorite love stories that I can watch and get engrossed in. I have seen the 1983 (Dalton), 1996 (Hurt), 1997 (Hinds), and the 2006 (Toby Stephens), and may get around to watching the new one 2011 with Fassbender. Out of all of them, the 1983 is my FAV!!! It stays very close to the book and is longer so you get to see more character and relationship development. The storyline is more detailed - love it!

But I digress. What I like about this 1997 movie version with Morton and Hinds, is that they were able to still build that love relationship in a very short amount of time. Coupled with an AWESOME score done by Richard Harvey (which I wish he made into an OST), you're able to see the development and feel their torment and joy. Albeit a short film, the scenes are shot beautifully. They filmed the parts that were important from the story; and for anyone who didn't read the book or watched the mini series, you wouldn't be able to tell how short the story was because the story line flows fluidly. So you're not left confused. The ending is beautiful as should any love story should be. Of course I cried in the end :) All in all, they pulled off a really good movie from this awesome timeless story. I think it deserves a 5 star.

If you would like to see a more in depth version of Jane Eyre, definitely check out the 1983 with Tim Dalton. The man was FINE in that one and I believe Zelah Clarke, was the closest to portraying the true Jane. The 2006 version is also close to the story and is shorter than the 1983 by only a few minutes. But to me, it lacks a bit of luster. The emotions Jane portrays seems a bit off in some moments. And Toby Stephens just didn't do it for me as Mr. Rochester. He seems more soft spoken. Maybe it's because I keep comparing it to the 1983 version, naturally :). But the 2006 version is shot with up to date technology in the same natural authentic setting (the English moors), so the picture quality is very good.",1344384000,,2152,4.298029556650246
4586,3,0767020294,"The essence of my rant:  Samantha Morton good, Ciaran Hinds bad. Adaptation so-so. Pacing of film too hurried.

Although this is a more technically faithful adaptation than some I've seen, it was more of a gothic cartoon than a Monet impression of Bronte's novel. A good screenplay of a classic is deft in its choices of what passages to highlight and what to skip, what dialogue will be the best tribute to the original work but bring the characters to life;  what will illuminate the spirit of the novel. This lingered too long on some scenes and skipped over others, so that anyone who has not read the book might wonder what just happened, and it went too hard on some characters and too soft on others, making it harder to grasp their places in the story.

Samantha Morton is a fine choice for Jane--she played it in a mousy, understated way, with a few glimmers of a suppressed personality that was a decent depiction of the character.  And she looked nineteen, which is nice.  However, this served to highlight the creepiness factor when Ciaran Hinds as Edward Rochester comes growling and cussing into the story, acting more deranged and dangerous than his imprisoned wife.  The Hitleresque mustache, looming posture and unblinking stare make him more menacing than sad and brooding.  He barks and snarls his lines with no hint of the intended facetious humor and vulnerability that make Rochester a redeemable character.  When he does make romantic overtures toward Jane, it feels repellent and lecherous.  Not sexy at all.  It seems like Jane needs an intervention rather than finds the love of her life.

Want a better, more lush, fleshed-out, warm-hearted version?  Although he does not answer the Rochester character in looks as well as Hinds, Tobey Stephens in the Masterpiece Theatre production is way, way better:  rude and gruff by turns, guilty over his inability to be kind to Adele, with a tortured sense of duty to Bertha, his expressions and manner soften, his banter with Jane is amusing and the pivotal romantic scene is tender, fulfilling in the way it should be. Wilson is lovely, plain one moment and a shining pearl the next--perfect casting there.  Basically, you can picture Ruth Wilson and Stephens making love, and the thought does not make you shudder.  There you have it:  this should be a love story.",1340064000,3,2335,4.841309823677582
4587,1,0767020294,"I'm frankly surprised that this ""version"" has so many positive reviews!
While I love the book, I'm not what you would call a ""purist"".  Besides this one, I've seen 6 others ('11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie).
While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a miniseries (length); I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been re-written (and butchered), and some events added (made up)!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated!
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!

In conclusion, if you dare watch this insufferable abomination, you had better have a pair of ""frownies"" on hand; Rochester's scowl is that infectious!

..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!",1338163200,6,1427,5.02542372881356
4588,3,0767020294,"Jane is an orphan who first becomes a teacher at the rather grim school for orphans where she was raised, then takes a job as governess for a little french girl who is the natural child of a cranky Mr. Rochester. She can't help loving him, and eventually he is equally in love with her, in spite of the attempts of a wealthy neighbor to hook him. They plan to wed, and are at the altar when a man gallops up to the church and announces that the wedding must not take place.

From there you have to either read the book or see the movie; I've told you enough already. Modern audiences will be shouting at her not to be such a prude, but this is Victorian era, after all. And the girl has guts, which finally serves her well. The movie is well done, but it's a pretty bleak story.",1337385600,,778,4.118421052631579

4599,5,0767020294,"I have the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version of Jane Eyre, the George C. Scott/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it's one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester.  She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn't watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me.  She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton.  As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn't Rochester. The George C. Scott/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part.
.
There are many comments about the Hinda/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I've seen the Hinds/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds' and Morton's recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding.  Hinds' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds' part.  The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.

Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.

I hated this version.  I usually enjoy Samantha Morton's work, but she declined to act in this film...and Ciaran Hinds chewed the scenery so much, I'm surprised that there were walls left standing at Thornfield...even after the fire!

There is very little character development in this script and I found myself not caring about Jane or Rochester, which is a problem when presenting ""Jane Eyre.""

I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man.

I love the 'look' as Jane but her acting is just not there. It is like she is too faint and disembodied in the role. Jane is a substantial person with depth. Samantha captures the fairy unworldy part but never is strong and resounding in her performance. It is almost like the role was too much for what she had inside to give to it.

Ciaran Hinds on the other hand carries this version.  He is a GREAT Mr. Rochester! I love the novel and have various movie versions; I was totally surprised by him. He totally carries the flick! With the exception of the kissing scene where he reveals his feelings for her after she returns from being away - the side of the face fake kisses (don't look!).  How did they let all THAT stay in the final? It was so entirely awkward. Forget that part when you see it as it was a total disaster.  But, I was totally surprised by how great he was in this movie.  A good look for him as I did not care for him much in the Jane Austen adapation of Persuasion.

I very much like Gemma Jones who plays the best Mrs. Fairfax; this version fills in the blanks as far as did Mrs. Fairfax know what was going on?  This is the only vesion that does so.

While one cannot expect a 2 hour movie to encompass every detail of a novel, it is expected that the production team keeps to original novel to a certain degree, which is not the case with this one.

I was hoping that this adaptation was also great especially with Ciaran Hinds in it. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I understand that this version is much shorter than above mentioned adaptations, but still not showing such important scenes like aunt Reed deathbed confession or not giving any explanation who St. John and his sisters (in this version only one sister) are to Jane were disappointing.

4644,1,0767020294,"What makes Jane Eyre a timeless novel is it's brilliantly colorful and evocative narrative. Charlotte Bronte's true talent is in her wording and her vivid and unique characters. This movie falls desperately short on these most important fronts. The narrative to this adaptation is poor indeed and lacks any of the fiery spark of the novel. Rather than choosing to re-work the first section of the story touching on Jane's childhood, a voice-over jumps from moment to moment so that we have only brief flashes of her early life, making for a stilted and bumbling beginning. The filmography is desperately lacking, and by inserting ""imaginary"" voices and images into Jane's perception, appears to imply a psychotic rather than imaginative narrator. Samantha Morton, whose work is usually delightful and full of life, is the image of Jane without any of the spirit. Ciaran Hinds, though he has some of Mr. Rochester's manner, is lacking in the overall demeanor. Gemma Jones makes for an unnecessarily snappish Mrs. Fairfax and Timia Berthone's acting is self-conscious to the point of embarrassment.

I am deeply disappointed in A&E whose work can usually be depending upon. Overall, this was a waste of the $2.00 spent on rental fees.",1262131200,4,1232,5.099009900990099
4645,2,0767020294,"I've been wanting to watch this version of JE for years. Despite seeing scores of negative reviews here, I thought to myself--it can't possibly be that bad. It was made back in A&E's classics heyday. [Remember when A&E once stood for Arts & Entertainment? But I diverge.] It's stars Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. It's Jane Eyre! How could it possibly be mucked up?

Despite having everything going for it, this version doesn't live up to expectations. There are several reasons for this:

~The atmosphere. You won't feel submerged in Jane's world. The sets and costumes look cheap. What is more, the gothic touches are missing. For example, the red room sequence. The camera just flashes around the room-but it doesn't show us the shadows, the things Jane imagines, that make her scared. It's just a room.

~the script. JE is dense book so not everything is going to be able to be packed in a two hour movie but too much was left out of this movie. Where is the gypsy scene? Where is Jane's discovery that she is not solely an orphan but has family? Where's Jane's conversations with Mrs. Reed when she returns home? Even on a basic level, the script suffers--rather than develop plot points, it just jumps to them as the story requires. For example, the St. John sequence is too short. The Blanche Ingram sequence is especially undeveloped.

~the acting. Samantha Morton is the saving grace of this production. Her Jane is gentle but formidable, quiet but with a backbone. Ciaran Hinds is not a one-note actor, but as Mr. Rochester, he is only shown as being agitated, spiteful and mean. Even when he is kind, he is cruel. Jane would never fall in love with this Rochester.

At times, it also feels like a parody. The parody elements particularly come through in the handling of Bertha Rochester. It's like watching a Monty Python sketch when she's onscreen.

In short, this is a dud! It's worth watching in order to be able the appreciate how good the 06 version is. Also, if you are in the know about BBC programs, it can amusing to watch just to see the once and future Captain Wentworths both featured in the same production.

4646,2,0767020294,"I found this interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre good. One need only view various interpretations, such as the 1944 Orson Welles film, starring both himself and Joan Fontaine, to appreciate this 1997 version. Twentieth Century Fox's wartime genre encapsulates the studio art department with very poorly executed visuals in the 1944 film. One knows without doubt that this was made in Hollywood.
However, each version is different, with different characterizations,style and pace. This 1997 original A & E version is good stylistically, the lead characters give earnest interpretations, but seem a bit caricatured and one-dimensional.
I have read the various reviews praising the Timothy Dalton version and cannot for the life of me understand the praise. He is entirely too wooden and one-dimensional. One does not even perceive the character of Rochester, with its depths and nuances, in his portrayal.
The best film Jane Eyre thus far, in my opinion, is the BBC 1973 version with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, also available through Amazon.com. Read my review on this version. It lacks the sumptiousness of the latter entries but the acting is first rate.

I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (""Sense & Sensibility"") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of ""Jane Eyre,"" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt.

4648,2,0767020294,"First of all I would like to say that Samantha morton was one of the best Jane. She was really believable in her role and her acting was fantastic. it is really a pity she got put in this version. I have to main objections to the book which you may read here below if you wish.
My objections to the books are this: First of all I did not like Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester. I saw him a few months ago in Persuasion and was so Happy in his portrayal of Captain Wentworth. It was not the case with his sad portrayal of Edward Rochester. He seemed to think that Mr Rochester was an very, very, very angry man and nothing more. I never really liked Edward's character but he was a lot more complicated than that. He may be weak and selfish but he is also brooding, moody and passionate. To see a proper portrayal of Rochester. You must refer to the performances of Micheal Jayston, Toby Stephens and Timothy Dalton. Especially Dalton! Ciaran Hinds did nothing but scream all the time. And I never could imagine Mr. Rochester with a mustache.
Secondly I would have liked the script to be a little closer to the novel. The first half is not that bad but the second is horrid. Nothing is mentioned of Jane inheriting a fortune and one of St John's sister is deleted. And speaking of St John we don't get to know how mesmerizing his character is(And I have definatly seen Rupert Penry-Jones look better). The version was just too short! Jane and Rochester's readmitting their love for each other is shortened into one scene but Morton managed to pull it off quite well. I repeat she is the only cause why I do not give this version one star.
Need I say more? Those are the main things I find disagreable but there are several more I could state, but I will not waste my time and I think I have made my points.
To conclude if you want to watch this movie so badly go watch it on the internet. If it happens to please you and you wish to see it agin then you may buy it. If you wish to see a truly fantastic version. Then I suggest you buy the 1983 version. If you want to see other ones then also buy the 1973  or the 2006 version. They are definitely better than this one.

  Jane and Edward have a lot in common, and yet they are so different! Jane helps heal, Edward's broken, empty heart, and Edward is the first man that ever loved Jane, she has always been so alone, it did not take him long to see how special Jane, really was!

 In the movie I loved the talk that Edward gives Jane, about Adele's mother, by the lake. And I love the part where Edward asks Jane about, why she did not write him a letter, while she was gone. And I loved the part where Edward asked Jane to watch the sunrise with him! I highly recommend this movie, I liked this version of Jane Eyre very much! I loved the intense, all consuming emotions, of this Mr. Edward R.!

 But the most compelling, heartfelt scene was when Edward ,who was now, a scarred and broken man, with tears rolling down his face, with still so much love for Jane, while Jane helded him in her arms!

4661,5,0767020294,"Well, at first I didn't think I was going to like this movie, because Mr. Rochester, who is of course rough at first, was over-the-top irate. He got so wild when Jane ""bewitched"" his horse that I thought he was going to take his wife's place in the attic. So over-the-top was his rough exterior that his passionate scenes with Jane at first evoked from me hearty laughter, which I don't think was the intended effect. She'd never like a guy like that, and he'd...well. I just wasn't seeing it. At first.

So why the five star rating? Because this is a difficult movie to get right. It's not five stars for perfection, but five stars for being far and away the best adaptation of the four I've seen so far.

It spares you lengthy portrayals of the scenes where a little goes a long way (Lowood, also the Auntie's stewardship of Jane, etc.) and instead saves the film for scenes that really need to be developed carefully in order for the lengthy novel to be credible onscreen. That is, Rochester and Jane need time to grow in their relationship. Some adaptations try to rush it and you see Jane falling in love with a crazy, irate cooky guy who explores his deepest affect, out loud and rather distastefully, to what appears onscreen to be a complete stranger not ridiculously fond of him. This version was a very nice effort, but there was one part a bit rushed-her missing him after she simply tells us they had more talks together. A minor detail. Her portrayal was very good and real. Compare it to the 1996 version (Hurt/Gainsbourg) where Rochester comments to Jane about the tears ready to come into her eyes. This is after Jane is forced to watch Rochester with the new chick on the block. Then he says, ""or do I see them there now?"" Problem is, she doesn't look at all like she's upset or about to cry, or even depressed, although perhaps disappointed and maybe slightly wounded. Under these circumstances, Rochester's assessment makes him look self-important, sadistic and weird.

Although, in this version (1997) I think Jane gets too passionate too soon, before Rochester has begun much transformation and become truly transparent and honest which I think took a bit away from the credibility. Then again, Jane comes from Lowood.

Bottom line: For delicate, complex development, sensitive performances, and for sparing us the stuff we don't need much of in favor of the parts that need the time to develop, I give it five. Nicely done.",1232582400,2,2445,4.67906976744186
4662,3,0767020294,"Having read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte in high school and having viewed many version of Jane Eyre, I believe this version is not the best or even the second best - and hence, not worth a person's time or money.

My reasons are as follows:
(1) The film is too short, leaving out too much of the novel. For instance, it completely skips Jane's conversation with her Aunt Reed when her aunt is on her deathbed.

(2) The acting is not as good as might be desired. The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)

(3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.

I recommend the following:

(1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes

(2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutes

wrong.

the acting is decent (i wouldn't expect less from Ciarn Hinds), the setting isn't too shabby, and it's fairly true to the the story- however there are few points that drove me absolutely crazy and kept me from getting swept up into the story.

1.) Mr. Rochester is a gruff, touchy type who likes his own way, he does NOT however, scream and yell at the drop of a hat. from the first scene, that's what he pretty much does the entire rest of the film.

2.) samantha morton just isn't jane eyre. period.

3.) Ciarn Hinds' mustache. it made him look like Hitler in a lot of scenes, and quite frankly it ruins all the heart rending moments.

-Samantha Morton too cute and young - she looked like she was 12
-Ciaran Hinds: too old and creepy for the part, came across as a raging, shouting bull during the whole movie. Rochester was an angry man but he wasn't THAT angry all the time.
-No chemistry whatsoever between the two characters. Samantha Morton looked mortified to have to kiss Ciaran Hinds in the kissing scenes. Frankly, I'd be mortified too.

Avoid this version as well as the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg versions- don't let your curiosity to see another version of Jane Eyre get the best of you. They're both awful. See the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson versions instead.",1224288000,4,787,4.779411764705882

The Timothy Dalton version is much better and truer not only to the book, but to the spirit of the book.  Jane does not leave Thornfield because of her pride, as intimated in this version, she leaves because it would be morally wrong to stay.  The whole book is about doing the right thing despite the main character's own personal desires.  That in the end is what brings her happiness.

Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Edward Rochester, as is Samantha Morton as Jane. Certainly, the only fault I found with the film is that is wasn't longer!

4682,1,0767020294,"I hated this version of Jane Eyre - it's just wrong in so many ways.  First, while I would agree that most of the actors are well cast, and Samantha Morton is a very apt Jane Eyre, I was incredibly disappointed in Ciaran Hinds.  He is horribly, horribly miscast and, as a result, I have no idea what Jane finds to love in his angry, ranting, flat, and one-dimensional characterization of Rochester.  There's no brooding sadness, no playful charm; he's just abusive and selfish and mean the whole film.

Also, the adaptation is severely lacking in purpose and sacrifices the important themes and relationships that Bronte crafted so well in an attempt to cater to our short attention spans and our desire for cookie cutter romance.  Moments are changed or left out completely, for no apparent reason, creating situations that make no sense (i.e. why does she go home to see Mrs. Reed before she dies? We never find out.) Some scenes are just creepy - like when Mr. Rochester is lustfully stroking her hand after she puts out the fire in his room - very disturbing.  And the dialog has been changed and modernized making the whole thing seem like a bad soap opera.  Please don't insult my intelligence!!!

But the worst aspect of this version is that Jane is not allowed to grow and change and become the independent woman that she needs to be before she can be equal to Rochester and come back to him on her own terms - which is the whole point of the book!  I was actually offended by the ending of the film and felt that throughout Jane is dumbed down and made into a weak, lovesick girl.

The 2006 Masterpiece Theater version is without a doubt the best, followed closely by the Timothy Dalton version.  STAY FAR AWAY from this one.",1200960000,17,1734,4.543408360128617
4683,1,0767020294,"This 1997 TV production is called ""Jane Eyre"", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciarn Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciarn Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.

Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Adle, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.

As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: ""I know it may sound silly but...."" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.

This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.

Equally lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like ""I feel that your passions are aroused"" are appropriate for ""Sex in the City"", but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006.",1199750400,19,5390,4.749199573105656

Jane herself is boring and emotionless, asks too many questions and incredibly bossy. Rochester is alright, except his barking tone in several scenes and his somewhat lusty attitude towards Jane.
Rochester's and Jane's romance develops too suddenly without giving it the proper time to build up, thus they have little to no chemistry.
Many important things are not included in the book such as Jane learning of her rich uncle and receiving her inheritance after meeting the Rivers.  New and rediculous scenes are created such as Rochester and Jane running into Blanche Ingram in town while shopping for their wedding. Blanche herself is unattractive and too nice.
Most of the people in this movie act out of character. Seems like the writers and directors forgot to read the book or decided to create their own story of Jane Eyre.

4687,2,0767020294,"I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.

4688,2,0767020294,"I have it in my Jane Eyre collection and the chemistry is not believable at all.  Ciaran Hinds is barking at her the entire time. There is no inflection in his voice that would give way to you believing he had a soft spot for her on more than one occasion. He also didn't have Mr. Rochester's dark wit.  If you want to see Ciaran Hinds in a wonderful movie, see Jane Austen's ""Persuasion.""

Samantha Morton, although a great actress here, played Jane far too impertinent for her position, the era and most importantly for the post-Helen Jane who had a gentle spirit that made Mr. Rochester drawn to her in the first place.

I was glad to see the Bertha portrayal was very close to the book in this one as well as the 83' version.  Unlike, the most recent Masterpiece version that had Bertha looking like she could step out of Thornfield, put on a gown and walk the red carpet.

If you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" watch the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version  which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester. Zelah Clarke plays Jane perfectly as unworldly and innocent and knowing her ""station"" so to speak, but also having her own mind.

But for me, the Robert Young version from 1997 is easily my favorite.  At 108 minutes, it's sadly abridged, but the more vigorous pace and, more vitally, the sparkling performance on the part of the lead actress, Samantha Morton, more than make up for this defect.

The essence of Jane and Rochester is all here: Passion.

Beyond the highly truncated screenplay which makes little attempt to be faithful to the novel, both Morton and Hinds are horribly miscast.  I love both these actors and was initially excited to see them in these roles -- until I sat down to watch it.  Hinds made a wonderful Capt. Wentworth (and many other roles) but as Rochester all he does is shout and bellow his way thru the story.  His Rochester is entirely one-note, a very shallow performance on his part -- there's no dimension, no spark, no inner life.  He seems to have viewed the role as just a cliched cartoonish gothic hero - he doesn't approach the character with any seriousness.  Morton is equally shallow in the role - neither actor seems to have taken their characters seriously.  There are good production values and Morton and Hinds are good enuf that some good moments come thru.  This certainly is superior to the William Hurt/Zeffereli version, but then that's not too difficult.  Even the recent flawed Toby Stephens version is superior to this one as well.

No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.

Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet.

Samantha is amazing to me here, as she, if you can believe it, also plays timid little Harriet Smith in Jane Austen's ""Emma"" (A&E version).  What a difference in personality and character!!  And so convincing!

And Ciaran Hinds plays Wentworth in Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" with Amanda Root as Anne, and of course, he's nothing like Mr. Rochester.

if given a longer production and more loyalty to the book, i could imagine this would have been a particularly wonderful adaptation. ciaran hinds and samantha morton are wonderful as rochester and jane. i really enjoy watching their performances. i can feel their frustrations and passions. their conversations are powerful although condensed. hinds is an amazing actor, and i enjoyed his portrayal. morton - although hindered by a short script/movie - was excellent. i am convinced morton's portrayal of jane eyre is the best out of all the adaptations i have seen. this makes it particularly disappointing that she (and hinds) were not allowed to fully incorporate all the details of the book, spread out over hours of film. ah yes indeedy, that would be sweet.

so i think the only 'problem' i have with this adaptation is the length and the resulting lack of true-to-book dialogue and story-lines somewhat external to the rochester/jane focus, such as her prolonged visit to her dying aunt, and the real way she met up with mr. rivers and his sisters, and how she inherited a fortune from her uncle. of these ommited or condensed things, i especially miss the grand debates between jane and edward. it doesnt allow the viewer to fully experience the chase, to savor their growing desperate love and passion. (the dalton/clarke 1983 version and the jayston/cusack 1973 version both are long features which follow the book much more closely, if that is what you are looking for.)

however, the condensed story and deviations from the book do not take away from the actor's performances. for example, i found the final scene particularly wonderful. when she finds him a broken man, and he tries to cast her off for her own good, she refuses, and he cries for all his past pains and and present joys. hinds, as i said, is amazing.",1163116800,3,2055,4.750700280112045

Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.

 The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.
 Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.

If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.

Samantha Morton brings Jane's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds, as Mr. Rochester, does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness.  They are supported by a strong cast, including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax.  The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.

1.) The replacement of Mr. Brockelhurst as head of Lowood school would have been a happy incident in this dark film. It would have satisfied the desire for such a wicked man to get his just desserts.

2.) There was no point changing the character of St. John Rivers who is supposed to be stoic and unemotional to this engaging, flirtatious character in the film. It only made her rejection of him bittersweet since he had been nothing but kind to her from the beginninig.

3.) Why couldn't they show her coming into the 20,000 pounds from her uncle. This happy coincidence is something that can only happen in a film and they should have taken advantage of it. She can end up RICH AND HAPPY.

The plus side is that I suppose JAne's suffering is not as prolonged as it is in the book. There's just enough suffering to not make it insipid. Also, the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane do a really good job as do the rest of the cast. There is a lot of using the eyes and body to act not just words. I adored the music which made the whole thing really melodramatic and everything such a novel from such a literary period in such an adaptation should be.",1138406400,5,1474,4.310469314079422
4703,5,0767020294,"The William Hurt and Timothy Dalton versions of this movie were good. But, here's a Jane Eyre that I truly enjoyed. An orphan raised in an orphanage, arrives at Thornfield Hall to care for an orphan, and falls in love with her seemingly infallible employer. It is a classic that grips you since in the end, the characters overcome the worst and find true happiness.

The young Jane was fantastic with her willful impestuousness. Samantha Morton brought spunk and humor to her character and I found it refreshing. And, Ciaran Hinds gives a lighthearted yet dramatic performance which makes him the perfect, indomitable, unfathomable, mysterious Edward Rochester. The actors exquisitely portrayed the conflict of pain, love, and passion, so that this movie epitomizes what Bronte fans look forward to.",1137196800,14,799,5.1937984496124034
4704,4,0767020294,"This was the first version of Jane Eyre I had ever seen and I enjoyed it very much.  There was a chemistry or ""passion"" between Jane and Rochester.  Samantha Morton played Jane better than anyone to date.  Jane had personality which I think she lacks in other versions.

I thought Ciaran Hinds as Rochester was wonderful.  He was very close to how I imagined Mr. Rochester in the book.  Not handsome but rugged and likeable.  He did tend to be a bully somtimes and that was a negative but he also had a tender side that came out through his facial expressions in a number of scenes between he and Jane.

A few negatives I found with the film are: 1. this version doesn't stay true to the book, much of the dialogue between the characters is rewritten, 2.  sometimes Rochester is a little too angry and 3.  I wish it were longer so that more of the book could be included.

I loved the ending and had butterflies watching it.  I found the passion between the actors moving and can easily watch this version again and again.

If however, you want a version of Jane Eyre that keeps closer to the book, then the Timothy Dalton version (1983) is a better choice.  It too is very good but is a bit dated (I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie).

Ideally, I would love to see a production of Jane Eyre that is as well done as the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.",1136505600,7,1409,4.264150943396227
4705,2,0767020294,"I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.

I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a ""Heather"" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....

I LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.

The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as ""Mr. Rochester"", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, ""Edward.""  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.

If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.",1135987200,9,1449,4.59375
4706,1,0767020294,"This version was awfully butchered.  It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel.  The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it.  The script lost a lot of the novel's ""punch"" and intensity.  This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin.  I couldn't sit through it again.

My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.

I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score.",1128988800,12,702,4.650406504065041
4707,1,0767020294,"This line just about sums up the absurdity of this A&E adaptation of our beloved Jane Eyre, which hardly bears any resemblance to the novel. Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!

It all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.

But then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.

Don't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.

Morton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.

In the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality. It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!

There are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to ""The governess,""while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!

The second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness. In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.

In the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:

""So you didn't find anyone else to marry you?"" sneers Rochester.

""I found someone who wanted to marry me."" again, the self-satisfied smile.

Good lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.",1128470400,23,3660,5.0732113144758735
4708,5,0767020294,"Yes, they did omit a lot from the book but what can you expect in 2 hours.  I agree that this movie would have been even better as a mini-series but I still liked it.  This movie had something many of the other versions lacked...chemistry and passion between the lead characters.  This is the only version that made me teary eyed, especially at the end at the part when Rochester sobs and says, ""Do not speak these words out of pity Jane.  How can you love me like this?""...and so on.  To me, when a movie moves you like that, it is special.  The music was very moving.

I think that after 150 years, a little creative interpretation of the book is refreshing.  The dialogue was changed but the plot and true meaning of the story remained the same.
I also thought Gemma Jones was excellent as Mrs. Fairfax.  The fact that reviews are so mixed just shows that everyone has their own intterpretation of this classic Bronte novel.",1125100800,19,927,4.437869822485207
4709,1,0767020294,"The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre.  I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'",1120176000,19,664,4.357723577235772
4710,1,0767020294,"Ever since I first read Jane Eyre years ago, it has been one of my favorite books, with its complex characters and wonderful writing.  Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie, however, was either completely unfamiliar with the book or thought they could do a better job than Charlotte Bronte.  Virtually none of the dialogue is from the book, and when they do keep something (like Rochester's wonderful line about the string connecting him to Jane), it's butchered.  If I weren't already familiar with the plot (or, rather, with how the plot should be), I would've been very confused by the choppiness of this movie, especially towards the end.  For example, Jane hears Rochester calling her name, the next minute she's in a carriage, and the next minute she's at Thornfield.  Wow, that was fast!

Jane's stay with St. John (who is much too nice in his proposal to her) and Diana is reduced to about five minutes, and her aunt's death is completely skipped over.  No mention at all is made of Jane's inheritance from her uncle, or of her family connections to the Rivers family.  Oh, and when Jane and Rochester go shopping in town, they run into Blanche Ingram, for some inexplicable reason.  Of course no movie can keep everything from the book, but this one simply butchered the plot.

And it butchered the characters as well.  Rochester is not supposed to continually bellow and snarl at Jane in the way Ciaran Hinds does in this movie.  (He was such a good Wentworth in Persuasion, I think the fault must lie with the director and script -- very disappointing.)  Nor is Rochester supposed to be a lust-crazed maniac who yells at Jane when she's leaving him, ""You want me!  I can feel your passions are aroused!  Say you want me!  SAY IT!""  He literally bellows at Jane all through this scene -- like when he shouts, ""Didn't I just know you'd desert me!  Really, Jane, you are SO PREDICTABLE!  Couldn't you be just a little more original?!...You're just a child who has NO IDEA WHAT REAL LOVE IS!""  And I use the capital letters because that's how the lines were spoken -- or rather, screamed.  It was impossible to see why any woman in her right mind would fall in love with this Rochester!  This aspect of the film, along with the awful script, made it difficult for me to finish watching the movie.

As for Samantha Morton, she was generally all right, but she overplays the spirited, independent part of Jane's character to the point of being downright rude to Rochester from time to time.  Still, at least her performance was less painful to watch than Ciaran Hinds'.  To summarize, the script and plot bore virtually no resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's original, and Ciaran Hinds' Rochester was a snarling bully, making this movie almost laughably bad.

If you want a good adapatation of Jane Eyre, watch the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  Yes, Dalton is too handsome to be a good Rochester physically, but more important than that is his performance, which shows the many facets of Rochester's personality -- not just non-stop anger.  The plot is kept intact (including the famous gypsy scene, which is omitted from this movie), and almost all of the dialogue is straight from the book.  I'll have to re-read the book and re-watch that adaptation of it to purge this movie from my memory!",1117843200,25,3325,4.714038128249567

This was the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre EVER!!!!!  There was NO chemistry between Jane and Mr. Edwards.  It was painful to watch them kiss, I'm not kidding!  The only good actress in the whole movie was Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Fairfax and is from Sense and Sensibility.  It is definetly a made for TV movie, and should have never been made into a DVD...if you prefer watching made for TV movies then you'll like it.  I recommend either the 1996 version or the 1944 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Helen.  This version misses all the important parts, quickly runs through her childhood, and skips her Aunt's death.  There is no emotion in this movie and it has no suspense at all.  Trust me, don't rent or watch it!!  I hope this was helpful.",1114732800,13,918,4.341176470588235

At that time, her Jane Eyre was the greatest performance by an actress I'd ever seen -- and I'm fairly savvy and discriminating, Peggy Ashcroft being the greatest I'd ever seen till I saw this tv film.  Many of the reviewers here seem to miss the point.  It doesn't matter whether the script is a scrupulous adaptation or not, or whether this actress is too plain, too pretty, or even if her interpretation doesn't match the picture of this famous literary heroine which you've got in your head.  The point is her incomparable performance -- what Shakespeare called ""the thing itself.""  Her greatest gift, among so many, is her seemingly effortless capacity, quietly and with extraordinary discipline and restraint in one so young (18 or 19 at the time), to break our hearts.  There's no one with comparable power and it is her gift to us, ""a largesse universal, like the sun.""  How Shakespeare would have loved her.",1109203200,23,1065,4.883333333333334
4713,1,0767020294,"I really disliked this version of Jane Eyre, so much so that I found myself skipping parts and pulling the movie out before finishing it. I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.

First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.

Overall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.",1107820800,7,2020,4.456756756756757

4724,2,0767020294,"When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's ""Jane Eyre"" movie, they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed.  The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s.  These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience.  I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.

The 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.

The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.

Dalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a ""poetic imagination."" Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane.  You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one.  A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience.  Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.

Other things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK.  The memorable theme music was the passionate ""Introduction and Allegro"" composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar.  My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast:  Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.

It's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. ""Jane Eyre"" is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of ""Jane Eyre"" is not ""bad,"" and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.

If you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try. Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.

There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found.  Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast.",1106352000,6,3801,4.904836193447738

4726,4,0767020294,"Cirian Hinds resonates with the dark, seething energy which is Mr. Rochester.  His portrayal is fantastic!  Samantha Morton is a fairly good Jane, and definitely meets the physical expectations of the small, plain governess.  This version is a good attempt at capturing the beautiful relationship shared by Jane and Mr. Rochester, but falls short, mainly I think due to time constraints.  It is impossible to cram all the plot development, intense dialogue and stirring emotion of this book into a 2 hour movie.  If you are wanting a more faithful portrayal of the book, check out the version with Timothy Dalton.

This includes not only some key plot points, but a lot of the best dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester as their relationship develops.

That said, I still think this is an enjoyable film, so long as you enjoy it in its own right and don't compare it to the book.  Both Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton commit to their roles with passion.  Like the characters in the novel, neither is conventionally beautiful; they are riveting because of the emotional force they bring to their parts.  At times, Hinds was a little too gruff as Rochester, but it never went over the top; he looked the part of Mr. Rochester and in my opinion acted it incredibly well.  And Samantha Morton is luminous - she may wear plain clothing and sport a ridiculous hair style, but she shines.  I did dislike some of the belabored dialogue the screenwriters introduced though.",1090108800,11,1018,4.648044692737431
4730,2,0767020294,"As a huge fan of the novel, I was very excited to try and find a film that would do it justice.  I had read the amazon.com reviews of this particular version, and in spite of some severely negative opinions, I decided to give it a try anyhow.
Well, let me just say to those with the poor reviews: ""I concur!!""
The child actors who play young jane and young Adele are not good at all.  Additionally, the character Adele - who is SUPPOSED to be 10 - looks to be at least 12 year old!  It was ridiculous.
Samantha Morton who portrays our heroine, Jane, does an fair job in the role.  She could have been a bit less attractive...yes, that's right, folks, just because a woman doesn't wear make-up and have a fancy hair-do doesn't necessarily make her unattractive!  Her portrayal of Jane was a little too impertenant.  Yes, Jane had spirit and professed her opinions honestly when asked, but the adult Jane was not openly confrontational and defiant in the way she was sometimes acted in this movie.  Her character was not done justice.
Cirian Hinds physically was a good Mr. Rochester, in my opinion.  He looked the part of the unattractive - even could be called ugly by some - large boned, tall man.  (I have seen him in ""Persuasion"" where is is the dashing Captain Wentworth, and looked purty darn hot I might add!  so kudos to his transforamation!) But it is a pity the likeness should end there.  He was made far too mean.  I don't remember him ever actually SCREAMING at Jane in the novel, yet he does it here frequently.  In the scene where they first meet, and Jane startles his horse, causing him to fall (they changed the setting and dialogue greatly in this scene by the way), he begins to scream at Jane, demanding and insisting she help him although she declines.
Isn't this a bit backwards?  Was Jane not the one insisting upon helping Mr. Rochester in the book??!
Anyhow, Mr. Rochester is a gruff, unpolished man towards her in the book, but they take it to extremes in the movie.  He is downright, plain old mean.
Additionally, his feelings towards Adele are much different than they are supposed to be.  In the book, of course, he is resentful of her presence and greatly irked by her.  He sends her away at every opportunity and never bestows her any real affection.  In the movie though, they have him asking for her, calling her to him, even setting her in his lap!  And, remember, this girl they have playing the supposed 10 year old Adele is more like 12 or 13!!  This makes for a fairly disturbing moment in itself!
They whiz through Jane's childhood with fair accuracy.  Condensing her childhood to being locked in the ""red room"" then being shipped away to school to face typhus.  It takes all of about 10 minutes for her to become 18 and leave to pursue her govenerss position.  Everything flies by you.  There are several scenes added in that are not in the book, but for the most part, it is done to provide the viewer background to better understand what is happening and why.  These scenes are basically dialogue between secondary charcters.
There is a scene where Mr. Rochester takes Jane into town to shop for the wedding clothes, and the run into Blanche Ingram.  That is the strangest addition - completely unnecessary, in my view!
Anyhow, after the wedding is called off, and Jane resigns to leave Thornfield, there is about 10 minutes of completely made-up dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  He does, in the end, actually start screaming at her!  He screams at her to leave!
Never - not in a million years! - would Mr. Rochester EVER tell Jane to leave!!  He even throws her bag after her!
They once again whiz through her three days of homeless wandering and begging, and her year spent with the Rivers's.  They completely leave out Maria Rivers's character altogether, and St. John is made a gregarious, pleasant, happy soul who smiles as he kindly asks Jane to marry him.  They pack all this into about 5 minutes.
She rushes back to Mr. Rochester after hearing him call to her on the wind, and about five minutes later it's all over, folks.
As far as some critizism of Mr. Rochester's healthy appearence at this point in the film (other than his blindness and mangled left hand - which was SUPPOSED to be gone altogether!), the book specifically notes Mr. Rochester is physically as strong and robust as he ever was.  Only his ""countenance"" has changed.  He is brooding and sad.  But physically, he is still strong and healthy looking. He is not supposed to look withered, sickly, and weak.  In that part, they again do Mr. Rochester physical justice.
In conclusion, the film may have been better had it been longer.  If they had more time to devote to the development of story lines, etc.  My other HUGE gripe is that they used SO LITTLE of Bronte's actual dialogue!!!  WHY???
AND they left out some VERY important scenes!
Just one example the springs to mind is the scene when Mr. Rochester is proposing to Jane.  So romantic, so climactic!  And yet, they not only use hardly ANY of the real dialogue, but the tree - the chestnut tree - is not struck by lightening!  HELLO!!  I'm not literature major here, but isn't that a prime example of what is called, 'foreshadowing'??  An indication of things to come?
They messed up one of the most romantic and climactic scenes in the entire book.
So, it's too short, hardly any dialogue is used, they change things that should not be changed, and add so many things that should not be added!
They have changed the characters' personalities and it has been for the worse.  They took EXTREME artistic license in making this movie, and I DO NOT like it one bit!!
It's not even a good movie in itself.  Even if you have never read the book or even heard of it...the way they rush through it all would leave a viewer completely confused.  I was constantly having to explain to my husband what was happening and why.

Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield?  Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and ""bumping into"" Blanche Ingram?  I don't think so! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes, the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable.  I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out, not given a major overhaul.
Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane (although Samantha Morton is too pretty.  Come on!  She can't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A&E version of ""Emma"" and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie!)  If you just like to watch good acting, you might like this.

While Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, I thought Ciaran Hinds was terrible as Mr. Rochester. He was far more blustery than smoldering, and the scene at which he screamed at Jane while she drove away disturbed me. He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion.
Also, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the part with St. John and Diana might have been left out for all the weight this movie gave it.
Overall, this is not an awful movie. However, it is inferior by far to other productions, notably the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt.",1044230400,19,1038,4.355670103092783

I was very dissapointed in their production of Jane Eyre. Key scenes were either altered, removed, or just poorly done. The entire gypsy scene was gone. How this major scene could possibly been taken out with thoughts that it would not be missed is beyond me.
This was a wonderful book but a bad movie when the two are compared. If you have not read the book then maybe you won't care about the ""alterations"", but I promise you that this is one of the greatest books ever written and will not be dissapointed by investing the extra time and effort of actually picking up a copy and reading it.",1042329600,2,748,4.35
4762,4,0767020294,"Yes, I've read Jane Eyre, for the first time when I was twelve.  And, yes, I liked the book.  But this movie isn't the book and I liked it as well.
One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils.
Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his ""grand passion"" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason.
Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.  Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played.
If I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book.  That does not mean I cannot enjoy another interpretation of the story.",1042329600,4,1302,4.359504132231405
4763,2,0767020294,"I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.",1041897600,6,1387,4.690082644628099

4765,2,0767020294,"While this production is worth renting, it is not faithful to the book because of its omissions, and I found Ciaran Hinds to be a very unsatisfactory Mr. Rochester.  The script highlighted his unsavory features (he is a deceiving adulterer, after all) to such an extent that his romantic and heroic qualities were insufficient to overcome the detriment to his character and likeability.  In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love.  I also felt that while Timothy Dalton looked too young in the part, Ciaran Hinds looked too old and a bit worse for wear.  The Timothy Dalton version is the most satisfying in terms of completion of plot.  It is indeed straight from the book, as someone noted, and what a book it is!  I think it takes quite some nerve to edit Charlotte Bronte to this extent.",1040256000,5,850,4.559210526315789
4766,2,0767020294,"Jane Eyre is one of my very favorite books, so I simply cannot like a film version that leaves out important details.  I liked it when I first saw it, but had the nagging feeling that something was missing.  So I re-read the book, and discovered exactly what was missing -- about 1/4 of the book.  Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield.
And then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.
Some have said that Timothy Dalton is ""too handsome"" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.  And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance.
An adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it.",1040083200,8,1224,4.448430493273543

It didn't show a gradual enough transition from ""Master and governess"" to ""in love"", and they might as well have skipped the whole part on St. John and his family for the insignificance it seemed to the whole movie.  Instead, they could have NOT skipped the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy (or whatever you call it.)  Overall I was very disappointed but then it could have been that the whole time I was comparing it to the BOOK and how much more heart-wrenching the book was!

4768,1,0767020294,"This adaptation of the marvelous novel ""Jane Eyre"" was an absolute punishment to watch. Such artistic liberties were taken with the characters in this film as to render them virtually unrecognizable. I can't recall any of the dialogue that was actually true to the book, and this was very disappointing as the strength of the story lies in the voices of the characters. I have no doubt that Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds would have done a marvelous job in their roles, were it not for the horrid writing and equally horrid direction. Mr. Rochester is so continually flying into a rage over something or other, that one wonders how Jane ever could have tolerated his company. And Jane speaks her mind in a much more opinionated and argumentative way then Charlotte Bronte ever allowed her to in the book. I also wonder why some of the most important scenes were completely ignored. Basically all of Jane's childhood is passed over in about 5 minutes, and thus the foundation of Jane's character cannot be truly understood. Also, the deathbed scene of Aunt Reed, and all the particulars of that family were passed over. And the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy, one of the most revealing and pivotal scenes in the story, was completely excluded. I would not recommend this film to anyone who has never read the book, as it simply does not do it justice. I also would not recommend it to any true lovers of this tale, as it is more likely to frustrate than to entertain.",1027900800,15,1492,4.67680608365019
4769,4,0767020294,"Well, I  just watched this movie today again after not seeing it for a couple of years and again I loved it.
No, it is not as true to the book as some other versions, but it captures the spirit and tells the story in a very compelling, moving-it-along way. I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.
I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well.
Ciran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!
The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered ""ugly."" Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel.
I highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre. Although not as true to the book as other versions, I think it included the most crucial scenes in a most convincing way. It was truly a fresh look at a classic and timeless novel.",1027382400,43,1594,4.796363636363636

Both were plain and some could say that Rochester was even ugly. The point is that their love was based on something higher and less superficial than beauty alone.

4782,4,0767020294,"A notion that a movie should be true to its literary predecessor is often unnecessarily emphasized. Some degree of creative freedom should be tolerated, especially if the result is as moving as this one. The omission of some significant points does not bother me, because the core of the interplay between the two main characters is sustained. The film doesn't deal with the heroine's spiritual developement; it is concentrated upon one, albeit the most important, aspect - her relationship with Rochester, and in that respect it is extremely successful. Chemistry between the leading actors is undeniable, and the developement of their characters' mutual affection is smooth, easy and beliveable, although it takes place within only a couple of scenes. Morton is a personification of the literary Jane - reserved yet emotional, insecure but brave. She makes her 'small Quaker-like' heroine as 'plain' as she possibly could. Since many of Charlotte's allusions to Jane's independence were omitted, it was necessary to make her more outspoken so that her true nature could be perceived. In the 'first-encounter scene' literary Jane is more assertive and thus sets the tone for her future relationship with Rochester. This blunder is remedied soon afterwards as the characters' verbal intercourse becomes more spicy and direct. Mistical connotations in the aforementioned filmed scene follow the surrealism of the novel, otherwise almost completely overlooked in the film. Hinds is a true Rochester, both physically and spiritually. He dominates the screen with his powerful personality: the original character is not at all handsome, he's often emotionally abusive, but still manages to be fascinatingly charismatic and sexually desireable. Hinds is a perfect image of a dangerous, romantic, imposing Byronic 'doomed hero', a rake eventually tamed and redeemed by marital love. Furtermore, this Rochester is even more understanding than his literary counterpart in relation to his mad, imprisoned wife. Regrettably, Blanche Ingram is (again!) blond and sophisticated, while she is supposed to be 'dark and majestic' - a beauty prototype which should remind us of Bertha Mason's former self. I welcome the omission of the gipsy scene; it is, after all, Charlotte's overly romantic and highly unbelievable diversion. The kiss, on the other hand, is a major disappointment - in this modernized and not at all timid version this climactic profession of love should have been rendered more realistically. It would have been the perfect icing on this romantic cake.",1014768000,4,2558,5.4296482412060305

If you read the novel, you would find this version offensive, and certainly a slap in the face to Charlotte Bronte. The acting is foul and gross in nature, the plot line is disjointed and patchy, the dialogue is laughable and all together wrong. If you want a good production, get either the Welles version (well done) or the BBC version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke (my personal favorite), but from this production flee now and flee far. However, I do have one good thing to say about this movie.  I teach Jane Eyre (the novel) at the High School level.  I have found that this version is useful for showing students just how far off a film production can be in comparison with the novel.  When I showed a clip of this version to my students after having them read chapter 12 (R-- falls off horse), the students began shaking with convulsive laughter, followed by a hailstorm of derisive remarks that peaked into a cumulative ""that's not how it is in the novel--that's awful!""",1010102400,10,1339,4.570833333333334

While this version (A&E's) of ""Jane Eyre"" sticks to the basic plot, much better than the William Hurt version does, the screenwriters got the characters all wrong.  In this version, Jane is much too forceful; she never would have spoken rudely to her employer as she does in this movie.

I was very disappointed in the way Jane seemed unable, for all her passionate words to actually kiss the man. I have seen Samantha Morton in other films & have liked her work immensely. In much of the dialog she shows true passion in her speaking but it seems that she could never really bring herself to kiss Mr Rochester on the lips, cheek-yes, lips-no, not really. If they weren't meant to kiss then the film could have done without the close-up camera views that made this so obvious to me. It seemed, to me, that a real kiss was avoided at every embrace. Even near the end of the movie when they were reunited with no impediments between them, professing their undying love, there was not one real kiss. The book was not portrayed true to form which so often happens when novels are made into movies but if you are going to film a passionate embrace & kiss to demonstrate a passionate love, shouldn't it be a real kiss?",1004227200,4,1235,4.304721030042918
4788,5,0767020294,"I've seen four film versions of this wonderfully romantic story and have read the book, but until Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton fleshed the characters so perfectly I've been very disappointed in the cardboard-surface interpretations of these two fated lovers. This is the only version I've seen that had ANY sort of passion - the kind of passionate love that must be fulfilled regardless of any obstacle. That's what the story is about isn't it? The passion shown by these two actors, as they become two of the most famous characters in literature, fairly flew off the screen and into my heart.
Of course, I first saw the stone-faced Orson Welles - Joan Fontain version - a really insipid Jane, but I loved her until Samantha came along - an impish Jane with spirited opinions she endeavors to hide - but fails. Her beauty shines through the plain-Jane hair and make-up and you know why Edward Rochester is willing to risk all to be with her. The other actress-Janes I won't bother to comment on!
Ciaran Hinds is an elusive blend of understanding tenderness and explosive passion - of course Rochester would be full of pent-up passions just waiting to be unleashed - with the kind of past he's led. And Ciaran certainly lets us feel what is in his heart and soul. I absolutely love the little-boy glimpse you get of Rochester as he confronts Jane in the driveway after she returns from the visit to her aunt.
As to the parts of the novel that were omitted, yes there were some - most of them cluttered the story - in my opinion. All right to read about but slowed the pace as too much extraneous padding in other film versions. A little editing after 150 years isn't always a bad thing!
I greatly admire actors who can portray their thoughts through the expressions that flit across their face. Most of this cast does this very well.  Mrs. Fairfax - Gemma - is priceless and she is also the best-cast of any I've seen. I've watched this version of Jane Eyre dozens of times. Ciaran Hinds was wonderful in ""Persuasion"" but, Oh My! he really shows his passionate Irish heritage in this film! I love it!",999302400,12,2103,4.5782493368700266

I was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in ""Persuasion"", was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist.
Please, if you have never seen ""Jane Eyre"", don't make this sorry mess your introduction to that magnificient novel. Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine did such a better job of it!",998524800,13,1078,4.832432432432433
4800,4,0767020294,"Having only seen the Timothy Dalton and William Hurt versions also, this is decidedly my favourite adaptation of the novel so far.
Although the Dalton and Clarke version is the most faithful rendition of the novel, I still can not help liking this adaptation more. Dalton's performance as Mr Rochester is superb and flawless but he is far too handsome for my liking. Clarke is just satisfactory - her Jane is too weak and bland. With respect to the Hurt and Gainsbourgh rendition, I was unfortunately quite bored after Anna Paquin departed from the screen. However, this was mainly attributed to improper screenplay and direction and  the lack of chemistry between the two lead characters.
After seeing Ciaran Hinds' brilliant performance in `Ivanhoe' and `Persuasion', I had to watch this version. However, I was quite disppointed as he portrays a rather savage, arrogant and simple Mr Rochester and fails to depict the absolute complexity and glamour of Bronte's character as others have mentioned in their reviews. For this I solely blame the directors though, for Hinds' undoubtedly has the capacity to provoke the audience in the same manner that Bronte's Mr Rochester does the reader ( - evidence from his numerous awesome performances clearly suggest so).
Samantha Morton is undeniably my favourite Jane though. She is far more vivacious and yet more solemn than Zelah Clarke and exudes much more passion than Charlotte Gainsbourgh (but for that I also blame misguided direction & screenplay engineered by Zeffirelly & Whitemore). Morton is perfect for the part and Hinds would be to if only proper direction was given and pivotal dialogue was included. Nevertheless, apart from these failures I still enjoyed this film.
Thus, if you want to see a good film, I definitely recommend this, but if you want to watch a totally true adaptation of Bronte's novel then it is better to see the Dalton and Clarke rendition.",998438400,7,1921,5.040880503144654
4801,1,0767020294,"Rochester has been one of my all time favorite heroes. Jane Eyre one of my all time favorite books and heroines. I read it almost yearly.
I am a fan of Ciaran Hinds (believe it or not). After seeing him in Ivanhoe, where he brought such a wonderful wounded, smokey edge to Gilbert, I remarked to a friend of mine, ""wouldn't he just be the penultimate Rochester?"" I was thrilled to find out shortly thereafter that this was going to be the case. Wow!!! I couldn't wait to see it.
And then I did.
What were the director and the scriptwriters thinking? After such a subtle moving proformance in Ivanhoe, Mr Hinds turns Rochester into a strutting, bellowing, obnoxious bully. Eu[...] Our Jane would NOT want this jerk. I was embarressed for him! Not to mention disappointed and sad for such a missed opportunity with this production.
The actress who played Jane did it passably well but still no great shakes.
And *where* did the writers get this dialogue? Did they have any clue what the book was about, or did they do the Cliff Notes and then write the screenplay, 'spicing' things up a little, just because? ....

Jane Eyre is a timeless story and it is beautifully captured in this gothic tale of romance and hidden secrets.  Each character is portrayed very well.

I have seen every version of this story and I believe that this is my favorite.  Ciaran Hinds is a fine actor and I do believe that his performance in this production needs a little more credit than usually given.  Rochester is a hard character to protray and given the script he did superbly.  Samantha Morton is by far the best Jane I have ever seen.  She can show more feelings in one expression of her face than I could do in a million years.

4804,2,0767020294,"I was so excited when I heard A&E was doing ""Jane Eyre,"" especially when I heard Ciaran Hinds was cast as Rochester. I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of ""Pride and Prejudice."" I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty!
My main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. ""I feel your passions are aroused""? I found myself screaming at the screen ""he'd never say that!""
My second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production.
I did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this). I just wish she'd been given better dialogue to speak.
The Timothy Dalton version remains my favorite. Too bad Hinds and Morton didn't have that script and that director!",987638400,18,1450,4.690196078431373

Samantha Morton as Jane can say about sixty contrasting things at once by turning her head. Rochester is perfect as well~ he's really quite funny in some scenes. While the whole cast is great (and the little girl Jane is wonderfully cute as well as talented) the two main actors just stand out and completely carry the film.

This version of Jane Eyre probably would have been more appealing for me had I not read the book for the third time when I rented this movie.  I have also seen the Orson Welles version but being that I am not a Welles fan I could not over look the man for the character.  The Timothy Dalton version was somewhat better for me since more of the story was put in the movie and then the Hinds version was most disappointing mainly because so much story line was left out and alterations were made. Although this version emphasises more the Rochester/Jane relationship I would have enjoyed it more if it had been more true to the story and spent more time on the relationship of the two characters. My advice would be to rent several versions before purchasing, especially if you read the book first.  I had set in my mind the perfect Jane and Mr. Rochester and doubt that I will ever find them in a movie adaptation.",985478400,10,1016,4.336842105263158

I have read the book multiple times, and none of the other actors I've seen quite fit the physical description. Ciaran Hinds is perfect. He fits perfectly. The man is amazing, and Samantha Morton is superb. She strikes the perfect balance between quietness and spirit. The only problem I had with it was the fact that they left out one of St. John's sisters. That is it. The chemistry between Hinds and Morton is unspeakably beautiful. I normally do not cry at movies, but this one leaves me weeping absolutely helplessly by the end. Edward Rochester is my favorite male character ever in any book I've ever read (and I've read quite a few). Ciaran Hinds captures the essence of Rochester.

So far I haven't seen a movie that really did justice to Bronte's Jane Eyre. Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester was too caustic and gruff, even for Bronte's version, and the playful relationship he had with little Adele was not true to the book. Ciaran was at his best in Jane Austen's Persuasion, which I recommend to anyone who liked this movie. The BEST Rochester was probably Orson Welles' portrayal. Unlike Welles' movie, this version included Jane's interaction with St. John, which was a bonus.

Scott did a very good, very restrained Rochester in his later version and this version presents a very good Rochester as well.  Morton as Jane Eyre confirms my earlier opinion from her performance in ""Sweet And Low Down"" that she is an actress to watch.  As far as faithfulness to the novel, I really don't demand that from films which are a very different creative medium from novels. The basic story has become a timeless classic, often copied but never equaled.  Jane is a poor orphan who becomes a governess for Rochester's ward.  He is a wealthy man with a beautiful estate.  They fall in love but a horrible dilemma from his past comes forth to haunt them both.

They only had this version of Jane Eyre and was hesitant to watch it because I had never heard of the actors before. As the movie started I noticed that  it skipped the beginning of the book (began at the red-room incident)and  spent more time towards Jane Eyre as an adult. When I first saw Ciaran  Hinds (Mr. Rochester) I thought - this man isn't very attractive and he is  really mean!  Jane Eyre will never fall for him! But, Mr. Hinds played the  role wonderfully and even I looked beyond his roughness and fell inlove  with the character!  Samantha Morton played a wonderful Jane Eyre and I  really felt the chemistry between the two throughout the movie.  I think my  favorite scene was when he was waiting for Jane to get back from preparing  for her aunts funeral and was very jealous.  And the ending made me cry!  I  later rented a different version of Jane Eyre with William Hurt in it, and  disliked it very much.  There was no chemistry between the lead actors and  I was glad that I rented this version first!",964569600,22,1093,4.407035175879397
4825,1,0767020294,"Jane Eyre is one of my all-time favorite stories, so I have leapt at the chance to see every  version ever filmed.
I was particularly anxious to see this one, produced by A&E, because, in my mind, they have a  deserved reputation for accuracy and for quality productions.  I have to  say, though, that this version was a terrible disappointment, not only  because of the time-constrained abridgement of the text, but because of the  portrayals of the lead characters.  In particular, the actor playing Mr.  Rochester portrayed him as a TOO angry, sneering, ranting, bellicose,  offensive man.  (I don't know whether I should blame the actor or the  director).  It was just asking too much of the viewer to believe that Jane  could find any redeeming qualities in him at all, let alone fall hopelessly  in love with him!
The most accurate and well-acted version of this  wonderful book, in my opinion, is the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version.  (It AMAZED me that someone actually found fault with this production  because that viewer thought that they took TOO MUCH script, verbatim, from  the book)! One of the most positive attributes of the Dalton/Clarke version  is that they remained true to Miss Bronte's ""script,"" and the  performances, right down through the supporting cast, were absolutely  superb!  It is the ONLY version which I've purchased for my collection; I  have also purchased three other copies to give as gifts to friends for  their viewing pleasure, and they agree that Dalton and Clarke ARE Rochester  and Jane!",962150400,13,1536,4.976284584980237
4826,5,0767020294,"This version is about as true to the book as a 2 hour adaptation can be. True, the Blanche Ingram in this version demonstrates that they even had bad dye jobs a hundred years ago, but it's better than Elle MacPherson (Oh  Mylanta!) as Blanche.
The movie is perfect, with the same gray and  gothic feel as the book, and Samantha Morton has the restraint and spine  you'd expect Jane to have.  If you've seen the movie on A&E but didn't  see it the first time it aired 3 years ago, you need to get a copy- there  are probably 20 minutes extra of scenes you've not seen yet (in particular,  a great scene of Jane and Edward in town where they run into Blanche and  her strange, Groucho eyebrows).
Every time I see the movie in the scene  by the tree where she pours her heart out to Edward, I lose it.  At the  end, he pours his heart out to him, I lose it.  My boyfriend even claims  that he ""almost"" lost it- and let me tell you, that's High Praise  from Mr. Pulp Fiction.
People will tell you it is romantic- and it is-  but not in a Fabio-with-the-hair-flowing kind of way. It's just genuine,  with a great chemistry between the actors that makes you believe these two  characters are in love in a deep, bonded kind of way.",960940800,3,1224,4.206896551724138

To me, there is no comparison between the two- the A & E version by far and away the most spectacular.  It  captured the true depth of the story. I thought Hinds, especially, was  fabulous.  The scene near the end when Mr. Rochester says:  ""But Jane,  I would die for want to see your face"" is so moving it brings the  tears flowing every time I see it.  The true depth of passion between the  two lovers came through so beautifully, in my opinion. Hinds is not  necessarily handsome which makes him wonderful for the role. It is the  beauty within our souls.  That message came through wonderfully in this  version. The script was also a fine piece of work.  I loved the beautiful,  poetic language.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who yearns for a  great love story.  The love between the two main characters is beautifully  portrayed within this film.",956966400,7,969,4.485549132947977

The Dalton/Clark version is by far the ""best"" and most thorough version and though Dalton, IMO, is too handsome to play Rochester,  Dalton's performance is outstanding, as is Clarke's as Jane.  Hinds and  Morton are my second favorites.  This version is missing vital pieces of  the story, but the performances of Morton and Hinds are quite acceptable  and good.  I like the comic aspect they added (the scene where Jane returns  from visiting w/her dying aunt) and Rochester is seated on the wall outside  Thornfield and he complains to her about her not having written to him.  Hinds melted my heart in this scene and I have been a fan ever since.  Morton is good as Jane and delivered her lines perfectly.

This is something you would want to watch over and over  again, if you are a romantic person, preferably an Austenite. However, the  adaptation is really loose, and important details from the book are  omitted. So if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, or watching the  movie to avoid reading the book, this is not the one. 83 version is very  loyal to the book, but they are almost reading from the book. 96 version is  generally loyal, but the omitted parts are the romantic parts, so where is  the fun? This one is the best one I have seen until now, but I will keep  looking for a miniseries that includes all the main details, and brings the  passion in the book alive.

The book  really has too much to be done within a 90 minute format. I wish people  would stop trying to squeeze months or years into hours. It just doesn't  work!

It seemed as  far-fetched and stereotyped as a harlequin romance. Plain virtuous orphan  girl becomes nanny/governess and meets rich macho employer and both fall in  love.  I was reminded of The Sound of Music, which is a great movie, but  rather too cliche. I really didn't expect to find a strong and believable  characters and plot.
Despite my reservations, because I think Ciaran  Hinds is one fine actor, and because I  generally enjoy period films and it  was a free rental, so I took it home.
I was immediately taken and drawn  in upon viewing, and within a few minutes I found myself bawling my eyes  out. The acting, scenery, sense of  momentum, sexual tension and romantic  longing  are intensely captivating. This is a very passionate film. I  couldn't get it out of my system for a few days, and have now read the  book.
I find that this screenplay'storyline is in some ways even more  captivating and poignant, and yet still quite believable, than the book! I  also find the mood, casting and the acting to both ring uncannily true to  the characterization and physical attributes as  described in the book.
The fact that there is alot of gothic mystery and classic retribution  gives the story genuine depth.
Despite the cliches of : attraction of  opposites, poor girl/rich man, young girl/older man... these things do  happen probably because of the strong  archetypal/socio-economic/psychological forces involved.
