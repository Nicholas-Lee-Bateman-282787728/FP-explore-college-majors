4154414,5,B003M8NGLW,My son loves Naruto Shippudon and is really enjoying these early stories. It helps him understand where the charecters came from.,1295222400,3,129,5.190476190476191
4154415,5,B003M8NGLW,"This is a Great Movie! I really recommend this to every Naruto fan! It has 29 Episodes(107-135) Over 12 Hours of NARUTO Action! It goes from when Sasuke is at the Hospital in the Hidden Leaf when he faced Naruto, all the way up until episode 135 'The End of Tears' which is the last episode of when Naruto and Sasuke face in the demon state. And also, it has all the episodes where it's Choji V.S. Jerobo, Neji V.S. Kimmariou, Kiba V.S. Sakon, Shikamaru V.S. Tiayua, Rock Lee V.S. Kimmario, and so on! It also swears alot, and theres lots of blood in this movie too! You Should Really GET this!! It's worth the money!

*UPDATE*
(Episodes: 108-135)
I mean episode 135 as in 'The Promise That Could Not Be Kept' which is AFTER Naruto and Sasuke fight. Kakashi Sensei comes along, shortly after Sasuke left and picks up Naruto. Naruto is still passed out after the fight, but when he finally wakes up, he hears the news about what happened to everyone else. Meanwhile, Choji, Neji, and Kiba are being treated to the medicare, while Shikamaru only has a broken finger. Tsunade comes out from Choji's room and tells Shikamaru that it was a Mission Failed. Shikamaru promises that he will do everything he can to take care of everyone and make sure the mission is a success next time.",1285977600,29,1278,4.508620689655173

4154555,5,B003M8NGLW,Naruto season 3. Vol 1 has 29 episodes.  (107-135) The box set itself is kind of cheap and the dvd is also cheap but at the price you pay is not really a big deal. Hope this review is helpful.,1405728000,,192,3.8
4154576,5,B003M8NGLW,"I love the Naruto series. I can never get enough! It's really hard to find popular anime that isn't really expensive. Not only is this box set reasonably priced but it comes with an English and sub version not to mention uncut. If your one of those people who love anime but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the way to go.",1405641600,,333,4.0606060606060606
4154577,5,B003M8NGLW,I like watching naruto so am collecting all the seasons of naruto from beginning to end.,1405641600,,88,4.5625
4154578,2,B003M8NGLW,"I consider myself to be a reasonably sane person. This means I never pay full price if I know it will be cut by half in a year, I do my research before an expensive purchase, and I look for the best deal in town. I found a deal here on Amazon which wasn't a once in a lifetime, but a once a year type of deal. I went for it and yet still felt like I overpaid. Even after shipping my purchase of this Naruto boxset ended up below $10 which is not as common as most deals(Not the best but not the worst either). In the end the content of the purchase must be worth the money spent, here it was not. While I usually avoid filler, here were a few episodes that I had enjoyed in the past. Nostalgia can be a very powerful thing, it can fool you into making the gravest of mistakes. Luckily, I got of pretty easy. Even so, I make it my business to warn others of the dangers of both filler and bad deals. My advice would be if you have an obsessive need to complete your Naruto Collection, wait for the price to dip below 2 or 3 dollars, otherwise, stay away from these filler boxsets. In the end, for about the price of a good burger, you have something that will last longer, but won't be nearly as satisfying.",1403308800,,1206,4.029166666666667
4154579,5,B003M8NGLW,Best series every. This is by far one of my most favorite and loved series. Has Great Action/Adventure/Fighting and a really great story plot. A must have for any anime fan :).,1399680000,,176,4.53125

4154584,3,B003M8NGLW,All 3 of the box sets are missing something like 57 episodes! I mean most a filler but you miss some that's important. In other words if you a fan and just eat to rewatch I'd get it if you're like me and trying to watch the first part of naruto for the fist time past the exams don't get it.,1393372800,,291,3.7868852459016393

4154619,5,B003M8NGLW,I would recommend any Naruto fans out there that I you are interesting in buying the complete series of the first part of the Naruto story then you should buy this dvd. It is way more affordable then buying the other volumes that is like up to like 16. I bought the whole series for under $100 compare to buying the whole box set that is worth over $200.,1387324800,,354,4.144927536231884

4154625,5,B003M8NGLW,I started buying the box sets for my son to watch since he lives ninjas  and so far he loves it!  already on season four. I buy between  Amazon best buy and Wal-Mart.  sometimes the other places has  sales going on. since I have a long way still to go  before we catch up I need the best price! ( son is 4  by the way if you are wondering what  age group  to aim for),1378771200,,367,3.723684210526316
4154646,5,B003M8NGLW,great product. i am a big fan of naruto and just having this collection is really great.  the product is really great.,1378598400,,118,4.363636363636363

4154648,5,B003M8NGLW,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew who loves Naruto but had never seen the whole series. I bought him this season and he has watched every episode back to back. He tells me every time how much he loves it, even forcing me to sit and watch it with him some times. And in all honesty it's pretty good. Funny. Intriguing. May have to sit down and watch it all beginning to end myself. Definitely a good series and most definitely a great buy!",1375833600,,442,4.091954022988506
4154649,5,B003M8NGLW,Exactly what it was supposed to be.  Naruto  is a very good series.  Very few anime's are good its good I got one of them.,1375747200,,122,3.8
4154650,5,B003M8NGLW,"If you have seen Naruto Shippuden and wonder where the series began, I strongly urge you to purchase these Naruto Box Sets. Purchasing these Box Sets are much cheaper than hunting for the Volume sets that orginally came out. If you are new to the series, like I am, you will want to collect these DVD sets. The discs are the same as these that appear inside the volume sets, yet these Box Sets contain double the episodes and are affordable. In fact, these DVDs are cheaper than the original sets.
Of course if you are new to the world of Naruto, you should watch the previous seasons before this one. Every episode of Naruto is great and full of great storytelling. The characters are mostly funny and comical, but at times the plot takes a much deeper and emotional route. The beginning of Season 3 (Season 3: Vol. 1) is pure action and no filler. Each episode advances the plot however, at times it moves a little slow. The rest of this season (Season 3: Vol. 2) is filler as well as all of Season 4. In other words, this is the last major story arc in the classic Naruto series. I'm sure if you are a huge Naruto fan like I am though, you will want to collect the entire series including all the filler episodes.
Although Naruto has appeared on kids' channels like Cartoon Network and Disney XD, it is not targeted towards children. These are Uncut episodes that leave the blood and cursing intact. Although its not as gruesome as a slasher horror film, it shouldn't be viewed by young children.
Overall, Naruto is a great anime series with a twisting and surprising plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Every character has a unique story to be told and explored. If you are unsure about Naruto, watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block on saturday nights. I guarantee you will be hooked!",1374883200,,1805,4.472727272727273
4154651,5,B003M8NGLW,Naruto was not exactly what I expected. I thought the story would be too immature. This was not the case the story was exciting with some comedic elements that could be considered childish but it did not distract from the story. The series has me hooked. I cannot get enough and I will most likely purchase the Naruto: Shippuden series.,1374624000,2,336,4.616666666666666
4154652,5,B003M8NGLW,I have been wanting to get this series for a long time. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.,1374278400,,102,3.9047619047619047
4154653,5,B003M8NGLW,"My husband is a Naruto fanatic! If this is his only vice, then I have nothing to do but meet his needs!",1373846400,,103,3.727272727272727
4154654,4,B003M8NGLW,"Naruto Season 3 Volume 2 contains episodes 136-163, which are all filler episodes containing stories that were never part of the manga series. A lot of fans did not like these filler episodes because these episodes did not continue the plot of the original manga. However, these episodes are really fun and entertaining. I really liked this boxed set. Now these episodes take place after the Sasuke Retrieval Arc and before Naruto leaves to train with Jiraiya at the end of Part 1 in the manga. And although I am a huge fan of Sasuke and the whole Sharingan mythology, I have to say that these episodes were very entertaining and nicely done. First of all, you get to follow Naruto on various adventures that are both funny and action packed. I love the manga as well as the first 135 episodes of Naruto, but these episodes have a nice lighter tone and features many characters that are overlooked or are background characters in the first 135 episodes. There is an arc featuring Naruto joining Shino and the rest of Team 8; Naruto teams up with Iruka in the Return of Mizuki arc; and Sakura has a character defining moment in the Rice Country arc. Now these episodes are not as intense as the Sasuke Retrieval arc, or the Land of the Waves arc, but these are still classic Naruto episodes. So, if you genuinely love the Naruto series (anime, manga) then these episodes are must have. However some cons of this box set are: No Sasuke at all; Kakashi makes appearances but does not fight; Gaara and the Sand Ninja have a brief cameo (I like the Sand ninja, but they reappear in Season Four volume 2 I believe); and it can get annoying at times because for the first four arcs each mission has an underlying motive to find Sasuke even though all the viewers know that he is not coming back. This item is still worth the purchase and I truly enjoyed it.",1373673600,4,1850,4.508928571428571

4154697,4,B003M8NGLW,"My fiance and I just recently got into Naruto, a bit late sure but whatever. I loved watching shows like DBZ and Yu-Yu Hakasho growing up and I've always heard great things about Naruto. We've been on quite the anime kick for awhile now and really wanted to give Naruto a try, so we did. We're enjoying it quite a lot. It's funny, action-packed, and has a lot of heart. There are moments here and there where, let's just say, it takes 5-6 episodes to advance the plot in any small way, and sometimes single fights can take multiple disks. I'm all for the epicness (like I said, I love(ed) DBZ and that show is probably quite a bit worse at prolonged fight sequences than Naruto is), but sometimes it's just a bit too much and if you are a person that has trouble sitting through ""too much"" fighting, you may have trouble keeping interested here and there. My only real problem with these box sets is that nearly every episode begins by replaying 5-10 minutes of the previous episode before actually continuing. It's probably worse because we like to watch many episodes at a time when we get a chance, but it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING to see the same scene twice, and fast-forwarding at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE EPISODE is getting old reallllly fast. That said, it's been a blast so far and I recommend it to anyone who loves anime (especially ""fighting"" anime) and hasn't been too turned off by anything I've said here.",1366156800,,1421,4.533073929961089

4154750,5,B003M8NGLW,I believe this part of naruto is a very emotional part. I swear the first time I seen the episode where sakura was pleading for sasuke to stay in the park at night I was getting teary eyed lol especially in the Japanese version. But this part of naruto is the beginning of sasuke turning into the man hes suppose to be. It almost reminds me of the whole star wars anakin turning dark side thing.,1349308800,2,395,4.2105263157894735
4154751,3,B003M8NGLW,After sasuke leaves the naruto show definitely tended to have its moments when you would rather watch sonic x. But of course as with every anime series what is the point to buy all the narutos without every single season box. The thing I don't understand tho is out of all the box set volumes y would they make this one the most expensive. But yeah buy dis dvd set to continue your naruto collection.,1348531200,,400,4.346666666666667
4154752,3,B003M8NGLW,"This is not a bad set, unfortunately after finishing the box set last night, I must say it is the most boring.  Now, if you are like me and refuse to not have an entire show, start to end, we must buy it.  But if you are on a budget, or just not as OCD as me, you can go without this disk set.

The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, the third disc contains five episodes and bonus features, the fourth disc contains five episodes, the fifth disc contains five episodes, and the sixth disc contains five episodes and bonus features.

Just like the previous four boxes in this set of Naruto releases, this is a ""bare bones"" release; there are no booklets or inserts included in the box.  When it comes to the actual discs included in this set, they are exactly the same as the discs that were released in the Naruto Uncut Box Set 9 and Naruto Uncut Box Set 10 box sets.

The first bonus feature on the third disc is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview for Naruto Uncut Box Set 10, which runs for roughly three minutes; it should be noted that the audio for the preview is mastered lower than the episodes on the disc.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and twelve.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.  Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled as ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine and Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.

The first bonus feature on the sixth disc is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview for Naruto Uncut Box Set 11, which runs for roughly three and a half minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and twenty-eight.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.  Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.

If you enjoy Naruto and haven't already purchased the Naruto Uncut sets, this would be an economical way to get the episodes on DVD in order to add them to your collection.  You get double the amount of the content of the original sets, but you pay about the same amount as you would have for the original Naruto Uncut DVD box sets.  However, if you do purchase this set, just be aware that this is simply a repackaging of Naruto Uncut Box Set 9 and Naruto Uncut Box Set 10.  All Viz Media really did to change the discs was to make minor changes to the labels on the physical discs included in the set.

4154811,5,B003M8NGLW,"This is an absolutely essential set for any true Naruto fan. It begins on Episode 107 which is the very beginning of the ""Sasuke retrieval arc"" where Sasuke is in the hospital recovering from his battle in the previous filler. And goes all the way to episode 135 where he has left the Hidden Leaf village and beaten Naruto in the epic battle at the Final Valley(Or Valley of the End for people who have seen the Japanese version). This is personally my favorite arc so I am very glad to see the entire thing in one box set. If you were to get the original season box sets this whole thing would literally cost twice as much. So its a much better deal. I would recommend this to any Naruto fan looking to complete their collection.",1303171200,9,730,4.335766423357664

4154813,4,B003M8NGLW,"I know a lot of people complain when it comes to filler episodes.  I agree most of the time. Staying right no track with the story is always the best, however, I actually enjoy watching the Naruto fillers.  Some of them are kind of a waste, but others I find to be truly funny and really enjoy. I really enjoyed this box set. It kept my interest the entire time. I thought they did a good job trying to incorporate fillers with the storyline. It is still entertaining and worth the buy I think. Especially since you are getting 6 discs for the price of one box set! You can't beat that! I would definitely recommend this set!",1296518400,9,625,4.288135593220339
