8382549,5,B002VVQ7US,"Siegfried and Roy were destined to meet and perform the magic they have brought to millions of people.  Their story is as interesting as any movie you might watch or novel you might read.  Siegfried was drawn to ""magic"" as a young boy.  And, as a young boy, Roy loved animals and had special talents for communicating with them.  The two met on a cruise ship where Roy signed on as help and managed to sneak his beloved cheetah on the ship with him and Siegfried was hired to as an entertainer.  Their magic show began on that ship after Siegfried boasted he could make anything disappear and Roy challenged him to prove it by making his cheetah disappear.  If you ever enjoyed the magic these two men bring to the stage you will love this DVD.",1371340800,3,744,4.394160583941606
