7587885,5,B01A0IF20E,"Fantastic, behind- the- scenes look at Pentatonix,  the best thing that has ever happened to a capella music. They bring modern day influences, crazy dance beats and refreshing sounds using only their voices. Not only do they bring awesome cover arrangements of today's most popular music, they also offer original material as well. Well worth your money and time!",1463011200,8,364,5.169491525423729

7587890,3,B01A0IF20E,"I loved the documentary.  But I bought the newest one because I understand that new pictures would be added to what was already there.  If there were new pictures those at the end I think, we have all seen them multiple times.  There was nothing new about them.  So that was disappointing.  The documentary itself was brilliant.  Five stars for the documentary and three stars for new added pictures.",1461369600,3,400,4.72463768115942

7587907,5,B01A0IF20E,"If you love Pentatonix, of course you will love this video.  Fun to watch them evolve and grow throughout the tour, and esp enjoyed seeing their childhood adventures in the world of music.  Some of the 'behind the scenes' moments are a bit drawn out and overdone, but you can fast forward through those, and in general, lots of fun to watch.  The bloopers were disappointing, as they were not that different from the video itself - since they were pretty loose to begin with, so the bloopers seemed to be mostly just messed up text, etc.
In general, a great choice for anyone who loves Pentatonix, or for someone who needs to be introduced to them!",1490313600,4,648,4.521367521367521
7587908,1,B01A0IF20E,"Not happy... Played through my computer, the dvd will not play full screen and played on my dvd player attached to the HD tv, there is a terrible background hiss we determined was not due to the tv or dvd player. (Other dvds play fine)

The ad gives you the impressioin there is more concert footage in this. It is not and what there is could only be described as mildly interesting. Don't waste your money on this one.",1490140800,,419,4.30379746835443

Really goes in depth, as to what the band does inside the tour, plus getting a glimpse of their families that have supported them for so long. In another 6 years, they'll have enough grammy's for another  pay raise with RCA Records.",1472169600,5,271,4.645833333333333

7587937,4,B01A0IF20E,"This was a pretty good behind the scenes video of the group. Though I'm just a fan (not a crazy,wild fan like a lot of others) it was interesting to see how the members react to each other and their audience. It was interesting to see how they honestly couldn't believe their popularity. They haven't let their fame go to their heads yet. I thought the video ran a bit long and started becoming boring (I skipped 3 of the chapters). I recommend it to fans to at least rent or buy and then watch once and pass it on.",1469923200,10,515,4.16
