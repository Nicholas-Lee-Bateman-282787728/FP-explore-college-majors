4886870,5,B005SSU39M,"Have the first concert of the 2 on this BD, on DVD, this Blu-ray blows that far away. The picture is very good, but it is the DTS HD MA sound that make this a must have for Isaak fans. (Pity those who can't access the HD Sound!) Better than having his band there live in your living Room (Takes up less space). Regards from OZ",1326240000,10,326,3.9545454545454546

4886885,5,B005SSU39M,"Chris is an all time favorite of mine and I have all his albums. I was lucky enough to get stage side seats at one of his concerts and of course I was not disappointed. He's as good today as he was over twenty years ago. If you're a Chris Isaak fan, this is a must have video package. This is actually two different events plus extras.  GREAT!!!",1410134400,3,345,4.073529411764706

4886894,2,B005SSU39M,"It would be a terrific DVD if it had some music along with the stage show.  Their mouth goes and the band plays but there is no sound.  There are the songs that they play on another track, but no picture to go with them.  It is really weird!",1387497600,,241,3.877551020408163

4886900,5,B005SSU39M,"AS usual, Chris Issak and his band find a way to embellish the songs in their own special way, and the performance does not dissapoint",1370044800,,134,4.4

4886902,1,B005SSU39M,"This disc requires equipment capable of decoding dolby audio. Tried on 2 different DVD players, a desktop pc and a brand new Lenovo laptop and they would not play the concert audio. Audio on the menus plays fine but as soon as the concert starts, silence. Confirm your equipments capabilities before you consider this one otherwise you'll be disappointed.",1356912000,5,355,5.033898305084746
4886903,5,B005SSU39M,This Blu-ray captures a Chris Isaak show very well. I have seen Chris numerous times and this is a very solid performance of a good (if not predictable) playlist. The sound reproduction is excellent; the camera shot selections were generally good. My only criticism is that there is some bleed on the video images where blue stage lighting appears to obscure facial features. All in all a great video that can be watched/listened to numerous times.,1356739200,5,448,4.907894736842105
4886904,5,B005SSU39M,"I gave this as a gift so I didn't get a chance to watch it. But hey, Chris Isaak is great and gets five stars regardless!",1356566400,,121,3.6923076923076925
4886905,4,B005SSU39M,"Video Quality is great, not perfect but very good... Audio is awesome, playing the home theater bluray makes you feel like you're in the concert.

I miss a few songs not included...",1352764800,,181,4.65625
4886906,5,B005SSU39M,"Chris Isaak is not a bad singer, but he's more my wife's type than mine.  This was a gift.  I recommend it to CI fans everywhere!",1344643200,,129,3.923076923076923
4886907,5,B005SSU39M,"My girlfriend told me to buy this after I revamped my sound system. I never heard of the guy, but whoah.. he has a great sound and a unique (somewhat cocky) style. Its got two concerts, the first one is better than the second... primarily because the sound is very high quality and rocks the house. I love it... one of my favorites. Soundstage did a good job on this one.",1336867200,2,371,4.23943661971831
4886908,5,B005SSU39M,"Once I got the sound to work (had to select dolby) the concert was great.  There are 2 concerts on the DVD.  The first one, Chris is wonderful of course but seems a little tense.  The second concert on the DVD Chris and the Band Members seem more at ease and having more fun.  All the songs are wonderful and there is always humor shown in his concerts.  If you like Chris, you will love the DVD.",1336694400,4,396,4.090909090909091
4886909,1,B005SSU39M,"Would have loved to have watched Chris but the DVD was defective; it would not play in either a DVD player nor computer. The main menu had sound but both concerts were silent.
