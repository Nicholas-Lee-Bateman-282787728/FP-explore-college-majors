8154763,5,B000K7UHHY,The fan I gave this to loved it. They have watched this over and over. I would recommend this for fans on your gift list,1368748800,,120,3.84
8154764,4,B000K7UHHY,"This is a solid addition to any KU fan's collection or anyone whom enjoys the game of basketball and wants to learn about one of the best venues that it's played in.

Overall it's a decent video and covers topics from former stars such as Wilt Chamberlain who have been there, current and former coaches and players talking about their experiances there, and the history of the building.

The bad though is as mentioned in another review it is clearly a made for TV film and is rather short, the bonus features are almost the same as rewatching the main feature just with a little bit of extra info, and it's older. It's from right after the Booth Hall of Athletics additions so there's alot of mention of the number of championships but it's before the 2008 one.",1361059200,,763,4.521739130434782
8154765,5,B000K7UHHY,THIS IS AN EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE DVD ABOUT THE HISTORY OF FOGG-ALLEN FIELDHOUSE AND SHOULD BE A PART OF ANY KU FAN'S COLLECTION,1240099200,,127,4.818181818181818
8154766,3,B000K7UHHY,"Those considering this DVD should be aware that it is essentially a 30-minute made-for-tv feature.  It is quite well done and includes brief comments by Danny Manning and others but it's actual run time is certainly NOT 90 minutes, as advertised.  It has a number of tacked-on ""extras"" which may bring the total time to 90 minutes. However, the feature itself is a half-hour or so, at most.  Probably for die-hard Jayhawks, at the price.",1199491200,2,437,4.8
