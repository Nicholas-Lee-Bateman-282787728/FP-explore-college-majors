3000348,4,B000XBPDY4,"This a pleasant way to spend an evening. Well written and well acted. Sometimes ""true justice"" is outside the legal system.",1211241600,3,123,4.904761904761905
3000349,2,B000XBPDY4,"The story lines of the two seasons were excellent, as well as the acting.  Having seen these originally on TV, however, it appears some of the Mystery intros were deleted.  Also, the DVD production quality was very poor:  there were pauses, skips, and what might be slippages in both sets.  I doubt I would purchase any DVDs from this production company again.",1204761600,12,360,4.758064516129032
3000350,5,B000XBPDY4,"Cordelia Gray is a private detective with ""feelings.""  She takes on weird cases and wins.  She learns the ropes from her mentor, a disgraced ex-policeman. It is very good.  Women detectives are different from the men detectives in British mysteries.  They could take on the same case, and have a different view.",1201132800,20,311,4.923076923076923
3000351,4,B000XBPDY4,"This is actually four specials base on PD James books.  Series 1A is Suicide is presented in three one hour episodes.  Cordelia Gray has just inherited a detective agency when her boss dies.  Her first case is the death, apparent suicide, of a scientists college-dropout son.  But like all PD James mysteries, things are not as clear cut as they seem.

But this goes deeper than just a mystery.  Just like Prime Suspect, Unsuitable Job for a Lady is also about a woman in a profession that is dominated by men.  But unlike PS, UJL's heroine is not a tough as nails detective but a woman feeling her way around a man's jungle without upsetting too many people.

Series 1B is A Last Embrace presented in three parts. Cordelia is hired by the wife of the owner of the Claircourt Park Hotel to investigate her husband sexual harassment of the female staff. Cordelia goes undercover as help at the hotel but when she arrives her client has disappeared.

Series 2 is two specials.  In first Living on Risk, Cordelia is hired to follow a man but the question is he a killer or a victim.  In the second, Playing God, Cordelia is hired by DCI Ferguson to investigate his daughter's boyfriend but things take a bizarre twist when the daughter hires Cordelia to continue her investigation after DCI fires her.

Helen Baxendale is perfect as Cordelia.  While is sweet and vulnerable, she is also inately sharp.  Annette Crosbie is the office manager but being a two person office often gets involved with the case and Cordelia's life.

This is definitely a great show and features one future star (Baxendale) and one seasoned vetran (Crosbie.)",1200441600,56,1631,4.693661971830986
3000352,4,B000XBPDY4,"Great series revolving around Private Investigator Cordelia Grey, played ever so well by the wonderful Helen Baxendale (Friends, Cold Feet).  In Series 1, she takes over the business after her employer dies unexpectedly and runs into some cases of her own. The second, Series 2, involves the still-sharp Cordy but with a catch - she's pregnant! Dealing with this and a bizarre case, she muddles through all the while keeping the audience in suspense.

All in all, a lovely series, very rare, so watch/own it while you can!",1153094400,,522,4.920454545454546

3000354,4,B000XBPDY4,We enjoyed watching these stories very much. It's an interesting idea for good mystery entertainment. There should have been more where these came from.,1385251200,,152,5.375
3000355,2,B000XBPDY4,"Disappointing.  Don't waste your money.  Unbelievably poor acting, plot is lousy, like it was written by a 12 year old.  The hugely pregnant Helen Baxendale waddling around pretending to be a P.I. was an insult to the viewer.  Helen Baxendale appeared to be totally bored with the entire movie.  She was also consistently insulting to her older secretary.",1384905600,,355,5.051724137931035
3000356,3,B000XBPDY4,"I'll begin by saying that I am a huge BBC, Masterpiece Theater, & Mystery! fan; this review is not intended as a criticism of those wonderful productions in general. While this review will contrast somewhat with the others I've read here, I need to say that I have not read the P. D. James work on which this series is based. Therefore, I cannot speak on the original protagonist, but only on the character's portrayal in this dvd. Helen Baxendale, the actress portraying Cordelia Gray, is obviously beautiful and not without talent. Her portrayal of Cordelia as a private investigator, however, seems to fall short, and I'm not sure if the fault lies in her acting, the direction, the adaptation to film, or in the original work. As mentioned, I have not read these particular stories, but I find it odd that a mystery writer would create a PI - even a novice - who acted as ridiculously stupid as the Cordelia portrayed in the series. Supposedly, her mentor, Bernie Pryde, trained her because he saw her potential, but she seems to take silly risks with a somewhat cavalier & clueless attitude that does not ring true for an investigator. Her attempts at subterfuge come across as suspicious, making her, rather than others, appear suspicious. Ms Baxendale's Cordelia isn't half as believable or intriguing as Inspector Morse, Miss Marple, Inspector Lynley, Hercule Poirot, Inspector Lewis, or even Lewis's or Lynley's sergeants, all of whom are essentially endearing, both while attempting to solve cases and while fighting their own personal battles.  This Cordelia lacks that quality that makes me empathize or even sympathize with her, her cases, or her ""issues."" Throughout the two series I watched (1 & 2), I often found myself thinking, ""How ridiculous!"" or ""No PI - even a rookie - would do that; who would?!"" As to the quality of the dvd format, I found no fault at all. My disappointment was with the content. I'll watch those aforementioned detectives solve their cases over & over; however, I don't want to waste my time on another series with Ms Baxendale's Cordelia Gray.  I only gave this series three stars because the other actors' performances were so outstanding.",1377993600,,2184,4.9
3000357,4,B000XBPDY4,"I love all these UK crime programs, this one is a bit dated and some of the story lines are a bit hard to believe, but I liked it.

3000359,5,B000XBPDY4,I first saw this series while I was working out of the good old USA.  Another great series with fine acting and well plotted stories.  Amazon once again delivered the series early and perfectly packaged.,1364083200,2,203,4.771428571428571

3000363,4,B000XBPDY4,An old but interesting series. alway enjoy watching Helen has very good story lines especially the original one. Shame it did not go for longer but I guess Helen got busy doing other things ( she is pregnant in second series),1345075200,,225,4.512195121951219
3000364,3,B000XBPDY4,"Helen Baxendale and Annette Crosby are absolutely convincing in this gritty series, they brilliantly convey a range of nuance, and deserve 5 stars. But the material is problematic, with unfortunate discontinuities, and drastic changes in the set's offices and homes that viewers aren't supposed to notice, among other issues. Viewer Alert: The only way to watch the wonderful introductions by Diana Rigg, featuring Edward Gorey's deliciously macabre artwork, is to select by episode, separately. Don't choose ""Play All,"" or you'll get awkward transitions between each mystery's episodes, with bits clumsily cut-out and very odd pacing. The friendship between the women is refreshing, surviving awkward moments. One can only wish the duo of ""An Unsuitable Job"" had continued, with more and better stories.

8227727,4,B000XBPDY4,"Very interesting, as this series is presented from the female perspective. As a woman, Cordelia  is much more at risk than male detectives usually are. Cordelia and Edith have a very unusual, but very successful partnership.",1414713600,,224,5.222222222222222

8227729,4,B000XBPDY4,"Helen Baxendale portrays a young woman, somehow becoming a private investigator in London--a typically male-dominated profession.  She'd been apprenticing for 8 months to senior ex-policeman who had been pushed out of the ""Met"" into private investigations.  Our protagonist has learned lots, but not all, about the ""game"".  She is intuitive and can cut through the layers of deception suspects and witnesses often provide.  Yet there is a somewhat naive or gullible side to her nature, allowing her to make mistakes.  But she learns from them.  The emotionality of the protagonist is initially distanced and nonempathetic.  As the episodes develop, emotional growth is slowly coming to her.  I suppose the series could have gone another season or two, allowing us to see more of the blossoming of her personality.  The writing is fine.  The setting has ""noir"" quality, bleak and somber.",1398902400,,886,5.264285714285714
8227730,5,B000XBPDY4,"Helen Baxendale plays Cordelia Gray as an introspective and cautious person who is nonetheless determined and focused - it's such a difference from the usual female detective we see on TV - smart, sassy, extrovert, and glamorous. Cordelia is a person the audience will care about; her vulnerability conceals her enormous capacity to persist until issues are solved. She is a believable, quietly spoken and careful person who is totally believable, in this age of super-detectives who seem to 'have it all' except, perhaps, a certain plausibility.",1393200000,,546,5.287356321839081
