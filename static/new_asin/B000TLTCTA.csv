2906817,5,B000TLTCTA,Have waited for months..... did not disappoint. LOVE this show!!!! Too bad the series ended. Thankfully it's in syndication and I can watch it on 2 different stations AND on DVD. It is a must during my daily workout sessions.,1193270400,,225,4.65
2906818,5,B000TLTCTA,"I watch these shows almost everyday, I love it! I was so happy and excited to finally have season 7, I think I pre-ordered it over two months ago! I will undoubtedly get season 8 from you. Thank you! Also, I agree that the last season is a little different and not as funny, but it lost 2 important characters, but as for season 7.... its wonderful!",1192665600,2,349,4.223880597014926
2906819,5,B000TLTCTA,Awesome. It's a great dvd. It should be bought by any fan of That 70's Show.,1192665600,,76,3.8125
2906820,4,B000TLTCTA,"I can't wait to add this to my collection! I am a complete 70s Show addict! I watch an episode almost daily and can't get enough of all re-runs on TV. Although, I will say that as the series winds to an end it does lose some of it's earlier zest. Who care? I love the show!!",1190937600,2,274,3.824561403508772
2906821,3,B000TLTCTA,"I still enjoy watching this show and will certainly buy this set for my collection, but I should say that this season is by far not the best. For anyone who is new to the show: buy either season 1,2 or 3. Those episodes were hilarious!
After having been on the air for so many years, one just can't expect That '70s Show to still have fresh ideas all the time.
The plotlines really are less interesting and significant this time around. All of the characters are grown up now and they lack the on-screen chemistry they used to have.
However- It is still worth purchasing, for the fans, because it's the last season with the entire cast still intact before Eric and Kelso leave in Season 8.",1188777600,13,689,4.390625
2906822,5,B000TLTCTA,"Giving the season a 1 star review because the hair color is wrong on the front box is ridiculous! First, I am sure that it will b fixed and if not, who friggin' cares! The show is great!!! Even though this wasn't their finest season, it's still hilarious, entertaining and crucial to any collection. It was a brilliant series.

2906823,5,B000TLTCTA,"That 70s Show is quite possibly one of the greatest sitcoms fox ever produced. Season 7 is just another hilarious ventures into the 70s. Donna dyes her hai blonde and looks finer than ever and she and Eric are past the whole lets get married phase and the gang is back to their old antics and new ones. This probably should have been the last season, but the show was still very strong with plenty of laughs.",1186617600,11,408,4.311688311688312

2906831,1,B000TLTCTA,"I hate to say anything negative here but in this case I have to make an exception. I wouldn't even give this one star if I could.
The company that put these out did a HORRIBLE job. If you can find them - get the ones put out by 20th Century Fox released in 2004 - 2007 (I think). If you already have half the series in one and then get the rest in these ""New"" versions"" do what I did, play the exact same episode from both versions and look at the grain - holy crap! It is like night and day. I mean, don't get me wrong - the 20th Century Fox version isn't perfect but what it is - is sharper and clearer and very, very small grain - in comparison. I returned 4 seasons of this version and went online and bought the same 2 seasons at a used place and they are just fine. Now I have all seasons - same quality.",1438128000,,810,3.856287425149701

If you have enjoyed other seasons of That '70s Show then I would recommend this one to you but if its your first then I would recommend starting at number one so that you can see everyone grow up and shape their relationships with each other. As with every season this is filled with lots of humor and fun story lines.,1400457600,,437,4.214285714285714

2906860,5,B000TLTCTA,"This show was funny from season one up to 8 when they did what most good shows do. They started to replace main characters with add ins.

This season really got me laughing by episode two. It barely had any episodes that weren't great. Introducing Hyde's dad was funny too, and it makes sense. A lot more changes in this season, to give it something fresh. Red owns a Muffler Shop, Hyde works/owns a Record Store, the whole Eric & Donna marriage thing is settled. Just a lot more interesting to me than Season 6. I still liked S6, just not as much as other seasons. It had it's hysterical episodes, just not as many as this one to me.",1254528000,4,638,4.461538461538462

This is a great show. Brings you back to your teen years. Even if you did not resemble these kids, you know you knew a few people back in school that did. I never watched it until I caught the reruns of it and I was instantly hooked and had to own the series.

2906914,4,B000TLTCTA,This is a good season.  Some of the episodes were very funny and bringing back chong and was a good move for the show.  This should have been the last season though.  There is no way that the remaining characters could have continued the show on their own.  It would have been a different story if they added some strong characters but bringing in randy was a mistake.  I think this is the season where Wilmer(Fez) starts to lose his ability to deliver lines.,1199836800,5,459,4.416666666666667
2906915,4,B000TLTCTA,"I love That 70's Show: it's one of my all-time favorite shows, thanks to the hilarious characters and bold stances they took on some of the common problems people were going through during that period in American history. That being said, though, this was the season where I started to lose interest and stop watching. It wasn't so much due to poor storylines or acting (although some of the ideas weren't that great, and in some scenes it was pretty obvious that Topher Grace was ready to leave), but rather because the creative team had exhausted most of the controversial issues that defined the 70's, leaving them with no sure things to turn into funny stories. Needless to say, the show reflects this in a negative way, and it suffers because of it. There are still quite a few highlight moments (Eric & Donna's reconciliation after the marriage fiasco is a particularly touching one, and the Eric & Kelso goodbye scene in the season finale was hilarious), but they can't make up for the uninspired mush in between. All in all, if you're a 70's Show fan like I am (and also own the previous six seasons on DVD), there's no reason not to pick up this set: just don't expect TV gold like its earlier seasons.",1196985600,3,1211,4.585253456221198

I'm hoping either they put all the extra's like the 100th episode, and the KISS episode on the Season 8 DVD's or come out with a separate DVD with all the extras that were missed.

Downside...sometimes you will have to switch from widescreen to normal. And back again for the next episode. A few episodes are less than good quality...but in my memory it seems it was the same on television. Don't quote me on that.

5 stars for the show.
3 stars for the fact of there being poor quality and having to switch screen modes.
