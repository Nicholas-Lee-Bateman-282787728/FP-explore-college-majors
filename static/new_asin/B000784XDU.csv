It was strong on ethic, son regarding father, and a little humor was injected by  old cowboy sidekick Fuzzy Knight (playing the part of 'Private Fuzzy Knight, the 55 year old legionaire ').",1141948800,9,357,4.819672131147541

8045653,2,B000784XDU,"Well, there was a nostalgic effect here. But otherwise it was just a low budget, black and white show from the 1950s. The scenes shot in Morocco were used repeatedly. These were long shots so you could not tell who was riding that horse or that camel. These were interposed between scenes shot in Hollywood. The best thing about the series was the marching song of the French Foreign Legion, Le Boudin. It means The Blood Sausage which was what the soldiers called the bedroll they had their knapsacks. It is a stirring composition.",1406851200,,532,4.670212765957447

8045655,5,B000784XDU,"Shades of pop culture boy did I enjoy these episodes seeing them again today.
An amazing look at the attitudes toward the Middle East, Arabs and terrorists when fighting them was considered heroic. I hope they release the entire series! This series was made with cooperation of the French military i.e. The French Foreign Legion and actually cast and used real military in speaking roles. A great piece of pre-non p.c. pop culture. Buster Crabbe is great and so is Fuzzy Knight. Enjoy!",1204761600,5,485,4.855421686746988
