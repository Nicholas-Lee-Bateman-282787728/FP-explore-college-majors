This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,,920,4.317919075144508
8270756,5,B0018RCN1S,"i will say this now......SPOILER ALERT......i normally do not tell about major points in my reviews, but this one i have to do some in order to tell the story.

the first episode starts the second part of Sia taking Rin out, playing hooky from school and making him VERY unconfortable (trust me this is one you want to see).  She pretty much throws herself at Rin, but when the advances get rebuffed the Dark Sia (known as kykiou) runs home.  Later we learn that she is actually Sia's twin sister that was absorbed while in the womb and just became a part of her.  the second episode Sia and Rina watch as Rin and Asa talk and they decide that they need to know who his true love is.  and when Megumi and Ixkie get onvoled, things get WEIRD.  But it does appear that RIn has made his choice (HERE IS THE SPOILER)....ASA.  The third episode starts off with a memory flashback and the reason behind Rin's dream in episode 3, we also learn how we got the small scar above his left eyebrow and the reason he is living with Kaede.  But as the relationship between Asa and Rin starts blooming, Kaede starts going insane and starts to scare Remu, up to the point that she attacks Asa and puts her the hospital.  The final (and main espisode of this disk) has Rin watching over Asa in the hospital, and Kaede begins to have episodes and this leads to her throwing herself at Rin and forces him to make a decision that will have grave ramifications for all the girls.  and while this is happening, things are not going well with Asa.

now the bad part is the final disk is not until september, which means you have to wonder how this is going to end.  I know I will watch this at least twice before then.  See you when the final disk is here.......",1217635200,,1739,4.281345565749236
8270757,5,B0018RCN1S,"Wow first I have to say Kaide is crazy as hell! You pretty much realize that the nicey nice act is just an act. When she loses it her first thought is not how to fight you, but she cuts out all that and gets to the point being I WANT YOU DEAD. This is actually the most human she has seemed. No one could be that sweet. You don't have to be a pychopath but people have feelings and she surpresed hers to the point where she imploided. The other more realistic aspect of this show is how in general you find out more of the girls true nature. In life when you meet someone you act as nice as posible to get them into you, then over time you turn into the real you. For Rin this has to be a blow. You find out Nerine really isn't a great singer after all, her voice belongs to Lycoris, and oh by the way she met you years ago not me. Primula who you thought was cute little demon girl isn't even human at all but is A.I. Sia turns out to have a split personality. Kaide who was crazy back in the day, you thought was over all that turns into the KKK, being the Knights of Killer Kaide. And Asa who was the most chill of the group keeps passing out because she has problems. WTF! Man if cuz ain't disolutioned by now nothing will have him like that. Shuffle has finaly goten really good in my opinion to me its definatly work cheking out just to see how bad it gets. Peace",1216771200,,1369,3.963768115942029
