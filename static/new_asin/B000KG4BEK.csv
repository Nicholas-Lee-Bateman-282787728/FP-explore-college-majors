2689827,5,B000KG4BEK,"DearS is one of the most classic fan-service anime's out there. Lots of girls in skimpy little outfits running around for your pleasure!

Of course DearS also has a fun story to tell, many hilarious circumstances, and most importantly great music! I've heard a lot of enjoyable music in anime over my years and the opening to DearS is easily among the best.

If you are looking for action and violence, you won't find much if any here.

If you are looking for cute girls, comedy, a little drama, and all-around fun then buy DearS now! At this price the complete box set is a great deal!",1179100800,7,586,4.457943925233645

8156319,5,B000KG4BEK,"Really enjoyable set of dvds, glad I found it.
Funny and good story with interesting characters, Good that it is in English too.",1376784000,,128,4.608695652173913
8156320,5,B000KG4BEK,"I saw this Anime on Youtube. I like it. I went on another web site and got it. It was much cheaper. The story is about teenager boy in High school. On the way home he found alien girl. In the end, it work out for them.",1376092800,,218,3.6595744680851063
8156321,4,B000KG4BEK,"I don't think I will need to talk about or complain about Eng Dubbing, if there even is one in this set. However let me give you all a warning.

To some of you who wish to get your hands on the dvd vol or box set, please look at the sample photos on Amazon. The first photo of the thick box is the Authentic dvd set. The second is a fake.

For future reference, if it does not look like the cover of Rin holding Takeya, its fake. If the side doesn't barely say Pioneer on the bind, its fake. If there's any words like ""Perfect Collection"", its 100% fake.

Just thought I'd warn you guys. Good day.

As for the show it's a pity that it ended a bit early. It has its own pace so its kinda a love or hate thing but there's nothing too special about it. There's no growth in love or relationship but whether a guy will just finally accept a weird person in the house. For a short old series this can still be nostalgic and pleasing to the audience. That's all I'll say, I just hope there's no Eng Dub, no offense to Eng Dub lovers. Even Kung Fu Panda has better acting.",1329782400,4,1065,4.009433962264151
8156322,4,B000KG4BEK,the only problem with this series is that it is way too short. One didn't want it to end as quickly as it did.  The Dears were a race of alien slave women on their home planets. The people of Earth thinks they were only servants as they crash on earth unable to return and become citizens of Japan. When Rei a reject Dear's suspended animation capsule breaks off the ship and wash ashore she is the first Dear to truly find a master even if the other Dears want her captured or destory to keep their secrets from accidently leaking out. The series is full of adult human like a teacher who comes on to her students in her under wear and makes the kids read pron in school.  Other than the few adult spots its over all a wonderful series.,1254441600,,737,4.183098591549296
8156323,2,B000KG4BEK,"DearS - 5/10

DearS is a combination of a failed Chobits clone (lacking any of the warmth that made that series so endearing) and, depending on your gender, offensive pro-slave rubbish. It's also uneventful, lacking a story and instead containing the same perverted nonsense you've seen before already until the episode count reaches 12-13.

To start with, the premise is beyond dumb. A UFO crashes into Japan, 150 aliens - who happen to be submissive hotties - emerge, and they're welcomed by the world. Because humans are, as we all know, kind and understanding creatures by nature, no attempts were made to capture and experiment on the aliens. It's the sort of plot element that would only work in a hentai. Or Melody of Oblivion.

...oh yes, hentai material. Have I covered the part where DearS all wear dog collars and are happy to be slaves, doing whatever their master wants, including sex? It's like sitting through the wet dream of a pre-pubescent retard. I'm sure most female viewers would find it slightly offensive to see females wearing dog collars and being happy to get in the kitchen when told - a great fan pleasing idea.

As for the characters, Ren (the Chi of DearS) is blank, having zero personality. She also looks bad because of the crappy art - not at all fap worthy. And Takeya, the lucky lead, is a complete arsehole, never being a man and always being a complete **** to Ren. He even tells her to go home and cook his food, also ordering her to clean his room. He lacks any likeability. The only character with any depth whatsoever in this mess is the pink-haired DearS, whose name I've already forgot.

On the plus side, DearS is easy to watch. It's so simple and stupid that it's possible to watch it for four hours, miss lines of dialogue and still understand what's going on. If you happen to be braindead or looking for something that's easy to watch, despite being dull, DearS is for you. I only managed to sit through it all because I wasn't required to use my brain and could just chill.

Alongside Melody of Oblivion, DearS has made for a great start to going through my DVD backlog. I can't wait to have a look at Petite Princess Yucie and A Little Snow Fairy Sugar. By the end of watching all the wonderful series I've collected on DVD, my mental state might reach the stage where life will seem too painful.

Overall, I suggest avoiding DearS unless A) your dream woman wears a dog collar and stays in the kitchen or B) you're an idiot who paid money for the series because it's an OOP Geneon title. Stick to Chobits and avoid this poor attempt at copying it.",1245283200,4,2598,4.538461538461538
8156324,4,B000KG4BEK,this anime is something you should watch with your openminded girl friend. not porn but not for kids ither lol. the fan service is enuff to keep you captivated lol. if you like cute pervy anime this is for you.,1242604800,,210,4.275
8156325,5,B000KG4BEK,"The anime is the story of Takeya, an average high school student in the fictitious Koharu precfecture, and how his life is turned on its head, due to the appearance of a beautiful and apparently defective DearS he calls ""Ren"" Her full name is, Ren-Ren-Ren-Nagusaran-Rensia-Roroonren-Nakora. Weird, huh : ) The Ren-Ren-Ren means she is defective (sounds kinda like Chobits huh? But the familiarity is endearing and not rip-offish) It's a funny and cute UFO-girl-meets-boy story with excellent art by Bandai Visual. Great addition to any bi-shojo (cute girl) anime collection.",1238889600,,574,5.388888888888889
8156326,3,B000KG4BEK,"I'd give it a 3.5 stars. I think everyone that gave this anime a 5 stars are mainly anime pervs, seriously, just admit it. However, it is a decent anime to watch but it is very predictable, plots, characters, everything.

Don't agree? Get this:

1. Innocent or dorky or shy looking guy that is a closet perv but has great qualities hidden inside that the girls eventually find attracted to.
2. A bunch of cute girls gathering around this guy, the main one being the the ditzy type that doesn't but falls in love with main character guy, but tries to get his attention especially when the other girls try to get the main character guy.
3. Lots of pervy situations

Completely fantasized and rubbish in a way. Watch Ahh! My Goddess, Chobits, Princess Valkyrie, Girls Bravo, Love Hina, Mahou Sensei, Please Teacher just to name a few and you'll see they all fit into that catagory.

The catagory being a guy that, even if he lives a million life times, would never really get that luck.......get that lucky! And a lot of them end up not appreciating it that much or they're too weak to do anything about their incredibly lucky situation, which pisses you off just watching.

So, average at best but still fun to watch. Just don't expect originality AT ALL. I mean, they got a slightly different storyline but other than that, nothing. Just plain pathetic overused plots and ideas.",1235865600,2,1377,4.627049180327869
8156327,4,B000KG4BEK,"I was kickin back about a few days ago and wanted to watch something funny that has a pretty easy story to understand. Well I went out and found this. DearS can be discribed as a clone of Chobits. So I'm pretty sure Chobits fans will like this series. Ren is a DearS, DearS are nothing more than assets to a human. Well I really don't want to spoil everthing so I'll leave it as this. If your looking for laughs and some pretty easy story telling DearS delivers!
