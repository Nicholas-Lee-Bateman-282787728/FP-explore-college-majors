8758749,3,B01EHI4MOK,The anime was pretty good. It was mostly action which is how the One Year War should be! Definitely worth the watch but I don't think it's worth paying $75 for a 70minute movie. I somewhat regret buying it but not really. It's a win lose situation.,1491523200,3,248,4.297872340425532

8758754,4,B01EHI4MOK,"First thing's first: Yes, this does include the English dub. All of the Gundam OVA/ONA series are being released with the English dub on the Japanese Blu-rays. Unfortunately, this means that the only way to own these series is to pay a pretty high price for them (unless they get some form of American release). The product being sold here is the standard edition of the movie, but there is a collector's edition out there. The collector's edition contains the story boards for all four episodes, an additional art book, and a bonus disc which I believe talks about the making of the show. The bonus disc is only in Japanese though, and doesn't have English subtitles. Now that all of this is cleared out of the way, let's talk about the show.

Let's begin by talking about the show's strengths. I would say the two biggest things that this show has going for it are the animation and the soundtrack. This show looks great, much like all of the other Gundam series lately. The action sequences are very well done too. Unlike Gundam: The Origin, very little CG is used when the mobile suits. I didn't mind it in The Origin, but I prefer the way it was done here. In addition to these great action sequences, there is a great jazz soundtrack to accompany them. I like the contrast of the smooth jazz and the epic space battles.
The story here is another strong point of the show. It shows what else is going on during the events of the original Gundam series. Thunderbolt takes place in Side Four, a space colony that was destroyed during the battles between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon. Despite what happened to Side Four, the two sides continue fighting. Two ace pilots end up standing out in these battles. The first is Io Fleming of the Earth Federation and the second is Daryl Lorenz of the Principality of Zeon. Fleming has a good reason to despise Zeon since they are responsible for destroying his home, and Lorenz has reason to hate the Earth Federation after he lost his legs in a battle against them. I don't want to give away too much here and spoil anything, but I will say that this series, more than any other one in the Gundam franchise, makes it difficult to see which side is right. There are good and bad people on both sides, and I still couldn't choose which side to empathize with after I had finished watching it.

While I might have just praised the story, I did have some problems with it. There were some things that I felt should have had more screen time. There was some sort of internal conflict among the crew of the Earth Federation, but there was no real build up to it. Some people simply didn't like the way that the captain came into power. There weren't really any moments that showed the captain being incompetent, but there were a few that showed how stressed out she was. It felt like a weak subplot and I think that the story would have been fine if it was taken out.

Now the major drawback to this release is the price. Since anime is ridiculously expensive in Japan (compared to the United States), this 70 minute long series will cost you an arm and a leg (no pun intended). I put off buying this release because of that, and honestly I probably wouldn't own it if I hadn't picked it up at an anime convention on an impulse. I snagged the collector's edition because it has become pretty difficult to find. If you're unsure of if you want to own this set, I would say to look around and try to see if you can find a price you're comfortable paying. If you can't, then hopefully it will get some sort of US release.

To sum things up for those of you who don't want to read this whole thing, this is a great series. If you are willing to spend the money, I would recommend picking it up.",1471392000,18,3750,4.406926406926407
