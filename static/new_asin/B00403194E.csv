8411718,5,B00403194E,"Seikichi is a young fireworks maker living in Edo in the mid 1800's. The problem is that the newly appointed magistrate has banned any kind of luxury, including fireworks. Seikishi secretly makes and tests his fireworks with the help of his neighbors, and waits for the day when he will be able to awe people without fear of incarceration. One day a cute girl named Sora comes to Seikichi with a strange request. She wants him to build a rocket that will get her to the Moon. He is enchanted with her mysterious personality and beauty, so he decides to take the job. Sora is definitely odd, but the question is, how odd exactly? She seems to have a connection to a monster that has been draining the blood of the local citizens. What is her secret, and what will Seikichi do when he learns what it is.

This anime is really good. It has tons of comedy, hilarious action, and a bit of drama. The character designs are pretty good. The main characters is a carbon copy of Otaru from Saber Marionette J. I think that's part of the comedic aspect. This series is completely ridiculous. It doesn't have a serious aspect to it at all. The language is a little bit strong, so I would rate it PG-13. There isn't any brutal violence or fan service. The charms of this series are the characters and dialogue. There are lots of great characters with colorful personalities, and plenty of hilarious dialogue.  The voice cast, animation, and soundtrack are great too.  I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this anime. I can't believe that I didn't catch it sooner. I strongly recommend it to anyone that needs a good laugh and wants to have fun.",1358208000,,1644,4.491638795986622
8411719,4,B00403194E,"It is sometime in the mid-1800's in Edo (modern day Tokyo) and the young fireworks maker Seikichi Tamaya is having hard time due to harsh frugality laws, which ban all luxuries, including fireworks. The law doesn't stop Seikichi from doing what he loves best, but it does make for difficult working conditions. But one day Seikichi comes home to find a strange girl with an even stranger request: she wants Seikichi to build a firework that will reach the moon!

When I first saw advertisements for this show, I thought it looked kind of fun, but I wasn't really interested in it. But when I read a review for it on ANN that praised it and its excellent dub, I thought I'd give it a shot (I prefer to watch anime in Japanese, but I always appreciate a good dub). I watched the first episode online to check it out and it was suitably funny, so I picked up the set to watch with my sisters. We all enjoyed it greatly. The characters are awesomely wacky, the setting excellent, and the plot moves along at a good pace. The dub really is excellent, and I don't think that the series would have been quite as good in Japanese. We did watch a little of it in Japanese to compare, and while the voice acting for the Japanese dub was quite good, the humor was lacking. The English dub adds quite a few jokes and adapts the humor to a more western style. I think that they managed to make it much more enjoyable to western viewers while still preserving the spirit of the original.

If you enjoy wacky humor (for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kodocha-The-First-Season/dp/B003NE8B56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kodocha: The First Season</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Frog-Season-One/dp/B0049TC8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Frog: Season One</a>) then you should be sure to give Oh! Edo Rocket a try. It is a solid, humorous, and entertaining show. (Oh, and did I mention there are aliens?)",1298332800,3,1985,5.1806853582554515
8411720,4,B00403194E,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi

Situations: Probably PG+  Types of humor may not be suitable for children
Language:  Probably PG
Nudity:  PG  Maybe not even that much
Violence:  PG  May increase to PG+ because of second part of season one.

Language options: Dub, Sub with separate on/off option. The way it should be.

Special Features: Clean open/close. Trailers(Previews) - These are at least dubbed and make some effort at giving an idea of what the series is about. Some are for live action though, not really appropriate on an anime disc IMO.

First, contains anachronisms - on purpose. It also uses various animation styles for different characters with the ""less important"" being almost comic-strip like simple drawings, the main male character (Tamaya) being in a more ""card-game"" anime style and others being more realistic styles. Oddly this works well for this series and is unique.
It starts out as the stock ridiculous comedy, but with oddly serious scenes thrown in. Don't worry they develop smoothly into a brilliant plot line that has a blend of thought-provoking, historical and entertainment elements all while remaining a comedy-romance. Even when around episode 20 it seems the main story is over and the rest will only be filler episodes, it turns around and pulls it out with a tie-up of lose ends. It does have the requisite ridiculous comedy ending, but not as the only end with no real conclusion. Overall one of the best written animes I've seen.
The situations rating I gave it is due to jokes or inferences about things like necrophilia, homosexuality, and other ""mature"" themes. Most could probably be brushed aside as they are usually brief and implied rather than obvious.",1294099200,2,1764,5.048275862068966
8411721,5,B00403194E,"I love this series!!! Funny, beautifully animated, and interesting.  I watched this series in English, and the voice acting is well done, there is a lot of adult-themed humor in this series, one minute it is serious, the next it's funny, and then it can go weird, yes, very weird!!! The music in this series is rather interesting, it's different than what I am used to hearing in an anime.  This series is a ton of fun, and will leave you laughing and smiling.  Well done.",1291593600,,472,4.465116279069767
8411722,5,B00403194E,"The art is perfect and vibrant.  The story is interesting.  Characters are funny.  Japanese vocals are excellent.  English vocals a good too.  Probably not like any other anime you ever saw.  Some of the language maybe not appropriate for very young children but it's really a cute show.  I don't just give any decent anime 5 stars.  I'm giving this one 5 stars because I think it's just fabulous.  I don't want to spoil the show so all I'll say is it involves a lot of humor, aliens, and fireworks.  If you can get into an anime that isn't super serious you'll probably get into this one.",1291593600,2,589,4.420560747663552
