8468429,4,B005ELEMOK,Some original and captivating bite scenes in this title. Good acting and picture. The box cover may be a little misleading for I don't recall such a scene. Still it's worth a look at the low rental cost.,1365897600,,203,4.368421052631579
8468430,4,B005ELEMOK,"As far as reproduction and packaging go, I would rate this five-stars. Audio/video reproduction is good and clean, especially for an obscure, low-budget flick from the '80s. Some nice extra features, including an interview with Gustav Vintas, a commentary track with star Jason Williams, and the ability to add/subtract Maria's introduction (I find these things tedious after the first viewing).

The movie itself rates a solid 3 stars. Although the premise is intriguing -- is the villain an actual vampire masquerading as a hypnotherapist, or is he the reverse? -- the potential is unfulfilled. And certain elements (the dance sequence, and the Renfield-equivalent's mullet, to name two) -- really date it. But it's still an intriguing story; with more money and talent, ""Vampire at Midnight"" might have been a classic.",1359936000,2,821,5.315384615384615
