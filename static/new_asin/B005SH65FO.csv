4883909,5,B005SH65FO,"A series to watch over and over -- especially when I need a lift. The shenanigans of these misguided idlers contrasting with the grandeur and beauty of the Yorkshire landscape and the shabby dignity of a former mill town refresh my soul. Their antics are like those of a gang of 14-year-old boys -- no money, no transportation and too much time on their hands. Risible mischief abounds. One complaint: The DVD's are released in no particular order and are released way too slowly.",1327276800,5,480,4.726190476190476
4883910,5,B005SH65FO,"If you like the dry wit of British humor, you will fall in love with this series.  There is a reason it is the longest running British SITCOM!!! It is genius.",1324252800,3,158,4.096774193548387
4883911,5,B005SH65FO,"I fell in love with this series a long time ago. Then it was cancelled, and I was broken hearted. Now I have about 7 dvd's that I love. They start out pretty serious, but then when you least expect it, something funny happens, or someone says something funny, and it gets hilarous. I wish there were more dvd's. Sometimes they're a little hard to understand, but the more I watch, the easier it gets.  I would recommend this series.",1323302400,14,432,4.4

4883942,5,B005SH65FO,"I love this show and would love it more if it wasn't for the annoyingly LOUD laugh track Yes, I know they famously didn't use a ""laugh-track"" per se; no, they recorded an audience watching the taped parts and used that - L O U D L Y !!! In some of the episodes the recorded laughter steps on the dialogue. I don't understand the why the execs or whomever thinks it is necessary to cue the audience to laughter. I have bought and watched almost the whole 38 year spanning series and have gotten to the point where I watch it now with my thumb on the Mute button on the remote. There is such a predictable pattern of canned laughs that I can usually time the ""mutes"" perfectly. What a pain. It is for this reason that I can't watch anymore of these. At least for awhile.
Otherwise, a very enjoyable easy-going show.",1432598400,,813,4.251612903225807

You might have to get into it and know the characters, but these old guys, along with the neighborhood in this small quaint village are refreshingly funny!  It is, I believe, the longest running series, up there with Are You Being Served, another of our favorites!  You won't stop with this one if you start it.",1389052800,,474,4.292134831460674

4883989,5,B005SH65FO,"The longest running comedy show on the planet.  Leave it to the Brits to come up with well written scripts that are extremely funny without being insipid or inane.  It's much like the Little Rascals at the other end of life, after they've all retired.  I can't imagine why the entire series is not already available on DVD.",1370390400,3,323,4.5344827586206895

4884021,5,B005SH65FO,"These Brit-Coms are an acquired taste. Years ago, when I first saw them on PBS, I didn't care much about them. They are a drier, more subtle, humor than I was accustomed to. Over time, they grew on me, and I now can't get enough of them. I now buy as many episodes as I can find. This disc has some of the best. They take pace in a small English village full of mostly old-farts going through a second childhood. Picture Benny Hill, without the sex, and you get some idea of what they are like.",1367539200,,494,4.103092783505154

4884030,5,B005SH65FO,"May be I am a little home sick for England, but I find this show to be refreshing and funny.  The main characters remind me of 3 school boys on holiday and looking for things to do. The situations are both silly and believable.  The scenery is so typical of that part of England and the writing and acting are up to the usual high standard I have come to expect from these productions.  This is the fourth set of Last of the Summer wine discs that I own, they all get watched over and over again. Half an hour to laugh before bed is a great tonic.",1357171200,,547,4.046296296296297

4884063,5,B005SH65FO,"My only regret is that I didn't find this show sooner. I have every DVD released for Region 1 & 2. A little over the top, but this show has that affect on viewers. Watch it once and you will be hooked. The actors are so talented and believable. Roy Clarke has created a state of mind where anyone can ""go"" and just kick back for a while.

4884068,5,B005SH65FO,I just love the simple humor of this show.  I started watching this show on Public TV but I decided i wanted to be able to watch anytime.  This show just grows on you and it just simply tricks my funny bone.  I can watch these programs over and over again.  It helps bring a smile to my face.,1332288000,,292,3.8983050847457625
4884069,3,B005SH65FO,"First off I am very saddened to rate this set a three star.  I own all the sets that come trickling along at an unusually slow pace.  However, because I love this series I have put up with a lot of sins by the outfit that churns out these sets.  Now finally I've had it!  There is NO insert listing the episodes on this DVD.  In the past I've had to print out one of the reviews that thankfully lists the episodes.  Is it too much to ask the company to include an insert with the episodes listed, date of airing etc?  It's not as if these are cheap budget DVDs.  I think it is time we the consumers hold the company to account on this matter.

Secondly, the episodes with Smiler are a total bomb.  In these episodes Compo plays the depressed party and the chemistry of the show is laid asunder.  It just does not work.  To make matters worse Smiler comes across as not a likable character.  Unlike Howard, who grows on you, with his sneaky antics, Smiler just gets more annoying as the show progresses.  There are a couple of episodes on this DVD that downplay Compo's envy and Smiler's role and those are hilarious.

All said and done this set is still worth watching but it certainly hits a low water mark of the series.  I still love LOTSW and hope that the upcoming sets will be packaged with episode listings and details and hopefully future releases will have less of Smiler and more of the three lovable loafers.",1330560000,15,1419,4.318181818181818
4884070,5,B005SH65FO,"Once again, the Christmas Special will be included!

From the press release: ""Ah, what a year! Once again, the vintage threesome are up to their old tricks. Compo is as smitten as ever with Nora, but Foggy is back working on his crackpot inventions-and poor Clegg is dragged into their mischief-making plots even though he knows better.""

There are 7 episodes this time out:

Quick, Quick, Slow - Nora has taken Smiler in as her lodger, and Compo is depressed about it.
Give Us a Lift - Compo is convinced the hills are getting steeper, so Foggy invents a chair lift.
Was That Nora Batty Singing - Compo believes he can hear Nora singing, and is convinced that she and Smiler are having an affair.
Cash Flow Problems - Compo is skint, but remembers that he's owed money from an old schoolfriend, so the trio set off to track him down.
Passing the Earring - Howard asks Clegg if he can return an earring to Marina.
Pole Star - Compo is depressed because he's too short to help Nora hang her washing line, but Foggy suggests that she'd be impressed if he could vault up onto the wall.
Situation Vacant - The Christmas Special

As I've said before on my reviews of the LOTSW sets, don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to LOTSW on first viewing. This show grows on you over time. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... it was slow and seemed almost without a plot. But after watching a few more episodes I was hooked!

In a prior reveiw I stated: ""Come on Warner Brothers, how about a more realistic release pace of 4-5 series a year..."" - Well it apears they listened to those of us with that simple plea.

Bonus news:  Based on a blog post at bbcamericashop the series is now on a ""quarterly release plan""!  Vintage 1992 is up for advance order there with a April 17, 2012 date.
