8444316,3,B004W3W9E6,"This is a made for TV movie done in the era of ""Love Canal."" The film stars Lynda Carter who is a country and western singer. She tortures her child Abbey (Louanne) by making her wear a bad Dutch Boy haircut. Her husband Mike (Dale Robinette) is a private investigator who gets caught investigating the evil chemical company hiding a secret about the waste under the town of Landry, Texas.

When Mike drops out of the picture, Lynda Carter goes Erin Brockovich all over them!

The film quality is not good. I watched the film because it had Lyda Carter bound on the kitchen floor and a certain amount of era camp value from haircuts to cassette tapes. Lynda appears to lip syncs her songs, although she can actually sing. The corporation is clumsy and cliche in its operation, as is the film which made me shake my head at the stuff I used to watch and like. What really caught me off guard was that the mommy and daddy in this film were not divorced, separated, or had outside love interests. A real throw back. In one scene Ronny Cox coerces Lynda Carter to remove her sun glasses so he can see her eyes. Not exactly the way I would have written the scene. I had to laugh.

Most people today will not enjoy this dated film which has not stood the test of time. BTW this cover photo doesn't appear in the film.",1363910400,,1311,4.3428571428571425
