I love it because it is narrated by Alec Baldwin (who I prefer) and it has Salty, Cranky, and all the other fun ""sidekicks"" as well as the main trains.

8048388,4,B0007LPSTA,"""Ahoy mateys! Salty, pride of the seven seas. I'm a new Diesel and I'm here to give you some help.""  Salty. Salty's Secret (later rereleased as ""Harvey to the Rescue"") is the first Thomas and Friends Series Six DVD from 2002. It contains the first six stories of the six season.

#1-Salty's Secret: Salty, a new diesel engine arrives on Sodor, but is dismayed when he is sent to work at the quarry with Bill, Ben and Mavis. However, he has his own secret when handling with those Troublesome Trucks.

#2: Harvey to the Rescue: The engines tease a new engine named Harvey, a crane engine, because they think he looks different. But after Percy has an accident with some pesky trucks, Harvey shows that being different can come in handy.

#3: No Sleep for Cranky: Cranky the Crane gets stuck with Salty, Bill and Ben after he accidently knocks over a shed, blocking the tracks when he  gets tired of listening to Salty's stories.

#4: The Fogman: Cyril the Fogman always warns engines of fog in winter by placing detonators on the rails. But when he's replaced by a new mechanical foghorn, Thomas ends up in a crash.

#5: A Bad Day for Harold the Helicopter: When Harold boast that he can take the mail much faster than Percy, he has a chance to prove himself when Percy gets stuck at a broken signal, until the mail bags make him crash.

#6: Elizabeth the Vintage Lorry: When one of Thomas' side rods breaks while taking a goods train, his crew find an old steam lorry named Elizabeth.

Each of these stories teach important lessons of being different, having manners, and not boasting about being the best. Overall, a great Thomas video to pick up for your kids. Highly recommended!",1439769600,,1682,4.58
8048389,3,B0007LPSTA,"The DVD selection of stories was fine and my grandson enjoyed the stories, which I would have rated 5 stars.  However, the picture shows what looks to be Bertie the red bus as the ""toy"" included, which is one that my grandson had been asking for.  Instead the package contained another blue Thomas the tank engine, of which we already have several.  Perhaps Amazon should scan the current package to show the correct toy. Others that I have ordered from Amazon have contained toy trains that match the picture.",1207872000,3,510,4.707865168539326
8048390,4,B0007LPSTA,"Ok so all in all i liked this video...it combined some classic characters such as Thomas and Percy as well as new characters like Salty and Harvey.

Salty's Secret: 4/5

Very good introduction to Salty as well as a good welcome back to bill and ben. Salty comes to the island and is sent to work in the quarry with bill, ben, and mavis, even though he likes the sea. The reason this did not get a 5  is because the scenery is a bit dull and the ""secret"" advertised with the trucks was simply that Salty sings, however, the songs are very catchy and upbeat.

Harvey to the rescue: 4/5

Good way to teach children respect for others even if they look different. Harvey is a crane engine who the engines at first dislike because he looks different but then after he helped Percy when percy had an accident he proved himself to be useful and the engines soon befriended him. I had to take points off for the horrible scenery. In this story it shows even more. But only very educated children would be able to notice

No sleep for Cranky: 2.5/5

Im very happy to see Cranky but I was hoping he would be shown as less Cranky and not lonely and bitter. Cranky drops pipes on the tracks so they knock over a shed leaving Cranky trapped for the night with Bill, Ben, and Salty. Not very special at all. Though this story does get 2 points because it has comedy and for once a new character is introduced with proper development of character.

The Fogman: 4/5

A big improvement after the last story! A new fog machine comes to the island to replace a fogman but when the machine causes an accident for Thomas the fogman comes to the rescue and warns toby who is on the same line of the danger ahead. The Scenery for Misty Valley is alot better than the countryside seen in the last few stories. It only gets a 4 because I wish it was done with engines not seen this video like James, Henry, or Gordon.

A Bad Day For Harold: 3/5

The scenery has improved but this story does not have much towards the way of plot. Percy enjoys taking the mail so when a broken signal forces him to give his mail to harold he is upset. Harold later breaks down because it is too heavy for him and Percy saves him. It is nice to see a story about Harold the helicopter like in ""make someone happy"" but I do prefer the stories with engines.

Elizabith the Vintage Quarry Truck: 2/5

I was being generous with this one. It is by far the worst story on the video. It introduces Elizabith, who is a stuck up snotty truck that helped Thomas when he broke down carrying a special. The plot itself was a 3.5 but then it lost points for lines like ""Thomas likes pulling specials, they make him feel special"" and also for the poor ironic twist at the end where Elizabith turns out to be TFC's first car so he repaints her.

James the splendid red engine (song):5/5

This is an excellent song. It is catchy, witty, and shows an engine other than Thomas and Percy (like the better half of the video). Warning though this song is very easy to get stuck into your head!

Basicly this is a good buy for children who prefer chracters like bill, ben, mavis, and cranky. In General it is good too. I highly recomend it",1176076800,4,3173,4.27212020033389
