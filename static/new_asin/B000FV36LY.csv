8127036,3,B000FV36LY,I think the rest of the reviews put how the movie was well enough that I'm not gonna write a new review saying all the same things. This movie was fine. But something that I think is noteworthy is the fact that Charlie just happens to be gay in this plot - presumably because Justin Lo is gay? - it's not at all about him being gay. It's about how he's been dealt the short end of the stick and falls in love and it happens to be same-sex love.,1381708800,,444,3.9444444444444446
8127037,3,B000FV36LY,"THE CONRAD BOYS is the directorial debut of Justin Lo (also serving as producer, screenwriter, and star). A drama revolving around Charlie Conrad (Lo), a gay 19-year-old coping with grief after the sudden death of his mother. He must also care for his younger brother Ben (Boo Boo Stewart), as Ben's sole guardian after their alcoholic father Doug (Barry Shay) abandoned the family several years before. When Doug reappears in town, sober and hoping to reestablish a relationship with his sons, Charlie struggles with forgiveness and letting go of lingering resentment toward his father.

Meanwhile, Charlie crosses paths with Jordan Rivers (Nick Bartzen), a  young drifter and writer with a mysterious past. As Charlie and Jordan grow closer, they establish a romantic relationship. The strength of this new bond leaves Charlie torn; devote himself to the free-spirited new man in his life, or remain loyal to Ben and his already established world? When darker aspects of Jordan's history catch up with him, putting the Conrad family in danger, Charlie is left in an even deeper dilemma...

This film, although flawed in many ways, is not a complete failure. Nick Bartzen's performance is THE CONRAD BOYS' greatest strength. Bartzen brings plenty of sex appeal and persuasiveness to the character of Jordan, his general likability working as a counterpoint to Justin Lo's Charlie. Lo's acting is the movie's chief weakness. Whining and cynicism are the primary range of Lo's charisma. While I understand that Charlie is a wounded character, with the memory of his father's past abuse and the trauma of his mother's passing to deal with, a pall of pessimism over his outlook should be expected, but this side of Charlie dominates our view of him from the very opening scene (prior to the mother's death). I felt more could have been done to make Charlie a more endearing guy on the script level. Considering the fact that Lo held the creative keys to THE CONRAD BOYS, it makes me believe he simply wrote himself into the story, making Charlie a character it wouldn't stretch him to inhabit.

Speaking of the script, the film also would have benefited from a more experienced writer. Much of the dialogue feels forced, made worse when combined with the acting of Lo and some of the minor players. The film's climax requires some suspension of disbelief. The music meshes with the film, but is not super memorable. The film's title simply appears onscreen with no fanfare, the first signpost of Lo's uninventive, merely fuctional direction.

I don't want people to think I dislike this movie. It's watchable (even mildly enjoyable) thanks entirely to Bartzen's performance. It has enough going for it to fill its 90-minute length, but little more. But in the hands of someone with more experience, THE CONRAD BOYS may have matured into something more than adolescent.",1357344000,2,2865,5.0358649789029535
8127038,3,B000FV36LY,"Story - a single mother raises two boys, after being left by her husband. One day she dies and the older son (who was supposed to go to college) takes care of his little bro.
But, since he is a gay, we are introduced to a hunky stranger Jordan who shortly after wins the heart of our hero.
It could have been a perfect love story, but both the past chases Jordan and the little brother gets confused seeing his older sibling in bed with another boy.
Add a father coming back after many years and problems starts to appear one after another.

""The Conrad..."" is a film where the leading part, the script and direction are done by one person. And, sorry to write this,but it effects the final result. I think that casting another person to play Charlie would have been wiser choice. Justin Lo should stick to writing and maybe directing, but should keep off acting.
Among so many bad gay theme movies, this one regards a little bit of attention.",1311638400,,943,4.419540229885057
8127039,4,B000FV36LY,"I decided to see this movie because of the plot and because of his actor, writter, producer and editor (Justin Lo). I saw this movie, like many other gay movies, hoppeing I'll see more of the same (gay stories, bad actors, muscles, sex...) My surprise was I found a very simple, low cost film... With no much money, Mister Lo makes a nice reflection about the lost, first love, family and dreams. Mister Lo show us a honest and intimist story whith no pretentions and I'll wait with no doubt his next films... Sorry for my English.
Sin duda, una gran experiencia, una historia sencilla sin falsas morales que te hace disfrutar, reir y llorar con una pelcula que habr costado el 10% de cualquier produccin estadounidense. Buen trabajo Justin Lo.",1230854400,2,744,4.687022900763359
8127040,5,B000FV36LY,"Directed, starred in, AND written by...Justin Lo, this film follows a the life of Charlie Conrad who finds himself putting his life on hold once he has to care for his younger brother after the sudden death of his mother.  The screen comes to life once Nick Bartzen, who plays the drifter Jordan Rivers.  While this young love story unfolds, Charlie's estranged father comes back into the Conrad boys life...

It is a heartwarming tale.",1164585600,8,436,4.786666666666667
8127041,5,B000FV36LY,"As many have said, the first time I saw this slice of ""unusual"" life film, Nick Bartzen did an amazing job, but it is the performance by Justin that makes this film a must see. I just saw it again tonight, and was blown away again by Justin. Will always be a Justin fan for this one film alone.",1163721600,7,294,4.0
8127042,4,B000FV36LY,"If, like me, you can enjoy a small, intimate and thoughtful film, The Conrad Boys definitely has something to offer.

This is truly a family film, though certainly not in the way that overused term usually implies.

Charlie is a likable but somewhat rigid and introverted young man who faces some major life changes over the course of the story. Even though his own future becomes uncertain, he's determined to single-handedly raise his little brother as well.

The DVD includes a lively Director's Commentary which points out some things you may not notice in a first viewing, and also contains some indications of the care that went into the script and musical choices.

Even though there are a few scenes that could perhaps have been more polished, that seemed to stem mostly from the constraints of a low budget, a chronic complication for most indie makers that is alluded to in the Director's Commentary. I found any such flaws easy to overlook in light of the film's other merits.

It's noteworthy that the same person wrote, co-produced, directed, edited AND starred in this movie. As with many small films, this may have been due, in at least some part, to necessity. And while that was an ambitious -- and perhaps even risky -- choice, particularly for a young director's first film, it does result in a highly personal work. We shouldn't forget that some real gems have been made over the years by directors who are able to maintain that degree of creative control over their movies.

Overall, The Conrad Boys represents quite an accomplishment for a first-time director, including his sensitive portrayal of Charlie. I look forward to his future projects.",1163721600,11,1667,4.8936170212765955
8127043,1,B000FV36LY,"I can't begin to decide what I liked least about this film: the script or the acting. Justin Lo (star, writer, director) does not convince in the lead role of Charlie. His acting is remarkably bad. The script he wrote has barely plausible plot elements and is generally weak story telling. The one star I have given this film is based solely on the fact that Mr. Lo at the age of 24, wrote, directed, edited, produced and acted in his own first film. That in itself is a feat to be reckoned with.",1163030400,5,496,4.287234042553192
8127044,4,B000FV36LY,"So Conrad Boys is a pretty decent film.  the basic story is good, (19yo raises his 6yo brother when their mom dies & long-lost-alcoholic-abusive-then-turned-a-new-leaf dad comes back to make ammends) but it could have been worked a bit differently.  a bit of humor could have been thrown in to break up the sometimes monotonous dialogue.  and something (i'm not sure what though) might have been done to spice up the rhythm of the film...it had it's doldrum moments.  all in all, the acting was very good.  the only weak link in this department is Charlie - who unfortunately is also the main character.  everything he said seemed to come out with too much force; like he's accusing or yelling.  but this is easily overlooked.  i would definitely recommend this for those who like indy films.",1157328000,5,792,4.814814814814815
8127045,3,B000FV36LY,"CONRAD BOYS is not a bad movie: the story though frequently used by others holds its own, the style of direction keeps the pace moving, the message of the movie is worth stating.  The problem is one of a single person assuming the role of writer, director, film editor AND principal actor.  Justin Lo does well in all categories except the last one.  As pleasant as he is to look at his ability to create a believable character on film is seriously lacking.

Charlie (Lo) is a 19-year old taking care of his little brother Ben (Boo Boo Stewart) after the sudden death of their mother.  Charlie is a history buff headed for Columbia for college until his mother's death halts that direction.  He becomes a recluse despite his friend Tori (Nancy Hancock) attempts to get him out of his cafe job and into a social life.  But at last Charlie reluctantly attends a party and eventually encounters a very handsome, intelligent drifter Jordan (Nick Bartzen) who touches Charlie's buried attraction and the two become friends and more.  Jordan has demons, some of which become painfully apparent form his life of crime's encounters from the past.  Another stumbling block for Charlie's adjustment appears in the form of his long departed recovering alcoholic father Doug (Barry Shay) who has cleaned up his act and wants to be a part of Ben's and Charlie's lives.  The myriad clashes to Charlie's fragile ego serve only to bring out his protective forces in caring for Ben and eventually his nascent longing for Jordan and his responsibility for Ben are settled in surprising ways.

The cast Lo has selected is fine - especially the promising young Nick Bartzen and the solid Barry Shay.  If only Lo had had the foresight to cast Charlie with an equally fine actor the film would have played more strongly.  But as a first film by a young talent there is reason to view this venture.  Justin Lo gives evidence of being a solid talent who just needs some focus.  Grady Harp, August 06",1156377600,10,1975,4.700581395348837
