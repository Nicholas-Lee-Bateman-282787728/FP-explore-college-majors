6161586,4,B00HFC30A8,"4 stars for the series.  2 stars for the pricing.  I know the economics of anime have made 700 and 800
minute series extinct but come on.  Both parts 1 & 2 add up to just 550 minutes.  Hopefully after it's
official release other sellers will force Amazon to lower their price.  I already have watched the Japanese
version for free on streaming video.  I recommend this series if you are looking for a fresh take on
the futuristic crime fighting genre but not for $60 for the whole season.  Funimation should of released the
whole season in one set and cut the price.",1392854400,8,566,4.384615384615385
6161587,5,B00HFC30A8,"Over shadowed by series like Sword Art Online & Attack on Titan, Psycho-Pass released under the radar to many (myself included), however this series is not one you'll want to miss. Set in a future where law & order is maintained by a surveillance system that monitors everyone's actions and intents, this standout anime is set up rather uniquely and executed near flawlessly. Easily one of, if not my, favorite anime series of the past couple years. To top it off a second season has already been announced in the works.",1391040000,71,520,4.725274725274725

6161596,5,B00HFC30A8,"A psychological thriller that gets compared to Death Note quite a bit. The premises are very different, but I must say that the nail-biting thrill of the latter series is evident in most episodes. There's a fair amount of violence in this series for which it appropriately wears a TV-MA rating, but nothing really disgusting or disturbing. This is a crime case/psychological thriller and that is the focus of the series.",1466899200,,420,4.929577464788732

6161602,5,B00HFC30A8,"Psycho-Pass, Deadman Wonderland, and Baccano are always the 3 anime that I recommend to everyone! Psycho-Pass is particularly interesting because of the way it portrays society's view of mental health and crime. Someone that is dangerous should be taken into custody before they commit terrible things; makes sense right? It is something that all of us think about at one time or another. With Psycho-Pass you get to explore these ideas in ways that only an anime can do!",1458432000,,471,4.974683544303797

6161627,5,B00HFC30A8,"Extremely good anime that starts off as ""CSI Sci-fi"" and morphs into a fairly competent, if unoriginal, anime plot set in a dystopian society where Japan is the only country on earth that has any sort of law enforcement at all, but it is governed by a computer system that detects crimes before they happened.
The big things this show has going for it are the wonderful writing and good character development. You can actually see the growing up that some of the characters go through, as opposed to other shows that don't quite get it right. While the typical anime tropes are here, they are well done to the point where it won't bother you to watch it.
The show changes focus quite a bit around the end of this blu-ray going into part 2. Both are definitely worth watching, especially if you like Sci-fi. I don't think it will convert you if you don't though. I would have liked to have given this a 9.5/10 but, I'll round up because it really is alot of fun.",1426377600,,961,4.404494382022472
6161628,3,B00HFC30A8,"This show is very dark! It's a bit much for me but as a movie/show critique I can still take a step back and give an honest and unbiased opinion as possible. The show revolves around the idea of free will and the old theory that mankind would always choose to be evil when given the choice. Think The Giver, but not so advance as to have evil thoughts and decisions under control via vaccination, but rather under a heavy law enforcement. Everyone is monitored for their thought patterns (their Psycho pass). if you start to think what society aka the few up top think is evil then you are sent to rehab. The law is extremely strict, the punishment inhumanly harsh and this is where it gets really dark/gore and yet thought provoking. what is evil? if I believe I am doing good in the long run am I really bad? those kind of things. The animation is really well done, the motions, facial expressions and general movement on par with Cowboy Bebop. Setting has a lot of dark tones, neon and natural grit for the urban setting very similar to Batman Beyond and Ghost in the Shell. The characters are complex and have enough back story to successfully fill the whole season comfortably and develop well. However the end isn't very satisfying and the music is good but not memorable. There were a few plot holes and situations that could have been solved sooner or were ignored. Overall I give it three stars and recommend watching it with an open mind.",1423267200,2,1448,4.509505703422053
6161629,5,B00HFC30A8,"This show great! It starts off kinda slow at getting you interested but as soon as you hit the end of episode 5, it picks up fast and holds your interest easily. It seems to get better the further along you go.

I'm just sad that there aren't more episodes yet and hope they make more.",1422403200,,285,4.089285714285714
6161630,5,B00HFC30A8,"love this anime. I used this anime series to introduce my sister to anime for the first time. It has just the right balance of action, character development, plot twists and story line, but isn't a million episodes long so it's a great intro anime! highly recommend",1420934400,,265,4.659574468085107

6161632,5,B00HFC30A8,"I wrote this review to bring some attention to a great anime that did a terrible job of promoting itself. It's a series full of surprises and rich with themes set in a unique vision of society's future, yet all of this is hidden behind an uninspiring name and seemingly bland character design (don't get me wrong, the artistic direction itself is excellent).

It didn't help that the first two episodes gave me the impression that I was going to be watching a cliched romcom about an archetypal-submissive-anime girl and her rookie cop antics. After the first two ""kiddie"" episodes, I almost quit and never looked back, but I am glad that I gave the series a closer look. The story suddenly veers in a different direction entirely, becoming darker and darker at a gripping pace. The result is a sense of growing anxiety as we realize that the disconnected murders are much more sinister in their implications. Imagine the world of Minority Report (Tom Cruise) with the tone of Se7en (Brad Pitt). By the sixth episode, I was hooked on this ""sociological thriller.""

More than anything, the characters and philosophical themes make this series. There are unexpected subtleties here, too. The heroine, at every instance in which we think she will react in a stereotypical melodramatic fashion, surprises us by maintaining the steady poise befitting a detective with an exceptional psycho-pass (a term used that indicates a person's mental health as monitored by omnipresent government systems). Who we thought to be a minor character, a handsome and brooding male Enforcer, turns out to be a worthy lead with complex motivations and principles. The character designs themselves were so generic that I never expected distinct characterization, but the players become fleshed out expertly, with every officer acting in ways that are believable and consistent. The more the story developed, the more I found that I liked these people, even the irritable commanding officer--even the ""bad guys"" whose motivations I found sympathetic but whose methods I could never stomach.

The themes work because the writers never shove ideas down my throat in place of the story. Aside from the more obvious question of whether we are all willingly going down the route towards an Internet police state, I found more interesting the themes regarding deviance. If criminals knowingly break the law, and artists strive to be different from the norm, then don't these people share the same tendencies? In simply observing the system, don't we change the system?

Considering its many strengths, does Psycho-Pass also have some rough edges? Yes, in addition to the ill-fitting opening episodes, a few story arcs contained glaring plot holes. And inexplicably, some scenes force long expositions upon the viewer when action is obviously called for. At other times, the writing goes overboard in its artistic zeal--quotations from poetry, Max Weber, and Jonathan Swift were welcome, but a sprinkle would have gotten the point across. Nevertheless, I found these flaws to be minor compared to the consistently skillful directing.

I watched this first season of Psycho-Pass subtitled, in the ""extended edition"" cut, which pairs off the 22 episodes to make a set of 11 long episodes. Initially thought to be yet another idiosyncratic approach by the creators, I realized that this arrangement tightened the story's pace and created more satisfying conclusions. Although explicit violence and cyberpunk jargon may not be for everyone, I recommend taking a chance on this surprising gem.",1420675200,,3557,5.179130434782609
6161633,5,B00HFC30A8,"This is a high recommentation if Futuristic Drama are what you like in an anime. Set in the year 2113 Akane Tsunemori become the new kid on the block so to speak as she joins the police force known as Unit One. She then starts learning the ropes of the so called Psycho-pass system which is where your rating of insanity is rated to see if you actions will cause problems for everyone else from someone who is insane too Shinya Kogami a tall black hair fellow who seems stable but has is really mentally unstable can Akane stay in the right or will she die trying? This is just a brief outlook of the series outside that the shipping great it arived 1 day earlier than was said and it was packaged was perfectly rapped.

6161634,3,B00HFC30A8,"The first Psycho Pass is a bit of a shonen show (as all the canon mangas are in Comic Garden or Jump SQ and a chibi version also exists) that looked and sounded like it was seinen but retarded detectives, a nonsensical and inconsistent world, complete sh*tshows like the highschool killing arc, saturday morning cartoon villainy (MGS Rising robot dog represent!), an inconsistent amounts of mostly off-screen violence and bland action men (or men with vaginas) characters made me drop it after 16 episodes and i finish it when i speed read the identical manga (well it does have corpse nudity) from that part. A borderline 6/10 because of the production values. Worst of all i got to read for a year straight how ""cerebral"" and intelligent it was while actual sci-fi seinen fare like GITS: Sleepless Eye (9,5/10) never crossed the border. But read my review of the sequel (when amazon puts it up) to find out that the franchise can be way better as season 2 is a very different 8/10.",1417305600,,983,4.687861271676301

6161643,5,B00HFC30A8,"Loved this one! Great premise (a central computer has replaced police officers with Inspectors and Enforcers who arrest you when your potential for crime exceeds a set threshold). Add a rookie inspector and an enforcer obsessed with chasing a serial killer and it's very compelling.
The interactions between the characters are complex, there are great little touches in the background (loved the decorate-what-you-want virtual homes), and it has a thoroughly satisfying ending. It was a watch twice and then buy it for me.",1412121600,,522,5.301204819277109
6161644,5,B00HFC30A8,"Most anime appears to be geared toward children and young adults; still enjoyable but not necessarily the best choice for a mature person. However, there are exceptions, and this is one of them. It's got a story, intriguing characters and a concept that would probably do well as the basis for a near-future, sci-fi oriented, live action film.

What if an AI (artificial intelligence) could identify people with criminal intent, or even criminal personality traits? What if said AI could then met out whatever punishment it determined was appropriate, including execution? What if society was reliant upon this system to maintain law, order and public safety? Have I piqued your interest?

So with that out of the way, let me say that this might well be my favorite anime. It's top notch in every respect. I'm not an anime expert nor a movie critic. I write the occasional product review when I've found an exceptional product. I don't presume to know what others may like and it is possible you may not appreciate Psycho-Pass as much as I. But I've just started Part Two and it's even better. So my advise (which is why you are reading this) is to give this one a try. It's that good.",1410912000,,1185,4.6923076923076925

6161648,4,B00HFC30A8,"I love cyberpunk as a genre, the atmosphere and setting is always top notch, yet it seems to be a tradition the a cyberpunk movie or show will have little to no plot. That's what makes this show different. Along side orgasmic visuals and superb animation this show offers interesting, though vaguely generic, characters and awesome mysteries with enough sick twisted content to make any guy happy. The show has one of my favorite styles of story telling in anime in which it starts out vaguely episodic, but the cases begin to intertwine and become one massive, thrilling plot (higurashi for example). If you are in the mood for a dark sci-if thriller I highly recommend trying this show out, and if for whatever reason you don't like the plot, the visuals will make up for it.

When it comes to the actual product I'm afraid I don't have much input. I don't pay a major amount of attention to the quality of what I watch, as long as I can't count the pixels and it doesn't sound like a wall of sound I'm happy. It comes with both DVD and blu ray which is a recent trend in North American anime releases that I love, and has great artwork to show the ark sphere of the show.",1408233600,,1174,4.385321100917431

It sounded to much like X files.  Anyway, I think this show has got it just right.  The story is very strong and very well paced.  The characters are well written, they are likable and believable. The worst thing in the show for me is the lead girls giant eyes (a pretty small complaint).  I kept thinking all the way through how this would be a great live action show.

I absolutely loved it.

Apparently it takes a lot of flack from Anime purists for how it incorporates computer animation but I thought the visuals were truly great and the story really is a great one about the potential future of technology. Very much inspired by Philip K Dick. So much so the characters actually have a discussion about him by name in one of the episodes.

Highly recommend it for anyone who may have not already seen it. I am late to the party checking it out, so for those who do watch Anime it is probably old news, but especially if you are like myself and only dabble in the world of Anime itself, I strongly recommend it.",1403568000,,837,4.284810126582278

Most of the characters are well developed, and the animation is great! Plot and story are also great, with (in my opinion) a really good dub. Part 1 comes with episodes 1 to 11, but it doesn't really have a lot of extras... The extras it does have are Commentaries, Textless opening and ending, trailers, and Psycho Pass at Sakura-Con Part 1.

6161671,4,B00HFC30A8,"Psycho Pass was a surprise for me.  While I had been intrigued by the trailer, I found the first two episodes extremely weak.  The show looked good, and had a decent amount of action, the uneven dramatics in episode 2, mixed with a very nasty, brutal kidnapping in the first episode left a bad taste in my mouth.  Still, I stuck with it, and by episode 4, I was hooked.

The characters are in very well written. While it took me some time for me to warm up to the two leads, once I got to the end of this set I was understanding them better, and felt for them as they struggled to find a balance between what is truly right, and what society tells them is right.  The side characters are just as entertaining, with Masaoka and Yuki being stand outs for me (with Yuki being a huge shock, since she really only plays a very minor role until the last three episodes).

The art is solid, although some of the design choices, especially when it comes to the characters' eyes, can take some getting use to.  The animation is beautiful, with a varied color palette used to create a vibrant and varied world.  While the urban settings are drab and run down, the cyber world is flush with bright colors and over the top character designs.  When the show moves to an all girls school it is awash with yellows and browns, creating a nostalgic world that seems almost out of place in the future.  The action scenes shine, with fluid animation, and some creative uses of CGI when the camera switches to a first person perspective.

Psycho Pass is violent, and can almost feel cruel.  This is a show where the heroes don't always make it in time, or they don't act fast enough, and because of that, some characters pay the ultimate price.  While the second episode turns the emotional dramatics up so high it almost becomes laughable, the rest of the series gets a more solid grasp of the serious nature of what these characters have to deal with, and allows their relationships to develop at a more natural pace.

I listened to the dub of this show, and I have to say, Funimation continues to turn out some very strong work.  While I still consider Shiki to be their best work, once the VA's get comfortable with their characters everyone turns in some stellar performances.

Technically the discs are strong.  Both the Blu Ray and the DVD turn out great pictures, although Blu Ray is just a bit more vibrant.  The audio is strong as well, with no drop outs, or weird distortions.  There aren't a ton of extras, but that's pretty much par for the course for most current releases.

For those who are looking for some dark, futuristic crime drama, I highly recommend Psycho Pass.  Now I just need to get my hands on volume 2!",1397347200,,2711,4.4363636363636365

6161673,4,B00HFC30A8,"It's Minority Report meets Silence of the Lambs by way of The X-Files in this stylish sci-fi crime thriller that, while drawing heavily from many different existing works and genres, still manages to keep you guessing - and wanting more!

Set in a dystopian near-future where ""justice"" is dictated by a computer surveillance system (NSA, anyone?) and meted out by government agents and expendable would-be criminals, called ""enforcers,"" with their slick-as-hell handguns of doom, Psycho-Pass tells the story of a new agent straight from the academy who teams up with a motley crew of fellow agents and enforcers at exactly the wrong time. One of the enforcers' past comes back to haunt them as a series of grisly murders rock the city, and shake the new agent's own idealistic worldview to its core.

I have thoroughly enjoyed this series so far, the first half of which builds to a devastating climax in episode 11.  The production is outstanding, the visuals are stunning, the sound is fantastic - even the J-pop/rock soundtrack is catchy.  But the real kudos here go to the writers and directors who pull off some pretty heavy-duty reflection on a number of serious themes (the relationship of human beings with technology, the nature of human freedom and morality, the relationship of the individual and society, just to name a few) all while entertaining us with intense action and emotional drama.  Yes, at times it slows down and gets mired in lengthy dialogue that sounds a bit too much like a freshman philosophy class at your local community college, but that is forgivable, considering the heavy subject matter.  And the action really is good, though, as others have said, it can get gory at times, if that kind of thing upsets you (but seriously, people, it's a cartoon, and the gore isn't even really that bad, so relax!).  It also has fleeting nudity, so I would give it a solid PG-13 rating as it is not appropriate for youngsters.

All that said, I would enthusiastically recommend this to any fans of serious, reflective sci-fi action and crime thrillers.",1396310400,3,2072,4.9
6161674,5,B00HFC30A8,"Pros:
Definitely adult in the manner of CSI, Blade Runner, Minority Report
Excellent character design
Superb animation and backgrounds
Seamless CG integration, especially the tech (love that Dominator)
Concise, intelligent, well-paced plot with good turns
Well rounded characters
Gory when required
Unique production style
Strong music and soundtrack
Pays homage to prior, classic sci-fi while carving out it's own niche

Con:
Only one season
Episodes seem a tad short as credits sometimes roll while story is still unfolding - watch credits to the end to make sure you don't miss anything in some episodes
Hard-baked English subs during titles
Possible hard subs in Japanese track (I watched only English)

Watch immediately, if you enjoy strong science fiction action with no high school silliness, fanservice or jetting nasal blood geysers. Psycho-Pass is my new favorite police Sci-Fi, depicting a utopian Japan with a deep dark secret at it's core. Suspenseful, gory and incredibly well written, Psycho-pass passes with flying colors! I can't wait for the movie. For English dialog fans, Funimation's ADR is perfect. I highly recommend this anime and hope many more like it come out on blu-ray.",1396051200,23,1199,5.372340425531915
6161675,5,B00HFC30A8,"Very cool show. Watched a clip of the 1st episode and got hooked. Heard a 2nd season and movie are in the works, can't wait.",1395705600,,124,4.0
6161676,5,B00HFC30A8,"Well I just finished the series and first let me say that this is an anime for adults, meaning that it contains content unsuitable for children (i.e. graphic violence, gore) mainly due to the context of said content.  Also, this is what I would call a ""deep thinker"" which seems to be somewhat difficult to find these days.

If you want to understand the main premise of this show without me spoiling it for you then just imagine a world where a brain scanning technology of some sort has been perfected to the point where a persons overall moral integrity can be measured and assigned a numerical value in relation to their overall mental stability.  Now imagine how difficult it would be to keep something so ideally practical out of our justice system. Its somewhat scary, isn't it?  Its definatly a type of surveilance that I never imagined before watching this show.

At first when i read about it online the plot of the show seemed stupid to me.  I thought they just took concepts from Minority Report (which I didn't really care for) and Ghost in the Shell and made them into a confused, tryhard lovechild, but I was wrong.  This show is nothing like Ghost in the Shell, and the concept of the justice system (called SIBYL I think) is much more believable than the quantum inference thingy they had going on in Minority Report.  The only similarities I see to GITS is the fact that this show is intelligent and the time setting seems to be in the same ballpark, but in that regard I only mean advanced technology and cityscapes of superstructures glowing with lights.  The psychological and philisophical aspects of this show remind me more of Batman since alot of the deep stuff comes from the bad guys.  Indeed, the criminals in this show are extremely well done and actually had a purpose to the random acts of violence they performed (which differs from more recent series ive watched, like AOT) so it doesnt just make me feel like they put blood and gore and killing in this show just so people can be like ""ooooh violence this is a good anime.""  Its also very well animated with some really good CG stuff, and they didn't rely on CG to animate the characters as much as other shows (I cant stand that, makes me feel like im watching a Wii game.)  The dark and gritty setting is really well done and works well with the plot to ""thrill"" you.  Also, very fluid action sequences which has thankfully become a standard of good anime these days.

This first part is really good, particularly towards the ending, and was perfectly paced.  It introduces you to the world of Inspectors and Enforcers (just watch the show) and how they work together, and successfully justifies their purpose as well.  The dub is really good, I particularly liked the lead male characters.  The opening them is okay but i really liked the drum and bass closing theme, and the second part of this show has one of the best opening themes ever, and as an added bonus its fully translated AND well translated.  The characters themselves are amazingly fleshed out.  Even the couple characters I didn't like at the beginning totally went 180 on me and I grew to love their personal aspects.  All of the personality traits blend together so well that you won't even notice it.  The series starts out with a glimpse into the future, but don't worry, this isn't the ending of the show (far from it in fact) and when this part eventually does come you will be not be dissapointed.  Every single case investigated in this show is just amazing, but i have to say there were scenes where my mouth was agape either from shock or bewilderment.  It seemed that there was an overall theme here and the best way to describe it is ""when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.""

I watch alot of anime of all kinds, old and new, and I have to say this is the best out of all the new shows ive watched (Attack on Titan, K, Accel World, SAO, C-Control).  Im sure all the AOT fans out there just cant bear to hear that AOT isn't the best show in the world, but it isn't (just my opinion really, if you haven't seen that show you should get on it!) and the fact that stuff like that and SAO are more popular than shows like this just disturbs me.  Dont get me wrong that stuff is really good, but in the end this show made me feel like I gained something from watching it.

Im gonna go ahead and review part 2, because what you see in part 1 is just the tip of the iceberg, this anime gets MUCH more serious.  Also there is going to be a Season 2 and a movie, but don't worry this show wraps things up very nicely at the end of this season.

Please give it a chance, you won't be dissapointed.",1395619200,10,4672,4.4125874125874125
6161677,5,B00HFC30A8,"Premise... In the year 2113 Japan is overseen by the Sibyl system which actively measures the mental state, personality and probability to commit crimes of its populace these assessments are known as a psycho pass. If a psycho pass is abnormal the individual is told to seek counseling, but if it's too high the individual is immediately pursued and apprehended unless lethal force is necessary. Enforcing the will of the Sibyl system is the public safety bureau's criminal investigation division comprised of inspectors and enforcers. Members of the bureau are issued a high tech handgun known as a dominator that maintains a constant connection with the Sibyl system which regulates the gun's lethality based on the suspect's current crime coefficient level.

Story... Akane is a new inspector of unit one of the public safety bureau's criminal
investigation division her job is to apprehend people with high psycho passes and investigate crimes while also overseeing latent criminals known as enforcers. Each investigation will bring her one step closer to transitioning from an inexperienced rookie to a hardened veteran while continuing to raise the question does the Sibyl system create an idealistic utopia or a repressive totalitarian dystopia.

The animation is gorgeous, the characters are compelling, the story is intriguing and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan and one of my favorite science fiction animes!

6161679,4,B00HFC30A8,"I am a big fan of this series especially season 1 so I am planning to get the Premier release and then just get the regular ones for the rest .

But compared to the Japanese release Bluray , the US release  price is the same for just 2- 3 episodes in one volume in the Japanese release,  I already have some of those limited edition since it came with the notes and script and I got the producer to sign one of them.

Funimation has pretty good ADR work and I hope they did this one justice since the japanese seiyuu did an awesome job on this title, making it sound real. So for now 4 star ,just from listening to the ADR in their trailer.

Unfortunately this anime didn't get as much exposure as it deserves becuase Funimation was still  pretty new in the simulcast business when they got this title. So hopefully and english dubb would help and then get Adult Swim to have this in their lineup.",1393027200,2,897,4.216374269005848

The story is of a society that can tell when a person is about to commit a crime, and sends out police to stop and apprehend the potential criminal. This anime is half of season one but I really enjoyed it and bought the second half also.
If you like Ghost in the Shell you will really enjoy this. Like Ghost it is a look and comment on our society while being an entertaining tale with great characters.
All I can say is when an anime mentions my favorite movie and author that is a wonderful way to get me at least to watch. Action fans and those who like a deeper meaning in their sci fi stories will both be surprised by how well this series does.",1502064000,,780,4.1381578947368425
