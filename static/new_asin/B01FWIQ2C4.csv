Here the young man's (Walter Janssen) time on this world has expired and the Grim Reaper (Bernhard Goetzke) has taken him away. Distort and refusing to believe the situation is hapless his fianc (Lil Dagover) reads that love is stronger than death. So death strikes a bargain with her. If she can save one of three men that are also about to expire she can save her betrothed.

The three people are from different lands and times. As each story unfolds we see that the same actors that played the original people also play the main characters in each scenario.

Will she succeed in the task by saving one or more of the soon to expire men?
If she does not succeed, is there any hope?
What would you do given the choices?

Who is to say what love really is?

This is based upon a dream that Frits Lang had as a child.

The only drawback on this version of the movie is that they use different fonts on the verbal displays in this silent film to depict the different eras and scenarios. It takes time to get use to the different fonts.",1525046400,,1118,4.330143540669856
