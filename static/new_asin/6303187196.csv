The opera stars have been together training for their careers in the opera since boyhood. Naturally they are very close. One of them is in love with the other, so he succumbs to vicious and violent jealousy when the object of his love marries someone else (a woman, Gong Li). This tears at the fabric of their lives and nearly destroys all of them. The cultural revolution sweeps through China, and in the end it does destroy them.

598969,4,6303187196,"As far as story and content goes this owes more than a little to The Last Emperor (1987), which is not surprising since Director Kaige Chen was a member of the cast of that film and no doubt was influenced by its success.  But stylistically, and especially as the film was directed and cut, ""Farewell, My Concubine"" is original and stands alone.  If The Last Emperor was a Western movie about the Chinese political experience in the Twentieth Century, then Farewell, My Concubine is a Chinese movie, influenced by the West, about that same experience.  While the former focused on the emperor and those around him, ""Farewell..."" focuses on two actors of the Beijing opera.

Admittedly, ""Farewell..."" is long (I saw the 157-minute version) and sometimes strays from it intent, but gains and maintains power and keeps our interest mainly because everything is presented in a starkly-lit, intensely focused manner.  The epic-like story itself is good if a little pedestrian at times.  The lavish and stunning sets in opulent color and design, are just fascinating to view.  Everything from the extras in the crowds to the porcelain for tea is carefully chosen and presented.  Particularly striking are the traditional costumes and makeup, shown to advantage through the fine camera work.  But what makes the film is the glimpse we get of the world of the Beijing opera and its traditions.  From the Dickensian boy's school for the actors to the intrigues with patrons and the political powers that be, there's the sense of a world beyond our experience.

The acting was also excellent.  The beautiful Gong Li, who played Duan's wife was captivating as she displayed a wide range of emotion.  Leslie Cheung as Dieyi, ""the concubine,"" and Fengyi Zhang as Duan, ""the king,"" were also excellent.  The boys who played the actors as children, especially the actor who played Douzi, were first rate.

599154,5,6303187196,"Not since Lawrence of Arabia has a film so successfully fused the personal with the epic, the grand drama of history with the melodrama of personal lives.  And I use the word ""melodrama"" in the best sense - not as a pejorative for excessive affect, but in its older meaning, to connote an emotional story distilled to its most potent, primal form.

Although it is easy (and not entirely incorrect) to assign significance to the subtext of sexual repression in China (sex and sexual abuse in many forms underlies nearly every important development in the film), it is only a small part of a much larger design.  Modern China's identity crisis runs far deeper than the film's surface themes. It is a reflection of a larger human failing to find social and moral codes that work. From before the Second World War to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, China and her people were whipsawed between various brands of hedonism and oppression, individualism with its attendant chaos and tyrannical conformity with its rigidly enforced social order. In the Dickensian story of two orphaned boys forced into servitude with a Beijing Opera troupe, it finds an uncanny metaphor in their struggle for personal identity, and against the repression of their own natures imposed by both internal and external forces.

Shitou is reared from childhood to play the king in the highly stylized traditional opera from which the film takes its title. He is by nature a sensualist, drinker, womanizer, and scoundrel.  He has also been molded, initially quite against his will, in the role of a celebrity - a beloved star and public face of China's high culture. His girlfriend Juxian (Gong Li) is a prostitute, to whom he almost accidentally proposes, making her (and himself) ""legitimate"" to the masses when he marries her.

Douzi is his acting partner, a homosexual who plays the role of the king's suicidal concubine in the same opera.  As in Elizabethan England, only men were traditionally allowed on-stage, so, in a sense, Douzi's role was also forced upon him - although the film strongly suggests that his sexuality was more a matter of nature than nurture (he was born with an extra finger, to symbolize that he was always ""different"" from the others). Ironically, he must hide his true sexual orientation from an adoring public, even as the unrequited love for his co-star brilliantly informs his performance as the concubine.

As we follow the men's struggles throughout China's tumultuous journey into the modern world, it becomes apparent that they have accepted and even embraced the roles that were initially foisted upon them by circumstance.  We come to realize that they may very well have chosen them, had they been given the freedom to do so. At the center is the romantic triangle between Shitou, Douzi, and Juxian.

All of which brilliantly sets the stage for one of the saddest third acts in cinema, in which the lines between free will and determinism, the necessity of circumstance and the will of the inner self, will blur, cross, and cross again.  Each of the three main characters will betray and publicly denounce the others in order to survive, will claim allegiance to one revolution or another, and perhaps even mean it for a time, to stay the hands of the revolutionaries, whose shifting ideologies by turns celebrate and threaten each of them.

In lesser hands such a story would be trite, morbid, and - well - melodramatic, in the bad sense of the word.  But director Chen Kaige has a unique personal connection with the material, in that he denounced his own father during the Cultural Revolution - an act which he bitterly regretted later. It is therefore with sympathy and genuine compassion that he tells his tale, rather than cheap sentiment or maudlin histrionics.

When made poorly a tale like this is insufferably turgid, awash with treacly tears. When made well - with care, precision, and truth - it is breathtaking.

This is my favorite Chinese film.",1378857600,6,3979,4.909090909090909
599155,5,6303187196,"In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera ""Farewell My Concubine"" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations.
The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.'

With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text.

Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics.
One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery.
Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas).

It is all those things I mentioned at the outset and yet, those things are what make it so fascinating and so compelling. This is one of those movies that you can't easily summarize or tell what it's about without reducing it to those simplicities.
The movie is very well done in all aspects, perhaps none so effectively as the performance by Leslie Cheung. It is driven forward between his character and the polar adversary portrayed by Gong Li. At the risk of an oversimplification, the strongest element of the movie is the dynamic between these two characters and their relationship to the third part of the love triangle that brings them together.

599221,5,6303187196,"The Play and the Historical Story

Farewell My Concubine is a play of Chinese Peking Opera.  It tells a historical story of the last moments of Xiang Yu, who was a warrior living around 200 BC.  Xiang Yu, also known as ""Hegemon-King of Western Chu"", led rebel force against the rule of Qin dynasty and played vital role in bringing down the Qin in a series of battles.  His military talents were widely acknowledged through these battles and at the height of his success, he ruled a vast land covering present-day five provinces in inner mainland China.  However, his rival Liu Bang, managed to outwit and defeated him eventually in the battle of Gaixia.  In this very last battle of Xiang Yu, Liu Bang's men trapped Xiang Yu's army and sung the songs of Western Chu, creating a false impression that Xiang Yu's home land was conquered by the Liu Bang.  This psychological trick worked as the morale of Xiang Yu's plummeted.  To not be in a hindrance, Xiang Yu's favourite concubine Consort Yu committed suicide by slitting the throat with the sword of Xiang Yu.  In desperate, Xiang Yu led the remaining several hundreds cavalry on a attempt to break out of the encirclement.  Ten times the number of enemies were on hot pursuit.  By the river of Wu, only 28 men were left with Xiang and he made last a few charges inflicting another dozens of casualties on the enemy before all his men perished.  Xiang then asked the ferrymen took his beloved War Horse Zhui back home.  Refusing taking on board, he then committed suicide, dead at 29.  His rival Liu Bang became the first emperor of Han Dynasty.

It is intrigue to ponder why this play was chosen in the film.  The making of Han Empire echos the making of People's Republic; Chen Dieyi, like the Concubine Yu, remained loyal to his art and his King even ages change and turn against him...etc.

The 1920s/30s China

People who read/watched ""to live"" might get easier to understand the film as they know the suffering of the ordinary Chinese back then.  Indeed, merely to live would be luxury for many Chinese during the first half of the 20th century.  In the 20s/30s, the country was torn apart by wars between numerous self-claimed warlords backed by the West powers.  The national economy was totally bankrupted; students got no job after graduation; millions of lives were claimed by a great famine and a fatal flood sweeping northern China.  In the later 1930s, another flood would cause death of millions. Several millions of refugees were created by these natural disasters and they were receiving no care.  The military governments were busy with hunting down communists and suppressing rival warlords. The genocide and other atrocities committed by Japanese during its invasion in the 1930s would just worsen the situation.  The British authority continued to allow export of opiums to China to leech the last blood of this ""Sick man of East Asia"".  Life expectancy of average Chinese reduced to less than 40 and 90% of the countrymen can not read...that is where the film starts.

The Peking Opera Troupe and the Child Abuse

Some people get shocked when they see the violence of child beating at the first half of the film and others claim that those violence were not necessary and also hard to understand.  This feeling might stem from short of knowledge of the set background.  As said above, it was an extremely hard time for most Chinese.  People become indifferent in hard times and could be incredibly cruel.

Opera performers, like prostitutes, were the lowest people back then.  The troupe in the film, like their counterparties, have to perform along the streets to earn some hardcore money to get their ends meet.  They are not short of competition.  So they have to perform their best in the hopes that some rich people might appreciate their show and spare them some money.  Their hard earned fame may eventually bring changes to their life as happened to the troupe in the film.  This however was very rare, most troupes were not that lucky.  This cruel reality drives the masters to be very harsh on their apprentices, expecting the strict approach may bring frutful returns.  On the other hand, those masters were not educated people (the lowest people don't receive any education).  They might not be very rude, but their approach was very simplistic. (Opera is a form of art, but not every performer is an artist, many view it merely a mean to make a living)  It is worth to add that Peking Opera requires perfomers able to perform singing as well as acrobatics.  The performers have to be trained in very early age and endure extreme hardships to keep their bodies flexible when they grow up. Because of these, many masters tend to use a military camp approach to train their apprentice.  From a culture perspective, many Chinese believe moderate corporal punishment is a way to educate boys.  This is an idea less favored today, but back then, it was still very popular and apparently people defined ""moderate"" differently.

Knowing the above may help explain why Shitou(Duan Xiaolou) beat Douzi(Chen Dieyi) so hard when he messed the lines before a guest (who later become their manager).  He was partly out of frustration as Douzi messed up again and this could be a once-in-life  chance to alter their life.  He was also terrified for the ill-tempered master may beat Douzi to death for his blunder.  So it is better for him to beat him up to prevent the master doing it by himself.  It was also a desperate attempt to pull back the eyeball of the guest by showing the cruel but exceptional ""disciplines"".
It works.

The Cultural Revolution and the Ban for Opera Performing

There is no shortage in books about CR.  One remarkable feature of that crazy age is the ban of all art forms except Yangbanxi, or the so called model opera.  There were only eight model opera and as the only form allowed they were played repeatly.  All these eight model opera center on praising the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party.  From an artistic view, they were craps.  In the film, Chen Dieyi made very sharp critics on those craps which caused him big troubles.

Like all the other forms of art, Peking opera perfomers were not able to perfom untill the end of CR.

Yuan Si Ye (The forth master Yuan) and his execution

Yuan was a character neglected by many reviewers.  He appreciated the Peking Opera as well as Chen Dieyi's performance.  He asked Chen to be his ""hong yan zhi ji"".  The concept refers to a soul mate of opposite sex, usually female who for some reason can only be the lover of someone.  Yuan was such that he craves the love from Chen and enjoyed every minutes when they were together, but he knows clear he could not replace the hegemon king whom Chen is so loyal to.

It is unclear under which crime was Yuan executed.  From the timeline, that was supposed to be during the so called anti-""three evils"" and anti-""five evils"" political campaign.  In fear his newly founded regime was toppled by enemies, Mao ordered to persecute over a million people who were the so called "" evils "".  The goverment claimed those people were gangsters, bandits, spies and anti-revolutionists who were sabotaging the course of ""new China"".  However, it appears many were shot with no solid proof.

Oddly enough, the only people I know of, besides me, who have seen (or heard of) this wonderful movie are those who have seen it with me.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese cinema, usually finding myself too much into immediate gratification to be able to endure long movies.  But this movie is compelling in so many ways, so I have seen it more than once.  Farewell My Concubine moves through time on different levels -- people, history, art.

599224,5,6303187196,"Indisputably one of the best films of the 90's, and, in my opinion, to date. Just reading a few of the reviews, each with its own interpretation of the themes and motifs, is enough for anyone to figure out that this film reaches out to every individual in a different way.

Leslie Cheung (RIP) forever set the standard for genderless beauty. Cheng Dieyi himself is an artwork, and is beautiful and captivating in the same way as a masterpiece. I find it interesting that some people see Dieyi and Xialou as the main characters, when others (esp Chinese) think it's Dieyi and Juxian. I personally think it's Dieyi and Juxian, and that Xiaolou is there less as a character in his own right (since he really doesn't have much of a personality, imho), but rather as a symbol of something that Dieyi and Juxian revolve around and can be easily replaced with another average man.

To fully appreciate the magic of this film, you really need to be willing to sit down with an open mind and be ready to pick up on small details, and then think about it as a bigger picture. It's not surprising that some people are turned off by the themes of homosexuality, abuse, and joyless sex. These themes are exactly what make this film so haunting. It's completely pointless to get offended by these themes, because Farewell My Concubine is not there as a reflection of anyone's political stance or moral values, and even less is it propaganda. Rather, it's an honest portrayal of the effects of having to live a life of betrayal and inner turmoil.",1260144000,2,1531,4.604395604395604
599225,5,6303187196,"In recent years Kaige Chen has made some very disappointing movies that look extravagent but really have no substance. But if you have seen Farewell, My Concubine, you'll agree that having made this film Kaige Chen can spend the rest of his life making crap and still call himself a good filmmaker.

This movie is, more than anything, a work of art. And it is extraordinary on a number of different levels.

First of all, it covers the Chinese history from 1920s to 1970s, a period in Chinese history whose volitility is unparalled by any other historical periods. The history is played out intimately in the lives of the two main characters. And the film plays out half a century of history without the least feeling of rush. There is an extraordinary attention to detail. In each time period presented, the historical context is applied to the most minute details: the way people dress, the way they talk... is all catered towards creating the most authentic historical experience.

Secondly, the film has presented such an amazing portrayal of Peking Opera. Including the piece ""Farewell, My Concubine"" itself, every piece of Peking Opera depicted in this film are carefully chosen. They fit in perfectly with the story and help to bring the depth to a whole new level.

Thirdly and most importantly, Leslie Cheung has displayed a quality beyond the word ""beauty"". Many superficial film critiques claim that this is a movie about homosexuality. But that is not true. It is a movie about beauty and about art. In the character played by Leslie Cheung, gender simply becomes irrelevant. He is the embodiment of a state of mind, that is at once feminin and masculin. From him you see the purest of humanity: beauty, love, loyalty, and a complete devotion to art...
What most people don't know is that when the story was initially written by a famous Hong Kong novelist, the writer herself in fact wrote the story with Leslie Cheung in mind. In a way, the character Cheng Dieyi was made for Leslie Cheung. Or should we say, Leslie Cheung was made for Cheng Dieyi.

Nowadays, in Chinese theatre and in world theatre, movies are becoming increasing commercial. More and more of them are made to please the audience and to hit the box office. And it is harder and harder to find films that are made for the sake of art.
In that sense, Farewell my Concubine is the legacy of a time when filmmakers were still artists.",1241568000,6,2412,4.733333333333333

599228,4,6303187196,"I expected a love triangle - as stated on the DVD cover but this film is about so much more. It is an historical epic of gigantic proportions covering about fifty years of Chinese history. The film also serves as a metaphor for the lives of the actors. Viewed without proper insight, the viewer could miss many of the fine qualities associated with this film. The DVD cover attests 1)over 60 Critics had agreed it was one of the year's 10 best films in 1993, 2) it won the prestigious ""Best Picture Honors"" at the Cannes Film Festival, and 3) it won a Golden Globe as best foreign film. The film is highly artistic when viewed from multiple perspectives: the obvious surface view, the delicate and sensitive themes of male friendship/bonding, romantic love, political/historical changes, and the depth of human relationships which are thoroughly explored.

It is about the training of young boys to be actors in the Peking Opera Academy which performs classical Chinese opera in large cities during tumultous times in China's history. They perform a classic piece about an Emperor who is deposed and his concubine, who makes the ultimate sacrifice for him: she commits suicide out of love and loyalty. Primarily, the film focuses on the lives of two specific actors, who become best friends from childhood well into adulthood. They suffer severe punishment in their early training for their stage roles and eventually become famous. Each plays one of the starring roles in this classic called ""Farewell My Concubine"" which is a famous and favorite Chinese opera. One plays the Emperor and the other his Concubine. The two actors are inextricably bound as friends and actors due to this Opera. Tensions develop in their adult friendship and relationship because one of them falls in love with a prostitute and marries her. Their relationship is obviously strained due to this marriage but the problems go much deeper. There are political upheavals which cause a great deal of stress and strife in the lives of the Chinese people and the opera performers are forced to perform under circumstances against their wills but they do so - to save their lives. Later, during Mao Tse Tung's ""Cultural Revolution"" - the actors are put on trial for their perceived political stance in the previous regime.

The roots of this film run very deep. The film explores risky areas of human relationships, one of which includes male bonding which becomes a deeper same sex love desire that remains unfulfilled. It lasts 172 minutes which is nearly 3 hours, so one must really desire to see it and commit the necessary time for full appreciation. While I liked the film, I will give it only four stars despite the rave reviews by professional critics because some areas could have been cut shorter, without any loss of its artistry or depth.

599283,5,6303187196,"Before seeing Leslie Cheung in Farewell My Concubine, I had seen him in approximately a dozen other movies, playing everything from macho police cadet to romantic hero to gay gigolo.  He was equally impressive in each of these roles.  But when I saw him portray Dousi in Farewell My Concubine, I saw the true extent of his brilliance.  I can't imagine that anyone else could have portrayed this role so convincingly.  Other reviewers have explained the story far better than I can, so I will not bore you with those details.

However, for me, the major theme of this movie is betrayal.  Dousi (Cheung) is the soft, effeminate, sensitive one who plays the part of the Concubine to his longtime friend, (Zhang Fengi's) Shitou's macho role of the King in the opera which defines their lives from the age of 16 until their 40's. The title of the movie takes its name from the opera for which they are famous, ""Farewell My Concubine.""  Although it is Shitou who is portrayed as the strong masculine partner, it is Dousi who shows the greatest courage and self-sacrifice in the face of danger and loss throughout all the years he and Shitou are together as friends and acting partners.  It is obvious that Dousi has a deep love for Shitou both as a friend and as a soulmate.  However, Shitou is attracted only to women and sees Dousi as a friend and acting partner only. Yet,  he is not above exploiting Dousi's love for him for his own benefit. Although Shitou does have a feeling of friendship to Dousi and cares about him in his own way, Shitou is often callous and insensitive to Dousi. He is betrayed on numerous occasions by both Shitou and the woman Shitou marries.  However, it is Shitou's ultimately selfish and cruel betrayal of Dousi after the Japanese occupation of China that you see the depth of Shitou's cowardice.  Seemingly, without hesitation, he abandons Dousi by telling lies and saying and doing whatever he thinks is necessary to save himself from the Japanese officers' wrath.  With great loyalty and love, Dousi remains silent and courageously faces the ensuing consequences rather than risk harm to his beloved Shitou.

Since the movie takes place over a period of approximately 40 years, there are a lot of political changes which take place in China during this time frame.  However, even if you are not familiar with China's history, it is explained well enough that you will not be confused.  The movie is visually stunning and the acting superb.  Still, it is Leslie Cheung's portrayal of Dousi, the ""concubine,"" which makes this movie worth seeing and owning.  I was surprised that the movie's length is approximately 3 hours long, because it moves along so swiftly yet effortlessly.  Leslie Cheung's performance is heart-breaking and made even more so given his later real-life suicide.  I can't help but feel that, at least part of the time, we are seeing the ""real"" Leslie Cheung onscreen and not just the part he is playing.  The movie is beautiful and moving and artistic.  It is a masterpiece.",1191024000,2,3024,4.775

I was never terribly excited by Leslie as a serious actor, that was until I saw this film.  Seeing him in Farewell, My Concubine was like being struck by lightening.  Now, for the first time, I understand ""Leslie love"".

As others have noted, this film is long; my copy clocks in at 172 minutes. However, I did find that any section was weak or dragged on. For me, it was the brilliant performance by Leslie Cheung as Cheng that kept the film centered. As the violent political atmosphere of China from 1924-1977 throws danger and traps in his path, Cheng clings to and embodies the spirit of the opera. His obsessive nature serves him on his climb to fame and in the end destroys him. Cheung's performance is incredible and I will certainly be watching more of his films.

I thought Gong Li's performance was impressive as well. With one look, she is able to convey crushing disappointment and hopelessness. It is heart wrenching.

I thought Zhang Fengyi's Xiaolou was a little uneven. His transformation from beginning to end rang a little false and, from what I could understand, didn't quite fit the ""King & Concubine"" theme running through the film. I did think, however that Cheng and Xiaolou were interesting contrasts and helped add that touch of melodrama.

I was happily surprised by the bond/love shared by the two male characters since childhood. When you read that there's a love triangle and you see that there are two men and one woman, one usually assumes that both men will be in love with her.

Their training is at times brutal and sadistic but, it molds them into classicly trained incredible actors who's lives go through upheaval after another until the final straw when one of them falls in love with a woman and marries her creating a love triangle that comes to an unexpected conclusion.
Despite history marching by these two actors, they become known for the roles they continually recreate with perfection time after time, one playing a king and the other his concubine.
Through World War II, the takeover by the Communists, and through the Cultural Revolution, they are always famed as well as shamed, for their acting and the perfection in the same dramatic play roles.
Meticulous acting by Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi as the two boy/men actors, and Gong Li plays the woman that comes between them make this a film worth seeing more than once.
This film is one of the best foreign films I have watched in years. I had to wait almost 4 months before I could rent it. It was always checked out or reserved. When I was successful, it was worth the wait. I would call the film eye candy as it fills the screen with enough to warrant two or more viewings, one right after the other, not because it's subtitled but, because there so much to take in with the characters, scenery, cinematography and the plot.
Bold subject matter for a mainstream film and definately oscar worthy (it recieved 2 oscar nods) and deserving of the Cannes Film Festival 1993 award it recieved when it tied for top honors. Despite all of it's merits and what critical acclaim and awards it's won, it's subject matter and bold realism offended the Chinese government which created a lot of difficulty getting approval, and the film almost didn't get made or released. Since then, it's success has had a great 'positive' influence and thankfully, the government finally relented and has sang the film's praises, since.

599373,5,6303187196,"""Farewell My Concubine"" is the shattering story of two stars of the Beijing Opera whose friendship is torn apart by personal betrayals against the backdrop of the political turmoil of 20c. China. Two young boys endure the brutal training at a famous school and emerge as stars, their fame growing from their roles as the general and concubine in the famous opera which lends its name to the movie. The first and perhaps irreparable breach occurs when one marries--it is clear that their relationship runs more deeply than friendship, at least for one of them. But tragic events overcome this very personal crisis as the Japanese invade, the Nationalists repulse them, the Communists rise, and finally the Cultural Revolution destroys these two men, who really care only to practice their art. The opera itself ends up replaying itself over and over in the lives of the main characters.

This is a long, difficult but very rewarding film. Made by a Chinese director, it's an authentic, not Westernized, view of Chinese art and society. Beijing opera as an art form is quite inaccessible to Westerners, from the stylized movements, to the crashing cymbals and most of all the screechy sounding singing (at least to our ears). It's hard to understand how young boys could be so moved as to cry as they watch a performance. But after awhile, as the film returns to the same scene over and over, the ritual seemed less alien to me, even beautiful. The film may seem slow at times, and the brutality of the school is hard to watch. But it's real drama and tragedy, and worth your time.",1149984000,11,1579,4.762773722627737

And after watching this masterpiece, I can understand why and can't think of a more deserving film to have such a title.  The film is a depressing and heartbreaking journey, chornicling the struggles of two peking opera performers and the woman that seemingly changes their lives and their relationship forever.  However, the film also speaks on many other levels, touching on issues such as the massive abuse of child performers in the peking opera as well as the issue of homosexuality that seemed to be so closely guarded during this time as well.  Additionally, the film gives an accurate account of China's history and the many political struggles that people of China had to endure through.  Watching friends become enemies due to one change in government was heartbreaking, and at times too disturbing to watch.  Yet that's what makes this a powerful film, and one that needs to be watched by everyone.

The acting in the film is dominated by the performances of three main actors and actresses: Leslie Cheung, known for his Wong Kar Wai roles in Days of Being Wild and Happy Together, which earned Wai Best Director nods at the 1997 Cannes, Gong Li, known for her recent role in Memoirs of A Geisha, and Zhang FengYi.  Now Leslie Cheung and Gong Li definitely lived up to their promise, and i was extremely impressed with their acting as well as the way they promoted their roles, especially Cheung, who had to play the role of a discreet homosexual actor, which was probably not an easy role, especially after a role as a ladies man in Days of Being Wild.  However, while Cheung and Li should be commended for their roles, FengYi was the one that stood out the most.  Granted, the film did focus more on his character than Cheung in many cases, but he demosntrated true emotion and effort in a character that was very complex.  When one sees this film, it will be quite easy to understand that his role is not an easy one, due to his up and down character which never really takes a hard stance on anything but acting troughout the movie.

The directing of the movie should also be commended as well.  This being my first Chen Kaige film i was a little spectical because it is common from reviews that he is an overrated director in many aspects of filmmaking.  However, I believe comments like those are false, because this film was extremely well-paced and not only that, but it remained intense throughout, which is the signal that a director can keep his or her audience focused throughout the whole film.  While many people may object to his style of filmmaking, Chen Kaige is a fabulous director and I look forward to his upcoming film, The Promise, coming out in theaters on May 5.

Farwell My Concubine is a history on many levels.  In some cases it is a history of China.  In other cases it is a history of the Peking Opera, studying both its good and bad aspects.  And in some cases, it is a study of homosexuality in China during the early 20th century and how safeguarded it was during this time.  Yet whatever one may think the purpose of this film is, it remains a story about friendship, and the challenges two friends went through during the most troublesome of times in Chinese history.  And in terms of that, it is one fantastic story to say the least.  It may not be the easiest movie to stomach, but ""Farewell My Concubine"" is a film that must be seen by every avid film fan.",1145232000,9,3552,4.578199052132701

599427,5,6303187196,"It didn't take long to get drawn into ""Farewell My Concubine"".  From the beginning, the acting, directing, sets, costumes, and overall majesty of the movie had me convinced that this was time well-spent.  I was a little lost initially as I followed the story of two boys in China who suffer through their determined goal to become opera stars.  However, as the years of beatings and suffering unfolded in their acting school, I realized just what an obsession that our two main characters had.  As the movie progressed, it was interesting how each of the two dealt with their common obsession.  To further illustrate this, a third person gets involved in their lives and we see how the three different persons handle their own obsessions; to what extent they will go to preserve or obtain what they want the most.  Ultimately, this was the imagery I took away from ""Farewell My Concubine"".  While I did not always accept the outcome of these and other individuals, the movie challenged me to dwell on what I had seen.

For me, the additional impact of ""Farewell My Concubine""  was the portrayal of the history of China from the era of the warlords through the post ""Gang of Four"" era.  With each change in between we are given a telling glimpse of its' impact on the people of China.  Of special interest for me was the focus of the various phases of the communist rule such as the initial asumption of power to through the cultural revolution to the near present.  I found myself reflecting on ""The Last Emperor"" and ""One Man's Bible"".  The former, a movie, did a tremendous job of bringing this same history to life but weakened when dealing with Communist China.  The latter, a book by Gao Xingjian, focussed primarily of the different phases of the communist rule.  ""Farewell My Concubine"" falls somewhere in between those two for revealing what China went through in the 20th Century.  As a history buff, I appreciated that.

""Farewell My Concubine"" is nearly a 3 hour movie in Chinese with subtitles.  I did not think it overly long although I sometimes wondered where it was headed.  Perhaps the early days may have stretched out a bit but then I might not have cracked up at the line ""Who gave you permission to stand?"".  Sometimes it's hard to truly appreciate a movie that leaves you with a depressing feeling.  One man weathered everything for something that meant so much to him.  When he lost that focuss, he lost it all.  His loss was our gain.",1130716800,10,2458,4.665116279069768

599432,5,6303187196,"As a mainland Chinese, I think this is the best film that mainland China EVER made. The film, spanning from 1930s to 1970s, covered the most turmoil time of recent Chinese history. The three main characters are just a vechicle that carried us through the several decades. It's a history that you won't hear a lot of Chinese talk about. But you can be assured that it's always somewhere in a corner in their minds.

To watch this movie, is to watch China's pain and deep wounds of that couldn't be articulated in words or understood from history books. And I am not even sure if I can call them scars because I don't think they ever fully healed.

I was often amazed by the warm reception by US audience for the trashy Chinese films such as ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" while great movies such as this one went on unnoticed. But on the other hand, although I own the DVD, I don't watch it as often. It's just too disturbing, too haunting. There wasn't one slice of entertainment in this movie. Definitely not recommended after a happy Saturday night family dinner. But if you ever want to be reminded that movies are also witness to our history and our darkest hours, this is the one.

By the way, the cover doesn't do the movie justice at all. And if you were ever led to expect anything by the cover, then you got it all wrong. The movie couldn't be further away from what the cover might have suggested.",1112832000,15,1420,4.432950191570881

I don't usually go in for DVD extras, but I would have loved to know more about the making of this extraordinary film.

599484,5,6303187196,"It took several viewings of Farewell My Concubine before it became ***** stars for me. There was so much to take in from different aspects. The first time I watched FMC was because it was a Leslie Cheung film [long after it was originally released]. Beautiful as the concubine was, I was disappointed that the handsome Leslie was barely recognizable. The story seemed complicated because I didn't understand the historical period it was set in. The next time I watched this movie I had read up on the history of the time and the Peking opera style. Then Farewell My Concubine became a sad and devastating story. I found the scenes such as the mother cutting off young Dieyi's finger, the harsh punishment doled out to the all the young students and especially the torture of Dieyi for not being able to get his mind around the phrase that changed his sexual identity, particularly cruel. The invading soldiers and later cultural revolution seem to depict the history books well from certain points of view.
I was compelled to watch this movie the third time after learning about Leslie Cheung's dedication to his role. How he arrived in China 6 months early to learn to speak Mandarin. He had previously recorded several albums in Mandarin but speaking the language convincingly in a dialog would be very different. He also spent much time learning the intricate art of the Peking opera from masters on the Mainland. As a native Hong Konger, it was a also a challenge for Leslie to travel to the Mainland for the first time at the age of 33, knowing that his family fled from there just a generation ago.
So, at last, with the sad and haunting story, my history lesson learned and understanding the hard work and dedication of Leslie Cheung to venture to China to undertake this project, Farewell My Concubine became ***** stars in my books!",1106265600,12,1841,4.720496894409938

Indeed, when he is fully dressed in his opera regalia he appears totally androgynous. You just wouldn't know. I will not be buying this dvd because it has many important scenes cut out, presumably to make it easier on western viewers.  I have a vested interest in Beijing opera and yet many of those scenes were cut. They also cut out a molestation scene with Douzi when he was a boy, which, although horrifying, is an integral part to the build of his character.

599487,5,6303187196,"Farewell My Concubine spans fifty years, from traditional China in 1927 to post-Mao Zedong in 1977.  It is an unbelieveable cinematic achievement, with glorious, exquisite costumes and supreme actors.  It is the story of two boys who grow up to be stars in the Beijing Opera.  One boy plays the King, the other his concubine.  Many men played female roles with great skill, earning them great admiration and honor.

Beijing Opera is a very important part of Chinese culture.  From the late 1700's until Mao's Cultural Revolution in the 60's, whole towns would thrill to the arrival of the stars.  The performance included dazzling acrobatics, sumptuous costumed court ladies, generals, gods, scholars, and warriors.  Today, Beijing Opera is not as popular.  Although it is shown on state-run Chinese television, it is difficult to compete with more modern entertainment such as movies, sports, and the Internet.  Like other ancient arts, Beijing Opera will fade away without support.  Farewell My Concubine brings it back to life in such a stunning manner, you will weep to see this art revived to it's former glory.

The beginning of the movie deals with the boys' difficult childhood.  They are being trained by a master of opera.  The master's methods may seem harsh, but he really wants the best for the boys' futures.  Mostly street orphans, the master knows that the only future they may have is actors in the Opera.  However, the master cannot protect young Douzi from the pedophiliac clutches of a wealthy patron of the troupe.  These early scenes are very difficult to watch, but they set the stage for the tragic character Douzi grows up into.  Douzi's adult name is Dieyi, his friend Shitou becomes Xiaolou.

Gong Li is the only actress in this male-dominated film.  She gives a great performance, per usual.  She plays a street-smart prostitute who contrives to marry Xiaolo, so she can escape life in the brothel.  There is instant, intense competition and hatred between her and Dieyi over Xiaolou.

You cannot watch this movie without weeping.  It deserved the Palm D'Or it received at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.  You will have a new appreciation for Chinese culture, and especially for Chinese Opera after watching this film.  The film is long, just about three hours, but it is worth every minute.

599539,5,6303187196,"Farewell My Concubine is about loss of identity.  It is a study in how a person reacts to a slow and methodical stripping away of self.  Because of this, the movie is almost a psychological study.  Many people may think it is about repressed homosexuality in China, but they are missing the primary point.
 The movie's main character, Cheng Dieyi, is the person most impacted by loss of identity, though it is also experienced by the other main characters as well.  From the castration/mutilation inflicted on him by his mother at the beginning to his eventual suicide, it's as though layer by layer of his being is slowly peeled away.  Let me for a moment simply regurgitate the way in which this happened.
 Cheng Dieyi was born as a prostitute's son.  From the very beginning, he would be considered a bastard child in almost every culture.  His mother claims that he is getting in the way of her ""business"" at the local brothel and she seeks a way to be rid of him.  She winds up taking him to a local acting troupe and when they refuse to take him because of his sixth finger on one hand, Dieyi's mother cuts it off.  This can easily be seen as the act of castration.  Then his identity is further stripped away by the acting troupe drilling it into his head that he is a woman, since he plays a woman in the theater.  From this point on, he associates his lost masculinity with his best friend, Duan Xiaolou.  However, even his friendship is taken away when Xiaolou becomes involved with-guess who-a prostitute.  It should be apparent to all who see it, that the hatred he feels toward the prostitute, Ju Xian, is not only because she is taking away his confidant, but also because she reminds Dieyi of his mother.  Like many people confronted with loss of identity, Dieyi seeks an avenue of escape by doing drugs.  The last thing which he is able to keep as his identity is the role he performs on the stage as a concubine for the king of Chu-but even this is eventually lost when he is replaced by a child who he helps to rear.
 Dieyi isn't the only one who loses his identity, however.  Ju Xian struggled to rid herself of the emotional baggage attached to being a prostitute.  She became involved with Xiaolou hoping to build a family and achieve some normalcy.  However, Dieyi's relationship with Xiaolou complicates matters, and when she loses her unborn child almost all hope is lost.  When Xiaolou disavows any love for her, her dream is shattered and she commits suicide.
 From these two examples in the movie, one can see how one emotionally could be driven to suicide.  Dieyi's loss of identity involves the stripping away of every aspect of his masculine self and a devaluation of things which he holds dear.  Many people evaluate his relationship to Xialou as a homosexual one, and while it seems to be the case, I would argue that the relationship could also be merely one of a protector-devotee nature or possibly even an older-brother-younger-brother relationship.  Ju Xian, likewise loses her self-respect by being a prostitute and later loses everything which could pull her out of this psychological trap.  Since the events in China played a role in these two personal losses of identity, it is possible that the movie was simply expressing the author's personal sense of loss at the hands of a repressive cultural history.  On the other hand, the fact that many events compound the loss of identity could simply be a way of showing how external forces can influence one's own sense of self.  This last possibility is probably the author's intent, since the story could easily be told within the context of any tumultuous period-such as the United States during the Vietnam War era.
 The end confirms my view of the film's portrayal of self-identity loss when Dieyi messes up the line in the play and says he is a boy not a girl.  Throughout his life his identity as a man had been taken away.  He struggled against it, was conquered by it, and eventually asserted what power he had left in the act of suicide.  I felt tired and emotionally drained at the end of the movie.  Farewell My Concubine, unlike any other film I have seen, superbly depicts human nature and is very insightful.  It should be declared a masterpiece of not only Chinese cinema, but of film the world over.",1067126400,82,4303,4.624505928853755
599540,5,6303187196,"This award-winning 1993 Chinese film is an epic in every sense of the word.  It is not only the story of some very interesting characters, it is also the story of the Peking Opera as well as modern Chinese history from 1924 to 1977.  It is beautiful and sad and violent and romantic.  And, along the way, I learned a lot about Chinese opera.
The performers are all male, and training for the young boys is harsh.  Apprentices start in early childhood.  They are beaten often for such infractions as forgetting their lines.  They are forced to kneel for hours holding up buckets water.  They are stretched into split positions in torturous agony. And yet, as we follow the story of two of these young boys, we come to understand that this horrible treatment resulted in classically trained performers, some of whom rose to great fame.
This is the story of two young orphan friends, Dousi and Shitou, played by three sets of actors depicting their childhood, then adolescence, then adulthood (and cast so well that it really seemed like the same actors growing up).  Dousi is more delicate and excels in the role of the concubine.  Shitou is more robust and always plays the king in ""Farewell My Concubine"" which is a classic Chinese opera.  It's easy to see that Dousi is in love with Shitou but Shitou favors women and marries a the lovely Juxian, who he meets in a brothel. Immediately, there's a love triangle.
All this is set against the backdrop of first the Japanese invasion, then the Nationalist Army and then the Communists.  The characters suffer through all this and adapt and struggle.  There are horrible moments, especially when they renounce each other during the cultural revolution. My emotions were touched by their plight because I really felt I knew each of these people.  I didn't even mind the almost-three-hour-long film because it seemed I was actually living their lives right with them.  And there was no way it could have been told in a shorter time.
I loved this film.  It's disturbing, of course.  But yet, I came away with an understanding of China that I could never get from merely reading history books. Highly recommended.",1065744000,141,2155,4.752688172043011

if you are expecting kung-fu fighting, choreographed swordplay, or any other sort of monkey-antics some americans have come to associate with chinese filmmaking, do not watch this movie. your narrow mind might burst from the depth, breadth, and sheer beauty that radiates from every frame of this film, and the complexity of a plot that shows characters interacting with history and culture as much as they do with each other will completely escape you. if you're a viewer that's outraged by the audacity of the filmmakers behind such controversial films as, say, ""monty python and the holy grail"", this film is not for you. this film was not made in hollywood; do not expect a hollywood film. it is a film that is smart, unsettling, enlightening, and even educational, but the umbrella attribute that permeates the film above all and keeps us hypnotized is its breathtaking beauty...",1063497600,33,2800,5.010729613733906
599542,5,6303187196,Wow.  What a different movie.  It's nothing like what I was expecting.  That doesn't mean it's a bad film.  It's just different than any other HK film I've ever seen.  I think it breaks new ground and explores how childhood experiences can directly influence adulthood.  A boy falls in love with an opera story and tries to live it in real life--and starts to have homosexual tendencies because he plays the female character.  His opera co-star doesn't feel the same and falls in love with a prostitute whom he marries---the result is a love triangle of sorts that ends in tragedy.  Not to mention powerful men that fall in love with the male-playing-female because he acts the part of a woman so well.  Just watch it.,1055721600,4,718,4.634920634920635
599543,5,6303187196,"""Farewell My Concubine"" was released exactly 10 years ago (1993).  I  meant to rent it for the longest time, because I've heard nothing but rave reviews about the director, the actors, and the storyline.  I finally rented the director's cut DVD this weekend.  It was nearly 3 hours long and worth every minute of my time.  Sadly to say, Leslie Cheung, the male lead in the film, suddenly committed suicide in Hong Kong on April 1st.  His death prompted me to rent ""Farewell My Concubine,"" which I heard was one of the BEST performances of his career.
Cheung plays an emotionally tormented character, Douzi, who was raised in a strict and often brutal Beijing opera school.  The film follows Douzi from childhood to adulthood.  Cheung gave an emotional and moving performance.  The other actors in the cast, Gong Li (the beautiful and talented actress who starred in ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and ""Temptress Moon""), and actor Zhang Fengyi also gave outstanding performances.
Since Cheung's recent death, director Chen Kaige has said Leslie Cheung IS the character he played in ""Farewell My Concubine.""  There is a hint of sadness mixed with helplessness and charisma surrounding Cheung's character.  The dramatic and chilling ending moved me.  I highly recommend this film to not just fans of Chinese cinema, but to all audiences who can appreciate a beautifully acted, well scripted, and brilliantly shot film.",1049587200,115,1408,5.0476190476190474

In addition, the acting is simply superb, without a missed moment, action or gesture throughout the whole of the film.

599621,5,6303187196,"After living in Taiwan for more than a decade, I only became interested in Chinese film during my last few years there. This is one film that really makes me regret that.
In this film, Chen tells a gut-wrenching story of unrequited love, betrayal, and friendship. The story is triumphantly placed against the background of 20th century China, stumbling through decades of change and war. In a testament to his ability, Chen manages to masterfully weave the myriad themes and conflicts of the film into one striking tale. The clash between masculinity and femininity, love and friendship, ideology and survival--all of these and more are deftly engaged by Chen.
Every aspect of this film is as near perfect as it could be.
The cinematography is simply impeccable, which is really no surprise. Furthermore, the use of color is nothing short of brilliant. The splashes of red in the particularly dreary, gray scenes are particuarly striking. I really cannot give this film enough praise for its direction and cinematography. Chinese beauty Gong Li turns in a stellar performance, matched by those of Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fenyi.
Over the years, I have become a Zhang Yimou devotee, and find myself enjoying his films the most. ""Farewell My Concubine"" is a notable exception. Of all the 5th generation Chinese filmmakers, Chen receives considerable acclaim. Watching this film will leave no doubt in your mind as to has considerable talent. I also highly recommend ""Yellow Earth"", a lesser-known Chen film (cinematography by Zhang Yimou) that is widely considered the first breakthrough film of modern-day Chinese cinema.",1030492800,11,1619,5.159695817490494
599622,5,6303187196,"I have to confess here that Farewell my concubine got me into the far eastern cinema. After many advises from the Chinese friends (I was a student back then)I decided to see this film without expecting much. In the end I was stunned by the beauty and power of this film.
Kaige directs a story of 2 opera actor (friends) from their childhood to post cultural revolution China. From the opera training onwards we not only see their lives as actors that influenced by many events, we also witness the emergence of new China. With the time period stretching from the rise of the conciousness of nationalism ,story moves thru second world war and Japanese invasion, Chinese civil war and mao era. Kaige does a wonderful job of telling the stories of Chinese people and the effects of the  political climate over them. Confusion after confusion follows the characters on every turn of the history. Kaige tells his story with realistic camera shots and aided by excellent acting by Cheung,Li and Zhang. Portrayal of landscapes and people are all remarkable.
The lives of main characters are also well structured and told with aspects like the Cheung's hidden homosexuality and love towards his friend. Zhang and Cheung's friendship help them to overcome hard times. Also Gong Li's struggle to become a normal wife after living in brothel, is envied and challenged secretly by the Cheung. Just like the opera story film starts , emerges and ends tragically.
In sum , farewell my concubine is an award winner excellent movie. The film gets as realistic as it is without falling in to the trap of exaggerating any occasion. Both in terms of telling the story of characters as well as the climate in changing China, Kaige manages to balance everything so well and thus coming up with a classic. Check out to Live and Blue Kite also as similar films If you are interested .",1017964800,27,1861,4.761609907120743
599623,5,6303187196,"China had been through so many dramatic social transforms during the last century, from the feudal dynasty, the warlord period, the Japanese invasion, Republic of China, communism, Cultural Revolution to the current era. It took a lot of top talents from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to make the movie ""Farewell my concubine"", which brilliantly tells these transforms from the tragic story of two opera performers.
""Farewell my concubine"" is a famous story in the Chinese history. It tells that after the misrule of the Qin dynasty, two main forces rose to compete with each other for the reign. One is called Han, which is led by Liu Bang, a subtle and somewhat unfaithful man, and the other, Chu, led by the bold Xiang Yu (the King), who had peerless courage. In the decisive battle, the army of Chu was severely beaten. The King was trapped with remaining troop and little grain. The defeat was doomed. At the night, Hang's troop started to sing Chu's folk songs all around to make Chu's soldiers forgo their fighting spirit. Hearing the homeland's folk songs when the King was drinking, he sighed to his beloved concubine Yuji woefully: ""My strength can uproot mountains; my courage is peerless in the country. But the fate is not on my side; even my black steed would not run away to save its life. What should I do with you?"" Yuji danced for the King for the last time and sang in tears: ""Hang's troops have taken the field, Chu's songs are all around. As your Highness's courage is over, why should this humble concubine value her own life any more?"" The song ceased; she suddenly pulled out the King's sword and took her own life. On the following day, it came the final bout. The King, unable to accept the loss of honour, refused to cross the Great River to return to his homeland defeated. He fought to the last man and killed himself beside the river. The story of ""Farewell my concubine"" itself is just as famous as the war between Chu and Hang if not more. It has been recited again and again by generations through fictions, storytellers, operas, etc.
The movie started from 1924 in Beijing. A whore took her son (Chen Dieyi) to the opera school to ask the instructor to keep her son. But the instructor refused as the boy had six fingers on his right hand. In the cold winter, his mother chopped off the extra finger when his hands are frozen to numb. From there started the doomed tragic life of the boy. For having a feminal figure, he was trained to act female roles. In the school, Chen formed a close friendship with his senior Duan Xiaolou, who was trained to perform masculine roles. Chen had a hard time to accept being female in the opera at first. After rigorous and sometimes torturous training, he was eventually forced to admit the female role, but also became mixed up between opera and the real life.
After years, both of them became famous for the show ""Farewell my concubine"", in which Duan played the King and Chen played the concubine Yuji. But in real life, Chen was also obsessed by Duan, who had only brotherhood feeling towards him in return. Life went on well until the day Duan announced the decision to marry a whore named Juxian. Chen detested the matter for his dream of performing intimately with Duan for the whole life was ruined. He brought a real sword to Duan, telling him to perform separately in the future.
During the Japanese occupation of Beijing, Duan was arrested after a conflict with the Japanese soldiers in a performance. Juxian begged Chen to save Duan and as an exchange she would go back to the whorehouse. After being released, Duan despised Chen for performing for the Japanese. Juxian also ate her own words and kept Duan from performing again. At that time Chen's fame was at the climax. But the emptiness in his heart led him to opium.
When the old instructor came to know that the two separated, he summoned them and scolded harshly. Feeling shamed at the master's words, the two started perform together again.
After the anti-Japanese war, the lives of opera performers were no better. Once the soldiers were making passes at Chen during a performance. Duan could not stand it and the soldiers beat the performers. Pregnant Juxian lost her child in the fight and Chen was arrested for performing for the Japanese before. Duan and Juxian tried to save Chen, but disheartened Chen refused to cooperate in the court. When Duan was helpless, the court surprisingly announced the suspension of the case for a high official secretly wanted Chen to perform for him.
After the PRC was founded, during a performance for the PLA, Chen suddenly lost his voice due to overdose of opium. They apologized; expecting angry boos from the audience. But to their surprise, the PLA applauded warmly. They suddenly found that the whole world has changed overnight. Chen decided to quit opium and start a refreshed life. As they are consulted on the modern form of Beijing opera, Chen, over-obsessed by the opera, spoke out his opinions sharply on the shortcomings of the modern opera, for which he was regarded at backwardness at that time. Eventually he was dropped from the cast just before a performance, which broke the new dream he only just built up.
In the Culture Revolution, Duan was forced to confess the ""guilt"" of Chen. Stricken by the shock, Chen revealed the ""guilt"" of Juxian. Duan was again forced to admit: ""She is a whore. I don't love her."" Juxian lost all hope and hang herself in her red bridal dress.
After 11 years and the end of the 22-year separation on the stage, the two performers came back to an empty stage to perform ""Farewell my concubine"" one last time. Concubine Yuji: ""Your Highness, please confer me with the sword"". The King: ""My concubine, no, don't take your life lightly."" Chen pulled out the sword, the real blade that symbols the long relationship of the two, and ended his own tragic life in his broken dream.",1007856000,15,5911,4.679154658981749
599624,5,6303187196,"I rented ""Farewell My Concubine"" last fall after reading many positive reviews on Amazon.com and other film sites. I have always been a fan of Chinese music, especially opera, and I watch Peking Operas on TV every week. Having a whole movie revolve around the dizzying world of Peking Opera was a brilliant idea. All of the performances are astounding, especially from Leslie Cheung. Granted, Chinese Opera is an acquired taste, the feminine parts sung by males in a very nasal falsetto.
But ""Farewell My Concubine"" is more than just a musical legacy. It is a tale of friendship, loyalty, passion and betrayal on a grand scale, including the attempted destruction of Chinese Opera during the Cultural Revolution. My only complaint is the scenes of the two actors in ""present day"" China...they do not seem any older than when we first saw them as twentysomethings even though they would be forty years older. But this is an excellent movie, although long and very intense in some spots (rape, suicide, drug use). It certainly gave me new respect for Peking Opera and the sacrifices that were made in the name of music.",1006732800,15,1117,4.853403141361256
599625,5,6303187196,"Just like that movie, Farewell My Concubine takes the viewer through the roller coaster that was the 20th century. It presents a unique perspective on modern Chinese history and reminds everyone of the dramatic changes that took place as a whole (and the US thought it underwent changes???? ha!).
All that aside, the characters are far more rich and complex than that American movie, and ends in a far more dramatic way than anyone expected.
If Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the only Chinese movie you've seen, you really must do yourself a favor by seeing this film.",1005264000,3,571,4.836734693877551
599626,4,6303187196,"Chen Kaige delivers a sprawling epic that spans from 1924 to 1977 which follows the dubious, sometimes belligerent sometimes copacetic, relationship of two Beijing Opera singers as communism and political unrest infiltrates China.  It is richly photographed and impeccably acted, with more sumptuous, poignant, and emotionally strident moments than one could ask for in a dozen films (the most powerful image being the last shot of the film).  Kaige seems to achieve the almost impossible, making us care deeply for characters while still fulfilling the perfuctory obligations of creating a fastidiously rendered society.  Obviously not for everyones liking, but if you're reading this review you probably like good film-making.  A must see for anyone interested in the best foreign movies from the 90's.",998179200,3,804,5.512195121951219
599627,5,6303187196,"A story of epic proportion with extraordinary acting, breathtaking camera-work, flawless direction and excitement that never stops!  The film is a virtual Chinese ""history"" (recent) lesson of chilling proportions! But in many other ""history lesson"" films the political story gets in the way of your ""being there"": you watch instead of experiencing. In this film, you cannot escape ""being there"" for every second of the story! You experience the 3 lead characters as electrifyingly powerful archetypes: the seductive wily female who can fight and deceive but can also heal, the dominant power-driven male who knows, how to survive - albeit clumsily - in this world, and the androgyne who sees the exquisite magic and beauty of other worlds, but is dangerously vulnerable in this one.  The ideas themselves are haunting!  Can anyone forget the shocking moment when Leslie Cheung (the male ""concubine"") surrounded by flames, shrieks out in despair: ""you have all betrayed me""?! We realize the horrifying complexity of the betrayal: the country has betrayed him, the society which raised him to the height of ""stardom"" has betrayed him, friends, a lover, and even strangers have betrayed him, and - worst of all - he has betrayed himself!  The strange movement of the story carrying the characters and us through historical periods in recent Chinese history acts like the movements and counter-movements of water masses in the ocean giving us the uncomfortable feeling that everyone lives in a sea of betrayal where nothing is dependable, nothing is safe. And underlying the entire story is the principle that everyone is ""betrayed"" by the inevitability of death, and by the inevitability of change which by its very nature is our friend at one turn, and our enemy as it turns in the opposite direction.  Many scenes burn their way into your memory, but as it is with any great masterpiece, no matter how well you remember the story, you see it each time as if for the first time, totally unprepared for what will happen. I have seen the film many times, and somehow I still react with shock at the amputation of the child's finger and the brutal training of the children early on in the film. And no matter how vividly I think I can remember the ""pieta""-pose scene in which Gong Li rescues her rival by forcibly rocking him out of an opium-induced stupor, I still react with tears when I see it again. The film is filled with unforgettalbe moments which shock the soul, which somehow preserve their freshness and power whenever you revisit them. And then, there is the eerie quiet drama of the final death scene...  Underlying the masterful visual and conceptual presentation of the film is the hauntingly beautiful musical score which constantly opens the doors of your consciousness, and carries you through the film like a mighty river, moving you breathlessly and inescapably into the presence of the characters and their surroundings from the first to the last frame of the picture.  If you haven't seen this film, you have missed a great masterpiece. If you have seen it and admired it and are afraid to see what it loses in the transfer to the small screen, I can tell you that it loses nothing. The color and sound transfer are wonderful, and the film gains from the opportunity to study it and revisit its tremendous depths, again and again. And somehow, the small screen sucks you into the story as powerfully as the large one in the theater did. DON'T MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN THIS FILM!!!",996105600,12,3500,4.872268907563025
599628,3,6303187196,"I agree with the reviewers who have praised the actress Gong Li as Juxian. She was remarkable - a beautiful woman with a musical voice. I don't understand the Chinese language but I wanted to rewind the film to listen to the sound of her speech.
I do feel as if I was misled by the blurbs on the box. This is a highly violent and disturbing movie, especially in the beginning when we are witnessing severe child abuse, over and over again. It is  pointlessly sadistic and there is a lot of bare-bottomed paddling, especially with the flat of a sword. There is also a bloody incident where a wooden tool is placed in the mouth of  the transvestite character and wiggled around until he bleeds. All this because he was confused about ""boy"" and ""girl.""
I would strongly recommend that viewers keep their children out of the room for this movie. As an adult, I was bothered by the unneccesary violence. It does not mesh with what I've read about the high value placed by Chinese upon their male children.
Ironically the invading army scenes were not as violent as the acting school scenes, given that the Japanese committed such inhumane atrocities in 1930s China.  Also, it was unbelievable that the characters found a male baby left outside the city wall to die, when it reality, female infanticide is more likely.
The costumes in this film are spectacular.  And  I thought the film moved well through the various eras, first the Warlord era, then invasion by the Japanese, then the Nationalists, then the Communists.  I think it gave a good sense of the public humiliation and blacklisting done during the ""Cultural Revolution.""
I saw this film with English subtitles, which seem to aptly reflect what's going on  in most cases.  However, I don't  understand why this film won a film festival award. It is unnecessarily violent and disturbing.",993081600,4,1842,4.73125
599629,5,6303187196,"This wonderful Chinese film was nominated for several academy awards.  It is a story about Chinese opera and the cultural revolution but at another level it is about relationships.  We follow the story of two actors together since childhood and the woman who comes between them.  The cinematography is breathtaking (It should be no surprise that director Chen Kaige was originally a cinematographer). Pause the film occasionally (especially if you have a DVD) and just savour the rich colours and textures of the film. It is a gem.

599630,5,6303187196,"This is a bittersweet love saga between loyalty of friends, lovers - a real and powerful illustration of human interaction that depicts layers of hatred/love, obsession/passion to the chinese opera, setting in between the 2-4 and 7-7 communist movement upheaval. I've been a Leslie Cheung fan for 5yrs now, and naturally I view all of his films with a pair of analytical lens. He is the most fascinating character in this film. From the beginning, his sense of identity is confused. Not only is he attracted to men, but his role as a woman creates a certain ambivalence about his own gender. In childhood, the refrain soliloquy of 'I am a girl' is drilled into him so that he can effectively assume the role of the concubine in the opera; but, his self-identity blurs/entangles in the contrast between life on stage vs. real life. This is definitely a film worth watching, both epic and intimate, literal and emotional. I also loved the theme song by Leslie Cheung too, where he sings ""Wei sheh meh nee boo dong, you le ai jui you tong.(why is it that you don't understand, where there is love, there is also pain.)""",985824000,18,1116,4.67005076142132
