6781091,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Anyone who has seen a decent number of movies has seen this set-up before. This is one of the better entries into the genre.

Here's the scoop. A recently divorced mom (Melissa McCarthy) moves into a new home with her son. Their neighbor (Bill Murray) is a real piece of work. He drinks too much, smokes too much and has just impregnated a Russian stripper. But Melissa finds she needs him to babysit her boy because the demands of her job are too much. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise in that all reap the benefits of this relationship.

I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. Yes. I've been here before but I liked these characters and there were some new tricks on the old dog. First is the Murray character. He's in great form here. He seemingly has no redeeming qualities. But then who is the woman in assisted living for whom he does the laundry? And there is more than a bit of truth in how he reprimands McCarthy on the way she's raising her son. The viewer gets to watch as the layers of his onion peals away and you get to see how he came to be who he is now. This is some pretty serious stuff. The kid is great. For his first time at bat he hits it out of the park. His part was written well and he handles it well.  And the McCarthy character is good. I like her a lot and seeing her play a straight role is cool. The Naomi Watts stripper is a real hoot. She supplies the yuks and has a way of keeping Murray on a short leash.

This is just a very enjoyable flick. It moves along at an even pace, and, given the well-worn premise, still manages to dish up some surprises. When it comes to the title scene I found myself welling up. I wish the studio had given this a better push. This deserves a larger audience.",1415145600,28,1730,4.155223880597015
6781092,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Written and directed by independent film make Theordore Melfi (Winding Roads), St. Vincent is one of those films that on the one hand feels like others you've seen before but ends up engaging you in surprising ways.  This is partly due to Melfi's well-written screenplay and deft touch as a director, but is more because of the truly outstanding cast he's assembled and the top-notch performances they deliver.

Vincent MacKenna (Bill Murray in fine form) is, when you first see him, apparently the neighborhood grouch, an old retiree who drinks too much, gambles too much and generally seems to live to complain about everything that annoys him, which is seemingly everything. Like when some people move into the house next door and the movers end up accidentally damaging a tree near his driveway, causing a branch to fall on his decrepit station wagon.  When his new neighbor Maggie (Melissa McCarthy in a surprisingly subtle role), a newly divorced single mother with a 12-year-old son, comes over to see about the trouble, Vincent immediately exploits the situation, claiming damage not only to the tree but also to his car and his fence (most of which actually happened the night before when he backed into his driveway while drunk).  Which is the first time Maggie's son, Oliver (newcomer Jaeden Lieberher in a truly winning performance) sees Vincent, forming a not very welcoming impression on the boy.

Things quickly go downhill for both Maggie and Oliver as she tries to settle into her new job at a local hospital and he tries to settle into his new school.  Complications develop when some kids at school swipe Oliver's clothes (including his wallet, phone and keys) during gym class, leaving him having to walk home only to find he has no way to get into the house and no way to call his mother.  Leaving him only one recourse - he has to ask a drunk and highly grudging Vincent if he can use Vincent's phone to call his mom.  Which in turn leaves Maggie, who has to work late, no recourse but to ask Vincent if he can let Oliver stay at his place until she gets home that evening, which Vincent immediately exploits by making her agree to pay him for baby-sitting. Which leaves Vincent looking after Oliver for the afternoon, including making him a dinner of what he calls ""sushi"" - sardines on Ritz crackers.

Somewhat predictably, Vincent ends up looking after Oliver on a regular basis, mainly because he really needs the money.  But Vincent's idea of what ""looking after"" involves means taking the kid wherever he goes, including his favorite local bar, the race track where he has to keep an eye out for a bookie he owes a lot of money to, and the strip club where his regular - and quite pregnant - hooker, a Russian immigrant named Daka (Naomi Watts), works.  But Vincent also takes Oliver other places, which begin to reveal to the boy that there is more to Vincent than first met the eye.

It's really the performances that make the movie though, and the enormous chemistry that develops among all of these very disparate characters.  I can't say if any single performance is Academy Award worthy, but if there were an Academy Award for Best Ensemble Cast, St. Vincent would definitely be a contender.

Highly recommended.",1415059200,11,3246,4.752669039145908
6781093,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy in the same movie? This I've gotta see!

Written and directed by Theodore Melfi, this PG-13 comedy looks at the effects of a divorce on a young boy when his mom moves next door to a curmudgeonly drunk.

Sounds predictable, doesn't it? Well, it IS. But here is the surprise: Along the way we are treated to outstanding performances by all of the primary actors, including the little boy, AND we are entertained.

We watch:
  * Bill Murray (""The Monuments Men"") as our eponymous hero, who finds having a child next door is almost diverting, because he can have him help deliver laundry and take him to the race track.
  * Melissa McCarthy (""Identity Thief"") Maggie begins to doubt her neighbor, particularly when her son wins a schoolyard fight.
  * Naomi Watts (""The Impossible"") Daka never had a daytime job but pole dancing doesn't provide maternity leave.
  * Jaeden Lieberher (""Playing it Cool"") Oliver is caught by the class bully and has to learn how to stick up for himself. Plus he figures out what a trifecta pays and Mom is upset to learn he has been in a bar.
  * Chris O'Dowd (""Cuban Fury"") Brother Geraghty has Oliver in his classroom. This priest shows great flexibility when it comes to religions and he assigns his students interesting projects.
  * Terrence Howard (""Sabotage"") Zucko is Vincent's bookie and Vincent owes him a LOT of money.

There are many noteworthy scenes but it was nice to realize that we are allowed to figure out much of the plot on our own. Expect mild profanity, a schoolyard brawl, a drunken Vincent injuring himself and a poignant history. Our screening audience applauded.

BTW: Be sure to stay during the final credits because Murray entertains us with a garden hose and a Bob Dylan recording.",1415059200,2,1771,4.735294117647059
6781094,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Theatrical review.
Let's face it, Bill Murray is always a treat, and here he manages to take it to another level playing the irascible neighbor in New York. Vincent is an unemployed veteran of Vietnam who lives alone with his cat. He's drunk most of the time, likes to play the ponies and spends much of his free time with a pregnant Russian hooker, Daka (a nice comedic turn by Naomi Watts).

A new neighbor moves in next door. Maggie (Melissa McCarthy, playing it straight) is a single mom starting a new job at the hospital. Her wise-beyond-his-10-years son Oliver (terrific Jaeden Lieberher) becomes buddies with Vince. Vincent's initial objective is to earn babysitting money in order to play the horses, and get his bookie (Terrence Howard) off his back. The story isn't a new one and it certainly has plenty of opportunity to slip into sentimental horse crap, but director and screenwriter Theodore Melfi holds back.

Murray manages to infuse just the right amount of humor and child endangerment exploits into his character to keep the film from becoming one you've seen before. Sure the final act has some touching moments that border on mawkishness but whether or not you buy in will depend on your level of cynicism. For its faults, I loved the film and watching Bill Murray in action is always fun. Hopefully, Oscar is watching.",1415059200,,1340,4.821739130434783

6781096,4,B00P1WGHLI,"""St. Vincent"" (2014 release; 102 min.) brings the story of an aging, grumpy, alcoholic guy named Vin (played by Bill Murray), who is down on his luck (owing money left and right, etc.). It's not long before a new neighbor (played by Melissa McCarthy) moves in. Her movers accidentally cause damage to Vin's car, tree and house, causing mega-grumpiness. She introduces herself (her name is Maggie) to Vin, and we learn she herself is going through a rough period (divorce). When she needs after-school care for her 12 yr. old son Oliver, Vin agrees to it, desperately needing the money. Meanwhile Vin is also dealing with his pregnant Russian girlfriend (played by Naomi Watts), who is a ""lady of the night"". To tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut from writer-director Theodore Melfi. He probably couldn't believe his good fortune when Murray agreed to star in this. Melfi doesn't explore any groundbreaking themes, in fact we've seen this theme (grumpy older guy turns out to have a big heart with a soft spot) before in one way or another (see: latter day Clint Eastwood), but it doesn't bother me, as I am enjoying the company of these characters. Speaking of which: there are some noteworthy performances in here. Murray is ""business as usual"" rock steady. I am happy to see McCarthy in a more dramatic role without the over-the-top personality that broke her big (""Bridesmaids"") but in just a few years has become repetitive, predictable and almost a parody of herself (""The Heat"", ""Identity Thief"", ""Tammy""). Naomi Watts is almost unrecognizable as the Russian girlfriend, it looks like she had a lot of fun with this 'off-center' character (the end credits even show 2 Russian language accent coaches!). And newcomer Jaeden Lieberher as 12 yr. old Oliver is simply outstanding. Last but certainly not least, the movie contains a ton a great music, both as to the orchestral score (composed by Theodore Shapiro) and the songs appearing throughout: Tweedy gets 2 songs, including ""Everyone Hides"" as the movie opens; Bob Dylan's ""Shelter From the Storm"" plays over the end titles (while Murray sings/mumbles along, pretty funny actually), The National's ""Start A War"" plays beautifully, but best of all is when Murray dances to Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love"". But no, there is no music from musician St. Vincent. Bottom line: the first hour of the movie plays out perfectly, whereas the last 45 min. becomes a bit too predictable and sugar-coated for my taste, but I still enjoyed the movie overall.

""St. Vincent"" has been expanding gradually from a limited release to a wider audience. The evening screening where I saw this at this past weekend (in Ft. Myers) was very nicely attended, I'm happy to say, and it appears that this movie may have found good traction to stick around for a while in the theaters. If you have the chance to check out ""St. Vincent"", be it in theaters or on DVD-Blu-ray, I'd strongly encourage you to do so.",1415059200,,3077,4.881453154875717
6781097,3,B00P1WGHLI,"Despite the fact that one of the stars is a child, this is by no means a family picture. Societal standard of decency are shattered with several scenes where Bill Murray uses every known obscenity in front of the kid.

The success of the movie is only because of the kid. He acts as the anchor and keeps the plot advancing.  Murray shows the same stoicism when dramatic affect is needed as he did thirty years earlier in The Razor's Edge. Despite this, there will be much buildup to garner an Academy Award nomination for Bill. The character he portrays is given the opportunity to show a range of feelings and reactions due to misfortune that occurs to him. But Murray time and time again throws it away with his overly subtle performance.

The director fails to get much out of Murray and to keep him consistent with the character's condition. He also does a lousy job on making sure continuity is in effect when there is supposed to be some type of hint of passage of time after blood-letting incidents.

The inclusion of the Naomi Watt's prostitute character is strange and very unbelievable. Her introduction to the movie is an affront to decent tastes when she is shown sitting on top of Murray in rhythmic support of his sexual needs despite being very pregnant.

Credit, though, should be given to the producers for giving Melissa McCarthy a chance at a role that normally would go to someone with better eye candy appeal. I'm guessing part of it had to do with making sure everyone understood that the Murray character would never have romantic interest in her. Still, it should hopefully open up more roles for actors who make Kathy Bates look like Twiggy.

See this movie because of the kid and not Murray (who is also made to look very unflattering all the way through) otherwise you may be disappointed.",1414972800,,1816,4.641744548286605

6781099,4,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent is a perfectly nice, if rather pedestrian comedy-drama graced and elevated by a top-notch cast.  With only a series of relatively obscure short films to his name, it is honestly a bit of a mystery how first-time writer and director Theodore Melfi assembled such a substantial group of talent to tell his sweetly predictable story of a grumpily imbibing Vietnam veteran and the put-upon lad who defrosts his heart.  But he has, and the result is largely satisfying despite uneven pacing and competent, but bland photography.

Entirely established now as a living legend after a long and winding career of global hits and independent cult favorites, Bill Murray does much of the heavy lifting for St. Vincent without sweating or straining, infusing a circumscribed character arc (from disagreeable old bastard to hard-won generosity of spirit) with grit and vivacity.  It is a pleasure to simply see this pro do his job as well as ever, unleashing barbed one-liners with his casual mastery of exhausted deadpan.  As the Tiny Tim to his Scrooge, newcomer Jaeden Lieberher avoids the potential pitfalls of child performancehe is adorable and wide-eyed without overplaying eitherand the often boisterous Melissa McCarthy delivers a tender and dialed-down performance as his mother, aching and adrift after a foul divorce.

There are more famous names on hand still:  Naomi Watts, for instance, in at once amusing and deeply strange role of a Russian call girl and exotic dancer pregnant with what may or may not be Vincent's child.  It is interesting to see Watts play so against type, but the character is rather improbable and ill at ease with the rest of the picture.  Chris O'Dowd cannot help but be charming in the otherwise thin role of a neighborhood priest and teacher, while Terrence Howard is unpleasant and squandered as an intimidating debt collector in a bit of a grim subplot abruptly abandoned by the film without, as far as I can see, any resolution.

Overall, St. Vincent has lumps and cannot always rise above certain perfunctory instincts, but the muscular cast, particularly the spellbinding Murray and his pint-sized straight man, bring it home and justify the price of admission.",1414800000,3,2208,5.074585635359116
6781100,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I just walked out of the theater after seeing St. Vincent and I had to immediately write this review before driving home or doing anything because I thought it was so great. This was honestly one of the best movies I've seen this year.

St. Vincent focuses on Vincent (Bill Murray), a crotchety old man who's a drunk and owes money all over town. Vincent ""employs"" Daka, a pregnant prostitute played by Naomi Watts, and has new neighbors in the form of Maggie (Melissa McCarthy), a hardworking single mom, and her son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher). When Oliver locks himself out of the house one day after school, he stays at Vincent's house until his mom gets home from work. Vincent is able to ferret this into a gig babysitting Oliver regularly after school while Maggie is at work. Vincent is a horrible influence, taking Oliver to bars and the race track and teaching him how to fight. Even though Vincent's character is so gruff and basically a lowlife, he's actually pretty lovable.  Throughout the course of the movie, we get to discover that there's a bit more to Vincent than meets the eye, and he's not so bad, deep down inside.

While this movie was classified by most as a comedy, I would probably go so far as to call it a dramedy, even though I hate the term. It was pretty funny, but also had some touching and real moments, with more substance than a straight comedy typically has. The first half of the movie was hilarious, with me laughing hysterically at Murray's dark sense of humor and the inappropriateness of his character. Then for the last part of the movie, things became a bit more serious, and I was trying to keep from shedding a tear here and there. However, there were still plenty of funny parts to ease the tension and provide comic relief.

The acting in this movie was great, in my opinion. Vincent was cast perfectly, with Bill Murray being the perfect amount of snarky and rude while still being likable. Lieberher was a cute, yet sarcastic little kid, and I loved watching Oliver and Vincent's budding friendship. Naomi Watts was hilarious as the Russian beauty Daka. Chris O'Dowd played a priest at Oliver's school (probably the coolest priest I've ever met..), and his Bridesmaid costar Melissa McCarthy went in a totally different direction than I've seen her in lately. McCarthy's last few roles have been disappointing to me, as I feel like she's been typecast as the over-the-top, funny fat lady, when she's so much more than that. Her character here had more depth and reminded me that she can act, although I feel like this role didn't allow her to showcase how funny she can be when she doesn't have to be stuck in the same gruff dirtball role (because let's face it, while she was hilarious in Bridesmaids, she essentially was the same character in Identity Thief, The Heat, and Tammy).

Overall, a really touching, really funny movie.",1414713600,230,2880,4.683794466403162

In fact, it wasn't even all that original, but rather the fantastic chemistry between veteran Bill Murray, and newcomer Jaeden Lieberher made all the difference. After a bitter divorce, Maggie & Oliver have been forced to move to a new neighborhood, where they find their new neighbor is a bitter old drunk named Vincent (Murray). Vincent wants nothing to do with anyone, until happenstance throws him together with Oliver, who he reluctantly agrees to watch in exchange for a paycheck, but what does he know about taking care of a kid? Even though this movie could have been more raunchy, Bill Murray is always funny and paired together with this scrawny, innocent, overprotected kid, made for some of the best interplay I've seen in a very long time. Murray was at the top of his game, but he almost had the show stolen right out from under him by young Jaeden Lieberher. Four years later, we know this kid is a star, and after seeing this performance, it's easy to see how he landing huge roles in the movies It and The Book of Henry. Finally the cast is rounded out by Melissa McCarthy who I honestly can not stand anymore, but believe it or not, she was very reserved and laid back. I didn't know she was actually capable of doing that. St. Vincent won't win any awards for originality, some parts could be a bit slow, although there were a few surprises.

6781228,3,B00P1WGHLI,"This was a good movie.  I originally wanted to see it as it had Melissa McCarthy in it who I enjoy.  This was more of a serious dramatic role for her and I was pleasantly surprised to see that she can do drama and not just slapstick hilarious screwball comedies like Jim Carrey.  Bill Murray was also incredible as well as Naomi Watts playing a Russian lady of the night.  The movie primarily surrounds Bill Murray who is a former vet, but now just an angry curmudgeon who has extreme distaste for people.  However, within that grouchiness he has heart and makes moves and choices that would cause one to do a double take.  You realize he's not just an interesting mean old man.  The other characters in the movie around him notice this too, which is why they stick around.  Melissa McCarthy plays Bill Murray's neighbor.  She moves in next store with her young son.  She's a single mother going through a divorce due to her husbands constant infidelities.  Overall, I enjoyed this, but probably wouldn't watch it again.  While it had a great story with interesting characters and some moving moments, I found the movie dragged quite a bit in places where it wasn't bad or good, but was just blah and bland.  It would wrap me back in when some interesting moments popped up here and there.  It finally picks up in the last half hour when everything unravels.",1481500800,,1358,4.5578512396694215

It is wonderful!  Unfortunately, the actual movie has problems.  Bill Murray was hilarious in scenes with everyone BUT Melissa McCarthy.

In many ways, this kind of movie illustrates the sad state of where we have come as a society, as we find ourselves cheering for a seriously flawed character who is ultimately celebrated as a saint. Gone are the days of heroes that have virtue, courage, and impeccable moral character. Now we celebrate mediocrity and even failure. Apart from the empty nihilistic nature of the movie, it was still reasonably well done, and it will generate some emotions.

6781327,5,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent, starring Bill Murray as Vincent, asks us to define the qualities of a saint, while we enjoy the decidedly unsaintly Vincent.
He defines curmudgeon, a cranky old misanthrope unhappy with his life and ready to dress down practically anyone who talks to him. The film itself is an amusing character study with unanticipated turns.
But don't think you can write the script because Vincent and the motley crew of his life have surprises that do not fit the usual bitter old guy formula. The saving grace is the honesty Murray invests in the role, which requires him also to display caring characteristics not immediately apparent. That we are probably spying into the eccentric character of Bill Murray through Vincent is an added treat.
The catalyst for the clichd curmudgeon turnaround is a new pre-teen next door neighbor, Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher), who is thrust on Vincent for after school babysitting by med-tech mom, Maggie (Melissa McCarthy). While the bonding is to be expected, Vincent and Oliver do a long dance before any saintly traits emerge. Yet Oliver learns what saints don't ordinarily do, like fight and gamble. As we learn, those aren't necessarily negatives.
Although Naomi Watts' Russian hooker is a bit over the top in beauty and heart of gold categories, she manages to project a simple love for Vincent, a symbol for everyone who loves Vincent even as rough as he is. Although Vincent could be loved for only his Vietnam experience, he does low-key, un-Mother -Teresa-like acts of kindness that could qualify him for sainthood.
That's the important theme of this tragicomedy: Being good, loved, and saintly are within the grasp of the most common among us, implying that imperfection is a constant of being human and maybe a bigger credential than piety when that sinfulness is transformed into good deeds.
St. Vincent is an entertaining film with a well-worn message, but Bill Murray, in his finest role since Lost in Translation, transforms it into holiness.",1474243200,,1993,5.042424242424242

6781342,5,B00P1WGHLI,What a wonderful inspiring movie. I love indie movies because they showed the best talent and I have never seen Bill Murray is a better role. It's too bad he does not get the credit he deserves because he's done some fabulous indie  movies and he really does a good job with playing many different types of characters. I just love this movie and I believe they should show it in school to every seventh grader . It would be a great opening to a lesson on finding the best in our neighbors and friends.,1473292800,,501,4.273684210526316

Through a child with  no preconceptions, can you really see the man he really is.  I felt an over all good feeling after watching this flick.

We selected this for family movie night and it was a bit mature for young teens.  That said, the dialog was fantastic, and the adults watching laughed at many of the exchanges and every actor was impressive and convincing. The end is touching, but predictable, and things slow about 3/4 of the way in, but there was a lot less preaching than you might expect in a movie about a little Bing Saint.

6781451,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I loved this movie. I don't want to describe the plot and all the things that can bring the viewer to tears about the characters. I do wish I could recapture that time in my youth (I went to Catholic school) when believing there are saints around us felt natural because it was part of education. I had forgotten this.

Today, there are attempts to elevate people and make them heroes - often to further a political agenda (for example). Public relations has never had such a field day with morals. There may be saints around us who don't act like saints, don't fit the description of saints, and yet deserve some kind of sainthood (maybe the two-star level sainthood, and sometimes the full-blown four-star level sainthood.) .  You know that St. Vincent is going to be Bill Murray in this story. The saints who don't find recognition will continue to be saints, quietly. It makes you wonder if you know someone like that in your own life.",1463356800,,939,4.583333333333333

6781567,5,B00P1WGHLI,"this review refers to - as usual here - to the original version with subtitles.

as already mentioned here several times, the outstanding performance of Bill Murray is simply irresistible. In my opinion this is his best performance to date! It doesn't feel like acting - it feels, he is living his part!
Completely surprised I am by the very ""quiet"" and restrained representation of m. mccarthy - very good.
The big Naomi Watts, ranking world number 1 movie-actress, at first I did not even recognize. She enacts the Russian whore-with-a-big-heart just so convincingly, as I expect it from the number one. Wow!
The role of the boy is cast really good too.

The story itself is pretty predictable and it happens nothing really surprising plotwise.
For me, the boy acts sometimes a little too grown-up in some scenes, given his young age.
Slightly exaggerated - but of course so typically American - I finally experienced the enormously tear-jerking speech at the end.
But hey, so be it, cos the great performances of the cast more than make up for these minor shortcomings of the script (or was it the producers?)

Conclusion: a very nice little writer-director-film by Theo Melfi with outstanding performers...

cheers, >>>>> the notwister - Rating = 85%, (so 5 stars, but closely)

The characters represent people we all know, with all their good points and bad. I won't review all plot details, there are many other reviews that give satisfactory descriptions. Bill Murray was quite an adorable man who drove people crazy at the same time.  A man with many bad habits, the viewers learned that even he had many good qualities. Melissa McCarthy played a divorced mother of a son who had to deal with the common problems of raising a son while she had to work, and how to deal with babysitting issues. Naomi Watts was excellent playing a Russian ""lady of the night"", a friend of Bill Murray who helps him through difficult times.  Her accent was very good, in fact I didn't even know it was Naomi Watts until the end of the film, and she is one of my favorite actresses.  That really surprised me.

6781614,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I have a penchant for a good indie movie: films with humanity, skipping all the trappings of Hollyweird's ""prim and proper-ing.""  Movies that feel authentic, with sincere humor and emotionally charged, believable drama; where seasoned actors are pushed beyond their limits and typecasting into a realm of raw originality.  It is a rare thing to find any cinematic experience that meets such criteria but there are a few that come dangerously close.  With that said, brand spanking new director, Theodore Melfi, takes a big risk with two big names and crafts an amazing story that gives me renewed hope that quality work still exists out there in Tinsel Town.  Despite some improbable plot points and the detestable ideas that all heroes must be reduced to the lowliest state for us to be able to relate to them and no one is truly the ""bad guy,"" the overall tone, feel, and impact of this flick is remarkable.  The three leads; Murray, McCarthy and, the young, Lieberher bring a finely contrived script to gloriously depressive and yet surprisingly hopeful life.  And I just realized what a wonderfully artful actress McCarthy is when she is not spewing relentless f-bombs or partaking in incessantly nonsensical ""Stooges"" like slapstick.  She is both endearing and warmly funny.  Murray does the impossible for such an iconic comedian; he successfully and quite masterfully separates himself from his irrefutable imagery to deliver, what I think, is the performance of his recent career.  But it is Lieberher who steals every scene he is in, not because of his convincingly charming naivet but his genuineness and absolute dedication to his role.  The remaining cast is equally impressive no matter how brief their time is on screen.  This is what indie films should be; an amply told tale, rich with credible characters that truly connect with the audience while avoiding all the precociousness and pretentiousness that is annoyingly common in this genre.  Thank God for small miracles and St Vincent is one I am truly grateful for.",1451865600,,2034,5.038805970149253

6781620,2,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent's basic premise - a cranky old man's reluctant friendship with a precocious young boy - was done far better in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kolya/dp/B007HJ8M16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kolya</a>, which had a political setting that gave it a depth that this film cannot match. The real problem is that St. Vincent is utterly predictable.

***SPOILERS***

The film begins with Bill Murray's title character, who is presented on what appears to be the penultimate stage of a spiral into alcoholism, penury, and despair. We soon meet Melissa McCarthy, who at least takes a break in this film from her typical role as the crazy loser fat lady typified by the depressing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tammy/dp/B00OH8QSHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tammy</a>. Here, she's the ""world's least-involved mom,"" and while the father's character has maybe one line, and is mostly presented through statements made by her and her son, played by Jaeden Lieberher (and you thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quvenzhan-Wallis/dp/B00ABD0M54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quvenzhan Wallis</a>&nbsp;had a funny name), the viewer is left wondering if the kid wouldn't be better off with dad, who at least is capable of picking him up from school.

Murray's character, unwillingly roped into babysitting a kid who is probably mature enough to be a babysitter himself, gradually warms to his role as father figure and wise old man, teaching his charge how to break an attacker's nose, drink, and gamble (although the kid is better at picking horses than the old man is). We learn that Vincent has a heart of gold, paying to keep his wife, who no longer recognizes him, in a top-notch nursing home while he subsists on sardines. There's a huge plot hole, where Vincent has a stroke, which lands him in rehab for what must be a few months, while the loan sharks who were about to beat him to death and the nursing home that was on the verge of turning his wife out into the street, both conveniently forget that he owes them money.

The ending, which reveals Vincent as a real-life saint, is a manipulative tear-jerker on par with the worst Hollywood has to offer. While the credits roll, there's an odd scene of Vincent watering a dead plant, the dirt, and his feet while singing along to Dylan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter-from-the-Storm/dp/B00137STFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter from the Storm</a>. I can only assume that this was put in at Murray's request (""OK, Mr. Murray, how about you get to do whatever you want during the end credits"").

Maudlin and predictable, with profanity that places it off-limits to the kind of people who love ""maudlin and predictable,"" this steaming pant-load is recommended only for die-hard Bill Murray fans (or Melissa McCarthy fans, or Naomi Watts fans who want to see her play a foul-mouthed, unattractive Russian prostitute), or for those committed to seeing every film ever made.",1451520000,,3109,5.794310722100657

Bill Murray is wonderful and the fact that he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this movie is inconceivable. His character Vin is flawed and unlikable, but you start to see something else as the film progresses. Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts are terrific, but the real charmer is the young son Oliver of Melissa McCarthy's character, played by Jaeden Lieberher. This young actor is remarkable and he will warm your heart. Bill Murray has been a favorite of mine since his days on Saturday Night Live, but some of his more recent films have not impressed me so that is why I avoided this film at first, but I can only tell you that I am so glad that I decided to try it.

She's a very talented, funny and beautiful woman and I feel her size is treated with unnecessary disrespect.  Plenty of talented male actors equal or better in size than her (although none are in THIS movie) are not treated in the same manner.  And very often the male actor's size is a costume which comes off to reveal a thin person as part of the happy ending.  Hollywood needs to stop already.  Granted, women actors take on these characters but that is their chosen profession and if they want to work, I'm guessing they view these less than flattering roles as a necessary evil.  However this movie and many others, I feel, could be done in a less hurtful manner without hindering the plot of the movie.  It's time to stop assaulting the public, particularly the female public, with this insult.",1449100800,,956,4.648809523809524

6781673,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Any time I see the film with Bill Murray, I have to check it out.  This one also includes impressive supporting actresses Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts.  Story is set in Brooklyn and it is a sort of ""coming of age"" movie.  Melissa McCarthy plays a newly divorced woman with young son.  She is working long hours trying to make her ends meet so she can pay the rent and have tuition for her young boy.  Although, young boy Oliver is Jewish he goes to a private Catholic school.

As Oliver's mother is putting a long hours working at the hospital, it is a matter of circumstances and convenience that next door neighbor played by Bill Murray (Vincent) ends up baby sitting the young boy. To a young boy, Vincent is somewhat of a surrogate father and a role model; to Vincent on the other hand, young Oliver is ""$11/hour"" (his babysitting rate for a young kid).

Naomi Watts plays Russian call girl/exotic dancer/Vincent's occasional date who happens to be pregnant.  In her neck of the woods, that is not exactly what customers are looking for, so all these characters begin to merge together - unwillingly at first but by the need of the movie they are kind of surrogate family everyone would wish to have.

I enjoyed this movie a lot.  All actors gave wonderful performances.  And no matter what age one is, this is one of those fabulous movies that goes to show audiences, that most often than not, things are never what they seem.  there is always more to every story and every person. Only most of the time, it takes an open heart of a young and pure child, to bring the truth and the whole story to the surface.",1446768000,,1618,4.465986394557823

6781707,1,B00P1WGHLI,"Probably the worst movie I have ever seen when I give the themes consideration.  Vincent is portrayed as some sort of saint who tends to his ailing wife and then befriends a disadvantged kid going through divorce while at the same time he has trouble holding a job, drinking too much, gambling and managing money.  Really?  How can he be so good and so bad at the same time?  He's so faithful he pays a hooker who he has a great relationship with, the beautiful Naomi Watts.  All those in favor of portraying prostitution as The Most Honest Profession will love this movie.  Is Watt's character also slightly confilicted?  She works for discount with a single John whom she has a real relationship with and ends up having a child.  That's realistic.  The mother character is close to consistent in portraying herself as overburdened under suppported and never around and resentful of a father's involvement, not to mention out of shape and overweight.  I just don't see where the redeeming qualities and interesting believable plot line would be.  The writers are confused and unable to smoothly blend human fault and fraility with honest script.  If you want a realistic look at how the dichotomy can be explored I'd recommend Big Night.  Still not sure what the point of the movie is but I suspect someone was intent on bashing men and fathers.",1444608000,,1346,4.75

All thorns aside, I don't see how this could be perceived as anything short of a triumph for all those involved. Murray playing a character made to loath, McCartney playing a clean-cut type of character for a change...acting, directing, cinematography, etc, all on point. This is that film that is as stylish as it is welcoming. I could watch it with my mom who likes heartwarming tales, with my dad who hates artsy hand-held shots, or in a college class for intellectual analysis. I can count on one hand the movies that made me tear-up, and this one really got me! It's smart & touching, in a way that is modest and inviting for all types of audiences.

6781720,5,B00P1WGHLI,"""St. Vincent"" starring Bill Murray is funny, sweet, and well-written. Murray is absolute perfection as Vincent. He should've received an Oscar nomination for this film. Murray proves he's more than just a deadpan kind of actor. He shows incredible range, and a killer Brooklyn accent as the grumpy but lovable Vincent. Vincent never does anything in small doses. He drinks too much, smokes too much, gambles too much, and is too self-involved when it comes to other people's needs. Vincent strikes up an unlikely friendship with his new neighbor's son, Oliver. Vincent teaches Oliver many vital life lessons along the way, even if his intentions aren't always seen as redeemable. I also want to give props to newcomer, Jaeden Lieberher who plays small but mighty, Oliver. That little kid nails every scene he is in. He's effortless chemistry with Murray is quite remarkable. Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actress' and she's almost unrecognizable as Daka, Vincent's pregnant ""lady of the night"" friend. She also has a killer accent, hers being Russian. I even like Melissa McCarthy in this film who plays Oliver's overworked/overstressed mother. I appreciate McCarthy toning down her over-the-top comedic side. Sometimes less is more and she really shines as single mom, Maggie. ""St. Vincent"" has a wonderful balance of sarcasm and heart. The ending might make you tear up a bit. I wouldn't recommend this movie for young children, but I definitely like the message of this movie. The power of family and friendship are what is most important in life. Bravo to Murray for taking on such a challenging role and to the writer/director, Theodore Melfi for creating a delightful and meaningful film. I highly recommend it.

6781729,4,B00P1WGHLI,"St, Vincent stars Bill Murray as an acerbic old guy with a sort-of heart of gold... he excels at this type of role and is weirdly funny throughout.  Naomi Watts plays a strange role as a pregnant strip-club dancer with a heavy Russian accent, and Melissa McCarthy plays it mostly straight as a single Mom trying to make a go of it (although she does have some very funny lines).  Chris O'Dowd as Brother Garaghty (a teacher in a parochial school) is a hoot.  Overall, this good-natured movie has some funny moments (I enjoyed it) but it wasn't stellar. The plot is a bit contrived and predictable, but does include a few twists.  If you like Bill Murray and his brand of humor, you'll enjoy it.",1443571200,,694,4.484126984126984

6781764,5,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent is a masterpiece of a movie for the way it slowly shifts from comedy into drama and eventually sadness near the end (and WOW are the final 20 minutes sad to me, and inspirational and amazingly moving too).  It's about a mother (Melissa McCarthy) and her young son who move next door to Bill Murray's house.  After a moving van predicament that results in the van smacking a tree branch that falls on Bill's car and messes it up, Bill demands that Melissa pay for the damage.  Now I'm used to Melissa being more outspoken, boisterous or angry based on other roles she's famous for *ahem* Tammy *ahem!*.  Here she's *very* calm, shy and totally reasonable.  I'm... stunned!  I wasn't expecting this character, haha.  Anyway she doesn't mind paying for the damage.  She's even vulnerable and lets Bill walk all over her more often than not.

Anyway it turns out Melissa's young son (Jaeden Lieberher) gets picked on at school by bullies.  He attends an interesting discussion class where all the kids have different religious beliefs which I find fascinating.  I wonder if such classes really exist?  If so, genius idea!  Such a class teaches children to be tolerant and respectful of all religions.  Anyway Bill's basically a grumpy old man because nothing goes right for him.  That is until this kid enters his life.  When the kid returns home from school one day and doesn't have his house keys to walk through the front door because the bullies took them, Bill finds himself babysitting the boy even though he hates doing it.  At first he flat out despises it.  Bill's grumpy personality persists the entire first half.  He even demands that Melissa pay 12 dollars an hour for watching her son, haha.  Anyway Bill teaches Melissa's son how to stand up and defend himself (with successful results!  Check out how a simple game of dodge ball can go horribly wrong!  I guess that's what happens when you throw a ball too hard!)

What I find odd is when Naomi Watts comes into the picture.  She's a Russian prostitute (and speaks Russian remarkably well).  What a very strange role for her character!  Naomi constantly stars in movies that are diverse and different (King Kong to Funny Games anyone?) but to portray a smutty woman?  And what's funny is when the kid doesn't understand what she does for a living, and she doesn't want to come out and say it either.  ""Woman of the night?  What's that?""  Well truthfully I had no idea what that meant myself until a few years ago!  I thought it was just a very good Uriah Heep song about a mysterious woman who comes out at night and casts spells on people.  Nope!  Anyway what was Naomi doing here?  She seemed totally out of place.  I don't think it was ever explained other than Bill likes wild women from foreign countries.  Can't blame a man there (sorry!)  At least she shows a compassionate side.  Love her believable portrayal of a Russian accent.

Anyway this film gets serious when Bill finds himself needing urgent medical attention.  You see Bill gets involved with the wrong people (such as Terrence Howard) and needs to cough up some quick money.  But when he doesn't pay up, unpleasant people show up to his doorstep and make him pay.  Bill also visits his wife in a retirement home which could've used more backstory so we could find out why she was there.  Personally she was the wrong woman for the role because she looked much healthier than Bill.  Anyway this movie is really good.  I suppose I'm feeling sadness unintentionally (other than a certain speech moment that involves Jaeden- what a well-written moment that was!)  I'm looking at Bill, noticing he's getting older while listening to Bob Dylan's ""Shelter From the Storm"", and well... perhaps because the song itself is sad and the fact we grow old is even sadder, I got caught up in the moment.

Tremendous acting serves this simple story well.  It's simple and yet, so powerful.  There's several real messages underneath the writing too.

6781765,4,B00P1WGHLI,"I found St. Vincent a well-done, original, and quirky dark comedy. Murray continues his successful string of more ""mature"" darker-type characters who have ""lost their way"" a bit (which probably began with his mid-1990's Wes Anderson roles).  It's not necessarily lots of ""laugh-out-loud"" low-brow laughs (though you will laugh out loud!), but rather has the feel of bleaker comedy with characters whose lives are a bit out of sorts... It has a lot of great dialogue and plenty of ""good lines"" (sometimes humorous, sometimes inspiring); as well as semi-ludicrous moments and a rather melancholy mystery/back-story...
This might be my favorite ""post-80's"" Bill Murray flick besides ""Rushmore"" (which I still consider a total comedy classic.).

Overall great comedic cast- I particularly found Naomi Watts convincing as the ""pregnant, Russian, call-girl.""",1442102400,,852,5.596899224806202
6781766,4,B00P1WGHLI,"I didn't buy this movie but found it at the library.  I remember reading some tepid reviews about it, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  The story is a good one and believable although somewhat exaggerated with all the eccentric characters involved.

Bill Murray is Vincent, a guy who is down on his luck, drinks heavily, spends a lot of time at the racetracks, and is in danger of losing his home as his reverse mortgage has reversed into red ink!  I might add that he also has more pleasurable hours with Daka, played by Naomi Watts----a pregnant stripper, ""lady of the evening"" who just wants to earn enough money to ""go on maternity leave!""  This role is well done down to the Eastern European accent and adds a comic relief to the rest of the movie.

Melissa McCarthy  is a newly divorced mom with a young son who has moved next door to Vincent.  This role for McCarthy is not the comedic ones we usually see her do.  It's serious and she struggles to work at a job with long hours so her son can attend a private Catholic school.  She's new, doesn't have afterschool care for her son, so Vincent with some prodding and a high cash hourly rate agrees to mind Oliver.

Here's where the plot gets going.  Oliver is a slight, rather precocious young man who initially gets picked on and Vincent soon teaches him to stand up to the resident bully.  He also accompanies Vincent to the race tracks and even a dive bar and gets introduced to Daka.  Oliver soon finds out more about Vincent and learns that there is more to this curmudgeon than meets the eye.  He truly cares for others and this is evident in frequent visits to a nursing home.  His past also stays with him because he was of the era when young men fought in an unpopular war.

The setting of this story is in Brooklyn, in a very modest neighborhood.  The people featured seem very real---even the kids in the school.  It's one of those movies that make you want to cry and also laugh.  It shows that life can be unfair but sometimes you get lucky depending upon the people you meet!",1442102400,,2068,4.377952755905512

For me, this movie was unexpectedly and surprisingly good, fantastic in fact. I am always pleasantly surprised when I love a (serious) Bill Murray film.

6781831,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Not everybody from what some sociologist I read one time has called the generation of 68, those who came of political age in the 1960s and who went off to war, or didnt, smoked dope, or didnt, had a good professional career, or didnt, raised a family, or didnt, and so on, is of the generation of 68 (those who tried to storm heaven to create the newer world that one way or another was driving them forward until the ebbtide came and washed a lot of it away). A few, no, a lot of people, guys and gals alike, went about their lives in the 1960s very much like they had expected to (and their parents expected them to except do a little better) as if the whole SDS/anti-war/merry prankster/on the road/yellow brick road school bus/drug/acid rock/commune and whatever you wish to add slashes to was from another planet. And that place, more or less, is where the titular head of the movie under review, Saint Vincent, played by the curmudgeony (if there is such a word) Bill Murray who has made a career out of playing the holy goof curmudgeon to a tee (and still wears that mantle well) landed when the ebb tide of the 1960s hit.

Yeah old Vincent is a curmudgeon, no question, of unknown resources, a gambler, drinker, doper, crank crackpot but see this plotline is strictly under the feel good cinematic experience category so something has to give. And of course it does. See the big built-up of the cranky old guy who hates and/or complains about everything (although in a shrug your shoulders kind of way also a Murray trade-mark) gradually gets broken down by, well, a kid, a kid who moves in next door, the son of a single mom who has to work like seven dervishes to make enough dough to keep them afloat. And so Vincent transforms from that old curmudgeon to the saint baby-sitter of the title-kind of-while the kid learns a few things about life. But mainly about how to break down an old guy and make him a good guy. Not an easy task in this wicked old world. If you are looking for a big message story forget it but if you are happy with an hour and half or so of Bill Murray doing his Bill Murray thing then-take the ticket, take the ride.",1440547200,,2151,4.3775

6781885,3,B00P1WGHLI,"Definitely not a comedy, and many parts of the film just make you cringe.  Bill Murray's character is too inconsistent to be believable.  I can believe a saintly man being crotchety, a drinker and an occasional gambler -- but insisting that Melissa McCarthy's financially struggling character pay him for a fence he knew he demolished himself? Or stealing prescription medications and selling them to a drug dealer so casually, like he did it with no conscience whatsoever?  I've lived with deeply flawed human beings who felt they had to be ""cruel to be kind"" but they were never as inconsistent as this guy, and when it's all said and done, I would never label them ""saints"" even though they were capable (at times) of being genuinely selfless..

Just glad I did not watch this with my kids.  I agree with other reviewers that the best part of the film is Bill Murray's mumbled singing at the end during the credits.  THAT part was realistic and made me chuckle.",1439251200,,964,4.708333333333333

I took it for granted from the trailers and the fact it starred Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy that it was a comedy--on the order of Stripes and Identity Theft.

6781906,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray is as charming and witty as ever, with his trademark humor coming through in waves. Melissa McCarthy is an incredibly talented actress, bringing a human side to the humor. Naomi Watts was a surprise to me, as I did not know she was in the picture until the credits rolled.

Pros:
-Hilarious at moments, touching at others
-All star cast

Cons:
-Bill Murray seems to inhabit the same persona as in previous films (may be a positive thing for many viewers)

I don't believe this will be McCarthy or Murray's trademark performance, but it certainly will not be a sore sight. Definitely recommended.",1439078400,,607,4.761904761904762

6781940,5,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent is a comedy about an awkward relationship between a young boy and a misanthropic. It stars Bill Murray together with Melissa McCarthy,Naomi Watts and Jaeden Lieberher.

This film directed by Theodore Melfi centers on the relationship between a 12-year old Oliver,who is forced to be left into care by his mom going through a divorce to their new neighbor Vincent,a retired Vietnam War vet who is penchant for alcohol and gambling. The two develop an improbable friendship and Oliver gets to go with him in his daily routine such as the race track,the strip club and the nursing home where his wife is staying. In the process,he also gets to meet Vincent's pregnant stripper friend,Daka. In the process,Oliver and Vincent help them grow to become better individuals. Oliver learns to become a man and to defend himself against school bullies. Meanwhile,Vincent realize that he indeed has a good heart despite his situation in life and his dislike for others is brought about by the sufferings he has experienced in life.

No question that Vincent is portrayed excellently by Bill Murray. His charisma and comedic talent brings a lot into the character that he is portraying. It was a delight to watch him from beginning to end. The screenplay was also good as we get to see a young boy learn many things from someone set by society as a bad example or better yet considered to be outcasts of society. It was one film that a person will learn not to judge others no matter what their situation in life is and realize to be more understanding of others just like Oliver,who nominated Vincent into Sainthood in their school project. A touching movie indeed.",1438819200,,1665,4.818181818181818

Bill Murray, Naomi Watts (the hooker with a heart of gold), Melissa McCarthy (wonderful as the boy's mother) and the rest of the cast are right on target!  Now for the real star of this movie Jaeden Lieberher.  That is such an unfortunate name as it will be hard to remember when he gets to be the star he has to become.

6782049,4,B00P1WGHLI,"First time I've seen Melissa Mc give a mostly subtle performance so that was a nice change.  The shabby grouch who is really a guy with a heart of gold premise made it a little formulaic.  I think this is done deliberately to make us like the character but I understand that in books/film we have to care about the main character.  Few people want to spend time watching a total jerk in action.  Watts character is kooky but pretty gross but if you don't take her pregnancy too seriously, it can be considered ""funny"" by some.  The fact that a mother leaves her son with a stranger is also a bit difficult to accept but we are made to believe pretty early on that the man next door is ""safe"".  So, a bit unrealistic but if you are just looking for a chuckle, you could do worse.",1437436800,,778,4.222972972972973

Jaeden Liberther was perfect as his 12-year-old sidekick, Melissa McCarthy showed her chops in a straight role as the mother of the boy, and Naomi Watts stretched herself to play a visibly pregnant Russian pole-dancer.

6782342,5,B00P1WGHLI,I really loved it. I have enjoyed Bill Murray's performances since Saturday Night Live days. The movie was true to life in so many ways and dealt with serious topics on a humorous level. Plenty of belly laughs,1434931200,,209,4.526315789473684

The new kid in the neighborhood doesn't have friends, and the big slob befriends him and protects him. The big guy is also obnoxious, has hidden secrets, and is a loner. Murray pulled it off; McCarthy was great in a waaay toned-down role for her. I'd recommend if you want something cerebral.",1434499200,,423,4.367088607594937

6782378,5,B00P1WGHLI,"As a Chiver, I am biased in regards to Mr Murray and his excellence.  But I as biased well before that.  I grew up on Ghostbusters and Groundhogs Day and other classics.  This is a step beyond anything he has ever done.  His performance is brilliantly nuanced as to show the character in full scope.

And he isn't alone.  Melissa McCarthy flexes her muscles beyond just silly comedy and gives a gutwrenchingly honest performance that, knowing many single mothers, felt very real to me.

Naomi Watts was outstanding as well.  It took me a few minutes to realize it was her.  She actually plays a very good foil to Murray's equally unsympathetic role.

Jaeden Lieberher definitely made his mark on the industry.  He reminded me of Anton Yelchin in House of D ( A MUST see).  Not in his performance, but in his presence.  He will definitely be a force to be reckoned with.  He held his own opposite Bill Murray, and that is no easy task

All my stars",1434499200,,947,4.488235294117647

6782384,2,B00P1WGHLI,This was an ok movie.  The little boy in the movie is a great actor.  It was a little long and predictable.  I would not want my 13 year old watching this.  I think  the content is adult.  Ok for  a rainy day.,1434412800,,209,3.7209302325581395

I am a big fan of hers and think she is incredibly funny without all the ""F"" words which seem to consumer some of her movies. The young man who portrays Oliver is amazing. This is a great storyline which has way more heart tugs than I was expecting. Naomi Watt's character is a hoot.

Please note:  There are graphic sex scenes, so if you see it with your teens, prepare them and yourself!  There is a prostitute, foul language...  And yet, behind all the superficial, a young boy discovers the measure of the man he chooses to name St. Vincent!

If only, each person alive could be as insightful into the hidden goodness of themselves and those they meet, we would have a much happier, loving, peace-filled world!",1434067200,,755,4.776923076923077

The film opens with all the characters having their challenges in life and coping the best they can. When Murray meets Melissa McCarthy, all their lives begin to change. Murray ends up babysitting for McCarthy's put upon son and their scenes together are the among the best of the film. Very touching and very funny. Chris O'Dowd is funny as the priest at St. Patrick School and I love his Irish accent.

I rented the DVD from RedBox and wanted to see it again. When I saw Amazon had this for .99 I had to rent it here. Really funny, memorable film. You'll want to see it more than once. I loved the ending. I highly recommend it.",1434067200,,767,4.478571428571429

6782772,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I think the PG-13 rating is pretty spot on. There is a lot of swearing, drunkenness, a sex scene without nudity but leaves little to the imagination, a strip club scene, scenes in nursing homes and hospitals, at least one character dies, there is fighting and blood, gambling on horses, a child custody courtroom scene, and a minor dancing in a bar.

Now - with all of the potentially disturbing or offensive things out of the way - the core of this movie is about an aging alcoholic who is deeply in debt to both his bookie and the nursing home his wife is in, and the unlikely friendship he has with a neighbor's kid who he ""babysits"" after school. If you want to pull your teenage kids eyes away from their phones and video games, take them to this movie. It is ultimately a movie about being unselfish.

6782794,5,B00P1WGHLI,Bill Murray is always brilliant. This is another spectacular performance. He engages you in the life of his character. In the real world you'd probably have nothing to do with him. Another complicated grouchy yet tender complex character. The supporting cast is all star as well. It's very much worth the rental.,1433289600,,312,5.019230769230769

6782796,4,B00P1WGHLI,"""St. Vincent"" was a very good movie to watch.  The entire cast was very impressive, particularly Bill Murray.  Near the end, the story turned into a bit of a tear-jerker and became somewhat predictable, but not to an extreme.  (You'll see it coming.) Mr. Murray's character in the film was typical of a kind of role that has suited this actor several times in the past, so it seems.  But no matter, he does it so well.  I found the depiction of so many characters involved with the plot to be hectic at first, but admittedly, the variety of well-acted personalities inserted a lot of humor and interest in this film.  And several characterizations ran against stereotypes, such as the loan-shark enforcer, the Russian dancer, and the young boy's mother.  At 99 cents, this viewing was a steal!",1433289600,,793,4.702898550724638

6782836,5,B00P1WGHLI,"This movie was so good, I don't even know how to describe it. I can say that this is probably Bill Murray's best role ever, & I mean hands down! The dynamic between him & the little boy is priceless.  Melissa McCarthy plays a mom that moves to Brooklyn after a divorce with her young son.  She ultimately has to pay her crass gambling, drinking, strip club frequenting neighbor (Bill Murray) to watch her son in the afternoons after school.  Their odd relationship is heart warming.  The little boy ends up seeing the good in this mean aweful man that no one else can.  And another pleasant surprise:  Naomi Watts performance as a pregnant Russian stripper who also has a strange but almost heart warming relationship with Vincent as well is fantastic.  I've only ever seen her in more serious roles, so this was a refreshing and almost comedic risk she took.  But it paid off.  All of the characters together make this movie a hilarious yet touching pick that I highly recommend to anyone!  (A word to the wise though; this movie is definitely not appropriate for children, so watch at night after bedtime!)",1432944000,,1108,4.635897435897436

6782950,5,B00P1WGHLI,"This is easily Bill Murray's best performance for a few decades.  Jaeden Lieberher who plays the young boy in the movie also does an excellent job.  Even Melissa McCarthy in the minor screen time role of the boy's mother does a pretty good job and it's refreshing to see her not playing the same old bullying, foul mouthed aggressive character she usually plays.  Naomi Watts  also does a nice portrayal as a pregnant Russian prostitute, Chris O Dowd also does a good job as the boy's teacher.

If you're unfamiliar with the plot, this is basically your standard grumpy old man neighbour where a new child neighbour gives him the time of day by forcing himself into his life, and shows the world there's a reason he's like this, and once you get to know this grumpy old man has a lot of great qualities.  The plot has done constantly before by Hollywood, Gran Torino, Denise the Menace, and a chain of Modern Family episodes when Luke was younger, would be your most famous ones.  St Vincent though retells the story well, and hits the mark where it needs to, if you're an emotional movie watcher you'll probably reach the tissues when the story takes you there.

6783002,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Lots of positives on this film: anti-bullying, recognizing people for who they are, importance of role models especially the male role model. I also liked how initially the divorced dad character was the bad guy but his kid still loves him. Gets pretty old having the divorced dad be the bad guy in films lately.  Bill Murray did the right thing by accepting this movie role. He humanizes the people of the world who are entirely unbearable, showing that everyone has a reason for being who and how they are. You can see the moment, several times, when his character magically justifies horrendous behavior and, while you don't entirely agree, you kind of want to give him a hug, probably because you're not the one suffering the consequences of said behavior. Some vulgarity, suggestive language. Impressive performance by Bill Murray during the scenes where he suffers an injury.

While I thought this was an excellent, thought-provoking movie, I definitely wouldn't recommend it for families with children. The basic premise of this movie is that people who on the surface seem to be unlovable might actually be proven by their dutiful actions toward others to be much better than it originally seemed. This could be very confusing, though, to children. For example, the main character drinks, uses profanity, is rude, gambles, and sleeps with a pregnant prostitute -- not things you want your kids to emulate. I don't want to spoil the whole movie for you, so I won't tell you the good that he does, but it is heart-warming.  For me, however, I was able to see this movie as a way to see human value in others that we might at first dismiss. It helped me to see that God created everyone for a purpose and that each one is gifted in a special way to help the others around him. Each life is worth living and honoring.  This movie is thought-provoking. . It would be an excellent movie to talk through with teenagers or with an adult group. Personally, I think this movie would be very valuable for discussion purposes,",1431907200,,2022,4.735795454545454

6783006,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray is wonderful as an ornery old man with a well-hidden heart of gold in this excellent story about the relationship between a man and his unexpected protege'.  With superb supporting performances by Melissa McCarthy, Naomi Watts, and Jaeden Lieberher, Murray gives yet another nuanced and genuine reading of a man who's rendered emotionally closed off by his wife's illness, drinking, gambling and other poor life decisions.  ST. VINCENT is not unlike Eastwood's GRAN TORINO, but Murray steals the show.  A bit of a cloying and ham-fisted emotional ending, but it doesn't detract from an otherwise excellent comedy-drama. 4 stars for the movie and 5 stars for Murray.",1431907200,,677,5.192660550458716
6783007,3,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent is a pretty average film, bolstered by a strong cast but hampered by a weak script and a dopey and formulaic third act. There's enough here to make the film watchable, but it's probably best to go in with modest expectations.

BillMurray stars as Vincent MacKenna, a crabby Vietnam veteran who drinks, smokes, and relies heavily on the services of Russian prostitute Daka (Naomi Watts, in an unusually bad performance). Watts is a terrific actress in films like Mulholland Drive and Birdman and shes generally reliable for a good performance, but I imagine her preparing for this film by spending hours watching Boris & Natasha. It's just terrible. There are times when it's enjoyable in a campy sense, but mostly it's cringe-worthy.

Not entirely dissimilarly, Terence Howard plays the world's least menacing loanshark, and this is yet another example of how the screenplay to this film is hugely predictable and formulaic, filled with contrivances and clichs. The titular character suffers from similarly so-so development. Vincent is a misanthropic curmudgeon, but beneath his mean exterior, there just may be a soft side, after all. (Spoiler alert: there is.)

Vincent befriends a young boy named Oliver, the son of his neighbor Maggie (played by Melissa McCarthy, in a pretty good performance as a single mother), and there is a sort of About a Boy or Million Dollar Baby vibe to their relationship: he grows to need the kid, and the kid grows to need him. Oliver is unpopular at school, but with his new father figure, he may or may not learn the necessary tools to stand up to bullies, and Vincent may or may not teach him how to fight to a Green Day cover of I Fought the Law. Beneath his crude sensibilities, does this jerk have a sentimental side? Stay tuned to find out.

Much of this film is deeply cynical and is going for a Bad Santafeel but its just not on that level, and when it tries to go sentimental at the end, it feels forced, awkward, and disingenuous. The film critic Gene Siskel often judged films by asking, Is this movie more interesting than a documentary about the same actors having lunch?, and I believe the answer here may very well be no, but I also do not want to damn this film too harshly. It wants to be a great film and does not succeed, but it is also consistently watchable. I would liken it to Jesse Peretzs 2011 film, Our Idiot Brother, a film with a very generic and sitcom-y script that warrants a watch based on the strong cast (Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, etc.). This is not really essential viewing, but fans of Bill Murray could probably do worse.

It is telling that the films best scene may be the very last one, which simply features Bill Murrays character listening (and singing along) to Bob Dylans Shelter From the Storm as he sits and smokes in his backyard. Its a great song, and Murrays mumbled accompaniment is hilarious, and scenes like these do help to compensate for some of the films numerous deficits.",1431907200,2,2993,4.7041984732824424

6783012,4,B00P1WGHLI,"I had always imagined that Bill Murray could be entertaining even if he was just watering a plant. His new film St. Vincent ultimately confirms my assumption but not before offering one of the most satisfying experiences at the movies this year.

St. Vincent is the story of Vincent MacKenna (Bill Murray), a selfish, filthy, cranky curmudgeon of a guy living alone in his Brooklyn home. However when Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) and her son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) move in next door, Vinces deliberately isolated existence is suddenly shattered. With Maggies job as a CAT scan tech requiring late hours, she must, in an act of desperation, lean on the dissolute Vincent to watch Oliver after school. Olivers new school is a religious prep academy that is uncharacteristically non-denominational. And while the school is universally accepting, the students are less so making it hard for Oliver to make friends even with Brother Geraghtys (Chris ODowd) lessons about sainthood and brotherly love. Thus, Oliver looks to Vincent for guidance, and what follows is a well-executed, though familiar, tale of unlikely friendship. Think Up with most of the Disney rinsed off.

Selfish adults paired up with circumstantially victimized children is a staple of American cinema, and that fact could have easily stacked the odds against St. Vincent; however, the charm, heart, and most of all performances in this film prevent it from falling victim to the clichs and mediocrity that this genre is capable of producing. Writer/Director Theodore Melfis screenplay does not meander or wander away from its strengths, the principal of which is Murray. Murrays turn as the crotchety Vincent is as fine a performance as hes ever delivered and certainly the most sentimental. Yet, the film earns every laugh and every tear without setting foot into melodramatic or schmaltzy territory. While the screenplay does enjoy the occasional shortcut or coincidental predictableness, the larger motif about the existence of unconventional goodness in the world is quite successful. Newcomer Lieberhers performance as Oliver is also very good allowing Murrays character to feel that much more dynamic. McCarthy is great opposite Murray and Naomi Watts is surprisingly well cast as Vincents lady (of the night) friend, Daka.

St. Vincent is less a comedy than the trailers would have you believe. While occasionally funny, this film tugs at the heartstrings as hard as any drama ever dares. Still, genre-based confusion aside, the film works and delivers on a wide range of emotions that may help get Murray his first Oscar. A-

You can relate to all of the characters, as each one is struggling quite a bit.  Unless you are rich--then you've never known any of these people.

What is beautiful is the power of unity that this movie presents.  The fact that we need each other--even when we think we hate each other.

This movie was a big surprise.  It's a worthwhile movie with emotionally effective parts and enough comedy relief.

Good story.  Watch it.",1431820800,,569,4.61

Lots of positives on this film:  anti-bullying, recognizing people for who they are, importance of role models especially the male role model.  I also liked how initially the divorced dad character was the bad guy but his kid still loves him.  Gets pretty old having the divorced dad be the bad guy in films lately.

Some vulgarity, suggestive language.  Impressive performance by Bill Murray during the scenes where he suffers an injury.  Overall really enjoyed the film.  Would have given it 5 stars but seemed over edited as stated.",1431475200,,787,4.63768115942029
6783069,3,B00P1WGHLI,"The movie is uneven.  At times, the film seems to be veering toward comedy.  At others, it quizzically veers toward the tragic.  Bill Murray seems a bit confused about the character he is playing.  It is a bit of a schizophrenic performance.  The character he plays, a down on his luck mope, really never fully materializes as a fleshed out person.  It is like Murray was told to play two separate and distinct parts in the same movie.  He goes from crotchety old drunk, to a caring, selfless person taking care of a boy and a sick wife.  You never really see how this one character can be both people.  It is a confused performance that is not his best.  Melissa McCarthy plays a recently single mom of a precocious boy.  She is toned down from her usual blustery self, but she also comes across as a bit phony.  You are really never sure what her motivation is.  Naomi Watts plays a pregnant prostitute with a heart of gold.  Although certainly a shameless contrivance, she at least has a feel for her character and stays consistent throughout the movie.  It seems like a movie whose director could not figure out what he ultimately wanted.  The ending is heart warming and bad at the same time.  This was a decent watch, but not something to go out of your way to see.  There is some swearing, but nothing over the top.  No nudity or scenes too adult for younger teens.  Perhaps the ultimate o.k. movie.",1431475200,,1406,4.460629921259843

He humanizes the people of the world who are entirely unbearable, showing that everyone has a reason for being who and how they are. You can see the moment, several times, when his character magically justifies horrendous behavior and, while you don't entirely agree, you kind of want to give him a hug, probably because you're not the one suffering the consequences of said behavior. You don't know what's going to happen in the story, but I can predict that, at some point, you're going to suddenly get something in your throat. It's going to feel a little itchy. Soon after it's going to feel like lemons are being squeezed into your eyes. Is the pollen count high? Is this an allergy fit? No. No. You've just been Murrayed. I'm sorry.

6783099,5,B00P1WGHLI,"While I thought this was an excellent, thought-provoking movie, I definitely wouldn't recommend it for families with children.  The basic premise of this movie is that people who on the surface seem to be unlovable might actually be proven by their dutiful actions toward others to be much better than it originally seemed.  This could be very confusing, though, to children.  For example, the main character drinks, uses profanity, is rude, gambles, and sleeps with a pregnant prostitute -- not things you want your kids to emulate.  I don't want to spoil the whole movie for you, so I won't tell you the good that he does, but it is heart-warming.

To Christians including Catholics, by our definition, the main character is not a saint.  This movie is secular and salvation by faith in Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice offered as grace to sinners is never discussed in this movie.  For me, however, I was able to see this movie as not a tutorial on salvation but as a way to see human value in others that we might at first dismiss.  It helped me to see that God created everyone for a purpose and that each one is gifted in a special way to help the others around him.  Each life is worth living and honoring.

I already mentioned that this movie is thought-provoking.  I guess this is also synonymous with controversial.  It would be an excellent movie to talk through with teenagers or with an adult group.  Personally, I think this movie would be very valuable for discussion purposes.  Let me reiterate, though, it is certainly NOT for children.",1431302400,,1559,4.6838235294117645

6783108,3,B00P1WGHLI,"This is a sweet little movie with a very predictable story.  Alot of reviews i read were very positive,which is completly fine,however for the seasoned movie goer this story will seemed overly contrived and over done.  But,that doesn't make it bad or a wasted 90min of movie watching.

Bill Murray plays an all too familiar old crumugeon who is drinking and gambling his senior years away.  He is alone in a dump of a once well kept house that is obviously missing one of it's members.  When he is not drinking,gambling or both he is having scheduled weekly visits fron a Russian ""lady of the nite"",played by Naomi Watts in a very odd overly contrived written character that exits nowhere except in these feel good movies reminicent of day gone by.

Enter Mc Carthy and her little boy..About 3rd grade.  Very well preformed by some cute kid.  They move in next store and engage Murray as an unlikely babysitter.  McCarthy is a divorced mom and working doubles and Murray needs the $$$,so...they inspite of dislikely each other ,kinda,enter into again this very contrived arrangement.

From there we have,once again,one overly contrived scene after another,but not unwatchable,just the opposite,until we as expected see this 3rd grader see the good man (with a backround story so contrived..right,you get the idea)behind the crumudgeon that he picks him as the character in a school assignment asking him to pick a living saint.  Why Murray is anything close to saintly is anyones guess,but between the prostitute with a heart,friends that drink too much with him and his nursng home bound wife,he is  again contrived to fit the bill..

So,as expected we have the scene at the end of the movie with the kid reading his SA,written at college level,while an unexpecting Murray is tricked into hearing it,just in time for those so inclined to take out their hankys.

Not my kind of movie...but,this will appeal to many people and for good reason.  Most movies are contrived and while this one is like mediocre disney fair from the 60's it works,i'm sure just how the people involved in making it wanted it to.  Don't let my facetious review keep you away,if you like these movies.  ""It is what it is""...and that is a direct quote from the movie itself.",1431216000,2,2248,4.827676240208877

6783129,4,B00P1WGHLI,"The movie ST. VINCENT (2014) has been rated PG-13 for its crude ""language"" and non-nude simulated sex scenes ... BUT it is really a VERY SWEET, FUNNY, & THOROUGHLY NICE FILM that the whole family can enjoy together!

It has a very skilled, highly likable ensemble cast and a fairly good script (with maybe just 2 jarring plot holes). Bill Murray, a long-time favorite of mine, plays Vincent, the title character--a lonely man in his late 60s with a dying, demented wife and serious money problems. Naomi Watts plays his young pregnant stripper friend-with-special-discount-benefits; Melissa McCarthy plays his going-through-divorce new neighbor, who has a 12-year-old nerdy son that's quite small for his age; Terrence Howard plays a loan-shark with a moderately kind heart; and Chris O'Dowd plays a young Irish-American teacher-priest who has a great sense of humor and a huge amount of compassion.

Every member of the cast does a wonderful job, and young Jaeden Lieberher--as the small nerdy son of Melissa McCarthy--is TOTALLY EXCELLENT! In the final fifteen minutes he virtually steals the movie from all of the adult actors. Very SWEET ENDING (3 hankies!).

AND, along the way in dozens of scenes, living with Vincent-Bill Murray, there's a wonderful white Persian cat that's VERY friendly with people! Truly an Oscar-worthy, amazing bit of acting on this cat's part!

As for the plot holes, let me just say that many excellent movies, plays, novels, and short stories contain them. Sophocles' OEDIPUS REX does, and Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE does, and Melville's MOBY-DICK does, and Twain's HUCKLEBERRY FINN does  ... but one difference between first-rate writers and all the rest is that first-rate writers find ways to hide the weaknesses while putting the strong parts into the foreground. (Sophocles ""hid"" the implausible plot elements in the PAST ... they've already taken place years before the play begins, and we audience members only get them second-hand, buffered ... as stuff that's merely mentioned by people who are DOING believable OTHER things right before our eyes.)

Such is not always the case with ST. VINCENT. Luckily, however, the jarring implausible events--which are necessary to form plot-bridges from Point-L to Point-N ... and from Point-R to Point-T--are NOT so close to the conclusion of the film that they're still in the forefront of our minds at that crucial culminating time.

Weighing the many genuine strengths of this film with its very few weaknesses, in my judgment it's a very worthy ""B+"" piece of work!",1431043200,,2544,5.175182481751825
6783130,5,B00P1WGHLI,"excellent movie.  This would be a great movie for families.  There is some swearing but it is addressed in a healthy way in the film.

This was an endearing movie about redemption, confidence, relationships, tragedy and loss,the greater good, friendhip....in fact, there is so much depth to this movie that it manages to overcome its only flaw (from my perspective), which was a distinct lack of real highs and lows. The movie is constant throughout. There are funny moments, and I defy anybody not to have a tear in their eye when Vincents Sainthood is ""revealed"",

Bill Murray was on point in this movie. He really is a superb actor, and it's in full display here. Melissa McCarthy was somewhat subdued in this movie, but the was really a supporting character rather than the star. Naomi Watts was great in her role. Nate Corrdry as a priest was pretty hilarious and perfect. All that said, I think the boy who played Oliver really stole the show. Jaeden Lieberher is going to be a star for sure. The kid can act.

anyway, I'm not going to spoil the story for anybody, but I thought it was a movie that anybody can relate to. It touches on so many aspects of society and life in general that you would have to be a pretty cold person to not relate to something in this movie. I would absolutely add this to your watchlist.",1430611200,,1349,4.409638554216867

6783227,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I was surprised by this one.  I expected Melissa McCarthy to be where most of her films have her, raunchy and making fun of her.  She was an absolute gem in this.  She was not the foil of the movie, she was the rock and the source of several emotional appeals.  Bill Murray seems like he ""phoning it in"" a little until you realize that is simply his character and how he progresses.  I didn't expect it be a little emotional at times, but that just made the whole movie even better.  I'd buy it.",1430352000,,495,4.157894736842105

It is basically about a mother getting a divorce who moves into a house with an obnoxious neighbor, kind of grumpy on a very dysfunctional level like  Mr. George from Dennis the Menace - A grumpy, inappropriate, lonely guy with a big heart. And a mother who feels the need to depend on him for a baby sitter but is mad when he teaches her son inappropriate things, but learns a lesson from him.",1430006400,,533,4.174757281553398

6783285,5,B00P1WGHLI,"This is a dark comedy not slapstick and all the actors knock this one out of the park. One of BFM's greatest performances, yes at parts you'll hate him and think he's an ass then you realize he's a saint but unlike Disney movies our saints don't wear their halo in every aspect of life. The movie is about life so don't expect fat Tammy or Groundhog Day this is more along the lines of Forrest Gump or the Truman Show. I can see why this would be a hard sell in the theaters. There is comedy, sorrow, and in the end a feeling of family. Absolutely wonderful movie if you don't go in with the wrong expectations.",1430006400,,611,4.186440677966102

I actually think that he gave one of his best performances in this movie that I have ever seen. The film reminded me of Bad Santa meets about a boy. Its very good, well acted by the entire cast. I love Melissa McCarthy, she is amazing. It was odd to see her not go over the top like she has done in the majority of her other films. I really hope that they all got a ton of awards for this movie!",1430006400,,526,3.925233644859813
6783287,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Wow. My wife and I loved this movie.
Both of us coming from lower (Catholic) middle class NYC likely helped make more of a connection for us- all the characters and situations being familiar; scary bus riding to and from school, bullies, and the gems of people sprinkled all along those city paths, those hero's and Saints, who though deeply flawed have a sweet humanity beneath their hard shells.
Even with several streaming interruptions from local thunderstorms last night we muscled through them to finish this movie that was a fine blend of Bill's special humor, fine acting from all the main characters, a great story and message, and a fun revisit to the struggles of city life we left behind years ago.
In disclosure- I'm contrasting this with the previous nights experience when we both fell asleep during The House of Flying Daggers, a beautifully filmed vivid flat tedious epic that left me with deep  feelings of regret similar to having eaten far too much delicious empty caloric cake.

6783312,5,B00P1WGHLI,"You can never go wrong with a comedy starting Bill Murray.  What's more, Naomi Watts plays a pregnant Russian prostitute here with a very believable accent.  The film also starts in small episode roles Terrance Howard as a gangster and Chris O'Dowd as teacher/priest.  Bill Murray plays Vincent, an Irish-American, Vietnam-War veteran whose wife suffers from amnesia-like-sickness and lives in nursing home.  Vincent whenever he can visits his wife to do her laundry and take care of her.  If he is not doing that, he can be found at horse racing track losing money he does not have while betting on horses, or getting himself drunk unconscious, or paying his favorite Russian prostitute for sex.  Vincent is grumpy, quirky and he does not like people.  One day, new neighbors (single mom with a clever young boy) move into a house next to Vincent's, which eventually leads to funny and life-learning new experiences both for Vincent and the new neighbors...

Bill Murray as Vincent closely resembles Charles Bukowski's real life persona in his later years,

The film also has a good soundtrack (Jefferson Airplane and Bob Dylan)...the only movie in comparison to St. Vincent (2014) that comes to my mind is About Schmidt (2002).",1429833600,,1229,5.014778325123153

I guess there are no more original ideas in the world, but must these same old tropes be manufactured so efficiently and so very very predictably? Like the work of Spielberg, this is a ""Hallmark Card"" movie that manipulates its audience's feelings with predictable cliches backed by dishonest, tear-jerking symphonics. The actors barely redeem the proceedings (tho indeed, they do)...  Who green-lights these multi-million dollar, calorie-free soap-ettes? Oh yeah: ""sounds like a winner"" accountants looking at a projected bottom line.
  I realize actors, directors, writers, etc need to pay their bills. But they should each be reminded of the schlockmeister's memorable quote before beginning: ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the screen."" Right Steve??",1429574400,5,906,5.550724637681159

In my opinion, this is the best performance by Bill Murray that comes to mind. The interaction of all the characters is clearly defined. There are comedic events, but also touching, insightful events in these developing characters. I enjoyed watching as these characters and their interactions blossomed.

6783506,4,B00P1WGHLI,"You probably know St. Vincent stars Bill Murray as a crotchety next-door neighbor who, out of mutual financial necessities, ends up watching Melissa McCarthys son after school until she gets home from her job.  So with a cast and plot like that, it has already pegged itself as a would-be heartwarming comedy.  Does it succeed?

Ive read that Murray was a pretty shrewd businessman (unlike many entertainers who make the big-time) and doesnt really have to do another movie in his life if he doesnt want to.  So he doesnt appear that often, and if he does, its because he likes the script and the part.

First indication this movie might be better than my somewhat-low expectations was that, in the initial portion, the funniest character was neither Murray nor McCarthy (though admittedly, both of them are really funny at times), but the Catholic teacher at a Catholic school McCarthy has enrolled her son in so he can get a decent education.  Chris O'Dowd was consistently scene-stealing and quietly hilarious, perhaps in part because he didn't have to carry the weight of any back-story, like the two main adult characters did.  The story is mainly seen from the viewpoint of the kid, who comes off as more mature than his age would suggest.  Although the film did not break new ground in cinema, it was well-done, both entertaining and (since I hate the word heartwarming) lets just say it was genuinely serious at times.  It maintained my interest all the way to the end.  Murray and McCarthy are both known stars, the kid also did great, but kudos to the teacher for such a great performance in a supporting role.",1428796800,,1620,4.753571428571429
6783507,5,B00P1WGHLI,This is a great movie and Bill Murray is excellent in it! One of his best roles ever!  We would have enjoyed it more if it weren't for the 25 minute download problem right in the middle of it.  Kind of ruined the story having to re-boot our roku box and wait and wait for it to load again. In fact almost every movie we rent from Amazon has some sort of hang up anymore. For all the money Amazon makes they should really invest in some better servers!  We may be looking else where for movie sources.,1428796800,,500,4.081632653061225

After seeing this, I think it's pretty obvious what's the case here. The role of Vincent in ST. VINCENT is a fairly plum role that plays to Murray's strengths as a comedic/dramatic actor. Beyond that, the film is fairly predictable in the directions the plot takes, and just a wee bit maudlin. Still, the performances were generally good (save one), and there was enough consistent laughs for me to say I legitimately enjoyed myself. The basic plot is that Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) and her son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) move in next door to Vincent (Bill Murray). Since Maggie works at a hospital and has long hours, Vincent starts looking after Oliver when he comes home from school. However, Vincent is also a curmudgeonly old man who smokes, drinks, gambles and hangs around a prostitute...and Oliver is exposed to most of this. Oliver is also a rather small kid who has trouble fending for himself at his new school. The way the narrative is set up is akin to stacking a deck of cards. If it might tug on the heartstrings then it happens, and every major cast member learns something valuable. The end. To call this film formulaic would be an understatement, yet the charming cast sells it like it's the next big indie gem (which it kind of is, at times). Far and away, the best performance is given by Bill Murray who, in a way, is quite unlikeable, but once you find more about him becomes less so. I also liked how Melissa McCarthy plays against the type she's built for herself, and is more restrained and personable compared to Bill Murray's character. I even liked the child actor who plays Oliver, although there were a few moments that didn't quite work for me. The only cast member who had me scratching my head was Naomi Watts as a Russian prostitute. She had this horribly stereotypical accent and was of little consequence to the plot, except maybe to add another ray of light to Vincent's halo, so to speak. Even though she had a few funny moments, most of her scenes felt like padding. Of course, one thing that does need to be addressed is where the film ultimately ends up, and despite the borderline saccharine plot developments preceding it, the conclusion of the film was well-done and touching in its own way. Overall, ST. VINCENT is a perfectly decent film that is inoffensive and quite funny at times, largely thanks to Bill Murray. It doesn't win any points for originality, but it makes a good time-passer.",1428624000,3,2642,4.683870967741935

Billy Murray's character, Vincent, was well played and has accurately portrayed some of the real life individuals that I have known that have experienced war, especially the Vietnam War and the struggles they have encountered when returning home.

6783719,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I always wanted to see this movie based on previews from TV while it was out in theaters. VERY cute movie. McCarthy kind of plays the funnyman too much in her other movies, to the point where she isn't that funny..she's a good straight man to Murray. Not really a comedy...to me more of a drama. I would have liked my Grandson to see the movie but there's one sketchy sex scene....he's 8...told my husband we will fast forward and let him see :)",1427932800,,445,4.309523809523809

Anyway, this movie felt as if it purposely took pieces of typical pop movies and threw them together into a ""new"" movie.

Bill Murray played the crotchety, salacious, broke old man (""Vincent"") so well that I was able to forget Melissa McCarthy and the Aussie Ms. Watts who butchered the accent of a destitute Russian prostitute to the point of distraction. Jaeden Lieberher, who played the young boy who befriends Vincent despite the old man's irascible nature, had a near flawless performance and potentially has a promising career ahead.",1427760000,,650,4.864864864864865

Vincent's down-and- outer routine is suddenly broken as a devorcee and her young son happen to move next door and Vincent is propelled into the role of babysitter. Bill Murray's Vincent and his young charge go the rounds from strip joints, race track, and meeting ""a lady of the night"" , we discover that Vincent is no simple drunk;, no simple looser.

 Grumpy, old man who becomes softened (just a little bit) as the movie goes on. Check.

 Puny kid, bullied at school, learns to fight from the old man. Befriends the beat-up bully. Check.
 Auditorium at end of movie, with every important character present, to hear the teary-eyed speech from the kid. Check.
 An ending that will leave you crying, then smiling. Check.

But I still liked it. Just because you can see the strings doesn't mean the puppet show is ruined. Give it a watch. Bill Murray is fun. On a Friday night after a long work-week, predictable and fun is just fine for me. It's not going to change the way you think of movies or comedies, but I trust it will entertain you.

Naomi is more relaxed and down to earth than I've ever seen hermaybe it was fun working with comedians?  The kid was a natural.  Not an original plot, see Hugh Grant, About a Boy, but the characters are multi-dimensional and the great performances make the piece stand out, rather than the individuals.

6784013,4,B00P1WGHLI,This movie was an enjoyable watch! Quite a funny role for Bill Murry who pulled it off beautifully.  Plenty of heartfelt moments and a surprisingly non- comedic role for  Mccarthy. Mccarthy to a back seat role in this movie to the two main characters which were her 12 yr old son and the unruly old man who lived next door. It was enjoyable to see Mccarthy shine in a different role so different from the ones she has become famous for. She has such talent.  Great plot. Highly recommend for adults only. Not appropriate for kids. Some sex  scenes/inuendo(opening scene shocker) and nudity and vulgar language.,1427068800,,610,4.726415094339623

6784021,3,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray is, of course, great once again. In fact the whole cast is excellent. And for a good while this is a funny, sharp-witted, bittersweet movie. But about midway through it begins to tilt much farther into the sweet than the bitter, and by the extremely predictable end it's just too corny and sappy and sentimental for its own good. The writer/director even sacrifices an entire sub-plot (with a fine cameo by Terrence Howard) to keep the ending upbeat. Too bad -- it could have been a very good movie, and it's merely an okay one. But watch the final credits, where Murray does a brilliant extended pantomime that says pretty much everything about his character the entire preceding movie did. He makes putting up with the movie's weaknesses pretty darn easy.",1426982400,,769,4.7894736842105265

6784040,5,B00P1WGHLI,"This was an absolutley exceptional film!

Bill Murray, one of the funniest people ever, and Melissa McCarthy, well on her way to that sort of title, deliver in dramatic rolls outside their comfort zones.

Both of them shine in this dark comedy.

Murray captivates as one of the toughest characters to play. He is a horrible person (outwardly) who draws your affection as an anti-hero. It is very difficult to sell a viewer on am anti-hero. Bill Murray nails it!

The end result of everything is a film that makes the viewer really care about Murray's character in an afirming and very uplifting way.

It does have adult language, but you soon get over it and realize that it is part of the point.  The movie will make you laugh out loud and cry while conveying the message not to ""judge a book by the cover"" (I apologize for the cliche).  Also, for those who screen movies for non-pc language, give this movie a chance.  The few times non-pc terms are used, it is pointed out that this is not nice or acceptable; thus creating a teaching moment.",1426896000,,540,4.38

6784058,3,B00P1WGHLI,"This says it's a ""hilarious comedy"". That's very, very misleading. It's not very funny though there are cute moments and the script produced a few witty lines. It's a feel good movie that probably would play better if they didn't sell it as ""hilarious"". I was wanting hilarious this evening. It was a little like taking a sip of a soda and finding it was flat. The acting was good and saved it if that's enough for you. The script is merely fair, and more than a little clich. It's one of those stories where people start off with problems and through placid, and far-fetched interaction help each other process it out and bond. Young kids would probably like it since to them it would probably be fresh. It's very safe for all viewers. There's not a mean bone in it, everybody's good at heart. And that should tell you there was no mystery and very little tension either. But you could invite any of these characters into your home despite their types.",1426809600,6,953,4.514450867052023

I've never been a McCarthy fan and still aren't, so maybe this is jading my view of the movie. This movie doesn't tell anything new, doesn't do anything new, and doesn't change anything that I can think of along the predictable path. Still, the characters are well developed I think and their personalities seem to be solid. So, you can depend on them to react certain ways to events that unfold, and that can be assuring and maybe a too boring if it is carried to far. It is entertaining though and worth the watch. There's for sure one thing I did enjoy and that was watching Naomi Watts play her role! Wonderful!

It turned out to not be a hilarious comedy at all.  All of the comedy parts were in the trailer.  It turned out to be a struggling single mom fighting for custody fof her son in need of a babysitter.  She goes with the only choice at the time....her neighbor.

6784217,2,B00P1WGHLI,This is a relatively enjoyable movie but there are many loose ends and the writing and/or editing is noticeably flawed. The relcationship between Bill Murray and his young co-star is poorly developed. Murray goes from being this grouchy old guy who hates everyone to becoming the kid's best friend. Not sure why we are introduced to Murray's wife who has Alzheimer's or Melissa McCarthy's deadbeat husband because these characters are not developed in the movie and we feel no emotional connection to them. Terrence Howard who plays a thug about to murder Murray and mysteriously drops out of the story line.,1426464000,,608,5.02970297029703

6784258,5,B00P1WGHLI,"They must have written this script forty years ago and kept it in mothballs until Bill Murray was old enough to play Vincent McKenna because this character fits the sly old Irish dog like a well worn suit.  I went into this film with a few misconceptions firstly that this was a comedy.  Yes there are sporadic jokes and the occasional funny bit but this film for the most part is poignantly dramatic.  The scenes of Vincent with his wife who has early stage Alzheimer's disease in the convalescent home will break your heart.  Secondly, curmudgeonly Vincent is a creature of habit who doesn't change his spots rather it's those around him who are effected by his presence.  Terrific ensemble the best being Naomi Watts as a brassy pregnant Russian hooker and young Jaeden Lieberher as the shy youngster Vincent takes under his wing for better or for worse.  I usually damn with faint praise juvenile actors by stating that they are unaffected and natural but Lieberher gives an admirable turn reminiscent of a young Haley Joel Osment  and more than holds his own with Murray.  This film satisfies from first frame until last.  If you don't believe me consider the closing credits where Murray lays in a beach chair lip synching Bob Dylan's ""Shelter From the Storm"".  In lesser hands this would be the equivalent of reading the telephone book but Murray is brilliant.",1426377600,3,1367,4.778723404255319

There are alot of good lessons in this movie.  Such as ""Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover""
and It's Not What On The Outside That Counts and even reminds me of a Bible verse that ""we have angels around us that we don't know""  This movie is by far the best of Murray and McCarthy.  I promise you this movie will not only make you laugh but will put a little cry in your eye !

6784268,5,B00P1WGHLI,These stars are for Bill Murray's excellent performance certainly worthy of an Academy Award. The movie is worth watching for his performance alone. We watched it with a group aged 13 through 73 and everyone loved it. Some great laughs and some touching moments.,1426291200,,262,4.9772727272727275

6784270,2,B00P1WGHLI,"Not much humor, Naomi Watts character is just annoying and contrived.  Same for the teacher. Actor who plays the kid is very good. Bill Murray, as usual, is flawless but the script is boring. Same for MMc.  The school ceremony near the end was like something written by a high schooler.

6784273,5,B00P1WGHLI,"This movie fooled me. I thought it would be a typical Bill Murray comedy. It is, but it is so much more. A serious look at life..real life and real problems. I didn't think this movie would make me cry but it did. It also made me laugh. I think this is one of Bill Murrays best serious rolls. It shows what a great actor he is. In fact it shows what great actors they all were. A beautiful movie.",1426291200,,396,3.9625

Nice to see Melissa McCarthy not be so manically comic, she has some chops she could build up - she can be funny but she can be overkill when it's all that and nothing but. She's learning and growing as an actress though, I can tell.",1426032000,,347,4.4375

6784347,3,B00P1WGHLI,"Amazing acting, fantastic cast, original story - but darkly sad in many elements.  The boy steals the show; Naomi Watts' character provides much humor, and it is refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy in a serious acting role, as opposed to just distasteful comedy.  Bill Murray is his best-ever character in this complex role, as both the somewhat scandalous and irreverent neighbor, but in the end, also a man with a bigger heart than expected.",1426032000,,442,4.95945945945946

6784358,4,B00P1WGHLI,"We loved this movie.  Bill Murray's character is a little rough around the edges, but he has been through a lot in his life.  He's full of surprises and befriends a new neighbor boy whose parents are going through a divorce.  Melissa McCarthy shows another side of her acting abilities in a serious role as the child's mother.  When Vincent befriends a pregnant prostitute, it was a little chaotic, but funny too.  The boy surprises all in the end, but  of course I won't spoil it for you.  He was great and very believable in his role, which was an extensive part of the movie.

6784423,5,B00P1WGHLI,If you like Bill Murray than you have to see this. It incorporates all of the Murray quirks. The story isn't as great as Groundhog Day. It's a real to life story that breaks down some stereotypical barriers while dealing with a potpourri of an extended family. The ending is reminiscent somewhat of Caddy Shack. In the middle there are many of the problems of average people's lives depicted. This is a film that one may want to see again.,1425945600,,439,4.5

There is a sex scene beween Bill Murray and his ""lady of the night"" played by by Naomi Watts that is in the beginning of the movie...it's nothing graphic but enough to make it not a great movie to watch with kids of a certain age just yet.  I absolutely loved the story.  I hated to love Bill Murray's character but by the end you really learned to love the jerk.  Kind of like in ""Groundhog Day"".",1425945600,,418,4.1234567901234565
6784430,4,B00P1WGHLI,Bill Murray makes me watch a movie to start with. This is somewhere between three and four stars. He is better served by more subtle roles. This is quite a basic cartoonish old cranky guy who of course hides a big heart. We need more than that. Can be watched. The mother of the boy is good in her role and the rest are well cast. The boy is also talented.,1425945600,,356,4.028169014084507

6784452,4,B00P1WGHLI,"St Vincent started off leaning too hard on the Bill Murray charm. The accent was too dodgy. Melissa McCarthy wasn't good. Naomi Watts was worse. Then the silent little kid (Jaeden Lieberher) stood up, shared the spotlight with Murray and the film hit its stride. It never let me down again.

The plot was obvious 10 minutes into the film but like Mike Tyson in his prime even though you know what coming it still knocks you out.

Great movie. Rent it, don't buy.

Oh and Chris O'Dowd was amazing. Hollywood: More O'Dowd please.",1425945600,,527,4.585106382978723

It cut through to the core of what it means to be human and how things appear vs. what they really are. Not to mention the very human tendency to assume, label and dismiss/minimize.

Refreshing amidst the churn of the Hollywood machine. Murray does not disappoint. Was surprised that Melissa McCarthy was playing the straight (wo)man and think she came across as believable. Personally, I was also happy to see her character stand up to Vincent by the end.

6784630,3,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent isn't really a good movie.  I mean, I guess I should probably start with that.  Its one of those movies that dwells in the realm of been there done that better before, and the predictability of it all can feel extremely lazy, and the ridiculousness of some (most) of the plot could, in the wrong hands, feel horribly mind-numbing, and some of these characters (most) are just so flat out preposterous that it should all crash and burn and quite frankly I should be writing a scathing review and yet, there is something about St. Vincent that feels so organically watchable.  Like, its so wholly enjoyable despite being so wholly awful.

Oh, and Bill Murray is just ON IT.

So, I guess Im not going to rip this one apart.

The premise for St Vincent feels like a weird amalgam of About a Boy and As Good as It Gets with a mandatory The Notebook sub-plot.  Its just awkward and clunky on paper.  It shouldnt work.  Add in a pregnant, Russian lady of the night and you have a movie that just makes no sense.  I mean, none of this makes any senseAT ALL!  A single mother, bitter from her philandering ex-husband, flees the confines of her home to the city where she has to work long hours and her son, who is awkward in his own right, is left to fend for himself.  They happen to move next-door to the worst neighbor in the world, a drunken crotchety old man who hates everybody.  Their first encounter is a messy one and leaves a bitter taste in both mouths, but as fate would have it, this single mother ends up relying on the jerk next-door to watch her son because she has no one else.  He needs to money, so he forces her to pay him, and she obliges becauseshes obviously used to being walked all over.

Lets take a second to think about this

A single mother, whos only encounter with her neighbor was an awful one, where he berated her and called her names and demanded she pay for damage that she didn't even cause, and who is obviously living in a pretty sorry state, feeding her son sardines out of a can and being very problematic and salty in her conversations with her, is going tolet him babysit her son?  She doesnt even inquire into WHY her son lost his keys and wallet (due to a bully harassing him).  Like, what (good) mother rationalizes that its easier than looking for another sitter?

No.

Lets move on.  So, this boy, Oliver, spends his days away from school with this mean old man, Vincent.  They take a shine to one another, especially once Vincent sees bullies beating Oliver up and he sees a way in which he can help the boy.  Their relationship grows, and Oliver becomes very attached to Vincent, viewing him as a father figure, now that his mother is keeping him away from his real father.  Things happen, words and actions are interchanged that destroy and then rebuild these relationships, all of which you could see coming from a mile away (once you embrace how dumb the movies actual plot is), and then the ending is just so horrible saccharine and just plain awful.

But, I likekind of loved this?

I feel like this is one long review of bashing how awful the script is, and I mean, how can you not?  The character development here is just ridiculous.  Maggie (the single mom) is just a terribly written character.  Aside from the aforementioned dumb decision, she is kind of a terrible mother.  Sure, shes struggling and she has this awful weight of Im going to lose my son, Ive been cheated on, I have to work plight, but she never even talks to Oliver about anything, she knows nothing that is ever going on (gallivanting with prostitutes, going to the races, at bars, witnessing a man drinking away his sorrows, gambling) and the way she treats her husband about Oliver despite the fact that Oliver so clearly loves his father is just gross.  Brother Geraghty, Olivers teacher (and the whole Christian school in general) is such a problematic stereotype that feels more mocking than anything else.  Daka, the Russian prostitute is just a dumb, dumb character, not because shes actually dumb but because shes kind of pointless.  It doesnt help that Naomi Watts is so randomly awkward in the role.  WHY?

And yet, the actors here (Watts aside) make this work so much.  I kind of hate Melissa McCarthy, but she is on a different level from her usual shtick here.  Like, her character is the epitome of senseless and yet she is so believably earnest.  She makes you sympathize even though you shouldnt, and her breakdown scene is heartbreaking.  Jaeden Lieberher is such a wonderful find, a beautifully fleshed out child performance that feels so honest; the perfect blend of childlike innocence and maturity beyond his years.

And then there is Bill Murray.  This was such a perfect performance.  From the believable accent work to the chipped away demeanor to the way he handled every arc with such subtlety despite his abrasive nature to the way he handled that strokeall of it was so honest and integral to this movie working.  No, the decisions made by everyone here makes little to no sense and yet, with the right convictions from the cast, they don't detract from the smile on my face through the film.

And yes, I cried at that awful conclusion.

Theodore Melfi should probably be shot for writing such a stupid, stupid script and yet he should probably be honored for finding a way to make it all work.  He has, believe it or not, a real subtle hand and so none of the films piled on preposterousness feels overwhelming to the viewer.  Id actually love to see what hed be able to accomplish with good material.

So, like I said in my opening statement; this is not a good movie, butit kind of is?",1425513600,,5648,4.523668639053255

6784712,4,B00P1WGHLI,"There is something that gravitates me towards movies where Bill Murray plays someone less than savory.  Steve Zissou comes to mind.  St. Vincent is another.  Here we have the unadorned Murray, stripped down to the grumpy every-man character with hidden motivation.  Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) moves into a Brooklyn neighborhood with her son Oliver (masterfully portrayed by Jaeden Liebeher) where they meet their new neighbor, Vincent (Murray) after the moving van snags on a tree branch and sends said branch raining down on Vincent's faux-wood-paneled crappy Chrysler Le Baron. There are words exchanged.  Poor Maggie is forced to work long hours as a CAT Scan tech to keep her and Oliver afloat, and him in a decent private catholic school.  During Oliver's first day, a pack of bullies snag his phone, wallet, keys and school uniform from his gym locker.  Oliver is forced to make his way home where he sits patiently waiting for his mother.  When Vincent arrives home, Oliver asks to use the phone.  Bingo, Vincent becomes Oliver's impromptu babysitter at $12/hour.  Vincent likes to smoke, drink, and gamble.  All of which he does badly.  Oh, and he occasionally gets visits from Daka (Naomi Watts), a pregnant Russian stripper/hooker. Of, course there are ulterior designs to Vincent's character, with hidden motivation underneath.  His wife of 40 years is in a home suffering from what we assume is late-stage Alzheimer's.  St. Vincent is not exactly original or though-provoking.  I get a tinge of Gran Torino along with Up! as well as a slew of other movies.  It's not original but it is entertaining.  Murray absolutely shines in these roles.  He excels at being an a**hole.  Just watch  his Wes Anderson stuff.  You may have to suspend your disbelief, I'm not sure any decent mother (struggling or not) would let the cantankerous old boozer nextdoor watch their kid.  She claims ignorance to the hooker and the gambling and the bar hopping her child.  But, please.  Otherwise, St. Vincent is a great flick.  Watch out, it just might make you cry, too.

St; Vincent was one of those movies that is you stay with it, your reward is large as the movie will touch you greatly.  The cast was perfect, and Bill Murray should have won as best actor.  I think if all the nominated pictures this year, Birdman was the worst.  I didn't personally see it but numerous friends that did said not to waste your money.

6784846,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Did I enjoy this movie? Yes I did. A whole lot.

Why? Because this movie had me laughing - and crying - out loud. You go through ups-and-downs about how you feel about the characters. Everyone has depth and different levels - the good characters aren't all good; the bad characters aren't all bad. People can change and that's evident in this story.

The pros: Great story that closed out well. The adorable cat. The fact that you could see the goodness in everyone. The fact that Melissa McCarthy just happens to be overweight and that it's not a central part of the story.

This movie is worth watching if you want to think about your emotions but still enjoy yourself. And, even though we watched this late at night, I stayed awake, which is more than I can say for many movies, during which I fall asleep after half an hour.

The cons: A bid of a bloody scene that made me cringe. I got a little confused about the outcome of the custody case. A good ending but mildly unsatisfying.",1425168000,,986,4.4010989010989015

It's more of a heart-warming human-interest story.  Bill Murray was great, as always, and Melissa McCarthy was so good as the mom.  The star of the show was the little kid, of course.  Not recommended for kids under 16, though...or maybe I'm just too conservative about sex scenes with prostitutes.

So, why pick the disabled to hurt?  Because, unlike other groups associated with vile labels, disabled children and their loved ones are soft targets for cruel urges.

Nothing explodes, and no one gets shot. But the movie serves up proof that things are not always what they seem, and that people often lead messy and complicated lives.

If you are then you will remember classics like Caddyshack, Stripes, GhostBusters, Groundhog Day, What About Bob and Scrogged. In this movie you see a different side to his acting. His performance is real, raw and I loved every minute of it. Melissa McCarthy is wonderful as well. I loved her in Bridesmaids lol. In this movie she is as real as life. This movie is rated ""R"" (for language). The character (St. Vincent) Isn't so much like Archie Bunker but it contains edgy material (for a mature audience only).

6784952,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray plays Vincent, a retired alcoholic who spends most of his days lounging on his couch with his cat watching TV or betting on horses or spending time with Daka (Naomi Watts), a stripper/prostitute. He seems to owe everybody money and nobody really likes him. Thats until he gets accidentally put in charge of his new neighbor Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) and her young son, Oliver. Maggie is dealing with a recent divorce, down on her luck and needs someone to care for her son. Unfortunately, the only person she has to turn to is the most unlikely candidate: Vincent. Bill Murray is excellent in the role and really raises the bar for all the other comedic performances around him. His chemistry with the young boy is dynamic and sweet. The film is really sweet and funny and all of the actors do a great job telling the story. The film sort of drifts in the third act into a court drama but it survives through its downfalls due to the strength of the first two acts and all the acting involved.",1425081600,,1005,4.527472527472527

It would have needed to be funnier if they wanted me to focus on peoples money problems, legal problems and relationship problems. I know Bill Murray thinks he is too good for another ghostbusters movie because he wants to be gritty and artsy but this isn't it. Bill Murray delivered as always and the other actors were good too but this story could have been told in 60 minutes and should have been funnier so that it equaled out all of the ugliness.

6785206,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Vincent (Bill Murray) is a mean old guy; a curmudgeon.  He drinks too much.  He gambles.  Hes virtually broke.  And he owes money to some dangerous people and also to his pregnant Russian hooker/girl friend (Naomi Watts).

When a single mother (Melissa McCarthy) with a twelve year-old son (Jaeden Lieberher) moves into the house next to his, Vincents life begins to change.  He agrees to baby-sit the boy after school (for $12.00 per hour).  The pair quickly bond and, not only does the mean old guy teach the kid how to stand up to bullies, but he also takes him to the racetrack where he discovers that the boy has a knack for picking winners.  The youngster, on the other hand, discovers that there is a soft, secret side to Vincent that the world does not see.

Written and directed by Theodore Melfi, ST. VINCENT is an winning comedy with a big heart.  Murray, McCarthy and Watts all step out of their acting comfort zones to create a trio of unforgettable characters with multiple layers of complexity.

Making his film debut, young Jaeden Lieberher is certainly engaging, and Chris ODowd, Terrence Howard. Kimberly Quinn and Donna Mitchell also make strong contributions with their various roles.

The Blu-ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment contain several deleted scenes, which is good because they help explain a couple of story points that are not addressed in the film itself.  There are also a featurette containing a Q&A session dealing with Bill Murray and his contributions to the movie and to the field of comedy.

6785207,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I'm not much of a movie person, and for some hard core movie people, this might be a little light, but I like human redemption, and this story hit me just right. At least it's not about vampires, zombies, or twisted idiots trying to perform surgery without anesthesia. The humor was light and welcome, throughout, for me. My sense of humor is complex and just a bit twisted, but not sadistic. I found numerous chuckle points but not many laugh out loud moments. I'm not a big fan of Melissa McCarthy, but she did well in this effort.

Bill Murray's character was less than likeable, but it was easy to enjoy his work, if not his character's actions. Maybe being older than he and his character helped a little... it certainly helped with the humor. Until you're older, you might not appreciate it, but it just might make you laugh, if you can remember that long... and you get that old.

After watching another movie that took twelve years to create, and still couldn't amuse me very much, I was inspired to rate this one, because it's been one of the best I've seen in the last five years. Some people had a problem with the rating, but at my age, I didn't notice any of the off color action. Guess I'm too old for that kind of thing to offend me. At least I didn't detect any attempts to influence my politics, like that twelve year old show.",1424908800,,1344,4.393574297188755

Bill Murray was fabulous and the child actor more than held his own. Melissa McCarthy repulses me in most of her roles but she knocked this one out of the park. Her talent is reveiled as far as i am concerned.",1424908800,,389,3.9240506329113924

I came to Mike and Molly late but I love that show now...Molly on the big screen has been an utter disaster with that string of awful and awful-er movies. I see her on a movie poster and cringe...but this is a great movie. The kid is the absolute best...unbelievable! The hooker is the second best. Those two steal the show and it never comes back. And the writer/director obviously got to make his vision---I cringe when I see those two parts going to the same person because there are too many filmmakers who cannot write a story and seem to think we won't notice, i.e. Chef and Boyhood. And since I have Boyhood on the screen which is my mind-- here is my Academy rant...nobody cares what you think anymore... not after Boyhood and Silver Linings Playbook. Dog one and dog two.

My only gripe is that I think the title and poster are a bit of a spoiler for the film.",1424822400,,911,4.3274853801169595

His character in 'St. Vincent' is similar, a man wounded by the slings and arrows of the life in which he lived, but whose humanity remains unscathed, albeit, hidden deeply below the surface. His intentions are ultimately good, however oddly he presents them. In the end 'St. Vincent' earns his moniker and accepts it with grace.

Birdman was just not made right...it could have been made with Keaton having a home and family life..not just stuck in a play..anyway....st vincent showed us a home and family life...and how things can go wrong and how things can go right..and how things can get better..even with strangers..i love bill Murray..it would have been amazing to see Murray get the Oscar for best actor...or best picture of the year!!!!!..but that's only what i feel...and I'm only one person..and lastly!!!

The telling remains open from the beginning that one might recognize where one's life would fit within the story while considering whether the bits of humor,  and just getting by, would be enough to withstand the the growing weight of attachment spiraling one through the years..

Consistently fine acting throughout, particularly Jaeden Liberher as Oliver  whose timing is perfect and whose voice is strong.

6785379,5,B00P1WGHLI,"I gave five stars because:  The underlying stories are not complicated; each situation is necessary to the ending; it is very moral-of-the-story, don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover; the acting is superb; it is well-written; and it made me want to work harder to be a better person - just because!  It is hard to review the movie without spoiling the story.  But I can say that the beginning implies that this is just another movie about a crotchety, drunken Bill Murray character.  Stay with the movie and you will see tenderness, dedication, and loyalty.  Even better, ALL of the characters find those qualities within themselves, and within the people they come to love because of it.  If you are looking for big plot, action, special effects, or an emotional catharsis/exorcism, this is not for you.  If you are looking for laughter, sneering, OMGing, redemption, revelation, and a really simple and quiet message of compassion and empathy, then this is it.

The two most important reasons to watch this movie are:  It makes you really want to be a better human - just because.  And, it shows that FAMILY is defined by the love you give and the love you are given - period.  Family.

Keep in mind that this is rated PG-13, so it is not for all the family to watch.  But it is for the viewers to be reminded that family is what you make it, it is what you want it to be, and it is synonymous with love.",1424476800,,1401,4.600806451612903
6785380,4,B00P1WGHLI,"St. Vincent is a film of surprises. In the right hands and the right actors, it comes alive. It is not one of those films that we have seen over and over. It could have been very easily, but what we have here is top notch acting that rises above the mundane.

Vincent, is played by Bill Murray, in one of his rare starring films. He plays a down and out man on his way to alcoholism. His house is a mess, but in a relatively nice area of New York. He lives alone, gambles, visits the local bar and sleeps with a pregnant 'woman of the night', played by Naomi Watts. He is broke, his reverse mortgage has reversed as much as it can. One of those cantankerous old men we see in most every neighborhood.

One day after Vincent has run over his gate, new neighbors move in. The movers hit his tree and a limb crashes into Vincent's car. Out he comes to meet them, Melissa McCarthy plays Maggie, mother to Oliver, played by Jaeden Lieberher. What a sweet child, wise beyond his years, off with his mom, while the divorce from his dad comes through. It turns out Olivers mom has to work long hours, And Oliver signs up as babysitter for $11 an hour. Oliver and Vincent hit it off, and this leads to the horse races, afternoons at the bar, and visiting Vincent's wife at a facility for Alzheimers.

The usual occurs, dad wants custody, Oliver meets the bullies of the school, Vincent teaches him how to fight, they dine on sushi of Vincent's making. All the while Vincent and Oliver have bonded, and Oliver shows Vincent exactly what he means to him. Superb acting, Melissa McCarthy shows she has great acting chops outside of her comedy. Surprise actors show up in small parts that proves good actors can make or break a film.

6785381,3,B00P1WGHLI,"The moral of this story I thought was very deep and very good.  I would have liked to have been able to let my kids watch it for that very reason, however, in order to depict the depth of ""the bad side"" of the main character, the producers chose to illustrate things pretty graphically.  It's only in a handful of scenes, but it is pretty in your face in those scenes.  For myself, I think they could have easily made the point clear without having to actually watch it happening, but that's just my opinion.",1424476800,,508,4.326315789473684
6785382,5,B00P1WGHLI,I rented this just because Bill was in it.  I love him.  I have to say I loved every.single.moment of this movie.  It starts out a bit...how shall I say it..rough around the edges.  But by the end of the movie you find that roughness is needed to make this movie as magical as it is.  This movie not only made me laugh and cry but it made me think about the old saying....never judge a book by it's cover.  Bill plays a hard to like...maybe even and easy to hate old man.  By the end you wish he was your neighbor.  The whole cast was perfectly choosen.....they were outstanding...each one of them.  I would say this is probably one of my new favorite movies and will be ordering it to add to my collection of movies that I feel are worth watching over and over again.,1424476800,,768,4.170068027210885

6785399,5,B00P1WGHLI,"In the interest of full disclosure, this movie was basically made for me. Lately, I am burned out on just about every movie genre and have found that the only satisfying movie experience for me is something dramatic, smart, and painfully funny. This  movie delivered in every sense. I have a really strange sense of humor--I'll admit-- but the little guy in this movie made me die laughing. I don't remember if I laughed until I cried or cried until I laughed. It was heart warming, but not at all schmaltzy. It was funny, but not at all disgusting. I cannot believe I didn't see more press for this movie. Bill Murray was just exceptional and McCarthy sparkled as the overworked mother; however, Jaeden Lieberher stole the show 1000%. This kid has real acting chops. It was a finely crafted movie in that it was elegant and simplistic. The film, and its cast of misfits, never tried too hard and felt painfully real. Even the pregnant, Russian hooker. I went into this movie having absolutely no idea what it was about and emerged with a new favorite modern classic. If you were like me and ""The Interview"" made you want to kill yourself... I highly recommend this one.",1424390400,,1170,4.625

I'm a lifelong fan of Bill Murray, and have only recently discovered how talented Melissa McCarthy is, and when I found out they were doing a movie together, I almost cried. Seriously. Almost cried from sheer joy.

The movie did not disappoint, in fact was better than I had even expected because I went into it prepared to like it no matter what because I am such huge fans of the stars. But it turned out to not only be one of Bill Murray's best performances, both the dramatic and comedic aspects of the film, but the story is very good.

I like when movies include deleted scenes in general, but sometimes they just make me feel like yeah I can see why they were deleted, but I actually enjoyed the deleted scenes included on this dvd.",1424390400,,811,4.466216216216216

6785432,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Good movie, great acting by all of them specially the little kid ( Jaeden Lieberher) who's life evolves around the main grown ups like Bill Murray, Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts. He plays Melissa's son, whom struggling to make a living while after her divorce and is now fighting for full custody with x-husband for her child. Do not watch this movie expecting it to be a comedy, because it is not. Also, this is ""completely"" a Bill Murray movie.
He's role as ""St. Vincent"" is one of the best, if not his best since I have seen his movies and I have grown to like him more and more in my opinion, as he seems to have matured maybe within the last 5 years. (I was never a fan of movies like Ghostbusters, as popular as it was) the story takes Melissa and her kid (very smart and educated and was great in his timing with his lines) so while she is hard at work till all hours realizes has no one to take care of her kid, after hours, not even time to take him and pick him up from school.
Bill is a retired vet living alone and hooked in gambling, drinking, and of course playing the ""ponies"" with the hopes to hit the jackpot at one point.
 He doesn't care about the conditions of how things are within his house simply because he's just not organized and life has hit him hard and takes things one day at time. However, under all that ""carelessness"" lies his true responsible self while trying to maintain his wife at an ""assistance care"" facility and paying for it best he can and has been doing it for ten years or so, to make sure she gets the best possible care while suffering from dementia.
Melissa needs assistance with someone to take care of her kid while she's at work and he needs extra money to survive and keep up with his gambling, drinking ways and agrees to take of the boy after hours by charging her horrendous rates without her having no choice but to pay them.
Both Bill and the kid (Oliver) end up ""developing a great friendship"" even though at first he wasn't too crazy about kids, any kids.
Script was well written and the acting was great from each of the characters playing their respective roles. It is a story about life with a different point of view of life from ""each and everyone"" of them struggling through it while trying to make sense of it all. You'll smile at times, you will feel as if you have been living right among them as a shadow as the movie allows you to get close to the characters and you will feel sad at times and you will laugh at times.
There are great scenes when Bill is laying in his lounging chair in his back yard drinking beer and listening to his I-pod music while teaching the kid how to earn and learn responsibility when gives the kid a chore to complete which is hilarious as to what the chore ended up being! (it is vintage Bill Murray) which Melissa gets home while this is going on and was surprised to see.
There are no sex scenes, there are lots of life lessons letting you know how ""everyone"" in this world struggles one way or another on a day by day basis while at the same time caring for a love one that means lots to you, no matter how hard you go about doing it.
You also should be very satisfied with a great ending of this movie having to do how Oliver, in learning each day more and more about his new found friend Bill (neighbor) and the man's struggles that all thru his life appeared to not matter to anyone, even him, although he was a great human being and finally gets recognized for it, by who better than Oliver that to his (BILL) surprise, put tears in his eyes and it might just do the same to you, when you watch it. Enjoy it.",1424390400,,3618,4.23589001447178

6785437,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Surprisingly good. Bill Murray still has it going on. As expected, Murray is goofy, at times ""I don't give a damn"" with a dab of heart of mush. Murray hasn't lost his touch on pulling at the heart string. Melissa McCarthy is Murray's perfect sidekick. They feed off each other very well. For me, that is, the first time I've seen Naomi Watts act. I thought her character to neatly complete the story circle. Watts was silly as far as a ""lady of the night"" go. What I thought ""St. Vincent"" meant and what it ended up to be was totally off; in a good way. I enjoyed St. Vincent very much.",1424390400,,586,4.241071428571429

6785445,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Good movie, both my wife and I enjoyed it.  Good laughs, plus some emotional moments.  One of Murray's finer moments -- this is a deep character with a very rough outside.  There is a moral lesson here as well, something about books and covers and judging... in fact the entire cast did an excellent job with their characters, giving depth to each, and really making the audience connect with each of them -- although each is very very different from the other.",1424390400,,461,4.597560975609756

6785514,5,B00P1WGHLI,"With all the hype surrounding so many releases, it is amazing that this particular film came and went with little fanfare. The plot synopsis is posted elsewhere so let's delve into the quality. McCarthy and Murray, both comics known for their over the top performances, reign it in to deliver  true to life and reasonable life situations.

6785522,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Cherubic kid saves grizzled curmudgeon. This scenario has been a staple of the big screen since time immemorial. Yawn, right?  Oh, did I mention the lovable hooker with a heart? Gah! The frazzled single mom down on her luck? Gag. When I saw the previews for this film I actually groaned out loud wondering just how many stereotypes could be jam-packed into a single film. Still, I couldn't escape from the generous ratings and praise it kept receiving, and had to see for myself what this little tale had to offer. Thank Heaven, I did.

Granted, the linchpin is none other than Bill Murray himself cast in the title role. It's no secret that Murray is a comedic genius, and any other actor portraying the old drunken bastard whose holiness is hidden and the film would have been a Hot Holly Hobby Mess. That said, the film's true integrity comes in the form of Melissa McCarthy whose real talent is often hidden behind fat jokes and potty humor. When she vomited her vitriol at her philandering ex-husband at the parent-teacher conference, her performance was so organic and perfectly delivered, I was gut-punched and had to pause the film to catch my breath. The fact that she isn't overshadowed by Murray's on-screen brilliance is a feat in and of itself. Kudos to McCarthy. I pray she gets more roles worthy of her enormous talent.

This film has its critics, especially those who find it formulaic and even the naysayers who warn of the ""bad parenting"" it encourages. These viewers are sadly missing the entire point of the film. Yes, the plot may be predictable, but it's never saccharine. The raw, gritty underbelly makes sure to keep any overly sentimental tripe in check. Anyone who's dealt with PTSD or alcoholism (or both) will feel the authenticity of Murray's claustrophobic performance. And frankly, I find it refreshing to see a current film that isn't afraid to even mention religion without demeaning it and still manage to remind us that even the worst of us have worth and something of value to offer society without sermonizing. Experienced moviegoers may be offended by the slightly sappy soundtrack -- but it's not just a rookie mistake. It'll be nice when directors finally realize that they needn't outline what's happening on screen with their perfectly timed auditory cheat-sheets.

I expect we'll be seeing more from director Melfi who was smart to ""play it safe"" with a time-proven plot and managing to pull such far-reaching talent into his project because it worked, and worked very, very well. Be aware that this isn't just a feel-good flick. It has shrewd grit and gusto between the hardy (and hearty) laughs.",1423958400,,2640,4.86

6785525,4,B00P1WGHLI,"As I post this review there are already 47 reviews posted, with a wide range of ratings and comments. Many of these are from the reviewer seeing the film in theaters.  This review is based on the Bluray disc provided to me by Anchor Bay. I'll provide some general comments on the film and then focus on the Bonus Features on the BD.

""St. Vincent"" is the first film from director Ted Melfi and is not unlike a lot of similar films where a sloppy cranky guy gets compassion from a young kid. This role is the kind that gets offered to actors like Jack Nicholson, Robert DiNiro or Walter Mattheau. In this case it's Bill Murray who carries the film and his performance is GREAT. The young boy (Jaeden Lieberer) is wonderful too.  Melissa McCarthy carries her weight (and proves she can act without a barrage of expletives) in a role that don't need much. Naomi Watts is here as a Russian (?) hooker and, in my opinion, got a bit annoying with her selfish attitude.

So, I'd give the script (also by Melfi)  three stars for being pedestrian, but Murray and Lieberher each get five stars. Hence my four star rating.

The BD has two bonus features. First is a series of  about a dozen deleted scenes. These total 10 minutes. They don't really add to the story and -in most cases - would actually change the direction of the film if used. But fun to watch. The other bonus is a 19 minute piece called"" ""Bill Murray is St. Vincent: The Patron Saint of Comedy"". It consists of video from the Q&A at the Toronto International  Film Festival with the cast, mixed with scenes from the film. There is also part of the Q&A with Murray and director Ivan Reitman from the same TIFF where ""Ghostbusters:"" screened on its 40th anniversary.  Honestly, adding the clips from the film you have just seen makes no sense. I would much have preferred it they just included all of the Q&A without interruption. Still, Murray is funny as he answers the questions. A story about his cab ride in Brooklyn is really funny.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6785526,3,B00P1WGHLI,"Mom divorces husband. Takes kid and moves to some seedy part of NYC on the wrong side of the bridge. Neighbor is a hard drink drinker and cohorts with prostitutes. Neighbor provides kid some toughening up lessons. We all discover the man is a big softy after a lot of movie drama.

Well it is a touching movie. Kinda reminds me of DeNiro's ""We're fine"". However, I simply cannot understand this obsession Hollywood has with elevating prostitutes, drunks, druggies . . . well bascially anyone in the underworld . . . to touchy feely status. Is this wishful thinking? Is this liberal thought that we are all just the same but some of us didn't have the breaks that others had? What is it exactly? Because in reality ville we all know this is not true. Anyway if you can overcome that I guess you can appreciate this movie. Also what is it with this idea that a radiological tech can afford a house and a kid and a car and a babysitter in any NYC borough on their own? Again . . . not reality ville. Also I don't understand this idea that just because you think your family member should be put in a mansion-like nursing home but you cannot afford it doesn't really mean you can. But this story is selling the idea that it is OK to sell drugs, steal from people, etc to do just that as long as you had ""good intentions"".

The ""I had good intentions"" campaign is really a dangerous one. At first you think he had to do what he had to do. But who has to put their family in the ""best"" nursing home--by best I mean most expensive? Sure we all would. But it isn't reality. It isn't even necessary. But that is the justification of selling drugs so that someone else's family members are hurt? Unmistakable liberal selfishness.",1423699200,,1719,4.36875

6785532,2,B00P1WGHLI,"I'm giving this 2 stars because after renting ""Before I Disappear"", which has a similar plot, this movie was quite disappointing, especially with a cast like Murray, McCarthy, and Watts.

""Before I Disappear"" was written, directed, and stars Shawn Christensen. It is an expanded version of an award winning short, ""Curfew"" he made with his own money a couple of years ago.

It is SUPERB, and not a hole, or even a ""chink"" in its plot or characters.

St. Vincent seemed kind of cheesy in comparison, from the score, to Murray's on-and-off overdone, not even Brooklyn accent, and having him march down the aisle at the end...........

The first big hole I felt, when the kid's wallet, expensive cell phone, and ALL his clothes were stolen from his gym locker, NOTHING was said about it from a financially strapped, newly single mother, until the end.

Where did he get a complete new uniform?  And apparently, he didn't get another phone...................

I also expected to find out the baby was not Murray's, but that was left unclear.  Maybe It's just me, but picturing or contemplating whether he impregnated Watt's character is kind of creepy...................

6785534,5,B00P1WGHLI,"""St. Vincent"" is the kind of movie that is sadly being edged out of multiplexes by overblown, mega-budget action flicks. It's a small film about real people with real problems, flaws, and an inherent dignity that reaffirms the fact that there are hard-working, decent people out there.

Vincent (Bill Murray) is what you'd call a curmudgeon. He doesn't warm to people and his closed-off attitude keeps others at a distance. For Vincent, this is fine. It allows him to live life as he wants to -- seeing a local lady of the evening (Naomi Watts) regularly, drinking before noon, chain smoking, going to the race track and gambling on the ponies.

His life changes when Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) and her son, Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher), move in next store. Things get off to a rough start when the moving van Maggie has hired clips a branch of a sturdy old tree in front of Vincent's house.

Maggie is a single mother starting a new job as a medical technician that requires her to work irregular, long hours. She can't rely on being around for Oliver after school. When bullies take his wallet and house key, Oliver has to walk home and can't get in his house. Seeing Vincent, he asks to use his phone to call his Mom. Since Vincent's sources of income are limited, he offers Maggie a deal to look after Oliver until she gets home from work. Having nowhere else to turn, Maggie agrees.

At this point, director Theodore Melfi allows us a closer look at the lives and backgrounds of Vincent and Maggie. Vincent turns out to be far more complex and interesting than we first perceive. And Maggie is not a mere comedy bouncing board but a very real woman going through hard times and trying to be the best mother she can, all the while harboring guilt because she can't look after Oliver 100% of the time.

 Bill Murray does double duty in ""St. Vincent."" He elicits laughs with his grungy, gruff characterization while showing a depth that lesser screen comedies never bother with. This approach lets us see a multi-faceted individual rather than a dispenser of one-liners. Much of the film's humor derives from the relationship between Vincent and Oliver, as the boy's innocence comes crashing into Vincent's unbridled hedonism. Oliver gets many lessons in life as a result, but far too soon and from the oddest of role models.

 Ms. McCarthy, who has built a career playing slovenly, foul-mouthed women in full-out slapstick style, turns in a surprisingly touching, restrained portrayal as Maggie. This is a solid characterization, even though her screen time is far less than Murray's. In fact, she's almost a straight man in the scenes she shares with Murray. Because she's not a wisecracking, jokey mother, we take her Maggie seriously.

There is a sub-plot involving a loan shark (Terrence Howard) who is getting impatient for his money that never really goes anyplace significant, but for the most part ""St. Vincent"" is an engaging portrait of a man whose actions and appearance define him in his community. His past is largely kept to himself, but as we learn about it, we see that Vincent is far more than a Hawaiian-shirted ne'er-do-well loafing on a lounge chair in his back yard, drink in hand. Rated PG-13, ""St. Vincent"" doesn't have a single explosion or gun shot, but it is a riveting, entertaining study in human nature.",1423267200,14,3331,4.7791304347826085

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

St. Vincent is by neophyte screenwriter, Thomas Melfi. His tale stars Bill Murray as Vincent MacKenna, an alcoholic, Vietnam War Vet curmudgeon, who lives in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. The inciting incident occurs when his new next door neighbor, Maggie Bronstein (played by Melissa McCarthy in a rare non-obnoxious role), must hire MacKenna to watch her 12 year old son, half-Jewish parochial school student, Oliver (winningly played by Jaeden Lieberher), while she's working as a medical technician at a local clinic.

The clichs abound all over the place from the get go. One just gets so tired of watching school bullies pick on their more diminutive fellow students for no reason at all except to move the plot along. Here, Mackenna ends up teaching Oliver how to slug his main tormentor in the face with a short uppercut to the chin. Objecting to this is Clich #2, Mackenna's Russian girlfriend, a prostitute with a heart of gold named Daka, played by a miscast Naomi Watts.

The plot meanders along as Oliver attempts to bond with MacKenna who takes him to Belmont racetrack where they end up winning a couple of thousand dollars on an unlikely trifecta wager. MacKenna displays his devoted side by paying daily visits to his ex-wife, an Alzheimer's victim, who he has set up in an upscale assisted living facility, without having the funds to pay for it.

MacKenna also owes a great deal of money to a loan shark who along with some other thugs are about to work the hapless curmudgeon over, when he suddenly has a stroke. The rest of St. Vincent focuses on MacKenna's rehabilitation and descent into further moroseness, when he learns his wife has died and been cremated, while he's recuperating in the hospital.

May I also mention there's a subplot dealing with Maggie who is trying to prevent her husband from gaining full custody of Oliver? The boy recognizes he also needs to be with his father and the initial gambit that the father is some kind of monster, fizzles completely. Instead, uptight Maggie, must concede that 50-50 custody is not an unreasonable solution to the custody conflict between the two parents.

The miserable MacKenna ends up rejecting Oliver after the death of his ex-wife but the clever parochial school student has a plan to resurrect the bum from the depths of despair. The school has asked all the kids to pick out their favorite saint so Oliver does a wonderful slide show on his next-door-neighbor who he dubs 'St. Vincent', a man he extolls as a hero despite all his shortcomings. Luckily, Daka tricks MacKenna into arriving at the school assembly where he gratefully acknowledges the cheers of the crowd after they watch Oliver's presentation.

The slide show is really the highlight of the film and it's certainly heartfelt. It's kind of unbelievable that such a curmudgeon would be turned around so easily, given all the negative behavior we're privy to before the sudden transformation.

Watch St. Vincent for the generally solid performances. Murray manages to jettison his happy-go-lucky persona which he cultivated so assiduously in his early days as a fledgling actor. Even McCarthy acquits herself admirably (especially in one particular scene where she emotes over her difficult life and upbringing).

Rex Reed in his review in the NY Observer, perhaps sums up 'St. Vincent' best when he cogently writes: ""It's an O.K. little picture that doesn't really go anywhere, but it has a resonance that is easy on the heart.""",1419292800,8,3537,4.9393939393939394

6785552,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy in the same movie? This I've gotta see!

Written and directed by Theodore Melfi, this PG-13 comedy looks at the effects of a divorce on a young boy when his mom moves next door to a curmudgeonly drunk.

Sounds predictable, doesn't it? Well, it IS. But here is the surprise: Along the way we are treated to outstanding performances by all of the primary actors, including the little boy, AND we are entertained.

We watch:
  * Bill Murray (""The Monuments Men"") as our eponymous hero, who finds having a child next door is almost diverting, because he can have him help deliver laundry and take him to the race track.
  * Melissa McCarthy (""Identity Thief"") Maggie begins to doubt her neighbor, particularly when her son wins a schoolyard fight.
  * Naomi Watts (""The Impossible"") Daka never had a daytime job but pole dancing doesn't provide maternity leave.
  * Jaeden Lieberher (""Playing it Cool"") Oliver is caught by the class bully and has to learn how to stick up for himself. Plus he figures out what a trifecta pays and Mom is upset to learn he has been in a bar.
  * Chris O'Dowd (""Cuban Fury"") Brother Geraghty has Oliver in his classroom. This priest shows great flexibility when it comes to religions and he assigns his students interesting projects.
  * Terrence Howard (""Sabotage"") Zucko is Vincent's bookie and Vincent owes him a LOT of money.

There are many noteworthy scenes but it was nice to realize that we are allowed to figure out much of the plot on our own. Expect mild profanity, a schoolyard brawl, a drunken Vincent injuring himself and a poignant history. Our screening audience applauded.

BTW: Be sure to stay during the final credits because Murray entertains us with a garden hose and a Bob Dylan recording.

6785553,5,B00P1WGHLI,Outstanding.  Story line was awesome and Bill Murray outdid himself.  Can't wait until it comes out on DVD.,1417046400,,107,4.888888888888889
6785554,5,B00P1WGHLI,"This is one of the BEST movies I've seen in a LONG time!!  It's funny, touching and entertaining.  I actually have seen it more than once in the theater -- which I NEVER do anymore due to the cost!  But it was so good, after seeing it with a friend I dragged my husband to the theater to see it!  PLEASE do yourself a favor and watch this movie!  I truly feel you won't regret it!",1416960000,3,380,3.9473684210526314
6785555,2,B00P1WGHLI,"Bill Murray is a great comedian, but this movies theme, that everyone has a little goodness in them if you just look hard enough, wasn't very compellingly presented, and I don't entirely agree with the theme either.  The story is fairly simple:  Melissa McCarthy is divorced and is moving to a new neighborhood with her son.  Almost immediately, she clashes with the slob next door (Bill Murray), who smokes and drinks, bets on horse races, and has an ongoing affair with a stripper with an eastern European accent.  Her son Oliver is, Id estimate, around 10, and Bill Murrays grumpy slob character teaches him how to defend himself, while also struggling with debt and with McCarthys fear that hes a bad influence on Oliver.  Murrays character was a Vietnam vet and is unable to keep supporting his wife financially, whos in a nursing home.  People learn to see the goodness in Vincent, and hes given a special honor by Oliver in school for being a good personbut hes not even a faithful husband, and he doesnt really change by the end either.  Im still trying to figure out whether the movie is saying you should be satisfied with the way you are, or just saying few people are ALL BAD.  I didn't like the cussing in the movie, either.  At least the smoking was mostly a token thing.  Very rarely did Vincent blow on the cigarette in his hand or mouth.",1416700800,4,1354,4.580912863070539

6785557,3,B00P1WGHLI,"It was okay to good at best. It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, I had expected to be sitting in the theater for two hours waiting for the movie to end. I found that I was pleasantly pulled into the movie and I could relate to it. There were a few funny bits, but overall there wasn't a moment in the movie where I thought 'Wow, this is really great/amazing.'",1416614400,,373,3.986666666666667
6785558,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Wow,...what a phenomenal movie this was!  Totally unexpected too.  I was under the impression (from the trailers) that this was going to be more of a comedy than anything else.  Was I WRONG!  Now, don't misunderstand me,...there is a lot of comedy to be had, but the actual story telling and emotion provided by the cast is unmatched in any film I've seen in recent memory.  For starters, Naomi Watts role as Daka (Vincent's ""Woman of the Night"") was outstanding.  I wasn't sure I was going to like her with the accent, but she nailed it.  Murrey as Vincent, honestly,.....there's no need to elaborate on his skill as an actor.  Melissa McCarthy.....seriously, if she doesn't receive, at the very LEAST, an Oscar nomination, I'll be very surprised.  For the first time, she actually puts herself in a role other than her typical ""funny"" spot.  Her acting in this will definitely not go unnoticed!  Lastly, we have newcomer, Jaeden Lieberher as Oliver.  This kid was brilliant!  I really hope to see more of him in the future!

I don't want to ruin the movie for you by telling any of the plot (not that it's really a secret) because I enjoyed it so much WITHOUT knowing anything about it.  I'm not sure you will find a movie with this quality acting anytime soon.  If you're in the mood to cry, laugh, whatever,...you're going to love this!  I, personally, am not much of a crier (watching movies), but this one ALMOST got me going!

Final Verdict:  A MUST watch!  (I can not stress this enough!)",1416441600,5,1496,4.61596958174905
6785559,4,B00P1WGHLI,"Finally Bill Murray at his best.  So many movies in the past seeing Bill Murray in a drama role without the true comedian that lies inside this true artist.  I loved this movie that starred Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy, who play a part in a serious  role.  Bill's character is truly flawed, but he suffers from the loss of a wife to Alzheimer's.  I guess there was a time when Vincent was a model citizen but his pains drives him to drink, gamble, and involve himself with prostitutes.  Yet one day he is forced to look up to God and say ""Take me God, don't play with me"".  I guess because he lives an empty life and God is not playing with him as he bring him a little boy to enjoy.

It is a lovely story very enjoyable, and I have no doubt a money maker, and maybe even a nomination for best picture, or best actor in a comedy role.  It is a wonderful story that warms the heart and makes you laugh and enjoy yourself.",1416009600,5,924,4.11731843575419
6785560,5,B00P1WGHLI,"Vincent (Bill Murray) is a baby boomer who failed to adequately plan for his retirement. His money has ran out. Fred Thompson won't give him another dime on his reverse mortgage. He has a rough exterior as he drinks, gambles, and frequents a prostitute (Naomi Watts). Circumstance places him as a baby sitter for puny Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) the son of soon to be single mom Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) who has her own issues.

While Vinny introduces Oliver to vices, he also sees the basic compassion and humanity in the man no one would expect to have any.

The film is funny and heart warming almost as if it was a  Magnolia indie. Murray and McCarthy did an excellent job as did the supporting cast. Chris O'Dowd as Brother Geraghty was a hoot.
