904039,4,6304646100,"Being a ""Wallace and Gromit"" fan I recently bought this video, since Nick Park's first Oscar winner, ""Creature Comforts,"" is featured.  That 5 min skit focuses on interviews with claymation animals in  a zoo about their impressions of zoo life.  A creative and entertaining  offering.  It's easy to see why it was a winner.  Younger children may not  appreciate the extremely dry British humor of ""Creature Comforts""  though.  It's still 5 stars in my book.  ""Creature Comforts"" is,  by the way, the only Nick Park offering on the tape.
The next offering,  ""Wat's Pig,"" is a nearly silent story of royalty, a stolen twin  heir to the throne, and what happens to each of the twins as they grow.  This is probably the piece that is most entertaining to viewers of all  ages, though it lacks some of the fundamental charm of characters like  ""Wallace and Gromit.""  A 4 star offering in my book.  Good but  not fabulous.
The third offering, ""Not Without My Handbag,"" is  a dark claymation offering, featuring the devil who recruits new  inhabitants of hell by having them sign incredibly complicated lease  agreements for appliances.  This is a rather grizzly flick that is not at  all suitable for younger children (maybe younger than 10 yrs or so), even  though it is filmed in a medium typically earmarked for them.  The story is  interesting, but I don't plan to watch it many if any more times.  It  probably does deserve some critical acclaim, but this is NOT a film for  children...I can alreay hear the wailing from bad dreams in the middle of  the night if my children were to watch it.
The fourth flick,  ""Adam,"" is a somewhat comical silent film depicting the creation  of a being on a small planet.  It does have some good sight gags, and Adam  -- the main character -- has a personality that you soon get to know.  I  have to admit that I wasn't too jazzed to see that the animator chose to  make Adam anatomically correct (though not overtly so).  If that had not  been the case, I would say that this film is fair game for the younger set.  But, as it stands, we chose not to show this one to our kids either.  It  is, nevertheless, still an entertaining offering, especially as Adam  interacts with his small planet.
I'd say that the first show is  definitely 5 stars, while the others are in the 3.5 to 4 star range, for an  overall rating of 4 stars for the entire tape.
This tape is best reserved  for the adult claymation fan, rather than for viewing by younger  children.
4 stars.

904040,5,6304646100,"Aardman animation has produced some of the best stop-frame, claymation adventures I've seen--ever.  I'm an animation addict, so I know what I'm saying.
""Creature Comforts"" is a bit different than some of  Nick Park's other work.  I'm sure you've heard of his newest adventure,  ""Chicken Run,"" and maybe you know about ""Wallace &  Gromit.""  All three of the W&G adventures are fantastic and if you  do know of them, then you'll probably enjoy ""Creature Comforts.""  The witty British humor can't be beat.
This video is a collection of four  shorts.  Each short has a feeling of its own and brings a different level  of humor to the whole collection.
The first short is the namesake of this  collection.  ""Creature Comforts"" is a documentary, of sorts.  The  viewer gets an inside look at life in a London Zoo.  The animals are so  cute!  Even the feces is crafted in a ""cute"" way (if you can say  that about excrement). As the characters discuss their lives in the zoo  they comment on what could be improved: the temperature, the food, and as  the large cat says (with a notable Brazillian accent), ""More space.  We need more space.""  It is a funny short, but there is a deeper  meaning if you care to look for it.  It's played occasionally on Cartoon  Network or Nickelodeon between commercials--keep your eyes peeled for it if  you decide not to purchase this collection.  You may like it.
The second  short on the tape is called ""Wat's Pig.""  This is a cute-sy story  of twins separated at birth; one boy becomes the King and the other becomes  a farmer.  Wat is the farmer, but the question is...is he unlucky?  Through  the course of the adventure a viewer is entertained, but also is shown the  lesson that power and money do not necessarily bring happiness.  This one  is not the best on the tape, but it is enjoyable and fine viewing for the  whole family.
If you're still reading this review, I'd like to talk about  the next short--it is the best on the tape!  ""Not Without My  Handbag"" is a wacko story of a lady being sent to hell because she did  not make her washer payment on time.  Some French/English tension that  exists in the world is displayed in a comical way here.  Aardman chose to  portray the devil as a gluttonous Frenchman--the underwriter to the washer  payment contract.  Oh, it's quite funny and some of my favorite lines have  come from this short, such as a complacently phrased: ""My Auntie is a  zombie from hell.""  This comes from the little girl pictured on the  cover of the video (in the polka dot dress).
Although I often stop the  tape once I've enjoyed the third short (can you tell it's my favorite?),  the last film on this video seems to be an experiment in clay and creation.  ""Adam"" is fairly simple.  A male figure is created by  live-action hands and wanders a small clay globe looking for something to  do.  The hands of god (the animator) play a dominant role as well. There's  not too much to this short, but it is worth watching at least a couple of  times.
Overall this video is filled with fun and laughter and meaning.  ""Not without my handbag"" isn't for the small kids, but it  certainly would entertain older children and your over-active inner child.  If you liked W&G or ""Chicken Run,"" then buy this  collection--you won't be disappointed.",962236800,36,3297,4.582037996545768
904041,5,6304646100,Nick Park is brilliant.  I was first introduced to him through Creature Comforts.  It makes for a great chuckle.  Pay special attention to what the animals say and what is going on in the background of each interview.  Very  clever!,952473600,5,232,4.7
904148,2,6304646100,I have Creature Comforts on VHS and was considering getting it on DVD.  That is until I saw the price.  $35.99 for a half hour of animated shorts?  This seems a bit extreme to me.  I see that it's out of print so that might have something to do with it.  The best skit on there by far is the Creature Comforts and it's only 5 minutes long.  Hardly worth it if you ask me.  Hopefully the original Creature Comforts skit makes its way to one of the Creature Comforts series DVDs as an extra.,1128384000,4,489,4.08421052631579
904149,5,6304646100,"Fairing only 32 minutes long, I was worried that these shorts would be cheap, unexciting, and overall just a few animals talking about life at a local Zoo.  While I had no problems with this, I wanted more ... and guess what?  This short DVD provided it.  Not only does it give us that unquenchable desire to see British animals talking about life in a Zoo, but it gives us three more additional shorts which only broaden the power that is known as Nick Park.  From those little animals to dynamic storytelling to becoming a staple in the stop-motion animation field, you can literally see the impact of these shorts in today's cinema.  From just a short 32 minutes, I witnessed the power of Tim Burton (apparently borrowed quite a bit from Park on his film The Nightmare Before Christmas) in a little short called ""Not Without My Handbag"", the creation of life on this planet (as seen through Park's eyes) and even a little ditty about the Middle Ages.  All of these continue to prove that Park was developing powerful filmmaking well before his time.

For those that perhaps haven't been introduced to a show called Wallace & Gromit, I would highly suggest seeing where Park's Claymation has gone from these creative beginnings, but for those that want to see his early efforts (which were rewarded with an Oscar!) , than I suggest Creature Comforts.  More of a observation on our society than just some random cartoons jumping on screen, we watch as animals in a Zoo react the same as we would if we were caged daily (as if we aren't already).  The short that impressed me the most was ""Not Without My Handbag"" where the simple misunderstanding of a contract pulled a darkened cloud over a family.  It is deeply disturbing, but powerfully imaginative and vibrant.  The final short also impressed me with its powerful references to the ""Creation"".  Simply titled ""Adam"", we watch as this naked man tries to adapt to living alone on a unexplored planet.  If the religious references to Adam & Eve weren't blazin enough, we are privy to a final moment where we think ""Adam"" will finally get the companion that he deserves ... only to find out it is something that nobody expected.

Park has this amazing ability to take images from our day to day society and juxtaposition them into the world of the imaginative and unbelievable.  The ability to give these Zoo creatures enough life to feel just like normal humans while being caged behind bars is incredible.  I do not believe anyone has come close to recreating the effect that Nick Park has done.  The closest that comes to mind is Brad Bird with his recent creation of the superhero family dynamic in The Incredibles.  That was smart and enlightening at the same time.  That is what Park creates.  His animation is not just creatures falling on the floor for young children to react, but instead intelligent, rather symbolic, metaphors about life, which appeal to both children and adults.  To create those characters that are able to cross that boundary from children to adult is difficult, but Park seems to have accomplished it with the greatest of ease.

Overall, I thought this was a great introduction to the work of master animator Nick Park.  As I patiently wait for his Wallace & Gromit film release, it is fun to revisit his early work and witness a bold new birth of animation.  I am surprised more films haven't been released using this style of cartoonery.  In a way I am happy because I would hate to see too much over-dominate the Hollywood community, but we need to see more than what has been handed to us in the theaters.  With duds like Madagascar and Home on the Range, I would have thought that Park's work would be the logical next step, but I am always wrong.  I applaud your work Park, and suggest that anyone willing to laugh, chuckle, and be entertained for a great 32 minutes should check out this DVD!

My favorites from great to least:

1. ""Not Without My Handbag""

2. ""Creature Comforts""

3. ""Wat's Pig""

4. ""Adam""

Grade: ***** out of *****",1124323200,2,4025,4.647807637906648
904150,4,6304646100,"I have been a big fan of Park's claymation work, and it really broke the mold when the Wallace & Gromit and other works started to hit the screen.

""Creature Comforts"" is the best of these, in terms of the supposed interviews with zoo animals.  The mountain lion is hilarious, and the creatures all have such human like emotions and even their subtle actions are fantastic.

""Wat's Pig"" had its moments, and I also liked ""Not Without My Handbag.""

There are some others out there I'd still like to find, like the BBC Radio announcer who lives in his studio.",1109116800,,557,4.54
904151,4,6304646100,"I love this DVD! The stories are a little odd but I found them all to be entertaining. As previously stated in other reviews this may not be the best choice for children. The title short ""creature comforts"" is great. The animal voices and interviews give great insight on what animals in zoos might really say if they could talk. ""Wats pig"" adds a little twist on the traditional prince and the pauper story and gets its point across without using dialogue. ""Not without my handbag"" is my personal favorite. The story is about a young girl's aunt who loses her soul to the devil through the purchase of a washer but she refuses to rest in peace until she gets her beloved handbag. Last but not least is ""Adam"" who just cannot seem to catch any luck and resides on the moon alone. I do not think these shorts sit in the same realm as Wallace and Gromit but definitely leave their own mark when it comes to clay animation. If you would like to preview the show creature comforts check comedy centrals listings the show has multiple times all this March 2005.",1107302400,,1056,4.448453608247423
904152,4,6304646100,"""Creature Comforts"" is quite possibly the perfect animated short film; charming, funny, well-animated and just a little bit messy. Using real people's testimonies, the film depicts zoo animals talking about their living conditions. Everyone I have ever shown this to has loved it, young or old. Although its lacking in extras and the rest of the films are not as compelling, this DVD is worth buying just to have a copy of the title track.",1101427200,3,439,4.866666666666666
904153,2,6304646100,"Any fan of Nick Park and Aardman studio would expect so much from a dvd like this which unfortunately disappoints badly in all respects.

Beware!!!!! The dvd consists ONLY four short films from aardman. Other than the ever popular, groundbreaking short claymation ""creature comforts"" which also won Nick Park his very first academy award, there's ""wat's pig"", academy award nominated ""adam"" and ""not without my handbag"". The running time of the disc is barely half an hour. Forget about any extras on the disc, the sound and picture quality is just not of a dvd.

There's much much more about three time academy award winner Nick Park and Aardman studio than just these four shorts! Those who have a multiregion dvd player or watch dvds from different region on their pc, have a brilliant option of buying a dvd named ""AARDMAN CLASSICS"" from region 2 (also available from AMAZON.CO.UK). It has an astounding 31 (yes!!!!) short films by Aardman, including the four mentioned earlier. It also includes a behind the scenes commentary and directors and animators biographies. It is a real complete collection of award winning short films from aardman studio on one dvd.

Inspite of the four great films it consists, ""creature comforts"" dvd is just not worth your money. Getting ""wallace and gromit"" or ""chicken run"" on dvd would be a much better idea.",1094601600,20,1347,4.951327433628318
904154,5,6304646100,"I first saw Creature Comforts as a fill in on PBS. Many years have passed and I still recall the polar kid asking if it was ok to eat the interviewer.
The juxtaposition of the creatures of our Earth having such a clear image of human (and arn't they) lives is beautiful.
Seemingly trapped to the day and yet somewhat content in their memory of what has, might have, or may be.
Lovely! Thanks, Nick.",1089072000,2,398,4.32
904155,3,6304646100,"While ""CC"" and ""Adam"" are modern masterpieces, it seems the other, weaker shorts included on this release are merely there to pad out the DVD. Still, the price is very reasonable",1082592000,2,178,4.774193548387097
904156,3,6304646100,"From Aardman Animation Studios, creators of Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run, come four wonderful animation shorts.
The first, Creature Comforts, winner of the 1990 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, is cute, as various zoo animals are interviewed on what it's like to live in a zoo.  This one contained some of the funniest moments of the four shorts on this disc.  This short runs about 6 minutes.
The second short, Wat's Pig, is a story of two brothers born into nobility and separated at a young age, one becoming the ruler of a kingdom, and the other a poor peasant, and what happens when a neighboring kingdom decides to declare war.  This one runs about 11 minutes.
The third short, Not Without My Handbag, is a darkly humorous tale, which is, as other reviewers put it, in a rather different style of animation than the other three shorts.  The style and story line reminded me a lot of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Due to the darker humor of the subject matter here, it may not be appropriate for younger viewers.  This one runs about 11 minutes.
The final short, Adam, is a funny look at the first being created, and the problems he must face in a rather limited environment.  This one runs approximately 6 minutes.
In all, there is about 35 minutes of material here (no extras), and even at a seemingly lower price, one must consider if it's worth the money.  I did enjoy all the shorts, but I do wish they could have included more, even if it meant a higher cost.  I would have liked seen these included as extras on either a Wallace and Gromit or Chicken Run DVD, but to release so few on one DVD seems a little wasteful.  I feel like I've just had the appetizer, and now I am waiting for the entree.",1074902400,9,1733,4.455696202531645
904157,2,6304646100,"While considerable time and money were spent producing the four short films presented on this DVD, very little went into producing the DVD itself - and it shows.
Individually, the four shorts are nice, although the vocal tracks are muddy and overpowered by the musical soundtrack in places. Closed captions or subtitles would have been helpful, but they aren't included.
Unfortunately, you can't watch the features individually. Even though there is a ""Play All"" option on the menu screen, if you start with ""Creature Comforts"" all four shorts will play.
""Creature Comforts"" is the best of the four, but because of the poor sound it also suffers the most. With no commentary track or making-of bonus feature the irony of the interviews (talking with kids about zoos and seniors about retirement homes) is lost.
""Wat's Pig"" - with its minimal dialogue - comes across nicely, although the parallel storylines can be hard for younger viewers to follow. As with all four of the films a commentary or making-of feature would have been nice.
""Not Without My Handbag"" has a good Tim Burton-esque style, but unless you're prepared to discuss the afterlife, the underworld, or the intricacies of contract law, it's not really appropriate for younger viewers. This is where the individual-play bug in the main menu is most apparent, as you have to manually stop the DVD after ""Wat's Pig"" (or hit the Skip button) to avoid this one.
""Adam"" is my second favorite, and with its minimalist soundtrack it comes across the best of the four. Yes, there is cartoonish nudity. No, it doesn't conform to the Biblical chain of events. Nevertheless, it is a very witty story with three or four big laughs in its brief play time.
Ultimately, this DVD is worth less than the sum of its parts. Wait for something better to come along.",1073692800,2,1809,4.857605177993528
904217,3,6304646100,"This DVD is good, but only has four shorts on it. The Aardman Classics DVD (region 2 only) has these four shorts plus around 22 more! So that one has other shorts like ""Next"" and ""War Story"" which have not been released on DVD in the U.S. (yet). I don't know why they didn't release that here instead of just a fraction of it.

904218,3,6304646100,"This collection of pre-""Chicken Run"" and ""Wallace and Gromit"" cartoons by Nick Park and Peter Lord (for Aardman Animation) is something of a mixed bag. There are two genuine masterpieces, a complete misfire, and a slightly mediocre one.
""Creature Comforts"" is the best short here. It's a wonderful mockumentary where animals in the zoo are interviewed about how much they like their atmosphere. ""Not Without My Handbag"" is the second best, a brilliant weird short about a woman who's come back from hell to retrieve her handbag. ""Adam"" is the third best. It's a short about the first man on Earth (an anatomically correct Adam). While some of Adam's bits of business are amusing, it's not as interesting a piece as it should be. Last and least is ""Wat's Pig"", a very dull story about seperated twins (one of them has the title pig. That pig is the short's main asset.)
The DVD has plenty of wear and tear and the colours look a little muted. The picture is, however, pretty sharp. ""Creature Comforts"" is letterboxed (1.85:1). There are no extras, but that's not surprising.",1046649600,2,1073,4.805405405405406

While the title film ""Creature Comforts"" is entertaining, the other three films really didn't measure up. I know this was done well before most of the Wallace and Gromit work, but it doesn't stand up very well on its own. If they would have had some ""Making Of..."" special features talking about how the techniques led to W&G or Chicken Run, I could have enjoyed it quite a lot.

It's too bad they didn't put out a ""Best of Nick Park"" DVD, with all of the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts, ""Creature Comforts,"" and maybe some of Nick's better commercials. Oh well!",1034726400,4,436,4.4625

My favorite is the Brazilian big cat (panther?) that discusses needing space.  Although the turtles are a close second with their antics in the background.
The other three shorts are watchable, but only so-so. I would not recommend ""Adam"" or ""Not Without My Handbag"" for children.  ""Creature Comforts"" would be okay -- but the humor would most likely be over their heads.  The remaining ""Watt's Pig"" is okay for kids (I guess) but a bit boring for adults.

The prospect of having ""Creature Comforts"" for my own was just irresistable. But I couldn't help but be disappointed with the disc.
It's just that the quality is terrible. The menu is extremely limited and includes no extra features whatsoever. What would have been better than an interview with each of the animators and writers? Or a ""making of"" short? Certainly, there wasn't a problem with having enough space on the disc.
The color filtering problems on the menu page and the monophonic sound terrified me. ""Creature Comforts"" is monophonic, and the rest are in simple stereo.
The picture quality in the shorts is better than on the menu, but not at all up to modern DVD standards. Neither is the sound--two channel stereo. I guess that's because the original material wasn't produced with much of a budge, and it was done a decade ago.
The undercard features were interesting, but didn't appeal to me like Creature Comforts does. I didn't find ""Not Without My Handbag"" as scary as some others did, but I think it's a mistake to buy this disc for children and expect them to get anything from it.

However, I disagree with other(s) (...) who think the 1st short, ""Creature Comforts,"" is not for children. I think kids will enjoy it, and as they grow, understand the many layers of meaning in it. As for the 2nd one - ""Watt's Pig"" - this is perfect for children as it is pure pantomime and set in the middle ages with castles and knights. It also demonstrates good morals. But the main reason why I insist on owning this tape is ... the title short, ""Creature Comforts,"" is one of the best short films of any kind, and frankly I have to have it around just to show people. No matter how many times I've seen that one, it's still great. It's a bogus documentary interviewing animals at the zoo and their perception of how they are treated, and the living conditions. It is brilliant, a work of art.",992649600,5,1162,4.310502283105023
904286,4,6304646100,"I must qualify this - I really like shorts and I love claymation. I had originally seen the contents of this DVD as presented in a local movie theatre as a leader for ""A Close Shave"" (Wallace and Grommit...excellent!). The primary short featured (""Creature Comforts"") is a collection of bits that Park et al did as gas company commercials over the ocean (aka the UK). In processing for the DVD, they took out the sales pitch for each commercial - which I think really took it out of context and left the watcher going ""Why the heck did they do this?"" It takes a collection of excellent commercials and turns them into a sort of unsensical [sic] short. By itself, I would give the DVD a 3-star - when used as a leader into another Park movie, I would give it a 5-star. I'll settle for a compromise...but still give it a recommendation to others. Enjoy!",987984000,,851,4.461538461538462
904572,5,6304646100,"""Creature Comforts"" is a must have. You must own this. Especially if you are an animator. This is absolutley the most stylish collection of animated shorts I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. There is a impeccable attention to detail in each and every one of these pieces. I love the Aardman style and I personally believe this distinct style is unimitatable. If you enjoyed ""Chicken Run"" and ""Wallace and Gromit"" you need to own this video. Buy it,if for no other reason than to see ""Adam"" the cartoon that started the Aardman empire.",985564800,2,540,4.6947368421052635

This DVD is worth getting just for ""Creature Comforts"" and ""Not Without my Handbag"". The rest of the short claymation films are OK, but not worth watching more than a few times-- and don't be fooled, it's not for kids, some of the themes are pretty dark. Otherwise, this collection of short claymations is worth it for the price, and if you like other Aardman Animations (Wallace & Gromit, Chicken Run), you will definitely enjoy this DVD.",983577600,,541,4.827956989247312
904574,2,6304646100,"After getting this home, I was a bit disappointed with the stories that make up the four cartoons. ""Not Without My Handbag"" almost makes this dvd worth its value, but this collection has precious little of the whimsy and flavor that made ""Chicken Run"" enjoyable.

904575,4,6304646100,"I have the video version of 'Creature Comforts' and it's one of my all time favorites.  There are four shorts, all from Aardman Studios--home of the famed Nick Park, creator of Wallace and Gromit.
The first short is called Creature Comforts, and is the only one to fully reflect Nick Park's style and humor.  It's hilarious and the details are wonderful.  The british accents can get a bit tough to understand at times, but it's worth watching over and over to get the full meaning and catch all the little jokes.
There are three other shorts, each with a completely different style and sensibility, and all of them displaying master level animation and brilliant attention to detail.  My favorite of the other three is 'Not Without My handbag'-- the animation style is completely different than the other three, and the story is hilarious, in a film noir/black comedy kind of way.
If you love Wallace and Gromit, are a fan of animation in general, or love dry british wit...you'll love Creature Comforts. Enjoy!",982627200,9,1012,4.832369942196531

Yes she is a bit turned off by the Devil in ""Not Without My Handbag"" but it is not done in any type of overly scary way either.....He is a salesman at a washing machine company with a french accent. I do understand that some children are more spookable than others so keep that in mind, but overall it is a very good collection of shorts. I highly recommend for any fans of Chicken Run or Wallace and Gromit!",982540800,,530,4.105769230769231

As an American, I had a little difficulty understanding the British accents. Multiple viewing helps. Overall the DVD runs about 30 minutes. The 6 minute 'Creature Comforts' is the best of the four. Even at a low price this DVD is pushing the value envelope. It's not worth it unless you absolutely love Nick Park animation and have to have it in your collection.",982281600,,497,4.790697674418604
904578,5,6304646100,"Anything from the Aardman studios is always welcome and this is no exception.  It is an inexpensive offering of four of their 'minor' works.
I really can't add anything to the other complimentary reviews given here...  ...except to say that if you go to amazon.co.uk you'll find a DVD there called 'Aardman Classics' which contains over two and a half hours of stuff including everything on this one, plus a 64 page book (which barely squeezes into the box) with lots of background information!  It costs more but is definitely worth the money.",979084800,7,544,4.827956989247312
904579,4,6304646100,"This DVD includes four shorts from the company that produced the Wallace & Gromit shorts. These are:
1) Creature Comforts - directed by Nick Park, this short is only five minutes long. It is a funny concept: animals are interviewed at a zoo, and they talk about the advantages and drawbacks of captivity. This, however, gives no space to the excellent action scenes that charactherize Park's best work. It is just the animals talking in front of the microphone.
2) Wat's Pig - this one narrates the story of two brothers separated at birth: one ends as king, the other is raised by a pig. There is no payoff here at the end.
3) Not without my handbag - this one is weird, in the line of Beetlejuice. Some people say it is a little scary for small children. I don't think is scarier than other cartoons in TV. This is the funnier of the lot.
4) Adam - a small (and naked) man in a small planet, ""a la The Little Prince"", while his creator (God) works on him. Interesting, and more in line with the visual humor that we expect.
Somes notes regarding the price. Ten dollars sounds cheap for a DVD disc but consider that it is only 35 minutes long, it is not close captioned and lacks any extras. The transference, as noted by other reviewers, is not great (while maybe better than VHS, but that is expected).
I will recommend this disc only to the die hard fans of clay animation.",978307200,52,1377,4.3828125

""Creature Comforts"" is a hilarious short about the quirks of living in the zoo. The way the different animals banter about their situations is sure to make you laugh. It's a great short. The rest of the shorts on the DVD - ""Wat's Pig"", ""Not Without My Handbag"" and ""Adam"" - are also very humorous but not as much as ""Creature Comforts"". The DVD has zip in the Special Features department. I would have loved to have seen a documentary on the making of the short, commentary, test footage or any other assorted feature.

The problem with this tape I have is the other films. The only one I actually liked was not without my handbag. I love how dark it is. it reminds me of a tim burton film. I love the dark story line and the awesome animation. I would not recommend this tape if you're just a Wallace and gromit fan. you will most likely be disappointed.

7875175,4,6304646100,"This set of short films is uneven, but the good stories are very good indeed.  All of it is in claymation, whereby models are manipulated in separate pictures to make motion.  Here, they are learning their craft and playing with stories and characterizations.

By far my favorite are the interviews with animals in a zoo.  Most all have voices like low middle class brits, with a hilarious juxtaposition of concerns, like young polar bears, worrying about animals in the wild missing meals, conclude that they are better taken care of in the zoo.  The best is the Brazilian leopard, who complains in a wonderful accent that he is stuck on an island with little range and essentially dog food.  There is also a good one about a medieval twins separated at birth.  For the rest, they are not so good, often far more crude than we have come to expect from this excellent team.

7875177,4,6304646100,"A lot of these reviewers seem to be preoccupied with whether these shorts are appropriate for children, never mind that these skits are brilliant. ""Adam"" seems to be a funny minimalist take on existentialism; it's a wonderful exercise in economy and brainy physical humor. ""Wat's Pig"" is a lovely prince and pauper tale with some of the prettiest ""pop classical"" music I've heard in animation, recalling Beethoven's pastoral 6th symphony in mood. The piece has a lot of atmosphere and makes me happy. ""Creature Comforts"" is deservedly famous for its animated spin on real life dialogue. The Handbag sketch is my least favorite, and to be honest I haven't watched it in awhile. Still, some of these are amongst the very best animated shorts.
