2292107,1,B0009IC4K2,"I have ordered from this ""company"" before. How does Amazon allow them to even sell this very bad 'boot leg' dvd. The video quality TERRIBLE, and the audio... TERRIBLE!! I would never bad mouth anyone trying to make a living but this ""company"" is stealing for a living. Dont get took.",1148947200,2,283,4.568627450980392

8061208,5,B0009IC4K2,"I own this music DVD, but my tracks are different than what i read, also he's flashing a  watch & rings, with hat on backwards, NOT holding dice as seen here!
track listings: country grammar, e.i., ride wit me, batter up, hot in herre, dilemma, air force ones, midwest swings, + more!
while the cover & songs are different, i still rated this music videos DVD a 5 (EXCELLENT).",1280966400,3,376,4.449275362318841

THANX AND I WOULD RECOMEND THIS DVD.",1249430400,,127,3.7037037037037037
8061210,3,B0009IC4K2,It looks like this is a copy of a copy.  Not the best visually.,1247443200,,63,3.5
8061211,2,B0009IC4K2,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this-so I was somewhat prepared. However, almost all of the videos except the Gang Starr videos are cut down. It does not make sense to show 30 seconds of a video. I bought this DVD for the Heavy D videos,some of which can not be bought on ITunes. Out of about 9 Heavy D videos, only 3 are almost full length. This DVD is very disappointing. I will have to buy the full length HEAVY D videos on Itunes now anyway. I like Gang Starr, but it is possible to buy their videos on DVD on Amazon anyway. So if you want to buy whole videos rather than clips, SKIP THIS DVD.",1243728000,,604,4.084033613445378
8061212,3,B0009IC4K2,"After seeing such a negative review, I was very hesitant to buy it. A lot of the videos are very hard to find, and I do like every artist on it. Most of the videos by Black Moon I couldn't even remember, and Buckshot is one of my favorite artists. I especially wanted this for one of the Heavy D. videos, but I won't say which one (Big Lez). There were issues which I'll describe below. Cons- A lot of the videos were edited short. Some only go a minute or two, while others seem to play all the way through or close to it. Some of the videos didn't even have video or the video stopped playing, only the music played. Gangstar's ""You Know My Steez"" didn't have any video, and 50 Cent's ""This How We Do"" video cut off just past 3 minutes. I didn't watch every video yet, but the ones that I did, played fine. Pros-Considering some of the videos by Heavy, Black Moon, and Gangstar are 10-20 years old, I thought they played just fine. I didn't have any audio problems either. I know my stereo was bumpin' them. If you are hardcore fans of any of the artists, I actually think you'll like how most of them are edited, again save the Cons that I mentioned. I know the Black Moon stuff had my neck about to fall off. The dvd info on this site says 90 minutes, but it was closer to 110 minutes, athough I think Heavy D's ""Nothing But Love"" was recorded twice.",1200009600,,1354,4.17175572519084
8061213,1,B0009IC4K2,"I like Nelly, but it was not what I wanted to order and was not waht the site seller said it was. Nelly's videos are Iz U, Na-na na-na, My Place, Tilt Ya Head, Call On Me, Shake Ya Tail Feather, All Night Long, Tip Drill, Over & Over, and Luv Me Baby but on the amazon page for Nelly music videos it says DVD Tracks: Country Grammar, E.I., Ride With Me, Batter Up, Hot In Herre, Dilemma, Air Force Ones, Midwest Swing, and more. Nothing about Mya. Only wanted Nelly Videos. Mya's Videos are Best of Me, Free, Ghetto Superstar, It's All About Me, Movin' On, Movin' Out, My First Night with You, Somebody Like Me, and Take Me There. Shipping was 5 star & it was 2 Day Shipping.",1184889600,5,675,4.1603053435114505
8061214,4,B0009IC4K2,"It is a decent bootleg, but it does not have Summer Bunnies on it, which was the reason I ordered it, did not have Friend of Mine and Secret Love.  Misleading.  It did have Gotham City Remix, Lean on Me, Love Angel and Magic Chick, which I needed.  I liked it, but I had the majority of the videos.  I got a video with a different picture cover too.  I just wishe the sellers would give what you pay for, exactly what it says.  I love R. Kelly.",1173657600,7,444,3.9886363636363638
