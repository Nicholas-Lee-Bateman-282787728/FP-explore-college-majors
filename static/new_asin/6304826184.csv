Plus Pantera and Taka are retarts. I don't have to go in to  details about the thrid and fourth match because they just sucked. The War  of Attrition was o.k. Vader vs. Kane was just o.k because it is so clear  that Vader was going to lose. But the unsanctioned match rocks. Trash  cans, tables, even barbed wire, but the best part is when Austin Stuned  Chyna",924134400,,518,4.468085106382978
932343,4,6304826184,"I think this ppv was good enough to get buy. I am an avid wwf fan. I think No Way Out was worth buying. The first match(Headbangers and Mero/Goldust) was good as well as the Jarret and Bradshaw match. Sable did some butt  kicking. The Kane vs. Vader was really good and the eight man tag match was  great. Yeah, sometime in the middle of the ppv it got soft put picked up at  the end. Sometimes people tell thier honest opinion and I think that this  ppv is worth seeing.",915494400,,471,4.142857142857143
932543,5,6304826184,"This was a really good ppv. In fact, one of the best in 2001. There were high profile matches that everyone was looking to see.

1)Big Show v. Raven (WWF Hardcore title): This was an o.k. match to start the night off with. Of course, Big Show was the favorite, but during the match, Billy Gunn, Steve Blackmen, Crash, Hardcore Holly interfered. Big Show still came out on top.

2)Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, X-Pac, & Chris Jericho (WWF I.C. Title): This match was a pretty good match. There was a lot of action and the match went back and forth.

3)Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley v. Trish Stratus: This was one match many were waiting to see. With a great storyline and with these two fighting all the time, no one could wait to see this match. Stephanie & Trish never wrestled that much so people really didn't know what to expect from them. In the end, it turned out to be a great match.

4)Stone Cold v. Triple H (2 out of 3 falls: 1st fall is a regular wrestling match, 2nd fall is a street fight, 3rd fall is a Cage): These two had a great storyline going and a lot of intense action had occured before this match. Everyone knew it would go to a 3rd fall but no one knew how far these two would take it. They went back and forth; using weapons and just beating the crap out of each other. I was very suprised at some of the things that happened during this match. This one match is the reason why you should buy this movie.

5)Jerry ""the king"" Lawler v. Steven Richards: Now i'm a fan of ""The Kings"", but this wasn't that good of a match. It was just a way to get Lawler to have a match.

6)Edge & Christian v. Dudleys v. Undertaker & Kane (table match foe WWF Tag Team Titles): I sort of like this match. I feel that the Undertaker & Kane are just out of league for the Dudleys and Edge & Christian. And they didn't even win the match. Not a good move!

7)Kurt Angle v. The Rock (WWF Title): This was a good match until Big Show got involved. There was really no reason for him to. But still, it was a good match. One of the best WWF title matches i've seen. They didn't have to use weapns or make each other bleed to get the crowd into it.

Overall, this was one of the best WWF ppvs in 2001!",1226275200,,2197,4.152941176470589
932544,5,6304826184,"This was during the height of WWF Attitude in February 2001 and this was a great card. It was actually better than The Royal Rumble that took place a month earlier. Because they were still WWF at this point, I will refer to them as such for this review. Here is what went down:

The Big Show Vs. Raven (WWF Hardcore Match) - Nothing spectacular other than to show how dangerous TBS could be in this environment. Other wrestlers make their appearance but Show pretty much dominates this one.

Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Eddie Guerrero Vs. X-Pac (Fatal Fourway Match for the WWF I-C Title) - WWF/WWE style three ways and four ways can range from okay to suck to pretty good to above average to excellent. I would rank this one in the above average category! Then again, how could it not be with the Stu Hart trained Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit and the now-legend that is Eddie Guerrero. Even X-Pac brought his A-game for this one! I would also say this is one of the more brutal 4 ways I've ever seen with just....wrestling! Benoit even dusted off his old ""Dragon Suplex"" (Full Nelson Suplex) for this one while Eddie brought back his ""brainbuster"" for this match! Ends when Jericho gets in a quick pin on X-Pac who had Benoit down for his own pin but couldn't capitalize. Excellent I-C title match!

Stephanie McMahon Vs. Trish Stratus - Now, put this into prespective. Stephanie will NEVER be accused of being a great female wrestler. For someone that wasn't watching WWF/WWE at that time, one would look at this and say ""Trish will kill Steph!"" but keep in mind Trish was a rookie herself and wasn't nearly the performer she became later in 2001 thru 2006. With that in mind, this match turned out better than anticipated! I know I was expecting it to suck! Ends when William Regal's interference backfires in favor of Steph and she gets the pin. This match led to the now infamous ""strip down and bark like a dog"" incident with Trish and Vince that took place a few weeks after this match.

Triple H Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (Special 2 out of 3 match) - In this one, the falls had special stipulations to them. The first was a regular match, the second was a street fight while the final match (if needed) was to take place in a cage! For those that haven't seen this, this more than made up for their Survivor Series 2000 match! I'll admit, at that time, I expected this one to suck booty even with two of the top guys involved but it ended up great! You really believed that not only would they do anything to win, they would be willing to die themselves to get their hands raised!

It goes all three falls by the way. I won't tell you who wins (you probably know already) but its worth the 40 plus minutes to watch! This match is also on the recently released ""Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin"" DVD that came out back earlier this year.

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler Vs. Stevie Richards - Filler match with the silly stipulation that if Lawler won, The Kat would get naked on the PPV! If he lost, Kat would have to join Right To Censor! Of course, you knew the heels would win this! Even McMahon isn't that crazy!

The Undertaker/Kane Vs. Edge/Christian Vs. The Dudley Boyz (WWF World Tag Team Title Tables Match) - We know E & C and The Dudley Boyz could go in this type of bout but ""The Dead Man"" and ""The Big Red Machine"" did pretty well here too! Ends when 'Taker and Kane have the match won but the team of Rikishi and Meng interfer and give the Dudley's the win with a 3D on (I think) Christian. I do know The Dudleys (Team 3D today in TNA) retained their titles.

The Rock Vs. Kurt Angle (WWF World Title Match) - This is when I really started respecting Angle. In a losing effort, he really took it to the Rock to prove he wasn't the proverbial ""transitional champion."" He also unleashed for the first time on PPV his now famous anklelock which nearly won him the match against ""The Great One!"" The Rock used some surprising wrestling as well with a superplex, sharpshooter and even a belly to belly suplex! Ends after two Rock Bottoms on Angle to get the win!

Overall, if you still have a functional VHS player, this tape is worth getting! The seller prices are pretty good! Worth getting!",1225756800,,4216,4.408740359897172
932545,4,6304826184,"There was a lot going on with WWF.  The Monday Night Wars ended almsot a year before.  The WCW/ECW Alliance had been vanquished.  Ric Flair returned to the WWF.  And the least likely of champions was a miserable wreck whose insecurities drove him to succeed, and tick fans off in the process.

There's a lot going on with this PPV, too.  Triple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley just ended their TV relationship.  WWF ""co-owners"" Ric Flair and Vince McMahon made each other's lives a living hell.  And one of them in a desparate act brought back the New World Order.

**************************************************

First off, the nWo comes out to kick off the show.  I'm not gonna get into the debate of whether bringing this faction to the Fed was good or not.  But I will say that Hollywood Hogan, Scott Hall, & Kevin Nash cut a promo that was surprising & heartfelt, even though their speeches proved false by th4 PPV's end.  Nothing great, but still worth the airtime.

----------------------------------

1) Tag Team Turmoil
Scotty 2 Hotty & Albert v. Christian & Lance Storm
v. The Hardy Boyz v. The Dudley Boyz v. Billy & Chuck v. The APA
---The stipulation here was that the winners would get a shot at the Tag Titles for WRESTLEMANIA X-8.  Although this eventually became hogwash (four of these teams ended up in the 'MANIA match), this opener remains an exciting kickoff.  What you want from matches like these are fast-paced action, a variety of performances, and good time length.  You get all of that here.  Each team puts on a good show yet loses (or wins) in a believable fashion.
""7.5 / 10""

----------------------------------

2) Goldust v. Rob Van Dam
---These two men are as creative and innovative with their in-ring talents as any other WWE superstar.  Both men utiltized intersting counters, and couple of ""OUCH!"" moves.  Frankly, I don't understand why some reviewers aren't into this one.  The Milwaukee crowd seemed to be into the match.  No, this isn't the greatest match I've ever seen.  But it's as solid as a rock, and one of the most underrated PPV contests in recent memory.
""7.0 / 10""

----------------------------------

3) Tag Team Championships
Booker T & Test v. Tazz & Spike Dudley (champions)
---Okay, let's call a spade ""a spade"".  This match is as dull as it looks on paper.  I've never been a huge Tazz or Spike fan, which doesn't help.  I mean, I can't stomach how this combo ever won a match together.  Booker T & Test make a good team, and I wish I got to see them work more.  But the problem is that either the champs are getting beaten mercilessly, or pull off unbelievable feats out of nowhere.  Because the match is kept to a fairly quick pace, it's never boring.  Just don't expect a believable match.
""5.5 / 10""

----------------------------------

4) Brass-Knux-On-A-Pole Match
Intercontinental Championship
Edge v. William Regal (champion)
---The third consecutive PPV showing between these two, and easily the best.  I'm not a fan of their VENGEANCE showdown, but their ROYAL RUMBLE match was very good.  When Regal was healthy, he came up with unique, sitff offense that I loved.  And Edge...is there anything I need to say?  He's always been great, but 2002 was his best year to date.  Even Matt Hardy admits that he's an excellent in-ring performer.  Both men use some traditional ground grappling, and eventually some ""pole psychology"".  There are especially a lot of apron spots, too.  This is a good example of a slow burn, where you get a tad exhausted just watching the wrestlers work.  This match is so good, it might increase Regal's seemingly small fan base.
""7.5 / 10""

----------------------------------

5) The Undertaker v. The Rock
---To my complete surprise, I was incredibly bored with this one.  Taker was a terrific heel because he was just a bullying S.O.B., and The Rock continued to use more than his signature moves.  But something was just off this time.  Maybe it was because the fight was too wild for its own good.  Rock & Taker brawl all over ringside, which I usually don't care for.  And when they're in the ring, Taker dominates most of the time.  I dunno, maybe I need to rewatch this one again.  But I'm not looking forward to it.  And what's with Taker's Limp Bizkit song being edited out of the DVD?  Aren't they ""The WWE's Favorite Band?""
""5.5 / 10""

----------------------------------

6) Winner Goes To WRESTLEMANIA X-8
Guest Referee - Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley
Kurt Angle v. Triple H
---Again, this event isn't good for the reasons I expected.  I expected this to be a classic among classics.  The last time these three were in a storyline (2000), we got to see some excellent matches.  But this time, I liked what I saw, but didn't love it.  HHH & Angle complement each other very well, and Stephanie's role as a refere never get boring.  There are so many ways this one could've gone wrong, but these three avoid them.  Where they slip up is putting on a classic they're capable.  You see all of the signature moves, the counters, and the guest referee spots...but there's not much originality in any of it.  The only original aspect of the match was the finish, but WWF dropped the ball with that days later.  Don't get me wrong: this is a good match, but Angle & HHH have done better.
""7.0 / 10""

----------------------------------

7) Undisputed WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin v. Chris Jericho (champion)
---Just as good (and crazy) as the VENGEANCE main event that catapulted Jericho into WWE history.  Sadly, many fans (myself included) didn't appreciate what an honor it was to see Y2J carry the ball.  He was ahead of his time, but if you give this DVD a look, you'll see just how good he was.  Anyone who's read my reviews knows I'm not a big fan of Steve Austin, but I could watch him face Chris Jericho any time of day.  One of Austin's greatest matches was his 1st title win against Shawn Michaels; well, Jericho is a lot like HBK, so do the math.  What you'll probably remember most about the match (besides nWo interfering) is how much these two guys chop each other.  Even J.R. & Lawler can't believe how much damage is done to both men's chests.  But I digress, this main event is good enough to erase any disappointments I might have with the PPV.
""7.5 / 10""

----------------------------------

This PPV is a solid card from beginning to end.  All the promos, interviews, and backstage shenanigans work.  All the storylines make sense.  And all the matches tell their stories well.  Granted, I didn't care for a few of the stories (underdog Tag champs, for example), but my quibbles are a matter of personal taste.  NO WAY OUT 2002 is definitely worth buying if you haven't seen it yet.

DVD Note - Why in the world are the entrance themes for RVD, Tazz, & Undertaker changed?",1220227200,,6803,4.723168654173765
932546,4,6304826184,"This is the first ever Pay Per View of wrestling that I ever watched. I must say, I was impressed by the card now that I look at it 6 years later. I loved seeing Hulk Hogan come back to the WWF after seeing him in numerous WWF old school videos. Many people say it was a bad ppv, but those are their opinions. I think this was a pretty good show. Rock vs Taker was match of the night in my book. Quite possibly HHH vs Angle was also. Jericho vs Austin could've been better, but was ended early w/ the nWo invasion again. All in all, good show.",1217894400,,543,3.9454545454545453
932547,5,6304826184,"An old vhs tape that I found in my collection which was the 2001 edition of No Way Out. Most of the feuds here continued on the road to WrestleMania X7 but this event offers so much more. Stone Cold Steve Austin & Triple H would finally have the chance to settle their feud once & for all while The Rock has set his sights on dethroning Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship.

Hardcore Champion Raven vs The Big Show. Before the match got underway, there was this ""ninja"" woman that actually attempted to attack the Big Show before he got to the ring until Raven came from behind with a trash can. From there, Show just dominated Raven before the 24/7 rule of the hardcore title was used to full potential with moments like Billy Gunn coming out & winning the title before Raven won it back, Crash dressed up as a popcorn vender before getting taken out, Hardcore Holly & Steve Blackman double-teaming Show & the sick chokeslam onto the trash can on Raven.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero vs X-Pac. The storyline here was that Jericho was going to be the target of this match as Jericho had taken out Eddie & X-Pac with injuries over the past few months while Jericho also took the title from Benoit at the last PPV along with the fact that Benoit & Guerrero promised to work together. This was just non-stop action from the opening bell with each man getting a chance to shine including moments where Benoit & Guerrero were conflicted with helping each other & trying to win the match until it was one mistake that allowed Jericho to ""sneak out the back door"" as Jim Ross put it.

Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs Trish Stratus. After months of these two divas being at each other's throats, they finally clashed here with the added comedy of Vince McMahon wanting Commissioner Regal to do the right thing...even though he had no clue what that meant. This was a better match than anybody expected as it never got dull & boring & there was enough to keep you entertained whether it was comedy, catfighting or even both divas doing some impressive moves in the ring. The ending came with William Regal doing what he felt was the right thing to do.

3 Stages Of Hell: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Triple H. The first fall would be a Singles match, the second fall would be a Street Fight while the third fall would be contested in a Steel Cage. The build-up was really something coming into this match as it was build as the final encounter between these two. This was the match of the year of 2001 as voted by fans as these two just beat the hell out of each other to the point where they left the viewer exhausted. No words can do this match any justice as the carnage just speaks for itself & without question the best Austin/HHH match.

Steven Richards vs Jerry Lawler. Tazz joined Jim Ross at the announce position for this match & the rest of the night. This match had two stipulations with The Kat being involved as if Steven won, The Kat would have to join the Right To Censor while if Lawler won, the Kat would be allowed to get naked. This was just an average match with karma playing a factor against The King but for those keeping track, the result of this match was due to Lawler quitting the WWF at the time due to Kat being fired.

Tables Match: WWF Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz vs Edge & Christian vs The Undertaker & Kane. The beginning of this match pretty much summoned up what this match was going to be like as Taker & Kane were the dominate monsters as they threw the Dudleys off the stage from the opening bell & set their sights on getting revenge on Edge & Christian before the Dudleys came back with some vicious chairshots. Along with cameos from Rikishi & Haku, this was a pretty good match to watch for what it was.

WWF Champion Kurt Angle vs The Rock. Kurt came into this match with a much more aggressive attitude than we have seen before while this was one of the rare times that we have seen The Rock use his whole wrestling library to combat with Angle. There was a brief moment where the Big Show came out & chokeslammed everyone in the ring including the referee but if you saw the build-up to this match, you would see why. With moments like Kurt being too aggressive to the point where he couldn't control his language & if you look closely near the finish, there is a botch count by Earl Hebner, this was a great main event & easily one of the Rock's best ""wrestling"" matches in his career.

In the end, this event delivered more than anyone else had planned on & really got fans pumped up for WrestleMania so this is an event that I recommend going out of your way to get as this was truly one of the best events of 2001...& worth the VHS price.",1208908800,,4727,4.375854214123007
932548,5,6304826184,"1) Hardcore title match Raven vs. Big Show: a nice way to kick off the payperview. all kinds of weapons were used and it really became intense halfway through the match when many superstars began interfering. 8/10
2) Y2J vs. Benoit vs. Guerrero vs. Xpac for i.c title: a magnificant fatal 4 way match that just had non-stop action from beggining to end. a technical masterpiece. 9/10
3) Trish stratus vs. Stephanie Mcmahon-helmsley: suprise match of the night that saw both women literally beat the hell out of each other. a great woman's match. 8/10.

5) jerry lawler vs. steven richards: somehow, unfortunately, i knew that rtc would win this match and i ended up being right. decent match between these two men but nothing worth speaking of. 7/10.
6) dudleys vs. edge & christian vs. undertaker & kane in a triple threat table match for the tag titles: an excellent brawl between these three men, mainly the undertaker and kane who literally beat the s*** out of both teams only to be screwed in the end. 8.5/10.
7) kurt angle vs. the rock for the championship: a hell of a match and the best that i've seen between these two men. big show makes a suprise appearance and the rock ends up going to wrestlemania as champion. 9/10.

All in all, this still remains the greatest no way out as it had something for every wrestling fan to enjoy. definitely worth adding to your collection.",1208649600,,1684,4.5394736842105265
932549,3,6304826184,"The program starts off with people wanted to see, The NWO. The crowd was really silent and it didn't seem like they cared.

Tag Team Turmoil-Something that was frequent on WWF/WWE PPV's in the early 2000's were these matches. Anyways, APA wins a decent match but nothing really speical.

RVD VS Goldust-A pretty good match as RVD shows off all his signature moves. The last few minutes were really well done with RVD missing a frog splash and Dust hitting an awesome DDT. However, in the end RVD hits the 5-star frog splash and wins it.

NWO confronts Austin. They seem to egg him on and offer him beer, i'm sure Hall drank it after Austin didn't accept it. They let him thru and it aburptly ends there as Hall looks like he was about to say something.

WWF Tag Team Champions Tazz and Spike Dudley VS Booker T and Test: The Cinderella story of Tazz and Spike continue with this win. Funny how the ref saw Test use the ropes for leverage even though he was nowhere near the position too see it. Test then gets locked in a tazzmission and quickly taps out.

Rock cuts an promo against Taker, nothing really speical

William Regal VS Edge in a Brass Knuckles on a Pole match: Alot of wrestling writers say pole matches suck. Honestly now I think of it, these matches really don't make much sense. Regal is always fun to watch and i'm not a big fan of Edge. Regal wins with a pair of brass knuckles from his trunk, this was a good match.

Undertaker VS The Rock: For some stupid reason, JR keeps on calling 'Taker Booger Red. A slow paced match and the ending gets confusing. 'Taker sits on his bike for no reason when he could have won and then pulls out a lead pipe after pushing the ref down. Flair hits 'Taker with a pipe, Rock hits the rock bottom and scores a win. Pretty dull match with a stupid finish.

Mr. Pefect live from New York's WWF Resturant. I wish he was on this PPV rather then talking.

Kurt Angle VS Triple H with Stephaine McMahon as guest ref: I hate Triple H and Stephaine for ruining my love for wrestling and probably other fans too. I just skipped over it.

Rock cuts a funny promo on the NWO.

Steve Austin VS Chris Jericho: A very good match as it starts with a brawl on the outside of the ring. The match was good and then the NWO shows up and beats up Austin as Jericho retains the title.

Overall, a decent PPV. The last three matches should have been great but they weren't and were all ruined by outside interference.",1196640000,,2448,4.309368191721133
932550,2,6304826184,"Scott ""Razor Ramon"" Hall, Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash, and ""Hollywood"" Hulk Hogan returned to the WWF under the group known as the nWo.  The nWo for the most part would be involving in the beginning & end of the show along with some backstage segments but for the most part, this PPV was another step on the road to WrestleMania & helped established the programs going into the event.

Tag Team Turmoil Match: This was an average opening match with nothing really memorable about it once it was over.  Everyone put forth a solid opener & got the crowd into it so it served it's purpose.

Rob Van Dam vs. Goldust - RVD's at his best when he's allowed to go fast paced & high flyin' but that wasn't the case here as Goldust had RVD grounded & one the defense for a majority of the match here before pulling off the eventual victory.  This match isn't boring but it's obiviously a filler.

Tag Team Champions Tazz & Spike Dudley vs. Booker T & Test - Tazz & Spike Dudley were again playing the underdog role here against two former teammates in the former WCW/ECW alliance.  Booker T was the main workhorse here & deserves credit for making what would have came off as another dull filler somewhat more entertaining than it would have been.  But again, this was just like the previous match...it came off as nothing more than a filler.

Brass Knuckles On A Pole Match: Intercontinental Champion William Regal vs. Edge - Regal & Edge's styles of wrestling do not clash well together & have produced two boring matches at the two previous PPV's.  This was one match that again bored me.

The Rock vs. Undertaker - These two have a great match here between the two of them as it was pretty much straight up & didn't involve anything extreme like their previous one-on-one PPV encounter (on Undertaker's DVD).  Rock looked dead set on revenge while Undertaker was just beating The Rock down.  The ending involved Ric Flair setting up their match at WrestleMania.

Winner Gets The WrestleMania Title Shot: Triple H vs. Kurt Angle (Special Referee: Stephanie McMahon) - If you've seen one ""special referee"" match where the referee was heavily biases towards one wrestler then you've seen them all & this was no exception here.  The entire focus of this match was Stephanie & Triple H while Kurt Angle played the background character...the same role Jericho would play in the WrestleMania main event the next month.  I'll give it credit here as Stephanie took & delivered some comedic bumps here but she was the entire focus here & it took away from what could have been an awesome contest here just knowing what both men were made of.

Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs. Stone Cold - This was better than their Vengeance matchup but then again, both men started off fresh this time instead of Jericho already wrestling a long match right before.  I don't know what it was about this match but it didn't have the main event feel to it as the crowd wasn't heavily into it & the match itself got real slow & dull at times...which it rarely does during an Austin match.  The ending came when the nWo came out & attacked Austin helping Jericho escape with the titles before spraypainting Austin.

In the end, this was one of those PPV's that is average & watchable but nothing here was memorable except the start of the WWE version of the nWo.  If you can find this really cheap & have some spare bucks then go ahead but otherwise, you can pass.",1180656000,,3426,4.574468085106383

No Way Out was one of the WWE's best ppv's of 2001!!!!

1. WWF Hardcore Championship
Big Show vs. Raven (C)
This was a decent hardcore match, lots of title changes though but the Big Show is the one left standing.
Winner: Big Show 3/5

2. WWF Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho (C) vs. Chris Benoit vs. X-Pac vs. Eddie Guerrero
Good but not great fatal four way. All four men does a great performance.
Winner: Chris Jericho 4/5

3. Trish Stratus vs. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley
In my opinion this was one of the best divas matches in some time. this also had a decent rivalry. The spanking on Trish is funny. match diffantly worth watching a couple of times.
Winner: Stephanie McMahon 3.5/5

4. Best 2-out-of-3 Falls Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H
1st Fall: Pin Fall Only- This was a great 1st fall. Very fierce and good brawling. Stone Cold wins the fall with the Stone Cold Stunner. 4/5
2nd Fall: Street Fight- This was a great street fight much like their match at Survivor Series 2000 but this one has an ending. Also a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire that makes an appearance Triple H gets backdrop through the table but comes back to win with the pedigree after hitting Austin with the sledge hammer. Great Fall best of the three. 4.5/5
3rd Fall: Steel Cage Match- This wasn't the best steel cage match and most likely because it was the third fall. Lots of weapons are left in the cage and Austin and Triple H takes a advantage of them. The ending is right too with Triple H falling on Austin to win after both men hitting each other with the sledge hammer(Triple H) and a 2x4 wrapped in barb wire (Austin). 3.5/5
Winner: Triple H 5/5

Alright tables match Kane and Taker due much of the work until Rikishi and Haku interfers. Christain gets 3D through the table.
Winner: The Dudley Boys 3/5

6. WWF Championship
The Rock vs. Kurt Angle (C)
This is the one on one rematch for the title that the Rock never got until now. This match was very good not as good as their No Mercy match but very watchable. It took 2 Rock Bottoms to put Angle away and The Rock was on the road to WM 17 to face Stone Cold.
Winner: The Rock 4/5

2nd Goldust vs Rob Van Dam

Rob Van Dam was grounded most of the match as Goldust used his offensive for the majority of the match. The exciting points of the match were Rob Van Dam offensive but were few and far between. Goldust also didn't have much heel heat to make the match better.

Best Performence - Rob Van Dam

3rd Booker T & Test vs C-Tazz & C-Spike Dudley - WWF Tag Team Championship

Spike Dudley is terrible, Booker T put on a great show carrying Tazz and Spike Dudley even though Tazz can wrestle Booker put on a show. He looked very good and showed he should be in more important matches.

Best Performence - Booker T

Match Rating 4.5/10

4th Edge vs C-William Regal - IC Championship Brass Knuckles on a Pole

William Regal had a great match, he really showed he can wrestle but there was just too much going after the pole and not enough high impact moves after that. The brass knuckles really didn't come into play and Edge didn't show how well he can wrestle.

Best Performence - William Regal

Match Rating 6/10

5th The Undertaker vs The Rock

Well somehow this turned into a No DQ match because both men should have been DQ'ed and Counted Out in this match. The Undertaker dominated the early match with the Rock not having much offense until the end of the match. The owners got involved to keep this match interesting as in the beginning the match was a little poor.

6th Kurt Angle vs Triple H - Hunter's WrestleMania X8 Title Opportunity Special Guest Referee Stephanie McMahon

The deck is stacked against the game but is quickly shifted when Angle clotheslines Stephanie. The match has some humor and some great wrestling from Angle and Hunter. I will never forget the elbow Stephanie dropped on Tim White, Great Moment.

I though this was a pretty good match to start off No Way Out. There was nothing really exciting just a variety of tag teams battling each other with their normal moves. Jeff Hardy does get 3-D on the floor. APA wins with a really cool clothesline from hell. Good match. 6.5/10

Goldust vs. Rob Van Dam

A very solid fast paced match up between two wrestlers with completely differing offensive moves. Goldust was really brutal to RVD throughout the match with heavy chops and punches with a grand arsenal of manoeuvres. Great ending with RVD picking up a huge win over Goldie. 8/10

This match was way too short with not a lot of manoeuvres used. Of course Spike gets double teamed throughout the match. This was a very disappointing match. 4/10

Brass Knuckles on a Pole Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship:

William Regal (c) vs. Edge

I actually to be completely honest enjoyed this match when in my opinion instead of a pole match it should've been a ladder match for the brass knucks. Besides that the match had plenty of action and blood from Edge. Regal wins through using a different brass knuckle. 8/10

The Rock vs. Undertaker

A very solid straight up normal singles match against two of my favourite WWE superstars. There was nothing really special about this match but it was interesting to see them wrestle each other and to determine the winner. Rock finally wins because of interference from Ric Flair added more suspense to the final decision. An Excellent brawl between these two. 8.5/10

Yes this was indeed the match of the night where everything was placed against Triple H. This was until Steph gets knocked out by Angle then its one on one with a fair and unbiased ref for a while. A solid match between HHH and Angle with a surprising ending in which I really enjoyed. 9/10

Chris Jericho (c) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin

This was a great match in which was completely dominated by Austin that engaged me to believe that can Austin win and definitely Jericho has no way out. The best part of this match was the ending where suspense was fully loaded with finishers from both Austin and Jericho were executed. Suddenly the damn NWO come out and attack Austin costing him the title so in actual fact Jericho did have a way out the damn NWO. 8/10 due to that NWO interference.

Overall mark is 52/70 which is pretty much 74% which is a A- grade making No Way Out 2002 a ppv that is definitely worth to buy and have a look at.

This PPV did indeed set up some fueds for Wrestlemania 18, but apparently the WWF forgot about the matches themselves.  This was one of the worst PPV's ever as far as match quality goes.

1. The NWO comes out and addresses the crowd.  I was a little suprised this happended so early on.  They will get involved gradually throughout the night.

2. Hardy's vs. APA vs. Billy & Chuck vs. Dudley's vs. Scotty 2 Hotty & Albert vs. Christian & Lance Storm (Tag Team Turmoil for #1 Contender for Tag Titles)

This could have been a good way to kick off the show, but the match was slow at points and a little sloppy.  There were some decent spots in the match, but nothing too worthwhile.  (7/10)

3. Goldust vs. RVD

Pretty good match (maybe match of the night, although that is not saying much), but kind of pointless.  The only real reason for this match was to put RVD over as a face.  (7.5/10)

4. Tazz & Spike vs. Booker T & Test (Tag Titles)

The WWF really had something going with Booker T and Test as tag partners, but they basically let it go after this match.  Nothing too exciting this match either.  (6.5/10)

5. William Regal vs. Edge (Intercontinental Title/Brass Knuckles on a Pole Match)

These two had great beef together, but the matches just were never that good.  No Way Out was the third consecutive PPV these two wrestled at and they had numerous matches on RAW.  Boring, slow paced match.  The brass knucks needed to be used a lot more.  Disappointing.  (6/10)

6. The Rock vs. Undertaker

These fued kind of came out of nowhere.  Boring match with nothing really going on at all.  Ric Flair makes a surprise appearance.  (7/10)

7. Kurt Angle vs. Triple H (#1 Contender for the Undisputed Title at Wrestlemania 18/Stephanie McMahon as Special Guest Referee)

This could have been a great technical match between Angle and Triple H, but too much of the match was focused on Stephanie.  Again, very disappointing.  The two competitors would go on to have a good cage match on RAW a couple of weeks later.  (7/10)

Good match, but not PPV main event quality.  These two just did not mesh well together.  Good ending.  (7/10)

While Wrestlemania 17 was the best show of 2001, No Way Out came pretty damn close in terms of quality and entertainment, and earned the honor of being the second best show of 2001. Two matches on the card earned the honor of being the best two matches in all of 2001. They even beat the matches at Wrestlemania 17. The first is Austin vs Triple H in the ""2 out of 3 falls"" match. Austin and Triple H worked their butts off in this match. Every minute of the match went back and forth between the two of them. The ending was extremely unpredictable. The second amazing match was Kurt Angle vs The Rock. This is probably one of the best matches that The Rock ever put on. Kurt Angle and The Rock had very good chemistry in the ring together and put on an exciting and technically sound match. The ""Fatal Four-Way"" match for the IC title between Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, and X-Pac was technical wrestling at its best. Jericho, Benoit, and Guerrero are argulaby three of the greatest technical wrestlers alive today. Other stand out matches include the Hardcore Title match between Big Show and Raven, and the ""Triple Threat Tag Team Table"" Match between Kane/Undertaker, Edge/Christian, and The Dudley Boys.
Over the years, I have seen many WWE shows. However, the 2001 No Way Out show continues to be one of the best that I have ever seen. The entire card was great for the most part, and it featured 2 of the best matches of 2001. If you are a WWE fan, this is truly a must own.

932968,4,6304826184,"This is a Great Pay Per View to be so slow.  The nWo did have an impact on the main event.  They came back with a bang. Good to see them back.  The matches at this No Way Out set up Wrestlemania without a doubt. My match reviews go like this:
Tag Team Turmoil:
Hardy's -vs.- Dudley's -vs.- Christian & Lance Storm -vs- APA -vs.- Scotty 2 Hotty & Albert -vs.- Billy & Chuck
Started off slow but picked up when the Hardy Boys entered.  Sucks how they get beat up after defeating the Dudley Boys.  Pretty good opener.  4/5
RVD -Vs.- Goldust
A great match.  RVD got his but kicked all over the ring, but in the end lands the 5 star frog splash. 5/5
Tag Team Title Match:
Tazz and Spike -Vs- Test and Booker T
Tazz is extra tough.  Both put on a hell of a show.  The ending is pretty funny.  Gotta love the champs.  3.5/5
InterContinental Title Match:
Edge -Vs- William Regal

Brass Knuckles is a page out of the idea of the Ladder Match.
Edge beat the hell out of William Regal.  Regal used an illegal pair of brass knuckles and knocked Edge out.  A lot of nice spots for both competitors. 5/5
Rock -Vs- The Undertaker
A lot of emotions mixed in this match.  This match started off very fast with the Rock landing a lot of high impact, fast paced moves.  The Undertaker made this match very slow.  Rock showed how great of an entertainer he was by making the match interesting again.  The ending was the best of the night.  5/5
# 1 Contender Match:
Triple H -Vs- Kurt Angle  Special Referee:  Stephanie McMahon
A great match, but after Triple H dumped Stephanie, you knew that he had no chance in hell.  Triple H did put on a show with a lot of good spots from him and Kurt.  The ending sucks, but a good match. 5/5
Undisputed Title Match:
Chris Jericho -Vs- Stone Cold Steve Austin
This was not a good main event.  A good match, but not main event material.  The NWO made their presence in the WWE felt with their impact on the main event.  Not a worthy main event.  Should have been Kurt -Vs- Triple H. 4/5
This DVD is one of the slowest, as far as the matches go.  The matches were drawn out and boring at some spots,  but other spots showed the WWE that everybody knows and loves.  I say buy it, especially if you like the nWo.  I recommend that if you buy this DVD, that you also buy Wrestlemania X8.",1068422400,,2301,4.184931506849315

932970,3,6304826184,"WWE No Way Out 2001 was a pretty good PPV. Although it wasn't perfect, it still deserves a positive review. At first, I didn't like it. But after watching it more closely, I realized it was better than I'd given it credit for. Here's a list of the matches, each with a personal review & star rating:
Hardcore Championship match
Raven vs. Big Show - This match was far from being 'hardcore.' Just two guys taking a bunch of stupid bumps while using phony weapons. These are the kind of matches that should never happen in the first place. It's so cartoonish it's not even funny. *
Fatal Four-Way Match for the IC Championship
Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. X-Pac vs. Eddie Guerrero - Now this is how you do a fatal four-way match! Technically and athletically, this is one heck of a match. ***1/4
Stephanie McMahon vs. Trish Stratus - I got a kick out of this catfight. Trish & Stephanie look so hot, and watching them beat the mess out of each other is a blast! My favorite part is when Stephanie splashes Trish with a pitcher of water at ringside. Not much of a wrestling match, but still fun to watch if you like catfights. ***
Jerry 'the King' Lawler vs. Steven Richards - Those hoping to see The Kat get naked will be very disappointed. This match should have never happened. It stunk. *
Triple Threat Tag Team Title Table Match
Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Kane & Undertaker - This was a pretty good match. It started out really well and caught my interest. Unfortunately, it just didn't quite stick together as the match seemed to fall apart & lose its punch at about halfway. Still watchable though. **1/4
2 Out-of-3 Falls Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H - I don't know about everybody else but I thought this match was a bit disappointing. It was too long and dragged on too much. The 1st Fall was pretty good. The 2nd Fall (street fight) was fair, but not as good as it could have been. When Austin found a barbed wire bat hidden at ringside, I got really excited. But when Triple H got ahold of it and went to hit Austin in the head with it, you can clearly see Austin block it with his hand. Austin blew it! The backdrop through the announce table was cool, but the rest of the match was just slow and boring. The 3rd Fall (steel cage match) was fair. The barb wire bat was used a lot during this Fall, but you can tell it isn't really doing any damage. No skin being ripped open or anything. The blood doesn't really look that good either. This match in my opinion was the most over-rated match of 2001. It was still a good match though, with a fair amount of violence and hardcore action. If you love 2-Out-of-3 Falls matches, then you don't wanna miss it. ***
WWE Championship match
The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - This was the best match on the whole PPV. It has great athleticism, great psychology, and is a must-see match for any true wrestling fan. It also has some unpredictable twists you have to see for yourself. *****",1059436800,,2957,4.368421052631579

932972,1,6304826184,"WWF No Way Out 2002 is possibly and probably the worst pay per view (ppv) of 2002, the wrestling was for the most part poor and the New World Orders Return was to most people a disappointment. Below is a review of all the matches and the overall DVD, hopefully it will help you decide if you should buy this DVD or not. The review will not directly give away who wins any of the matches but the winner may seem pretty obvious by my explanations of some of the matches.
( Match Reviews )
--- Tag Team Turmoil Match for a Title Shot at Wrestlemania 18 - Hardy Boyz Vs Dudley Boyz Vs Christian and Lance Storm Vs APA Vs Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert Vs Billy and Chuck ---
This was for the most part a fast paced match, the Hardyz made there return allowing for Jeff to do some of his high risk moves. The last two team to be in this match are in my opinion the two least entertaining teams in the match. I believe the winners are undeserving. Although the match truly is not bad it is still the worst tag team turmoil match the WWE has put together that I can think of. (5.5/10)
--- Goldust Vs Rob Van Dam ---
This was a basic RVD match except this is slower then usual and contained a few cool moves and submissions by Goldust. This match dragged on at points however it did go back and fourth, contain some cool counters and have some stiff moves, pretty good match. (5.5/10)
--- WWF Tag Team Championship Match - Tazz and Spike Dudley Vs Booker T and Test ---
There is not much to say about this average tag match that contained some sloppy moves and a pretty good and slightly comical finish. (4/10)
--- Brass Knuckles on a Pole Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship Match - William Regal Vs Edge ---
This was like a cheap version of a ladder match, it contained some high impact moves however the biggest move of the match turned out very sloppy. The finish is screw jobbed however it works alright with the match. (5.5/10)
--- The Rock Vs Undertaker ---
Despite this matches fast start the action in this moves pretty slowly, the match contains some sloppy moves and long walks through the crowd and around the ring. There is pretty good back and fourth action and again, although the finish is screw jobbed and chaotic it worked alright with the match. (4.5/10)
--- No. 1 Contender Match - Triple H Vs Kurt Angle ---
This whole match is basically a chaotic screw job served with a bunch of ref bumps. This suplex filled match was poorly paced and to unrealistic, even for wrestling. (4/10)
--- Undisputed WWF Championship Match - Chris Jericho Vs The Rock ---
This match was a huge chop fest, the chops where basically needed to give the crowd any sort of life.  The match moves around the ring and contains 3 repetitive superplexes. Austin and Jericho do a good job of countering each other's finishers. I believe the screwjob finish did not work because the interferer's of the match provided minimal damage. It is predictable but overall not an bad match, by my count the best on the card. (6/10)
( Overall DVD )
The DVD itself is poorly put together with no extra features, some superstar and the ppv music is changed to much poorer themes. There is no 3 minute or so music video to start off the show, The show starts immediately with a short graphic and pyro that lasts about 3 seconds. None of the matches are absolutely horrible (although some come close) but none of them are anything special either. The whole show is rather boring to sit threw. The three main events plus the pole match end in screw jobs. The New World Order's return was a disappointment by my standards and not a good enough reason to buy this DVD. The reason I gave this DVD 1 star is because I simply cannot recommend it to more than 20% of all wrestling fans. The fans I could just maybe recommend it to are those who where at the event, those who like to collect historic footage and those who like to collect wrestling DVD's despite there overall quality. Its your choice but there are better WWF/WWE DVD's out there and lots of them.",1056672000,4,4030,4.387700534759358

933035,2,6304826184,"No Way Out 2002 saw the return of the nWo or Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan. Personally I ordered this PPV just on the hype that 3 of the most influential guys in the business were coming back to the WWE. I ended up being very disappointed in the end.
The matches, for the most part, were average at best and ridiculous otherwise. Edge vs Regal (Brass Knuckles on a Pole) IC title on the line wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Nothing special and I was getting REAL tired of Regal using the brass knuckles at this point. And I still am, why? Because the last time anyone used the brass knuckles on a regular basis to win matches is when Paul ""Mr Wonderful"" Orndorf went heel in the 80's. Obviously, you see where I'm going with this. Look just because it's a classic tactic, doesn't make it good. If you think that it's great that he uses the brass regularly, you probably thought that the ""Heart Punch"" was a great finishing move as well.
Spike Dudley and Tazz vs Booker T and Test, Tag Team title. This was an O.k. match but it really showed which direction the Tag Team ranks were going, IE: put 2 singles competitors together and call it a tag team. I'm sorry but the last time that worked is when Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart were a tag team and a good one at that!
Austin vs Jericho, WWE Championship, was probably the best match of the night and it's still not saying much because of the rest of the card. I will say that the match was pretty good and we did get a little classic nWo ""spray paint"". Nothing like the height of the nWo when they'd mess up every match and spray paint everyone, but still good enough.
The other thing that absolutely bothered me about this PPV was that the nWo got (for lack of a better term) hoed out the entire night by several top WWE names like Austin and the Rock. Really, it's Nash, Hall and Hogan. That in itself was disappointing just because you know that back on WCW, Austin and the Rock would've gotten their butts handed to them in a paper bag for smarting off like that. Really, if they wanted to hoe out the nWo, why didn't they just bring back Disco Inferno?
Anyway, skip NO WAY OUT 2002. Instead, go straight for WRESTLEMANIA 18. It's much better in all ways from matches to even replay of the PPV (worth watching more than once). Seriously, this was the worst PPV of 2002.",1043884800,,2346,4.297968397291196
933036,1,6304826184,"What was this!? This whole PPV was pathetic! Every match was terrible, some matches I had to fast forward through because they where so boring they almost made me go to sleep! The main event was the only good match on the whole card, while all the others where horrible.",1037923200,,270,4.42
933037,4,6304826184,"This was a very good PPV, almost perfect. The wrestling event actually did a good job at living up to it's hype. WWE No Way Out had a little bit of everything; hardcore matches, technical matches, comedy, and even chicks! Here's my review for each wrestling match on the card. And I give every match between 1 and 5 stars.
WWE Hardcore Championship match:
Raven vs. The Bigshow - This match was a big joke! It was plumb silly with it's cartoonish violence and dull action. This ain't no hardcore matchup! As a result of the ridiculous 24/7 rule, this match looks like a parody of The Three Stooges! Poor. *
Fatal Four-Way Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship:
Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. X-Pac vs. Eddie Guerrero
This was an excellent all-out technical wrestling match, showing just what fatal four-way matches should be about. ****1/2
Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs. Trish Stratus - This was a pretty wild catfight between two hot chicks!!! I like the part where Stephanie splashes a jar of water on Trish at ringside! You get to see Trish wet! I love it! Great effort from both ladies. ***1/2
Jerry ""The King"" Lawler w/ The Kat vs. Steven Richards w/ RTC - O.K. This match stunk! Jerry Lawler lost the match & we didn't get to see The Kat get naked. What a crock! Jerry Lawler has had much better matches that this. *
Triple-threat Tag Team title table match: Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Kane & Undertaker - This match was fair. It didn't blow me away, but it was still entertaining. It had it's moments. ***
WWE Championship Match: The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - This was the best match that Kurt Angle & The Rock have had against one another. This match was very entertaining. Great wrestling and good athleticism. It was unpredictable the whole way through. *****
2-Out-of-3 Falls Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H
1st Fall: One on One.
2nd Fall: Street Fight! No rules, NO DQ!
3rd Fall: Cage Match!
Although this match lived up to it's hype, it dragged on too much. It was also too long! But still, it was a classic feud. Weapons such as barbed wire, ring steps, chairs, the ring bell, a sledge hammer, and T.V. monitors come into play in this bloody war between two of wrestlings top superstars! Not for the faint-hearted.
This was a good PPV. I liked it a lot. Buy it while supplies last, or else.............",1035849600,,2348,4.5928571428571425
933038,2,6304826184,"I don't know about everyone else, but I thought the 2 out of 3 falls match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H was way too long & boring. It had some pretty BIG flubs that ruined the matchup, like when Triple H (supposedly) hits Steve Austin in the face with the 2 by 4 wrapped in barbed wire, you can actually see Austin get his hand in the way. So the barbed wire really hits his hand & not his face. Austin falls between the announce tables and cuts his forehead with a blade to make himself bleed. That was a huge letdown. Am I the only wrestling fan that noticed that? Nobody else reviewing this video said anything about it. Anyway, a lot of the matchup was rather predictable and slow. The barbed wire didn't even look real since we were never given a good close view of it. Even worse, after the match you can actually see HHH cutting his forehead with a blade and putting it back inside his tights! TERRIBLE!!!
The other matches on the card were O.K. but didn't blow me away though. The Rock defeated Kurt Angle after two rock bottoms to capture his sixth WWF Championship. Wow! Not a bad matchup, however, there was one BIG flub made by Kurt Angle when he was given the 1st rock bottom. Kurt was supposed to had kicked out (as scripted) but didn't ! The referee counted to 2 and stopped, and played like Kurt had kicked out. But we all know he didn't!... This PPV was fair but I've seen better than this...",1033257600,,1425,4.281481481481482
933039,1,6304826184,"I forgot to record this ppv when it happened so i decided i would get the dvd.  i thought the ppv was going to be good but i soon found out that it lacked everything. the matches were not ppv matches at all (besides rvd vs. goldust), and besides the stupid nWo, nothing important happened (im glad vince got rid of them). The whole ppv focus is on the nWo and their return [disappointed]! their is no entertainment at in in this whole ppv, you can tell that by the crowd's quite response. plus, there is no dvd extras which the wwe so should have had (some post-interviews at least). so i returned no way out by telling the store that the dvd was messed up. i then got backlash 2002 since i lost my copy (now there is a good ppv, so is wm x8 of course). i just want to know why the wwe hasn't put judgment day 2002 got yet but is putting king of the ring out in a few days? judgment was the best in your house ppv so far since no way out 2001. but anyways, no way out 2002 is horrible! the wwe even took out the rob zombie theme song, dumb!",1029456000,,1040,3.9760765550239237
933040,2,6304826184,"No Way Out 2002 was well known for the event where the supposed cancer, the group of stars who Vince McMahon hired to poison the WWE, the nWo made their debut in the WWE. While this overshadows other proceedings, there is a triple main event, a WWE championship match between a revengeful Stone Cold taking on the first ever undisputed champion Chris Jericho in a tedious brawl, Triple H and Kurt Angle fighting over Triple Hs Wrestlemania title shot in a passable encounter, and The Rock squaring off with the Undertaker in an decent outing. While those three matches did not contain the topnotch action WWE fans have came to expect, the undercard is just as weak. All this with a dead crowd and bad angles you have an abysmal event. Also, if you bought this tape looking for lots of nWo action, you will be dissapointed as they are involved very little in the event and certainly don't resemble the poison they were hired to be. I will review each match and rate it out of five stars (*****):
Tag Team Turmoil Match - Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert vs. Lance Storm and Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Billy and Chuck vs. the APA: Semi decent opener, but the crowd were not really into it and even the much hyped return of the Hardy Boyz the match seems pretty dull. **1/4
Rob Van Dam vs. Goldust: Another decent outing, this time the crowd were pretty much into it, and it was backed up with a good storyline. Still, it lasted for too long, and was boring at times. **3/4
Tag Team Championship - Test and Booker T vs. Spike and Tazz: The match itself was okay, but it was very predictible and had very little build up. **
Intercontinental Championship Brass Knuckles on a Pole match: Edge vs. William Regal: The stipulation was ridiculos and the feud between Edge and William Regal had became very stale by this time. **
The Rock vs. The Undertaker: Finally a good match, although it was full of interference towards the end. Still, perfectly acceptable wrestling which was pretty enjoyable. ***1/4
No. 1 Contenders Match - Triple H vs. Kurt Angle - Special Referee Stephanie McMahon: Another acceptable match, but it was too short to come to anything and there was little content between the five ref bumps and screwjob finish. ***
Undisputed Championship - Stone Cold vs. Chris Jericho: Tedious wrestling which could and should of been much better. Furthermore, the finish was very predictible, and the crowd sounded like they were at a funeral. **1/2
Overall a dismal event. The matches were either repetitve, interference filled or boring, and the crowd were dead for the entire event. The main event is very weak, and few titles were on the line, making few care about the event. A complete letdown in my opinion. Check out No Way Out 2001 for some quality wrestling. Rent if you must but do NOT buy.
Final Rating - 2 stars (**).",1029456000,,2852,4.594117647058823
933041,5,6304826184,"The 2001 edition of No Way Out is, without a doubt, one of the best shows of 2001. Here are the matches and how I rate them:
Hardcore Title: Raven (c) v.s. Big Show
Normal Hardcore Title match that involves many interesting weapons (even popcorn!). And, as usual, the scheduled participants aren't the only ones involved. All in all, not too bad. **3/4
Intercontinental Title: Chris Jericho (c) v.s. Chris Benoit v.s. Eddie Guerrero v.s. X-Pac
One of the best Fatal Four Way matches in quite a while. The story is all three challengers really hate Jericho. Benoit...... well he and Jericho never really got along too well (before they formed a tag team of course), Jericho put Eddie Guerrero out for quite a while with the Walls Of Jericho, and X-Pac's neck got injured from their Cage Match at No Mercy 2000. Great match. ***1/2
Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley v.s. Trish Stratus
A lot more came out of this match than a lot of people probably expected. Most probably thought this would mostly be a catfight, but these two really had quite a match. The ending wasn't too great with William Regal's interference. But still, very good women's match-up. ***
2 Out Of 3 Falls: Steve Austin v.s. Triple H
An amazing match and a definite classic. Many fans, including myself, thought this was one of the best matches of 2001. 1st Fall- One-on-One Wrestling Match. 2nd Fall- Street Fight. 3rd Fall, if necessary, Cage Match. Without a doubt, excellent match. ****3/4
Jerry ""The King"" Lawler v.s. Steven Richards
This match had the stipulation that if Steven Richards won, then The Kat (who is what the match is all about) would have to join the Right To Censor. But if ""The King"" won, The Kat could express her ""right to nudity"" (in other words, she can get nude right in the ring if ""The King"" wins). A somewhat good match, but nothing too special. Bad ending though. **1/2
Table Match/Tag Titles: Dudley Boyz (c) v.s. Edge & Christian v.s. Undertaker & Kane
Not a bad match by any means, but it was, for some reason, missing something. A good, but bad ending when Haku and Rikishi interfere. All in all though, a good effort by all 3 teams. ***
WWF Title: Kurt Angle (c) v.s. The Rock
A rematch from their encounter for the title at No Mercy 2000. I couldn't see why this could even be considered a bad match. I mean, you've got The Rock in the match, so you already know it'll be entertaining, and then you have Kurt Angle, and just about any match with him in it will be a classic. No doubt a terrific match although the interference from the Big Show was pointless. Sure he lost to the Rock on RAW in a match which would see who would face Angle at No Way Out, but that was WEEKS before the event. And after that night, nothing ever came out of it, so there really wasn't any point in having Big Show involved in the match. But anyway, the match itself was great. Both men even kick out of each others finishing move at certain points. Great match. ****1/4

RVD tried desperately to get a good match out of Goldust, but failed miserably.
Booker T and Test and Tazz and Spike was mildly OK, however, it exposed what a joke the tag division really is.
Edge and Regal put on a decent Intercontinental Title match, despite the [junky] gimmick associated with the match.
The Rock vs. Undertaker was horrible, as are most of Taker's matches. (he's still a personal favorite)
Triple H and Kurt Angle put on a good Raw main event, however, this is a pay per view and we need just a little more. (Stephanie looked really good in the ref outfit, though)
Chris Jericho vs. Steve Austin was the best match on the card, although, that isn't saying much. the only good thing about the match is that the WWE realized that Chris Jericho totally kicks some [rear] and they put him over Austin.

933096,2,6304826184,"This is probably the weakest DVD the WWF has put out yet. They edited out all the ""real"" music! I was at the PPV live (it seemed a lot more exciting then) and they played all the ""real"" music for the show, but it's dubbed over on this DVD! The official song was ""Feel So Numb,"" by Rob Zombie which they played incessantly and was a pretty cool song, but here it's dubbed over with a dumb guitar. Undertaker doesn't come out to Limp Bizkit's ""Rollin'"", they dubbed in some more generic music. Edge's theme has been dubbed to his old (when he was tagging with Christian.) And RVD's kickin' new theme by Breaking Point has been replaced with his old generic song. It's not like it dramatically changes the show or anything, but the original songs were many times better. Also, there are no special features (unless chapter breaks that don't make sense and alternate Spanish commentary count) and the sound is...well, not all that great.
The show itself isn't spectacular, not NEARLY as impressive as No Way Out 2001 (one of the WWFs best...where's the DVD for THAT?) It's not a bad night of wrestling, but when you consider how stacked the card is you'd think it'd be better.",1022284800,,1172,4.559241706161138

in when. Alright opener.
RVD V. Goldust 5.5/10 : RVD tries to save it but these guys styles just don't go good together anyways whatever.
EDGE V. Regal 6.5/10 : Brass Knucks on a pole, good ol fashioned fun. Edge [missed] again.
TAzz , Spike V. Test , BT 3/10 : the big guys control most of the match then spike gets the big tag Tazz dominates then ends.
Rock V. Taker 7.5/10 : Pretty good actually, nice ending.
Angle V. HHH (Steph as REF) 8/10 : Fun match nice ending but shocking but then the next night everything is ok again.
Stone Cold V. Y2j 6/10 : so predictable and most of match is just flair chops! Y2j's reverse on the belt is good and the ending is good I guess.

The NWO coming back was pretty good, but predictable, and the main event was just half an our full of chest slaps, with below average wresling.",1016150400,,396,4.197368421052632
933101,4,6304826184,"I order no Way out on PPV and it was an experience to say the least. the nWo came out first and although i wasn't perticularly thrilled with the way they were introduced,they did the opposite of what was expected,so they get points for that. It is amazing to see Hogan,Hall,and Nash back in the WWF. Now on to the matches:
Tag Team Turmoil: APA, Billy&Chuck, Hardy Boyz, Dudley Boyz, Christian&Lance Storm, and Scotty&Albert.-I didn't really get into this match. I was glad that the Hardyz came back and I think that Storm/Christian could make a really good tag team if pushed right. I think that Billy and Chuck are funny characters,but I can't stand their new entrance music. I give it **1/2 stars.
RVD vs. Goldust-I'm a big RVD fan,so I love most of his matches. This match dragged in some parts,but overall was very good. It was interesting to see these two wrestle since they both have vastly different wrestling styles. I give this match *** stars.
WWF Tag Team Championship: Booker T& Test vs. Spike&Tazz(champs)-I love Tazz and Spike as the tag champions. That said I don't like the pairing of Booker T and Test. Booker T is a great wrestler and so is Test,but there characters have been dragging. Test has pretty much stopped his immunity gimmick since the Alliance has ended and Booker T has gotten stale... There really wasn't any build-up for this match. I think it was announced the week of no Way out,so there really wasn't and feud to it. I think if it was built up more it could have been better. I give it ** 1/2 stars.
Brass Knucks on a pole match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship: Edge vs. Regal(champ)-I like both of the wrestlers,but their feud has grown stale. I was anxious to see this match however though because it is a classic WCW match. I think this match could have been better. I think the way that Regal won was really cheap and it gives him less credibility as a champion. ** stars.
Rock vs. Undertaker-I was excited about seeing this match as it is two of the biggest starts in the WWF going at it. Some people have said that the Undertaker has lost a step or two,but I don't think he has. His match at Vengeance w/RVD was awesome and definately his best in a while. The biggest problem I think in this match is that the Rock doesn't do a lot of moves. The sad thing is is that if you've seen some of the Rock's old matches he used to do a lot of different moves. I think they need to expand his wrestling style and give him a couple of new moves,so that his matches become less repetitve. *** stars just for nostalgic purposes.
Triple H vs. Kurt Angle w/ Stephanie McMahon as referee, winner goes on to WrestleMania X8 in an Undisputed Championship match...so this match seemed kind of pointless. However,the ending was very much a shocker and I would have loved it if they had kept it that way. I think that Angle/Jericho at Wrestlemania would have been awesome. alas it is not to be. very good match though even though the screw job by Stephanie was expected. overall though *** stars.
Undisputed Championship: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Jericho(champ)-The whole match I was waiting for the nWo to come down. I knew that Jericho was going to Wrestlemania,so I wasn't expecting much from this match. I'm a fan of both wrestlers,so it's always fun to see them wrestle. The ending was semi-predictable because of what happened earlier in the night. I give it *** stars just because of Hall spray painting nWo on Austin's back.
Overall,this was a really good ppv. I think more could have been done with the nWo,but it is great to see them back in the WWF. They pretty much overshadowed all of the other matches. One note though. Hogan should never ever take off his bandana. It's true his bald head really shows his age. Other then that I think the nWo made a decent entrance into the WWF and a lot of the things that happened throughout let really well into Wrestlemania. I hope they put a lot of extras into this dvd as they should. It really is a monumental event and the next night's RAW is something that should not be missed.",1016064000,13,4073,4.497975708502024

I do not want to spoil this event for you so I will just do a run down of this event. The nWo came out in the beginning and talked a lot of B.S. The opening contest was the tag team turmoil match with the winner receiving a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship at Wrestlemania X-8. Many people expected the Hardyz or The Dudleyz to be victorious in this one but they were not. The ending of this was a huge surprise. I would give this match a 7.0 out of 10. Another match featured Goldust squaring off against ""Mr. PPV"" Rob Van Dam. This match was quite long and featured Goldust's first singles PPV match since returning at January's Royal Rumble. This match really reminded me of the 1996-1997 time period where Goldust had obessions with certain wrestlers and played some heavy mind games with them(ex: Razor Ramon and Roddy Piper). Many spots in this match were botched but al in all I give this one a 6.5 out of 10. The WWF Tag Team Titles were on the line as Tazz and Spike Dudley defended against Test and Booker T. This match was crap. I give it a 4.0 out of 10. William Regal defended the IC Title against Edge in the first ever ""Brass Nuckles on a Pole Match"". This match was probably the best of all 3 of Edge and Regals matches. I gave this classic encounter a 7.5 out of 10. Now we move on to the triple main event. The first match of these 3 was The Rock taking on The Undertaker. This match in my opinion was the best on the card. I gave this a 8.5 out of 10. Kurt Angle squared off against ""The Game"" HHH with Hunter's ex-wife Stephanie McMahon as guest referee. this match was good but not great. I have seen much better between the two. The stipulation in this match was that the winner would go to the main event of Wrestlemania o face the Undisputed Champion. I gave this a 6.5 out of 10. And finally the main event. The Undisputed Title was on the line as Y2J Chris Jericho fought Stone Cold Steve Austin. Great match with a little surprise from the nWo. I gave this one an 8.0 out of 10. So thats No Way out wraped up. I really enjoyed this event and can't wait 'till it comes on video. A must buy. Obverall this event was an easy 8.0 out of 10.

Even the first fall, which was an allegedly basic one-on-one match, had a high level of intensity. The end of this match was a very clever piece of booking.

It kicked off with the Big Show and Raven for the hardcore title. A nice opener that kicked things off with a bang and a few other superstars run out such as Billy Gunn, Steve Blackman and Crash Holly and the title changed a few times as well.
Next was the Intercontinental Championship match and was a GREAT Fatal Four way match featuring Chris Beniot vs X-pac vs Chris Jericho vs Eddie Guerrero. All this wrestlers are outstanding and when ever you have a match with any of these guys it is shore to be GREAT.This was a fast paced enetertaining bout and was 1 of the nights best.
Trish Stratus vs Stephanie Mcmahon. This was just a cat fight that started off cool but got too boring. I thought we would have seen a bit more.
Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs Stevie Richards. If Lawler won the match you get to see  the Kat naked,The match it self was pretty dissapionting, this match could have been for RAW the next night.
Undertaker & Kane vs Edge and Christian vs Dudly Boyz for the Tag Team Championship in a table match. It was a good match but i still was a little dissapionted as i though there would have been more tables but still a good match. No table match will ever beat the Dudlyz vs Hardyz table match at the 2000 Royal Rumble.
WWF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP - The Rock vs Kurt Angle. This is a nice hard fought match up and better than there No Mercy 2000 bout.
2 OUT OF 3 FALLS MATCH - STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN vs HHH
A nice stipulation to the match up as well. 1st fall is striaght wrestling. 2nd fall STREET FIGHT and 3rd fall is necessary a STEEL CAGE match.
Austin and HHH had a lot to live up to as there fued was extremely intense and this was a very awaited match up that didn't dissapiont. It is a shame that this wasn't the main event, it was like the 3rd last match but anyway the 1st fall was what you would expect from this two. The street fight was a very cool brawl with a few nice weapons. And you are just going to have to wait to see if there was a STEEL CAGE match, even though everyone has given it away.
High Spot - HHH getting back body dropped from 1 announce table to the other.
All in all a pretty good PPV from the WWF  and most wrestlers were really getting started for WRESTLEMANIA.My favourites of the night was the Rock vs Angle, Fatal Four match and 2 out of 3 falls which was a hardhitting bloody match. Another STREET FIGHT to check out is at the 2000 Royal Rumble with HHH vs CACTUS JACK this is a STREET FIGHT at its best and ive never seen another one beat it.

By the way, Jerry left the WWF 2 days after this event, this was his last WWF match and his 2nd to last commentary, he will be missed. Austin vs HHH was awsome! There was maybe some long down time but what do you expect when they nearly kill each other? Here is my rating of each match:
2-Out-of-3 Falls Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H 1st Fall: One on One 2nd Fall: Street Fight! No rules, no DQ! 3rd Fall: Cage Match! *****-Good match but everyone knew that it would go down to a 3rd fall, that always happens.

WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs. the Rock *****-Really really good match. At the end, look for a Rock Bottom and the referee count to 2 but Angle never kicked out, Rock does another one and yells at the refferee to count it on camera, FUNNY!

Hardcore Championship Raven vs. The Big Show A lot of fun, to kick off the event and get the fans in the mood. Several superstars interfere during the match and one of them even wins the title! But, in the end, Big Show clears the ring then wins the title. Great way to start off. C+
Fatal Four-Way match for Intercontinental Championship Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero vs. X-Pac Excellent match, in my view. One of my personal favourites from the event. Amazing back-forth competition with several near-falls and pinfall breakups. It really keep the crowd going from start to finish. Jericho retains his title in the end. Excellent match! B+
Trish Status vs. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley A very surprising performance by both Trish and Steph. I never would have expected these two to go to the lengths that they did. Both put their all into it and that was well received by the fans. Hats off to both. B-
Two-out-of-Three Falls Match Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H  In quite possibly, the best match of 2001 so far, two of the biggest names in the business went at it in a brutal 2-out-of-3 falls match with a special stipulation added to each. The first fall was a 1 on 1 match-up, which Stone Cold eventually won. Next was the brutal street fight, which included a 2-by-4 wrapped in barbed wire, a sledgehammer, several chairs and, of course, the spanish announce table. After a brutal exchange, a bloody Triple H pins the Rattlesnake and then triumphs in the steel cage match following to cap off a brutal 45-50 minute time peroid and a legendary fued. Both men were pushed beyond their limits in this one. A
Table Match for the Tag Team Championship The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Undertaker & Kane Another great match to add to this spectacular event. Taker and Kane dominate the competition with several stereo maneuvers! But as they were about to win the match, Rikishi and Haku interfere, leading to a 3-D by the Dudleyz on Christian through a table and retaining the titles. B
Jerry Lawler vs. Steven Richards A match used to calm down the audience before the main event. The Kat accidently costs her man the match and her right to nudity as the RTC abduct her after the match. Nothing special here. C-
WWF Championship The Rock vs. Kurt Angle Great fast paced back-and-forth action with several near-falls made this an excellent contest. Better than the Triple H-Angle match at the Royal Rumble in my opinion. Even though the Rock won the match, Kurt made his road to the championship a very hellacious one. He showed in this match that he is very worthy of the title. An excellent main event concluding an excellent pay-per-view! A-

Hall and Nash back in the WWE for the first time since 1996 and Hogan for the first time since 1993. The 3 basically take turns stating that they're turning over a new leaf and are not the bad guys everyone thinks they are.

1.) Tag Team Turmoil Match (Winners get Tag Team Championship Match at Wrestlemania X8): Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert vs Christian and Lance Storm vs The Hardy Boyz w/Lita vs The Dudley Boyz w/Stacy Keibler vs Billy Gunn and Chuck Palumbo vs APA

Action starts off with Scotty and Albert against Christian and Storm. Albert and Scotty control most of the bout in the opening minutes. Scotty goes for The Worm on Christian, but Storm tries to stop him with a superkick, but Scotty counters it, Christian comes up from behind with the Unprettier on Scotty to eliminate Scotty and Albert. The Hardyz storm the ring and immediately take down Storm and Christian. Storm and Christian end up getting control on Matt for a short minute or two until he makes the hot tag to Jeff who comes in and cleans house. Matt breaks up a half Boston crab from Storm on Jeff, Christian gets a hold of Matt and Storm attempts a dropkick, but Matt moves, causing him to take out Christian instead. Matt and Jeff hit the Twist of Fate/Swanton Bomb combo on Storm for the pinfall win. Christian and Storm are eliminated. Out next are The Dudley Boyz alongside the long legged Stacy Keibler who charge the ring, going right after their long time rivals. As you could usually expect with the Hardyz and Dudleyz, we get some nicely executed shifting fast paced action from these 2. Momentum was constantly shifting between the 2. Bubba and Jeff make hot tags to their respective partners. Matt cleans house and gets D-Von on the outside. Matt goes for a Twist of Fate on Bubba, but Stacy interferes, grabbing Matt by his hair. Lita runs in and tackles her down with a spear. Bubba connects with a Bubba Bomb on Matt, but just as soon, gets taken down with a hurricanrana from Lita. Back in the ring, the legal man, D-Von, attempts the Saving Grace on Matt, but Matt counters it into a roll up for the win. D-Von angrily attacks Matt and he and Bubba 3D Jeff on the floor before making their leave. Out next are Billy and Chuck who charge to the ring after Matt. Matt tries to take out Billy and Chuck himself, but it fails as he suffers a double team superkick/Fameasser from the 2 to eliminate the Hardyz. Jeff never recovered to get in the ring. Out next are the APA who make short work of Billy and Chuck. A Clothesline From Hell from Bradshaw to Billy spells the end and the APA emerge victorious of this Tag Team Turmoil. Tremendous fast paced opening tag team match from the best teams the company had back at that time.

2.) Goldust vs Rob Van Dam

This was an interesting feud to say the least. Goldust had recently returned and talked of someone's star being brighter than he wanted it to be. He revealed this person to be RVD who he viciously attacked, leading up to their PPV encounter. The match itself was fairly good with a high paced movement. RVD controls the final minutes of the match, with a scoop slam, rolling thunder, and 5 Star Frog Splash

3.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Booker T and Test vs Tazz and Spike Dudley (c)

Test and Booker attack Tazz and Spike on their way to the ring, with Test getting Tazz in the ring and beating him down. Test works over Tazz a bit, but Tazz comes back on the defensive side before tagging in Spike. Spike starts off with a little bit of control, but it ends in no time as he's quickly taken down by Test. Booker and Test make consistent tagging, working over Spike for a good majority of the match. Spike manages to connect with a Tornado DDT off the turnbuckle on to Booker. Spike makes the hot tag to Tazz, while Booker tags in Test. Tazz comes in and takes out Booker, while Spike floors Test with a Dudley Dog. Tazz gets a nearfall on Test. Test attempts a matchbook pin on Tazz with his feet on the rope, but the ref sees it and stops counting. Test shoves the referee, who shoves Test right back, into a Tazzmission. Test taps immediately, giving Tazz and Spike the win. Overall, a solid tag team bout

4.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Brass Knuckles On A Pole Match: Edge vs William Regal (c)

Someone in the creative team either had one too many drinks with Vince Russo at the local bar or someone had been watching a few too many 2000 WCW video tapes. A Brass Knuckles On A Pole Match?? Well I guess it was a bit more acceptable than a Judy Bagwell On A Pole Match. Edge attacks Regal as he's being patted down by the referee for a spare pair of knuckles. Basically the stipulation was to retrieve the knuckles from the pole, use them on your opponent, and win by either pinfall or submission. Some hilarious commentary from Lawler in the early going asking J.R if he thinks Regal knocked out his mom with a pair of brass knuckles when he was a teenager. Regal is there to stop Edge, every time he attempts to retrieve the knucks. At one point in particular, Regal shoves Edge off the turnbuckle, sending him crashing to the barricade on the outside. Regal rolls Edge back in the ring and locks on the Regal Stretch with Edge bleeding from the mouth. Regal ends up retrieving the brass weapon first, but Edge floors him with a backdrop off the top turnbuckle. A Spear allows Edge to grab the knuckles, but Regal hits a low blow and nails Edge with a spare pair of brass knuckles he had hidden in his tights. Regal makes the cover for the win. This was the last IC Championship bout these two had in their feud and it was an awesome and brutal bout to end the feud on.

Lillian Garcia interviews Kurt Angle, questioning his confidence about the match due to Stephanie McMahon's role as special referee. Angle says he's far more superior than Triple H in every way. Classic heel Angle, brags about his gold medals saying he didn't get them out of ""a box of Lucky freakin Charms"" but got them because he was the best in the world. Angle says he's glad Stephanie lied about being pregnant because HHH would've made a terrible father. Angle hilariously says he's going to be HHH's ""daddy"" and that daddy is walking out of No Way Out with a title shot at Wrestlemania. Kurt Angle was gold (no pun intended) on the mic back then. Seriously, as a face or a heel, he had some amazing promos back in the day.

5.) The Undertaker vs The Rock

This was a personal grudge match based off a heated feud that started after Undertaker attacked The Rock, feeling Rock made disrespectful jokes about his elimination from Maven at the Royal Rumble. This was during Undertaker's Big Evil tenure as the bully demanding respect from his co-workers. Great and underrated gimmick from Taker in my opinion. The Rock dashes to the ring, wasting no time to get his hands, pounding Taker with several right hands. Undertaker has the advantage over Rock for much of the first half of the match, wearing him down with several power strikes and wear down holds. Rock gets back in control, countering a big boot from Taker and sending him to the outside with strikes and a face slam into the announce table. Taker soon gets back the advantage and the 2 brawl into the crowd for a bit. After what seemed like forever, Rock makes a comeback, dropping Taker with a DDT and spinebuster, Taker counters an attempted People's Elbow, grabbing Rock by the neck, but Rock comes back with a kick to the cue balls that the referee didn't see. Referee takes a laughable bump into the steel steps and Undertaker retrieves a lead pipe from his motorcycle. Ric Flair runs to ringside and starts chopping Taker. Taker with a big boot to Flair. Rock gets Taker in the sharpshooter and Vince McMahon interferes as well, distracting the referee. Rock brings Vince in the ring and lays the Smackdown on the boss. Undertaker prepares for the Tombstone on Rock, but Flair nails Taker with the pipe behind the ref's back and Rock capitalizes with a Rock Bottom for the win. Average match I suppose. Seemed too slow at times. I'd say Rock and Taker's 1999 KOTR match was better

6.) Kurt Angle vs Triple H (Special Referee: Stephanie McMahon) - Winner gets Undisputed Championship shot at Wrestlemania X8

Triple H's comeback story continued here with another obstacle in his way--this time, old time rival, Kurt Angle, who was bitter about HHH's Rumble win and managed to get Vince McMahon to put HHH's title shot at Mania on the line here. Another story developed here with Stephanie lying to HHH about being pregnant in order to save their failing marriage. Once Trips found out about this and kicked Stephanie to the curb, HHH's match with Angle suffered a roadblock when Stephanie aligned with Vince and Kurt and inserted herself in the match as the special referee. HHH and Angle work each other over in the corner in the early going of the match. Angle attempts to clothesline HHH, but he moves and Angle ends up clotheslining Stephanie out of the ring instead by accident. Tim White ends up coming in to replace. Most of the match is back and forth with neither man keeping control for long. Angle ends up intentionally knocking Tim White out. As HHH checks on him, Angle sneaks in a low blow and hits an Angle Slam. Stephanie returns to the ring to make the count, but gets a nearfall from The Game. Angle goes for the Ankle Lock, but Trips counters and uses his other foot to shove Angle into Stephanie, knocking her out again. HHH blocks a chair shot and nails a Pedigree. Tim revives to make the pin, but Stephanie attacks him. HHH stares Stephanie down and attempts to Pedigree her, but Angle strikes HHH with the steel chair and hits the Angle Slam. Stephanie makes the pinfall to give Angle the win. Long, entertaining, alternating bout from these 2. Angle/HHH matches were always a treat and never disappointing to see

NWO catch up with The Rock in the locker room and Hogan gets a picture with The Rock for his son--until they insult Hogan's son's taste in liking The Rock. The Rock overhears and lays out the NWO with a verbal insult, referring to their previous WWE gimmicks and telling them to shove the camera up their candy---well you know the rest. Funny segment to say the least

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Undisputed Championship Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin (c) vs Chris Jericho

Austin and Jericho start off with a bit of chain wrestling, but soon enough the action gets underway. Austin gets Jericho in a corner and stings his chest with a few knife edge chops before slamming his head into the turnbuckles. Each head slam met with a loud ""WHAT?"" chant from the crowd. Jericho gets the advantage shortly before Austin regains. Soon enough the match goes to the outside of the ring and up near the entrance ramp. Austin slams Jericho's head into every piece of equipment he can find before bringing the fight back to the ringside area. Lots of exchange chopping going on in between here. The match goes back to the ring where the advantage shifts with chopping...and more chopping...and some nicely executed grapples...and more chopping. Late in the match, Jericho counters a Lou Thez Press into the Walls of Jericho, but Stone Cold gets to the ropes. Jericho goes to the outside and grabs one of his championships to hit Austin with. The ref tries to stop him and Austin accidentally knocks Jericho into Hebner, mildly dazing him. Austin goes for a Stunner, but Jericho counters, hitting a Breakdown on Austin, on to the championship for a close 2 count. Jericho goes for a bulldog, but Austin blocks, causing Jericho to knock the referee out with a clothesline. Austin gets Jericho in the Walls of Jericho and Y2J starts tapping, but there's no referee to end the match. Austin hits a Stunner and suddenly the nWo are in the ring and start attacking Stone Cold! Jericho picks up the scraps and pins Austin to get the win. After the match, the NWO continue their beat down on Stone Cold and brand Austin with their signature NWO spray paint logo. The NWO had arrived",1456704000,,14034,5.046632124352332

7877970,5,6304826184,"1.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Raven (c) vs Big Show

The match starts with a ninja woman (Tori) that had been assisting Raven in his matches, attack Big Show on the way to the ring. Raven tries to take advantage and attack Show from behind, but Show gets the upperhand and beats down on Raven to the ring. Within the opening minutes of the match, Raven is attacked by a popcorn vendor man who turned out to be Crash Holly. Soon enough; Steve Blackman and Hardcore Holly interfere in the match and mug Big Show with weapons. Eventually Billy Gunn ends up getting involved and attacks Raven with a Fameasser followed by a pin to win the title. His reign doesn't last long however, as he's attacked and taken out by Blackman and Hardcore. Raven picks up the scraps and pins Gunn to win back the title. More Mayhem ensues as Raven's ninja runs to the ring with a 2x4 but Molly Holly runs in after her and takes her out with a trash can lid shot. Big Show ends up winning the title following a Chokeslam on Raven on top of a trash can. Short Hardcore match but lots of fun chaos for such a short, 5 minute bout.

2.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho (c) vs X-Pac vs Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit

This started out as a bit of Tornado Tag Team Match as Benoit and Guerrero teamed together to take out Jericho and X-Pac in the early start of the match. Eventually the alliance between the former Radicalz members is broken and they go at it. X-Pac's buddy, Justin Credible ends up interfering and tries to assist Pac in a victory. In the midst of all the action, Jericho sneaks up on X-Pac with a roll up and retains the title. This was a really fun and fast paced match; beginning to end. If only Intercontinental Championship matches today were still like this

Vince McMahon is in the back with William Regal, giving him a pep talk on the upcoming Trish Stratus vs Stephanie McMahon match and tells him he knows he'll ""know what to do when the time is right"".

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Trish Stratus vs Stephanie McMahon

This match all stemmed from Stephanie's jealousy over Trish's relationship with Vince, leading to some rather interesting, entertaining, memorable build-up between the 2 with tons of catfights. The most notable moment being when Trish attacked Stephanie in the parking lot and shoved her on a pile of cow manure. The match starts immediately with Stephanie taking Trish down and slapping her. Trish tries to escape the ring but the Billion Dollar Princess drags her back in and kicks her butt some more. The fight goes to the outside of the ring and we get a few nice spots, including one where Stephanie dives off the turnbuckle on to Trish with a clothesline. Stephanie even went as far as to humiliate Trish by throwing a pitcher of water on Trish, getting poor Trish all wet...and shiny. The best highlight of this match was without a doubt, Stephanie ripping off Trish's tights and spanking her--to the delight of every male viewer. Regal ends up coming to the ring, supposedly to save Trish, but it turned out to be a trick as he ends up helping Stephanie and lays Trish out with a neckbreaker. Poor Trish. Stephanie takes advantage and gets the easy pinfall for the win. This was a fairly decent divas match. It was not a classic but it was decently good for it's time which was rare to say back then when Trish and Stephanie had matches

4.) 3 Stages of Hell Match: Triple H vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

The Triple H/Stone Cold feud had been going on for the last 2 years at this point and it the 2 were finally going to put their bad blood with each other to rest. After Austin and Helmsley's attacks on each other at the Royal Rumble the previous month, it was decided that they'd settle the score with each other once and for all in a 3 Stages of Hell match. The first fall would be a regular match, the second fall would be a Street Fight, and if necessary; the third fall would take place inside of a Steel Cage. Austin gets the first win, catching HHH with a Stunner off the top turnbuckle. The second fall in the Street Fight is where things began to get brutal. Within the first 5-10 minutes of the second fall, Austin draws blood first after Triple H splits him open with a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire. A little while later, Austin opens up The Game with a nice chair shot. Things end up becoming a war zone as weapons are scattered around the area, the Spanish announce table is broken, and both competitors were bloody. There was even a funny moment where Triple H grabbed the sledgehammer from behind the commentary desk and accused J.R of hiding it there for Austin to use. HHH ends up nailing Austin with the hammer and connecting with the Pedigree to win the second fall. The cage is lowered almost immediately and the third fall begins. After some back and forth action is exchanged amongst the 2, both Austin and HHH strike each other simultaneously with the sledgehammer/2x4 in barbed wire and HHH falls back on Austin's body and gets the 3 count. It was a clever way to end one of the greatest matches from the Attitude Era and in my opinion, the greatest 2 out of 3 Falls/3 Stages of Hell Match ever. Triple H and Steve Austin had tremendous chemistry with each other in the ring and they showed it in this amazing, bloody, 2 year war they had with each other

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Steven Richards w/Ivory vs Jerry Lawler w/The Kat

This match was pretty much the peak of the RTC storyline. The RTC had been running roughshod over the WWF for months, censoring everything--mostly the divas that they found to be inappropriate. After trying to censor The Kat from getting naked, Jerry Lawler stepped in for his best friend (both kayfabe and in real life) and decided to battle the leader of the RTC, Steven Richards. If Lawler won, Kat would strip naked live in front of everyone; but if Richards won, The Kat became property of the RTC. It was the Right to Censor vs the Right to Nudity. Lawler and Richards trade a few blows and just as Lawler looks to have the victory, Ivory interferes and distracts the referee. While the referee is distracted, Kat gets in the ring and tries to hit Richards with Ivory's championship, but she misses and hits Lawler instead. Richards makes the pin and gets the win. The rest of the RTC rush to the ring and take Kat away. Not really a good match but it wasn't about the match, it was about furthering the story which they succeeded at. If I remember correctly, this was the last time The Kat was on TV as she was fired shortly after which of course in turn, lead to Lawler's absence from the company until that November

6.) WWF Tag Team Championship Triple Threat Tables Match: Kane and The Undertaker vs Edge and Christian vs The Dudley Boyz (c)

The match starts off with Edge and Christian being surrounded by the Brothers of Destruction and The Dudleyz at the entrance ramp. E&C make an escape, leaving the Dudleyz and the Brothers of Destruction to go at it. From there on out for the remainder of the match, it's triple threat tag team mayhem as the 3 teams exchange shots between each other. Just as the Brothers of Destruction look to have  victory at hand in the end, they're assaulted by Rikishi and Haku, starting a brawl between the 2 teams. The brawl costs Kane and Taker the match, as the Dudleyz 3D Christian through a table to retain the titles

After a tremendous pre-match video package showcasing the feud build-up between The Rock and Kurt Angle, Michael Cole conducts a backstage pre-match interview with The Rock, asking him if he's ready to fight Angle. We don't get the usual ""Finally The Rock has come back.....If Ya Smell"" promo from The Rock. The Rock has his game face on and in a serious mood makes it short and sweet telling Angle his reign as WWF Champion is over

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle (c) vs The Rock

Angle and Rock have an intense stare down with each other and the stare down is broken with Rock blocking a cheap shot from Angle and laying the smackdown on him with right hands in the corner. From there on out, we get a great fast paced match from both young and athletic men. Both men end up exchanging belly to belly suplexes between each other, with the crowd eating it all up. Following a DDT from The Rock, both men are left lying, which brings out Big Show, who lays out Angle, Rock, and referee Mike Chioda with Chokeslams before making his leave. Earl Hebner would come down to take Chioda's place and the match continues on. While Hebner tends to Chioda, Rock pulls of a heelish move, nailing Angle with the championship. Rock ends up hitting a Rock Bottom on Angle and Earl makes the count but stops at 2 for some reason. Rock pulls off another Rock Bottom and pins Angle for the win. Simply put, an incredible match. The Rock and Kurt Angle didn't have too many one on one matches against each other, but when they did, it was a treat to see. This match was undoubtedly probably the best match they had against each other and head and shoulders better than their match they had at No Mercy. This match was much more fast paced and told an incredible story as it unfolded

Overall: No Way Out 2001 was an amazingly booked PPV as the final PPV before Wrestlemania. It's tough to decide which match stole the show between Triple H vs Austin and Rock vs Angle, but I'd probably feel more inclined to go with Austin and Triple H. It may very well even be the best No Way Out in the PPVs history. It was just a night of action and mayhem which was was the Attitude Era was all about.",1425945600,,10709,4.992148065058889

NO WAY OUT 2002

You will notice that the first letter of each word in the title is NOW which made sense since the NWO retuned at this event. That was the major thing about this event and the most memorable thing about it. The card was good but before the three main events it felt like any other televised show like Raw or Smackdown. Still it was a good event with the NWO starting the show and saying one thing that leads to a completely different other. Also there were some good backstage things with them.

1.[TAG TEAM TURMOIL MATCH]SCOTTY 2 HOTTY & ALBERT VS CHRISTIAN & LANCE STORM VS THE HARDY BOYZ VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ VS BILLY & CHUCK VS APA-I always love these types of matches as they are full of action. Plus I am a huge fan of tag team wrestling. Here two teams would be in the match and once one is eliminated another team takes their place. The action here is good and fast paced with all teams looking good. The APA end up winning the match and getting the title shot at Mania later.

2. RVD VS GOLDUST-this was a good match between the two with a little slip up right at the beginning. Good solid match with Goldust taking control of most of the match. RVD of course would fight back and would eventually win the match. Over all a good match with both guys working well together

3.[TAG TITLES]TAZZ & SPIKE DUDLEY VS BOOKER T & TEST-this match is better than  most say it is but it isn't the best tag match ever. Still I did enjoy this match with Tazz and Spike coming from behind to retain the straps. Still Booker T and Test did a great job here and looked like they were going to take this one.

4.[I-C TITLE BRASS KNUCKLES ON A POLE MATCH-WILLIAM REGAL VS EDGE-I have always been a huge fan of Regal since his WCW days so I was into this one. Edge has always been good and these two work well together. I know some people didn't like this match but I thought it was good. Regal of course cheats to win but that is all good with me. Good slower match that sees Regal retain.

5. THE ROCK VS THE UNDERTAKER-possibly the best match on the card with two greats going at it. The action here is great as they go all over the place brawling. Flair and Vince even get involved in this one adding to the drama that lead to Taker versus Flair at Mania. The Rock gets the win here although I felt Taker should have taken this one.

6. KURT ANGLE VS TRIPLE H-this was my favorite match of the night and I loved the feud between these two and the story with Steph. This for some reason also felt like a PPV match where most others didn't for some reason. The action was excellent and Steph even took some shots here. The winner would go to Mania after winning here. Angle of course [one of my favorites of all time] would go on to win this after a great match with a nice pace.

7.[WWF TITLE]CHRIS JERICHO VS STEVE AUSTIN-another great match as the main event followed the previous two as a really good match. Like the others I know some that didn't like this as much but I thought it was great. The action is fast paced and both men do a great job with the other. Austin of course brawls while Jericho tries to slow him down. After the ref is knocked out and Y2J is stunned the NOW come out and cost Austin the match. Afterwards they continue with their attack and paint NWO on his back, classic.

Over all this was a good card with some good matches on it. Other than the NOWs WWF debut though it wasn't as memorable as it should have been.",1409184000,,3453,4.178947368421053

Tag Team Turmoil:
Hardy Boyz V. Dudley Boys V. APA V. Billy & Chuck V. Christian & Lance Storm V. Scotty 2 Hotty & Albert
Solid opener with good action. Short for this kind of match but still a good match. APA takes it. ***

RVD V. Goldust
There was really no feud to this but still a solid match. RVD wins ***1/4

WWF Tag Team Championship:
Tazz & Spike Dudley (Champions) V. Booker T & Test
Decent little match. Could be better actually. The Champs retain. **

Brass Knuckles On A Pole Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship:
William Regal (Champion) V. Edge
This match is straight out of the Vince Russo play book. The funny thing is that I remember this match being better. Decent match. If this match was 4 or 5 years later, it could have been great. Regal cheats to retain. **3/4

Undertaker V. The Rock
Match of the night. Great match with back & forth action. The Rock pulls it out. ***3/4

Number One Contender's Match @ WrestleMania:
Triple H V. Kurt Angle
Good match but disappointing since its HHH/Angle. Could have been a hell of a lot better. Angle is going to Mania!!! but doesn't ***1/4

Undisputed WWF Championship:
Chris Jericho (Champion) V. Stone Cold Steve Austin
Not as good as their Vengeance match but pretty solid. The nWo return & cost Austin the title. ***1/2

Overall a pretty solid show. Not a very memorable show due to not having a ""classic"" match but solid from top to bottom & a good ppv before Mania.",1352678400,,1514,4.52014652014652
7877975,5,6304826184,"Forget about the Attitude Era for a moment.
Forget about the historical significance of this PPV.
Forget about the comparisons to other 2001 and/or ""No Way Out"" PPVs
Forget about whether you are new to wrestling TV or not.

Simply put, ""No Way Out 2001"" is an awesome experience for fans who've been watching for years, and I dare say even for viewers who are wondering what in the world we fans see in this kind of programming.  Televised pro wrestling is often called a variety show, and ""No Way Out 2001"" fits that bill perfectly.

Now, I won't go so far as to call this a perfect PPV --- after all, no PPV is --- but in many ways, this 3-hour VHS is a prime example of what we look for in a WWF/WWE PPV.

1) Hardcore Championship
Big Show v. Raven (champion)
---In case you're a newcomer, there are some silly things going on here that might require explaining.  The Hardcore title was up for grabs 24/7, meaning anyone could try to win the belt at any time.  So, you're basically gonna get more than just Raven & Big Show duking it out in an anything-goes contest.  There's also some mysterious masked woman who comes to Raven's aid (I think this turned out to be Tori in later weeks, but whatever).  Anywho, this is basically a short and silly weapons show to get us excited for the event.  I wouldn't give this a very high score, but I was never bored.
""5.0 / 10""

2) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho (champion) v. X-Pac v. Eddie Guerrero v. Chris Benoit
---This situation always makes me laugh: Basically, Y2J injured two of his challengers, and had a vicious Ladder Match with Benoit just a month prior.  Everyone's got a beef with Chris Jericho, but that doesn't stop them for going for the gold.  These four men are so talented, it's just great fun seeing them compete at a quick pace with a variety of holds and moves.  In a way, it doesn't really allow for much storytelling, because it kinda becomes just a ton of exciting moves without much strategy.  But when it looks this good, who cares?  If you wanna see four gifted professionals just deliver an exciting showcase, this is a good one.
""7.5 / 10""

3) Trish Stratus v. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley
---Quick history: Vince McMahon was cheating on his comatose wife with Trish, with Stephanie (not much nicer) having a beef about it.  Now, many will disagree with me on this, but I actually think this is one of the better catfights available in the WWF/WWE catalog.  Steph & Trish just go for it, with all sorts of slaps, chops, hair-pulling, and screaming.  It's just an ugly brawl between two bitchy women, and I dug it.  William Regal's involvement as Vince's Commissioner was quite amusing.  Some may call this a waste of time; I ask those people to at least agree that today's Diva's action isn't nearly as much fun.
""6.5 / 10""

4) Two-Out-Of-Three Falls
'Stone Cold' Steve Austin v. Triple H
---There's a lot of love for this battle, and rightfully so.  When WWF asked fans to vote for their favorite matches of 2001, this was the #1 pick.  It's not even close to being my #1 choice, but that's just nitpicking.  These two really duke it out for about 40 minutes.  Each fall had its own rules.  The first was a straight-up match, second was a Street Fight, and the third round was a Steel Cage Match.  There was a lot of hype going into this one, since the beginning of this feud dated back to the summer of 1999.  Where I have some minor quibbles with this one is that there are some repeated spots that we saw with the Austin/HHH No Holds Barred encounter from just a few months prior on PPV.  Also, this is one of those strange matches where I enjoyed it from start to finish, but never got enough a rush to call it a ""masterpiece"".  However, if you want the best encounter between Steve Austin and Triple H, this is definitely my favorite.
""8.0 / 10""

5) Right To Nudity
Steven Richards v. Jerry Lawler
---This rather silly match was to determine whether The Kat (Lawler's wife) would be allowed to get naked or not.  Even if you knew how this would end up, every male still tuned in with a glint of hope, praying that Kat wouldn't be forced to join the Right To Censor faction.  Richards and Lawler put on a pretty basic fistfight, which was fine with me.  Sometimes, you can accept that you're not gonna get an intense technical showdown, and are just gonna get a fun slugfest.  The score might not be high, but I wasn't bored.
""5.0 / 10""

6) Table Match - Tag Team Championships
Kane & The Undertaker v. Edge & Christian
v. The Dudley Boyz (champions)
---Although this is one of the better matches on the card, it may also be the most disappointing.  For starters, Edge & Christian had been battling The Dudleyz for almost a year straight in much better matches.  Secondly, I guess I expected more out of Kane & Taker being added to the mix.  Finally, the interference from Rikishi & Haku doesn't do much in the grand scheme of things.  But if you can take all of these comparisons out of the equation, this triangle match was a good Table Match.  In a weird way, this would've been a much better match if the Tables weren't involved.  I know it sounds like I'm beating up on this match, but let me be clear -- it's a good match worth your time.
""7.0 / 10""

7) WWF Championship
Kurt Angle (champion) v. The Rock
---I had no idea how good The Rock really was until years after he left.  But I don't think everyone knew how good Kurt Angle was, despite all of his accolades and hard work until months after this main event.  This is the contest to prove how wrong any of Rock's or Angle's naysayers were.  The two delivered an even better contest than their ""No Mercy 2000"" a few months before.  The whole match just flows, with neither man being the clear favorite to win.  I'm not quite sure what Big Show's reason for interfering was, but it still made the seesaw battle more compelling.  These two guys gelled.  Then again, Kurt Angle and The Rock can gel with just about anybody.  Triple H & Steve Austin delivered fans' favorite match of 2001, but I think this main event was even better.
