7880684,4,6305026017,This DVD is an excellent video for teaching beginning golfers all the basic rules and proper etiquette for going to the golf course.  Payne Stewart does a good job of adding a little humor which makes it not only educational but enjoyable to watch.  Even though this was created in the 90's it still works to view it today.,1315958400,,323,4.4576271186440675
7880685,5,6305026017,"I understand some golfers' frustration at the trivial nature of this video. However, I've seen way too many beginners - most of whom I have known to be great human beings -  commit the very mistakes that Payne tries to bring up. Most beginners are not well manners because they are simply too busy trying to hit their own ball and don't have the peace of mind to think of other people. They are simply trying to play the hole and get to the next. As most beginners tend to be defensive about their etiquette, or the lack thereof, perhaps it is better to give this video to your new golf buddy as a subtle hint rather than risking your friendship with him. After all, the beginners will return your investment rather quickly with the nassaus.",1012262400,2,741,4.448529411764706
7880686,1,6305026017,"This is probably the worst thing I have ever watched.  After watching this video I said: well I'll never get that hour back.  It is absolutely worthless to anyone who has golfed more than once.  Nearly everything is so common sense that even my wife, a non-golfer, thought his information to be pointless.  The attempts at humor are rather painful; you laugh, but only because the jokes are so cheesy and imcredibly stupid.  Do not waste your time with this, even if it is a rental.",1005091200,,482,4.558139534883721
