5102569,4,B007P636CQ,"It's not a high budget film, it's doesn't have big star actors or a famous director so have realistic expectations when turning this one onto the television.  Yes the acting is rough and the production value/story is a little weak BUT I really enjoyed it!  I read the other reviews and thought this must be terrible but decided to give it a try anyway and I'm glad I did.  This one made me pull my feet up onto the couch a couple times which hasn't happened in a long time.  If you enjoy watching haunted house movies then it's worth the time to put this one under your belt and enjoy a few scares.  However, if you watch movies with a notepad to dissect the story lines and comment on acting queues then skip this one because you'll spend more time writing than watching.  I gave it a 4 star because we enjoyed watching it and appreciated a movie that could still startle us, that I think the some of the other reviewers were awfully harsh",1344729600,3,940,4.3125

5102576,1,B007P636CQ,"The Haunting of Whaley House (Jose Prendes, 2012)

The Haunting of Whaley House (and sing this with me if you know the words, kids--you probably should by now) is one of those movies that starts out very unsure of the kind of movie it's trying to be. Unlike most of them, though, that seem to settle into some sort of groove after a while, this one makes every possible wrong choice and comes up with a plotless excuse for (terrible) special effects that I can't quite believe someone was desperate enough for money to release.

The movie starts off looking like it's going to be a comedy. Spoiler alert: the biggest mistake made during the making of this film was abandoning the comedy angle and going for a straight horror film, because the opening scenes of this movie--while still well below average--are its best. As soon as it tries to go serious-horror, it fails, and fails miserably; there is not a single original idea to be found here, the special effects are ghastly, the acting is awful, etc. I could write a thousand words about how bad this movie is, but I can show you in a single sentence: Jose Prendes' next job was writing Hansel & Gretel, the Asylum mockbuster aimed at the Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters crowd.

One of the friends bring along a noted tv psychic and his nerdy assistant to investigate the existence of the alleged ghosts.  From there on, the requisite sightings and horrific deaths ensue.
WHALEY HOUSE is a fairly entertaining spook story with decent effects and an appearabce from real-life psychic Lynn Lowry.  At least it's not another found footage fiasco.",1365206400,,642,4.738738738738738
5102579,2,B007P636CQ,"I live in San Diego where the real Whaley house is - this movie was really stupid.  The house doesn't look remotely like the real Whaley house, the plot was just typical slasher-horror-movie stuff, and the acting was goofy at best.

For those that don't know, The Whaley House is an actual building in Old Town, San Diego that is claimed to be one of the most haunted houses in the country. The house does exist! I have been there. I did not see any ghosts or any hauntings. But thats not for me to discover. This film is really only in name and nothing else of its history. Ultimately the film loses it for me after this. The house does not even look like it tries to be modeled after the real house. It does not borrow the legends or stories surrounding it. It ends up being a weird mess that makes no sense. Its not scary, it just becomes stupid.",1362355200,,872,4.388888888888889

The effects are actually really great for the budget. The actors are pretty good, but have their excessively cheesy moments.

I rented this from RedBox not knowing it was from Asylum by the film description. had I known, I wouldn't have.

It's one of the better films from Asylum, but not that much better. There's a few creepy scenes, but the plot is wooden and predictable. The acting is, well, low level.

Nobody is renting (or purchasing) this thing, and expecting ""Raiders of the lost arc.""

It's a nice, albeit cheaply made horror flick, that is effective in what it sets out to do:
Give you some creepy visuals, drum up a few scares, and give you a fun little ghost story.

5102600,2,B007P636CQ,"While flipping the new and recent releases, I saw this movie, watched the trailer and thought ""I HAVE to see this"". Wrong! The premise is pretty straight forward: a young woman (who doesn't believe in ghosts) works at a haunted house as a tour guide. She's given 3 simple rules for the house, on of which is ""Never go inside at night"". Stemming from the peer pressure, she allows them into the house at night.

Now I'm not looking for a whole lot originality or top notch acting but this  movie left a lot to be desired. There are 3 main females, all of which look too old for the role they're playing. It doesn't help either when the movie is in HD and the camera is directly in their face. Acting wise, the worst offender of this was this black guy (can't remember his name) they called in as a ghost specialist of sorts. His persona and voice irritated me immediately. Then there is a scene where he begins to go off on a rant and I didn't know whether to laugh or just cut the movie off. Beyond that, I didn't get any suspense from the movie and it almost felt like the trailer and movie were from two different cuts.",1345420800,3,1121,4.258215962441315

5102602,3,B007P636CQ,"For the past four months, Penny Abbott (played by Stephanie Greco) has been working as a tour guide at The Whaley House, where Anna and three other members of the Whaley family died during the 1800s. Penny is a skeptic and doesn't believe in the ghostly encounters that tourists claim to see there, even when a new tourist has to be hospitalized after claiming that she saw ghosts.

Penny is close with Bethany Romero (played by Lynn Lowry), who has been running the museum for over thirty years. She gives Penny three rules of the Whaley House that you should never break.

  Don't Call the Ghosts Out
  Don't Damage the House
  Don't Ever Go Inside the House at Night

After Penny tells her boyfriend Jake and their three friends, Vanessa, Craig, and Giselle about the incident with the tourist, they persuade Penny to go with them to the house that night to see if there are any real ghosts. She agrees and lets them inside the house, along with Ray, who has all the paranormal gadgets and gizmos, and the famous psychic, Keith Drummond.

As they attempt to investigate, Vanessa flips out just like the tourist did and an accident occurs. What they don't know is that Anna Whaley's spirit doesn't like unwanted guests at night and one by one she'll claim all of their souls.

The ASYLUM Home Entertainment was nice enough to send me a free DVD in exchange for this review. The Haunting of Whaley House is similar to The ASYLUM's other recent release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/100th-Street-Haunting-The-Ghost-of-Richard-Speck/dp/B007UTB5JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">100th Street Haunting (The Ghost of Richard Speck)</a>, as both plots are based on actual haunted locations. Due to budget restraints, they couldn't afford to film the movie at the actual Whaley House (an official Haunted House by the United States Commerce Department), so they found another creepy looking house for the movie.

The plot is simple; a group of friends sneak into a haunted house looking for ghosts. The premise works well for horror films, but one of the problems I had with it is that the characters are just too old to be breaking into a house looking for ghosts. If they characters were teenagers, I can understand that, or if they characters were doing research for a college project. The acting in the movie is mediocre at best, except for Stephanie Greco, and the small appearance by screen legend, Lynn Lowry, who gave a great performance. Since I don't watch horror movies for the acting, I can overlook this.

The cinematography throughout the movie was well done considering the low-budget and I consider it to be better than some theatrical movies. I liked the fact that they used old-fashioned scares with the occasional bloody scenes, and of course the cameo by Mindy Robinson.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunting-of-Whaley-House/dp/B008R6MH0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunting of Whaley House</a>&nbsp;offers nothing new to the horror genre, but it does offer a frightening atmosphere and quirky dialogue that should satisfy most horror fans.",1344816000,13,3149,5.350202429149798
