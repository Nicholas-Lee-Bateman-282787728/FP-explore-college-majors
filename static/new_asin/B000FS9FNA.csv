2583115,5,B000FS9FNA,"I'd been looking for the DVD copy of Kathy's Aerobox video for quite awhile. My VHS copy saw me through several years of fitness obsession until it finally died on me, and I was so sad that I couldn't find it on DVD. Imagine my surprise when I get the Cardio Knockout and find Aerobox hiding on there! Aerobox is a pretty hard workout (and you can't easily modify it to be low-impact), but its broken down into a bunch of segments, so the time actually goes pretty fast. Its a nice way to add some intensity to your workout routine, although I wouldn't recommend it if you have bad knees and joints.

The kickboxing workout is great too, but nothing can take the place of Aerobox in my heart.",1188000000,3,692,4.323076923076923
2583116,5,B000FS9FNA,"The two main workouts on this DVD, kickboxing and aerobox, are perfect for days when you want to sweat.  They really get my heart racing!  The Tai Chi at the end is good, too, but it's much shorter than the others - it consists of a 6 minute energizing sequence and a 6 minute stretch.  I do the Tai Chi after a boxing workout, but I don't tend to do it by itself.

I appreciated the fact that both of the boxing sessions had introductions in which the main moves were demonstrated slowly, and proper form was explained.  After doing the workout a couple of times, it really isn't necessary to watch the intro each time, of course, but it's nice to have them there for future reference.  The instructors offer good tips and reminders throughout the workout to help you keep proper form.  In both cases, there is an expert working with Kathy for these intros.

The two boxing sessions are complementary in that the emphasis in the aerobox is more on the upper body, while kickboxing focuses more on the lower body.  Both workouts also work the core effectively.  These are both really excellent cardio routines.  In both workouts, you learn combinations of moves from the introductions, and after doing them slowly, you repeat them up to tempo several times.  (Don't let the word ""slowly"" there fool you, though - it's all relative.  They are fast enough that my heart rate stays up while learning the combos, and then I really have to push myself to do them at full speed.)  I like that the combos, while challenging, aren't complicated in terms of their choreography. I was able to pick up on them pretty quickly.  If you don't like having to learn all sorts of complicated ""dancey"" choreography to get your heart rate up, I can definitely recommend this DVD.

Because of the jump rope, much of the aeroboxing is high impact, and no low impact alternative is offered.  (I do this part of the workout without a rope - I just jump as if I had one.  One of the boxers on the DVD is doing this, too.)  The kickboxing actually has fewer high impact moves, and in this case, low impact alternatives are offered.

One thing that I really appreciate about this one is that each workout is broken up into chapters that can be selected from the DVD menu.  I've used this to mix and match workouts.  The last time I used this DVD, for example, I did the kickboxing warm-up and cardio workout, but I still felt like doing more cardio, so I just did a couple of the segments from aerobox without having to scan through the intro or the warm-up from that workout.  Then I went back to the kickboxing to do the short leg and core strength segments and the cool-down before heading to the Tai Chi based (very relaxing!) stretch.

I should note that there is an error on the box: it says that the kickboxing workout is 120 minutes, but it is actually about 50 minutes.  For me, that's a good thing - I rarely have 2 straight hours to devote to exercise - but I thought it was worth mentioning here.",1186531200,14,2982,4.447513812154696
2583117,4,B000FS9FNA,"I'm not a DVD workout person, but I have to say that this one is easy to follow, and raises your heart rate to an intense level.  It allows you to build up to a very strenuous workout.  The label on the back of the DVD case is misleading however, it says that the Kickboxing Workout is approx. 120 minutes, when in reality it is only 50 minutes.  I'm not sure if this was a misprint.  The other two workouts are labeled properly.",1175126400,12,429,4.132530120481928
2583118,5,B000FS9FNA,"Really hard but enjoyable workout.  This  is the first Kathy Smith DVD I've ever bought as they're not widely sold in the UK, but she's a briliant instructor and this particular DVD is very highly recommended.",1174867200,2,209,4.777777777777778
2583119,2,B000FS9FNA,"I was not happy with this DVD.  I purchased this DVD because on the back it said the 2nd kickboxing workout was approximatly 120 minutes..in reality, it is only 40 minutes.  I was looking for a longer workout and was not happy spending my money...felt a bit cheated.",1174521600,8,266,4.520833333333333
2583120,5,B000FS9FNA,This was well worth it. Three well-planned workouts that are intense but simple enough to do. They lead you through the moves so that anyone can do it. And the variety keeps you from getting bored.,1169769600,2,197,4.5
2583121,5,B000FS9FNA,"This DVD is a compilation of two previous Kathy Smith releases, Kickboxing Workout and Aerobox, and buying them together is a great deal!  The Kickboxing workout is appropriate for beginners but will challenge intermediates as well, and the Aerobox workout will leave intermediate to advanced exercisers sweating.  I have broken down the two programs in detail below.

The Kickboxing Workout was my first-ever experience with kickboxing, and I've loved it ever since. The program begins with Ketih Cooke, a well-known kickboxer, providing simple explanations of each of the punches and kicks that will be used in the workout. Kathy then takes over, leading you through a 10-minute warm-up. Next comes the 25-minute kickboxing work. During this section, you will practice punches and kicks, starting slowly and then building up to a faster pace. Kathy gradually works up to basic punch-kick combinations which are simple to learn yet to fun to do.  At the end of this section, two short combinations are presented by Keith Cooke and another well-known instructor, Keli Roberts. Following the main workout, there is a 5-minute segment of kicking drills, a nice stretch using a chair, and finally a 5-minute bonus abs/back segment (not sure why the stretch came before this).

Aerobox is a tough boxing working combined with jump rope drills to up the intensity even further. Although Kathy is present in a leading role, the main instructor is actually Michael Olajide, a boxer.  Prior to the start of the workout, Kathy and Micheal review the moves which will be used during the routine and discuss proper form.  The workout begins with a warmup lasting just over 7 minutes. In this section, you will perform simple punches combined with side steps and plenty of twists to begin raising the heart rate; the warmup ends with some basic upper and lower body stretches. The next section, standing boxing, is the longest segment at 11 minutes. Here you will concentrate more intensly on the punches, and  Michael introduces some double-time moves. Following this comes ""Stick and Move 1,"" a 4-minute segment which adds some simple footwork--mostly via boxer's shuffles--to the boxing movements. Next comes the first jumprope segment (4 minutes)--it's very challenging even without the rope!  A second ""Stick and Move"" section follows, this one only 2 minutes but with some quicker footwork. The next jumprope segment lasts 5 minutes, with the moves becoming a bit more complex. The final ""Stick and Move"" section is also only 2 minutes and again involves quick footwork; the final 4-minute jumprope segment ups the intensity and impact even further by adding some jogging and knee raises.  During the ""Aerobic Cool-Down,"" you are still doing punches and some footwork, but at a much slower pace. The 4-minute stretch segment brings the total workout time to 50 minutes.

Again, this DVD is really a great deal--as always, you get excellent instruction by Kathy Smith, fine guest performances by Michael, Keli, and Keith, and two all-around great workouts.  Highly recommended!",1162857600,51,3070,5.167338709677419
2583124,3,B000FS9FNA,"I bought this DVD because it was only $5.00 and it contains two workouts in one (actually, a third short Tai Chi thing with Kelli Roberts that I have not watched nor done). I have done both the kickboxing workout with Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke; and I've done the aerobox with Kathy and Michael Olajide. In fact, I bought this DVD because of Michael Olajide. I watched Michael's ""Killer Abs"" on Netflix, and in retrospect, I should have spent the time and money looking for this DVD.

Other reviewers have done an excellent job at describing in detail what the work outs contain (elements of the workouts, duration, etc.). I want to focus why I was disappointed with the DVD and gave it 3 stars in spite of some really good content:

1. The aerobox work out is terrific in its simplicity--old school boxing jump rope, shadow boxing, punching drills and technique. If you really put effort behind the punches, you get a great cardio workout (in this respect you can make it easier or more challenging of a workout). Michael makes it all look easy as does the boxer to his right (left on your TV screen). I spent a good deal of time looking at the boxer to Michael's right because he demonstrates (and his clothes really emphasize) what Micheal describes as good technique. Some of the presenters on this DVD are wearing dark colors but they wear shorts and cutoff shirts (I mention this because, in other DVDs presenters who wear dark colors or loose clothing are difficult to study). Perhaps what makes this DVD most difficult to study is the dark lit stage (on both the aerobox and kickboxing workouts the lights are dim in my opinion, the background colors are dark, etc.). The aerobox workout is particularly bad at the special effects, again, making the study of any of the models difficult. When I drill along with the DVD I usually try to visualize what I'm doing along with the presenter doing the drill (I don't have a mirror in my work out room so this is the best I can do to try to do the moves ""correctly."" The camera cuts away, keeping the beat (so annoying) or a special effect that looks like grease on the camera lens obstructs a portion of the screen--you can see some presenters but not all. Also very distracting was the number of presenters in the aerobox workout 6-8 people. The camera moves around so much, I guess to give everyone camera time. For me, all of this is very distracting from the work out (some folks can tune this out, I can't). I spent way to much time looking at Kathy making mistakes, falling behind, use improper techniques that I couldn't wait to finish. Also, it was difficult to hear Micheal's voice.

2. Kathy Smith. I've never worked out to any of her DVDs and I won't in the future. I have read many reviews where the reviewers are annoyed by the presenters (either their style, lack of technique or experience, their voice specifically, their repetitive too enthusiastic and high pitched words or encouragement--any Leslie Sansone fans out there?). Particularly, Kathy's cheerleader-esque ""one more taaaaaaaime!"" really got to me in the kickboxing workout. If you watch her carefully, her wrists break form when doing kicks (granted, this DVD is about aerobics using kickboxing moves, not a study of kickboxing, however it goes to credibility/experience of the presenter, IMO). There are six presenters in the workout, only Keith and another male performer in the back row wear shorts, again, good models to study form. All the ladies wear long, black or dark, pants. The presenters constantly mention how important it is to not overextend joints in kicks and punches, but if you can't see the move...ugh.

3. The pace. The kickboxing portion of the DVD reminds me too much of Tae Bo--in it's pace. It's fast. Some of the moves, punch-kick combos or punch-move forward/side combos bother parts of my body (knees and back) so I typically modify to correct. Also, transitions seem awkward that it felt more like I was learning a choreography. I felt rushed to try to keep up--forget form or technique. One good way to tell is by looking at other presenters, if they look like they're struggling or trying to figure something out, more than likely, the move is awkward and you're not alone. Kelli Roberts is a good one to look at for this--even though she is just following Kathy along like the rest of us, she looks awkward doing some of the moves especially the faster combos I mention above. I don't know Kelli Roberts or her kickboxing experience; but I've watched her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Kickbox-Bootcamp/dp/B000A3DGG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution - Kickbox Bootcamp</a>&nbsp;and she looks knowledgeable to me.

Two things I DID like about the kickboxing portion is that when introducing a new move in the work out, two pop-out windows would appear with Keith Cooke in two different camera angles, describing good technique and what not to do. This is a really good way to study form during the work out.  Wait, that's the ONLY thing I did like about the kickboxing workout; oh, and Kelli Roberts.

If you're curious about kickboxing or boxing cardio/aerobic workouts or are a total beginner to kickboxing and can tune out annoying camera angles, moves, special effects as well as Kathy's voice then you will enjoy this video. It is an excellent primer, a decent workout to get your heart going, easy to modify routines during workout. If you're like me, observing the presenters to study form, and are easily annoyed by the presenters high pitched voice and have no way to silence instruction and select ""music only"" (from an interactive menu which Cardio Knockout does not have) then you will hate ""Cardio Knockout"" and wish you had kept your 5 bucks or will only do the Aerobox portion of the DVD on mute.",1344816000,6,5850,4.84984984984985
2583125,5,B000FS9FNA,"This is one of my favorite workout DVDs. It gives a good all-round cardio workout, along with good kickboxing instruction with emphasis on using proper form.

2583126,5,B000FS9FNA,"This is a great workout,I used to own it on VHS,then had it on DVD my little one broke it and I ordered it again,cause it is very effective.the rope jumping session with or without the rope is a killer but very motivating.excellent DVD for when you want to vary the routines.",1316476800,,275,4.3076923076923075
2583127,5,B000FS9FNA,"Kathy brings in a pro boxing coach to help her take this one. It's an awesome workout it will definitely get your heart rate right up, especially the skipping section. Not good for people with bad knees though as there's a lot of jumping and lower body work. But excellent for cardio. This is my only exercise dvd that my husband will do with me! A great one to have in your collection.",1311984000,,386,4.301369863013699
2583128,5,B000FS9FNA,"Aerobox was one of my favorite workouts and couldn't find it in DVD format but so happy I did, under new packaging.  Item was received in a timely manner and the workout is as fun as I remembered it.",1308355200,,199,4.102564102564102
2583129,1,B000FS9FNA,This shouldn't be called a Kathy Smith Dvd because she just does the workout while other trainers do the training. It's not fun at all and is actually quite boring.,1300320000,,164,4.5
2583130,5,B000FS9FNA,"I've used this for more than 10 years, getting a DVD version that includes the aerobox workout, too (which my husband will do). It's a solid and motivating routine that focuses more on kickboxing than on doing kick-box-style, dancy aerobics, so form and function are emphasized. Beginners can follow this with some gentle modifications or stepping out for a bit and get a killer workout, intermediate exercisers will get a terrific workout and advanced exercisers can still get a decent 45 minutes with this. If you've done some of Janis Saffel's videos, it's not as tough or as long (which is often a good thing), but it's a lot more serious than many kickbox-based routines - I love all three trainers and they're serious about the exercise.
One thing to note: Kathy completely leaves out one stretch on one side of the body, so you need to leave yourself an extra minute to make sure you do that - I think it's the hip flexor on one side. Otherwise, great class. Reminds me of taking a great kickboxing class at a gym, but with the slightly more moderated and forgiving cuing and encouragement of a great DVD instructor.",1293494400,,1123,4.6767676767676765
2583131,5,B000FS9FNA,"I've done martial arts in the past so I wasn't sure if this would be too basic.  Kathy kicked me in the rear and ate me for lunch.  Well done!  I couldn't finish the kickboxing workout on the first try, I look forward to conquering this DVD and feeling fantastic.

If you have limited space for working out this might be a problem, I have to shift myself around to have enough room.",1288137600,2,382,4.191780821917808
2583132,4,B000FS9FNA,"This workout might be old school but it is def. a great workout, that will get you sweating.
I am not currently able to workout to this DVD anymore but used to workout 5-7 times a week and this one was still one of the harder workouts I did!!!",1284076800,,243,3.979591836734694
2583133,2,B000FS9FNA,"I didn't like the jazzy camera angles or color changes at the beginning of each section.  Too much time is spent putting flashy images on the screen and you have to wait around for the workouts to start.  I expected more from the Tai Chi workout, like actually feeling ""focused, energized and refreshed!"" as claimed on the cover.  This workout was WAY too minimal.  Not being familiar with aeroboxing or kickboxing, I'm not surprised that I couldn't keep up at first, but, I think Kathy's pace makes adjusting for your fitness level difficult.  You really need to already be familiar with these moves, or at least really coordinated.

Basically, this purchase was a disappointment.  I don't recommend it.",1269648000,,704,4.915254237288136
2583144,5,B000FS9FNA,"If you love advanced workouts, this one is for you. This is a fabulous workout and well worth the money. It is a hard workout, there is a killer jump rope section, but your body will love you for it! If you like to sweat, try it!",1266796800,2,229,3.893617021276596
2583145,5,B000FS9FNA,This video well give you a total workout and I have the sweat drenched clothes to prove it. This is an excellent kick boxing DVD. All workouts are started off slow and then increase so that you can get the hang of it. I consider myself at an intermediate workout level and this had me all worked up. I will be trying other videos by Kathy Smith,1265241600,,344,4.149253731343284
2583146,4,B000FS9FNA,"This video has three seperate workouts, an aerobox workout, a kickboxing workout, and a Tai Chi workout.  I bought this video because the kickboxing portion of the workout had good reviews and I will agree that the kickboxing session was fun and did a decent job of raising the heartrate.

The first workout is a 55 minute aerobox workout.  This is a workout that I doubt I will ever do again because I did not really ever feel that I was getting a good cardio workout.  The workout begins with a warm-up with punching and a twisting ab move that is probably great for slimming down the abs.  This was followed by a section of more boxing moves along with basic footwork.  There are then three jumprope sections (6 minutes, 5 minutes, and 4 minutes long).  The jump rope sections are the only really cardio portion of the workout. This is followed by some more footwork and punching drills and then a stretch and a cool down.  I admit to liking kickboxing more because the combination of kicking and punching really raises the heartrate.  The jump rope sections would be hard on anyone with knee trouble.  Also, some of the punching sections are performed pretty quickly and a beginner might injure themselves.

The kickboxing section is a not very difficult but extremely effective workout.  I enjoyed this workout and I will being doing it again.  This workout had an approximately 10 minute long warm-up and then 25 minutes of kickboxing.  The moves are not very complex and there is enough instruction for a beginner to pick up the moves. Following this section, there was a 5 minute lower body workout where you practice the kicks by holding them out while holding on a chair for balance.  These ""slow and hold"" kicks were something we always did in karate classes and are very effective for toning muscles.

There was a third bonus Tai Chi workout on the tape that I tried before bed.  It was an enjoyable way to relax and it was relatively short.

This kickboxing workout is a good workout for an beginner to intermediate exerciser.  I would skip the aerobox workout. The Tai Chi is a nice alternative to yoga for relaxing with at night.",1262131200,4,2144,4.639257294429708
2583147,4,B000FS9FNA,"The Good: I liked all the different choices this DVD gave me.  There are plenty of workouts to keep things from getting boring.  The boxing drills are good - the kickboxing is fun.  Both are challenging and I definitely had a slow learning curve with the jumprope drills!  I like Kathi's enthusiasm and energy.  Her guests (Keith, Kelli, and Michael) give solid advice in a limited time frame (in other words - doing the best they could given that this is a DVD not an actual class).  It's nice having the Tai Chi option as well - Keith does a nice job with that segment.  Great for focus.
The Not-as-Good:  It's not an actual class and some of the kicks are better learned from an actual martial arts instructor or other qualified instructor.  (Injuries are possible if your form is lacking.)  Kathi is great - again - but she's doing ""workout style boxing"" not ""fighting form boxing"" (lots of flying elbows, dropped hands, and one direction to punch to your opponent's knees.  ?!  Yikes.)  Don't think of this as a substitute for proper self-defense knowledge - it's just a real fun workout.  The music is also a little bit dated, but that's just nit-picking!

I liked it for workout purposes and as a supplement to my martial arts training.  I always work up a good sweat and I'm in pretty good shape.",1254441600,,1304,4.556034482758621

My main issues would be that: this DVD is insanely slow in some parts; it can get so ridiculously repetative that even making it through one workout is a task; the shots of the hosts go inexplicably in and out of black and white or sepia; Kathy Smith herself can hardly keep up in a fluid motion and flops around so much like a spastic ragdoll that even if the picture stayed on in color you would be hard-pressed to follow her lead; and finally all of the above really combine to one irritating waste of money.",1245110400,8,711,4.227941176470588

2583150,5,B000FS9FNA,"The ""Kickboxing Workout"" is by far my favorite kickboxing video. I use it over and over and I never get bored with the routine. It is approx. 40 minutes (although it says 120 min on the back cover which is incorrect). I like the class setting and the students and upbeat music help to keep the workout interesting. I recognized Keli Roberts in the video (she has short hair and is tough, tough, tough), but I don't recognize the others. The time flies by with Kathy Smith's instructions and you'll definitely work up a sweat and burn calories with this workout. You will work on your punching and kicking and your skills will improve if you use this video.

You also get a longer kickbox routine with professional boxer Michael Olajide and a short Tai Chi stretch routine with Keli Robers and Tai Chi movement routine with Keith Cooke. I don't use these as often although the stretch routine is nice to add to the 40-min Kickboxing Workout I mentioned above.

Keith Cooke and Kathy Smith give great instructions on how to kick, punch etc. properly as not to increase the risk of potential injury. I found the workout to be fun and different. The Aerobox workout was actually pretty intense. When I first watched it, I laughed at how easy I ""thought"" it would be. Needless to say about 20minutes in I was on the couch with water.

Although the moves here are easy enough, the pacing is bad.  Just when i'd start to get in a nice rhythm & have a chance to maybe break a sweat, the segment would end.  Then she spends all this time talking & showing how to do the moves so you are standing around waiting.

The kickboxing workout is great, but has become a bit of a light workout for me. I keep it because I can use it on lighter days, but if you mastered kickboxing workouts, this won't wow you. I do love Kathy, but others lead the workouts for the most part.",1356739200,,393,4.397260273972603
