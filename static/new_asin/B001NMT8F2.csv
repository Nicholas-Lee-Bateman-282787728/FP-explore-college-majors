It is  a politically charged movie but unlike the 1 star review implies, I do not see it as merely left or right as we see democrats shown in the role of large business money baggers as well. The important issue is are the facts presented true?The disturbing answer is not only easy to find.
Case in point is another fantastic movie called Orwell Rolls In His Grave. I had the good fortune of watching it a couple years back. It not only shows the parent company of the parent company of each available media outlet, it also names names of who is on the board of directors of each company. Coincidentally many of the same names appear on each, even the ones considered ""competitors"". Also coincidentally, is that the movie is no longer available through Netflix or Amazon !!!",1293840000,5,845,4.487012987012987
3719809,5,B001NMT8F2,"I completely enjoyed this movie and learned something too! I knew the FCC has some dubious practices, but I didn't realize the full scope of their efforts, or that they were using such strong arm tactics.

A real eye-opener. Thanks DJ Him and DJ Her for a well researched (and funny) first person account of these events.",1276041600,3,321,4.631578947368421
3719810,5,B001NMT8F2,"Before viewing this movie I thought to myself ""who even cares about radio now that we have internet?"" But that was the wrong question. The real question is ""do I mind if the government takes away my 1st amendment rights?"" and the answer is yes I do. This is a smart documentary done with wit and humor and a lot of heart. I urge you, in the strongest possible sense to do yourself a favor and check it out.",1275955200,10,406,4.151898734177215
8327435,1,B001NMT8F2,"I knew a pirate broadcaster in high school. I loved his quirky little station. I was hoping to see more of such stations in this program. Instead, I was assaulted by the sanctimony of spoiled children (and a few other self-righteous ne'er-do-wells) with nothing better to do than pretend they are doing something of social value. As long as mommy and daddy foot the bill, hey, what's not to like? Do something of REAL social value, like join the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps VISTA? Not these kids. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.",1423094400,,526,4.666666666666667
8327436,1,B001NMT8F2,"If you're looking for any sort of history of pirate radio broadcasting, don't waste your time on this film, which is basically a documentary about pirate radio operations amongst the filmmakers and their associates in the late 1990s. Within that limited scope, it's a failure overall - just not interesting, very myopic and dated. The film feels more like some self-congratulatory ""look what we did"" than a serious documentary about what pirate radio is.

As a person who has listened to pirate and clandestine broadcasting since the 1970s, I can tell you this film is nothing more than fuel for the ""kids playing radio"" cliche that is often used to describe pirate operators. Everyone comes off as some sort of middle class kid who thinks they are entitled to alleviate their boredom by putting on a radio station to puff their ego.

A documentary like this does more to hurt the cause of pirate radio than to help it.",1412380800,,919,4.773584905660377

8327438,2,B001NMT8F2,"This DVD, despite having high quality production values, was very disappointing as far as content is concerned.  No mention of the European pirate stations of the 60s (such as Radio Caroline or Radio London), as well as no mention of one of the most well known US pirates, Radio Free New York.  I was expecting a tour of pirate radio stations around the country, which I admit there is a smattering of - a small pirate in Tucson, one in Seattle, and another in far off northern Washington state.  80 percent of the video is a coverage of demonstrations, protests etc of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, a visit to speak to an FCC official, dissatisfaction with the LPFM process, a meeting with NPR officials, an outcry against big media dominating the airwaves and a congressman speaking about the radio business.  Next to no coverage of pirate operations, how to start a pirate station, film clips of FCC raids where pirates are shut down, etc.  If you're looking for that type of content, take a pass on this DVD and look for a different one on the subject.",1397952000,2,1075,4.636842105263158

8327440,5,B001NMT8F2,"This movie was filled with great music from the 60's.  My husband and I grew up in the 60's...we loved the movie.  Costumes were true to the era as were hairstyles, etc.  It brought back that  feeling we all had during that time that it was us vs. the establishment!  Very entertaining.  Brought back a lot of memories.",1388102400,,319,4.413793103448276
8327441,5,B001NMT8F2,"an excellent history of underground radio, and the corporate influence over media at the expense of citizens.  Lots of info to research and follow up on. Pirate radio:  it's not just for entertainment!  FREE THE AIRWAVES!",1380931200,,221,5.083333333333333
8327442,1,B001NMT8F2,"Do not waste your money.  There was a movie entitled ""Pirate Radio"" that was just fantastic, this is not it!",1371513600,,108,4.4
8327443,3,B001NMT8F2,"The rater who gave this flick a 1 should learn to read a movie's description before making a purchase. If that individual thought for a second this was the movie about the pirate radio station off the coast of the UK, the person simply cannot read. As for the accolades of the 5s, they miss the mark, too. The film is not that great.

The film is good, but that's it, just good. It's a low budget documentary, and there's no problem with that. In fact, DJ Him and DJ Her do a whole lot with the little they spent producing the work. I found it fairly informative and socially poignant. It highlights the injustices of the FCC in how it perpetrates mega-media corporate control of the airways. It even provides a little bit of variety by highlighting some of the personalities at the forefront of the micro-broadcasting movement, similar to what was fondly known back in the day as Pirate Radio.

The problem with the film is that they spend a lot of time (way too much) covering the WTO demonstration/riots in Seattle back in 1999. A lawyer screaming at a cop or miles of footage showing protesters and out of control vandals destroying property really distracts from the overall theme of the film. They simply spent too little time on the subject purported to be offered, that of Pirate Radio. Additionally, I would like to have seen information about the development of the movement, other than just a diatribe on how FCC injustices fueled it. The history of Pirate Radio is essentially ignored. Also, there really is no discussion of the technology used in microcasting.

The documentary is definitely worth a watch. Just don't expect too much.",1325894400,2,1647,4.692041522491349
8327444,5,B001NMT8F2,"As a pirate radio DJ (THE DICEMAN) This is a great Documentary. Since this movie many have moved to the Internet unregulated and unrestricted. The FCC and NEA are becoming the dinosaurs that they are. For Instance over the internet I can broadcast not within a couple of miles but world wide - anywhere you can hook up a computer - Ive broadcasted from New Jersey,Florida,Ohio,Texas,New York,Oklahoma,West Virginia,Indiana and Delaware. Keep up the good work..",1315612800,2,460,5.1466666666666665
