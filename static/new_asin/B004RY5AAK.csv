4461766,5,B004RY5AAK,"I was a bit dubious of my ability to learn photography off a dvd, I've outlayed over $2000 for a Canon 7d and some good lenses. So I thought if I pick up one good tip it will be worth the price tag of $20...I got my $20 worth in the first lesson on how to reduce camera shake and the rest was a bonus.. I'm shooting my first wedding in a month and I can't wait..",1304121600,2,362,3.7142857142857144
4461767,5,B004RY5AAK,"After buying almost every book I could get on photography and borrowing tonnes from the library as well I was starting to think I would never be able to take good photos.
This Dvd was a lifesaver, I could learn the settings and then go back over when I didn't quite get it, I almost never shoot on auto now after years of using my Canon 40d as an expensive point and shoot.
Don't do what I did and wasted loads of money on books, get Bryan Peterson's, Understanding Exposure and this Dvd and you will improve 100%",1303603200,13,513,4.244897959183674
4461768,5,B004RY5AAK,"I was surprised at the completeness of this course. A DVD course for photography makes a lot of sense to me. It doesn't take a degree to get good at photography but it does take some fundamentals. I had the idea that I get a cheap digital camera - after all, for under $100 you can get a 12 MegaPixel camera these days with amazing features - and then the camera does all the work. Arrgh! What I found is that a camera with lots of bells and whistles and one that shoots in high resolution simply makes my MISTAKES look more obvious in High Def!!! So this was a welcome course because it didn't just explain to me what exposure, reflectors, framing, ISO, and the like ARE but it explained to me WHY I needed to master those to make my photographs look stunning. It is much simpler to learn from a DVD than a book, and the Complete SLR Photography Course proves why.",1302652800,4,865,4.248484848484848
4461769,5,B004RY5AAK,"There is a lot that separates a good photographer from a bad one - and an ""average"" is is usually bad.

Still, it doesn't take a college degree to move your skills up several levels. I was a little surprised at how much I learned in a SHORT TIME from this course. For example, in low lighting I didn't realize that the way I hold a camera makes a difference. But holding a camera is really a weak point for me anyway, all the tips and techniques on holding a camera properly to reduce blurs and shakes did my photos a WORLD of good. I'm a photographer for our company and I think I got that gig inside the firm only because at the time I was one of the few who had extra time to do it. My boss kept putting me on the jobs and I did get better but I needed this course to move to a ""good"" shooter. HIGHLY recommended.",1302652800,4,816,3.975609756097561
4461770,5,B004RY5AAK,"This DVD is money well spent. I looked at taking a beginning photography class, but the cost was too high. It's a passion I always had, but never had the time and money to put towards it. I decided to try this DVD course. It has pretty much everything you need to know about the camera functions, how to use them and what not to do. Also there are really good tips on how to take great photos explaining artistic rules, lighting issues and blurry or fast action shots. Some of the lessons towards the end moved a little fast, but I think once I get more familiar with my camera it will become clear. I will always have the DVD to refer back to. The music is a little corny, but I guess it helps move the lessons along.",1302652800,3,718,4.135714285714286
4461771,5,B004RY5AAK,"I think that calling this video The Complete SLR Digital Photography Course is a little bit of a stretch. However, It is a great video for an absolute beginer and well worth the low cost of the video. It's packed full of very usefull information and tip's the beginer will find extreamly helpfull.",1351296000,9,297,4.622641509433962
4461772,2,B004RY5AAK,"The DVD came with a lot of hype, ""The complete SLR Digital...."".  If you have no experience with a DSLR, you will come away with little more than you went in with.
Very basic, lessons too short, waste your money else where.",1343865600,4,223,4.309523809523809
4461773,3,B004RY5AAK,"To call this DVD ""The Complete SLR Digital Photography Camera Course"" is a bit too strong. It refers to basic operations, far away from a sophisticated media guide, good for those who are initiating on the SLR world.",1343347200,7,216,4.7105263157894735
4461774,4,B004RY5AAK,Lots of information on this dvd ! Easy to follow and understand for the entry level photographer. I find it easier learning from a dvd rather than reading the instructional guide. This dvd has it all and covers everything if not more than any manual I have read. Good Job !,1339718400,,273,4.372549019607843
4461775,4,B004RY5AAK,I found this video to be very helpful on learning  my camera and it also gave good tips on how to make photos better.,1337212800,,117,3.875
4461776,4,B004RY5AAK,i have been into photography for many years...but i always feel that there is things that i can learn...this video have lots of different episodes that show different aspects of photography and giving you hints and tricks in photography...very good video..,1336262400,3,256,5.2682926829268295
4461777,5,B004RY5AAK,A nice overview of the Digital SLR camera. I think there are probably better books but not at such a reasonable price.,1331856000,3,118,4.409090909090909
4461778,5,B004RY5AAK,"I've caught the photography bug badly and I've stocked up with a Canon g12, CAnon 7d and the twin lens kit, my only problem was I'm working overtime to buy a new flash and I don't have time to go a class on photography so i thought a DVD was my best bet, I could watch it when I finished work, most dvd's were around $60 plus and i found this gem for only $20, I picked up great tips for both cameras and some really solid composition tips as well, .",1319414400,7,450,3.902173913043478
4461779,1,B004RY5AAK,"I am not a negative person who likes to crticise or say negative things, but this is a field I take seriously. DO NOT waste your money on this video. Sound, picture, and commentary are elementary. It was actually taxing to watch the first ten minutes, and I couldn't watch anymore. I'm not even going to try to finsih it, it was that terrible.",1319068800,7,343,4.375
4461780,5,B004RY5AAK,"Very easy to follow and pick up quickly, I'm not a quick learner and I couldn't understand from a book without seeing it in a practical situation, learning from a DVD is an easy way for me because when i had trouble i just rewound and watched that part again, I have a canon 60d and finally i have got it off the auto settings.",1314057600,3,327,4.046153846153846
4461781,5,B004RY5AAK,"I have enrolled in 2 separate courses on photography but with 2 small kids I missed some vital lessons so I bought this DVD, it was great
I could watch and learn after I put the kids to bed, 5 stars plus.",1313884800,11,204,3.880952380952381
4461782,3,B004RY5AAK,"Hi

The information on this DVD is fine, something not right about the way it flows though. I struggled initially following this and an explanation of terms upfront rather than at the end would have been better.",1313884800,3,211,4.702702702702703
4461783,2,B004RY5AAK,Although I am a beginner I have learned very little from this course. For a total beginner I would reccomend the Canon Digital Photography Workshop interactive CD-Rom. The most comprehensive course in the market is the 15 DVD set by Vince Wallace. It is everything one will ever need to become a professional photographer (it costs $100 but it is worth it).,1313020800,2,357,4.774193548387097
4461784,5,B004RY5AAK,"If a had a quid for every photography book and manual I've read and not understood I'd be a rich man today, thank god I was recommended this DVD, simple easy to understand and none of the pro talk which I can never get my head around. I had my Eureka moment on the spot metering, no more over exposed shots now..Great for beginners and intermediates like me ..",1312070400,17,360,4.231884057971015
4461785,5,B004RY5AAK,"I have been interested in photography for well over decade now. The first time I used a dslr was back in 1996. I have taken college courses in photography and managed a photography lab, as well as several website portals. I can tell you that from my experience this is one the best DSLR courses out there. I really like the fact that the course is designed on a DVD instead of a book. It makes much more easy to follow, takes less time, and the lessons you need to learn are easier to understand. I would like to thank the author for making this course available, I will recommend it to all our 100+ professional photographers. The DVD arrived quickly, well packaged. It's a high quality dvd. Very happy with this purchase!",1311811200,3,723,4.443609022556391
4461786,3,B004RY5AAK,"I bought this video for my wife who is interested in getting started learning photography. She is a complete novice and needs/wants to learn SLRs from the ground up. Given all the excellent reviews this video was receiving, I decided to get it for her. For a complete novice, this video is a big disappointment. It assumes a basic knowledge of how cameras work -- it doesn't cover the basics of what an SLR is, what it means when you change shutter speed and aperture, etc. It does, however, make copious use of that terminology very early on with no explanation given. My wife was constantly asking me, ""What does that mean?"" In my opinion, this is not a beginner's video and thus the ""Complete"" in the title is misleading. You should start with a more basic photography video/book/course and then step up to this once you've got a good foundation.

For someone between a beginner and intermediate (like me), I think this video will definitely improve your photography skills and have you taking better pictures.",1311638400,17,1013,4.755681818181818
4461787,5,B004RY5AAK,"Excellent course, covered everything I needed to know and more plus its renewed my interest in photography again, I've bought a few of the recomended lenses and I can notice a huge difference in my images.",1306022400,2,205,4.722222222222222

4461789,5,B004RY5AAK,"Good solid course, covered everything from the settings on my camera to composition of photos, I'm not about to turn pro, but I've finally figured out how to shoot my son's soccer games properly. Highly recommended! A+",1304899200,2,218,4.918918918918919
4461790,5,B004RY5AAK,"This is a very informational guide, I have been working with video for a while and wanted to go to stills. I was intimidated by the camera, and really did not have the time or patience to read a manual. I was not confident in what I needed to do with it to get good shots. This gave me the skills I need to get a professional shot. I went into photography as a hobby inspired by my friends who take it more serious. I visit so many great places and people, now I can get the shots to come out even better than before, it amazes me how different the photos look when you can make those small adjustments that you wouldn't learn about unless you went to a photography school. Great program!! I'm a visual learner, and with this you can watch and also follow along hands on with your camera.",1304812800,2,788,4.1568627450980395
