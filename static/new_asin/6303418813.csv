7846834,4,6303418813,"Brad Davis plays a U.S. marshall who is 1/4 Kiowa, and so understands the native Americans. The plot is a bit formulaic as it establishes that the outlaws are very bad people and deserve whatever happens to them. We also see native Americans as people who possess honor, integrity and a sense of fairness. Davis as usual is not really at ease with his acting, but he is okay. This western is unlikely to make your top ten, and contains nothing that memorable, but could be enjoyable & interesting to watch.",1339545600,4,506,4.571428571428571
