This is one of Columbo episodes that has stayed in my memory for more than thirty years. The last scene of SUITABLE FOR FRAMING is very well made with a bad guy who believes until the very last moment that he has managed to deceive Columbo. The other strong points of the episode are the performances of Ross - Dale Kingston - Martin, Don Ameche and  Mary Wickes as well as the first scene of the episode when the characters of the paintings on the wall seem to observe the actions of the murderer.

7838915,5,6303129137,"There's something about the Columbo character that makes these movies fun to watch.  I can't think of any other tv character that has this type of charisma except maybe Elizabeth Montgomery of Bewitched.  This show is a true classic that it as good today as it was back in the early 70s when it first came out.

This episode is good because it's related to the art world which provides the perfect setting for Columbo's antics.

The ending to this one makes it one of the better episodes.

These stories are completely impossible and could never happen in real life.  But somehow that doesn't seem to make any difference.  It's the acting and portrayal of human nature both good and bad that makes them interesting.  Those things are real.

7838916,5,6303129137,"Ross Martin starred as Artemis Gordon in one of my favorite shows of all time: ""The Wild, Wild, West."" Seeing him duel with Columbo is a treat. Whereas Artemis was laid-back and mischievous, Ross Martin's portrayal of art critic Dale Kingston embodies the worst traits of a professional critic: cold, calculating, manipulative and arrogant. He makes the perfect antagonist for the rumpled detective. Kingston appears to cover all his bases, leading everyone (but Columbo) to think what he wants them to think. For awhile, he even stymies the great detective. But in the end, he is shocked to discover that Columbo has been one step ahead of him, besting the art critic with what has to be the most unexpected piece of evidence in a surprise ending! I never tire of watching this episode!",1007510400,10,787,4.880597014925373
