Politically incorrect in every possible way, rude, crude and lewd detective Torrente will have you laughing in very short order. Santiago Segura, who plays Torrente, satirizes everything - including himself. Middle-aged, fat, bald, unshaven, slovenly, bigoted, conniving, incompetent and conceited, Torrente is the ideal antithesis of the man of action in this action movie.

While the first Torrente (Torrente: El Brazo Tonto de la Ley) is good, I found this movie to be even better. The humor is enhanced in Torrente 2 with the addition of the sidekick character, Cuco.  Every hero needs a sidekick - and so does every anti-hero!

Rather than prattle on, just do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  If you don't find it funny, you're either dead or the next best thing to dead. Enjoy!",1357862400,,843,5.0
