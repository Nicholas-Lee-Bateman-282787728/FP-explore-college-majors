8175274,4,B000N6UFE2,"Although this is half the length of other Shu Qi VCDs which display the au naturel, village girl-who-lives-by-the-sea visual delights, the photography is high quality in its staging for the most part, which endlessly repeats the adoring camera work to a Yanni-like soundtrack in French most of the time. Although other VCDs of hers appear to be made with a studio casting agent in mind, this one is more like a Richard Avedon model shoot on an exotic locale where Shu Qi is cast in shadow or against a glowing light to great effect with slow adoring sweeps of her, always returning to a beach sunrise or sunset. Half-way through they insert split-photo highlights which remind you of the snazzy bikinis she wore (probably Body Glove) to balance the au naturel shots early on. The second half repeats to formula overlaid with another French-sung soundtrack which adds another measure of class to the production that has improved photo-montage work throughout. Although the soundtrack is not 5.1 stereo, it is an enjoyable accompaniment to her visual charms. I wish there was more footage of her lounging on white sand in Ray Bans in various (Body Glove perhaps) bikinis briefly shown in the first half of the program. No model wrapped her slender form into a motorcycle as comfortably as she without collapsing the bike. From this video alone Shu Qi probably sold dozens of bikinis and Harleys and should be at an exotic beach living off the royalties.",1399248000,,1451,4.8785425101214575

8175276,5,B000N6UFE2,"Her real name is Lin Li-Hui, and mine is Lin Chen-Chu, so we have the same surname- Lin. (In China, the surname is first.) I would be proud to claim her as a cousin or a sister. She is so beautiful and so sexy. I already own several of her movies, and this is one I can share with my boyfriend. This movie and another one we own starring her are ""Pinups"" with sexy nude scenes. I can appreciate a fine female figure, and she has one at 5'-6"" with 34""/24""/35"" figure I have heard. I have seen her mostly in Chinese movies, but she is in ""The Transporter"" with Jason Statham. What can I say? My boyfriend and I love this great movie with such a Chinese goddess.",1358208000,,659,4.116279069767442

8175278,4,B000N6UFE2,"This video montage of the winsomely alluring Shu Qi takes place primarily in a seaside setting. She models in an assortment of colorful bikinis as well as in nothing.  An audio track consisting of mellow rhythms and a female vocalist singing mostly in French (there's some English too) plays from beginning to end. The shoot is tastefully done, the vibrant colors of Shu Qi's swimsuits, her lithe form in various poses, and the sparkling sea captivating the eye.

The nudity is Playboy-mild; there are some nice shots of her cute rear and countless more of her breasts. You'll also catch glimpses here and there of her well-trimmed bush, and in chapter 6 you'll be pleasantly surprised to get a quick but close look at her tight nether lips as she does a pirouette (keep your finger on the pause button). As usual she wears a demure expression, though a subtle look of naughtiness deliciously replaces it from time to time.

Solid camerawork brings out the glamour girl's loveliness, but the excessive jumps from scene to scene can be annoying. The full-frame picture is generally good, affording a rich color palette as mentioned earlier and fine detail in close-up shots. Long shots tend to be less clear. Some of the scenes were filmed indoors, where soft images are the norm, but the effect is pleasing. The company's logo, the letter ""W"" for Wide Sight Entertainment, appears fixed on the upper left-hand side of the screen and cannot be removed. I didn't consider this a major distraction, though finicky viewers might. There are two audio options: 5.1 and 2.0. I used the latter for playback on a pair of tower speakers: the stereo sound is clear but lacks presence and dynamics.

For fewer scene cuts and more lingering shots of Shu Qi, you might want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shu-Qi-Dreaming-Naked-Show/dp/B000GRU9VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shu Qi: Dreaming Naked Show</a>; in that video she also appears sexier and more kittenish. As for picture quality, however, this title trounces it.  The French soundtrack doesn't befit the visual context too well, but this is not a major setback. Despite the shortcomings, True Woman delivers plenty of eye candy and should please most oglers of beautiful women. 3.5 stars.",1257465600,34,2289,5.1924119241192415

8175280,4,B000N6UFE2,"I was surprised to see that Shu Qi made a video that showcases her natural beauty.  This video was made before Shu Qi starred in movies such as So Close, Georgeous and The Transporter.  There is no talking in this video, just Shu Qi posing in front of the camera with some annoying music in the background.  But if you love Shu Qi and want to see her in all her natural glory, then this is a DVD to get.",1243209600,12,403,4.0125

Nevertheless, the female form as art has pretty much withstood the test of time even when it is au' naturale. The various poses she strikes are anything but pornagraphic. Making such an assertion is demeaning to the art ever so apparent. Times change. Such beauty is art and is timeless; such is the case here.",1200268800,17,430,4.746666666666667
