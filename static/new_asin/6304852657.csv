7878967,3,6304852657,"Being a big fan of Yun-Chow Fat I thought this sounded interesting.  It had the expected violence, but it was hard to muster any sympathy for the woman who seeks asylum at Peace Hotel.  If he had thrown her out of Peace Hotel, breaking his inviolate rule, I certainly would have understood.",1381881600,,290,4.5576923076923075
7878968,5,6304852657,"I thought this was a great movie.  The story was an interesting idea, only matched by the great supporting case.  Chow Yun Fat, as always, shines.  My only criticism is that the ending falters a bit.  I do not want to spoil it for everyone, but it almost seemed anti-climatic, and not in the best direction.  But regardless I thought it was great and enjoyed it.",1175040000,,362,4.424242424242424
7878969,5,6304852657,"""Peace Hotel"" is a great movie. Chow Yun-fat's acting in this movie is unquesitonably wonderful. I am a big Chow Yun-fat's fan, but I didn't like any of the movies that he made in the U.S. It was a shame that this was the last movie that he ever made in Hong Kong.",1102896000,,264,4.0
7878970,3,6304852657,"THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF CHOW'S MOVIES, IT'S A PERIOD PIECE, AND ONCE YOU GET IN TO IT YOU WILL LIKE IT.  IT HAS A FUNNY ROMANCE STORY THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL AND THE FEMALE LEAD WAS GREAT FOR CHOW'S CHARACTER!  THE ENDING IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO INTEREPT IT!!",1014940800,,311,4.344827586206897
7878971,5,6304852657,"After Full contact, chow yun fat made a few mistakes, or so i've heard. God of gamblers return (which I haven't seen), and treasure hunt(critically hated, i personally enjoyed). Apparently, Yun-fat was so eager to have  another hit, he wrote the story himself, and a great one it is. A sweeping  Hong Kong ""Eastern Western"", I found the cinematography  breathtaking, and the montage where chow yun fat and cecelia yip fall in  love particularly touching. My only problem in the film was that it tried  to be too much of an epic in an hour and a half, it was probaby rushed. The  finale stands up there with A Better tomorrow 1,2, and the killer as one of  chow's final moments of blazing glory.",932688000,4,694,4.548387096774194
7878972,4,6304852657,"Peace Hotel was Chow Yun-Fat's last HK movie.  It was fun to watch, but at times the movie seemed to lose its focus on the plot.  But with an actor of Chow's caliber, the movie still works.  The ending is incredible...Chow  shows the viewer what a real man is...watch it and see what I mean.",925171200,6,291,4.236363636363636
