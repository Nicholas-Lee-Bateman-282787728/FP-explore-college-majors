8484882,5,B005SGVSNY,"This was an interesting different look at the 2004 red sox season.  Monica is a passionate sox fan, you can feel her emotions as the season unfolds. This was really done well and will compliment your Red Sox dvd collection nicely. Highly recommended! Not much else I can say except if you have the other red sox 2004 dvds, this is essential.",1514419200,,341,4.5
8484883,5,B005SGVSNY,"This Red Sox DVD is one that you must have! Take the journey through the 2004 season & into the Red Sox 1st Workd Series Championship, with a different view & memories all together!",1359676800,,181,4.352941176470588
8484884,5,B005SGVSNY,"two boston red sox fans with their camera in hand, have the good fortune of picking JUST the season that their team go on to obliterate their 86 year losing streak (a.k.a. ""the curse"")by winning the world series and to add icing to the cake, embarrassing their arch-rivals the new york yankees by doing something a team has never done in play off history-coming back from 3 games down to win four in a row to advance to the world series.

monica and ges ride the red sox roller coaster of the 2004 baseball season attending every game and filming the highs and lows that made up that fateful season.

if you are a red sox fan i'm sure you've probably already watched and approved of this fun and exciting, and sometimes down in the dumps filmic diary.

but for future generations of sox fans who will have only heard of the glorious 2004 season, this film will help to put them right there in the park, not to mention mucho scenes filmed right outside the hallowed brick walls of Fenway and even one fantastic stroll through subterranean players-only halls-monica walking with jim rice.

as to one other reviewer complaining that monica was nothing but annoying, i'd like to say that one of the main reasons compelling me to write this review was to differenciate from that complaint to state that monica was fun, intelligent and overall a delight.  annoying?  i have to completely disagree.

that unhappy reviewer SHOULD have written his comments as 'in my opinion, monica was annoying' and he/she's entitled to their opinion. as am i. and i give this film a very high thumbs up!",1157241600,,1580,4.641577060931899
8484885,5,B005SGVSNY,"The real-life characters, as genuine as they come.  The cinematography, stunning.  The interviews, priceless.  The rivalry, as real as it gets.  This movie is New England baseball.",1139875200,,180,5.555555555555555
8484886,5,B005SGVSNY,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was SO refreshing to watch a movie about real people.  I am so sick of watching A list celebs act like they feel something.  The stars in this movie are really Red Sox fans and they really love each other.  This shows you why reality tv is so successful - people want reality right now and that is what they relate to.  This has all the elements of a great movie - drama, music, love, sports and a fantastic back drop - New England.  Buy it - it is a classic and could be worth quite a bit someday.  It is something you should have and save for future generations.",1139788800,,597,4.094827586206897
8484887,5,B005SGVSNY,"You don't have to be a Red Sox fan to love this movie!!  I grew up in Pittsburgh and have a special place in my heart for the Pirates--no matter how bad they are.  I knew little to nothing about the Red Sox when I watched this movie, and I loved it!!  Wait Til This Year takes you through the ups and downs of being a devoted baseball fan.  It's a great documentary of the Red Sox combined with the story of a married couple, Monika and Ges, who are diehard Red Sox fans.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone!!",1139616000,,514,4.0495049504950495
8484888,1,B005SGVSNY,"To Red Sox Nation:  This movie is just another example of the Red Sox taking advantage of a loyal fanbase to make money.  As for the movie, the main character is extremely annoying, to the point where you want to tear your fingernails off.  I wasted two hours of my life and my hard-earned money on this disgrace.",1135296000,2,313,4.362068965517241
8484889,5,B005SGVSNY,"Night after night, year after year, I often asked myself why I kept doing this.

  The answer was always quite simple. Baseball is a perfect game, played at a perfect time of year, and in watching it one can relax and just enjoy it all. You win some, you lose some. The season is never long enough.

  That the Red Sox are my home team might be incidental. As Monika Lahiri knows, though, it doesn't stay incidental for long.  If yoy take the time to watch (and enjoy) the games, the season takes on an importance that seems, at least, life defining.

  Monika and her husband Ges Selmont were lucky enough (smart enough) to film their experiences in the 2004 Red Sox season, and the Red Sox co-operated.  They won the World Series (but not before taking us all down that one-way street we always faced and always fear will end in inevitable doom).

  This film tells it like it was from  fan's point of view.  We know the day-to-day standings, we see the good, the bad, the usual.  For good measure we meet Sox greats Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Dwight Evans (the Red Sox really did co-operate), and share in a very funny incident concerning pitcher Bill Lee who thumbs a ride with two best friends, one a Red Sox fan, the other a Yankees fan.

  We get the feel of the season and learn what it meant to a couple who were there at every game (Ges sometimes wondering  if they really should be there at all).

  This is marvelous cinema verite. It's probably made mostly for Red Sox fans, but it's really a great document of baseball itself.",1135036800,2,1541,4.402135231316726
8484890,1,B005SGVSNY,"This is an awful movie.  Monika is completely annoying, I can't believe this has been made into a DVD.  I shouldn't be surprised, as the Red Sox will turn anything into a DVD in order to make a quick buck (Ring Ceremony, three DVD's after the world series victory). I highly recommend avoiding this movie.",1134691200,2,305,4.527272727272727
8484891,5,B005SGVSNY,"I loved this movie!  Any New Englander can immediately identify with the heroine, Monika, as she truly lives the trials and tribulations of the Boston Red Sox team in their amazing championship season.  The film includes incredible interviews with Yaz, Jim Rice and Dwight Evans, plus a quirky ad-libbed cameo by Bill Lee. There is also beautiful cinematography of every state in New England and a fantastic soundtrack.  This docudrama is fun, intelligent and passionate about the Sox.  You've got to see Wait Til This Year",1133222400,,523,5.046511627906977
