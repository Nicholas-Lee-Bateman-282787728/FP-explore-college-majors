8317536,2,B001L7XFPS,This DVD was like a brief overview of Black History in New York. I was disappointed; it should have been longer and more comprehensive.,1238112000,,135,4.666666666666667
8317537,5,B001L7XFPS,"I was very impressed.  There are some facts(?) mentioned that I was not aware of; specifically, free black people in New York around the same time, or before European immigrants.  I told some co-workers about this DVD, who's families immigrated to New York.  They are anxious to see it.  Next question.  Should I let them borrow mine, or make them buy there own.  We'll see how much they really are into history.",1233792000,4,412,4.652777777777778
