7879700,3,6304951167,"OK, so I had heard a lot of positive things about this group of five short films. Espicially, the mainevent short ""Cutting Moments"".

However, just like just about every other ""shocking and groundbreaking"" film I hear about, it winds up being a let down. I'll quickly break down the shorts for you:

Crack Dog: A fast paced 6 minute short that gets things underway. The cheap gore effects are quite humorous, and lull the viewer into a sense of security that the rest of the films are going to be silly fun like that. Nothing special, but people that are into D-Grade style gore will get a smirk out of it. 2/5 stars

Don't Nag Me: What follows is a boring, and horrendously-acted short about a war veteran that kills his wife and gets nagged endlessly by her after death. Really poorly done. 0/5 stars

Bowl Of Oatmeal: A dark and creepy piece about a lonely man whose bowl of oatmeal encourages him to get out and get a hobby. The final shot of the man is undoubtedly creepy and a little sad at the same time. But a little more backstory into the man's life would have been good, and the film just felt a bit empty. 2.5/5 stars

Principles Of Karma: Dated but enjoyable short. Good character development done in a short period of time, an extremely unexpected twist and a well-written short to boot. Also, gamers will notice the cable guy is played by Roy Earle from LA Noire. The best of the shorts. 3.5/5 stars

Cutting Moments: Horror fans the world over have been telling me how amazing this film is, and how brutal it is. Don't buy into their nonsense. It is gory, but nothing that brutal when you compare it to a film like ""Antichrist"". It really is a massive letdown. The acting is alright, and I really liked the way they explained why she went to the extremes she did and built it up, but it still doesn't deliver what so many critics and horrorbuffs have told me. 3/5 stars",1311638400,3,1885,4.417867435158501
7879701,4,6304951167,"Five strange little horror films that, thanks to the inventiveness of the filmmakers, manage to rise above their obviously limited budgets. I received this from a friend on a double-sided DVD that also includes the movie Buried Alive. I watched this first, expecting it to be the lesser of the two, but hopeful, considering the Tom Savini quote emblazoned on the box art, that it might surprise me. It certainly did, and for a freebie, there is no cause for complaint. The acting - all seemingly from 'semi-professionals' - is uniformly awful, the effects cheap and nasty, but the ideas more than make up for that. Other posters have gone into the plots in detail, so I won't bother, but I agree that Bowl Of Oatmeal is the least enjoyable segment. Interesting, but not as much fun as a crack-smoking mutt or a nagging old biddy driving her murdering husband nuts! The final titular short is thoroughly nasty, and even I, a David Cronenberg fan, had to watch it through my fingers! If you don't find the sight of a woman cutting off her own lips with a pair of scissors disturbing, I fear for your sanity...

My only question would be the year of production. There are next to no credits on the end of the Region 2 DVD, and although IMDb claims this was made in the late nineties, the cinematography (and the shot-on-home-video knife-slashing interludes between shorts) would suggest it was all made on the cheap - perhaps as student films - in the 80s. In fact two of the films have clear 80s references; the old couple's gravestones say they died in 1987, and the teen-movie short has repeated references to Breakfast Club star Molly Ringwald, for example - not to mention very dated hair styles and clothing. Have they tacked on four 80s flicks to the recently successful Cutting Moments short to make a feature? (If that's the case, what has happened to these filmmakers, who show a lot of promise in this collection?) Or are they all from the nineties and the two films I mentioned are 'period pieces' - Principles of Karma being a parody of the 80s teen-movie, for example? I hope someone else can update IMDb to ease my curiosity...

But anyway, if you can forgive the poor production values and you like macabre tales, you're in for a short, sweet treat!",1120867200,2,2262,4.638403990024938
7879702,5,6304951167,"Cutting Moments is an amazing film.  It is profound, bold allegory and it will move you.  I've really never seen anything like it and I cannot wait for the opportunity to see another one of Douglas Buck's films.
The other standout is Bowl of Oatmeal which is just hysterical.  I don't remember who directed this, but I would love to see more of his/her stuff as well.  Dark, dark humor!",1082419200,2,386,4.4714285714285715
7879703,5,6304951167,"Great little group of 'short movies' compiled in one great package. The first 4 vignettes are very good, but the coup-de-grace is the final installment -- 'Cutting Moments'. Without spoiling it, suffice to say that this is a chilling little tale without much dialogue to get in the way. Visuals from this movie will haunt you for days after viewing them. Quite a feat nowadays. I highly recommend this film.",1016064000,4,407,4.828571428571428
7879704,5,6304951167,"Douglas Buck is a twisted genious.  this dead pan, grizzy look into the all american family life, leaves you deeply disturbed and disgusted.  this is tradgy at its' finest.  desperation at its' peak,  and the truth is all too chilling.  this film is a deep look into what every family fears. this could be your neighbors. or even worse,  you.  we always hurt the ones we love.  check this flick out. it will leave you speachless afterwards,  and scarred for life.",979862400,5,463,4.617283950617284
