After going through the lessons on the first tape, I experienced an overwhelming since of completeness!! A load of questions I had about the program were answered in the first 15 minutes!!
I'd never really did much of anything with the program except open it and look at it with a blank stare until now! I felt as though Lynda and David were my personal tutors! The video and audio quality are excellent! The lessons flowed well enough to keep even me interested. If you are a Flash 4 ""Beginner"" I highly recommend these tapes. I was so sold on the beginners series I went ahead and got the Advanced Flash 4 tapes as well!
Anyone wanna buy some hardly used Flash 4 Books?? :-)",972691200,,816,4.375
7795691,3,0966822943,"The learning flash 4 tape lasts around 7 hours, the beginning of the tapes describe whats in the manuals, tweening, symbols, etc. If you learn faster by watching then it will probably help.  The aspect of the tape that  bothers me is that  Lynda will describe a technique, say motion tweening,  then David will explain how thats changed in V 4.0 and then show you how to  do it faster. Why not just show us the 4.0 way and stop wasting time with  3.0 methods. Nice coverage of tell target, bandwidth profiler, and a good  example of preloading methods. IMHO the tape would be better if it  explained in detail the newest features, and left the intro stuff to the  manual and the other Flash books out there. It would have been nice to  include an index so you can fast forward to the topics you want to see,  also the audio quality on the tapes is horrible. Too bad Freehand 9.0  wasn't out when the tape was made since coverage of that would have added  another star to the review.",953769600,10,982,4.359116022099448
7795692,4,0966822943,"This video series is full of very helpful information.  The set focuses on design concepts as well as tips and techniques.
This video series walks you through the essential features  of the  authoring tool, including Drawing Tools, Importing Bitmaps and Vectors,  Creating Animation, Creating and Working with Symbols, Creating Interactive  Buttons, Rollover Button Techniques, Streaming Sound and MP3, Editable Text  Fields and Forms, Setting Variables, Preloading and Bandwidth Profiles, Web  Integration, and much, much, more.
For those who want to get the absolute  most out of Flash 4.0, and see how it works rather that read how it works,  I recommend this video series.",951868800,,676,5.423076923076923
