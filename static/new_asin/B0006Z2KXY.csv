2197213,4,B0006Z2KXY,"Warner Brother's unleashes a galaxy of stars in its new Comedy Collection box set. Six films of impeccible pedigree - two in deluxe special editions, flesh out this collection; ""The Philadelphia Story"" and ""Bringing Up Baby"". In addition there's much to admire from ""Stage Door"", ""Dinner At Eight"" and ""Libeled Lady."" Only Lubtisch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" falls somewhat short of expectations - though it too is a welcomed sight on DVD.

Plots in totem:

""Dinner At Eight"" (1933) is the tale of a society matron, Millicent Jordon (Billie Burke)who is so enraptured at the prospect of throwing the society party of the decade that she eschews all other concerns in favor of the frivolities associated with such a swank soiree. Her roster of guests include the boorish social climber, Dan Packard (Wallace Beery) and his much younger wife of hot body but low class, Kitty (Jean Harlow), aging grand dame of the theater, Carlotta Vance (Marie Dressler), family physician, Dr. Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe) and desperate has-been movie actor, Larry Renault (John Barrymore). Millicent's husband, the kind-hearted, good natured Oliver (Lionel Barrymore) has just discovered that he is fatally ill. However, acknowledging his wife's lack of feeling for anyone but herself, Oliver decides to forego divulging his diagnosis, presumably until after the party.

""Bringing Up Baby""(1938) is the adventageous screwball comedy about a madcap New England heiress, Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) who, after accidentally running into stuffy zoologist, David Huxley (Cary Grant) is determined to land him as her husband. Not that David would notice. He's too concerned with acquiring a bone for his museum collection - go figure.  But a gregarious little terrier named George (actually Asta from ""The Thin Man"" series) intervenes in David's plans, burying the irreplaceable fossilized bone somewhere on Sue's country estate. Meanwhile Baby, Susan's leopard, threatens the whole show by tearing up the scenery, as leopard's will do, after escaping from her cage. Naturally the whole mess winds up in front of a local magestrate, who lacks the ability to put two ideas together and come up with one coherant thought.

""The Philadelphia Story""(1940) concerns itself with the pending nuptuals of Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) to George Kittredge (John Howard). Tracy's previous marriage to C.K Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) ended badly, but shows signs of coming back from the dead when Dex turns up to pitch a little rice this time around. But the plot thickens in an unexpected way when Tracy decides to go after tabloid journalist Mike Connor (James Stewart) on a drunken binge and midnight swim - leaving both groom and ex feeling left out.

""Libeled Lady"" (1936) is a sparkling romantic comedy of errors. When committment shy newspaper editor, Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) finds that his newspaper is being sued for alleging that a socialite, Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) is a home-wrecker he delays plans to marry his fiancee Gladys (Jean Harlow) yet again, by placing her in the midst of elegant playboy, Bill Chandler (William Powell). The idea is to have Gladys and Bill marry so that Connie will then be fooling around with a married man - hence Warren's paper will be off the hook for printing the initial story. But the plot goes hopelessly and predictably awry when Gladys starts to have genuine feelings for Bill and he for her. So what's a struggling foursome to do?

Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be""(1943) has to be the most genuinely bizarre political satire to emerge from Hollywood's golden age. It stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Joseph and Maria Tura - a married couple and stage performers living in occupied Poland during WWII. Determined to alter the course of the war, the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis.

And last, but not least is ""Stage Door"" (1937), treading familiar backstage heartache and dismissal with unfamiliar panache and a killer cast. Wealthy socialite, Terry Randall (Katharine Hepburn) wants desperately to break into Broadway theater only she wants to do it on her own. So Terry decides to go slumming, secretly checking into a theatrical boarding house populated by sharp shooter, Judy Canfield (Lucille Ball), wise girl, Jean Maitland (Ginger Rogers), and Eve (Eve Arden) and Annie (Ann Miller), a couple of stage struck kids...almost. What Terry discovers is that life upon the wicked stage might be the nearest thing to heaven, if only she could manage to get closer to the stage itself.

All of the discs in this box set have had some restoration work performed on them. The two outstanding transfers are ""Bringing Up Baby"" and ""The Philadelphia Story."" Both are 2-disc special editions mastered from very clean film elements and jam packed with lots of extra features. Contrast levels are superb. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are fully realized throughout. Film grain is kept to a bare minimum. The good people at Warner Brothers deserve a pat on the back for their formidable efforts. As for the rest; they are a mixed bag at best. with inconsistently rendered black and white images, sometimes weak contrast levels and hints of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering. Extras on these latter disc are bare bones to say the least. Even so, this box set comes highly recommended. It contains films we are not likely to see again on DVD and presented in transfers, that while lacking among the very best that DVD is capable of, are nevertheless head and shoulders above what previous VHS incarnations have offered to the home video market. A big and sincere ""yes"" then for these.",1109289600,39,5747,5.0283613445378155
2197214,5,B0006Z2KXY,"This is truly amazing!

A friend of mine is a major reviewer for an L.A. periodical and received an early copy of this 6-movie, 8 Disc, boxed set.

It is nothing short of a miracle....

At last BRINGING UP BABY on DVD. Looking gorgeous, for the first time ever. Well worth the wait. Grant and Hepburn's genius never shown more brightly. The bonus features are as exciting as the feature.

You get THE MEN WHO MADE THE MOVIES: Howard Hawks, Richard Schickel's great docu from the '70s as updated a few years ago.

Even better is filmmaker Robert Trachtenberg's magnificent Cary Grant profile called CARY GRANT: A CLASS APART. It's so brilliantly done, that it shows how dumbed-down we've been by the endless barrage of rotten, paint-by-numbers A&E shows.

Last, but not least, is a feature commentary by the genius Peter Bogdanovich, who knew Hawks and Grant, and loves the movie, and has great things to say.

So that's just movie #1....

Onward to special movie # 2...a Two-Disc remastering (significantly better than the old DVD) of the Cukor masterpiece that re-teamed Grant and Hepburn and joined them with Jimmy Stewart, the classic PHILADELPHIA STORY. It's a treasure, with a wonderful commentary by Jeanine Basinger, another Schickel MEN WHO MADE THE MOVIES about Cukor, and the unforgettable Hepburn cinematic self-portrait KATHARINE HEPBURN: ALL ABOUT ME.

But that's not all...

There's Kate and Ginger and EVe Arden and Ann Miller and Lucy and Adolph Menjou in Gregory La Cava's STAGE DOOR looking truly magnificent.

Moving on is master Ernst Lubitsch with Carole Lombard's final performance with the legendary Jack Benny in TO BE OR NOT TO BE, again looking better than one could hope for.

Then the MGM all star crew steps in. Both John and Lionel Barrymore, Jean Harlow, Marie Dressler, Billie Burke, Marie Dressler, and a cast of dozens of brilliant artists bringing Kaufman & Hart's wonderful play DINNER AT EIGHT to the screen.

It looks luscious. A Documenary about Harlow narrated by Sharon Stone adds to the fun.

Harlow appears again along with such luminaries as William Powell & Myrna Lot and the wonderful Spencer Tracy in LINELED LADY.

It's amazing! These 6 great movies, beautfully presented, for an

unreal price! It's a perfect gift for yourself, or your mom or dad, or anyone who loves great, timeless filmmaking. Without surprise WB keeps raising the bar for how classic filns should be presented on DVD!",1109030400,94,2436,4.948402948402949
2197215,5,B0006Z2KXY,"Amazon lists this collection as having seven discs but if one enlarges the picture of the cover, it shows that both ""The Philadelphia Story"" AND ""Bringing Up Baby"" are the two-disc editions.  Two double-discs plus the other four movies should add up to eight discs.  DVD Journal and DVD Planet list the collection at eight discs, so hopefully that is correct because it would be a shame to get this collection without the extra goodies for ""Bringing Up Baby""!

All the movies in this collection are enjoyable no matter how many times you watch them.  I've practically memorized every line in ""Stage Door"", and I'm dancing in the heavens over this compilation (yes, the Calla Lilies are in bloom again!), especially for ""To Be or Not To Be"" (a masterpiece in my book) and ""Bringing Up Baby."" I would have personally preferred that they had put in ""Holiday,"" a Kate Hepburn-Cary Grant classic that is sadly underrated, over say, ""Libeled Lady"", but I don't want to be finicky.  I'm very pleased.  Extremely pleased!  YESSSSSS!!",1109030400,33,1025,4.85632183908046
2197216,5,B0006Z2KXY,"This is an excellent collection of classic comedies.  In my opinion, with both the Dinner at Eight and The Philadelphia Story - Two Disc Special Edition DVDs included in this six movie assortment, their worth alone is more than offset by the cost.

2197217,5,B0006Z2KXY,I had seen this set at Barnes and Noble where they are selling it for $70.00 if I'm not mistaken. I went on Amazon and bought it for $44.99!

2197218,5,B0006Z2KXY,"I love old movies.  This is a great collection of comedies that you wouldn't be wasting money on. All of them are wonderful to watch, and who can't use a good chuckle.  Amazon does a wonderful job in placing orders along with getting your item before the time indicated.  Thanks Amazon.",1202428800,,286,4.568627450980392
2197219,1,B0006Z2KXY,"Shame on Warner Brothers for calling this collection a COMEDY Collection.  And the other reviewers - where's your candor?  Yes, Philadelphia Story is a classic comedy.  But DINNER AT EIGHT, which has a few (a very few) funny moments, is, in fact a very dark story involving suicide, hateful marriages and people at the end of their means; with no particular redeeming quality.  STAGE DOOR, it had funny moments, yes, but always with a very sad, dark suicide looming. TO BE OR NOT, this is like a skit, a joke, being stretched out to an hour and a half. LIBELED LADY was funny, but hardly a CLASSIC.  BRINGING UP BABY is screwball comedy, but we all know that this was NEVER considered a CLASSIC.  My recommendation (now that I feel bad I spent so much based on the other reviewers) - buy the films you know individually.  One at a time.  PHILADELPHIA STORY is a MUST HAVE.

Then you can laugh at the rest of us for buying movies we'll never watch.",1178323200,3,947,4.459302325581396
2197220,5,B0006Z2KXY,"I just recently finished watching all of the movies in this boxed set, and I couldn't be happier with it. Warner's has been going boxed set crazy over the past couple of years, boxing up into collections just about every movie in their vaults. Some collections are good, and some not so good, but this one is excellent. Three of the movies are well known, and the other three are less known. Probably the best known film is ""The Philadelphia Story"" that got Katharine Hepburn out of her ""box office poison"" era for good and won James Stewart his only Best Actor Oscar - about two or three Oscars shy of what he should have had in my opinion.

""Dinner at Eight"" is a 1933 ensemble comedy using the ""Grand Hotel Formula"" that had won that film the Best Picture Oscar the year before. It is a comedy revolving around a group of people preparing to go to a dinner party and shows how their lives strangely intertwine beyond even their awareness. Remarkably, I don't think it even got nominated for an Oscar, but it has held up well over time and has one of the best last lines of any movie ever. As everyone is planning to go into dinner Jean Harlow is telling Marie Dressler how she has been reading that machinery has been taking over everything and soon they would all be replaced by machines. Marie Dressler looks Jean Harlow up and down as only she could do and says ""My dear I don't think you need to ever worry about that.""

""Bringing Up Baby"" has Katharine Hepburn playing a scatter-brained young lady who gets Cary Grant involved in her inane plot to transport a tame leopard her brother sent her to her country estate. The film moves at such a fast clip with so much going on that it seems exhausting, but it is great entertainment. This film actually didn't catch on that much until years later.

""Libeled Lady"" was the pleasant surprise of the bunch. I had never seen it before but it was quite funny. It all revolves around a false rumor about a young lady that gets reported as truth in a New York paper. The paper faces a libel suit and financial ruin if a way is not found to set up the ""libeled lady"" so that she appears to be in a genuine scandal, thus lessening the paper's chances of losing in court. This film has some great physical comedy from William Powell of all people.

""To Be Or Not To Be"" is a comedy set in World War II Poland and involves an attempt by the occupied Poles to stop a spy from getting to German headquarters with the names of members of the resistance. It pairs Carole Lombard with Jack Benny, but strangely enough the combination does work.

""Stage Door"" is a very good film about a group of women living in a boarding house all trying to make it on Broadway. I'm not sure what it is doing in a set of comic movies, though. It is actually more of a melodrama than a comedy, though it has some very witty banter between the struggling actresses at their rooming house and a great performance by Adolphe Menjou as a sophisticated cad, which is a part he played so well in several films of the 1930's.

There are bonus discs included with ""Bringing Up Baby"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"". ""The Philadelphia Story"" includes a feature on Katharine Hepburn's life and career, and ""Bringing Up Baby"" has a second disc that has a similar tribute to Cary Grant. There are also features included on the directors of these two films. My advice is to buy this set. It's a tremendous value and will give you many hours of entertainment.",1174262400,3,3465,4.41471048513302
2197221,5,B0006Z2KXY,"I defy you to find a modern day movie where the wise cracks are funnier than any thing you'll find in each and every one of these 70 year plus old movies!  Most of the dialogue was spoken at Tommy Gun blast speed, with every word clearly enunciated - a feat in itself!  All the men are mostly in suits or tuxes, and the women wear the most beautiful outfits, created by the top designers in the world at the time.  Visually, these movies are a feast for the eyes.  It also helps that most of the actors and actresses were considered the most handsome and beautiful at the time. Hey - I can get ugly at home! The quality is also excellent considering how old these movies are.  I'm an old-movie buff and I remember browsing the TV guide when I was a teenager and then setting my clock to get up at 3am to catch one of these movies whenever they were on.  They still hold up and now I can watch them whenever I want and I am grateful.

The ""extras"" are often quite wonderful, an extraordinary Hepburn autobiography-documentary ""All About Me"", an excellent documentary on Cary Grant, good vintage cartoons, short subjects, trailers, etc.  I'm reviewing each DVD separately since they are sold that way (have already posted a review of BRINGING UP BABY) to be more detailed but I bought the set myself and I'm very happy with it.",1139702400,9,702,5.043103448275862

Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story are the main films but it's important to remember how big Dinner At Eight was in the early 30s.  To Be or Not to Be is the most recent and lampoons the horrible Nazi regime as it takes overs Poland.  Libeled Lady and Stage Door are also wonderful.

8043836,4,B0006Z2KXY,"All of the films in this collection are worthy of preservation but there are a few things to note for those who are not familiar with the titles:

- ""Dinner at Eight"" is a depression drama with a great cast of  unpleasant and selfish characters, with the exception of Lionel Barrymore who hosts the dinner. The film is remembered as a comedy because of the indelible impact of Jean Harlow and Marie Dressler, who are hilarious, peaking when they meet for the memorable and justly famous ending.
- ""Stage Door"" is also heavy drama set in wisecrack heaven, a boarding house for aspiring actresses. While you can savour the endless one liners, be prepared for some pretty heavy melodramatics which climax the film.
- ""To Be or Not to Be"" is one of the funniest and maybe one of the most tasteless comedies of all time. Brilliant Ernst Lubistch dared to set a comedy among the Nazis and was justly criticised by a squirming public.  Today we can sit back and enjoy Jack Benny and Carole Lombard without the repercussions.
- ""The Philadelphia Story"" is the film which really set Katharine Hepburn once and for all on the road to immortality and is a streamlined showcase for her. Remembered as a comedy, it has some very serious moments and a cynical view of the wealthy.
- only ""Bringing up Baby"" and ""Libeled Lady"" are outright screwball comedies. The former was not a great success in its day, the latter a smash but ""Baby"" has become a cult classic with its relentless Katharine Hepburn and a harrassed Cary Grant. The cast of ""Libeled Lady"" are outstanding.

The prints of the films are variable from the gloss of ""The Philadelphia Story"" to the really dirty print of ""Libeled Lady"".  Both Hepburn films are Special Editions so there are excellent commentaries and biographical documentaries on Grant and Hepburn. There is also a moving documentary on Jean Harlow included in ""Dinner at Eight"". The trailers are usually included for each film and there are some cartoons along the way.

This would be a 5 star package if all the prints had been restored.",1212105600,9,2054,4.7075208913649025
