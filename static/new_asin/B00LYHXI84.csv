6516153,1,B00LYHXI84,"The only reason to watch this movies is for the fantastic glimpses of Santorini at the
end of the movie. Other than that, even if you are a fan of war movies, this is
a really bad one.
The plot is bad, the special effects are bad, and for snipers the move really fast!
The first part of this series back in 1993 was a descent movie, and Berenger was
not that old. So I recomend that you watch that instead of this one.
The only reason to watch this movie is if you watch all the previous 3 (I should have stopped
at number 2)",1412553600,,525,3.9622641509433962
6516154,5,B00LYHXI84,"This DVD is so far the best of the series. Tom Berenger is excellent and plays a complex role offering aloofness,  yet caring role of a father.  Chad Michael Collins (Sniper:Reloaded) is like a breath of fresh air. And, Mercedes Masohn as a""Sanaa"" and Dennis Haysbert as the ""Colonel are welcomed additions. This is one to rewatch to grasp the intracacies of the storyline. And, the scenes of ""Greece"" are beautiful. Oh! And there's just enough action, bloodshed and gore to keep the viewer captivated.",1412208000,9,502,4.894117647058824
6516155,5,B00LYHXI84,"I was very impressed with this and out of the series in my opinion this ranks #1 and it starts off kinda slow but gets very good fast and once the action started picking up the action became no holds barred and non stop. And the ending was what I thought would happen and more but I give this two giant thumbs up and my ranking of the sniper series goes in the order from the best to worse here we go in my opinion 1. Sniper legacy 2. Sniper 3 3. Sniper 1 4. Sniper 4
5. Sniper 2",1412121600,,479,3.8
6516156,4,B00LYHXI84,"I thought this was really impressive especially for straight to DVD. Yea some of the dialogue was cheesy and the plot was a little thin. To me that makes this a throwback to 90s action movies which I LOVED. I thought that this movie was fun to watch and I liked that it didn't try to be something it wasn't. I also really loved that the female sniper played by Mercedes Mason (whom I love) wasn't there just for scenery. She wasn't a damsel in distress or a love interest. She was a seriously badass shooter. I realize it was a stretch to have a female scout sniper but I think that was the point. So yea, all in all I really liked the movie.",1412121600,13,642,4.144
6516157,2,B00LYHXI84,"""One shot, one kill."" Brandon Beckett (Collins) is an elite sniper following in his father's footsteps. When he finds out that a rogue US sniper has been taking out high ranking military officers he wants to find a way to stop him. When he finds out that his dad, the legendary Thomas Beckett (Berenger) was one of the victims it becomes personal. Collins is on a quest for blood but when he is ambushed he is surprised that his father is the one who rescues him. Now the two of them together must not only stop the assassin but figure out who it is and why he is doing this. I have to admit that I have seen all of the other movies in this series but I don't really remember any of them. To me that's not the sign of a good movie. They are all pretty much the same thing and a little too slow for me. My son has really enjoyed these so we sat down to watch this together. I had to fight to stay awake and so did he. When it was over his only comment was the last 15 minutes was good the rest was really boring. I have to agree, when you watch a movie called Sniper you are looking for action and suspense. This one focused too much on the father/son aspect which normally is a good thing but the writing and dialog were not the best and the movie just seemed to drag on and on. There was a lot of planning scenes and not enough action scenes for either of us to stay interested in. Overall, fans of the others may like this but be prepared, there isn't as much action as you have come to expect from this series. I give it a C+.",1411862400,5,1529,4.016393442622951
6516158,2,B00LYHXI84,"IMHO any decent military movie flies or falls on technical accuracy / realism. I had hoped for an improvement on the earlier movies in the franchise, which I could barely watch, being IMHO B graders with many gross inaccuracies, At least there was some improvement in technical issues from the earlier movies. (at least the correct reticules and systems etc). However still pretty weak; ridiculously attractive female spotter looks at her Kestrel wind meter when asked for a range (twice), very understated ballistic effects from the .50 cal impacts, ridiculously poor concealment techniques that no half decent sniper would own up to, numerous examples of tactical trade craft that was anything but! To top if off the common US movie implication that only US military personal are any good, showing a supposed UK Green Jackets sniper as an undisciplined idiot and a poor shot. No one in the coalition community with a shred of honesty or intelligence ever be imply such a thing. Its better but falls way short IMHO.",1411862400,2,1016,4.982352941176471
6516159,4,B00LYHXI84,"Brandon Beckett (Chad Michael Collins) is a sniper in Syria. He has his doubts about his occupation and desires a transfer to the dismay of his female partner Sanaa (Mercedes Mason). Meanwhile Simpson (Doug Allen) a former sniper from Afghanistan is killing off his former officers because of a botched Afghanistan mission where he got hit by friendly fire. One of the victims is Thomas Beckett (Tom Berenger) Brandon's father...a game changer.

The films shows a lot of sniper shooting. Much of it is sniper vs. sniper, which even eventually has to come down to some hand to hand. The plot is fairly simple and the only real unanswered question is Simpson working alone or was he hired by the man who has them in ""good hands"" Dennis Haysbert as ""The Colonel.""

The acting for this war film is minimal. Some of the soundtrack seems to have been lifted from the Bourne series as Chad Michael Collins becomes Matt Damon light. What I liked about the film was the dialogue. The shooting terminology jargon seemed real to my untrained ear. I don't know if this is how sniper's really talk, but I was convinced it was. The second was the unreal dialogue, i.e. the memorable one-liners they tossed about. For example:

""Drinking from the devil's cup.""

""It's black on black.""

""I'm not here"" spoken by the Allstate man.

""The bullet either wants you or it don't.""

""For those of you who skipped class, that's sniping in the grass.""

""I would rather take my long gun than your short arms.""

""They break me. They put me back together.""

""Allah himself doesn't know we're here.""

""You tough it out.""

""No limits.""

""One shot. One kill.""

For those who like cliche filled tough guy films with simple linear plots and without Seagal, this is it.

6516209,5,B00LYHXI84,"Sniper Legacy is an excellent addition to the Sniper series with beautiful locales, and super tense Sniper v. Sniper action.  It has a high budget feel to it and The story is very good.  The addition of Dennis Haysbert and Dominic Mafham (who is so good, I hope they find a permanent spot for him in this series) are spot on.  This particular entry into the series ups the tension factor with a lot of pure sniper on sniper battles (extremely tense), which is what I think makes this film such a great part of this series.  Overall, the film merits 4 and 1/2 stars, but I really feel some of the negative reviews are unfair, and I enjoyed it on a 5 star scale.  Chad MIchael Collins is starting to come into his own, and does a very good job here as Brendan beckett, as does his co-hort, the wonderful Mercedes Masohn).

Please give this movie a chance, as it is part one of the all time great and underrated franchises, and it does not disappoint.  Just FYI, in my mind the original is still the standard bearer, but the most exciting entry was Sniper Reloaded which introduced Brandon Beckett.  Legacy has a bit less action, but is super tense especially if you are a sniper purist who wants to see the out and out sniper battles, so I rank it as a tie or just marginally below Reloaded. I would love to see the Sniper series get some real big budget treatment with these actors and get released to theatres.  I just feel there is a market for great films like these to get back into the theatres.  See Sniper Legacy.",1474416000,,1519,4.3356890459363955

It has got to be hands down the stupidest story I have ever been privy to.  I actually turned it off twice before it was finished. The last time I decided to just not watch anymore of it. This was dumb. You would think after this man movies on one subject and character that perhaps a little more effort would be made to at least get the technical and tactical stuff right.

This b-movie franchise is of course formulaic, but if you enjoy these kinds of action films, and have a couple of hours to kill (pardon the pun), you may enjoy this one. It is certainly not terrible - it is what it is, and if you go in expecting a b-movie action film, this one is worth a rental. None have been as good as the original, but they can be a fun action flick for a lazy weekend kickback with your buddies.",1419897600,3,478,4.095744680851064

6516559,4,B00LYHXI84,"An engaging, well-paced & suspenseful war movie.
Well above a B-movie as far as the action and special effects are concerned.
It is clear no cost was spared in delivering the visceral, gritty body count of
the several confrontations with the baddies.
Bullets on & off target were shown with their resulting damage on the human
bodies and surroundings respectively; kudos to the film-makers for respecting us,
the audience by not stinging on these effects.
This was unlike the other war movie 'Operation Rogue' where machine gun bullets
at times do not have any effect on their human targets nor the immediate surroundings;
totally incredible and laughable.

Anyone knows when the Bluray edition for this 'Sniper Legacy' movie will be released?

A totally creditable sequel to the Sniper series. Hoorah!!!!!
Quick, bring on the next 'SNIPER' instalment ......",1413417600,5,858,5.2101449275362315

Of the 5 movies incl. the original Sniper, then Sniper 2, Sniper 3, Sniper Reloaded, and this one, only Sniper 3 I didn't care for - the plot was way too ""cheesy & campy"" for me to get into it - but the rest of them were actually pretty good, assuming you like that sort of genre'.

6516564,2,B00LYHXI84,"Cartoonish--probably fun for teenage boys, but too improbable for adults

For a movie that presents itself as a realistic military story and sniper depiction, it's just too improbable, and even ridiculous, to enjoy.

One of the absurdities was the female combat soldier--such feats by women are feminist fantasies, propagated by Hollywood fiction and by Affirmative Action (i.e., by lowering standards for women).  At least they didn't have her pretend to carry full (heavy) packs--though her male counterparts did carry full packs.  And, they pitted her against another female solider in hand-to-hand combat, instead of pretending she could fight male counterparts.

The scenery is pretty cool, especially the Greek Island.",1413158400,4,724,5.605504587155964
