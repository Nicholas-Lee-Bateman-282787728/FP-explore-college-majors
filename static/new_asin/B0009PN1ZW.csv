8064931,2,B0009PN1ZW,"It's time to grow up and think about something new! The 80's are gone. Just like our big hair. Life is good almost 20 years later. It was fun,what I remember of it and today...?No regrets! Just some sweet memories. Have a nice day!

Matt Fallon. Now of British Columbia",1148083200,,269,4.38
8064932,5,B0009PN1ZW,"Yeah, Matt was a great guy, but Baz put the Skids on the map. Unfortunately, he's a god in his own mind and pretty much destroyed the band from the inside all by himself. Shades of Van Halen...... As a fan, I agree that he is the voice of Skid Row, but having known the guys personally for over 20 years, I would never wish the pain they went through trying to deal with Baz on anyone. Better to limp along and enjoy life that do deal with that Bazzhole...............

Yeah guys, it's Tim and I'm tellin' it like it is.........",1148083200,3,528,4.227722772277228
8064933,5,B0009PN1ZW,"you are the one and only Matt Fallon fan. Let it go. No one has any interest in hearing anything by him. If they did, then he would have been the voice of Skid Row. Baz was, is, and always will be the voice of Skid Row. That is why he has a record contract and they don't even have a label.",1142467200,7,290,3.693548387096774
8064934,1,B0009PN1ZW,What were they thinking when they fired Matt Fallon(the original singer of Skid Row) Bach is over-rated and now won't even get back together with the original band and tour again. What a Loser!,1138320000,,193,4.705882352941177
