7871034,5,6304448406,"I have loved Yoga Journal Practice Series Starring Patricia Walden for years.  It's  so popular, why don't you make it available on DVD?  Even I would appreciate that and buy it if you made it available on DVD.

7871035,5,6304448406,"This is a great way to learn yoga. You can benefit from it as a brand new beginner, starting slowly, and then improving as you continue to practice. You simply do what you can do, not struggling to meet someone else's idea of perfection. I love Rodney Yee's low-key approach. My husband once walked in as I was practicing and said, ""You are doing exactly what he's doing!"" That was the best compliment anyone could give me about my yoga practice. I'm at, and probably will remain at, the Intermediate level. That's where I am. As I get older and have had injuries from an automobile accident, I find that my form isn't 'perfect' but I do what I can do and I'm comfortable with that. Rodney Yee doesn't seem to push me to do what is not appropriate for me. I like that.

I recommend this yoga practice highly!",1266192000,,808,4.386666666666667

7871037,5,6304448406,"Rodney Yee rules as an instructor. The poses are not dangerous, and there is plenty of instruction. This stuff(Yoga) really works. It's a great way to warm up to a brand new day.",1256860800,,178,4.424242424242424
7871038,5,6304448406,"This series is absolutely amazing! Challenging to say the least! Last summer I accepted a job in the Republic of Benin (where I currently reside), afraid I wouldn't be able to find a yoga class upon my arrival, I puchased the series as a ""back-up"" plan. Unfortunately, though there is a lot of interest in yoga here, there are no teachers. Hence, this series has no only increased my interest, practice  and love of yoga, but has also exposed yoga to good number of my Beninese friends. Now, I only wish Yoga Journal would translate the tapes into French, as I still have difficulty translating the advice and guidance Patricia Walden gives while in upward bow!",970876800,16,661,4.698275862068965
7871039,5,6304448406,"I live in an area where live yoga instruction is hard to find.  I attend class once weekly and do the videos during the week at home.  Each video has at least two work-outs, so you will have lots of variety if you rotate  the tapes into your routine...I'm trying to say that you won't be bored as  you would if watching an exercise tape at home day after day.
The  instruction is clear and the poses are filmed from a couple of angles to  help with clarity.  I still recommend attending a class at least once a  week so you can have your poses checked and corrected, if necessary.
I  am getting away from aerobic type exercise and doing more yoga; I never  thought I'd stay in shape through these slow concentrated movements, but  you really do get an excellent workout and I normally feel much more  challenged during a yoga session that I would in a gym.  And I do break a  sweat.
Every pose is shown in beginners modification.  Be sure to view  the tapes once before performing otherwise you will find yourself rewinding  and pausing and interrupting a good yoga session.
Enjoy.!",956016000,68,1082,4.438775510204081
