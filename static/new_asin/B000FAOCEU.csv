2558600,5,B000FAOCEU,"One of the best live shows in my 30 odd years of seeing live shows.  The only negative to the entire film of the concert is footage of ME got left on the editing floor.  Yauch was obviously star struck by Stiller.  Since he's in the film 3 times and I'm seating in the same section and there's none of me! (The same thing also happened to me at the Buffalo 89 Dead video).  If I were to have ONE minor complaint about the video is too many editing toys.  Moments of B/W footage would have been cool.  Extended sequences get a little tiresome.

Also the opening video with David Cross is a little unnecessary.",1150243200,3,608,4.234782608695652

Don't want to give away any spoilers here so it's hard to talk about it.  Let me just say the editing alone is worth the price of this baby.

2558633,5,B000FAOCEU,"***MINOR SPOILER ALERTS FOLLOW***

I'm not sure why anyone would give this lees than 5 stars.  I've read the reveiws of those who did, and I just don't see it.

If you know anything about this DVD, it was shot by people in the stands....ummm, therefore: no, this is not professional camera operators.  THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT!!!  In fact, there is a point where one of the guys goes to the bathroom and takes the camera with him.  Since these are just regular joes, it is a little shakey, but what do you expect?

The edits are a bit quick, but that keeps it interesting (especially the cut to the guys that snuck back stage).  I think the added effects to the show make it cool, like how during ""Whatcha Want"" the colors polarities are reversed just like in the video.

I like the premise of this show, because it gives depth to the audience.  In so many live shows when they show the audience, it gives this feeling of some endless mass of people.  This DVD actually puts a face to the fans and much of the flavor comes from the folks in the stands.  It kind of gives you the feeling that you're sitting next to these people, instead of being some robotic camera hanging from a line.

Actually, this show is less about the Beatie Boys and more about the fans watching their concert.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS: the selling points of this DVD are the same things people are comlaining about.  This DVD puts you in the pits, in the dirty stands, and next to the drunks pushing and yelling.  Between the intense point of veiw of the bleechers and the safe, steral, robotic veiw from a professional cameraman....I'll take the former any day of the week.",1184198400,,1643,4.408637873754153

You have to wait a couple songs for the special effects to get started, but once they do, you're in for a ride! MMM is amazing as always, but really seems to shine at this concert, pulling out beats that make this more than music.. it's art. Songs that really stand out in this concert are.. all of them! (except the new songs, but what can you do?) must have for any beastie boys fan.",1161734400,3,567,4.117117117117117
2558638,5,B000FAOCEU,"First, let me start by saying this: if you're not already a fan of the Beastie Boys, this DVD is not going to convert you. Usually, that kind of statement is a cop-out reserved for defending a poor live performance, but in this case, it simply is what it is. If you're one of those people who either A) doesn't like hip-hop, or B) doesn't like ""doo-doo rhymes"" (elaborately constructed rhymes consisting of ridiculous non-sequiturs, Dada surrealism, and absurdist goofiness delivered for the sole purpose of putting a big, stupid grin on your face), you are never going to like the Beastie Boys...ever. And when you see the manic energy of both the crowd and the boys themselves, as well as the reciprocal love, you're simply going to wonder what all of the fuss is about. I'm not about to give you any of that ""You have to see them live"" business that die-hards will often trot out to defend lackluster albums. Seeing them live won't change anything. You either like the Beasties or you don't. Period. End of discussion.

That said, on to the DVD itself. Quite simply, this is what Beastie Boys fans have been waiting on for a long time: a full-length concert. Why it has taken so long is anybody's guess, but that may actually be a good thing - now that they have so many great songs (many of which are bona-fide hits) to chose from, the set list is a lot fuller than it might have been at an earlier point in their career. Oddly, their biggest hits are MIA; they're obviously so sick to death of ""Fight For Your Right to Party"" and ""No Sleep `Til Brooklyn"" that they're apparently refusing to play them anymore. For some people, this will be a deal-breaker; but that's too bad, because they honestly aren't missed. And the rest of the playlist is superb. Now on to the specifics:

Audio: This is a soundboard recording with a full, well-defined 5.1 mix. This is live hip-hop, so don't go in expecting chamber music, but it sounds good to me, and I consider myself an audiophile.

Video: This is where there is going to be the most controversy. In one corner you have the older generation of performance footage fans who grew up watching ""videos"" of `50's, `60's, and `70's artists playing live. At that time, there were typically three cameras: one at stage right, one at center stage, and one at stage left. The center stage camera did most of the work, and the pans were long, the cuts infrequent, and the fades slow. If you grew up in this generation, chances are you're not into the Beastie Boys, but if you're one of those rare exceptions of boomers who listen to hip-hop, chances are even greater that you're still going to hate watching this DVD. In fact, there are going to be children of the `80's who can't watch this performance. This kind of video style (literally more cuts and pans per second than most older footage has per minute) is geared for a generation that possesses, in the words of Dennis Miller, ""the attention-span of a ferret on a double-espresso."" And if you have any adverse reactions (epilepsy, etc.) to strobe lights, this DVD is out of the question. But I personally think they made the right choice. As my girlfriend and I were watching this show, we were amazed at how the DVD captured the energy of the live performance itself better than most DVDs we've seen, and I honestly don't think that could have been achieved with a more traditional style. I also like the fact that they mixed in hand-held Super-8 camcorder footage (a la Blair Witch) with professional filming equipment; again, it added to the rough, live feel of the show. Finally, some people may not like the fact that the concert cuts away to follow people getting beer, going to the restroom, etc., but it really puts you there, and the way it's edited, you don't really miss any of the show. They even follow the Beastie Boys around between the final song of the regular set and the encore. In case you've ever wondered what bands do during those minutes, at least with the Beastie Boys, now you know (mainly a lot of running).

I've seen the Beastie Boys twice, and this is as close as you can get to what it's like actually being there. Overall, if you're a fan, this DVD is not merely recommended; it is essential.",1161129600,25,4221,4.55

2558640,5,B000FAOCEU,"For years now, Beastie Boys fans have craved a new DVD. In response, ""Awesome, I Shot That"" is a grand slam. This 2004 concert shows the Beastie Boys at their best, performing a surprisingly dynamic show. The fifty hand held cameras concept works very well. As with the close-ups of Mix Master Mike, professional shots fill in the needed gaps. While most of the video may be amateur, the audio fortunately comes from the soundboard. The film's editor did excellent work in choosing which camera feeds to select and the few special effects enhance the experience. The only drawback to the video editing is that the angles jump around a bit too often. The musical scope covers everything up to ""To The 5 Boroughs."" While most of the concert features the Beastie's hip hop set-up, the live band comes out twice to play the more rockin' and jazzier tunes like 'Sabrosa' and 'Sabotage.' The Beastie Boys keep things fresh for those who've listened to the group's albums a zillion times; many songs features new arrangements with different background samples. Doug E. Fresh's beat box makes 'Time to Get Ill' shine. In terms of the performance quality, the Beastie Boys are in top form. Mike D, MCA and King Ad-Rock perform an amazing set for an appreciative home town audience. The high energy DVD is packed with quality bonus features. As a live Beastie Boys experience, ""Awesome, I Shot That"" is absolutely phenomenal!",1154044800,12,1415,4.851239669421488
2558641,5,B000FAOCEU,"I imagine you all know the story...50 cameras handed out to the crowd, footage edited, mixed in with the pro shots, some crazy effects added...and so on and so forth.

But let's not forget though that this was a brave - whilst now proven brilliant - move. The Beasties, consistently over the years an energetic, entertaining and more often than not superb live attraction, have never released a live video/dvd before now. Now, in their 40's, this is probably the last chance they have to do so, and my god it couldn't be any better.

In keeping with the band's ideals to do things differently with innovation this DVD captures so much which is great about the Beasties. The sheer style of it....the shots are all well chosen and expertly edited (over a year in time frame) and visually I think the editing really gives a feel to the energy of this gig.

And what a gig. The track listing is near perfect, offering cuts from all 6 studio albums, albeit missing out on the hardcore (which was the same throughout the latest tour). The frenetic shots swarm through the likes Sure Shot and Shake Your Rump (where Ben Stiller can be seen rhyming along to every word), then cleverly slow down in time with the mid-set instrumental break, where the boys come out in 50's wedding style tuxes and play through the mellow grooves of instrumental career highlights such as 94's Sabrosa, and to great effect.

It's not just the songs though. Effects on the likes of Body Movin', where a living graffiti style offers something new, and the black and whiteness of An Open Letter to NYC... everything all plays it's part in this film, from these effects to the aforementioned editing. During Intergalactic, the Beasties make their way into the crowd, with an almost 'I can't believe how good this is!' effect. What's more, the cameras follow MCA, Adrock, Mike D through to the back of the arena, again proof that this film gives such a complete experiance of a gig you probably weren't at.

Other highlights come in the way of Time to Get Ill, where the Beasties are joined by Doug E Fresh, or the crowd singing Paul Revere word for word and the band beaming at their efforts. All special moments from what had to be an incredible show. All these individual moments make up something which go's back to the general idea. The cool idea of the fans being so involved, and the boys putting so much trust in such spontaneous film making.

By closer Sabotage, it feels like you've witnessed an event, from the early shots of the band making their way on stage and the fans being told to keep on filming, right through to Ben Stiller proclaiming the show as one of the best he's been to in the end credits. Obviously, I'm a fan...but I imagine you are too if you're reading this, and trust me, if you like the Beastie Boys then this is essential.

The extras offer a chance to switch between some of the cameras, take detours at certain points in the concert (which is all explained in the DVD manual), listen to the mic's acapella...they're all above anyway I think. I'm not too sure about the David Cross portrayal of Hornblower, but the BBQ extra really made me laugh a few times. The exclusive Shazam! video allows you to switch audio and angles during playback (in line with the Criterion DVD). For me though, there could have been no extras and I still would have loved this concert film.

8119846,5,B000FAOCEU,"It can never be argued that the Beastie Boys ever did anything the standard way. Whether through their music, their accompanying videos or just a career spent trend-dodging and one-upping themselves, the fact that you couldn't place these three MCs in a box came to define them. To that end, it should be no surprise that when it came time to chronicle the end of their 2004 tour, they decided to take an ambitious, slightly risky but no doubt inventive approach. Rather than hire a crew of camera-men or enlist the help of a big-name director to catch what remains their sole concert video, they armed 50 ticket-holding members of a sold-out crowd with camcorders and let them loose with one simple rule: no matter what you do, keep shooting.

And just like that, ""Awesome; I ... Shot That!"" was born. In what must've been an editor's nightmare, the band's own Adam Yauch (aka MCA) shapes and molds the seemingly endless footage into something somehow cohesive and compelling. The energy exuded from the stage as the Beasties is one thing; the pit's (and nosebleed's) eye view from the crowd as they jump and shout and sing along and freak out to just about every song is darn infectious. Even sitting at home, the viewer is suddenly pulled into Madison Square Garden witnessing a group two decades into their career and still in fine form. It's hard not to soak up the joy and feel compelled to get your body movin' as the Boys plow through an expansive and eclectic set. There's even the obligatory trip to the bathroom while the group indulges in a new song. Yes, this concert film goes there. Equally amusing is an extended moment where a woman in the crowd is dancing in her own little world, while Mike D. is up on stage pulling the exact same moves. Neither one seems aware of what the other is doing. It's that sort of random and brilliant synergy between an act and their audience that makes a truly special concert film.

The set itself runs down pretty much all the hits you'd expect, though is admittedly a little light on ""Licensed to Ill"" and ""Paul's Boutique"" material. The ""new"" songs from the politically-charged ""To the 5 Buroughs"" function a little better in a live setting, with the immediacy of their live delivery working better than the proper album, which, in comparison to other Beastie Boys albums, was honestly a little flat. We are even treated to a mid-show interlude where the band comes out in tuxedos and with instruments in tow to jam some of their more mellow, mostly instrumental such as ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""Ricky's Theme."" Even setting aside the unorthodox filming, this is still a compelling and hard-driving performance full of entertainment value. For even the most casual fan, this is no-brainer, must-see stuff. Heck, even somebody who doesn't like Beastie Boys or concert films in general might be swayed by the power packed into this DVD. You officially have the right to party.",1480896000,,2932,4.747058823529412

This is the perfect style for the beasties. This is probably the only time in my life that i will say that shakey, grainy, poorly exposed 8mm video footage looks absolutely beautiful. Handing cameras to their fans is such a beastie move in every sense. No, this is perfect.",1465084800,,408,4.453333333333333

8119849,5,B000FAOCEU,I just wanted to see the Beastie Boys in concert. I didn't care about the whole Super 8 cameras given to a handful of the fans thing. Some of the footage looks low quality but that's the point. The audio is still awesome and there is an actual film camera in the mix somewhere when key points in the concert happen. The song selection is very eclectic and span the Beatie's career. It's just sad seeing MCA up on stage knowing he didn't have much longer to live :( I highly recommend this DVD,1453852800,,492,4.24468085106383

It made me misty eyed to know I could never see my beloved B-Boys again, but this will help them live on forever. I purchased this to turn on and dance for exercise and I love to get my groove on to it!",1445558400,,323,3.8358208955223883
