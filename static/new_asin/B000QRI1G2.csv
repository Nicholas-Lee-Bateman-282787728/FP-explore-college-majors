2839736,5,B000QRI1G2,"this show had was the best written and best acted of any TV show I have ever seen.  No, there wasn't any sex or violence, but it was still exciting.  It took place right when the US was entering WW II, so there was tension in the air, especially since the setting was at a radio station and the characters had to deal with news issues about the war on  daily basis.  But the tension wasn't only about the war, there was also tension about love - there were two love issues going on at the station, one involving two voice actors, and one involving Betty, the show's lead.  Betty was torn between two men, and the viewer finds themself torn between which one we want her to end up with.

The only bad thing I can say about this show is how it ended - it didn't.  Blasted AMC nixed the show even tho it had on multiple awards simply because the new President didn't like it.  What was extra bad was the prior season had ended with what seemed to be a cliffhanger.  I've had to resign myself with dreaming of how I'd like it to turn out - and I spent the next five years boycotting AMC!",1230854400,38,1083,4.119047619047619
2839737,5,B000QRI1G2,"This was one of the best shows I've ever seen on television. I absolutely loved it and also wonder why it has taken SO LONG to get it out on DVD! Just listening to the title theme makes me feel wistful and nostalgic for a time I wasn't even alive to experience. If you haven't seen the show, be prepared for a treat! I have to warn you though: it IS addictive. :)",1219622400,14,363,3.9863013698630136
2839738,5,B000QRI1G2,This was a great show and I can't believe it's taking so long to get it out on DVD.  You can get shows made in the 60's easier than you can get this brilliant homage to the Golden Age of Radio.,1217808000,10,193,3.707317073170732
2839739,5,B000QRI1G2,"I absolutely loved this series. I am constantly going online to see if it's been released. I even emailed American Movie Classics (AMC) to find out if I could purchase the series. Unfortunately they knew nothing of the series (not surprised by the way AMC has changed since then) and couldn't help me, I was so disappointed. I too hope it doesn't come out in pieces (so to speak) and I can purchase the whole series and enjoy this great, fun, well acted show. I just wish it ran longer or could have been given a well deserved good-bye ending. I can't wait for a release date. Thank you (whoever) for listening to us.",1211760000,23,617,4.421052631578948

2839743,5,B000QRI1G2,"My favorite tv show of all time, ( I have a lot of company from what I've read in the reviews ). If you love Prairie Home Companion, you will have to own this series if ""They"" ever release it to DVD.

2839745,5,B000QRI1G2,"Don't you just hate it when corporate entities are so blatantly stupid?  AMC had the foresight to bring this wonderful series into the world and now has cast it off as if it were an ugly child.  Had the show been given room to breathe it would have acquired a following that would have supported it for at least 7 or 8 seasons.  If that weren't bad enough, they won't make the series available in any shape or form.  Rupert Holmes, if your reading this, you created a gem, a diamond in the rough!  Just wish I could have done one little episode.  Would have paid for my own travel and hotel to get there.  Great show!",1407110400,5,617,4.222222222222222
2839746,5,B000QRI1G2,"I keep checking and hoping  that this wonderful series will appear on DVD.  If AMC is uninterested, would it be possible for PBS to buy the series, show it on their PBS stations, and/or then sell it  as a DVD set?",1406851200,2,213,4.146341463414634
2839747,5,B000QRI1G2,"""Remember WENN"" was a fabulous, delightful, charming series and shame on AMC for stopping it.  And more's the shame for not releasing the entire series on DVD.  After the show was taken off the air and AMC became just another channel with commercials and very non-classy, let alone classic, movies being shown much of the time, I quit watching it.  And I haven't missed it.",1373932800,8,373,4.707692307692308
2839748,5,B000QRI1G2,"It is an absolute travesty that AMC either willfully refuses, or ignorantly neglects, to release such a fantastic show on DVD. I was too young to have watched it when it originally aired, but was lucky enough to have stumbled across all the episodes on googlevideo. It seems AMC has since had them taken down for copyright infringement. Apparently, they prefer no one ever watching Remember WENN ever again over actually releases it on DVD for consumption by its' rabid fanbase.

I hate you, AMC, and will continue to hate you until you give this wonderful series a proper release, or at least make some sort of deal with Amazon, Netflix, or Hulu for streaming rights! Put it on your own site for download! DO SOMETHING WITH IT!",1373328000,7,728,4.6875
2839749,5,B000QRI1G2,"Please, someone, release a DVD of the whole ""Remember WENN"" series.  I loved that show.  I'm from Pittsburgh and it was based, I believe, on KDKA Radio in Pittsburgh, which started around 1930-ish.  It brought back old memories, the story lines and actors were great, and unfortunately it was cancelled (or not renewed, same thing) too abruptly without an end.",1360972800,11,360,4.966666666666667

Can't wait to get the DVD and see what extras they add.  One thing that always confused me, though, was why the station was called WENN.  If they were in Pittsburgh during the early days of radio, the station should have been called KENN.  Though Remember KENN doesn't really have the same punniness, does it?  Release this show already, AMC!",1355616000,2,475,4.529411764705882
2839751,5,B000QRI1G2,"This series was a true capture of what old time radio was like to record. Not to mention the great humor and constant play on double meanings. A great quality program.
Any idea of when the series might be availible ?",1353801600,3,216,4.2926829268292686
2839752,5,B000QRI1G2,I have been searching for this series on any format available for ever. it was the best and I can't wait to rewatch the entire series. When will it be available???? help,1350172800,5,169,4.3125
2839753,4,B000QRI1G2,"Remember WENN evokes a day and age that many of us never knew, but somehow we envy the spirit of the radio age and those who lived through World War II. With fast-paced humor, the cast show us how difficult maintaining a lineup of shows in a small radio station could be, while entertaining us every step of the way. Unfortunately, very few episodes of the show seem to have reached video, so we can only get glimpses of the wonderfully quirky characters of the show. Hopefully someone will one day be able to issue a dvd set of the entire series. I'll be ready to watch!!!",1346284800,12,573,4.364485981308412
2839754,5,B000QRI1G2,"I still miss this show, and for all the years it was on TV and all the years since, it has been my #1 favorite television show of all time.  I used to wait excitedly each week for it to come on, and the moment the intro started, I was taken up again in its charm, its quirky characters, and the reassuring feeling of being somehow at home.  There are TV shows I really enjoy now and look forward to each week, but none of them compares to this one.  It was simply stellar in every way, from the authentic costumes and set to the endearing characters.  The look of the show was also unique.  It was filmed differently from regular shows, using a technique that gave it a soft retro look, yet with gorgeous, saturated color.

The AMC executive that axed the show might have given some thought to what the viewers wanted before making that decision, but beyond that, I have never been able to understand why such a beloved show has never come out on DVD.  There are legions of people asking for it to be released.  Whatever other considerations there might have been for canceling the show, it is mystifying that with such a pressing demand for a DVD release, none has ever come forth.  It's a travesty, really.  Hopefully someday AMC will be headed up by a wiser person with the insight to recognize that producing DVDs of the series and possibly other memorabilia would be a goldmine.  At the very least, AMC could run the series again in reruns as a summer filler for some other show.  If none of these options are appealing, it would be great if they would then just sell the series to another network that has the sense to show it again to the waiting population that was captivated by it the first time, as well as the new fans waiting to love it.

Some television shows become a part of the American culture forever.  Remember WENN was one of those, and it would have become much more so if AMC had done a better job of promoting it.  Every person I know who ever watched it at least once became a diehard fan forever, and I am convinced that if the rest had known about it, it would still be around today.  Once in a blue moon, a show is made that strikes all the right chords in the hearts of the audience.  This was that kind of show.  It was sweet, hilarious, suspenseful, and completely addictive.  I do not watch AMC anymore, because I am so disappointed in the shabby way the fans of this show were treated.  I hope that if it airs again, there will be lots of promotion beforehand so I don't miss a moment of it, and full support by the viewing audience of whatever sponsors sponsor the reruns.  The television industry only cares about money and ratings, so our efforts to make sure they get both when they offer a show that we love is the way to make sure we get to keep watching it.",1339804800,11,2797,4.299618320610687
2839755,5,B000QRI1G2,"What is wrong with AMC?  I am still in mourning at Remember Wenn's rude departure from television, and I have wanted so badly for my Dad to be able to enjoy it before he dies.

2839759,5,B000QRI1G2,"What a brilliant and clever show, Why AMC refuses to rerun or release the show on DVD is mystifying.  It is said that when Rainbow Media took over AMC in the 90's they quickly canceled Remember WENN, changed the entire format of the network and wanted to make it all ""go away"" for some reason.  Very sad, I know the set would sell if they would cut it lose!  Great, great series.",1313452800,2,379,4.236111111111111
2839760,5,B000QRI1G2,"During it's ill-fated run on AMC, we eagerly anticipated each week's episode.  We did not accept any invites that would conflict with it.  We changed dinner time that day.  We got settled in before the show started so as not to miss even a few seconds of the show.  The characters became like family to us.  And we enjoyed what was arguably the finest television (er, radio?) show ever produced.

In a way, we behaved the way our parents/grandparents' generations did when radio was the king of home entertainment.  Families gathered around the radio set, excited to learn what would come next on their favorite cliff-hanger, drama, mystery, or variety show.  Remember WENN included all of these, as well as excellent scripts and music by Rupert Holmes and delightful performances by the actors.",1305590400,8,795,4.924812030075188
2839761,5,B000QRI1G2,"I too remember Remember Wenn - and every time I see AMC producing another series it galls me to think that the best AMC series of all was canceled over a decade ago!!
Since AMC has gone from their old format of airing good movies to airing mediocre to bad movies and producing TV series - you'd think they would be able to just put a few episodes on and see what the feedback was.  I can guarantee that this show would be as popular now as it was then - and just as popular as any of their other series - despite the fact that there is no sex or violence involved, as opposed to what their current series seem to showcase!",1301788800,4,622,4.056910569105691
2839762,5,B000QRI1G2,"Just copying an older AMC tape to DVD, and about the first 15 mins was an episode of Remember WENN.

The best original period cable show EVER done. We lost it with the old AMC. Award winning, great original score, costumes, cast, I could go on and on. I hope they release the entire series as a set. It would be pricey, but worth it. There are quite a number of episodes I haven't seen.

Sadly, thought the old AMC would be around forever, and they would rerun the shows until I could get them on tape. Just seeing Betty and Victor Comstock in the clutches again brought back fond memories! I say BRING IT ON!!!!!!!!!!",1296950400,3,618,4.318965517241379
2839763,5,B000QRI1G2,"What a gem this show was. Produced by HBO if I remember correctly. Written so deftly by the incredibly talented Rupert Holmes who has written everything from rock music, thirties dance band music, broadway shows and a few good novels. The choice of the actors was remarkable. Considering all the junk available on dvd, I can not understand why something as good as this is not available. I'd pay much for a good set of recordings of these shows. MAKE THEM AVAILABLE and let me know. Dan",1283299200,3,486,4.597701149425287
2839764,5,B000QRI1G2,"This is an excellent series that I missed completely during its original run (as I do not get the AMC channel).  I only discovered it through the efforts of the many Remember WENN fans who keep it alive in their hearts and actively on the Internet forums and fan sites.

Since then I have introduced it to many more people, and they all love it (young and old).  Not only do I want a nicely-produced DVD collectors set of these episodes for myself, I want to buy a few to give out as gifts.  And while it would be nice if such a set were to include commentary from cast and crew/outtakes/still photos from the set, etc., it would need NONE of that to be a successful seller.

Come on, people.  Make it happen.  It's a no-brainer.",1278633600,3,729,4.2773722627737225

I discovered Remember WENN one sleepless night, serendipitously the very first episode, and was delighted that it was repeated a day or so after. I was able to set a tape and gather my family.  It became an instant favorite, and I tried to tape the whole series. Unfortunately, we have lost the first tape! In part because of the western PA references, we found it to be hilarious. Such quality, such intelligence, such good acting ... the likes of which have never been reached again. Sigh. Who do we need to contact to get these?",1277337600,4,674,4.545454545454546

That's the response I received from AMC today. I followed up by suggesting a release to Hulu or some other on-demand service. I can't imagine how such a great show might be allowed to languish in these times when everything is released if it can make a buck. The special Christmas episode with Betty Buckley alone is worthy of a more dignified fate. Maybe it's an issue of royalties? All that aside, if you grew up enjoying old-time radio, drawing room comedies, or are at least a fan of Prairie Home Companion, then Remember WENN is a pitch-perfect bit of light entertainment with a delightful ensemble cast. There are plenty of tv shows that command the modern attention span with thunder and lightning, but this small, luminous show was a standout for its sparkling wit and hijinks, its cheerful embrace of smaller moments, and its ringing endorsement of humanity.
