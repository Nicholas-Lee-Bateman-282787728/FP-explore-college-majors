2288779,5,B0009FV18Q,I thought it was a wonderful bio about Joan of Arc that I've never knew before. Well done.,1187827200,,90,4.055555555555555
2288780,4,B0009FV18Q,"This is a well-done documentary that gives a good overview of the life of Saint Joan of Arc.  If you do not know much about the life of Saint Joan this is a good place to start and will teach you the highlights of her life.  Even if you already know her story, you will still probably enjoy it as I did.  I especially liked the French accents and the way they refer to her as she was called in her native tongue: Jehanne.  They also did a good job in choosing an actress that fits the historical descriptions of Saint Joan. Most importantly, unlike so many modern books and films, this one does not try to explain her life apart from God and her supernatural Voices.  There are some minor historical mistakes like what caused her capture (it was a drawbridge raised not gates closed), but overall a good docudrama that most will enjoy.",1184630400,4,835,4.361290322580645

2288782,2,B0009FV18Q,"As a St. Jeanne d'Arc devotee, I was please to see a new dvd with positive reviews; one even claiming this was the best movie on St. Joan out there.  WRONG!!!!  I rated this documentary with two stars instead of one because it does cover many actual events in her life.  Unfortunately, it does so from an entirely secular and skeptical point of view.  No credit is given to God or the Faith; only to Jeanne herself and how her personal beliefs motivated her.  Not THE Truth, but her own personal beliefs.  It is quick to point out the miraculous nature of many events in her life, but portrays them as extraordinary human events, with certainly no credit to anything divine.  Yeah right.  Like a 16 year old peasant girl in male-ruled Europe just happened to get on a horse and lead her country to victory after victory.  Nope, nothing special there!  Anyway, another disturbing aspect of the documentary is several of the ""experts"" exhibit their own biases and beliefs when they interpret Joan's own words for themselves.  For example, they claimed that Joan's visions were not actually Saints; she simply said they were later on during her trial to avoid persecution.  Poppycock!

So skip this biased film.  It isn't worth the money, and it certainly is not worthy of the Saint herself.",1179273600,36,1288,4.7174887892376685
2288783,3,B0009FV18Q,"Interesting documentary of Joan's life. It is very much like the Movie by LeeLee Sobieski. For those interested in the subject, it is a comfortable viewing and informational.",1173312000,,174,5.25
2288784,5,B0009FV18Q,"Based on the actual testimony of Jeanne d'Arc, this marvelous film is part re-enactment and part documentary, combining quality acting and cinematography, and interviews with people like Siobhan Nash-Marshall, author of ""Joan of Arc: A Spiritual Biography,"" and Kelly DeVries, author of ""Joan of Arc: A military Leader."" It also shows paintings from the era, and the resemblance of the actors to some of the artwork, especially Michal Havelka, who plays the Dauphin Charles, is remarkable. Lucie Vondrackova's portrayal of Joan is moving and believable, and Tomas Karger is excellent as Alencon. Anna Paquin does the voice over as Joan, and Alfred Molina pulls the story together with his narration.

Producer/director Pamela Mason Wagner has brought the many dimensions of this account into a cohesive one-hour docudrama, which was presented by Faith and Values Media for the Hallmark Channel, and filmed in France and the Czech Republic. If you know nothing about Joan of Arc, you will learn a lot, and if you are familiar with the life of this incredible saint, whose strength was her submission to God's will, you will appreciate how well her story has been told.

Joan was only 13 when she started to hear voices guide her, and 17 when she became a warrior for France. This illiterate teenager led an army, stood her ground against Bishop Cauchon's difficult questions for weeks, and changed history. In a closing statement, the narrator states ""Joan's story is an inspiration to anyone who believes in following your Voice, even if it consumes you.""

The DVD Special Features include a biography, timeline, and ""Important People and Events,"" but you need a PC capable of playing DVD-ROM to access them, which I do not have, so cannot comment on them.

Also highly recommended for further viewing is Carl Dreyer's silent masterpiece ""The Passion of Joan of Arc.""",1155945600,41,1867,5.071661237785016
2288785,5,B0009FV18Q,"I'm a major fan of Joan of Arc or as she was once called Jeanne d' Arc. Jeanne was a mere peasant girl who lived in War torn France; but at age 17, she rallied a demoralized nation and changed the course of history forever. There have been many excellent movies and plays about the life of Jeanne; but, in my opinion, this one is the best. It is based upon Jeanne's writing and also upon the historical records of the time. It doesn't take the liberties that many other presentations have in the past.

This presentation stars Lucie Vondrackova as Jeanne and she does a masterful job at capturing this historical heroine's quest to stop the English invaders, coronate the Dauphin, and save France from invaders; while helping the viewer to discover a fascinating, idealistic and innocent young woman. One of my favorite actors, Alfred Molina, provides the historical narration for this 56 minute presentation; while Anna Paquin gives provides Jeanne's voice.

Inspired by ""her voices"", young Jeanne struggles to achieve her own vision in a brutal and dangerous world. Many scholars offer their insights about this young woman's quest. I highly recommend this movie.",1151280000,6,1165,4.938775510204081

2288787,5,B0009FV18Q,"Joan of Arc : Child of war, soldier of God.  Molina, Alfred [narrator].  Faith & Values Media, 2005. DVD, 56 min.

This great historical perspective of Joan of Arc starts in 1425 as Joan states ""It is Gods will to deliver the people of France from the calamity that is upon them"".  The DVD is based on the testimony of Joan of Arc.  Joan recounts the amazing joy of hearing voices talk to her to keep the faith through the time of English occupation of France.

The story of Joan of Arc starts when she is 13 years old when God was guiding her towards defending her country and continues on when she, at 17, convinced the King of France to grant her an army.  Joan just seemed to have an aura around her that made people believe in her.

During the story, some historical experts and psychologists talk about Joan's mystical [divine?] powers.  Joan is a pillar of strength for those of us who doubt God's purpose for us in this lifetime. It is funny to think that Joan was tried for being a witch and it wasn't until after her execution that people rose up and made her the most significant female figure in her time.",1140998400,8,1117,4.331730769230769
2288788,5,B0009FV18Q,"This documentary film with reenactments in parts succinctly tells the fascinating story of the great military leader Jeanne d'Arc who never killed anybody, the Catholic Sainte who was first burned for heresy and then canonized by the Church.
Well done.",1366588800,,252,5.325
2288789,5,B0009FV18Q,"No Ted, Joan of Arc was not Noah's wife. She was a peasant girl who demonstrated great skill in leading small French armies to big victories against the English in the Hundred Years War. Captured and sent to the English commanders in exchange for money, she was put on trial for heresy, found guilty, and on May 30, 1431, executed. Later, a high court examined the trial and declared her innocent.
Good bio-pic.",1360627200,,411,4.6438356164383565
2288790,3,B0009FV18Q,"I wasn't so happy with the acting. Of course this movie won't have professional acting and movie qualities you would expectect from an actual movie itself, since this is a documentary with re-enacting historical events. But, if you're looking to learn history based on Joan of Arc's life experiences, then I guess it would be a descent item to purchase.",1342742400,,353,4.9
2288791,5,B0009FV18Q,"Concise and well produced. Have viewed some others and they failed with poor acting or to much unnecessary drama. Leans more toward a documentary however, it is entertaining. The life span of Joan while she was involved with her mission was also short lived. In retrospect, the movie/documentary leaves you wanting for her to have lived longer. However,she did accomplish her mission.
Good vid.",1328313600,2,394,5.171875
2288792,4,B0009FV18Q,"This film version of the real-life events that happened in 15th century France is historical and dramatically enacted.
Students of European history will find it very useful to their studies and the film is also entertaining.
It is also reverent to Joan and her claim to have been inspired by God and his saints to save France from foreign invasion.",1316304000,3,348,4.816666666666666
2288793,5,B0009FV18Q,"Joan of Arc is a fascinating historical character.  Female soldiers were not the norm in medieval Europe but they were not unheard of.  There were numerous women martyrs.  Joan's story though is an incredible one of a teenage girl who believed God called her to drive the English out of France.  Whether or not one feels she was a on divine mission, her journey undoubtably changed history.  The inspiration and tragedy also ensured her story would be told and retold.

""Joan of Arc-Child of War, Soldier of God"" is an excellent presentation of Joan's life.  The documentary combines reenactments, solid narration by Alfred Molina, and scholarly commentary.  The cinematograhy and music is very appropriate.  The presentation is highly respectful to Joan without pushing any side too strongly.  Overall a highly interesting and informative documentary which I recommend.",1312675200,,870,5.2846715328467155
2288794,5,B0009FV18Q,When I watched this on TV I loved it!  I decided to get it!  It arrived here in a great and brand new condition!  Thank you!,1289606400,,124,3.6923076923076925
2288795,5,B0009FV18Q,"When I was asked to be a part of this film I was a bit worried as the film company was named Faith in Media. But then I was able to view their superb St Francis and St Patrick films and decided to be interviewed for this film. What a great experience! The filmmakers were sensitive to the historical events but also believed in Joan's mission. They did not dwell on why Joan would pursue her mission, only that she believed she had one. There was no girl trying to appeal to a father who only wanted boys or psychosis or made-up rape of a made-up sister. What a relief! But they also did not fall into the error of some of the reviewers of the film here and try to create an ahistorical Joan to satisfy their unhistorical religious beliefs. Joan of Arc was a historical phenomenon, and if one makes her more than that she becomes a myth. A real Joan lived; she inspired soldiers and leaders to do great things; she changed the course of the Hundred Years War and the course of history. Could someone else do it; probably, given the right situation and right person. In a way her contemporary St John of Capistrano was doing the same in the Balkans, and Pierre d'Aubusson would do the same in 1480. That Joan was burned for her beliefs also made her a special historical figure -- and that the Catholic Church which burnt her later made her a saint would make her a unique historical figure. Thanks Faith in Media for giving me the opportunity to be in this wonderful film.",1255046400,7,1472,4.356363636363636
2288796,5,B0009FV18Q,"This film is by far the most accurate documentary of all times.  I am pleased to see that watching this film of Joan of Arc displayed true piety than the movie ""The Messenger:  The Story of Joan of Arc,"" where Joan of Arc is displayed as a crazy maniac.

""Joan of Arc - Child of War, Soldier of God"" for a lousy $1.14 from Moviemars for this lovely film, it is worth the buy!",1254441600,4,375,4.04054054054054
2288797,2,B0009FV18Q,"Unfortunately having read much on Joan's life, this movie does not bring out the wonder of the accomplishments that Joan was able to perform with the help of God on the battlefield to the great amazement of her generals.  There were things she new and predicted that could not have been anything but divinely inspired.  This movie misses all that and is far too brief, frequently missing the best points of key events and staying too long in the mundane.  I wish I could recommend another movie in its place, but they all fall far short of the books I have read about her.  Pick up Mark Twain's Joan Of Arc book to start with and you will get a much better appreciation for the miracles and fiesty personality of this great saint.  Twain's book can be appreciated by all ages as with most of his books.  Twain claimed it was one of his best books and he spent years in research for it.  Look also to anything by Rgine Pernoud for excellent historical information on Joan and proves Twain did his research very well.  Don't use this movie to find out about Joan.  It does not place her in the best of light and was a disappointment to me.",1213747200,23,1137,4.376190476190477
8060051,1,B0009FV18Q,"Having read the 5-Star Amazon review that stated ""this marvelous film is part re-enactment and part documentary"", I purchased this DVD with that expectation:  marvelous, re-enactment, documentary.

As either re-enactment or documentary, this film is worthless:  it is riddled with errors.  The script and the ""re-enactments"" are thoroughly unreliable.  With the exception of Dr. Kelly Devries, the ""experts"" were surprisingly inaccurate and ill informed.  With the wealth of primary source (written by contemporaries) documents that exist concerning the historical Joan of Arc, this level of ignorance is simply inexcusable.

For those interested in the historical Joan of Arc, I recommend the thoroughly documented (20 - 50+ pages of endnotes)

8060052,5,B0009FV18Q,"I agree with Donald Spoto (""Joan: the Mysterious Life of the Heretic Who Became a Saint""), this is a really first-rate film production of the life of Joan of Arc. The scenes are short but well-done, with some beautiful natural landscapes providing added authenticity.

8060056,3,B0009FV18Q,"I would have given this a higher review if I were simply rating its production value and the talent involved. Unfortunately, the work suffers the fate of so many drama-mentaries whose subject matter is Jeanne la Pucelle: becoming so caught up in the image she has been given that it ignores certain facts. Though noone can claim to know exactly how it felt for Joan of Arc, she is nevertheless one of the most well-documented people in history. Thus minor things which are played for drama or symbolism, such as Joan tossing her dress in the fire (in reality she gave it as a gift to one of her fellow knights as she had little else to offer), somewhat mar the overall historical value of the piece. However, this is only in the eyes of a Joan of Arc scholar, and otherwise this film is well done.",1426723200,,797,4.428571428571429
