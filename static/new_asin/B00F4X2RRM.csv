8612326,5,B00F4X2RRM,"If you've watched it this far, it's obvious you love it and adore it as I do so I won't go on and on about how much I love the mystery and characters and well STORY in evangelion .....ok ok I'll just give my review for this volume.  (clears throat) (cracks knuckles)  This is a cliff hanger.  I'll try not to give spoilers but it will leave you gripping on your seat and throwing your $30 dollars you pay for subbed EVA tapes around the room happily, because you would give anything to switch that money with the next volume.  Secrets are revealed, more characters devolpment and great action.  The music in this series just is so great, you'll want to go and buy a cd or download midis and mp3s like I do ;) This tape contains imagery, extreme graphic violence, and suggestions toward sexual situations which is just great!  Haha, you can tell I love this tape, ne?  It's a whoel step up in Evangelion and you know the stairs don't end there.",995241600,,943,4.354285714285714
8612327,3,B00F4X2RRM,"While Evangelion is incredible, this tape takes a disturbing turn. For some reason, this tape crosses the line between subtle humorous references to sex to an actual sex scene albeit in silhouette. I was disgusted by it, but the scene only lasts a second or two.
The next tape is incredible, and, to understand it, this episode must be watched, but I am extremely disapointed by the creators for choosing to place such a blotch in an otherwise great anime.",989020800,,456,4.7125
