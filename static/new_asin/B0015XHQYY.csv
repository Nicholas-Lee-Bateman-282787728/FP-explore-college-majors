First off, most conventional music fans and traditional opera-lovers will not enjoy this avant opera.  It is dark and grotesque, utilizing Freudian imagery in the service of an obtusely feminist rendition of the well-known story.  I am not a conventional music fan nor a traditional opera-lover.  I am an afficionado of the avant-garde, and I have enjoyed previous works by the composer, Unsuk Chin, who was born in South Korea but now lives in Berlin (see for instance&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-set-of-chamber-music-in-the-DG-label-s-now-defunct-20-21-series/dp/B0006VXF2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this set of chamber music in the DG label's now defunct 20/21 series</a>&nbsp;which I reviewed upon its 2005 release).  But I find this opera to be dispiriting -- it does not move me musically or dramatically.  The staging and costumes are fairly impressive in some sequences, not so much in others.

I am quite disappointed that Chin's promise was not fulfilled here.  I am at a loss as to how this ALICE received so much praise in Germany, where it was acclaimed as the premiere-of-the-year by a leading opera magazine after its debut at the 2007 Munich Opera Festival.  Germany supports more music theater, and more avant music theater, than elsewhere, and novelty is more rewarded there, that is my only explanation.

3148276,5,B0015XHQYY,"It is quite challenging to take a complex book such as Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' as basis for a new opera. After all, it has nothing to do with the traditional operatic subjects. Just take Carroll's wordplays as an example: how can one render these into operatic action? However, compsoer Unsuk Chin and playwright David Henry Hwang, have succeeded. Hwang is a linguistic virtuoso, and he seems to thrive in transforming 'Alice' into singable texts. The music is rich, beautiful and many-sided, listener-friendly and challenging at the same time. Chin fuses her original musical style, which sounds sometimes non-Western in its extensive use of percussions and its intricate rhythms, with allusions to different musical epochs, which are often displayed in a whimsical way. Many contemporary operas lack a sense of drama, but not this one: it's simply great musical theatre in the spirit of Lewis Carroll.
The musical performance is top-notch. Kent Nagano, an ingenious conductor especially for 20th century and contemporary music, shines with Chin's music and the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra and Choir are fabulous. The singers succeed in masterful performances although the music is very complex.
As regards the staging: one can see that the German stage director Achim Freyer, who was also in charge of design and light, was an acclaimed stage designer before he began directing. The visual aspect is absolutely stunning: Freyer has created unique images which not many (if any) opera directors can match. The Art brut-like masks and puppets, at the same time touching and eerie, are made by Nina Weitzner.
As regards Freyer's interpretation of 'Alice's' content: the director seems to be inspired by Siegmund Freud, and thus he takes the story deadly serious. There is not much room for the playfulness so crucial for Lewis Carroll's writing. Sometimes it is difficult to follow the stage action, as Freyer decided to double all roles with actors. There are a lot of grotesque ideas, which are sometimes interesting, sometimes maddening. It's a very eccentric staging and, according to the critic Alan Rich ([...]) it differs from the libretto - thus standing in the tradition of deconstructivist Central-European 'Regietheater'.
The chaotic video directing doesn't make much sense and thus fails to do justice to the production. However, as this is the only document of a highly interesting and unusual opera, it deserves five stars.",1220659200,18,2439,5.256410256410256

8260251,3,B0015XHQYY,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 2007 production of Alice in Wonderland...
As I go through every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence I'm learning to throw up a disclaimer for any Alice story rendered as a musical, a ballet, or an opera. These are simply not my mediums, and readers should know that. I still have opinions of course, but I engage them gingerly.

If you, like me, are somewhat opera illiterate we can find little solace together in consulting the experts on this one. The reviews from those in the operatic know are quite mixed. As are ALL reviews of ANY Alice production! Ha ha. I've reviewed about 25 or so here on Amazon now, and it's surprising how diverse the reviews of any one production are. Pick an Alice production and you will find someone who absolutely hates it as well as someone who prizes it as the best Alice ever. The thing that's unique about Alice in Wonderland productions is that there are always TWO things under scrutiny; ""Did they follow the book?"", and ""Did I like this production?""  There are some great productions out there -the preponderance of them actually- that are enjoyable to watch, yet many have little to do with Lewis Carroll's books. That is what American audiences in particular have been spoon-fed, while across the ocean the British productions tend to track the actual story and dialog better. Having said that let's see what there is to see about this German production:

Is this rendering of the Alice story as an opera, which stars 32 year old Sally Matthews as Alice, worthy of a viewing? Well, if you were trapped on a desert island and could only bring a few Alice movies with you, the answer is decidedly NO. And if you have kids I would keep them away from this one as well, unless you care to explain why two large twin creatures that show up early on, supposedly reminiscent of the Tweedle brothers, have over-sized male appendages for noses, and why the Duchess's cook runs around for a while with her tits out. If you just love Alice however, and have the time and money, there are some quite redeemable aspects to this production for both opera lovers as well as the unwashed masses, although you should be very familiar with the book before viewing. There's not a lot of exposition being acted out.

For me the number one attraction was how they embodied Alice and the Wonderland characters. You've never seen anything like this. For Alice they place a large wire frame mask over the actresses head. They use giant puppets for other characters. Giant, to the point of grotesque, but it's fascinating. The action takes place on a large moveable stage with trap doors, allowing characters to easily appear and disappear. They also make extensive use of guy wires to put the characters in motion, including a creative way of elongating Alice when she grows in height.

I also liked the music. It is dark at times, but so what. The book is too. The music becomes an additional character, giving us hints as to what's going on. It is the substrate running through the performance, so if it happens not to resonate with you you're pretty much done for.

And we need those musical hints, because where the production falls down is the manner in which it was filmed. Someone was really asleep at the wheel here. An unending barrage of unneeded close-ups prevents us from seeing what's going on on the stage! And what's more the sound recording was weak, which really put the kybosh on being able to hear the performers over the music. Use the subtitles if your DVD has them because much of the dialog is straight from the book. The opera actually follows the book pretty well so it's a shame we can't hear better. Speaking of being true to the book, the production included the piece about the letter ""M"" from the Tea Party passage, which is rarely enacted.

Like any Alice production there are a number of goofy mistakes to be on the lookout for. For some reason they don't grow Alice tall for the tart trial, even though they had the means to do so and had employed it earlier. And why is the King of Hearts wearing a frozen time hat, when it would have been perfect for the Mad Hatter? And why all the pointless sexual references that raise pointless questions? I suppose the director would tell us this is art.

Yet in spite of the significant flaws for me this is an Alice worth viewing thanks to the costuming, the music, and for taking a good stab at being true to the book.

8260252,5,B0015XHQYY,"This is a fantastic production.  Achim Freyer was the perfect choice to direct this production.  His vision is colorful and bizarre and abstract--just the way Alice in Wonderland should be.  Freyer is one of the only opera directors who is really in tune with the music and story, creating memorable and mesmerizing images that are simply just beautiful.  Chin's score, although a little bland, has its moments and is modern and interesting.  It really highlights the absurdity of the book really well, something that marries perfectly with Freyer's staging.

With this all being said, I wish there were a re-release of this opera from another cinematographer.  There are so many interesting and beautiful things going on the stage, but we are only allowed to view it for a few seconds.  Often times the stage goes through a radical transformation, but we only find out about it when the camera stops spinning.  It could get a little frustrating, but despise this I'll still give it 5 stars, since what we do see is still amazing, and it is fun to watch.  This is not an Alice for children though.",1342569600,2,1097,4.787234042553192
8260253,1,B0015XHQYY,"This was a extraordinary staging of an outstanding work by Unsuk Chin, one of the most brilliant composers working today and in this case supported by a first rate playwright, David H. Hwang. Achim Freyer and Nina Weitzer created a fantastic staging and Nagano's conducting of the wonderful cast and the Bayerisches orchestra is as excellent as usual.
Regrettably Ellen Fellmann, the video director, instead of discretely and effectively translating the live experience to video for our enjoyment, decided that she was an artist of the same caliber as the important people mentioned above and opted to use their good efforts to compose and incoherent and utterly annoying visual mess that she probably also considered ""artistic"". Half of it is filmed out of focus for reasons impossible to discern. Extreme close-ups prevent the viewer to gain any sense of space or understand what is we are looking at, like for example the passages where multiple representation of Alice are on stage and it becomes impossible to determine which one are we seeing on the screen. The camera work is ridiculous, arbitrarily tilting it when the director is keeping the characters perfectly vertical, disorienting the viewer even more.
The overall effect is so upsetting that totally ruins the experience. Probably the worst transfer to video in record of a live performance of anything.
Avoid it, it's too frustrating and I would say enraging when you consider the quality of the original material.",1338681600,16,1480,5.145228215767635

But this opera, and most, but not all, of the aspects of the production, is complete garbage!

The two impressive things about this production are the vocal stamina of the Alice, and the interesting costumes and set design by Achim Freyer. But opera is about music, and there truly is no good music to listen to throughout the two hours of this performance.  The introduction to the ""Mad Tea Party"" is interesting (it's actually the reason why I purchased the DVD - I had heard that introduction as an excerpt on YouTube), but that musical snippet is only two minutes long! For the rest of the long two hours there is no melody or coherent musical structure. Another major complaint is the screaming (believe me, it's not singing) of Dame Gwyneth Jones, who was WAY past her prime when this document was made!

I am only giving this opera recording one star because of Achim Freyer's (the director) contribution. Based on the so-called ""music"" I would give it a zero. If you want to hear an interesting snippet from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" please listen to the introduction to the ""Mad Tea Party"" on youtube. But don't waste your money on this recording. It's crap!",1297296000,,1355,4.661087866108787

I loved the bizzare costumes.  But this video is simply unwatchable. I feel seasick. What a pity. I think this would have been great if the editing and camera work were not such a distraction.

I sincerely hope this show comes to my city so that I can see and enjoy the show live. Minus zooming,swaying cameras and insane editing, I believe the show will get a great review from me.",1293753600,2,539,4.469387755102041
