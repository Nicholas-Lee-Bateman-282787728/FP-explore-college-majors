I was playing the good guy.""...""I will continue wearing the white hat and black mask until I ride up into the big ranch in the sky."" (On his costume as the Lone Ranger, February 4, 1985)...Clayton very much enjoyed quoting and lived by ""A Ranger's Creed"" which included this moral lesson ""That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and light it himself.""

BIOS:
2. Roy Barcroft (aka: Howard Harold Ravenscroft)
Date of birth: 7 September 1902 - Crab Orchard, Nebraska
Date of death: 28 November 1969 - Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California

Second Special Footnote, actor Roy Barcroft one of the most sought after badmen of the Saturday Matinee era --- His face appeared in more westerns than any cowboy villain who rode the range in the '40s and '50s --- an complete account of ""Roy Barcroft:King of the Badmen"", which is the title of Bobby J. Copeland's book on the life and times of ""Republic Pictures Number One Villain"". Barcroft appeared in B-Westerns and Serials - became one of the most recognized actors, when you heard that familiar voice --- you were in for it. Roy was one of the few bad guys that once you saw his name in the credits, you were going to get your money's worth. Barcroft was my first favorite and my second was Harry Woods, who in many ways reminded me of each other --- I remember watching Barcroft in a variety of Republic Serials --- ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), as Captain Mephisto --- ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945), as the invading Martian --- ""G-Men Never Forget"" (1948), a dual role as the honest police commissioner and the lead villain (good & bad look-alikes) --- ""Don Daredevil Rides Again"" (1951) --- ""Radar Men from the Moon"" (1952), as Retik --- My favorite B-Westerns were the casting of Wild ""Bill"" Elliott and Allan ""Rocky"" Lane vs the under handed dealings of Roy Barcroft, boss, leader of the gang or henchmen --- every frame was B-Westerns at their best --- With knock-down-drag-out fight scenes that gave you everything you ever wished for and more in an action film --- fellow actors, producers and directors all agree Roy Barcroft was as beloved as anybody else in the Motion Picture business.

7823153,4,6302249821,"Clayton Moore was one of the busiest serial actors around, before his TV fame as the Lone Ranger (he and Buster Crabbe could legitimately compete for the serial hero king title). He does a good job here as an FBI agent,  but veteran villain Roy Barcroft steals the storyline in a dual role, as a  police commissioner and as the criminal who impersonates him after plastic  surgery. B-westerns have been only half-jokingly described as a series of  pictures in which different heroes beat up or shoot Barcroft; this serial  shows what a good actor he was.",959904000,6,554,4.729166666666667
7823154,4,6302249821,"This is an interesting, although not quite remarkable serial. Clayton Moore plays a government agent out to help recapture a nefarious criminal using modern scientific methods.
The head crook steals the show, having  himself altered by plastic surgery to look like his foe, the Police  Commissioner. Swearing revenge against the man who had him sent to prison,  he has himself doctored, then kidnaps the real cop. He assumes the role of  Police Commissioner to facillitate his crimes, and implicate the  Commissioner.
The famous flooding tunnel sequence was taken directly from  the classic ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"", made several years  earlier. To me, recycling the sequence made this serial seem less creative  and inspired.
In turn, the method of tracking the crooks' car to their  hideout by adding a substance to the radiator was used in a later serial,  ""Government Agents vs. the Phantom Legion"".
Probably the most  remarkable moment is the cliffhanger in Chapter 10. In the scene, a crook  goes to the hero's apartment to commit the murder of a man waiting there to  give info to the hero. The menacing crook turns on the radio, kills the  man, and then lays in wait, gun at the ready, for the hero to  arrive.
This sequence was an amazing change of pace and totally  unexpected, both in its inclusion and in its quality. It was pure film  noir, absolutely suspenseful and mesmerizing. It made up for a multitude of  sins.
Otherwise, this is a workable crime serial, starring Clayton Moore  of Lone Ranger fame.",952300800,6,1525,4.909803921568628
7823155,4,6302249821,"In this action-packed serial, Clayton Moore and Ramsay Ames doggedly refuse to let the evil Roy Barcroft stand in the government's way. If you like Moore as The Lone Ranger, you'll enjoy seeing him in a  ""civilian"" role as an athletic leading man, and the striking  Ramsay Ames gamely joins in the action. Lots of stunts, fistfights, etc.,  and an excellent editing job: spectacular footage from older serials and  features is cleverly worked in to give viewers their money's worth. Fun for  serial and action fans.",944611200,5,515,4.941860465116279
