8157882,5,B000KKVW5W,"This comical movie set in Sweden in 1984 was a delight to watch. 19 year old Abra is tired of the village she lives in and soon leaves for Gothenburg, where she successfully manages to move in with a rock group. The movie follows Abra's exploits around Gothenburg and her fibs that she has to tell to make the band believe she is older and wiser than she really is.

The movie is very authentic for its props, fashion, music of 1984. There are several decent tunes from the early 1980s included in the movie too. Produced back in 2005, the film has never had a release in the USA, but is well worth seeing, particularly for showing an earlier role for Joel Kinnaman. Kinnaman has recently been seen in the AMC screened US remake of the Danish series The Killing playing Detective Holder.

This feel good movie is well worth a watch, and although the ending may have been obvious from a very early stage, it was a joy to see.",1317340800,,924,4.366279069767442
8157883,5,B000KKVW5W,"Saw this at the Mpls Intl Film Fstvl last year (?) and was pretty blown away by it.  Talk about a fun movie about cute Swedish girls starting a punk band.  Yet, it's more than that.  The Swedish setting and the interactions between these actors are phenomenal.

It KILLS me that it isn't available in the US format.",1178841600,,315,4.379310344827586
