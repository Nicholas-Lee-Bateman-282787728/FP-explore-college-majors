8356880,2,B0028S111O,"Yo Amo a Juan Querendn (I Love Irresistible Juan - 700 Minutes)

All the main characters are played by new faces, with the exception of the villain Csar Luis, played by Alexis Ayala, who does a bang-up job as both a dastardly businessman and his twin.

Our eponymous Juan, played by Eduardo Santamarina, is our ""hero,"" although he is such a blow-hard egoist it was hard for me to root for him (he DOES have a great big beautiful body, though). On the other hand, the bone of those two guys' contention, Paula, played by Mayrin Villanueva, is a new face and a charming actress. The villain has three women in his stable: his wife, his mistress, and his next conquest. Even as he is vowing undying love for the conquest, whom he marries eventually, he has others on call.

Juan is head over heels for Paula but is constantly ogling pretty women on the street and in the office. He starts out as the driver for the woman he adores, but ends up owning the company. It's clear that the writers and performers have never worked in a business environmentL jobs and promotions are handed out with blithe disregard for reality.

Oh well, even though the English captions are excellent, this wasn't good enough to get invested in the plot. Not recommended.... I bought my copy through Amazon.",1396569600,,1282,4.585152838427947

8356883,5,B0028S111O,"I love this Spanish drama show. I was planning to get this dvd soon. I wasn't planning to write a review on this show until I seen someone putting a bad review on this show. I must say this show is funny, dramatic, romantic, and bring back great memories. I will recommend this show to anyone. A word of advise its only in Spanish audio, but their's English subtle.",1326153600,,365,4.304347826086956
8356884,1,B0028S111O,"I borrowed this movie from Denver library and it turned out that this movie was a waste of time. I could not understand a bit what the point of this movie is. All I could get is that the main actor loved women very much. I like movies that deliver messages for its viewers, and this one is definitely a no no.",1325808000,,309,4.0
