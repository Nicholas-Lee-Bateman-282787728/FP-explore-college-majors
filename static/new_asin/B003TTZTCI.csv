8405452,5,B003TTZTCI,"Fun hoary pre-code supernatural undertoned melodrama with nice work by Mischa Auer and Mae Busch in particular.  Not a bad print-- not a great one, either, but I've seen worse of this title.  A good choice for those who like to find oddball pre-code tales.

Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to multi-film budget brands. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for antique movies unavailable anywhere else.

SYNOPSIS--
Reporter Jimmy Reeves is sent undercover in an attempt to expose a group of con artists whose leader, a  be-turbaned hypnotist named Swami Yomurda, tugs at his victims' heartstrings with a variety of tricks, thus loosening their pursestrings. Yormuda's upfront accomplice is a mesmerized woman identified as Princess Karami. While she communes with the great beyond, films are projected on a black screen or actors located in the basement play out scenarios that also appear on this ""magic window.""

Once visitors see their loved ones (that is, the actors) are in trouble, they're desperate to help them and ripe to be scammed. One of these targets is banker John Walton. His daughter Claire is hypnotized as preparation for conning her father out of a small fortune.

Jimmy hires on as a player in Yormuda's troupe. The Swami soon learns he's a double-crosser and holds him prisoner. Jimmy's only ally is Mame, an actress with a drinking problem who's willing to help him. She gets word to his boss that Jimmy's in danger but later pays dearly for this kind deed, and now that the police have been alerted, Claire and Jimmy may meet a fate similar to Mame's.
