8324528,4,6302798493,"I recently saw this movie on TV and was pleasantly surprised. Jeff Fahey and a stellar cast deliver strong performances and make this thriller work. If you like action,suspense,romance and unexpected endings then this is a movie you will enjoy. A clever plot coupled with an outstanding music score will treat you to an hour and a half of viewing and listening pleasure. A good solid 4 stars. Unfortunately, it is not yet out on DVD but well worth watching. Enjoy!",1169596800,4,464,4.7407407407407405
