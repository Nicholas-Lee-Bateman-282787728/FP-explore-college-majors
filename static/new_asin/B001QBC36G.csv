8335336,1,B001QBC36G,"DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO!!! This video is a complete waste of money and a huge disapointment. They give the buyer the impression that this is a ""collection"" of rare interveiws from Guns N' Roses but it isn't. It is just one interveiw that lasts approximately 15-20 minutes and then stops suddenly. This same interview along with several others can be seen on the Appetite for Destruction:the interviews dvd for a lot less money! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO!!!!",1245888000,6,469,4.802469135802469

8335338,1,B001QBC36G,The whole DVD is basically a 18-minutes long footage of a signing session; completely non-edited and non-informative. The picture quality is like of an 80-ies cheap home video camera.,1239321600,3,183,5.344827586206897
