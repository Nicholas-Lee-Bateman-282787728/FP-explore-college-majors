I've spent a lot of time on video streaming sites and other various sites trying to find as much of their stuff that was subbed in English as I could. I was so happy when I found this DVD as I had found some clips on some video streaming sites.

This DVD includes the making of the video for Run, some behind the scenes clips of their 9th album, and a ton of clips of the Shinhwa members. It also includes some of their variety show appearances, which are hilarious as always. There are some things missing of course but the 6 dvds are great for new fans trying to learn more about Shinhwa and for old fans who want to re-live some of these moments.

The subbing isn't bad. It's not as quality as I've seen on some fan subbing sites, but there aren't too many mistakes. My only problem with the subbing is that at times it jumps to the top of the frame, so it takes a few seconds to find it. Also, there are times when it is a little too fast, especially when there is dialog and captions to read.

All in all, this video is a must for any Shinhwa Changjo!",1357603200,3,1165,4.100877192982456

Having said that, it's not a totally perfect package; the English subtitles leave much to be desired, important events, like Shinhwa's Guerilla Concert sans Andy, have been left out and this particular copy does not include the photobook or poster the now out-of-print original Korean release did. Still, if you're hoping for lots of ""baby"" Shinhwa (when they were rookies, eager to attempt aerial stunts and rocking gravity-defying hairstyles) then this DVD set has got you covered :)",1352246400,2,638,4.756756756756757
