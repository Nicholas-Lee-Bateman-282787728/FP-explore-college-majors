With MARY, they released Seasons 1-4, THEN released the ENTIRE SERIES.  And not the remaining seasons individually.  This means we die-hard fans will have to buy the first 4 seasons AGAIN just to own the rest of the series!  Although I LOVE RHODA, I hate being taken advantage of by these distributors.

3727323,5,B001O4KBN2,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"" is correct. This is indeed a great show.
However, his warning is not relevant. Rhoda is released by Shout Factory and The Mary Tyler Moore Show is released by Fox.
Therefore, there is no real reason to fear that following the release of the first season, only a complete series will be released.",1234396800,14,323,4.684210526315789
3727324,3,B001O4KBN2,"Update - I started to watch this season and was disappointed that over half the episodes only run 22 minutes instead the original 25 minutes.  3 minutes lost!!

Also, the quality of the prints are only so so (Colors are washed out and there are scratches on some prints.)  They warn you on the DVD but not on the box or anywhere else.

==== Now back to the reveiw of the season!

Rhoda is one of the great spinoffs of all time.  Valerie Harper, Julie Kavner and the late great Nancy Walker created the first great woman show.  While everyone was began by watching Rhoda & Joe, it was Rhoda, Brenda & Ida that kept you coming back.

This has the greatest hour in comedy TV history - Rhoda's Wedding.  This is the one time the cast of Mary Tyler Moore guested on Rhoda.

Let's hope Shout Factory does a better job of releasing Rhoda than Fox did of its parent show, Mary Tyler Moore.

The following is a list of the 25 episodes:

Joe - While visiting her family in NYC Rhoda meets a hunky demolition company owner Joe.

You Can Go Home Again - When Rhoda cannot find an affordable apartment she ends up moving into the last place she would think of staying - her parent's house. (Les Stern makes his first appearance as cousin Lenny and look for a pre-Fonzie Henry Winkler)

I'll Be Loving You, Sometimes - Joe pops the big question but not the one Rhoda wants.  ""Maybe we should see other people""

Parent's Day - It's time to meet the parents. (Robert Alda guests as Joe's Dad)

The Lady in Red - Rhoda lands a job at a publishing firm but one of her first assignments is to give the eulogy for an author of x rated books.  (Louise Latham guests as Rhoda's boss and series director Robert Moore also makes a guest appearance.)

Pop Goes the Question - Once again Joe pops the wrong question.  ""Let's move in together"" (MTM makes a cameo)

The Shower - Brenda throws a bridal shower and invites Rhoda's high school classmates (some of which Rhoda would rather not see.) (Linda Lavin, Beverly Saunders and Barbara Sharma guests)

Rhoda's Wedding - As stated above, this is the funniest hour and hopefully on the DVD they will keep it as originally shown, one episode and not two. This is so funny that parts of this episode become part of the title credits. And of course the whole cast of MTM makes a guest appearance including Cloris as the scene stealing Phyliss.

The Honeymoon - Ida and Martin spring for a cruise as their wedding present.  The only problem is Rhoda and Joe are about 40 years too young and their room has bunk beds!!  The great character actor Charles Lane makes a guest appearance.  Richard Masur makes his first appearance as Nick Lobo.

""9-E"" is Available - When one of Joe's old girlfriends shows up with a key to the apartment, Rhoda decides it is time to get ""their"" apartment.  It seems too perfect that a great unit opens up in Brenda's building. Pamela Bellwood of future Dynasty fame is Joe's ex-girlfriend and Richard Romulas is the current tenant.

I'm a Little Late Folks - The title says it all.  Rhoda thinks she might be preggers.  Beverly Saunders makes another appearance.

Anything Wrong? - Joe has fears of telling Rhoda what is bothering him. (Roberta Alda makes another appearance as Joe's dad)

'S Wonderful - Brenda has a new beau but he has a secret!

Good-Bye Charlie - Rhoda hates Joe's best friend but decides to get to know him better.  (Richard Schaal (Mr. Valerie Harper) guests)

Guess What I Got You for the Holidays - Joe's business is struggling and Rhoda offers him money to help out (Scoey Mitchell makes his first appearance as Joes' business partner)

Whattaya Think It's Here For? - Ida forces Rhoda to have Joe ask Martin for a loan but Martin can't do it.

Not Made for Each Other - Rhoda sets up Myrna with Joe's best friend Charlie.  (Barabra Sharma and Richard Schaal make another appearance)

Strained Interlude - Joe and Rhoda's relationship is tested when an old flame of Rhoda shows up. (Alan Garfield and Candy Azzara guest.)

Everything I Have is Yours, Almost - Rhoda opens up Joe's mail and finds a doctor bill.

Chest Pains - Rhoda and Brenda take Ida to her first doctor's appointment. (A pre Three's Company appearance by Norman Fell and John Ritter)

Windows by Rhoda - Rhoda can no longer manage her business from home and opens an office (Barbara Sharma becomes a semi-regular)

A Nice Warm Rut - Rhoda pushes Brenda to be more independant.  Brenda decides to move to San Francisco.

Ida, the Elf - Ida decides to become a ""career woman"" to make the girls feel guilty.  Myrna dates a client.

Along Came Mary - Mary comes for a visit but Joe and Rhoda were planning a quite weekend away.

3727325,5,B001O4KBN2,"Rhoda, TV's favorite, funny second banana is FINALLY returning in a complete first-season DVD boxed set!

Shout! Factory is issuing the four-disc boxed set to honor the show's 35th Anniversary. (Obviously, this is a pre-order review, so the actual discs could not be examined.)

The series, starring Valerie Harper in the title role, ironically became an iconic sitcom itself after spinning off from THE iconic sitcom of the era: The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Rhoda was a ratings success, even beating its parent show, and was also the winner of two Golden Globes and two Emmy Awards during its run.

Rhoda premiered in 1974 on CBS and ran for five years. Harper portrays her character, Rhoda Morgenstern, as larger than life - a big mouth, big hearted woman from the Bronx with self-esteem and weight issues. Her best friend was the prim and proper, responsible Mary Richards (played to absolute perfection by Ms. Moore), the two meeting because they both lived in the same apartment building in Minneapolis. The juxtaposition between the flamboyantly dressed, non-conformist Rhoda and the fashionable and traditional Mary was a consistent source of humor.

(Note: the following contains specific plot details.)

In this series, Rhoda, who has beaten her weight issues, takes her trademark head scarves and returns home to visit. Once there, she meets Joe Gerard (played by David Groh) and a romance begins. Rhoda decides to stay in New York, initially moving in with her younger sister, Brenda (played by Julie `Marge Simpson' Kavner), who is struggling with the same issues that had plagued her older sister.

Their parents, Ida and Martin Morgenstern (played by the brilliant Nancy Walker and Harold Gould) are arche-typically Jewish, having aired prior to political correct ideas. So, Ida is overbearing, overprotective, loving and desperate to make sure Rhoda finds a good husband. Martin is henpecked, dutiful, and mild-mannered.

In a move that was quite controversial for its time, Joe and Rhoda decide to live together, but do so only briefly. Whether from pressure from viewers or not, Rhoda quickly realizes she wants to be married, and they wed.

Just eight weeks into the series, on Oct. 28, 1974, Rhoda and Joe were married in a special hour-long episode. Widely publicized, the episode became one of the highest-rated TV shows during the decade. All of the main characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show were on hand for the nuptials. Ted Knight, who played the bombastic anchor man Ted Baxter, was not in attendance.

In addition to Mary Richards, look for curmudgeon Lou Grant, played by Ed Asner, writer Murray Slaughter, played by Gavin `Love Boat' MacLeod, sometime friend Phyllis Lindstrom, played by the brilliant Cloris `Dancing With the Stars' Leachman, and gentle Georgette Franklin, played by Georgia Engle.

In the closing credits of the first season, Rhoda was depicted walking across a New York street. She stops and tries to imitate Mary Tyler Moore's trademark hat toss, but instead the cap slips from Rhoda's hand.

Comic and producer Lorenzo Music, portrayed Carlton the Doorman. Carlton was often drunk, and always unseen. He spoke to Rhoda, et al via the apartment intercom. (Music was also the voice of the TV Garfield.) Becoming well-known for never being seen on Rhoda, gave Music the idea of never being photographed directly in public or on film. If filmed, there would always be something blocking his face, or he'd only be depicted in silhouette.

The opening explanied: ""Rhoda Morgenstern was born in the Bronx in December 1941. She's always felt responsible for World War II. She had a bad puberty. It lasted 17 years. She's a college graduate, she went to art school. Her entrance exam was on a book of matches. She decided to move out of the house at the age of 24. Her mother still refers to this as the time she ran away from home. Eventually, she ran to Minneapolis where it's colder, and she figured she'd keep better. Now she's back in Manhattan. New York, this is your last chance.""

This boxed set includes all 25 episodes of Season One: Joe; You Can Go Home Again; I'll Be Loving You, Sometimes; Parent's Day; The Lady in Red; Pop Goes the Question; The Shower; Rhoda's Wedding Part I; Rhoda's Wedding Part II; The Honeymoon; 9-E is Available; I'm a Little Late, Folks; Anything Wrong?; 'S Wonderful; Good-Bye Charlie; Guess What I Got You for the Holidays?; Whattaya Think it's There For?; Not Made for Each Other; Strained Interlude; Everything I Have is Yours, Almost; Chest Pains; Windows by Rhoda; A Nice Warm Rut; Ida, the Elf; and Along Comes Mary.",1233878400,39,4607,4.959792477302205

3727356,4,B001O4KBN2,"I recall the much anticipated debut of Rhoda in the fall of 1974. This was perhaps the hottest show of that season. Rhoda started out as Mary's best friend on the Mary Tyler Moore Show . From 1970 through the 1973-74 season,Rhoda was Mary's upstairs neighbor. In those three years we saw Rhoda go from a chunky ,sloppy loudmouth to an attractive, confident lady. I guess they felt it was time for her to move on,
So ,here she was ,back home in New York,sharing an apartment with her younger sister,Brenda. CBS placed the show on Monday's at 9:00. Wow, did it take off. As the season progressed,and Rhoda meets Joe,falls in love, gets married, moves in with Joe, the ratings went through the roof. The writing was fresh and funny. I remember her outfits and headwear setting new trends in style. Sister Brenda was cute and hilarious and it was easy to see why this show was so popular.
Having recalled all that I played the first disc and was saddened how time had changed the sharp edges and bright whitisism of the show. What were once clever wise cracks were now just silly things we used to say. Kind of like the way we remember mom's meatloaf; it was real good,but then again,it was just meatloaf.
I don't want to take anything away from it,clever as it was. Timeless shows will always be funny; Jack Benny, the Honemooners, All in the Family, MASH, Cheers, Seinfeld, But, some will just be timepieces of the eras they reflect. I think that's where Rhoda will live.
I have an enormous collection of sitcom's , but I have been holding off on buying Rhoda Season 1 till it dropped to a better price. With the changes coming and the choices made in the upcoming seasons, I think this may be the only season of Rhoda I will buy.",1432598400,,1728,4.4715189873417724

3727360,4,B001O4KBN2,"Rhoda was originally a regular character on The Mary Tyler Moore Show that proved popular enough for this ""spin-off"" series to be created. Rhoda moves from Minneapolis to her hometown of New York City, and meets and falls in love with Joe a self made demolition contractor.  Most TV shows wait until they run out of material before they marry off the lead characters.  Rhoda and Joe were married by episode 7 of the first seaaon. For a while it worked and writers were able to keep their relationship interesting.  Unfortunately, by season 3 the show-runners decided that single Rhoda was more interesting than married Rhoda and out the door went Joe.  So for me, this season and season two contain the best episodes. Valerie Harper as Rhoda, David Groh as Joe, Julie Kavner as Rhoda's sister Brenda and Nancy Walker and Harold Gould as their parents were all outstanding.  Add to that list one of the best ""unseen"" characters in classic TV, Carlton the Doorman whose impeccable comic timing was frequently displayed over the apartment building's intercom.  Lots of good episodes containing a mix of comedy and occasional drama.  A good example of a character that absolutely deserved a ""spin-off"" show of her own.",1418601600,,1214,4.892682926829268

Of course ratings took a huge dump really fast, and they had Rhoda and Joe divorce the next season and the third season ratings picked back up and it got good like it was the first season.

3727395,4,B001O4KBN2,"Spinoffs were common in the 70s, with CBS probably leading the way, and finding the most success.  Set in Minneapolis, the Emmy winning Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970-78) remarkably produced three quality spinoffs, Rhoda (1974-78), Phyllis (1975-77), and Lou Grant (1977-82).  Played by Valerie Harper, Rhoda Morgenstern was neighbor and best friend to Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) for four seasons, before James L. Brooks and Alan Burns (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Simpsons/dp/B00005ML6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Simpsons</a>, Taxi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/As-Good-As-It-Gets/dp/0767811100/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">As Good As It Gets</a>) created a program for her.

Rhoda returns home to New York City for a visit.  While staying with her sister Brenda (Julie Kavner), she meets Joe Gerard (David Groh), the divorced owner of a building demolition business.  They fall in love, and after a brief courtship, decide to get married.  Rhodas parents Ida (Nancy Walker) and Martin (Harold Gould) are happy for their daughter, but also concerned for her future, as she and Joe embark on an exciting new phase in their lives.

Rhoda was a success from the start, premiering with big numbers and quickly building to record setting ratings in Episode 8, when Rhoda gets married, with many of the MTM show cast in attendance, in a special hour long episode.  After a hilarious honeymoon cruise with a group of elderly passengers, the couple settles in to their new lives, moving into a unit in Brendas apartment building.

Like the Mary Tyler Moore show, the humor in Rhoda is mostly downbeat, but with a much stronger family component.  Although the Morgensterns are Jewish, and there are certain ethnic elements related to the characters, the comedic themes are mostly universal, which is evident by Rhoda finishing as the fifth most popular in the Neilsens, even though it was often up against Monday Night Football.

Valerie Harper displays great comic instincts, and proves more than capable of carrying a series.  She gets strong support from Julie Kavner, a relatively unknown actress, who would later become a star doing voice work on The Simpsons, and other animated features.  Brendas issues with self esteem and romance are continuously explored in the program.  Harold Gould (1923-2010) is very endearing playing the girls father Martin Morgenstern.  David Groh really comes into his own after Joe and Rhoda are married.  Hes not, the most dynamic guy, and is rarely the focus of the stories, but with a solid working class attitude, hes generally likeable, and rarely does anything to offend.

Nancy Walker (1922-92) was a tiny but dynamic woman with a powerful personality.  Walker was already known to millions for her commercials for Bounty paper towels, and was had been playing Mildred, on the NBC series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McMillan-and-Wife/dp/B004HHX9PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McMillan and Wife</a>&nbsp;for several years, prior to joining the cast of Rhoda.  Walker is great as the controlling mother, who knows just what buttons to push to get her way.  Another important character was Carlton the doorman, who primarily appeared just as a voice on the apartments intercom system.

Most of the characters endure lifes hardships without getting too agitated, but on occasion Rhoda is driven get tough and take action.  Joe and Rhodas relationship blossoms after their marriage, becoming the focus of the series.  The relationship is warm, but seems to lack romantic passion.  Rhodas unusual occupation as a display window dresser eventually leads to her going into business for herself, and hiring Myrna Morganstein (Barbara Sharma), her former high school classmate.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show was about the adventures of a single woman, making a new start, and braving the jungle of the workplace.  For Mary, her career was a huge part of her life.  The situation is quite different in Rhoda, where the focus is on the home, and Rhoda has the support of her family, and friends.  Its a much warmer world, and one that perhaps a greater number of viewers could relate to.

Season One contains 22 episodes on four discs.  Image quality and sharpness varies, colors occasionally appear a little flat, and some episodes have apparently been edited.  Some hardcore fans may be displeased, but as the chances of a rerelease appear to be slim, this set is probably your best option.",1362528000,,4557,5.532467532467533

The fact that the amazing Nancy Walker was a semi-regular on the show, it was destined to be its own classic. And, it is. Like Mary's show, this show was character based comedy, which is the funniest and holds up over time. The creators of many great shows were the creators of this. This season includes the hilarious and classic, ""Rhoda's wedding,"" which featured appearances by Mary Tyler Moore, Cloris Leachman, Georgia Engel, Edward Asner, and Gavin MacLeod.

The loss of Rhoda on MTM and the fact that Georgette and Sue Ann were still hardly used, the show wasn't that fun.
When I first found out that Rhoda was on DVD, I wanted to get it, but the 40 dollar price and edited episodes kept me from buying it. I saw the first three episodes on [...] and I liked them. Finally one day at Barnes and Noble, there was the first season for 40% off, and season two for 30% off. After 30 minutes of debating, I bought the sets.
This season of Rhoda was hilarious, I laughed my head off on every episode. The cast is great along with the scripts. The only things I had problems with were of course the picture quality and edits. Now, one or the other would not have bothered me, but both, come on.  Watching most of these episodes on my portable DVD player, I could clearly see tape flaws, film flaws, but mostly tape flaws. The colors and episodes are soft, and I swear sometimes there were little bug looking things going up and down the image. The sound quality also has a weird electronic hiss sounds. Both the picture and sound flaws though were much less noticeable on my SDTV.
Even with the presentation flaws, this is a great season of a great show. I recommend this set to all fans of the show, classic TV, or The Mary Tyler Moore Show.
P.S.  Maybe not everyone will have this problem, but after watching seasons one and two in quick succession, there's not a day where I don't whistle or hum the theme song.",1282089600,,1691,4.232198142414861

3727403,5,B001O4KBN2,This show is terrfic. At first when I read the reviews I wasn't sure to get it or not because of the reviews but I am so glad I didn't listen to them. This show is awesome. The whole issue of the quality of the dvds is highly overrated. It is not as bad as some people made it out to be. So don't worry and get Rhoda Season 1. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out. I watched the first season so fast. I love the show and I am only in my mid 20's. Shows you great of a show this is. The problem is I wish Season 2 would come out sooner.,1258329600,,537,3.5982905982905984

I emailed customer service and they sent me a new disc set and paid for me to return the damaged one. Excellent customer service!!!

3727432,4,B001O4KBN2,"The RHODA: SEASON ONE DVD set is fun to own because unlike the ""Mary Richards"" character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Show-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JLIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season</a>, ""Rhoda Morgenstern"" was the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. She was tough, abrasive, and had that strong east-coast accent and full of self-deprecating humor; the total antithesis of ""Mary Richards."" In fact, the opening sequence spoofs the MTMS opening with Rhoda throwing her hat in the air but it hits her chest and falls to the floor instead, unlike Mary's that goes soaring. I always got a big kick out that!

I remember watching the reruns in the morning when I was kid and stayed home from school when I was sick. Since then, ""RHODA"" has always been a favorite show of mine.

Valerie Harper (Rhoda), Julie Kavner (Brenda-the sister), and Nancy Walker (Ida-the mom) were terrific together and had great comedic timing and that's what makes the show so entertaining--even today. Mary Tyler-Moore (Mary Richards) and some of the other cast members from ""The Mary Tyler-Moore Show"" appear in cameos.

I deduct one-star because the quality isn't that great. ""Shout Factory"" did a wonderful job in cleaning the show up but there's still dust and scratches on some episodes, and the small edits on some are obvious because of continuity errors. But that's not the company's fault as they did the best they could with the surviving footage and it doesn't really take away from the enjoyment of watching the show itself.

The set comes packaged in a box with two plastic DVD sleeves that house 2-DVDs each, with 24-episodes in all, including the one-hour episode ""Rhoda's Wedding."" There's also a pamphlet with episode name, air date and description, along with guest star info.

Also included is a special feature entitled ""Remembering Rhoda"" (running time about 10:14-minutes) with James L. Brooks and Allan Burns talking about the show.

3727433,5,B001O4KBN2,"After reading quite a few of the reviews on here, before ordering, I wasn't sure what to expect once I received my order.

All I can say is that I think the picture quality is fine.  I've watched the first 2 dvd's without any problem, at all.  My tv is from 9/03, so I don't have an LCD or plasma tv.  My tv is 25"", not a flat screen or anything, just a plain old tv.

Considering this show is 35 years old, I think the picture quality is amazing, and just feel grateful to even be able to purchase this show, at all.

I think some of the critique on here was pretty harsh, but then I bought this show to relive a show I first came to love when I was 16 years old.

It stands the test of time for me.  I think any future buyers of this show will be happy with their purchase.  I sincerely hope that all 5 seasons are available for purchase.",1243468800,9,840,3.923076923076923
3727434,5,B001O4KBN2,I have waited many years to have this dvd and I was very happy with it. Some negative reviews that the dvd was less than perfect didn't deter me from buying. Sure hope that the masters for the remaining seasons are in good enough shape for them to release them and soon!,1242518400,3,270,4.211538461538462
3727435,5,B001O4KBN2,"When I saw the news that Rhoda Season One was coming out on DVD back in December 2008, it made my week.  I penciled in the release date on my calendar and anxiously waited for April.  Not long before the release date, I started seeing news about how the episodes had been edited from the originals, and people were canceling their pre-orders.  I did not cancel my order and I am glad I did not!!! I am very pleased with the Rhoda Season One DVD box set. I know that I am too young to remeber the show as it aired originally in the 1970s, but I became fond of the show, as well as all the other MTM shows, in the 1990s by watching them on Nick at Nite and later on TV Land.

I urge Shout Factory to continue releasing all of the remaining seasons of Rhoda on DVD, edited or not.  Of course, to please original fans, please do your best to improve the subsequent season releases on DVD.  BUT- I wll take Rhoda any way I can get her.  The season one set was not the color and audio quality of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but I think the shows are hilarious, even edited, and that the picture quality is good.  You can still see all the great 70s fashions and set decorations clearly.  There are a few jumps in the tape, especially on the Christmas episode, but I only saw this as a problem on about 3 of the 24 episodes.

Again - please continue to release all of the other seasons of Rhoda on DVD...SOON!!!! It is such a great escape for the working girls of today.",1242518400,10,1462,4.116197183098592
3727456,5,B001O4KBN2,"It is a wonderful show that was graciously made to DVD for avid fans! I'm glad it was even released at all because I wouldn't have the pleasure of watching it today. I believe that too much negative feedback on quality might cause Shout Factory to reconsider releasing any future seasons and ruin it for the rest of us that actually want this nearly-impossible-to-attain TV show in our homes... and the quality wasn't even that bad! I don't know what anyone expects, but I didn't think it was atrocious, as people are describing it. There were a few little lines. Big deal. There were also a few episodes where it sounded like the actors were in a hall, but it reverted to normal sound eventually. This DVD collection is a must-have. Please give us a season 2! :)",1242259200,3,763,4.536231884057971
3727457,5,B001O4KBN2,"There's been a lot of discussion going on here about the quality of these Rhoda episodes; suffice it to say that if you watched this on a rabbit-eared television in the mid-70s (like I did), they look JUST FINE.  And I give big kudos to Shout Factory for not just releasing these wonderful episodes, but the terrific packaging.

(From what I was reading here, I was almost expecting bootleg-quality; I was happily surprised to see excellent liner notes included, thoughtful & creative menus to the episodes, colorful discs.)  I'm not going to get into all the syndicated-original run arguments either, I am JUST GRATEFUL to see a young & beautiful Valerie Harper in one of the best characters ever made for TV!

SHOUT FACTORY, THANK YOU.  Please oh please release the next season of this terrific show, I promise I'll buy 2 copies!!  Thanks again.",1241654400,4,847,4.8068965517241375
3727458,2,B001O4KBN2,"I loved Rhoda on MTM.  But as I recall the series was more about her sister and her mother (who both got on my nerves) and her parents were NOT as previously reviewed here, stereotypically Jewish parents.  Jewish mothers DON'T act like Ida and very few Jewish husbands are henpecked.  Jewish parents aren't any different than non Jewish parents. In fact the Jewish  parents depicted in Dirty Dancing (one of my favorite films) were much more like real Jewish parents. In any case I didn't like the way those 2 were depicted on Rhoda or on MTM, and I always skipped those episodes on MTM because mother Ida got on my nerves and behaved like a complete idiot.  No wonder, Rhoda left NY.

In any case, the series Rhoda was unfortunately much more about her unfunny family than it was about Rhoda. Rhoda didn't grow.  All her friends were a bunch of goofballs, and her marriage fell apart because Rhoda was still so insecure that she drove her husband away.  As I recall the show, Rhoda was much more about her sister than about Rhoda.  Rhoda spent most of her time looking after her sister.  The rest of the time she was worried about whether Joe loved her or not.

Actually, I thought the writing on Rhoda was pretty bad. Valerie Harper did the best she could with lousy scripts.  The only character I remembered liking on the show was the costume designer whose personality kind of reminded me of Mr. Grant.  But he didn't last long, and that was really too bad.  Personally, I liked Phillis's revised sit-com much better than Rhoda, because I thought the scripts were better, the characters were better cast and more talented, and of course, Phillis, Cloris Leachman was great.

PS Despite what I wrote, I finally did order Rhoda and I was right.  Few of the stories were very good.  Many of the MTM characters came back as different characters on Rhoda.  One of the best characters was a gal on MTM who was a terrible waitress and who got fired because Mary said something about her to the manager. In turn, feeling guilty, she hired her as a sec at the office and she was awful.  The idiotic waitress-secretary (Feeb) was great in that story.  In Rhoda, there was a character whose voice I recognized, and I knew that voice came from Mary.  Like Mr. Grant, I thought I recognized that voice, but it took me a while to place her. Then I remembered.  She had a lousy part in Rhoda and the story line was stupid.  She played with Howard from MTM, who had a goofy part in both sit-coms.

Well I bought Rhoda one.  No joking about how really poor the qualities of the copies were.  One of the stories was just completely distorted.  The opening music was very bad, and all in all, though I was warned I thought I'd try anyway.  It was probably a stupid waste of money.  But I guess I had to see for myself. The only decent story line was the wedding, and that's because some of the MTM cast was there and crazy Phillis stole the show. But the other characters were didn't do much.  No comparison to MTM. I will not be ordering any more Rhoda shows.",1241395200,4,3045,4.434234234234234
3727459,4,B001O4KBN2,"There was always, even in the original broadcast differences in how the MTM shows looked.  I remember this being brought up in the 70 and it was stated that some were filmed while others were video taped and that the picture looked different depending on how they were made.  Now we are talking about the originals.

I have purchased the new Rhoda DVD set and I am very pleased with what I have seen so far, about half of the series.  The way people had been talking, I thought I was going to see something like how some of the old George Burns and Gracie Allen DVD's are.

I agree that I do wish all the shows had been unedited.  That is something I think all releases of all series should be forced to do so that the consumer gets something that they couldn't get for free on their local station or on a network like TV Land.

One other note, while the Wedding episode is complete, they have altered the accordian music seen in the scenes before and after the wedding.  The last scene originally had ""Lady of Spain"" playing as the background.

Aside from the shows not being perfect in all ways, I will say this set is enjoyable to watch and fun as well. It may not be what fans would have hoped for, but trust me it could have been a lot worse.  I would recommend this to fans of the show.",1241136000,3,1292,4.215447154471545

I am always amazed when I go the store and see dvd releases of tv shows that are  new shows, but you can't get all the seasons of MTM (the BEST comedy on tv, EVER)  Who decides what shows are put out? I mean come on,  the crappy shows seem to come out as soon as the current season ends! I enjoy reading all the reviews on amazon because I can tell you are all true fans of the show. My review is simply this: I loved Rhoda so much that I will take whatever they put out. I think if you reallly loved the show,  it is worth the money.  I already bought and watched all of season one,  now I am wondering how many YEARS until season 2?? I wish they would simply offer the entire series on day one.  I would buy it no matter what they charged for it. (For Rhoda & MTM only)  I was very dissapointed in the ""extras"" with Rhoda.  I too would like to have seen some interviews with the stars of the show. (I wonder if they will put Valerie out on dvd?)  The season one dvd of MTM had the best extra stuff but then the other seasons had nothing much.  Oh well.  I am so angry over the bright idea to release the entire series after we bought seasons 1-4,  but alas, I will buy it because these sitcoms of the '70's are worth it to me.  Especially RHODA. She was always my favorite on MTM and I was so happy she got her own show.  I did wish that they had just killed Joe off instead of divorcing them though. Rhoda waited too long for it to not work out,  but that is just me,  lol",1240963200,,1538,3.875

That makes no sense why are some shows pristine and others damaged?The first four seasons of the Mary Tyler Moore Show look great how can its sister shows produced later look so crummy and have their original stock not taken care of. Its a darn shame we have to accept this lousy quality transfer of a popular show however its not the first time the viewers have been disappointed by inferior quality produced dvds on the store shelves now. Sadly for now its either by this or nothing so we ended up buying it anyways. Even with its flaws this is a funny dvd and makes it seem its 1974 all over again.,1240963200,6,732,4.311594202898551
3727462,3,B001O4KBN2,I love Rhoda. The show is fantastic. But this has got to be the worst looking DVD I've ever seen. It looks like a VHS recording off of Nick at Nite transferred directly to DVD. The distributors (Fox or Shout or both) should really be ashamed for putting this classic show out in such a shoddy presentation.

3727463,4,B001O4KBN2,"the truth is, after watching the dvd set...i've come to the conclusion that this is EXACTLY the way i've always seen the show anyway! it's no better and no worse. if there hadn't been all this hubbub about it, i never would have even noticed (or i should say cared) because not once would i have otherwise stopped enjoying the set because of ""cuts"" and ""quality"". i'm giving it 4 stars because this is rhoda for god's sake! i got the same happiness watching these dvds as any other time i watched the show (and that's why i bought it). it would be wonderful to have all my favorite shows remastered digitally, but that's not going to happen any time soon. and this beats the hell out watching the show on vhs! believe a true rhoda fan...don't let this issue prevent you from enjoying this dvd set...it's not that bad.
UPDATE.....the cable channel ""american life"" has started airing reruns of rhoda and the picture quality on ALL episodes of season one so far is near-perfect! the episodes are badly edited, but obviously there does exist better prints of this show. why then did shout! put the disclaimer at the beginning of this season one set that these were the best possible surving masters? that's apparently not the truth...",1240704000,3,1230,4.646788990825688
3727464,5,B001O4KBN2,"I have now watched the first four episodes.  Based upon the reviews here I was expecting the set to be terrible.  The truth is it is not as bad as a lot of the reviews indicate.  I wish that all the episodes were uncut and looked in perfect condition, but what is here is better than not having any RHODA.  The episodes are perfectly watchable and enjoyable.  Some episodes in fact look very good.  Don't stay away from buying the set just because the video isn't perfect.  If you loved the show, you will find enjoyment in this set.  The video quality is a lot better than the Room 222 set and I was still able to enjoy that set.  I am enjoying the set and do miss the few minutes that may be missing on a lot of the episodes, but at least I can watch these episodes whenever I want.",1240531200,4,784,4.105263157894737

If fans don't support it, we will never get anymore and most likely it will never be seen again.  I really believe that Shout's very good effort is worth some edited for syndication episodes rather than not having it at all.  Please buy it.  It's really a great set and it's so much worth having this than nothing at all.",1240531200,5,409,4.2727272727272725
3727466,5,B001O4KBN2,"Those looking for laughs and some of the best writing on television need Rhoda: Season One (Shout! Factory).
From the very start of every episode, Rhoda Morgenstern gave you reason to love her when she affectionately warns ""New York, this is your last chance!""
This is a historic set, for its marks the 35th anniversary of the sitcom's debut; in 1974, Rhoda became the first The Mary Tyler Moore Show spin-off.  (Leachman's Phyllis came in 1975; Ed Asner's Lou Grant in 1977.) Rhoda began when she goes home to New York for a visit and unexpectedly meets hunky hubby-to-be Joe (David Groh) and decides to leave Minneapolis for New York City.
In the first season, Rhoda and Joe fall in love, get married and set up life together in spite of the non-stop meddling of Rhoda's overbearing mother Ida (played by that quicker picker-upper Nancy Walker); her needy depressed sister Brenda (Julia Kavner, now lending her nasal vocal talent to Marge from The Simpsons); Carlton the Doorman (heard but never seen, he was ""played"" by Lorenzo Music, one of the show' writers and producers) and Rhoda's loving but ineffectual father Martin (Harold Gould).
The ratings roof-raiser one-special special ""The Wedding"" reunites Rhoda with her old pals from Minneapolis-Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Cloris Leachman, Gavin McLeod, Ted Knight and Georgia Engel. Remember Rhoda, wedding dress, subway? We're howling as we type!
Rhoda remains fresh and funny. Time has been kind to her, perhaps of (a) the brilliant scripts, (b) the brilliant acting (c) the universal appeal of love and the healing power of laughter.
She is woman. Hear her roar.
Then roar back. With laughter.",1240444800,4,1653,5.010909090909091
3727467,2,B001O4KBN2,"This star ratting is based on this set put together and distributed by Shout Factory.
The Image of the film transfers on this set ARE just disgraceful.
Each episode contains film dirt, spec's color fades and video tape damage runs as these episodes aren't taken from film to digital, but rather analog tape to DVD. These episodes look as they were taken from some public domain source.
Now Shout Factory does note in the start of the DVD that these episodes contain glitches and this is from the best possible source material available. You see Fox owns all of the MTM catalog and had granted Shout the rights to distribute this show and so Fox is to blame for the transfers of this series set. Fox those greedy jerks probably figured that they will give Shout poor material intentionally so that It would give them (Fox) a security to be able to produce a proper Film to DVD transfer in the future for some double dipping, But as MTMS<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Show-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001RIYVYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Series</a>fans know that most likely will never happen.
Fox really sucks as a consumer home entertainment company.
Hmmm I wonder what the lettering on the box that states ""35th Anniversary Edition"" really means here?

Thanks to Shout Factory for at least trying and bring what they could to the fans. Shout had done very nice transfers for ""That Girl"".",1240444800,9,1484,5.261603375527426
3727468,5,B001O4KBN2,"It is too bad Shout Factory couldn't get better materials for the episodes of Season One from FOX, but that is what they were given, I am sure it was very hard for SHOUT factory to release the First Season as is, but I think if we were in their place and knew all the variables for this release some of us would not be so harsh towards the release. it has been noted on some websites they hope to get better materials for a Season 2 release if it can happen.

I have watched the first 4 Episodes and just sitting down and seeing the show again the first time in about 2 years for me was so great. It was like visiting old friends. This show is truly great and all issues aside the writing directing and casting make this series shine.

It isn't the greatest release the show deserved but I still recommend the show highly, it is wonderful to watch again.",1240358400,4,854,4.16969696969697
3727469,3,B001O4KBN2,"Remember how Mary Richards had a cameo in the ""Rhoda"" pilot?  Well, you're stuck with your memories because it doesn't happen in this new release.  I can't begin to explain how disappointed I am in this because I had been so eagerly awaiting it.  Reading some reviews online, 15 of 24 episodes are cut and the masters for many episodes are not in good shape.  But I do not blame ""Shout Factory"" entirely - they were given the best masters they could find and they do have disclaimers about the quality on each disc.  (As compared to some other studios who have tried to slip edited episodes by the consumer, hoping they wouldn't notice.)  Unfortunately, the best masters are lacking and that's disheartening.  ""Mary Tyler Moore"" prints are in beautiful shape on DVD; not so much ""Rhoda.""  But there is a glimmer of hope.  The hour-long special celebrating Rhoda's marriage to Joe is here in its entirety.  That's something at least!

""Rhoda"" deserves more than three stars, but the presentation is, unfortunately, lacking.",1240358400,8,1022,4.8497109826589595
3727470,1,B001O4KBN2,"The show is obviously beautiful but this DVD isn't: first of all the episodes are cut (where's Mary on the Pilot?), then the quality is unacceptable. This DVD is a total shame!!!",1240358400,41,178,4.59375
3727471,2,B001O4KBN2,"I went out today and purchased the eagerly awaited ""Rhoda: Season One"" on DVD. I just completed viewing the entire set and I'm disappointed to report that the quality is absolutely dreadful. The picture quality on the episodes included in this set range from fair to unacceptable. The worst being on disc 3, episode 4 titled: ""Whattaya Think It's There For?"" looks as if it was transferred from a VHS tape with lines in the screen and a jumping video image that looks as if it needs tracking (remember that on a VCR?). To their credit, Shout Factory includes a disclaimer at the beginning of each disc stating that episodes contained in this set are from the best source material available. I guess I should be happy that Shout Factory released it at all but, I'm sad for paying such a high price for an inferior quality product. I think with the state of other digitally remastered shows being released on disc I was expecting more.

The one special feature doesn't even include an interview with Rhoda herself (Valerie Harper) or Julie Kavner... what we do get are interviews with the show's creators James L. Brooks & Allan Burns basically discussing the same things they covered on the special features of the first season DVD of 'The MTM Show'. If fact, I believe it is from the same interview on that 'MTM' DVD set. Yes, nice to have the featurette however, like the rest of this release it left me wanting more.

Basically, this DVD set for the die-hard 'Rhoda' fan only which I think the makers of this release was banking on. I really don't think I'll purchase other season releases of 'Rhoda' if this is the level of quality to be expected.

Love the show. Always have, always will and it really holds up because it's so well written and acted. Don't love the DVD release! Sorry. Just expected more and I don't think it's alot to ask for with a nearly $40 price tag. This show is a classic that deserves more respect.

I'm curious to know the feedback of others regarding this release.",1240272000,15,1995,4.579831932773109

3727473,1,B001O4KBN2,"Reliable sources have let it be known that there is a strong possibility that the episodes on this DVD set will NOT be the original episodes broadcast on CBS from 1974-75.  The episodes may be the edited-down, syndicated episodes.  If this is the case then I am going to cancel my order; this is precisely what happened with Season 1 DVD of ROSEANNE.

3727474,4,B001O4KBN2,"It has come to light that approximately 2/3 of the episodes in the ""Rhoda-Season One"" set, are the edited for syndication versions. Fox holds the masters to ""Rhoda"", and they are said to be damaged. Apparently, Shout! did the best that they could do, and the choice was to release ""Rhoda"", as is...or not at all. Some of the footage that did make it to this release is quite flawed, and it is anything but pristine. A few episodes are unedited, such as ""Rhoda's Wedding"", ""You Can go Home Again"" and ""Along Comes Mary""...all personal favorites of mine. Since this is the only set of ""Rhoda"" that has yet to have been offered on dvd, I am not terminating my pre-order, as other fans have said they have. Shout has been quite clear on their website concerning the content of this dvd set. Of course, we all would like a perfect dvd release for ""Rhoda-Season One"", but it is what it is.

""The Shower"" has quite a bit of dialogue removed,too,I only hope any future ""Rhoda"" release, has the unedited pilot on as a special feature.

Now we purchased the first year of Rhoda and did not like it at all. There had been some kind of magic with Mary and Valerie in the Mary Tyler Moore show that did not happen here.
