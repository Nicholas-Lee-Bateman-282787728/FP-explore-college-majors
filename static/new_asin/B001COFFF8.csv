8288464,2,B001COFFF8,"While cheaper than legal consultation, there is very little meat to this product, and certainly not enough to justify the price tag.  There was no information in this DVD that I didn't already have from personal online research, which I would recommend over buying this product.  If you already have an existing business, you will either know enough to not need this DVD, or will have the funds and/or need for actual legal consultation in moving online.  If you are just starting a business, this will not give you enough information in any area to merit the cost.  I am sure Mr. Pepper knows what he is talking about, I just wished he would have talked about a whole lot more.",1245888000,,678,4.578512396694215
8288465,5,B001COFFF8,"As an online business owner this DVD has helped me with the legal issues -  ""I didn't even know I had!""

Mr. Pepper has produced a comprehensive DVD for the average everyday person perusing online entrepreneurship or for intermediate online business owners that may not be getting `the full picture' of the current legal issues - running a business online.

Getting the right legal advice can be a challenge; especially for those (of us) with tight budgets.  Most business lawyers seek retainers of $5,000 and hourly costs of $255 - and yet at these prices ... giving little confidence in understanding what the legal issues are for running an online business.

Not anymore!  Mr. Peppers DVD gives the information you need - but also the confidence of understanding your online business legal issues efficiently.

If you are serious about starting - or are currently an online business owner, than Mr. Peppers DVD is for you!",1220486400,,925,4.929032258064516
8288466,5,B001COFFF8,"As a storefront small business owner looking to expand into the online arena, I found this DVD to be extremely pertinent to my situation, as well as quite easy to understand.  There are certainly different legal considerations going from a bricks-and-mortar establishment to one with no state or even national boundaries, and Mr. Pepper does a fantastic job of describing and counseling the finer points of the online business environment.  Kudos!",1219881600,,447,5.28169014084507

8288468,5,B001COFFF8,"As a layperson just beginning to knock around small business ideas I consider myself fortunate to have found Mr. Pepper's video as an extremely helpful guide.  It is now with great confidence that I will pursue my business dream.  Although the process of starting a business can seem overwhelming, this video made me feel as if Mr. Pepper was sitting in my living room, and that he and I are just shooting the breeze.

8288469,5,B001COFFF8,"This DVD gave me an excellent understanding of what I needed to do to protect my online company.  It really made me rethink my existing privacy policy and gave me great tools for protecting my website and domain name.  I thought I had everything covered already but I was wrong!  Also, Mr. Pepper was very engaging as a speaker...makes it much easier to absorb the material covered when the speaker has energy and is entertaining!",1217980800,,430,4.706666666666667
8288470,5,B001COFFF8,This DVD provides for a very helpful understanding of the legal intricacies of starting an online business.  The format and content is much easier to follow when compared to other videos that I have used.  By taking potentially complex legal principles and putting them into plain English takes aware the usually daunting task of starting a new venture.  I highly recommend this product for anyone considering an online presence.,1217808000,,429,5.188405797101449
8288471,5,B001COFFF8,"I bought this title recently when I decided to start an online clothing business.  I purchased another video guide last month from a different author, but I found it difficult to understand.  I was very pleased with ""Legal Considerations for Starting an Online Business"".  I found it easy to understand, well organized and very informative.  The discussion about the different kinds of companies was particularly helpful in guiding me through the selection of the proper legal entity.  I highly recommend this title for anyone seeking to start an online business.",1216512000,,563,5.211111111111111
