2547181,5,B000EZ9084,"I saw this movie in high-definition (Showtime cable). Spectacular scenery, lush setting, in bright (shot in a beach) living color. Combined with the equally spectacular, stunning and gorgeous Miss Kelly Brook.  Amazon is going to have another DVD hit coming.

When Miss Brook walks away from the beach towards the camera,
with her God-given luscious beautiful breasts hanging out, it can send your heart  beat wildly, so this is a warning to men with heart problems! Yes, there are several scenes in the movie where she shows them in full living color! Also, fortunately when Miss Brook was washed away in the beach after a yatch accident, she was wearing a bikini, because that is what she wears in the entire movie!!! (I can hear the clicks now of guys pre-ordering the DVD!)  This movie is also for women. Think about it, 3 people stranded and trying to survive in a small island: Kelly Brook, Billy Zane (her suspicious husband) and a very handsome Spanish guy. And what do you have? There is romance, jealousy, intrigue, confrontation, some fighting and sex. Excellent dialogue and very good acting, too.

I will pay any price when this movie is released in HD-DVD. I
hope Amazon will price it below $[...] for the regular widescreen
DVD version.",1147824000,18,1251,4.827102803738318

2547185,3,B000EZ9084,"This DVD is an anomoly in so many ways that it may be worthy of attention from folks who would be interested in more than its softcore porn-y aspects.
While from a production standpoint, this DVD belongs to the family of British-originated (or British-market targeted) erotica, meaning that there are significant restrictions on what can be shown on-screen (i.e., no penetration, etc.), a fact that cute blonde model Kris alludes to during a scene featuring him in the shower.
However, this particular video is more than the watered-down ""Bel Ami"" video or ""naked sports"" fare that one traditionally expects due to its unusual genesis.  This DVD is in fact an extension on the hugely popular ""coffe table"" book of photographs of the same name (""Three"") by Howard Roffman.  The original book of photographs purportedly documents moments in the life of an all-male ""permanent menage a trois,"" in a fashion that largely idealizes the relationship among the participants.  Both the book and the video therefore trade not only on the attractiveness of the stars, but also on the voyeuristic tendencies that makes ""reality TV"" so intruiging to viewers.
Unlike most of the DVDs in this genre that present fictional or highly fictionalized plots, ""Three"" the DVD is a modestly insightful documentary, connecting the dots for viewers (somewhat predictably, alas) and shedding additional light on the nature of the relationship shared by the film's subjects that was first presented in the book.
Roffman himself becomes a fourth chracter in this drama, acting as the cameraman and interviewer.  Unlike most documentarians, Roffman is not an uninvolved third party; indeed, the origin of the relationship being documented is credited to the photographer, who actually introduced the three guys to each other.
Fans with romantic attachment to this exotic relationship as somewhat idealistically portrayed in the original book may come away disappointed.  While Kris comes off as playful as you'd want and far more smart and level-headed than you might expect, the ""original couple"" don't come off as well in living color.  Some of the rougher edges that were muted by subtleties of form and shadow in Roffman's black and white images come into sharper focus in a way that may reveal too much if you seek to retain the original story's ""romantic"" charm.
In this way, the documentary itself may actually succeed more than  had been anticipated.  There are interpersonal tensions and real-life concerns that are exposed by the documentary format which the still camera can not capture.
When taken in combination, the book and the video provide more than aesthetically pleasing, erotically charged images (though there's plenty of these to go around...)  Fans of Rofman's style of artistic/erotic photography are offered in this video the extremely rare opportunity to contrast the live reality with the still artistic impression of reality, at the same time presenting a unique insight into the interplay between the photographic artist and his subjects.",997142400,69,3039,5.249484536082474

The bad boy displays a penchant for letting his anger get the best of him so we see stormy seas ahead for this group.

2547206,5,B000EZ9084,"Survival Island is a really good suspense.  In fact it's a suspense in every sense of the definition, and a rather good one at that.  Perhaps the build-up is what makes it so fantastic since it begins innocently enough with everyone getting along despite some unusual moments in between that raise a few questions before eventually exploding into an entirely different monster.  While many people will probably only be watching it for Kelly Brook's character (yes she's a VERY attractive hottie, no question about it) the storytelling, suspense level, and interesting characters help make the film a near classic.

When a fire disaster leaves people helpless on a cruise ship, eventually two men and a woman are washed ashore.  It turns out that the one man and woman (Billy Zane and Kelly Brooks) are a couple, and the third man (played by the talented Juan Pablo Di Pace) has an enormous amount of love for Kelly that starts to make itself known but comes to a screeching holt once Billy's character is found lying down, exhausted but alive.  However, that doesn't stop this twisted love tale from developing!  No siree.

There's also a vengeful woman casting dark magic in a secluded location somewhere else completely, allowing the events of the three stranded people on the tropical island to unfold to her liking since she was betrayed by Juan's character early on. This aspect of the story was never really explained in detail might I add, so its inclusion is a bit mysterious but welcoming all the same since you often wonder where it's going and why it's there.

Anyway Survival Island works so well because of its love triangle craziness.  While Kelly honestly strikes me as a good girl for a majority of the storytelling by keeping herself in check and never allowing herself to come onto Juan's character (well, then again maybe not- I recall she does start to flaunt her way around comfortably on the beach towards BOTH men for a short time until Billy becomes too nutty/untrustworthy) Billy Zane doesn't believe his wife is being faithful.  He somehow has this knack for sensing what his wife has done and what she's thinking.  I guess she's not the type that can hide things very well (though I thought she did a good job for the most part!)  This is told brilliantly in a scene where Kelly finally gives in to Juan and they do it on the beach while Billy's underwater searching for food, and Billy questions it based on Kelly's reactions to his questions which is when the suspense factor really kicks in.

In fact Billy Zane being mentally confused and going ballistic and often saying inappropriate comments towards Juan Pablo because of jealousy and bitterness are some of the best lines in the movie.  He's a terrific actress, I'd say award winning for his role even.  I'd say all three are excellent actors and actresses though.  So for the majority of Survival Island these three have to do whatever it takes to survive on a tropical island with just their bare belongings and have to basically start over by building their own mini forts, learn to catch their own food and start their own fires for warmth at night.  While I admit a good portion of the storytelling is clearly put into place so viewers can check out Kelly's gorgeous body and at times the film has a very adult nature to it during specific sexual scenes, the suspense IS coming so you know, so it's worth it to keep watching.  Also wondering which man Kelly will pick in the end is another interesting element.

Another reason this is a good suspense is because I often wonder how Billy Zane and Juan Pablo will eventually settle their differences.  Obviously it's not going to end on a good note because of the constant friction between the two, but the way it happens is pretty good.  I think it could've been better though, without spoiling the ending.  I loved the boat segment.  Billy finds a boat later on.  I had a good idea what was going to happen there.  However the events afterwards were a bit surprising.  Again I won't spoil anything, but I'm surprised who got the advantage and gained control in a few instances.

Also it's VERY easy to make jokes about the content.  By this I mean, my dad and myself were watching the movie together tonight and coming up with all sorts of um, dirty humor related to the whales, crabs, fish, deep water... LOL!  Basically double references everywhere!

Overall, for those looking for a suspense that takes place entirely on a tropical island involving just three people, this is your movie.  One thing I love about a movie like this is that characters are FORCED to be developed fully, otherwise it wouldn't be much of a movie.  Perhaps it's unintentional character development since it's such a small cast of characters involved, but I'm happy for it all the same.  Brilliant acting, high amounts of suspense, and just fantastic the entire way through.",1427846400,,4893,4.724381625441696

Kelly Brook is a lovely lady who is built like a swimsuit model.  That's especially important in this film as she wears her bikini throughout the film.  There is some nudity, although not nearly as much as I was anticipating.  The scenery of the island makes a nice backdrop for her.

If you're looking for a realistic movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-Away/dp/B0026O475M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast Away</a>&nbsp;then this flick is not for you.  All 3 Thespians maintain their GOLD's GYM bodies in spite of being stranded for months & months.  Nobody slims down to being little more than a skeleton due to malnutrition.  Then again, gritty realism is not really the ""point"" of this movie.

All in all, this is a fun flick.  It's not your typical castaway movie where the characters end up working together to survive.  Nope, that would be just too easy.

2547238,4,B000EZ9084,"Overall, I thought it was a pretty good film...it was different.  If you are a man, you'll probably enjoy this movie just because of Kelly Brook.  She is hot...way hot.  And she's in a white bikini for the entire movie.  You also get to see her topless on a few occasions.  I was happy I bought this movie just because of her.  This film is probably also enjoyable for women just because of the drama basis.  It's a story of two men...and the wife of one...stranded on an island after an accident.  It's actually a story of jealousy.  Emotions arise within the characters.  The thing that impressed me the most about this movie, was the surprise ending; which I SERIOUSLY doubt you will guess.

  Now, this movie falls short of 5 stars for a couple reasons.  First of all, it's kind of strange because you find that none of the characters are likeable.  The sexy woman is selfish, her husband and the other guy are both complete jerks.  The other thing I should warn you about is...as much as I love the ending, (I won't give away any details), it's not necessarily a happy ending.  Plus, I thought they used a strange method of entertaining both men and women.  There's drama for women, and if you're a man you can just look at Kelly Brook.  (Again, she doesn't wear much the entire movie).

  Anyway, it's an enjoyable film.  Even if you don't like the drama in it...I suggest you pay attention just because of the ending, which I'm not sure I'll ever forget about.",1335916800,13,1467,4.473484848484849

There are def. similarities to Dead Calm although Dead Calm seems more realistic & dramatic IMO while this one is almost on the campy side with a voodoo ""twist"" to fill in ""plot holes"" & a ""convenient"" resolution between our two guys on the island.

Kelly Brook fans should like the amount of exposure she gets.  For me it could've been more but I guess they decided to keep it more on the tasteful side than downright exploitation.

Billy Zane gives a very interesting performance that is reminicent of Dead Calm at points for sure.  It's almost the same formula except there were actually people to root FOR in Dead Calm.  Not sure that's the case here but a fun movie IMO.",1323648000,5,864,4.39622641509434

Anyway,  the only thing keeping this one from getting the full five stars is that Kelly fails to deliver full nudity. Just one full nude scene would have done it for me. The toplessness and naked-from-the-rear scenes are good, but give us just a little more...",1279324800,2,538,4.536082474226804

2547249,2,B000EZ9084,"Caught this one night on cable.  I guess I should start with, I am a fan of Billy Zane.  I think he is a good intense actor and he does not disappoint in this movie.  As far as Kelly Brook and Juan Pablo di Pace go, well, this is where the weakness in the movie starts.

The movie is about a wealthy couple, Jack and Jennifer, who are stranded on a deserted island with Manuel their boatman.  The story in the beginning is simply about survival on a deserted island.  But it then quickly becomes about the struggle between Jack and Manuel with Jack's wife Jennifer being the mediator and eventual prize.

The strong parts of the movie are:

Billy Zane - He plays a good part of a jealous and suspicious husband trying to take charge of a situation in which he has no control.

The scenery: truly beautiful with some great shots underwater.

The Story:  Well the first half anyway's.

The bad:

Jennifer and Manuel:  You are supposed to like them, connect and root for them but it is impossible. Instead of being the victims they come off as the villains in the movie. This really messing things up.

The second have the movie: This is where they start to make Jack the villain and the other two the victims. It just does not work. Yes Jack is jealous and paranoid but for good reason. His wife is sleeping around. She has turned on him. How can you root for two people who don't care about the third, who with everything they do they hurt him. The movie wants you to root for them but I rooted for Jack the entire movie.

Like I said it had it's good parts but it was to infuriating to watch Jack get treated like dirt and then get blamed for getting mad for me to truly enjoy the movie.",1259107200,,1687,4.2578616352201255
2547250,2,B000EZ9084,"Caught this on cable.  It's a ridiculous plot with annoying characters and lengthy dialogue scenes that go on forever (which I fast-forwarded through), but there's some nice underwater scenery (no, seriously).

The only thing that makes this movie completely worth watching on cable, renting, or, at seven bucks, maybe even buying is Kelly Brook, who spends pretty much the entire movie looking AMAZING in a white bikini (very impressive assets).  She's also topless quite often, although, until the second half of the film, the shots are fairly quick.

There's also a couple shots of her bare butt, but no frontal nudity.  (Big continuity error when she goes skinny-dipping, but comes out of the ocean clearly wearing her bottoms.)

There's also a couple sex scenes; the first one early in the film with Billy Zane features Brook with her hands bound by a leather belt.  It's all very hot, but she keeps her arms in the air, well above her head, and it just looked artificial and silly, like Sharon Stone's sex scenes in Basic Instinct.  (Not that I'm complaining...)

But I had trouble dealing with how bald Billy Zane was.  I'm proud for him that he's willing to not go the Sean Connery route and cover it up with a rug, but it was still unsettling.  Oh, and I've always liked Zane, but his performance was awkward; maybe because his character's paranoia about his wife's fidelity (before she actually committed adultery) was absurd.",1248480000,5,1436,4.868312757201646

So as for the plot we have a rich couple (Zane and Brook) on a fishing trip with friends.  The boat promptly sinks and the couple, along with the poor deck hand Pablo, wash ashore on a deserted island with no food, and a few supplies.  Most notably goggles, a lighter, and obviously plenty of razors and shaving supplies as throughout their long stay on the island they all appear perfectly groomed.  The laws of late night cimemax kick in and a love triangle developes with the expected results.  I was entertained on my first viewing, mostly due to topless Kelly Brook and as another viewer mentions, there is a twist at the end.  Overall this effort by Zane and Brook is a notch above the standard late night cinemax flick.  I give three stars to ""Three.""",1195430400,61,945,4.459302325581396

2547270,2,B000EZ9084,"Well, I read somewhere in a review that this movie truly was meant for women. Myself, looking at Kelly Brook, I can't see how that remark is justified. In many ways it might be true since the concept and story is almost something you find in the typical cheap and dirty romance novels.

How is Kelly Brook's character, the heroine? Granted she plays the character of a beautiful slightly-dimwitted wife of a rich insecure jerk, stranded in a deserted island with an attractive Latin jack-of-all-trades. Typical and expected, the wife has an illicit affair with ""Manuel"" the Latin hard-throve. What bothers me really, is that the husband is made to be the villain, when his insecurities and suspicions where in fact correct and justified. He may have initially being a jerk, she married him anyway, perhaps for his ability to provide? Then again, maybe I am looking too much into this one than what it deserves.

To be really honest, I was channel browsing and had a sudden glimpse of Kelly Brook, so I put the remote control down. I only missed about 10 minutes of the whole movie. The dialog was horrendous and unnatural, in my opinion. Kelly was made to be really dumb and overly demure, and the couple doing the dishonorable act was made to be the victim and heroine, or survivor.

The concept and acting was shallow, vain, and superficial. The scenes seemed inconsistent. For example: a Tribal ritual is introduced at the end without anything ever leading to it.  This flick reminded me somehow of those old 1970s B movies of women in jail, etc. Where the acting was not of high priority. Again, two stars for Kelly's obvious ""Talents"" if you know what I'm referring to.",1164844800,14,1674,4.722602739726027

First Kelly arrives on a deserted island, followed by DiPace.  They initially spar and flirt, and then build a little hut and all is well until hubby Zane washes up too.  The romantic triangle is pretty predictable and Zane's performance is typically lifeless and wooden; Brook and DiPace look good but the storyline is spread out to meet the ninety minute timeframe without any real novelties, only a small surprise twist ending.
