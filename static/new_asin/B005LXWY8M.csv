As a mom I loved that it encouraged their own imaginations.  Great for children who love a good story!  Now my son is asking for Lindsay to come to our house as a babysitter!",1359331200,,350,4.257575757575758
8478768,4,B005LXWY8M,"Adorable movie. Educational and fun. Perfect for young children. Just long enough to hold their attention and plenty of playful action. Will spark their interest in geography, other cultures and folklore. My son and I will watch it again & again.",1355184000,,246,5.024390243902439
8478769,5,B005LXWY8M,"My kids LOVED this video!  My 6-yr-old son asked if there was ""another episode"" and my 4-yr-old daughter immediately went and found a stuffed monkey and crocodile so she could re-enact the story.  Lindsay Bonilla did a great job in encouraging kids to use their imaginations, learn about another country and culture, and think about the meaning of friendship.",1334880000,2,359,5.067796610169491
