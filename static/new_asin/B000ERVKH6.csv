8113908,2,B000ERVKH6,"The film stars Treat Williams and Huggy Bear. Antonio Fargas struggles with the accent which ranges from Mexican to Jamaican. The two live in paradise in Mexico away from the ex-wife (Janet Agren). The water is infested with intelligent shallow water sharks who can pull a boat by the anchor line. Not to worry, David (Treat Williams) can out swim and out hide those smart sharks. David's brother(Carlo Mucari) has some sort of mafia dealings where he blackmails them with a CD disc claiming to have information or something.

To make a long movie short, the disc ends up with David and the mob wants it back. This leads to...whatever except a night scene with sharks, the title of the film. The plot was confusing, but the movie wasn't that great that I really cared. It was funny in an unintentional way. This is not a horror film, but rather a crime/thriller in the loosest sense of the words.
