5319601,1,B009DE6HW4,"Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted...well, you get the point.  Like Hercules, Xena, Earth:FC and Andromeda, it is corny beyond belief.  The difference is that the other shows mentioned were still fun to watch, and this is not.  Usually, you get a sense if the characters have a chance at developing chemistry.  It was very apparent this would never happen.  I suffered through to the midpoint of episode 3, but that was it.  I knew it would be bad from the first 5 minutes of episode 1, but still gave it a shot.  Without a doubt the absolute worst iteration of Sinbad I had ever seen, and one of the worst shows on TV I had ever tried to watch.  Pure misery...",1372723200,2,672,4.450819672131147
5319602,5,B009DE6HW4,"This is a very entertaining series the pilot starts off with a tragedy and a curse placed by his own grandmother, that if he steps on land for more than one day he dies and he's also on the run from Lord Akbari who is still not satisfied with the blood debt and will resort to black magic to get his revenge.",1372550400,,308,3.9838709677419355
5319603,1,B009DE6HW4,WOW is this show bad. The Sinbad show from the 90's during the Saturday afternoon action slot was tons better. I could go into all the detail but it is too painful. Don't waste your money on this and don't scorch your eyes by watching it on TV either.,1372291200,,251,4.142857142857143
5319604,2,B009DE6HW4,"It seemed (from the first episode) to be slow, cliched and poorly done. It also seemed to stereotype people of the Middle East.

5319606,5,B009DE6HW4,"I came across this series while visiting Montreal last year on Canada's version of the Syfy channel (goes by another name but similar content).
It is an exciting, beautifully filmed production with a talented multi-ethnic cast of both older and newer faces. If you watch British TV productions you'll recognize the more established actors like the ever charismatic Orla Brady from ""Mistresses"", and be delighted by handsome Elliot Knight in the title role and gorgeous Estellla Daniels as Nala.
It's a very contemporary re-visioning with the same charms of the classic Sinbad movies- exotic locales, mystery, magic and monsters. The costumes are quite beautiful as well. It's all around a visual and entertaining treat!",1371340800,19,719,5.315789473684211

The why and where Sinbad began his adventuresome life is presented by a very imaginative writer. I enjoyed each and every episode and the way it ends makes this feel like a true ""prequel"" to the rest of the Sinbad stories. Good job!  Oh!

The very name conjures magic, adventure, impossible deeds and vanquishing monsters.

He, therefore, sails with an odd collection of friends on the ""Providence"" on his quest into destiny.

It was amazing how this story played out the strengths of each person.  It wasn't only Sinbad's story but rather the coming of age/into their own of each person involved in the journey.

I am sure there are other attributes in the series I am forgetting, nevertheless, they are there, you just have to watch it to discover them all these hidden gems that all humans should posses, but disgracefully do not.

The series has many positive points and worthy recommendations and advice to its audiences

Cinematographically faulty FX lack realism in some cases, as when ships are approaching the shore they do it quickly and with a full sale; in real life,these ships would end up on land about 60 feet from the water and everybody on board either dead or seriously injured.
There are other FX which are equally disproportioned , but there some good ones with credible physics.

This is a low budget production, don't expect the graphics of Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter. Producers have to pay millionaire salaries to these graphical experts.",1416009600,,1182,4.959595959595959

Many of the other Sinbad shows/ movies in the past had mainly European or Euro-American actors and very few of color.  This was not the case at this time in history, especially in the Middle East but has always been overlooked.  I really appreciate the creator's attention to historic detail along with having characters of many colors and origins.  The acting and plots weren't too bad either.

People rave about the writing of that series, but I think it was the caliber of the acting and the chemistry of the cast who greatly outshined their scripts.  If you were to watch Firefly with the sound off with closed captions, you'll see what I mean.

Sinbad is trying to duplicate the feeling of camaradarie of Firefly, but falls short.  I can't really articulate why.  But it makes me realize just how special Firefly was.  I'd describe Sinbad as adequate.  It's not a show that people will rewatch over and over and inspire a legion of Browncoats  demanding its revival.  It's a decent enough series to watch over a weekend if you're home sick with a flu or are snowed in and developing cabin fever.",1415664000,2,740,4.545454545454546

5319729,5,B009DE6HW4,"Sinbad was a great short lived series filmed in Kalkara, a small picturesque village overlooking the Grand Harbour in Malta.  I love action/adventure/fantasy shows that are packed with action scenes that are not the same old same old.  Sinbad had everything.  It had wonderful believably talented actors.  The cinematography was ""take me away"" beautiful.  The Special and Visual Effects were top notch and ""oh sooooo"" creative.  Costumes & Makeup were ""spot-on"".  So much of this show was what I look for when I want to watch action.  What I didn't like was the exit of ""Nala"", Estella Daniels.  [She is one of the most beautiful women and her hair, makeup and costumes keep me wanting to see Nala.  Elliot Knight was an awesome Sinbad and not bad to look at either.] And the fact that this series was cancelled abruptly.  Not sure of the specifics but I do feel this series could have continued and probably would have picked up many more viewers.  I think SKY1's  male dominated exes felt it more profitable to cancel the series and sell the rights.  Maybe because of a dip in viewing, but I don't think so.

I was afraid they would take a more comical or decidedly darker approach as is common with modern reimagining.  Instead, I found a well established storyline with solid acting and believable characters.  The mythical creature and other special effect were believable and well blended.  Too often these ""for TV"" works are on the lower B grade of graphics and special effects, but this series was, in my opinion, one of the better for effects on TV today.

Not too much and not too little.  Perfect for a solid reimagining of a classic.

The stories are written well enough to create suspense and usually evoke a smile or two as well. The talented cast, led by the very appealing Elliot Knight carries off each far fetched adventure without feeling campy.

I can't wait until season two comes out on DVD because I will surly buy it.  It is a bit dark and mystical at times but it is nothing a child could not watch at least in my opinion.

 The true makings of a good  show is the genuine plot,.. This show has steadily progressed into a full swing 2 point something show, what a disappointment.
 Then after it steadily decreases in excitement, and it really couldn't get any worse,..they introduce Bird face .
  I thought we had laughed Lee ""The Bird Face "" Ingleby  out of the business with George Gently.
 He is the worst actor to ever try to emerge from the UK. That was it,.. I considered it a waste of money and shut it down 1/3 of the way through the 8th ep.
 So damn  sad,..
 Acting has become like music did in the 90s,.. all you need is an uncle in the biz, or a bit of money , and you are in, No talent required.
 It is truly sad what Television has become.
 If there were more shows like ""Game of Thrones"", ""Downton Abbey"",""Walking Dead"", ""Justified"", and ""Intelligence"" maybe TV would still be worth watching,..
 However, you would have to get rid of 3/4 of the actors in the business to achieve that. There are just not enough 4 and 5 star shows to go around,..
 And as long as you cheesy lovers keep writing good reviews for programs such as this one, it will never change.

Of course, in the end, all the action in the stories is driven by the characters' personal matrices, which keeps the well-produced, action and fantasy elements relevant.

In future seasons, I hope there is deeper motivational grounding for a merging into a common, sustaining purpose for each character's continuing membership in the crew.  It would be great if the whole ship had a purpose, and if the crew's individual needs could be shown to be met by continuing on the journey, not just out of loyalty to each other.  Also, it would humanize the characters more, if they were shown at times to be pursuing perhaps hobby-like activities with a non-intense demeanor, singly and with others.  Then, gently weave those aspects into the main, high-energy plot.

8540244,5,B009DE6HW4,"A fun series that I begrudgingly give that fifth star. The premier episode is fabulous. But as the series wore on the scope of the stories shrank quickly. this was sad because the cast was great and the writing was consistent. Obviously the powers that were did not relegate the flow of the limited bucks in a way that maintained the level of the magic through out the first season. I very much liked the cast and the interplay between the inexplicable mix of nationalities ( and maybe even time periods).  There was a part Ray Harryhausen, part Terry Gilliam feel to production and that may have been part of the problem. The first episode set a bench mark they never quite hit again. And that may have been their fatal mistake.
  But that doesn't mean that Sinbad Season One isn't fun. It stands on its own merits quite nicely. But I think if one pays attention, one can see why the show didn't last. For what ever reasons,the producers did not support their young Sinbad properly. Ultimately the production visually starved to death. Sinbad is traditionally about spectacle. And they ran out of funds long before they ran out of episodes. It was a shame.
  BUT!!! That only explains why there are not ten seasons. The first season listed here is over all well conceived, impressively produced, and populated with a cast of interesting characters, creatures, and situations. It is a shame they could not maintain it with a life span like Hercules. We could have used eight or nine more seasons. Season One is a lot of fun.",1514505600,,1524,4.62962962962963
