The film is horrible! No storyline, bad acting, blech!",1438128000,,98,4.823529411764706
8627168,5,B00GSTHBMC,Awesome movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat for the most of the time.,1434844800,,71,3.5
8627169,4,B00GSTHBMC,"The movie is about police officers, that deal with riots and the people involved and about the personal relationships between the officers. It is quite interesting, usually 1h30 min is enough to satisfy someone's curiosity, but I think one would have loved to seen more about the characters. The movie makers should be quite pleased with the end result.",1394496000,,353,5.0
8627170,2,B00GSTHBMC,I just plan did not like this film. It appeared to be  cheaply made with bad acting . I hink I fell asleep while watching the thing .,1392249600,,133,3.75
8627171,5,B00GSTHBMC,"I knew that ""Riot"" was based on the 2011 London riots, but I wasn't expecting the depth of story about the lead subject (bad boy turned cop) to be so well written and acted! Admittedly, some of this film is SO well acted, it's difficult to watch (especially a rape scene towards the end of the film), but it is a fine piece of film work, which I would recommend for 18 and over.",1390608000,,378,4.121621621621622
