2728927,5,B000MEYKCS,"First of all, Horrorfest in general did not even come close to the claims it made. However, I was surprised how many people were so dissappointed in it. If you went to their site and watched the trailers, it was pretty clear these were indy B-movies.

A couple of the movies (Darkride stands out) really sucked. Most of them were OK at best. The only movie that stood out for me was the Hamiltons. Considering the low budget they surely had, I thought they did an excellent job of story telling and a good job with the effects.

However, I would recommend renting before buying it to make sure it fits your taste in horror movies.",1173830400,10,630,4.422413793103448
2728928,2,B000MEYKCS,"I saw four of the eight films offered at the HorrorFest. The one with the biggest hype was THE HAMILTONS. I don't know why - the audience I saw this with was walking out in droves (much more than they did for WICKED LITTLE THINGS and THE ABANDONED) once they realized that this was a no-budget slacker whiner fest with some horror movie dressing. The big, ""surprise"" ending is supposed to knock us out of our seats, but doesn't. The two star rating is because it didn't suck as bad as WICKED LITTLE THINGS.",1173830400,9,506,4.3936170212765955
2728929,5,B000MEYKCS,"I heard some good things about the filmmakers and the lead actor Cory Knauf when it was in San Diego, so I decided to see it. Loved it. I have a feeling Knauf will be on the ""next big thing"" list of up and comming actors.",1173571200,4,221,3.8260869565217392
2728930,5,B000MEYKCS,"THE HAMILTONS is a horror film directed by filmmakers who want to play with our perception of what a horror film is.

Sure, the filmmakers dress the walls of their basement cage with big wet splatters of blood, and bind their victims with tape and chain...but at the end of the day The Butcher Brothers care more about exploring the relationships between our family of orphan killers than the plight of the victims held down below. This is not a movie where some dumb teenagers go some out of the way place, do something ""wrong"" and then get hunted by crazed maniacs.

It is a movie about a good looking family that moves into your town--hardworking and on hardluck that just happen to have your daughter chained up in their basement.  It is this reason that THE HAMILTONS was one of the most recognized indie horror films of 2006 and most certainly one of, if not the best, of the AfterDark Horror Fest: 8 Films to Die For.

Featuring charming and often times hilarious performances by a talented cast the movie is a smart, fun, critique of American family values, what consitutes a family, and the dangers of letting adolescence blossom outside of a well constructed and tightly chained box.

A real treat.",1172448000,19,1208,4.652582159624413
2728931,3,B000MEYKCS,"Imagine if you will Near Dark with a dash of Audition and a pinch of over-acting, on a shoestring budget.

This is what The Hamiltons is.

Has its good moments, has its bad.

may have been filmed with a home video camera, still not too bad.

Hot girls though.

i was decently impressed, and that's ok.

2728993,4,B000MEYKCS,"I like it but I definitely don't love it.

I'll give them an ovation for attempting an original alternative and more intelligent approach to the genre of horror but the execution was spotty.
This sort of plot is a difficult maze to navigate and I think it's easy for the writers and director to lose their way occasionally; this needed to be orchestrated so precisely that it's not surprising that the viewer is going to be encumbered with working out a few vagaries.

I enjoyed the ending, it wasn't a cop out, thank God.
At first glance this film comes off as a gratuitously gruesome flick, so I felt the opening was clumsy, however, as the film progresses it finds it's footing and develops into an intriguing mystery rather than a run of the mill slasher flick.",1423267200,,765,4.576642335766423

This focuses more on the vampires themselves and their relationships with each other in a family dynamic.

I have to admit though I'm a Vampire enthusiast and I either am totally lenient or completely bias based on its content. To be fair this movie stands on its own feet, unlike the overall throwaway vampire or horror flicks that cater to the teen craze of unrealistically attractive characters that offer little to no value to a plot or story.

It's about 4 siblings trying to survive after the death of their parents. They've lived in six residences in two years.  Very shortly into the film, we find out that the sibs are kind of um....violent.  Yeah....violent with the exception of the youngest brother who is trying to make sense of his family.  The acting is wonderful and Cory Knauf is terrific as the little brother.  This movie does have blood and gore but not as much as you would expect for a horror film.  Where this film succeeds is that it actually has an intelligent script with relatable family issues. It also offers a not so surprising but a twist nevertheless at the end.

2729083,2,B000MEYKCS,"The Hamiltons (Mitchell Altieri and Phil Flores, 2006)

One of the hallmarks of the films picked up by the After Dark Horrorfest crew is that they're movies with a whole lot of potential that never manages to realize it. Depending on how much potential there is, these can range from mediocre to painfully frustrating. The Hamiltons is one of the latter, a movie with a fantastic premise that manages to blow it by being predictable at every turn.

The title family--oldest brother David (Samuel Child, from the recent April Fool's Day remake), youngest brother Francis (Godspeed's Cory Knauf), and fraternal twins Wendell and Darlene (respectively, Joseph McKelheer, also from the recent April Fool's Day, and Rent's Mackenzie Firgens)--have just moved to a lovely new house in a lovely new town. Since their parents recently passed away and David is still young, the family spend some time talking to social workers, but for the most part, they're left to their own devices. All well and good, except that the Hamiltons seem to have a thing for capturing young ladies and keeping them in cages in the basement. Francis, being the rebellious teenager, is not thrilled with the family's activities, and is documenting them on video as a kind of family project. Much of the footage here is presented as if taken from Francis' camera.

The biggest problem with this movie is that, if you've seen a handful of monster movies, you'll see the big reveal coming five minutes into the movie. I assumed for most of this the directors were simply trying to avoid using the word as a kind of hip ""this is a movie about ______ that we're not going to tell you is about ______"" angle, but no, it turns out they don't seem to want you to know that these kids are, well, what they are. If that's truly the case, the movie is a failure almost from the opening scene. I'd normally even consider being forgiving about that given something exceptional (acting, camerawork, script, etc.) about the rest of the movie, but there is no aspect of this that is better than mediocre. Not the worst of the After Dark movies, but a long, long way from the best. **",1248739200,2,2137,4.708556149732621
2729084,4,B000MEYKCS,"THE HAMILTONS

I have to say that out of all of the films in this series this happens to be one of my favorite ones. Sure the film is flawed like most others but for the budget I truly believe this is the best they could do. I would love to this with a bigger budget because even at this one it was still great and a cool take on........... well you will see. I watched this long ago when it was first released and was thanking the filmmakers because the others in the series were a little lackluster. I would recommend this film to any fan of independent films and just over all good films.

For those who have yet to see this it follows a nice little family of siblings, their parents died and now they all live together moving on. It seems that they can't stay in one place to long even though they seem to be a nice bunch of kids. David is he oldest and is now the man of the house, a job that seems thankless. Then there are the twins Wendell and Darlene who play nice with each other if you get what I mean. And then of course there is the youngest in the group Frances who is your average teen who is out there just looking to find his place in the world. Other then a little incest with the twins this seems like a nice group of kids to the outside world right? Well all is not what it seems because underneath all that goodwill there is a dark secret that the family is hiding. Turns out this family likes to kill other people, all that is except Frances who is contemplating turning in the family.

I have to say that the only thing weighing this film down is the budget constraints and maybe some of the performances seem to lag at times but still this is good. Cory Knauf was great as Frances and played the confused teenager very well, plus I like how some of the story was told through his home camera. Samuel Child as ok as David but at times he seemed a little off, but then again that may have been the character. Then of course there are the twins played well by Joseph McKelheer and Mackenzie Firgens, both turn in good performances each. Every one else in the film were good as well but this film is about the family more so then the victims so we will leave it at that.

Writer/directors The Butcher Brothers did very well with a very low budget and pulled off one of the best in this series. Their direction is good but their real triumph is in the script, this was a really interesting story with a great outcome. Like I said they put a cool spin on something that is very familiar, you will see. The film was shot well but it doesn't look as good as some of the others in the series, budget once again. I need to check out the other film by these two, if it is near as good as this I can buy it without even watching it first. It should also be noted that Adam Weis was a writer on this as well so credit should go to him as well.

This is a very entertaining film that is one of the better ones in the series of After Dark, maybe the best of the first year, maybe. Still this is a worthy addition to any home library so I recommend a purchase and skip the rental. If you do not like low budget films because of their look or something this may not be for you.

The lighting and photography are on the same level as your grandma's home video of a trip to Wal-Mart. The story has something to do with a family kidnapping girls and having their pleasure in the forms of torture and death.

Hmmm, haven't we seen THAT before--like a zillion times? The cast really looks like a group of college kids who were rounded up to put in some time in front of the camera so they could put this on thier resume. The characters are cold and repulsive. The movie itself is one big snooze-fest. But then this is part of the hideous After Dark movie series--and everytime I see one it turns out to be worse than the one before.

The whole story about a family of psychopaths who are psychos ""just because"" doesn't really work. The acting was decent, it had to be to hold the weak, slow, plodding story together.

three brothers and a sister live together after their parents deaths. the oldest(mid 20's) is the most mature and resposible of the bunch. the twin brother and sister (early 20's) are the impulsive ones, and nearly out of control. the youngest brother is the docile one, constantly second guessing thier actions. he is the center of the film. a lot of time is spend focusing on his life and how he handles everything he's been partly responsible for.

pretty low bugdet stuff here. though not much lower than any others from the Horrorfest series. it really doesnt take away from the movie though. i didn't find it ""scary"" at all, and there isn't much blood and there's really no gore to speak of, but i found the overall experience very rewarding when all was done.

2729107,5,B000MEYKCS,"Personally, The Hamiltons is the best of the 2006 HorrorFest Films.  Unlike Dark Ride, I felt that the style and plot are more original than most recent horror films.

Some reviewers are focusing on the torture of ""hot"" girls and using that as a basis for comparison to Hostel.  However, the torture of these girls is not the main part of the film.  When I think about this film, Hostel most definitely is not the first movie that comes to mind, but I can see why it would be, for some people.  The torture scenes are not an immense part of the film.

The playbacks of the entire family, with the parents, is what sticks out most in my mind.  The characters are easy to relate to.  What would you do if your parents died and your family was left to survive on its own?  The Hamiltons are doing the best they can.  They may seem a little crazy, but keep in mind that they are doing what they know.  Even though the twins are especially violent, they understand the meaning of family.

Keep in mind that this film is horror based on its subject matter.  Just because it is not ""scary"" does not mean it is not horror.  As another reviewer said, it might make you think twice about the guy at 7-11 who stares at ""hot"" girls, or your banker, or cashier at WalMart.

But when the movie finally explains the siblings' motives, it's clear their methods were not necessary to achieve their ends. So this film just ends up being an excuse to show girls being caged and tortured.

There is a touch of humanity in a tentative romance that develops in this film and that partially redeems it. But on the whole, the acting tends to be a bit amateurish and the film has rather cheesy production values. So this ends up being a low-rent ""Hostel.""

If you liked ""Hostel,"" you might not mind. But if you prefer more classic, character and plot driven chills, this film will probably just leave you feeling wasted.

2729109,3,B000MEYKCS,"Speaking as a long-time horror fan, I was pleasantly surprised by The Hamiltons. This very low-budget horror film does a great job of creating and sustaining a gloomy, 'rainy-day' atmosphere that seeped into my consciousness. Credit a very polished score in helping achieved this. And despite its obvious flaws - largely due to budgetary restraints and the filmmakers lack of experience - it still ranks as a solid genre entry that  deserves a B for effort and a C for execution.

Despite negative reviews on this site to the contrary, I did NOT find this film ""boring"" at all. However, if one suffers from ADD and/or childish impatience then I'd urge you to find something better-suited to deliver the senory overstimulation to which one is accustomed/enslaved. The Hamilton's pacing is slow (or better yet, ""unhurried"") by design. It adds to the film's somber tone and harkens back to a time (the late 60s - mid 70s) when pictures like Rosemary's Baby, Let's Scare Jessica To Death, Crowhaven Farm, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Don't Look Now, etc. proved that a slow pace need not be looked upon as a liability to a horror movie - in fact, it could add to its sense of menace.

Bottom line: I would recommend it - providing that you keep your expectations in check and are comfortable with a horror movie that is more interested in creating and sustaining an unsettling mood than in delivering a rapid-fire onslaught of violence and gore.",1194393600,2,1441,4.779116465863454

Teenager Francis (Cory Knauf) is tired and disgusted of what his family is doing, all the while he tries to supress his own urges.  Written and directed by newcomers the Butcher Brothers, The Hamiltons injects new life into the genre while throwing on generous amounts of blood, sex, incest, and more that even the most jaded horror fans will enjoy on some level or other.

Before I tell you what I like about this one, let me tell you what I wasn't liking about the others:

I have great hope in horror movies, because it seems that this genre might be one of the most visceral mainstays of creativity in the movie business nowadays.  The essence of that creativity is its accessibility--it seems that just about anyone can make a horror movie (and does).  They are famously low budget, and many big names have made their starts in horror movies--two of the most famous now would be Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson.  And horror movies don't have to be high-grossing to be famous--just go on eBay and find tons of stuff relating to 'cult' movies, movies that maybe only ever saw the light of day in local theatres or on video, but spread by word of mouth (and, let's face it, drunken parties) over years until they became famous.  Also, I think horror movies are wonderful for being able to reinvent themselves--horror movie makers are for the most part very well versed in horror, so while some may make run-of-the-mill horror, there are those who make horror movies that acknowledge the long history before them and stack themselves on top of that tradition either by playing with the form (as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>) or bring it down to its most visceral roots of splatter, gore and fun (as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>).

I was hoping for either of these in spades with the HorrorFest movies, but unfortunately, many of them were reminding me that there are also a lot of crap horror movies in the world, and that sometimes people get their friends together and make a horror movie because they just don't have the talent or creativity to make anything good, so they just work up on old formula.  A lot of HorrorFest films were being little more than the usual formula in a new setting, doing the usual formula without bringing anything new to it (the ones that mostly come to mind for this were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Ride-After-Dark-Horror-Fest/dp/B000MEYKBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Ride - After Dark Horror Fest</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penny-Dreadful-After-Dark-Horror-Fest/dp/B000MEYKE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penny Dreadful - After Dark Horror Fest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unrest-After-Dark-Horror-Fest/dp/B000MEYKDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unrest - After Dark Horror Fest</a>).

This film, however, was the first one I watched without continually checking the elapsed time or getting the urge to fast forward through the obvious parts.  This is also a film that is served well by its preview, a rare thing, for of late I have been finding a lot of previews to be either lies or giving away too much and thus making the movie less interesting to see.

This film is probably best summarized as a mixture of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-Two-Disc-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a>.  The Hamiltons are four children who have been orphaned and are left to fend for themselves.  Part of this fending for themselves involves the murder of transients and the housing of bodies, live and dead, in their basement.  There is also a mysterious creature, Lenny, locked up in their basement as well.  David, the oldest, tries to be the authority figure, while the twins, Darlene and Wendell, are the wild guns of the family and constantly threaten to act impetuously and reveal the secret that David has been working hard to keep in the family.

Francis, the adolescent, is unfortuantely going through his own rebelliousness and his own family squabbles over murder and kidnapping.  This makes for a dynamic that is very driving and not dependent on a heavy wading through the usual 30-minute lead-up before the blood starts flying.  This film might depend a little too much on a twist ending which didn't seem necessary or all that surprising (I am not going to spoil it here, though I think some other reviews here already did), for the drive of this movie is to see how this family works and what goes wrong and how they get through their lives with their secret or 'disease,' as Francis calls it, but the conflicts and the challenges they all go through are interesting and bring monster (and monster family) genre to a new height.  There is of course an innocent social worker who has no idea of the kind of family he is working with, and Darlene has a friend who future does not look too bright, but this kind of predictability is only secondary to the dynamics among these kids, whose lives have been taken to extraordinary heights, so they must respond in like.

So far, this is one of the best Horror Fest movies that I've seen.  I still have two more, so I'm hoping that I just started on the wrong end of the list and have a couple more decent movies to get through.",1183161600,34,5790,5.910179640718563
2729113,4,B000MEYKCS,"I wasn't going to watch this movie because the last few from the 'After Dark Horror Fest' didn't quite live up to my expectations. However, for lack of anything better to watch I decided to give this one a try. And I'm glad I did.

This is the story of 5 siblings who survive their parent's death (which is never explained). The story is told through the eyes of 'Francis', the troubled teen of the bunch who sets apart from the older ones. In this movie he is chronicling his family and at various times vomiting as a result of it.

The older siblings spend a great deal of their time killing victims for their blood. Some they keep alive and drain slowly, some they just savagely kill. Some blood is frozen for later use and sometimes they just feast.

Francis' story is one of reconciling his heritage with moral thinking. In the end he, of course, has to give way to his heritage.

There is also a younger brother who's kept locked up because of his hedonistic approach to blood consumption.

At the end of the movie this family has to move because they've made errors of judgement in choosing victims. So, they pack up and move on.

There were a number of things I liked about this movie. First of all, it's a fresh approach to the vampire theme. At one point Francis tells his soon to be victim that they are not made, they are born just like everyone else.

Other things I liked a lot were the 'raw' appearance. Music was minimal, sets were simple. I also liked how they fed the plot. It was as if we stepped into this family at some point in time. They played out days as though that was how it just was. No explaining the past, they lived in the present.

What this film lacked was a polish. I believe when introducing a new take on something it is good to have fresh faces. But the acting was lackluster except for the sister. She played her part exceptionally.

All in all, I'm glad there's at least one other good movie in this collection and I would recommend it if you like subtle horror.",1180915200,,2002,4.331550802139038
2729114,3,B000MEYKCS,"I love the idea of the ""After Dark"" fest, and my wife and I were able to see THE GRAVEDANCERS at a movie-theatre and enjoyed it pretty well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gravedancers-After-Dark-Horrorfest/dp/B000MEYKDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gravedancers - After Dark Horrorfest</a>&nbsp;So the chance to catch a couple more on DVD was something we looked forward to.  We knew these would NOT be classic movies that would live forever...we were just looking for a little cheap fun.

THE HAMILTONS lives up to the ""cheap"" part.  It was shot on digital video, and often appears grainy.  It was primarily shot on one location...which can be okay...but for this film it felt a little forced.  The editing was a bit choppy, and for much of the movie, we're seeing it through the eyes of the main characters video camera.  After a while, this started to feel like an excuse for random images and poor cinematography...""Hey, this guy isn't a great filmmaker, so if we show everything through his lens...no one will realize WE'RE not great filmmakers either.""  I don't mind low-budget films at all...I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed plenty.  But the combination of DV, generally spotty lighting, poor editing and amateur-hour acting for the most part just made it hard to get past the chintzy feel.

The movie does have some decent writing and plotting, though...which make it worth 86 minutes of your time.  At first, you feel as though you are about to watch a low-budget HOSTEL or WOLF CREEK.  The Hamiltons are a ""Party of Five"" household (dead parents, teens trying to eek out a living on their own) that has a strange compulsion to capture people (mostly young women, of course) and tie them up in the grimiest and largest cellar ever to grace a normal looking suburban home.  We believe we have some idea of why they do it...particularly when we learn about their youngest sibling...who lives in a cage down in the cellar and appears to be incapable of anything but growling and thrashing about.  But then certain things that happen make you begin to question your preconceived notions of the kind of film you're watching.  By the end...things have been turned fairly well topsy-turvy.  It was a brilliant twist...but it was fresh and unexpected enough to make me smile with a kind of ""okay, that was actually kind of clever"" feeling.

Once the movie was over, we actually discussed it for 5-10 minutes instead of immediately putting it away, never to be mentioned again.  We'll certainly never watch it again...but I'll probably always remember THE HAMILTONS.

(PS:  If you're looking for gore, the movie actually offers very little.  It always cuts away a moment before.  There's plenty of blood...but nothing too graphic.  If you're looking for nudity...there's one BRIEF scene with a very obvious body double...otherwise it's just a lot of inappropriate kissing.  But the turning away from the most explicit actually DOES allow your imagination to run wild just a little bit, adding to the creepiness factor.)",1180828800,5,3070,5.145161290322581

At any rate, THE HAMILTONS are a family of three brothers and one sister trying to adjust to the deaths of their parents.  David, the oldest, is trying to be the head of the family; the twins Darlene and Wendell are the rebellious type; and youngest brother Francis is the quiet, morose one, obsessed with his video camera. And oh yes, they kidnap and torture several victims, which forms the core of the movie:  why are they doing this?

Despite its low budget, the film is an original one but it is also manipulative, confusing and only moderately well acted.  But the horror fest is an interesting collection of horror movies that overall are quite entertaining.  This is just not one of the best of the lot.",1175817600,5,962,4.526011560693641
2729122,5,B000MEYKCS,"I'm not going to say anything about the plot of this movie just read the vague plot synopsis amazon provides it's perfect.  The biggest reason i gave this 5 stars is for its creativity and originality.  I love movies and horror movies are great i've seen alot, and in an era with so many remakes some good some bad, and really most movies whether they bare the same title are basically a remake in one way or another of someone else's idea.  That's fine and it's paying homage and it's still enjoyable.  I did not expect this movie at all i basically was on a horror movie kick and hadn't seen a good one in a while.  As far as 2006 i thought Slither, The Descent and Hard Candy were real good.  I even thought final destination 3 was fun.
Fangoria gave this movie there seal of approval and  Entertainment Weekly  listed it as one of there favorites in the After Dark Horrorfest series.  The last great albeit disturbing horror movie i saw was Funny Games which was so raw and so real, this movie doesn't have the same powerful performances but it makes up for it with it's original idea.
Hopefully a few people who really like horror movies and appreciate original ideas read this and watch it, hope you like it as much as i did.",1175817600,6,1231,4.364035087719298
2729123,2,B000MEYKCS,"I generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films, while trying to be cutting edge, usually smack of just ""trying""...too hard.  I gave ""The Hamiltons"" a go since it received the most hype.  Wasn't impressed.  Yes, the ending has a nice little twist, and I was intrigued by seeing Lenny--although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming--the film lacks dramatic tension, contains mundane dialogue (victim: ""help me""; predator [whining]: ""I can't!), and characters are pretty much stock caricatures. 86 minutes drrrraggged by.",1175472000,10,552,5.25
2729124,2,B000MEYKCS,"Not surprisingly, the AFTER DARK FILMS are weak or average...The hype is silly.

If you want a movie ""too scary or whatever for general audiences"" may I suggest Henry:Portriat of a Serial Killer, heck, even American Psycho pulled more intensity than these films.

The Hamiltons was Ok at best, The feature was what it was, low budget horror, fine... love them... but, I failed to see what was so impressive, it looked, felt & unfolded by the standard formula, like thousands of others released all the time...I suggest a rental even for hard core horror feinds like myself before buying it...

Worth a watch if you see nothing else on the rental rack, nothing more...nothing less...",1175299200,7,682,4.862068965517241
2729125,4,B000MEYKCS,"I loved this movie. Sure, there was gore, but not overdone. The story took  prescedence. The angst of the younger brother was familiar to every family. His angst happen to be about fitting in a family of monsters, but the audiance could relate by subbing that with anything. The wilder, older siblings painted a picture of rebellion and sewing wild oats that almost everyone in that age group goes through. Everytime the audiance relates to regular family attributes, the monster part of the movie reminds us that this is a horror film.

This is a very good, entertaining movie. It is a fresh horror movie with a mostly original twist. I was never bored or felt that the killing was overkill. I would recommend this movie to every true horror fan, especially those who are tired of slasher movies with no story.",1175126400,4,811,4.704225352112676
2729126,3,B000MEYKCS,"Ranking the eight movies from the After Dark Horrorfest would be an interesting way of developing a psychological profile, at least when it comes to enjoying horror films.  That's only 40,320 possible combinations, so that it is mathematically possible that at a given screening of Horrorfest 2006 last November no two members of the audience could have ranked the eight films in the same order.  It all depends on your taste in horror films and Horrorfest certainly provided you with a wide range of examples.  For me and my peculiar way of looking at the world ""The Hamiltons,"" the last of the eight that I saw that weekend, earned the low spot on my personal totem pole.  However, clearly there are those who will rank it higher and some who would place it in the top slot.  There is enough here to make it worth checking out and making up your own mind, which is true enough of the entire Horrorfest roster.

""The Hamiltons"" starts off as something like a variation on ""Party of Five"" as the four Hamilton siblings try to settle into a new house and a new routine following the death of their parents.  David (Samuel Child) is the oldest of the kids and he is clearly trying to dress and act like a responsible adult in order to keep the family together.  Unfortunately his younger siblings are making that quite difficult and it looks like David might finally be reaching the end of his rope.  The main problem is Wendell (Joseph McKelheer), who likes to go out bring young women home and take them down to the basement to work out his violence issues, and when he is not doing that he is getting overly familiar with his twin sister Darlene (Mackenzie Firgens).  Meanwhile, Francis (Cory Knauf) is at the age where ironically he would be wishing his parents were dead, but since they are he is totally embarrassed by the family he has left and wants them to leave him alone while he unburdens himself with his video camera.  Then there is something locked up in a room in the basement (a big question here is whether being ""brought out of the box early"" is a good thing or bad thing.  But the big question becomes what is Francis going to do about the latest girl Wendell has brought home.

The premise of this debut effort by the Butcher Brothers is fairly interesting what with the whole idea of what happens to the family that does whatever it is the Hamiltons are doing together.  I have seen the argument that ""The Hamiltons"" represents some sort of scathing look at suburbia, the dark side of ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" or some such, but I do not see that as being an apt characterization of what is happening here.  What is happening in the basement is certainly unpleasant enough and the dilemma that Francis faces regarding betraying his family has some resonance, but overall the casting and performances work against these elements as far as I am concerned.  Wendell is so over the top that it is impossible to believe that he does not end up in the slammer all of the time.  The other problem is that in the end ""The Hamiltons"" turns on a twist on a par with what we saw in the old E.C. horror comics like ""Tales of the Crypt.""  This provoked the traditional Peggy Lee response and the overall verdict here is two steps backwards for every step forward.

I was happy ""The Hamiltons"" was the last film we saw that Sunday, not counting ""Snoop Dog's Hood of Horror"" later that night, because my worst fear was that the ""8 Films 2 Die 4"" would all be low-budget films like this one.  Not that there is anything wrong with such films, but I was hoping for a series of horror films that would give me nightmares and that did not happen.  These were hardly cutting edge horror films, but all things considered they were certainly more interesting than the average direct to video horror films that I have seen in the past year.  For the record, the order that these films were shown in the theater (at least in the Zenith City) was (1) ""Reincarnation,"" (2) ""Unrest,"" (3) ""Dark Ride,"" (4) ""The Gravedancers,"" (5) ""The Abandoned,"" (6) ""Penny Dreadful,"" (7) ""Wicked Little Things,"" and (8) ""The Hamiltons.""  That is if you went to the first showings starting in the afternoon.  If you went to see the three films starting in the evening then it goes (3), (1), (2), (6), (4), (5), (7), and (8).  But since ""The Abandoned"" got a general release as the ""best of show"" selection, it is not part of this DVD release for the other seven.",1174780800,5,4437,4.530075187969925
