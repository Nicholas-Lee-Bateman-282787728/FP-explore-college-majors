2828532,5,B000PW9W3Y,Delivered quickly....it's a Christmas gift! My youngest son requested this DVD set so I know he will love it! I know it will keep him busy !,1354665600,,140,4.222222222222222
2828533,5,B000PW9W3Y,"For anyone that actually trains for knife defense or in any blade-based martial art, ""The Warrior's Edge"" by Cold Steel's Lynn Thompson is a must have. I have been training in Kali and Silat for 15 years and this 3 DVD set has allowed me to take my training to the next level. As anyone who has done knife sparring knows, the flow drills and closer simbrada-range stuff goes out the window when it's knife vs. knife. The adrenaline starts pumping and you start going into basic gross-motor movement and skill as physical or emotional exhaustion sets in. These videos teach you how to train the basic skills in a way that lets you get really good with consistent practice. Lynn Thompson shows practically(in my opinion) how less is really more. You won't see X-blocks or anything that might get you killed. You won't see flashy dojo ballerina moves either. What you get is about 6 hours of hardcore instruction that is a distillation of literally years of training into a single resource. There are also some very cool things you won't see anywhere else. If training the knife is your bag or if you ""think"" you know knife defense you need this video set. If you are like me and have trained a martial art for many years it will help you recognize dangerous habits you may have developed and fill a critical gap in your training. If you are a beginner to training the knife, this instruction is formatted so you can take your time as you develop your skill. All of the pieces of information you need for a solid foundation are in there.",1309478400,33,1534,4.541516245487364
2828534,5,B000PW9W3Y,"Disregard the review of the ""a reader from Illinois"". Other than their tasteless attacks on the moral integrity and character of Instructor Thompson, their review is simply the views of a mind twisted by beliefs that aggressors lives have equal value to that of the victim, and that only police forces have the rights to intercept occurring crimes with lethal force. Simply put, the view of the typical socialist, who does not believe that one has the right to defend their life, liberties or properties. I am quite certain that this ""reader"" feels that a woman or possible lone bystander must simply allow said woman to be raped by a group of unarmed men, simply because they do not intend to kill her and do not possess a weapon. Anyone with any shred of sanity who realises that sometimes you are the only one that can save you, will greatly appreciate this no nonsense approach to street fighting with a blade and I make a special mention that this is perfect for women.

Despite his allegedly ""uneducated"" accent, courtesy of our friend ""reader"", Instructor Thompson provides an incredibly detailed insight to the world of realistic knife fighting. This DVD set covers absolutely everything you could possibly need in a dire situation in regards to long ranged knife fighting. I especially liked how he would explain why what he is teaching you is so important. For example, he makes it clear that unlike many combat situations, footwork is more vital than any other aspect. He goes on to explain that provided your knife is shaving sharp (which he discusses in depth also, with a particularly unsettling story that occurred involving a blunt blade to prove the point), no strength is require and therefore being able to move fast on the feet to evade, retreat and pursue are more important. I found this nice as it motivates you to do things which are otherwise tiresome and lead you to neglect them. I also love how he provides activities and ideas to incorporate the techniques into interesting, effective drills.

Other great aspects of this DVD set include additional knowledge and skills not taught in knife fighting schools. For example, he goes on to teach you techniques using the point of a blade, which he mentions is often neglected in most arts. And clearly what our biased little friend must have missed for his review is that Instructor Thompson does teach less-than-lethal tactics. One such occasion, Instructor Thompson clearly states the aim of learning the tactic of dragging the point of a blade on an aggressor is not to seriously injury or kill them, but to cause them pain and instill enough fear to encourage them to cease attacking you.

I have more than a decade of martial experience, and I speak from experience that this DVD set is the most bang for your buck when you compare the knowledge given to you at the price you pay. Everything is easy to learn, uncomplicated to execute and from what I have gathered in sparring works a treat. It is designed to work in the real world, regardless of your strength, sex or age. I cannot recommend anything better than this, and I cannot understand why you would bother looking anywhere else. You will not find anything better than this, period. I can absolutely guarantee that if you are serious about realistic self-defense, you will be thoroughly impressed and well equipped to survive.",1296259200,55,3364,4.8166089965397925
2828535,5,B000PW9W3Y,"Which is what I think of the first reviewer's comments as well as the fairie-like notation from the commenter.  I don't know what never-never land these guys live in, but when you are fighting with knives you are dealing directly with life and death.  ""Oh golly, did I cut you?"" just will not do.  Michael Janich is a master with a knife but neither I, nor many others, can achieve the competence he exhibits in his video to the point where I could survive a knife fight with his techniques.  At least with what Lynn Thompson teaches, it might be brutal but I might stand a chance.  If you are standing there wondering if you might commit murder by being in your knife fight, then your only chance is to run and hope you are faster on your feet than your opponent.  And then there is the comment that Mr. Thompson's speach does not sound educated enough to teach us how to handle a knife.  I'll have to remember to bring my college degree if I get in a fight.

I'm putting my copy of the Warrior's Edge up for sale.  If someone buys it, I can only hope he reviews it in order to get another opinion.  I'd like to see if I'm the only person who doesn't think I commited a boo-boo if I kill someone in a knife fight.",1271462400,28,1214,4.193965517241379
2828536,2,B000PW9W3Y,"This is an odd video set.  The instructor, who is apparently the owner or president of Cold Steel Knives, seems to know about knife technique, but manages make those techniques into an endlessly complicated activity.

What makes the video set truly odd is the relish he seems to take in all the various kinds of damage one can do with a knife.  This leads me to suspect that he's either a sociopath or, more likely, has never been in a real knife fight.  I believe most people who have actually used a blade in earnest are far less sanguine about what a knife can do.

There is another serious weakness here.  Although he occasionally in the course of the series tells the viewer not to use a knife in less than lethal circumstances, he also on several occasions tells us to perform actions that would most likely lead to our playing soap tag in a penitentiary shower room.  On one occasion he has us using a knife on several unarmed miscreants because they're beating us up.  I'm sorry, but that is the use of lethal force against unarmed people even if we only want to hurt rather than kill them. In another instance he shows us a disarm of a knife fighter and tells that then we should kill him with our knife.  Again, the police would not look sympathetically on such behavior.  It goes on.  In the end, I suspect this all Walther Mitty stuff...the imagination of an ineffectual man run rampant.

Additionally, the instructor's voice is unpleasantly without resonance and his accent is  rather uneducated. If you really want to learn about knife fighting, start with Marc MacYoung, then proceed to either Paul Vunak or Mike Kanarek or both.",1235779200,18,1644,4.608247422680412

I'm no pro, but I didn't find anything interesting here. It's likely that the five star reviewers work for him too!",1455840000,,317,4.781818181818182
8193571,4,B000PW9W3Y,"Its just great!!!
I have been practicing japanese Martial Arts for more than 18 years and i have seen more than a few vids on knife fighting, but this is the first time that i see a video explaining the complete curriculum of a knife fighting method step by step from easiest to hardest (Note that i use the word method because i think it could be usefull for and adapted to any other fighting practice or style). IT REALLY TEACHES YOU HOW TO FIGHT AND PROTECT YOURSELF WITH A KANIFE IN REAL CONDITIONS NO NON SENSE.
One should always train Martial Techniques under the guidance of a qualified instructor and no video is gonna change that, but with this video, both instructors and novices alike could become very skilled knife fighters. Also, i admire the fact that Lynn C. Thomson  (President of Cold Steel) himself explains and shows every technical aspect of the curriculum.without trying to sell his knifes every 5 minutes.
I don't award it the 5 stars though, because - being Lynn Thomson the source of credibility of this video - all the attention centers on him as he talks, for long periods of time on some occassions, so i had to be very patient knowing that the content is very good.
I would recommend to the producers: 1.- A female co-host (OK it could be a male co-host if you don't wanted it to look like an infomercial), 2.- Some female sparring partners, 3.- Explain how to apply some of the techniques to dangerous situations in which women could be usual victims, 4.- Lynn Thomson could narrate  in VOICE OFF while other persons execute a few techniques, 5.- I would have inserted between techniques some examples of them being applyed in real scenarios (soldiers fighting in the jungle or in the desert, uniformed police officers using defensive tactics against a knife, a nurse using a knife to repel a knife assault in a dark parking lot, etc I KNOW ITS A LITTLE 80 BUT I LIKE IT), 6.- I would invite an important knife fighting instructor from the military to portray his opinion about some of the tecniques (Like in a discovery channel documentary), and 7.- I would have finnished with some testimonials.",1432857600,3,2127,4.639257294429708
8193572,5,B000PW9W3Y,"I trained with the same people in these DVD's and they are legit. Funny how some people criticize the folks out of Cold Steel. How they try to advise to not buy these very informative dvds. Please disregard these ill informed people with misguided opinions. The Cold Steel folks train in one of the most highly advanced Knife and weapon systems in the world. The Filipino Martial Arts. Their Instructors are very well known in the the world of knife/weaponry training. They have used their art in real life situations in law enforcement, military and private security contracts. These dvds should add or compliment your current training in the martial arts in general and Filipino Martial Arts specifically.",1424908800,5,707,5.0

8193575,1,B000PW9W3Y,"I wasted $120 on these worthless DVDs, in which Lynn Thompson merely beats up his sparring partner. He does not instruct the viewer on any techniques. Save your money. As a matter of fact, I quit buying any Cold Steel products many years ago, since they have outsourced their production overseas to China and elsewhere.",1398124800,5,319,4.818181818181818
8193576,4,B000PW9W3Y,"Lynn Thompson is not the most eloquent speaker out there.  Nonetheless, this dvd series does address applicable scenarios and demonstrates just how fast things can go sideways on the street.
Having studied martial arts for the better part of my life, I can vouch for the down and dirty method by which Lynn presents these techniques.  Definitely worth the purchase if blade combat is something you would like to learn about.
You will also be sure to get a laugh out of Lynn's colorful vocabulary and various descriptions!",1358035200,8,521,4.909090909090909
