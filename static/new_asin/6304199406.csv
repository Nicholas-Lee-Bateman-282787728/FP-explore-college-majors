7865352,5,6304199406,"I'm 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions. Do NOT try to ""compare"" it to the Disney series. They're totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more ""meat"" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults.
This particular story arc is unique, very well-done, (and a tear-jerker at a few points), that has you sitting on the edge of your seat much of the time.",1289433600,,735,4.6183206106870225
