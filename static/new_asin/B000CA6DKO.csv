All of the characters developed over time, and some showed us surprising sides, but the laughs were there right away. If you've never watched this, well it's sneaky good and you'll find you're hooked without even noticing it's happening.",1522454400,2,365,5.0
8096511,5,B000CA6DKO,"If you enjoy great writing and acting in believable settings this Canadian TV series is for you. No laugh track and you don't need one-you will provide it yourself. Incredibly entertaining, well written episodes. No sex, drugs, rock and roll in the series. Just great fun watching the events in Dog River.",1260576000,,305,4.884615384615385
8096512,5,B000CA6DKO,"I wish there were 10 more seasons.  This show is the BEST!  Good luck to all the cast, you will surely be missed in this household.",1232496000,,131,4.0
8096513,4,B000CA6DKO,I was a big fan of Northern Exposure in the first half of its run because of its oddly satisfying mesh of characters. They were endearingly weird.  Corner Gas has the same small-town community vibe to it.  I enjoy the mix of characters and the humor.  Try it!,1191110400,,259,4.354166666666667
8096514,5,B000CA6DKO,"Clever, kitschy, and compelling, 'Corner Gas,' Canada's #1 sitcom, is the best thing to come out of the Great White North since Bob & Doug McKenzie.  Centered around a gas station and diner located in the big empty of Saskatchewan, the show features clever, sharp-as-a-tack writing and a talented ensemble cast that manages to deliver good-natured humor without resorting to 'Northern Exposure' like histrionics or the syrupy sweetness of other, less memorable sitcoms.  Though uniquely Canadian, 'Corner Gas' delivers broad appeal to anyone who's ever wondered what life might be like in one of those blink-of-an-eye towns that pass by our car windows as we travel from one place to another.  As the show's theme song says:

You say there's no a lot going on

But let me tell you, man, you're so wrong......",1133222400,9,808,5.0
