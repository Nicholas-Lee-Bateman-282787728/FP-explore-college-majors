8210642,4,B000TSPJFO,"Franka Potente (Run, Lola, Run and the Bourne films) excels as both the mother and daughter in this tense and well-structured film. The moral dilemma of human cloning is explored at a very personal level. The emotional anguish of the cloner and the cloned is brought out exceptionally well. The subtitling is good and doesn't intrude. Cases for and against are well argued throughout the plot: a thoughtful and insightful treatment very realistically portrayed. A useful romantic subplot provides the key to resolution. Well done!",1257292800,2,530,5.247058823529412
