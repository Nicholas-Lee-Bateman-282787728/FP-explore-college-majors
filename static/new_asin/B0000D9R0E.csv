1921880,1,B0000D9R0E,"For one as an art piece this was crap.  On the political level it was racist crap that demonized the Arab world, making all Arabs out to be crazed, antisemitic Islamists.  If anyone knows the history of the hijacking they will know it was carried out by the Palestinian Liberation Front, a split from the PLO which was secular nationalist not Islamist as the movie makes them out to be.  The killing of a wheelchair-bound civillian is a brutal act to be sure but this film uses selective memory when discussing brutality.  It makes no mention of the Israeli bombing of a Tunisian town only a week before the hijacking, and in its flashbacks to the creation of Israel it fails to show how the entire state was founded on driving the Arabs from their homes with the help of imperialist agressors Britain.  The only reason the film shows examples of Zionist attrocities against Palestinians is because it would be exceptionally racist if it didn't.  The movie never makes the connection that these acts of terrorism only exist because of the existence of the racist state of Israel and its continued oppression and genocide of Palestinians.  True justice will only come in a singular, secular state of Palestine where Jews and Arabs can live in peace.",1085270400,12,1248,4.75
1921881,5,B0000D9R0E,"A wonderfully moving and impartial (in spite of what some of the other reviewers have said!) human drama. The film shows how the sorrow of the Palestinians and Israelis flows from generation to generation and always results in personal tragedy. All of the terrorists and hostages are personalized and their fear is made real by superb acting and singing to wonderful music. The artificiality of much opera dissolves in the immediacy of the filming, and the result is very direct and moving.
Very valuable on this CD are the extras: a full rerun of the whole opera with the background comments of the director and lead singers, and a talk with the director and John Adams himself, commenting on this new art form. Superb performances by Maltman and Howard.",1077580800,18,755,4.8604651162790695

1921883,1,B0000D9R0E,"Death of Klinghoffer may or may not be a good opera.  It may or may not inappropriately glorify the Palestinian cause.  But, from this production, we'll never know.
First, it is a film based on the opera, NOT a film of the opera.  Something like one-half of the running time is devoted to videos of imagined (on the part of the director) action while the opera score serves as mere soundtrack.  What this might have looked like on the stage is entirely lost.  Alice Goodman is a subtle poet -- I doubt that she intended her libretto to be illustrated by such ham-handed visuals as this film employs.
Second, and much worse, is the awful background noise that overlays much of the music.  We hear shouting, gunfire, rocks hitting walls, and so on, during much of the time the chorus is singing, and even sometimes when the principals are singing.  On occasion this background noise drowns out the opera itself.  It is absolutely infuriating -- one wants to hear John Adams' music, not Ms. Eurotrash's background chatter.  It looks like the director simply uses this score as throwaway background music for a political film.
This is one of the few opera DVDs that I would not recommend that anyone acquire.  And it's really too bad -- we need more DVD recordings of good modern operas such as those of Adams.",1071878400,34,1306,4.639130434782609
1921884,4,B0000D9R0E,"While not the best opera film, Klinghoffer certainly isn't an ""agitprop.""  Would our New Yorker friend condemn the film as propaganda if it used the more readily acceptable conceit that the Palestinians are the bad guys and the Israelis the guiltless victims?  There are always conventions, especially in our politically correct art and ""intellectual"" worlds, of what is and is not to be conceived of, but the simple human fact remains that, if somebody bulldozed your house and raped your mother and called it Justice, you'd be pissed to.  I am not and would never defend the actions of hijackers, but I am saying that there's another and equally valid side to this story.  There are voices besides the Israelis'.
Besides, the opera at no point forgives or defends the actions of the hijackers.  The opera puts us ill at ease with its HUMANIZATION of the hijackers, which is what art is supposed to do -- put us ill at ease.
Art should bloody the audience, not pamper it.
No, this Klinghoffer isn't the best opera film out there (try Solti's Die Frau ohne Schatten or the Rosenkavalier with von Otter, though these aren't necessarily ""films"") but it isn't propaganda.  Many will be inclined to call it that because it dares to be not just another politically correct rehash that reflects and reinforces popular opinion.  It takes that risk.  We have that to be thankful for.  Still, it must be admitted that Klinghoffer isn't Adams at his best.  The composer's mastery is showcased to much more mysterious and powerful effect with Nixon in China.  Wish that one would come out on DVD.  Guess that makes me a radical right-wing Nixonite!",1070582400,7,1637,4.807142857142857
1921885,5,B0000D9R0E,"Penny Woolcock's edition of THE DEATH OF KLINGHOFFER trims away some of the contemplative music of John Adams.  But you won't feel the loss.  Her cuts, and her camerawork, sharpen the urgency of the story and drive it forward.  Her selection of locations and her excellent direction of the actor-singers enfolded me in the drama and elucidated story-lines that I had not fully appreciated on listening to the box-set CD before.  (The singing itself is very good indeed, as is the acting.)  KLINGHOFFER now, seen through Woolcock's work, beautifully conveys the sorrow of hate -- and how seriously mistaken it is to say to oneself, as the passengers setting out on the Achille Lauro might have done if they gave a thought to the misery of the Middle East, ""Nothing to do with me.""  This DVD makes the tragedy of despair, and of wrongdoing (passed along through generations) by Israelis / Jews and Palestinians against one another, somberly and beautifully clear.",1070236800,16,961,4.937888198757764
1921886,5,B0000D9R0E,"Just this once, I'd like to avoid controversy, eschew politics, pose as a cultural tourist from another galaxy -- or from any other century than the Terrible 20th, the century I would least have chosen for the bulk of my lifetime if I'd had any options -- and evaluate this ""performance"" on strictly technical grounds. You'll find plenty of fierce partisanship in other reviews, by people with greater moral certainty than I can claim, and you will NOT be able to watch/hear this DVD without ""taking sides"" ... or possibly taking both sides, or neither. [If you don't remember the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985, you'd be smart to run a search and get the basic historical event established in your mind. It would be absurd to pretend that this opera/film is not a political statement.]

For starters, this is NOT a film of John Adams's opera ""The Death of Klinghoffer."" It's a film grafted on the music of that opera -- a ""trope"" in musicological terms -- that doesn't attempt to replicate the whole opera as it was staged in Brussels and San Francisco in 1991. I was present for the SF performances. This isn't the same work, though much of the music is revisited. What film director Penny Woodcock has created, in some sort of collaboration with John Adams, is effectively a new genre, an operatic film rather than a filmed opera. It's worth seeing/hearing on that basis alone, as a bold experiment, even if the results distress or disappoint you.

The film is a collage of dramatized violence, actual newsreel footage, and out-of-sequence scenes of happenings during and after the hijacking of the cruise ship. The principal characters - the Captain, First Officer Giordano Bruno, Marilyn Klinghoffer, Leon Klinghoffer himself, and each of the four Palestinian hijackers -- sing their thoughts as arias, as if on stage, while much of the contextual footage is ""underscored"" by choral and orchestral music. The music is very good -- let's be clear about that -- in the unique eclectic modernist/minimalist idiom in which John Adams composes. But the opera upstages itself on film just as it did on stage in its premiere performances. I don't think John Adams expected or intended otherwise. The performers in this film achieve what might seem impossible, that is, being plausible both as singers and as movie actors. They exude a kind of earnest dignity in both tasks that elevates and universalizes the emotional drama. I totally disagree with reviewers who have said that this event, the hijacking and the murder, are beyond the scope of opera; I'd argue that only Opera -- the synthesis of music and theater -- has the power to render the impact of such an event.

That was my thought at the performances in San Francisco, that the goal of this opera was a transcendence of mere Art, mere hoity-toity extravagant entertainment, seeking instead a kind of public catharsis through music, theater, and dance comparable to the cathartic impact of Greek tragedy on the citizens of ancient Athens. And I thought composer Adams and librettist Alice Goodman had come astonishingly close, not yet perfect, in need of editing and focusing, but close to the sort of opera that would mean something more to its audience than a balmy evening's diversion. I foresaw revisions, further rehearsals, additions and cuts before the scheduled performances in Los Angeles....

As it happened, the LA performances were cancelled because of controversy, specifically because the hijackers were depicted with human sympathy, and there has never yet been another staging of the work in the USA. John Adams's other major operas -- the earlier ""Nixon in China"" and the recent ""Doctor Atomic"" -- have also generated political controversy and outrage. Relevance? I like that in an opera.",1297814400,10,3784,4.9637223974763405
1921887,5,B0000D9R0E,"The review by G. P. Padillo says all that I might have, and probably better.

Doubtless due to ""political"" pressure, this wonderful production has been withdrawn from the United States.  That is a great pity, but shows the power of pressure groups.

1921888,5,B0000D9R0E,"This is a riveting production that almost redefines how one can view opera. With the visual boundries between

film, TV and stage blurred (or melded together) the viewer/listener feels an immediate relevance to an event that is within recent history and very much pertinent to world affairs today. Yet, it is still opera. The production is finely performed and convincingly acted with a touch of realism that is unsettling. The only flaw, if there is one, occurs in the sound mix between action and score. Sometimes Adams' music and the fine performers are under balanced. However, this too seems to be part of the plan where the listener feels like a particpant. It's all wonderfully discomforting.",1162512000,4,699,5.025862068965517
1921889,4,B0000D9R0E,"Director Penny Woolcock deserves an immense amount of credit for providing a vibrant, emotionally expansive if not altogether dramatically effective 2003 screen translation of what was likely the last decade's most controversial opera. What began as an elaborate oratorio in 1991 was renowned composer John Adams' highly emotional ""The Death of Klinghoffer"", a controversial work with even greater political and emotional resonance post-9/11. The story concerns itself with the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by members of the Palestinian Liberation Front. It is related in a series of arias and recitatives by critical participants in the situation - the ship's captain and first officer; the four terrorists; and key passengers who were held captive over three days, in particular, the Klinghoffers who were celebrating their 36th wedding anniversary.

Adams' familiar post-minimalist music turns out to be surprisingly compatible with the true-life story, as the propulsive vocal parts blend well with Alice Goodman's politically charged libretto. Sung off-screen to vivid montages, the beautiful choruses provide effective bridges and a broader context to the immediate drama of the opera, an aspect that was likely left quite abstract when sung onstage. The other powerful dimension Woolcock brings to this adaptation is the use of real locations and archived footage to make relevant the opera's overall abstraction to the viewer. This is a brave move since the political situation suddenly becomes actualized with the film. As it turns out, it is a dramatically smart move given that Woolcock has a strong cinematic sense of the story, for instance, she apparently cut twenty minutes of the music to make the story flow better, repositions powerful solo arias to enhance the characters' interactions, and adds often traumatizing historical footage and faux-news reports to give the story even greater realism. Solely from that standpoint, this may be the best screen adaptation of a major opera I have ever seen.

The biggest challenge of this production, however, is Goodman's libretto, which seems intent on supporting both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For instance, the opera takes the bold step of putting Israelis and Nazis on the same plain by comparing images of a post-Holocaust concentration camp with those of a mass grave from the 1982 slaughter at the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps. In making such an exerted effort to share the motivation of the terrorists as well as the suffering of the crew and passengers, the drama becomes somewhat diluted by the multiple perspectives. By contrast, look at Paul Greengrass' recent ""United 93"" for a successful example of shifting varying viewpoints without losing the overall dramatic momentum. Some contend that the opera takes discernible political sides, though I think it's a mistake to brand the work as purely pro-Palestinian since the Klinghoffers are portrayed sympathetically if rather one-dimensionally as people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. In particular, the execution of husband Leon, paralyzed from a stroke and wheelchair-bound, is shown shockingly as the act of a thug more than that of a political terrorist.

Fortunately, Woolcock has recruited world-class singers who are able to tone down their singing for the cameras. The standouts are baritone Christopher Maltman as the conflicted captain; fellow baritone Leigh Melrose, who makes the macho posturing of the aptly named terrorist, ""Rambo"", feel palpable; and in the film's only comic moment, soprano Kirsten Blas, who makes her cowering showgirl a convincing media whore. Surprisingly, the Klinghoffers are not given arias to sing until near the end, but mezzo-soprano Yvonne Howard is dynamic as Marilyn especially as she confronts the captain. Baritone Sanford Sylvan, a familiar Adams regular who played Chou En-Lai in ""Nixon in China"", has one powerful aria sung as a voiceover to an extended, haunting image of his dead body sinking deeper into the ocean. In another interesting voiceover done to accommodate the original opera's doubling of roles, a non-singing actor, Emil Marwa, plays the most vulnerable terrorist, Omar, while mezzo Susan Bickley sings his inner thoughts. The 2003 DVD has a surprising number of extras for an opera production, including a commentary track from Woolcock and various cast members. The best extra is an interesting making-of documentary, ""Filming `The Death of Klinghoffer'"", which includes tandem interviews with Adams and Woolcock and goes into the major aspects of putting the challenging production together.",1152576000,11,4635,5.443671766342142
1921890,3,B0000D9R0E,"In the original opera, Adams and Goodman walked the fine line pretty well.  Goodman, being part of the ""NY Elite"" couldn't help but try to equate the plight of the Palestinians to that of the Jews, which is an absurd apples and oranges comparison, but she definitely held back and because of that, the opera is still enjoyable, even as one wishes for perhaps a bit more history.

The film makes no such attempt--quite the opposite--and thus tips over the line, presenting the situations as if they are mirror-images.

Technically, the film is competent, and the adaptation of Adams music is superb.  But as a political statement--which it is, despite hand-waving about ""presenting both sides""--it is distorted and thus fails.",1146268800,5,725,5.016666666666667
1921891,1,B0000D9R0E,"Given the overwhelming complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you really need to approach the Adams-Goodman opera here with complete ignorance as most do. Opera requires ignorance as an integral component for you to understand it,for it simply encourages it as you move through the work. You will not learn much about any conflict,(certainly modern ones) or any historical subject or place from experiencing an opera, for opera its genre has the the habit of clouding,and misleading the listener into its cloistered conservative content. Take any of oper's Greatest Hits and you will find the power exists actually when subjects are dealt with at a distance as in Mozart(Happy Birthday Wolfgang)where his operas basically say ""can we live together. . ."" I guess that is impossible in the Middle East,and inner city metropolis. Shakespeare also dealt with historical subjects but the power he saw in dramatic stagecraft ultimatly resides in the distanced projections of it, as in Macbeth or Hamlet,not really dealing with the political consequences of real names, dates,and places,He saw that historical subjects can have myths built around/into themselves further clouding their content; tyranny on the stage is simply that and further simplified in the process,corruption, greed, and resulting poverty are simply that the result of some power enforcing itself on innocents. Likewise you will not learn anything about neither Nixon,China or Mao in Adams ""Nixon in China"". And so Adams-Goodman collaboration have this conceit then that this work can shed some What? emotive light?, can make people have more compassion for each other?, (Marilyn Klinghoffer is going to see the conflict differently now?), that political players can see the error of their ways? with Klinghoffer here was he the victim of the Palestinians or indirectly of Israel's militaristic approach to solving their problems of occupation and security? One will never know. Opera unfortunately also needs victims and evil-doers, so here the evil-doers are given voice, and I suppose the four teenagers who seized the Achille Lauro who were part of the Palestine Liberation Front,( a splinter group from the PLO run by Mohamed Zeidan(Abdul Abbas)) represents the cause for Palestine?, they are the representatives? Nothing could be further from the truth, but this is Opera,so evil is best portrayed when it is mindless,sacrificial an end unto-itself, so who cares, you buy your ticket and you are simply(in this work)are given the typical ""mantra"" of prejudiced one-sided views found elsewhere in the media- cultural behemoths. I have a problem with choosing political subjects and music or art. The genre in art chosen must give voice to the complexity of the subject,also render sone element of clarity to the subject matter,otherwise you do both a monstrous disservice. Take Picasso's ""Guernica"" as a metaphor where there the entire history of art is summoned to portray an atrocity, the wounded soldier with a fixed gaze clutching his sword, the ""Pieta"",mother weeping holding her dead child, the Angel of Illumination or Darkness,or take Peter Eisenman's massive sculptur in Berlin to the victims of the Holocaust,it is as close one can get to experiencing the ""void"", the opaque loneness of the human spirit or Fernando Botero's series of paintings on the Abu Gharib prison. I think in relation,in comparison you see how shallow,mediocre and vacuous art/opera can be when the concept and musical stagecraft does not come to deal with the complexity of the subject. Opera and this film version is the wrong genre for this subject.",1138579200,5,3613,5.307155322862129

1921893,5,B0000D9R0E,"I just finished watching Penny Woolcock's film of John Adams' ""The Death of Klinghoffer"" and am trying to find energy and calm while writing this and wiping away two hours of tears. The hype surrounding the film was not false, this is a piece which is nothing less than devastating. Although I'm somewhat familiar with the original recording of the opera, this is my first experience ""seeing"" it - understanding that this is different than any stage version could possibly be. It is indeed difficult to watch and I watched the majority of it through tears and shaking my head. The balancing is clear and it is not difficult to have genuine feelings of sadness for the plight of the Palestinians while at the same time recoiling in horror at the actions they choose.

Sanford Sylvan is staggeringly good, creating a character of likeable sensitivity, warmth and strength even an hour before he sings a note. And that smile Marilyn sings about really could light up a room. Sylvan's portrayal is so ""there"" he made me wish I'd known this man. An example of this occurs (while still silent) in the first moments of the hijacking, Leon cradles and tries to protect and comfort his wife but the tears in his eyes she cannot see give off a myriad of emotions - helpless impotence to control the situation, fear and what else I can only imagine. The scene of his brutal, incomprehensible murder is chilling more than words can describe. At least my words. His ""floating"" aria provides a calming effect that is at once eerily beautiful yet disturbing to watch. (Woolcott stated the underwater cameramen were amazed at Sylvan's remarkable breath control allowing him to stay underwater for minutes at a time, eyes wide open).

Yvonne Howard's Marilyn simply breaks the heart, her final aria nearly unbearable in its poignancy. I can't understand the criticisms levelled at the scene before her husband's death where she's prattling on about pain, and idle chatter. She doesn't believe her husband is in any grave danger and she's doing what many of we humans typically do . . . chatter about things not terribly important - anything to take our minds off the horror of the situation at hand. How does one not get that? Very high marks to Ms. Howard.

One of the passengers on board sums up the unbelievability of such situations ""Horrible . . . horrible, to see one's fellow men become like beasts"" In an all too human moment, one of her next lines expresses her embarrassment as she thinks ""At least we're not Jews.""

Like Mr. Sylvan, Christopher Maltman as the Captain exhibits a natural ease in front of the camera, even in his gut wrenching role worried about the fate of his passengers. Another extraordinary performance.

I know this opera continues to be controversial sparking harsh criticism and intolerance, which I find ironic since the heart of the work is about intolerance and the inhumanity we perpetuate upon one other as a result. I've discussed with many chosing to separate themselves from the terrorists but I cannot help but feel that even these most horrible of men are our brothers, we are from the same planet, the same family of man. We humans do terrible things to each other, even to those we purport to love, burying our heads in the sand does nothing to assist in helping resolve that which seems unresolvable. I know I sound hopelessly naive, but I've always had a faith that we won't blow ourselves up, despite what I see around us every day. Adam's opera and Woolcock's film is but a microcosm of that which is far greater than what we see and hear on screen.

Technically, the film is unique, the singers actually singing live on location not lipsynching. This gives a unique, credible quality to the film (and lets you stop worrying about synchronization for once in an opera film). The only non-live singing performance is that of Omar, sung by mezzo, Susan Bickley rather than using a countertenor. His great aria of longing to depart the earth still gives me chills.

This thing will stay with me for a while. I can't recommend highly enough viewing this unique, disturbingly powerful work. Many who have not experienced Klinghoffer, have complained about its being pro-Palestinian. This is something I never feel. The contempt I felt for these terrorists especially Rambo who was not the one to shoot Klinghoffer, is palpable from the way the characters are drawn. Others have stated the work is an insult to the Klinghoffer family - something I don't believe anyone who knows the work can state honestly painting, as it does a picture of a strong, deeply likeable man who's death is nothing less than an atrocity.

I can only agree with the critic at Jewish Film who with both eyes open wrote:

""... the creators were denounced as unabashedly pro-Palestinian for humanizing the terrorists. In actual fact, the libretto gives voice to heartbreaking sufferings by both Israelis and Palestinians. A decade later, in the wake of unrelenting Middle East conflict, many see the oepra's passionate exploration of terrorism from all viewpoints as more important than ever in stimulating dialogue about an intractable situation . . . no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, The Death of Klinghoffer will elicit heated discussion - - and quite possibly, tears.""

I urge others to experience this overwhelming achievement for themselves. I can't see how this opera can fail to move anyone who watches this.",1105660800,68,5437,4.842841765339074
1921894,1,B0000D9R0E,"Is this art, propaganda, both, or neither?

It's propaganda.

It accepts as a fact that rich and greedy Jews stole from poor but noble Arabs and continue to oppress Arabs so much that criminal acts against the Jews are a logical consequence.  However, the actual history of the region has been quite the opposite of all this.

Neither side is presented fairly.

Now, does a work of art have to have anything to do with truth or fairness?  No.  But right now, the most significant attack on human rights by the international community is against the rights of Israeli Jews.  That makes this work a serious element of propaganda in favor of more violence in the region.

Some may say that this work has been heavily criticized by people on all sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  But that certainly does not mean that it is any good!",1105228800,13,832,4.598639455782313
1921895,5,B0000D9R0E,"For my money, Adam's political balance in the opera is just right - as evidenced by the controversy and outrage on both sides represented.
The film opens with the two 'overtures' of equal length - the chorus of exiled Palestinians and the chorus of exiled Jews (sung perfectly by the LSO chorus). The former is accompanied by haunting footage of the Palestinians being driven from their homes in 1948 to make room for the incoming ex-European Jews. The latter plays over equally haunting holocaust footage. The stage is set, and numerous visual links are created between that introduction and later parts of the opera.
I thought Adams' harmonies were compelling and his music has a sense of direction and fragments of melody that belie the 'minimalist' tag he is often lumped with. Christopher Maltman is worthy of special note as a splendid baritone - I'm sure he makes a wonderful lieder singer.
This is cinematic opera - not an opera recording - and as such I think it works very well. I was left with no prejudice against either the Arabs or the Jews - more overwhelming sadness and frustration as it brings home something of the depths of the problem. Everyone has been hurt so badly, and the problems have been etched into history so profoundly, how can justice truly be served from here? Claims abound, but genuinely satisfactory solutions do not.
A sobering, prophetic film that takes on so many deeper layers of meaning in the light of September 11, 2001. According to the booklet, a performance of the choruses was scheduled in Boston in late 2001 and were cancelled because of sensitivities arising from 9/11. A real shame - perhaps there could scarcely have been a more appropriate reflection for us in the West at that time.

Some passages are cut off, like the Ocean and the Desert Choruses, and the Hagar Chorus has been replaced by some TV presentation that is not in the line of the original opera since it introduces Isaac in a chorus  which is not a chorus anymore  that was exclusively centered on Hagar and Ishmael. This does not balance the tale. This betrays the tale as we are going to see. The worst adaptation/distortion is the use of plain spoken words and sentences instead of the sung equivalent. These sections that are no longer sung are just not in the line of the opera which was sung from beginning to end, even if with some sections sounding more like a dirge with a recitative feel, but it was entirely sung.

The second remark is that to add pictures to the music, pictures that are not the direct stage work of the singers, makes the film very difficult to understand. A film of that type is visual first of all and since we are visual dominant we see these added images first and they dominate the rest, the music, the words and the real setting. The film is thus overloaded with news reels about the Shoah, the deportation and extermination of Jews by the Nazis; with visions of the Jews arriving in Palestine and hunting the Palestinians out and banishing them brutally out of their villages and houses that are taken over buy the thousands of arriving Jews in their mass exodus to the Israel of the old times, and in such scene of appropriation of what is not theirs, of homes that belonged to other families the sex sequence in the bed of those expelled Palestinians of a survivor of a Nazi death camp identified by his number on his arm and the whipping scars on his back is a real mental crime against the Palestinians and against the Jews, a desecration of this bed and house. The Jews were captured by the Nazis, extracted from their homes that were looted by any one who wanted to and by the SS and Gestapo for the enrichment of the Reich, and then they were deported to camps where they were supposed to die and it is clearly shown to us in the film. And here we have the vision of exactly the same thing done to the Palestinians by people who had suffered the Nazi persecutions. It looks like a compensation for the evil they had suffered. This is strongly accusatory towards these Zionist Jews. I was stolen my purse yesterday by a punk. So today I steal the purse of the first person I meet in the street. An eye for an eye, but on a third party collateral victim.

The text contains clear mentions of such facts, partcuularly in the prologue, but the images multiply the impact of ,these words, and whats more these images do not intervene only then but do intervene in other places in the opera, hence repetitively. The director of the film knows perfectly well that repetition is subliminal.

In the same way the very graphic images of the expulsion of the Palestinians, of the colonial control and exploitation of the Palestinians, of the horrific life and also death of the Palestinians in the various refugee camps that we can imagine are Sabra and Shatila give the other side of this arrival of the Jews in Palestine based on the Balfour declaration that suggested the parting of Palestine to give a section of this region to the Jews to create a state of their own,. The worst part of this image accompaniment of the text is that the images are often in contradiction with the text. When the Jewish lot is evoked by the text it is illustrated with graphic images of the Palestinian fate, and vice versa. This gives to the Jewish suffering before, in Europe, in the hands of the Europeans, a weight and value that is a lot more important than what it was in the original opera. At the same time the similar providing of graphic images of the suffering of the Palestinians at the hands of the Jews in Palestine emphasizes this suffering that had been kept under control in the libretto. It then becomes completely wild and, particularly at the end the imagined meeting of the terrorists in Gaza in 2003, one in a chauffeured car and two reduced to practically disjointed and ineffective retarded people, does not show much except that their future can be good or bad but always locked up in a surrounding misery that makes this fate totally surreal. In other words we are far from the original opera.

But I want to insist on the cutting of the two choruses: the Ocean Chorus and the Desert Chorus. The first one was going back to the very genesis of humanity in the primeval water expanse in total darkness before creation, the creation  of Adam and Eve, of one source for humanity that is then constantly shown in the opera as divided in two as a decision of God himself who seems to have wanted a dual or bipolar world that is easier to control. Originally the whole humanity was one and that was the vision of the opera modulated later by the Hagar Chorus into two and yet centered only on one: Hagar and the Arabs. Yet thanks to the Hagar Chorus and its being replaced by a news report or news commentary on some TV set on the ship in front of the passengers and the hijackers explaining the two sons and the fate of Hagar and her son banished as soon as Abrahams wife was able to bear a child in her old age, te whole shebang is purely flown into smoke. They even go as far as recalling the fact that the slave Hagar was given to Abraham by his wife because she could not bear children. And the two sons are only presented as the founders of two religions. The original opera only insists on Hagar, on Gods project concerning her son, to create another religion, and the cruel decision of Abraham banishing her and her child, just like the arriving Jews banished the Palestinians from Palestine. In the film the Hagar distorted tale is there to call for love between the two communities in the name of the fact they are cousins. The meaning of the Hagar Chorus has thus been changed completely and that is a shame.

The absence of the Desert Chorus is also regrettable. It explained how the Palestinians lived in the desert, from the desert, entirely formatted and constructed by, for and from the desert with an enormous contrast then with the Day Chorus when the country is showed as cultivated from the top of the mountain to the bank of the river and how a veiled woman has been pushed underground and is going to be drowned into cement and other debris. The veiled woman is the Palestinians and the presently cultivated wasteland of old is Israel. The original opera is showing how Israel has buried the Palestinians under their rich agriculture. We have lost that, that vision of a rich country built and constructed on the banished and hidden previous occupying people that haunts the land. The film preferred graphic images of the 2003 present which has nothing to do with the original opera and is totally anachronistic and  that is the worst part  it changes the ideological and political meaning of the opera.

We could multiply examples like the opening scene with Mrs. Klinghoffer confronted to the four arrested hijackers and spitting in the face of one of them is vain, narrow-minded and it shows the extreme hatred that Jewish woman can nourish in her heart, if she has a heart. This opening scene is going to be amplified by the closing scene when she is officially announced the death of her husband by the captain and her first reaction is a destructive rage nearly including the captain in itself. Her pain is thus translated into hatred and violence against objects and people who have nothing to do with her own fate in spite of her accusation that the Captain had been on the side of the hijackers, which was not the case as we have seen all along. They were hostages just as much as anyone else. Then she cools down a little bit and she comes to that strange concluding image that she is pregnant with her dead husband who will not be redeemed by God as long as she is alive. In other words she takes her husband hostage for the rest of her life. Instead of having the Jewish understanding that the dead husband cannot be redeemed by God as long as he is not reunited with his wife to whom he is eternally committed, we have a mean woman getting even with fate by taking her husband hostage against Gods redemption. How much does she hate him at this moment!

To remain on these two, before dying Mr. Klinghoffer is able to meet his wife, or his wife is authorized to rejoin her husband for the second part of his soliloquy during which she has nothing to say since originally she did not join him then. What is for him in the original opera a soothing recollection of the past becomes then by being addressed to the wife present in the film a sort of solace for the wife and no longer for the husband. He is trying to make it easier for her to survive instead of making it easier for himself to die.

Such transformation makes the film very messy and even fuzzy on the ideological meaning. It is in 2003 literally embedded in the War on Terror raging at the time and John Adams is conducting, which means he accepted such a drift from the original and a lot more cautious and discreet opera, which made it a lot more humane.

8000401,5,B0000D9R0E,"The story of this contemporary (the composer is still alive) opera is based upon a true incident that occurred off the coast of Somalia in the early 1990s  This particular opera was produced in London in 1992 and was scheduled to be a 2014 Metropolitan Opera pick for its operas to be shown in movie houses in major US cities;  but a misguided, in my opinion, outcry from individual Jews,  mainly in New York City,  and several prominent national Jewish Organizations objected, claiming that the production favored the cause of Arabs in the Arab-Israel conflict over the years..  Klinghoffer was a Jewish passenger on the tourist vessel.  He was drowned by the pirates,  who invaded the ship.  The subject matter was made into a very successful movie with Tom Hanks in about 2011.

I do not find the movie biased in one direction or the other.  The Arab pirates are justly criticized for their barbarity in dealing with the passengers, both Jewish and non-Jewish.  I recommend that the opera be seen far and wide.  I say this as a Jew.

It's possible that film is the best way to deal with the static nature of the story. Director Woolcock intersperses film (yes, I know you can do this in the opera house as well) to support the libretto when the libretto doesn't demand particular visuals. Even more effective are the use of close-ups, in particular of Mrs. Klinghoffer (Yvonne Howard), who is quite good. The stage would require over-the-top gestures, which would be all wrong here.

The highlight for me is, of all things, the Dancing British Girl (""He kept us in ciggies all day""). Alice Goodman gets picked on for a poor libretto, but this part is brilliant. The girl is portrayed as immature and overly fond of the media attention. But she's also given a few lines of insight about the Americans ""were sure they knew their rights"" and didn't realize that this is war.

As far as the politics of it, I think it's meant to be open, which isn't the same as trying to convince me that both sides are equal. I can decide myself what to think, which in this case meant usually wishing the hijackers would get their comeuppance. The fact that they are portrayed as having motives isn't wrong. Nor is the fact that one is portrayed as a nice guy (this is actually a movie cliche). And Mrs. K is given the last word.",1401235200,2,1497,4.358422939068101
8000404,5,B0000D9R0E,"I am frankly amazed at the animosity of some of the reviews.  I happen to think Adams is the foremost American opera composer of this new century.  I had read about the controversy surrounding this opera, which led to its being effectively banned from American operatic stages, so I was ready to pass judgment, but instead I have become an ardent supporter of both the work and its message.  It does state something we all know but no one, given the strength of the Israel lobby both in American arts and government, dares to say. Therefore, it has become ENTARTETE MUSIK.  The combination of film and opera has never been more successful than in this production.  I love it also for the passions it generates, the trademark of all great art.  Kudos to all involved.

An update: this opera is on the Met's roster for next season.  But it will not be appearing in movie houses all over the world.  GUESS who objected.  It has become indeed forbidden art.  Only the 1% who can afford the Met will be able to see it.  BUY THE DVD!",1384646400,2,1027,4.462365591397849
