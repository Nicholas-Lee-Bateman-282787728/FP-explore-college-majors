1730384,3,B00006953K,"THIS MOVIE IS SO WELL DONE AND PERFORMED ....it really feels and seems like something ordinary, everyday, and real (AND YOU'LL HAVE SOME ANGST OVER THAT FACT ) because it seems upclose and personal to your life.  You do have to remind yourself that you are watching a movie and it is not your story.  (Doesn't matter if some of the script goes off to something that seems to lead away: those instances are what makes the movie seem real, near to all of us...soon you will have that feeling again that you know this story or you feel this story like you know it....something about it.)

Now it is really slow for an affect.  But you won't mind.  There is something you want done and for petesake you want it done because you have fallen in love with their son...such a good young guy trying to be a man and that should have been honored.
Then.  It comes to be: What is there to do?  GOD, what is there to do?  (And it's like ALL OF US...we're in this with him, What is there to do?!)
Your soul really cries out to you to make that decision.  You were rid of it even-well when you went to court with them to see things through.
Him and his wife.  You were well  with them sitting in that court room with hope and justice in everybody's heart.

THIS MOVIE WILL LIVE WITHIN YOU.  (*BUT....I still don't know why the title is: IN THE BEDROOM.)

1730474,4,B00006953K,"In a charming, scenic, somewhat sleepy Maine town, where lobster fishermen set their traps, and a romance appears to be in full bloom, some bad stuff is about to happen. The pair is Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl), a smart college student and an older Natalie (Marisa Tomei), not yet divorced from her abusive husband. And we shouldn't be surprised when events turn sour, because an early reference is to ""the bedroom,""which, in lobster fishing parlance, is a space in the trap from which a lobster cannot back out and if 2 become trapped there, they will do great harm to each other. This is a well directed (Tod Field), edited, cast, and filmed production . Sissy Spacek (Ruth Fowler) and Tom Wilkinson (Matt Fowler) do stellar jobs as the parents of Frank and as a couple whose strengths and foibles will be revealed in a variety of ways. Marissa Tomei (Natalie) is  excellent as ever. The music really works. Some very fine choral work with Ruth, Spacek's character , serving as the high school choir director, provides extra dimension and depth to the storyline. The cinematography is first rate. Silences are prominent in this film; they are wonderfully appropriate and go far to enhance the weightiness of the story and build expectancy and intrigue.  The role of the sounds of summer baseball are wisely inserted, creating the semblance of calm and normalcy in contrast and counterpoint to the anything but ordinary action.  A smart film with exceptional performances!",1469491200,,1470,4.919354838709677

1730524,5,B00006953K,"What a wonderfully thoughtful movie. Anyone who has endured, or is enduring a tragic loss will easily relate to the emotionally complex actions and reactions of the characters in this film. Such a genuine portrayal of parents coping with the loss of a child could not have been better played out than the actors. This film is honest, raw, tender, moving and engaging.
The film may seem slow to some, but the tone of the movie is of parents in the aftermath of the death of a child. That process is slow, the decisions made during that first weeks and months after such and event can not be placed in logical sequence, people that love each other deeply can and will lash out at one another. This film captures that pace, beautifully.
This is a solid piece of work that is a truthful portrayal of humanity. I watched it a few years ago and liked it, I watched it tonight one week before the five month mark of the sudden and unexpected death of my 23 year old son, it is as if I am seeing this film for the first time.

1730548,5,B00006953K,"I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times now.  The first time was in a run-down indie theater still utilizing late 80's tech and boding a center aisle with all seats sitting level with the ones front- and aft ward.  I was already guaranteed a joyless viewing experience yet it was made even worse by the fact that I was 15 and in the company of my then boyfriend and is his terrifying mother.  I couldn't not but hate it.

Unable to understand (or at least empathize with) the subject matter, I thought it a dull and mostly uneventful film.  I know better now.

On the surface,  it feels lifeless and about as evocative as a still life painting of a fruit basket.  Yet, watching it again several years ago and every year since then, I am always left emotionally destroyed.

 I can't help but become enrapt with the  heartache, hopelessness, and pain made so tangible by Spacek, Wilkinson, and Tomei.  The performances and nuance are so real this movie feels closer to a documentary then it does a drama.  It is made even more realistic by the absence of music (save for beautiful sounds of the choir).

There is something to be said for a movie that doesn't need to rely on cheap tricks and Thomas Newman scores in order to elicit emotion in its audience.  Add to that the fact that Tomei's on screen ex doesn't even need to make overt physical and verbal threats in order to chill and terrify me as they sit seemingly placid at the table.  And that the movie can end with Spacek and Wilkinson barely saying a word as they lie in bed, yet revealing through the most subtle of gestures that peace has forever left one partner while it's reclaimed by the other.",1453939200,,1667,4.434210526315789

At the beginning Marisa Tomei and the young man's relationship was really interesting. And the fact that the young man died of the gun shot by  Marisa Tomei's 'going to be divorced husband' is very involving and not predictable,
Then from that on, the story is quit obvious. But I still made me expecting something. Vengence perhaps from the young man's parents. Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek, perhaps.
But the vengence part was the problem part. It was not powerful enough.
It's like, well, too common.

There is nothing lighthearted or even romantic about it! But it was easily one of the most all consuming movies I have ever watched. I had such emotional investment in the characters that I couldn't look away or pause the movie for a second.

This movie is about grief, relationships, revenge, mental anguish, and how different people cope with horrible tragedy in their lives. The acting was stellar. Sissy Spacek was unlikable for the most part which is due to her amazing acting skills. Tom Wilkinson was absolutely riveting in his role of a easy going, kind hearted dad whose life is turned upside down in an instant. His grief is so deep that he is near crazed while his wife, played by Sissy Spacek, simply shuts down and hides away. I felt William Mapother was the only somewhat weak link but he still did an excellent job especially toward the end of the film.

I don't like to give away plots and spoil things for those, like me, who are not already familiar with the storyline so I won't go into detail about what happened and why the movie is so dark and emotionally tough to watch but it truly was an eye opener for me. At times, the movie seemed to lag a bit and I wanted to something - anything - to happen but that was intentional. The writers were showing how life can drag after a tragedy and how ordinary days can turn into what feels like weeks when there is no end in sight to the terrible grief and injustice one feels inside.

I particularity liked the explosive argument between the two main characters which, in turn, brought them closer together as spouses, Although the end of the movie seemed a bit out there, I was completely sucked in and was so disappointed when it ended. I wanted MORE! i didn't feel like I was done with these people and their situation and I needed more but all I got were the credits. The movie left a big impression on me and left me wondering for days what happened after. I obviously will never know but I do feel this movie is one that anyone could get deeply involved in. It's not funny or light but it's absolutely riveting.",1444953600,,2211,4.38780487804878

I can only ""echo"" the previous reviewers comments regarding the plot, the extreme excellence of ALL of the cast members, most notable, Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson, who I thought portrayed the roles of the grieving parents, perfectly and believable. Sissy Spacek as ""Ruth"" was spot-on as a loving, but very controlling mother, who has a hard time believing that ANY woman her son chooses to date is ""worthy"", but is especially concerned with his current girlfriend, ""Natalie"", played by an excellent Marisa Tomei. Personally, the way the story unfolds completely brought me into it, made me care very much about the family it revolved around. I believe that the actors, the director and the cinematographer were ALL at their best in this tragic story. Tom Wilkinson, as the patriarch of the family is exceptional! He is able to convey his emotions with no more than a facial expression,or a gesture or even just in the quiet strength one feels from this man who is devastated about not only the loss of his son, but at the circumstances that are ""pushed"" upon all of them, after ""Frank's"" (the son) death.

It's a view of grief in the everyday form that most people experience -- it's about the grinding, day-to-day. long haul of loss from which everyone tries to escape via destruction and self-destruction.  If you have no personal experience with grief, the film will make no sense.  If you are still grieving, it will hit too close to home.

1730773,2,B00006953K,"Keep loving Sissy Spacek. Avoid this film.

So vacantly brooding and plodding is it, that it is often hard to bear. I was lucky: I rented it on DVD, affording me the opportunity to fast-forward, thus giving me the privilege of leaping past the stuttering dialogical and dialectical stiffness of the movie. The movie mistakes--pretentiously--hesitation for contemplative, dramatic effect. None of the characters can seem to get to a salient point in due time in order to solidify viewer engagement, or in order to move the plot along apace--a requirement of all good movies. To wit: Has any movie encased a major character with so intelligent a character title, i.e. ""doctor,"" as Tom Wilkinson's character (Matt) has herein, yet have that character be so frustratingly verbally dawdling throughout? That is, so reluctant to say what is? Further, so weak-willed (until Sissy Spacek lights a fire under him in one of the last two or three scenes of the film)? If so, spare me that film, as well. Moreover, I may never watch a Marisa Tomei film again. In ""In The Bedroom,"" she plays the small-town semi-floozy. Give Ms. Tomei credit for being a real-life product the wonderful city of Brooklyn, NY, but in this forgettable flick (outdated term I know), whatever warped take-off on an east coast accent she used was simply unlistenable and nauseating. (One wishes her real-life mother would jump into the film and renew with Ms. Tomei speech corrective lessons.) Ugh! My goodness! But I guess it--the accent--intersected the myopia and untutored aspect of Ms. Tomei's character. But strike ""intersect."" Insert ""ruined."" Ms. Tomei, like Mr. Wilkinson, was so afflicted with the disease of empty hesitancy in speech, that when Natalie, played by Ms. Tomei, testifies in the crucial courtroom scene surrounding the murder of Frank, Natalie's lover, she can only ball and weep. And, of course, profile disinclination (hesitancy). ""Disincline"" might be a catchword for this (lack of) motion picture. Natalie is disinclined to own up to Frank's parents disapproval of her relationship with their younger son. Matt is disinclined to probe his son's consciousness of choice in women. Even Ruth, played by Ms. Spacek, is disinclined to criticize her weak-willed husband Matt until they are down to their last recourse for justice. Only the bad guy, Richard, is sizzling with direct action. Hmmm: Only the bad guy is resolute, fluent, and self-committing, while the good guys drown in weary bathos.

1730774,4,B00006953K,"In The Bedroom delivers on several levels, but most brilliantly in the performances of Tom Wlikinson and Marissa Tomei. Wilkinson plays a doctor whose college bound son has fallen for single mom Tomei. Tomei's husband, who she kicked out a while back, doesn't take the affair well. One thing leads to another with disastrous results for Wilkinson's son. The lead up to the tragedy is well done, if a bit drawn out. From there we are treated to some plodding set pieces that do well to express the grief of Wilkinson's character as well as that of his wife as we build toward a fateful moment that can be seen coming from miles away. Nonetheless, this movie digs deep into the heart for both love and loss, a difficult task in modern cinema. Thanks to Wlkinson, who practically carries the entire movie, the film gets us through the best and worst. And Tomei also turns in a great performance even though she is a bit underutilized. I would have like to have seen more of her on the screen. After all, her character and the son are the reason this whole thing blew up. Otherwise, I would have given it five full stars.

1730818,4,B00006953K,"I don't understand all the negative reviews of this movie.  It's one of my favorites, because of its understated power, the haunting music and story, and how it stays with you.  Those who say it's ""boring"" or had trouble sitting through it obviously are not mature enough to watch something like that, who expect constant ""action"" and who have short attention spans.  The story, about a couple whose only son is killed, follows them as they grieve (albeit differently), maneuver through the criminal justice system, and ultimately make a decision which will further impact them the rest of their lives.

It's done sensitively and in an emotionally wrenching way, with supurb performances from all cast.  Key to the story, and the reason for the title, is the symbolism of the lobster industry, as the story takes place in Maine.  The phrase ""in the bedroom"" refers to the part of a lobster trap in which, if there are more than two lobsters in there, can cause the others to be injured or killed.  The symbolism continues in the beginning of the movie, in which the dad describes an older, female lobster (carrying ""berries"" or young) as aggressive and, in his words, ""can take out two males easy.""  This becomes important, as you see in the story, in that the mother harbors tremendous bitterness, wanting to avenge her son's death, and is instrumental in convincing her husband, ultimately, to make a decision that may prove to be the couple's undoing.  The haunting score of the movie is a perfect complement to a haunting, disturbing tale.",1304208000,,1543,4.836501901140684

Nick Stahl plays their only son, Frank, who is preparing for graduate school and would still look at place in high school.

Natalie is noticeably older than Frank and comes not only with two young boys, but also the baggage of Richard, a belligerent ex-husband played with seething menace by William Mapother, whose work I knew best from television in shows from Lost to CSI.

Ruth wants Frank to concentrate on his education and can hardly restrain her disapproval at his relationship with Natalie.  Her up and coming son doesn't need an attachment to an older divorcee with two children, and the perceptive Ruth understands that her husband likes having juicy Natalie around better than he understands it himself.  Matt knows Ruth is correct - Frank should be concentrating on more permanent things than what appears a summer fling - but he doesn't want to interfere in his grown son's fun, and he thinks Ruth has too often interfered with their son's fun in the past.

A different movie may have focused on the ex-husband and his threats to Natalie and her new young lover.  By instead focusing on the pillar-of-the-community Fowler family it is more jarring when tragedy strikes, and it leaves us more emotionally raw and primed for what happens in the closing act.

In tone I found the first half of the movie similar to Moonlight Mile, with Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Jake Gyllenhaal, but the final sequence of this film enters territory I didn't expect for these characters.  I am not often surprised and entertained by a movie, but ""In The Bedroom"" succeeds on all counts.",1295395200,,2006,4.867647058823529
1730820,3,B00006953K,"With the Academy Awards coming this month, I thought that I would watch some movies that had been nominated for the award in the past few years. While most people are familiar with past winners, few remember those that were nominated but did not win. Therefore, I started with In the Bedroom which was released in 2001 and was nominated for five academy awards including best picture, best actor, best actress, and best supporting actress. The plot of the movie centers around the Fowler family which is comprised of Frank Fowler, his mother and his father. Frank is a 20 something year old who is spending his last summer at home before going to graduate school. His plans are complicated when he falls in love with an older woman who has two children and an extremely abusive husband from whom she is separated. For the first half of the movie, Frank struggles with his decision to go to college and believes that he may defer his enrollment for another year in order to spend more time with his new love. Frank's parents disagree with his choice and fear that his relationship with his older girlfriend will jeopardize his entire future. When tragedy strikes, the once ""perfect"" family is severed and they must try to find their way back to each other.

The acting in this film is superb and is clearly worthy of its various nominations. The first half of the film was extremely close to perfection. The rising action created such tension between the characters that it spilled out of the TV and made a large pit in my stomach. However, once the film reaches its climax it appears that it has few places to go. Being that it reached its peak early in the film, there is almost an hour in which the two main characters looked at each other with knowing glances and did little else. Yet, the last ten minutes move so quickly that it leaves the viewer wondering why such action was delayed for so long! Overall, the acting is great, the plot is certainly intriguing, but the pacing makes the movie seem lacking and not well thought out.",1274313600,,2036,4.593406593406593

Starring Oscar winners Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei, this critically acclamied feature deals with the love affair between a young 21 year old man and an older woman who has two children and is newly separated from an abusive, violent spouse. The film deals with how the parents of the young man disagree with this relationship, not because they are prejudiced with their son's dating an older woman, but because they worry about their child's safety with a mentally unbalanced ex husband lurking around. The plot goes into overdrive when something unfortunate happens as the characters become immersed with each other leaving the viewer speechless. The script and performances are flawless, especially by Spacek who plays the mother, and ""In The Bedroom"" is one of those films that makes the viewer question their own value system and prejudices when it comes to love that may be questionable at times.

1730824,5,B00006953K,"""In the Bedroom"" was nominated for best picture in 2002 and is clearly one of the best films of the decade. It is a gut wrenching, thought provoking, artistic masterpiece. The direction is superb. You will have a hard time finding a movie with as many great acting performances as this one (it was no surprise to me that this movie was nominated for three acting Oscars).

However, this is not for everyone. It is pure drama. Almost more a play than a movie. It does not rely on formulas for maximizing market share. No sex scenes. No likable ""goof ball"" injected into the script to lighten things up around the heavy story. Very little action. Very little background music, sometimes nothing at all.....just the dialogue between characters and silence in between. I heard one critic say that the silence itself was a character in this movie. You see warts and flaws in all of the characters.

What this movie does is stay true to the story and characters, making you feel and experience the emotions that the characters are experiencing, and deliberately grinds at a slow pace. And at the end of the movie you understand why the slow pace was necessary. The circumstances are extraordinary, but very plausible and painfully realistic. Too realistic for some.........I am sure some who watch are made a bit uncomfortable to see a reflection of themselves in the flaws of the movies characters.

So if you are interested in a realistic story with great acting, heavy subject matter, and deep conflict, this movie will make you say ""Wow"". But if that is not your bag, you will not find this film very entertaining.

One more point to many of the online critics of ""In the Bedroom"".......they need to think outside themselves and understand there is a difference between a ""bad movie"" and a movie that does not entertain you because it is not the type of movie you enjoy. Look, I like realistic movies (such as ""In the Bedroom"") but I have little interest in fantasies and science fiction. For example, I do not care for any of the Lord of the Rings flicks. However, I acknowledge that these are Oscar worthy movies, that Jackson is a great director, and that Tolkien was a great writer. ""In the Bedroom"" is a great movie. Even if you do not like ""In the Bedroom"", you should respect it as a great work of art.",1261612800,,2307,4.6332518337408315

1730826,5,B00006953K,"""In the Bedroom"" (2002) is a tragedy that takes place amid a beckoning and idyllic Maine landscape. In the small town of Camden the father, Matt Fowler (Tom Wilkinson), is a medical doctor, the mother, Ruth (Sissy Spacek) is a chorus teacher in the local high school.
Apparently the paternal grandfather had been a lobsterman. Matt and Ruth's son, Frank, has taken up lobstering to make extra money, and because it's in the family blood. He's bought a boat and goes out each day to pull in the traps. Lobstering has skipped a generation, but the father still yearns to go out to sea and be part of the family tradition. The son has a promising future in college, and has architectural talents.
Frank has fallen in love with an older woman, Natalie (Marisa Tomei) separated from her abusive husband, not yet divorced, with two young children. Her husband, Richard Strout, is the scion of the Strout Canning Company, apparently the town's main employer. In the small town it's difficult to get away from the past, and the canning company is a constant presence.
In a fateful scene Frank gets killed. Think of it as a classical tragedy: the prince has been killed. The king and queen are grieving, distraught. The death is driving them further and further apart. They grieve deeply over their dead son, but they grieve separately. They cannot join each other in their sorrow because each blames the other for what has happened.
What they say to each other in their big blow-up has truth on both sides. Has the mother been too strict, too much of a controller? At times is she like Lady Macbeth? Has the father been too indulgent? Has he had a tendency to look the other way when it came to the son? Has he been envious of his son? Has he been weak and capable of being manipulated?
The movie carefully reveals the fault lines in the lives of the Fowlers. Viewers will have a difficult time anticipating where the movie is heading, but the director wants viewers to focus on the characters of the father and mother as determinants of the plot's direction. There are no easy answers, only moral dilemmas.
This film has great cinematography and editing. The acting is superb. It's full of a lot of prosaic details that make it very real and believable.

With an intense script and a group of absolutely powerhouse actors at his disposal, the director wisely keeps the direction elegant and subtle.

In fact, I admantly HATED this movie the first time I saw it, however, it kept calling me back and I came to love it. I especially love the end as it vindicates all departed individuals whose murderers sit breathing for life in prisons instead of eye for an eye punishment being meted out.

I'm sure someone has mentioned the fact that the actor William Mapother who plays Richard must be a Tom Cruise cousin. Looks just like him and that is Cruise's actual surname. He did a very adequate job of making us hate him.

I'm not buying it.  Why go against everything you've stood for your whole life by giving into the same impulses?  Doesn't make any sense.

As for the killer, he should have known you NEVER get into a car with anyone with a gun.  You run, shouting Fire!, Fire!.  That's your best bet.  Otherwise, the gunman controls where you go and how you end up.

Add to these Todd Field's ""In The Bedroom"" which I finally saw this week. It's a meticulously constructed, suspenseful film where every line of dialog and shot has significance. It concerns Sissy Spacek (who pulls off a tricky performance that may get her another Oscar), an upper-middle-class woman whose promising college age son becomes involved with a working-class older woman (Marisa Tomei) with a couple of young kids and a glowering soon-to-be ex-husband. There are some surprises to be had, including a screeching big one right in the middle of the movie which I shall not reveal (although many critics ignorantly have.) Suffice it to say that the moral fault (or responsibility) is not where you initially think it is. The film is based on a short story by Andre Dubus, an explicitly Catholic writer. At one point in the film a priest offers a vision of faith as as healing and redemptive force (which is sadly not accepted). The movie is ultimately about the absolute necessity of faith and forgiveness for spiritual survival in the face of the most extreme, murderous human situations.

1730846,5,B00006953K,"`In the Bedroom' is one of those films that is so tragic, so devastating, so emotionally crippling that one is forced to tear themselves down and examine all that they are witnessing.  There are few films that can make the act of buying chocolate tear-inducing, but Todd Field's brilliantly crafted `In the Bedroom' does that very thing.  I have yet to see a film that has touched me the way that this film has, nor have I seen a film that I am this violently passionate about, but `In the Bedroom' is just that rare cinematic accomplishment that gets everything right.  It is not the most devastating story to ever be told, but the way the story is told, the way the events and their effect are delivered to the viewer is so magnificent, so raw and real that the audience quickly becomes so absorbed and invested that they feel the pain as if it were there own.

The film is adapted from Andre Dubus' short story entitled `Killings' (which if you ever have the chance to read please do for it is extremely well written) which follows the aftereffects of a young mans murder on his parents.  While the short story comes in at the funeral and moves forward from there Todd Field masterfully adapted his script to include events taking place before the killing that connect the audience with not only the suffering parents but the victim as well.

Todd Field made Frank Fowler real.

Frank Fowler is a young college student home for the summer.  His summer activities mostly include the older Natalie Strout, a mother who is separated from her violent and jealous husband.  Frank's parents do not necessarily approve of his decision (especially not his mother) but he is a grown man and they really can't prevent him from seeing who he pleases.  The only person that can stop Frank is Frank; that is until Natalie's estranged husband Richard gets wind of the affair and decides to end it himself, with a gun.  This powerful moment (which occurs off-screen) carries the weight of the balance of the film.  Part of what makes Todd Fields direction so dynamic is decisions like the one mentioned above, to have the murder take place out of the line of sight.  In this Field is able to focus, not on the tragedy that befell Frank, but on the hole that it left in those he loved.  The killing is felt throughout the entire film yet it is never seen.

Frank's parents Matt and Ruth deal with the loss of their son in different yet equally emotional ways.  They become distant from one another.  They begin to blame one another, to accuse and turn on one another.  This is expected and has been seen in films of this nature before but Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek are so brilliant here the whole situation takes on new light.  When they verbally assault one another in the living room it's shocking to the viewer and thus it has so much more weight tagged onto its back.  Their eventual struggle to reconnect is even more shocking and that final scene is a disturbing yet settling and warranted conclusion.

The film is shot beautifully, in small vignettes that help the audience connect to the characters and fall into the mood that Todd Field and Andre Dubus before him set before us.  The film, playing more like a collection of scenes, gives the audience a sense of reality.  This is just life depicted in art.  The lives these two live is just like yours and mine except they've lost something very dear to them.

The acting here is some of the finest in recent years.  Each and every performance comes together to establish real and raw emotions that the audience can relate to and sympathize with.  Watching Wilkinson and Spacek interact with one another in mere silence is so emotionally reaching and powerful.  Marisa Tomei is also effortlessly endearing as Natalie.  As the viewer watches her struggle for words, her uncontrollable shakes and shivers as she attempts to give her statement to the court you can't help but become invested in her character, in her pain.  Nick Stahl is effective as the doomed Frank, and he needs to be for this movie hinges on his performance.  William Mapother brings a sense of understanding to his portrayal of Richard, especially as the film spirals to its closing.

No performance though is as essential to the impact of this film as Wilkinson's portrayal of Matt Fowler.  There is one scene in particular that to me is the scene this whole movie can base itself on.  It's a shot of Matt in his son's room rummaging through his things and there are tears falling from his face.  This scene chocked me up so much because his pain was so real, so realistic.  It was not dramatized.  There was no sudden outburst, no screams, nothing but real emotion.

And that to me sums up `In the Bedroom', one of the finest films ever to be filmed.  This is real emotion at play here, a film that elicits in the viewer a deep-seated pain that is so real, so genuine that we can't help but feel a part of it.  This is one of the most effective character studies in recent years and will remain in your mind and in your heart forever.",1196899200,,5056,4.562084257206209

I attended the film because of Marisa Tomei and because of the blanket praise for this film. I still love and worship Marisa, but I didn't find her as interesting as in her other flicks. I have no doubt that it isn't her fault since nothing about this film seemed to go right.

The story had compelling plots points. A sympathetic adultery, a killing, a squabbling older couple in the killing's aftermath, vigilantism. But it was all dulled dulled dulled! The story had no momentum. Or rather, the momentum was killed by dwelling on the mundane and the incidental. The moments relevent to the plot were too isolated to build dramatic tension.

Adapted from Andre Dubus' novel entitled `Killings', `In the Bedroom' delivers a sharp script and excellent acting to give the viewer a complete movie experience.  In the small lobster town of Camden Maine the Fowler family is about to get hit with a brick, a very large painstaking brick.  Matt (Wilkinson) and Ruth (Spacek) are about to lose their only son Frank (Stahl).  When Frank returns from college for the summer he takes up with Natalie (Tomei), a slightly older women with two small boys and a violent estranged husband.  When her husband finds out she's sleeping with Frank he reacts...violently and kills him.

The remainder of the film delves into the feelings each party is left with, most notably the parents, and how this tragedy has ripped them apart and causes them to doubt each other and themselves.  As the trial against Natalie's husband Richard (Mapother) continues to get stretched out, and after he's released on bail, the stress of the whole situation starts to weaken the Fowlers day by day, especially Ruth as she has to contend with seeing her son's killer walking the streets.

This film is really substantiated by the performances by the entire cast, Tom Wilkinson in particular.  His subtlety in delivery is so brilliantly poised that we are given a devastating glimpse into this mans soul without over dramatics.  He elegantly paints a picture of pain and despair without shoving it in our face.  You just want to hold him and tell him it'll be alright...There's one scene in particular that really got to me...that grabbed me by the heartstrings if you will.  After the funeral Matt makes his way up to his son's bedroom and as he's looking through his things you get a glimpse of these tears rolling off his face and its there in that moment, in the bedroom, that this movie reached out to me.

I don't know what more I can say other than the fact that this movie is so much more than entertainment.  It delves into the raw emotions of the people involved and delivers a tragic look at loss and grief and the horrible things we may do in seeking out justice (or merely seeking peace of mind).  While it does move slowly, that's a big part of the power it holds for it's in the slow moving sequences of events where we get to see the effect the murder has had on this family.  I agree with one reviewer who said you'll either love it or hate it.  I loved it and like his girlfriend, my wife fell asleep (to her credit it was really late) but if your not a fan of slow moving melodramas then you may want to skip this one.

Andre Dubus' quality writing delivers us an enchanting an involving relationship between single mother Natalie and young college bound Frank. This relationship is one of the areas in which 'In the Bedroom' succeeds where so many other films have fallen flat on their faces. Here the love between the characters is truly believable and the viewer is drawn into an attachment and identification with them that is uncommon in modern Hollywood movies.

The second, more sombre phase of the film is beautifully rendered and heart breaking. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson deliver wondeful performances that should have had more recognition in terms of awards. Here the film portrays grief and loss with an emotive impact that is rarely seen in cinema.

If you are a viewer who is interested in a film which delivers a vivid depiction of the gamut of human emotion, then 'In the Bedroom' is unmissable.",1143936000,,1126,4.91578947368421

Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt with.

Story takes place in a small town where the Strout family is a big deal.  You know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers.  There is also the Fowler family which also make their way in the town.  She is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son, Frank, that is dating an older woman (Marisa Tomei) and she has 2 sons.  Well, the Strout family's son is married to Marisa Tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren't even divorced yet.  Can't say that I blame him there, but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly.

Moving along, the Strout's son kills Frank and because of the Strout's clout and the fact that the ex wife didn't actually see him fire the shot, he is going to get off with manslaughter.  This does not sit well with the Fowler's.  The Fowler's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land, so you can only imagine what happens.  I certainly don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending.  The Strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail, so since it appeared that he jumped bail, they will lose all of that.  Beautiful!  Then, they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets.  I couldn't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself.

Having viewed the first half of the movie I couldn't imagine the parents hatching such a scheme - let alone carrying it out because they weren't the same people originally presented. The movie changed genres but the characters also changed so the total movie became somewhat suspect.

When the parents had their fight it was cathartic in that they were able to express their grief, move forward, and hopefully heal. Not in this movie. No they hatch a revenge scheme instead.

Isn't having a catharsis and expressing your feelings was supposed to make you a better person?

I know movie makers try to think up new plots, directors try new devices such a mixing genres, different plot twists, etc but this was two seperate movies (one grade A one Grade B) implausibly or illogically sewn together.",1139011200,,1021,4.884393063583815
1730885,4,B00006953K,"IN THE BEDROOM is a film about the parents of a college age son who have to cope with his death and the ways in which the death of their only child changes their lives completely. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are Ruth and Matt Fowler, a teacher and doctor respectively. The two reside in mid-coast Maine and have comfortable lives centered on their son and careers. Frank, their son, played by Nick Stahl, has what he calls a summer fling with Natalie Strout, a divorced mother of two sons played by Marisa Tomei.  Natalie loves Frank's innocence and the role he plays in her son's lives and we do get the sense that something serious may occur. Life changes when Richard Strout, played by William Mapother, returns to town. He claims to want to reunite with Natalie, but the motive stems more from jealousy than anything else. Frank is killed by Richard. The bulk of the film is the aftermath of the death as experienced by Ruth and Matt.

When the film was released, critics applauded the performances of Spacek and Wilkinson, and viewers will see that the accolades are well earned. We do get a sense of the pain the two face, and we feel for them. The on location filming gives the film an authentic feel. Viewers who know Maine's mid-coast will see many familiar attractions in Rockport and Camden where the film takes place. Even the route numbers for the hidden Maine highways are also accurate. The only fault I found was with Marisa Tomei's ""Maine accent."" To me it sounded like a Brooklyn accent with dropped ""R"" sounds, but this is nitpicking and it by no means was a distraction. As a matter of fact I'm sure only a Boston born and Massachusetts raised would have noticed the accent.

As some reviewers have noted, the film is not fast paced, which after reading the summary on the cover, may catch people by surprise. For me, this is not a drawback. The film is based on a story by writer Andre Dubus, a writer whose words should be savored and appreciated and the pace and length of this film allows viewers to savor and appreciate the moods and feelings of the characters.",1138924800,,2089,4.550531914893617

Perhaps the Director deliberately makes the pace slower to depict the nature of Maine.  Wilkinson (a doctor) and Spacek (music director) are one of those good doers family with a son (studying to be an architect) heading back for summer.  Stahl (the son) is involved with a single mother of two in the form of Tomei.  Her previous marriage with the ex-husband (separated but not divorced) is estranged and that causes tension between the three parties that are involved.  Then, everything comes to a blow and tragedy strikes.  Akin to Mystic River, whilst everybody is adjusting to the tragedy and yearn to move on with their lives, underneath the tranquility, there's a boiling rage to avenge, an eye for an eye.  In one of the scenes, whilst playing poker with friends, one of them commented that it's the quiet one that's lethal.  That statement resonates through the rest of the movie.  Whilst some are pointing fingers and this person and that, whilst some are at loss for words and wondered why something like this would have happened, some are plotting to do what they deem is necessary to square off things.  Once again, we are led to yet another unexpected and tragic ending.  I have to say that I'm emotionally drained after the movie.  If you are looking for a deep and thought provoking movie, this is the one for you.  It doesn't get five Oscar nominations for no reasons.

It is brutal and sad, then it winds down for an awfully long time, with raw emotions playing behind the surface of events.  In many ways, the best part is about the pain of the aftermath as life goes on and you witness what is left.  There are many levels at which this can be viewed:  as a comment on our criminal justice system and vengance, the evolution of long-term and durable marriages, or the upheavals of unwilling divorce.  For me, it was the older marriage that was the emotional center of this movie, the anchor of all the themes.

Watching this is difficult as it addresses many of our ultimate fears as parents.  The realism is so rough that not much of this is fun.  Recommended for serious film goers, those who would rather see a slice of life than watch a football game.",1130630400,,863,4.35

Looking at other reviews, there are also apparently those who can't tell the difference between a cliche and an authentically acted tale of everyday people in extraordinary circumstances; the story told here is not as important as the way it's told.  ""In the Bedroom"" is one of those rare smallish dramas that makes the viewer feel like a fly on the wall, and that's one reason some viewers don't get it; they find real life boring, and expect (and need) explosions, nude scenes, gore, and filth to make them feel something.

In short, this is an exquisite film for people who really love film and aren't looking for pure escapism.  In a sense it's a cousin of ""Ordinary People,"" but without the histrionics.

How can I not give full credit to the mesmerizing performances from Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson whose ""from-the-kitchen-to-the-bedroom-fight-scene"" was so captivating. This film clearly brought Marisa Tomei's career back from the dead, and her striking performance also got her second Oscar nomination in the supporting actress category.

The movie is fairly long(2 hrs 10 min) but quality movies take time to develop and unfold. Are we supposed to care that much about characters who we only see for an hour and a half?

1730893,4,B00006953K,"It is fairly unusual for an independent film to be the victim of a misleading ad campaign, but ""In The Bedroom"" may be such a rarity. More than a few people I told about this film said that they were not interested because it appears to be a revenge sort of film. The guy kills the son who is dating his ex-wife and then goes on a vendetta against the rest of the family. If this is also your opinion, after watching the ads, let me just say that the ads are a little misleading. Although there are elements of revenge within the film, ""In The Bedroom"" is one of the best films released in 2001.

Matt and Ruth Fowler (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) are a middle-aged couple living in a small town in Massachusetts (I think). Their son, Frank, is back from college for the summer and working on his lobster boat. He also falls in love with Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei), a divorced mom with two kids. Matt and Ruth are shaken a bit by their son's new lover, but they accept her, to a degree, when they see how much her son loves her. Richard Strout (William Mapother), the ex-husband, isn't taking too well to the break-up or the new lover and his violent tendencies increase.

""In The Bedroom"", the first film directed by Todd Field (an actor who has appeared in various films, including ""Eyes Wide Shut""), is a quiet, accomplished, powerful film exploring the fabric of a family's life. Field thrusts us into the story very quickly. The first scene depicts Frank and Natalie running through a field. Then we watch them at a family picnic. My point is that the relationship has already begun and they have already developed a certain amount of history. Both of her kids are already attached to Frank. This is a highly effective way of quickly and abruptly thrusting us into the story, ramping up our involvement in their lives. As we realize that these characters are already ""together"" that forces us to have an investment in their relationship. Field also depicts certain things in a tableau form. Brief shots of various characters sitting quietly contemplating or moving woodenly through their day, communicate far more than a highly theatrical scene of someone yelling or screaming. This method of depicting certain things, and leaving other things to our imaginations, also helps to ground the film in realism. ""In The Bedroom"" is a remarkably accomplished first film and makes me anticipate his next film even more.

Field's accomplished direction is further enhanced by the fine performances by his cast. Sissy Spacek creates one of the most memorable characters I have ever seen in a film. Her portrayal of Ruth, the mother, is mesmerizing. Throughout the first half of the film you get a sense of her deepening disquiet and wonder what, besides her disapproval of her son's relationship, might be lurking underneath. In the second half of the film, her anger makes itself known, but without the showy theatrics associated with many similar types of performances. For a leading role, Spacek remains quiet through many scenes, yet effectively communicates her feelings through her face and body language. I really believed she was in this marriage and Frank's mother and had a history with this family.

Tom Wilkinson, probably best remembered for his role as General Cornwallis in ""The Patriot"", is equally remarkable as Matt Fowler. For the first half of the film, he quietly gives in to his son at every turn, and in fact, Frank turns to him when his mother disapproves. He has a medical practice, but leaves most days at lunch, to either fish with his son, or spend some time with him. He also brings a note of jealousy to the character, indicating that perhaps Matt is jealous of his son. In the second half of the film, his character makes many changes as well, but they are also believable and compelling.

The supporting cast is equally memorable. Nick Stahl brings a refreshing sense of enthusiasm and bravery to the role of Frank. You really get a sense that Frank is in love with Natalie, cares for her kids and loves his life. As he made various decisions throughout the film, I found myself compelled to shout to him to do something different. Of course, I didn't, but the fact that I considered this proves the power of his performance. I have never really been a fan of Marisa Tomei, but her performance as Natalie is very strong and believable. Natalie is a woman that is trying to have a happy life, a strong life and an independent life. In the film, we get a sense that she has finally reached that point, except for the influence of her ex-husband. There is a scene between Natalie and Ruth that is fairly brief, but very memorable.

I don't care for Sissy Spacek's grieving mother histrionics and finger-pointing, although that kind of performance is to be expected. I also don't like Marisa Tomei at all, so her presence is not much validation for this film. On the other hand, the brief performance of Nick Stahl as the ill-fated younger man in the older woman-younger man relationship seems predictive of potentially excellent performances in Stahl's future (not to mention his impressive resume to date in various productions like Man without a Face, Carnivale, and The Thin Red Line). Also the blood-curdling performance of William Mapother as the jealous ex-husband was worthwhile. Nevertheless, I still felt as though there was something missing from this film.

The director was trying to be artsy by subjecting us viewers to scene after scene after scene of the dead boy's parents being reminded of his former existence.

After that, there's about an hour of meaningless dialogue, and establishing shots of Sissy Spacek smoking cigarettes.

But later you discover there's a lot of pain and frustration that has been bubbling deep beneath the surface for years -- very true to life.

The plot takes you in an unusual direction for a Hollywood movie, and the two big scenes (especially the climactic scene), are surprising for such a soberly-paced and subtle story.

The pacing is slow, and the ending is full of potential interpretations.  When I watched it late one night, I thought the ending was simply unresolved, almost as if the author and director weren't sure where they had taken us, but by morning, I had a completely different interpretation, with a very definite opinion about the surviving relationship.

The way this was originally marketed, I expected a different movie than the one I watched.  I was expecting something far more suspenseful, but what I watched was slower and more true to life.

 Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Matt Fowler, a likeable, down to earth physician who takes his lunch every day just to visit his son at his job catching lobsters. Sissy Spacek plays Ruth, his wife, a seemingly judgmental and even bitter woman, who doesn't approve of her son's relationship with an older, estranged woman and her two sons. Nick Stahl is Frank, the son, whose blooming maturity inhibits him from following his heart and telling the truth. He can't seem to admit that his relationship with Natalie is anything more than a summer fling.

 The movie takes a violent and tragic turn, and the results are devastating for the three remaining characters. Marisa Tomei is Natalie, afraid to face her husband's wrath or do anything about it.

 The movie has many, many powerful and gut-wrenching moments. The acting is superb. Wilkinson who really has the most screen time plays the father with such restraint, warmth and compassion that you feel like he IS Matt Walker. He is matched by Sissy Spacek's most powerful performance. Spacek uses her body, her eyes, her speeches to convey the anger and guilt she feels and refusing to get on with her life. Tomei gives her best performance as Natalie, a ""good"" woman, caught in the trap of loving someone so much younger, and wanting to be forgiven in her role in Frank's death. This performance validates the surprise Oscar she won for My Cousin Vinny. William Mapother as Natalie's estranged husband oozes deception, self-serving and empty individual, feeling no remorse for his deed. Celia Weston who plays Katie, the wife of one of the Fowler's friends, is memorable in a scene in which she and Ruth are going through Katie's family album, and she slips with an unintentionally hurtful remark. Lots of power between these two men.

 So where does this movie go wrong? It's MACBETH like ending seems so unreal compared to the rest of the movie. Without spoiling its ending, it seems so out of character for the man we've spent two hours with, and the ending itself lacks a true emotional impact. It seems like the movie just ends.

About forty minutes into the film, however, things go violently wrong. Frank is murdered by his girlfriend's ex-husband, and from this moment on, all normalcy leaves the film. It is also at this point, however, that the movie takes on a beautifully realized melancholy, and truly becomes the film that has received so much critical acclaim.
After Frank's murder, the film centers around the grief of Dr. and Mrs. Fowler. Dr. Fowler feels, and displays, his grief quietly. Tom Wilkinsons is brilliant as the man who, while obviously grief-stricken, is still trying to get on with his ordinary life.
Sissy Spacek as Mrs. Fowler is the epitome of quiet rage. She manages to infuse the simplest of acts - smoking a cigarette, watching her husband pour himself a drink - with an angry desparation that is simmering just beneath the surface. This anger is shockingly realized in a moment where Mrs. Fowler is approached by an apologetic Natalie, and slaps her brutally, only to resume her work as if nothing important has just occurred.
The film was also beautifully shot. Immediately following Frank's death, rather than succumbing to the soap opera cliches of excessive crying, the melancholy is displayed through very brief vignettes that fade in and out - a sleeping Mrs. Fowler, Dr. Fowler seeing patients, mowing the lawn. They are normal enough scenes, but the blackness that surrounds them visually only echoes the blackness that surrounds them emotionally.
The soundtrack is stunningly bare. Rather than try to find a musical metaphor for grief, the directors chose to leave background music to a minimum. The majority of the music in the film is the beautiful work of the chorus which Mrs. Fowler directs.
Ultimately, the quiet grief and rage that Dr. and Mrs. Fowler are feeling erupts, and they express their true feelings to each other, in an attempt to place blame and make sense of this murder. When it does erupt, the film takes a final drastic, and yet fitting turn.
I highly recommend this movie. I don't think it's possible to see it and not be touched by it.",1087084800,,2412,4.9287469287469285

1730916,2,B00006953K,"Sure this film has some nice performances and is elegantly filmed, but I'm not going to shower it with praises just for that. Now, I warn you this film is extremely boring. No, not slow paced. Don't confuse slow paced with boring. That is like saying a slow song is boring. No, not true. One can be fast paced and boring. This film, has no pace, it is just BORING.Do we really need countless shots that last for minutes at a time of the characters sitting alone in rooms, staring at the walls, or fifteen minute fishing scenes????Maybe that wouldn't be such a problem if there was a gripping story to back all that up. But there just isn't. The son gets killed, and the parents grieve for the next three fourths of the film. Then, in the last fifteen minutes,the dad goes out and gets revenge. THATS IT. Not only is the premise not too original, the film never grabs you. It never makes you stop and feel all that much, it never becomes the intense and emotional film it was deemed to be. The whole thing just feels sort of half-baked. You want to feel right there in the moment, in the pain, in those charcters' hearts and minds. But you just can't because the film never lets loose and allows any intensity, or emotion through.
Sissy Spacek is average. Her acting is good, but its nowhere near the line of ""best actress of the year stuff"".uh uh. No way. I could never really reach out to her character. Throughout the whole film,there was really no presence felt from her, she was just there. Tom Wilkinson did give a great, honest performance, and was perhaps the one thing that made me feel any sort of grief for the family's loss. Marisa Tomei never gets developed. We see her fondling with the son, then we see her scream after he gets murdered, and then she just vanishes. The supporting actors were good, but not spectacular.
This film tries way too hard to be low key and ""realistic"".I just found it boring, and hard to sit through. Despite a strong performance from Tom Wilkinson, I cant really think of a single reason that would make me recommend this film.",1080259200,,2069,4.461741424802111

All the stylistic tropes are buried beneath the surface. It looks simple - the tale of a family tragedy and its consequences - yet its execution and orchestration are sophisticated in the extreme. It is apparent that Field has not only studied the masters of cinematic understatement, such as Ozu and Bergman, but that he fully understands their processes. Consequently, this is a film that lives beyond its two hours. In some ways, Field's achievement is such a perfectly consummated marriage of intent and execution that he need never make another movie.

If I could give half stars here I would it give 3 and a bit. It is better than most 3 star movies for it type but not really a four and certainly not a 5 if you know your movies and have seen these actors elsewhere or films with the exact same theme.
The film has a lot of plus points. It has some really good moments in the story and some interesting character direction but ultimately does not really justify itself by the time the credits roll and in terms of atonement and resolve (the two central themes in this film) then that is not good because there is a lot of loose ends here. Also the actual forensic work (or lack of it) behind the murder that takes place in this film is a little lacking. Basically it sort of says that if you shoot someone and no one sees you do it, but you get caught anyway, then you will likely only be done for manslaughter which does stretch things a bit for a film that tries its hardest to be a realistic drama.
The acting is on top form though and that is really why you should watch this film. There are many flashes or anger, repression and pain throughout the story that are sometimes subtle and sometimes very strong. It is all good there and it has lots going for it in that department. While the story is good it is still 50/50 when all is said and done.
Better than most Hollywood drivel, but not up there with the other films that have done this same theme much better before. Worth renting, only ownership for those who really like it.",1074902400,,1753,4.040229885057471

1730922,5,B00006953K,"One of the most intelligent films of recent years to examine the question of justice.  It's also a set up.  The ""bad guys"" - a mother who is a music teacher, a father who is a doctor - have one son, talented, extremely handsome, who is likely to be an architect (what else?) but indulged by the couple to the extent that his ""summer fling"" of sleeping with a single mother of two (who happens to be the estranged partner of the son of the richest man in town) is accepted with equanimity (at least without complaint) by them.  The mother allows a worrying frown to cross her brow, the father is just VERY understanding and non-judgemental.  The ""good guy"", who is (perhaps understandably) left by the single mother (Marissa Tomei), is thought by all to be a thoroughly unpleasant, spoilt, roue who has been known to resort to domestic violence to get his way with Ms Tomei.  I say ""bad guys"" because the couple want and exact revenge for the loss of their son (accidentally? shot by the ""good guy"".)  I say ""good guy"" because he is the one abandoned, who sees his ex-partner and their children openly enjoying the hospitality and friendship of  the parents of his younger rival, and is murdered by the doctor - and it's a murder conducted in a pre-meditated, calculating, planned and carefully executed way.  So that's the ""set up"". One of course is meant to sympathise with the middle class couple and despise the rich guy's son and cuckold and cheer when he ""gets it"".  When we do, if we do, then we are complicit in seeking to act outside the justice system, and by extension, support those who do.

1730923,5,B00006953K,"What an incredible accomplishment.  And what I found out after watching this amazing movie was the director is new to directing and that this was his first film.  I was shocked, utterly and completely shocked.  You know why?  Because this film knocked the socks off of me and proved itself to be one of those movies that stays with you for years after seeing it!  It was so unbelievably good.  Don't listen to people who say that the script lacks and that the acting lacks because that is all a lie.
First of all, this is the *best picture of 2001*, and it should have won Best Picture.  This movie is exciting, well-acted, well-written, well everything!  It is a flawless indie in all respects.
And the acting alone was the best in 2001.  Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson performed a tango of fights, glances and dark conversations that molded the movie into perfect form.  And Marisa Tomei (who proved herself to me here) leaves you with that feeling of ""when is she going to come back?"" and ""I want her to feel better!""  She creates a character that is so lovable and dark and torn that you find yourself caring for her all the time, despite anything that she's done.  If it were just another actress playing this role, then the film wouldn't have been the same.  Tomei was definately the greatest part.
Just a quick review of the synopsis: Tomei starts dating the eight-years-younger son (a powerful-with-subtlety Nick Stahl) of Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson.  But Tomei's ex-husband can't accept that they aren't married any longer.  So jealousy takes hold, and so does revenge, and so does anger.  And the consequences of these emotions start to overload and develop into a tragedy about a family gone wrong.  But who's to blame?
Okay, I do have one or two disclaimers.  First of all, the name ""In the Bedroom"" (for all of you concerned parents out there) has absolutely nothing to do with sex!  This movie is rated R for violence and a scene of bad language, NOT SEX!  In the bedroom is a saying equivelent to ""three's a crowd,"" which is the theme of the film.  And yes, this movie, I admit, may be boring to some.  But remember, the excitement is mostly projected from the pace of the film, the well-portrayed emotions of the actors and the one or two events that get this movie going (which can be another disclaimer to some).  And I know those three reasons sound subtle and superfluous.  But trust me, it will take your breath away.  This film was amazing!
Bottom Line: The best film of 2001 with the best acting, writing and overall...best-ness (?). (I give it an A+)",1065916800,,2578,4.588621444201313

It builds up very plausibly, and about 100 minutes into it I'm sure there's going to be a great ending based on everything we've learned.
Unfortunately, I feel like the movie drops the ball.  It should have focused either more on the internal feelings of the characters and dropped their external actions, or it should have focused more on the after-effects of their external actions (without making it longer).  As it is, the movie ending is somewhat puzzling and unsatisfying.

1730925,1,B00006953K,"Just like American Beauty this movie is grossly overrated. Why? Because just like American Beauty the director and screenwriter are trying to pull a fast one on the audience. Don't get me wrong: this is a ""well-made film""...but really, so what?! Ernest Goes To Jail is a ""well-made film""...that doesn't make it ""brilliant"" or ""powerful"" or whatever choice adjectives will be tossed out there to compel you into swallowing this load of crap. In fairness, it should be noted that all of the acting is uniformly outstanding throughout, perhaps none more so than Tom Wilkinson. Too bad his character is so villainously abused by the screenplay.
The main problem is the unbelievable and pointless (therefore pretentious) ending. The dead man's father in this movie would have NEVER committed murder. It was completely inconsistent with his character developed through the course of the film. None of the possible explanations for his ultimate actions make sense. Are we supposed to believe he did it because he was secretly in love/lust with his dead son's girlfriend?! Assuming he had any feelings for his son's girlfriend why then would he murder her children's father. Also, would a man (and a doctor at that) who just lost his son take away the father of children he knows and has shown affection for? No way - ergo, more BS. Or maybe he did it because his wife wanted it? Then what's the point of the scene where he accuses her of being bitter and she admits it?! ""You're right...I'm controlling and angry and not properly dealing with my son's murder emotionally. It's my fault...but BTW, would you please go kill my son's murderer anyway?"" Stupid.
Excluding reasonable possibilities for the father's behavior (of which there are exactly none) what's left is a pretentious excuse for literary laziness, like the ""the unfathomability of human behavior"", or some other faux-deep theme that, were there any artistic accountability in Hollywood, the director and screenwriter would be deeply ashamed of. Perhaps they will claim that they were ""faithfully exploring the themes and drama as presented in the original story"". That doesn't wash. I could make a film ""faithfully exploring the themes and drama"" extracted from a list of ingredients on a condiment bottle and call it a metaphor for ""the unfathomability of human behavior"" and be just as correct given all the guessing these filmmakers would like us to engage in trying to make sense of this turkey's ending. It's sad that noone associated with this production had the brains or guts to say ""hey...this ending makes no f*ing sense...maybe it should be reworked to be the least bit believable"". If they wanted it to be some sort of Ang Lee remake of Death Wish then at least show the audience how a killing for catharsis or revenge pays off emotionally (a repugnant sentiment but at least one in the realm of possibility) and not some snoozy ending that shows the defiled main character pondering his lobster-induced finger wound. WTF was that?!
After wasting two hours on this disappointing film I can least take grim satisfaction in knowing that it will age very poorly and eventually prove an embarassment to the director and screenwriter. As for the hype, doesn't it seem that Hollywood just loves congratulating itself for how brilliant it is? It seldom seems to do so at the right times.",1060387200,,3348,4.959074733096085
1730926,5,B00006953K,"This is one of the finest power dramas released in 2001.  ""In the Bedroom"" digs deep into the characters' emotions rather than the action.  The lack of musical score gives it that extra raw edge, which is especially necessary in the violent scenes.  The movie environment makes the characters look like ordinary people rather than supermodels with a tough life. More movies should do this.
Sissy Spacek makes a triumphant comeback as a mother whose son is murdered.  Tom Wilkinson brilliantly plays her revenge seeking husband.  Their conflicts give ""In the Bedroom"" the extra realism that it needs.  Few know that many couples have these marital problems in this situation.  The duo proves that they researched these issues before filming as did Marisa Tomei for her role as a mother of two who witnesses her boyfriend's murder.  Tomei's extra demand is performed wonderfully when her character's abusive soon-to-be ex-husband stalks her.  Nick Stahl's lack-of-media-credit role proves that he'll perform bigger roles in the next few years.
""In the Bedroom"" was well-deserving of its five Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe win(Sissy Spacek-Best Actress).  This is a wonderful movie for those who are looking for an emotional drama.

From the initial tension between the parents and the girlfriend to the killing, to the grieving and finally the cathartic revenge, the film holds a tight grip on the viewer and does not let go.
What I found most intriguing about this powerful film is the slow disintegration of the happy surface veneer of the marriage of the two parents. The tragedy forces the parents to confront their own faults, fears and ill feelings concerning their son and each other. The silence is finally broken, and the lack of communication in their marriage as a whole is finally addressed. The scenes intimate the sometimes vast difference between what is displayed in public and what is really happening underneath the surface of a relationship behind closed doors. The confrontation between Spacek and Wilkinson is one of the strongest and most potent scenes I have seen in a long while.

1730930,5,B00006953K,"A difficult movie, but WELL worth the effort.  I'm surprised at some of the less than rave reviews here.
This is a movie that is unflinchingly unpredictable.  Everyone is totally believable, but you never have any idea what a character is going to do next.  It's richly written, with beautiful texture and pacing (the pacing is slow, but it's like slow boil...stuff IS happening).  And the plot is familiar at one moment and totally unique the next.
The first ""act"" deals with introducing us to loving couple Sissy Spacke and Tom Wilkerson (although we can tell that many years together has led to a small dose of ""familiarity breeds contempt""...this couple is believably ""non-intimate"" like many long-termed married couples are...they fight, they give each other looks and yet we know they are committed to each other).  Their son, Nich Stahl, a young man barely out of high school, is engaged in an affair with an ""older"" woman (Marisa Tomei). When her estranged husband finds out, tragedy ensues.
The second ""act"" shows how the loss of their son, particularly to  violence, leads to feelings of helplessness, remorse, hatred, desire for revenge, and most of all, a near total emtional estrangement between the couple.  We aren't just dealing with a generic ""grief"" as we have seen in countless TV-movies.  This movie dares to show how these two likeable people are ravaged by their loss.  RAVAGED.  Whew, it's some tough, emotional stuff, but so believably presented as to be thrilling at the same time.  Near the end of this act, there is a scene where the couple nearly come to blows and start spewing out their accusations with the kinds of words and insults that you can't take back...you know the kind.  How this spell is broken is an absolutely amazing, surprising and REAL scene.  Not with theatrical gestures and grandoise speeches, but with the arrival of a little girl selling candy for a fundraiser.  Don't ask...just watch and be totally moved.
Act Three is vengeance.  Many have argued that this act pulls the movie out of reality and into ""Hollywood"" or at least into another genre of film.  Yet is it really such a stretch that the couple would find new unity through their desire for revenge.  And how much, really, if YOU were the parent of a murdered child, would it take to send you in thirst for revenge.  And again, the movie doesn't take an easy, predictable road down this act either.
The acting is uniformly OUTSTANDING.  Sissy Spacek, a much admired actress who has always frankly left me just a little cold, is GREAT.  She allows herself to sink into her despair, yet remain cold and tightly wound.  She has a scene with Tomei that is startlingly in its actions and emotional rawness.  She is vulnerable, in all senses of that word for an actress.  Speaking of vulnerable, the much-maligned Marisa Tomei is riveting.  I've always hated that she caught so much grief after winning her Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY.  You know what...she's a pretty darn good actress.  She has a vulnerable quality that just shines from her.  She's BELIEVABLY sweet and sexy, and in IN THE BEDROOM, she is stripped raw too, with guilt and sadness.
But the truly revelatory performance comes from Tom Wilkerson, most famous before this for THE FULL MONTY.  He is at once stubborn, tender, funny, loving, tough, whimpy, sad, determined, intelligent, emotional.  He juggles all his emotions and all his character's transitions with TOTAL control and believability. Denzel Washington won the Oscar for TRAINING DAY...Russell Crowe was heavily favored by some for A BEAUTIFUL MIND, but it was Wilkerson who really gave the most astonishing performance of the year.
All the characters were presented as people we might know...really know.  Thus, their draining emotional journeys can be empathized with.  It's a bleak and beautiful movie and one I can't recommend highly enough for an adult audience.",1053561600,,3900,4.91743119266055

As a high school choir director living with her doctor husband in a lobster town in Maine, the incomparable Sissy Spacek unleashes yet another in a long line of riveting performances, this one as the mother of a 21-year-old son (Nick Stahl) who is murdered by his new girlfriend's (Marisa Tomei) jealous estranged husband. From there, Spacek's character of Ruth Fowler races for an absolution that doesn't come, and it's that second loss of redemption that brings her in conflict with husband Matt (British actor Tom Wilkinson in an equally raw performance). Both he and Spacek were justly Oscar-nominated, as was Tomei in a powerful turn that far supercedes her earlier Oscar win in ""My Cousin Vinny."" ""In the Bedroom"" works for essentially two reasons: a strong and realistic plot acted by strong performers acting like real people grappling with real feelings, and its visual simplicity. Freshman director Todd Field is masterful in focusing his film family's devastation on anger (at the judicial system, their son's killer and, to an extent, the woman whose husband did the crime) rather than grief, and it is that anger which leads to a finalty that, although reluctantly expected, is nonetheless shattering. But if the drama and helpless witnessing of a family jetting toward disintegration is not something a viewer wants to see, Spacek's numbing performance alone makes a watch worthy.

Set during summertime in the picturesque fishing town of Camden, Maine, In the Bedroom examines the lives of Matt Fowler (brilliantly handled by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson) and his choral director wife, Ruth (a great Sissy Spacek). Both are concerned about the increasingly serious relationship between their college-aged son Frank (Nick Stahl) and Natalie (beautifully handled by Marisa Tomei), a woman ten years his senior. Compounding matters are Natalie's two young boys and the unwanted presence of her estranged husband, Richard (an appropriately menacing William Mapother).
When Frank informs his father that, rather than head off to graduate school to become an architect, he might simply take up lobster trawling for a living in order to remain close to Natalie and her boys, the expected family crisis ensues. Ruth can't abide the thought of her only child throwing away his future on a woman who isn't even divorced from her first husband, while Matt remains stubbornly convinced that Frank will eventually do the right thing and head off to school.
Sadly, tragedy intervenes in the form of the bitterly jealous Richard, whose fateful confrontation with Frank triggers a devastating string of events that forever changes the lives of all involved. The cracks in Matt and Ruth's marriage takes center stage as the seemingly well-adjusted couple is forced to deal with the grief over what's happened and the lack of communication that has steadily eroded the bedrock of their marriage over the years.
The ultimate action the couple takes to, literally, save their marriage, if not their very sanity, proves the film's riskiest move. But it works simply because of the deeper issue of a husband's loyalty to his wife and the strength the two draw from one another to live through a terrible situation.
In the Bedroom bravely addresses the impossibility of finding true justice when the hurt is so deep, and the loss so great, that no amount of judicial punishment can fill the void.
Antonio Calvache's photography compares to painter Andrew Wyeth's haunting canvas ""Christina's World,"" and the film pays its debt to Wyeth and the idyllic yet strangely tragic images he produced throughout the film. The score is appropriately understated, never getting in the way of the dramatic interplay between the characters. The acting is simply peerless.
On the downside, Field allows the film to drag a bit during the middle third, and poker playing scenes that have one of Matt's friends reciting poems by Blake and Frost come across as a little too obviously connected to the plot at hand.
In the Bedroom is a tough, honest movie, one that might have shined even brighter had it not relied on shocking surprises, instead simply laying its cards on the table from the outset and working backwards to show how its characters reached their current situation. As it is, the film is still head and shoulders above the average fare, revealing an undeniably potent intensity that lingers long after the lights have gone up in the theater.",1044144000,,3503,5.0102915951972555

Small East coast town , usual people , usual little problems ... and tragedy strikes . The only son is killed by the ex of his girlfriend . But legal sistem works at it best , and killer still on the street . Parenths of the dead boy se him everywhere in this little town . What would you do ?
The moments of this movie , which shocked me the most :
First - when father walked in the son's room ... camera slowly shows the close on the floor , short on the chear ...the pillow with a headprint still on it ... he touches it ... and I swear , I felt the pain .
Second - when father faced the killer on the street. He looks at him ... slowly lookes down... and lookes back at him with the same speed as he rises hand with a gun .
And last one - when father quietly walks back to the bedroom... we shocked by surprise - his wife is awake and waiting in the bad ... few quiet seconds ... Did you do it ? - we shocked by her question as much as he was .

Gosh! I didn't expect this storyline at all. I thought I was in for a romance but soon saw that I was witnessing a thriller.
A college boy and an older single mother are dating and the boy's parents(Spacek and Wilkinson) are a bit worried about it all. Then something unbelievable happens and the boy's parents are forced into a land of reality as they must deal with the horrible tragedy that's occured, a tragedy that was spawned through his relationship with the older woman.
From that point on, you will not unglue your eyes from the television - not even once.  The course of actions that take place from there on are astonishing but, realistically, they are actions that even you and me could see ourselves involved in if bad things happened to our family.

1730942,4,B00006953K,"It's always a challenge to view a movie after it's garnered a few Oscars, because of the hype. If I could point one reason as to why this movie was so well received by the Academy, I would say it was the courage and abandon with which it went against the grain of New England (American?) conservatism (it's another conversation as to how such a simple concept of art should seem to innovative to Hollywood).
The symbolism of a house, and the bedroom that separate the people living in it is strong -- they are physically together, but mentally stored away in different compartments... perhaps for good reason. Son Frank (Nick Stahl) is studying to be an architect, and drafts elaborate structures of dream houses in his room. Dad Matt (Tom Wilkinson, who is really the star of the film, despite what everybody says about co-star Sissy Spacek's performance) is a doctor who can't fix what's going wrong with his family this summer. Mom Ruth (Spacek) conducts hymns that doesn't salve her astute perceptions of the world. Yet because the symbolism is so strong, so apparent in every nook and cranny, its overabundance renders it somewhat contrived.
The direction is exemplary, and if nothing else, the performances elevate the film a few notches above what it actually is. After the first tragedy of the movie strikes, the camera splices up scenes that mimick the on-screen relationship fragmentation, and by the time there's an abject role reversal between the parents, you get the feeling that the pieces won't come together again.",1039651200,,1531,4.892307692307693

I usually stay away from movies that have won a ton of Oscars or whatever because they are usually dull as can possibly be.  This movie basically proved my theory yet again.  I rented the movie because it was supposed to be suspenseful.  Well, that it definitely wasn't.  I mean, you knew what was going to happen as soon as you see the bad, bad ex-husband.  There was at least one scene that was shocking even though you knew it was going to happen just the way it was shown on film.  I will say that the acting was really good in ""In the Bedroom"".  All the lead characters did great work, but there was no suspense!  I mean the movie is over two hours long and it feels like 3+ just because it's so slow and quiet most of the time.  At least 30 minutes could have been cut out of this film and it would have been better and kept the same meaning.

The action, when it comes, takes the viewer by surprize because the film so lanquidly tells the story of these people.  I found the juxtaposition of the men and women in the film with the lobsters, so important to the small Maine coastal town, brilliant.  You realize quite quickly that the scene on the lobster boat, where the Dr. says that two male lobsters can't be in a trap, in the bedroom, at the same time and that the older female lobster can kill the males, too, is important because of the link with the title.  Immediately, the volatile relationships of lobsters are juxtaposed with that of the triangle of Natalie, Matt, and Natalie's ex.  Later, and more subtly, the metaphor is further drawn out to include the Dr., his wife, and Natalie's ex.  Both women, in their own way, become the older female lobster that kills the males.  I never thought lobsters could be so profound!  This movie was slow, but beautifully so.  I highly recommend.  Sissy Spacek gets better with age; Tom Wilkinson is great.

And that is obvious by reading many of the reviews here (some reviews, by the way, are rather disturbing--suggesting that the ""violent scenes"" weren't enough to keep it going, making me wonder if they think there needs to be violence in movies to add excitement).
Anyway, no need to rehash the details of the story (you're best off knowing little to nothing about the story before you see it).  Also no need to say that the actors are quite excellent (Tom Wilkinson a particular standout; he's really the star of the show).  What I do want to note is the direction, editing, and lighting in the film.  I haven't seen a movie with this kind of directorial flair in a long time that didn't come across as too forced or pretentious.  And that became obvious from the very beginning, as the opening scene faded out to the open credits.  I found it quite stunning.  Made me wish I had seen it in the theater instead of waiting for the video.
Some people didn't enjoy this movie because they were too busy taking sides with the characters, the issues, etc.  That's not important here.  Does every character in every movie either need to be all good or all bad to be understood by your average moviegoer?  Does everyone in the movie need to behave the way you would?  Isn't part of the reason we watch movies to witness other people's experiences and imagine what it must be like to experience them yourselves?  Call me dumb (which I'm not), but I thought that was the point to this film.

Then you watch the screen and wonder what the fuss was about.
This happened to both my wife and I watching ""In the Bedroom"".  What makes it more amazing is that we go into the movie rooting for it.  The big problem was pacing.  Even though the movie has a handful of very violent acts, which I won't reveal here, we still both found the movie very slow, and even with the violent acts, some of which are shocking, we were actually waiting for something to happen.
Explanation.  The movie is not really about the violent things that happen, it's how the families involved react to them.  This we understood, and it's this we have the problem with.  We get multiple shots consisting of the camera showing only the facial expressions of the actors, often without even music in the background.  I suppose we are to believe that the actors are so good they can transfer these emotions to us, but it didn't work with us.  Yes, there are a few times when people finally express their feelings, but more often than not we see them suppressing their growing unhappiness.  Even at a poker game, where people speak their minds at every one of the many I've been too, we see uncomfortable silences ending with one of the guys spouting poetry.  Yeah, right.  Ladies, this is not how guys act at poker games.
Yes, I compared it to ""Ordinary People"".  Both movies show how families are torn apart by tragedy.  Go catch that one.  You care about the families more, and they seem to be a bit more honest about expressing their emotions.",1035158400,,1826,4.521341463414634

1730953,5,B00006953K,"and my only criticism might be a slightly slow pacing in the film.  First time director Todd Field uses the fine touch of a stage director to use the ordinary American Home as a backdrop with incredible symbolism.  One of the truly symbolic gestures of the film is Spacek's chain smoking -- it says more about her anxiety and anguish than words could ever tell.  In the final scene, a lazy spiral of smoke from the cigarette she leaves on the nightstand tells us exactly who is at peace, at last.
Not so Tom Wilkinson, as the father, in an amazing performance.  Wilkinson's ease at demonstrating, rather than talking of his feelings and pride for his son and his wife is remarkable.  At the close of the film, it is he you worry about -- someone whose soul will continue to be ravaged by violence, even by his own hand.  The killing in the films takes place largely offscreen, but the violence is jarring and raw.
Marisa Tomei picks up the vibration from him, and much of her character's feeling is reflected in the way she looks, and not what she says.  There are other fine performances in the film, including Spacek, who drives everyone to distraction.  The Eastern European dirges she has her choir perform on the anniversary of her son's death are as mournful as anything I've ever heard.
In the Bedroom is not for everyone.  You have to want your films to be told by nuance instead of dialogue -- or to have an interesting mix of both.  Filming is beautiful, but the additional DVD qualities are just ordinary.

1730956,5,B00006953K,"""In The Bedroom"" was probably one of the best films of 2001. Written and directed by first-timer, Todd Field, it's certainly bound to be a classic. ""In The Bedroom"" takes place in the quiet, small town of Camden, Maine. There, we meet a pretty normal family: the husband, Matt Fowler (Tom Wilkinson), his wife, Ruth Fowler (Sissy Spacek), and their college-aged son, Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl). Frank is the son anybody could ever hope for: he's young, talented, good-looking, kind, and intelligent. But when he comes home for the summer from college, he gets into a relationship with an older woman, Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei) who has two young children and is not yet divorced from her troubled husband, Richard Strout (William Mapother). Ruth and Matt have different opinions on Frank's romancing Natalie. Matt thinks Frank ""scored big-time"", while Ruth doesn't like the relationship at all and wants him to concentrate harder with his studies and to see someone closer to his own age. When Richard finds out about the affair, he is outraged and murders Frank one day while Frank is at Natalie's house with her. Now Matt and Ruth are in total grief over there loss, and the court won't put Richard in jail because they don't have complete proof that he had actually murdered Frank because there were no real witnesses. Matt and Ruth's relationship with each other is going down the drain because Frank was the only one who kept their relationship going. Now, Matt and Ruth must try to make the best of their lives and not give up on all hope.
The acting for ""In The Bedroom"" is what really made this film work, since there is no real action and at times it is pretty slow and can be depressing to watch. The script is definitely one of the best. Sissy Spacek has to be one of my all-time favorite actresses--she is just simply superb in any role she is given. Tom Wilkinson is wonderful and so are Nick Stahl, Marisa Tomei, and William Mapother. I've heard many mixed reviews about this particular film, but when I saw it in theaters I left at the end in total awe. The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras (available in wide screen format), but ""In The Bedroom"" is simply a must anyway.
I highly recommend ""In The Bedroom"".

1730957,5,B00006953K,"IN THE BEDROOM absolutely knocked me off balance.  I sat on the couch, watching this film, with my hand over my mouth half the time, a subconscious response to the tragedy unfolding before me.  This film contains the same powerful force and resonance as did REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and EYE OF GOD, which coincidentally starred Nick Stahl in another tragic role.  It is very depressing to watch though; I ask myself sometimes if I am a masochist, subjecting myself to these difficult films.
The performances are ""pitch perfect,"" a compliment which has been bestowed on Sissy Spacek numerous times.  Spacek is one of the most consistent actresses present who never lets us down with a less-than-perfect performance.  Here, her rage and sense for vengeance could match even that of Carrie's.  At the end, when her character, Ruth, asks her husband, ""Did you do it?"" the chills you get are indescribable, like a modern-day, small-town Lady MacBeth and her own ""Out, damned spot!""  Tom Wilkinson, trying on a New England accent, which you'd never know isn't first-nature to him, plays Matt Fowler, the husband.  His steely stare, his pallor, indeed, his voice all make me think that no one else could've played his role.  The casting was inspired.  Marisa Tomei, greatly undervalued due to cheesy roles in movies like WHAT WOMEN WANT, strikes many chords.  The scene where she visits Ruth to express condolences is devastating.  William Mapother, as Richard Strout, is terrifying.
This movie is more about things unsaid, things kept to oneself, which is more apparent in Andre Dubus's short story upon which the movie is based.  The restraint shown in the performances and in the directing style of Todd Field makes the scenes all the more tragic.  How can a parent ever be happy again?  In the end, the feeling that Matt's actions are justified even if they are not merciful strikes the biggest chord.  When he says, ""I couldn't wait any more,"" we all sympathize; we would've even done it for him if it hadn't meant so much for him to do it himself.
When REQUIEM FOR A DREAM used nightmarish striking imagery to enhance its message, IN THE BEDROOM uses images of the everyday and mundane, images far more affecting because we see them everyday ourselves, a fishing lure, an envelope in the mail, a trip to the market, a photo on the wall.  I hope this movie brings a special significance to these mundane artifacts, to elucidate their precious nature.

1730958,4,B00006953K,"In short,In The Bedromm is no more than a tale of our ""Death Penalty"" debates within a society that has gone insane with violence, a society that has sought war with every other in the globe but has not been able to come to terms with its own foes. This is the story of the psychopathic parent and the good citizen's kid that get slained by an attack of violence over family (and this could be interpreted as anything), that could be caused by jealousy,lack of patriotic power, or just plain balls. The movie really fails to tell how the woman got to be the wonderful screw that she is, to attract such a good ""blood"" boy and how the good blood is so good for who he is,whether this be caring, loving or just plain pathetic, because in real life anyone who has kids by someone else ""has been around the block"" and neither you or I would want them unless there was a very good reason. More than that, the creative (educated) parents should not miss that, because after all if all of us got to have the same kind of freedom there would be many more kids with real integrity and many more newborns with parents and more peace around this world. The grief and everything else that comes after, is just occupational hazard's sake for the movie's sucessful plot. I don't care what Bob Dole says, the death penalty is not something our government should have a right to enforce or a say to voice over, and citizens must be able to govern their own children, to the point of giving them emotional feedback to distinguish what is too dangerous for them and what is relatively safe to put up with, to be able to really fight for what they want and to quit what they must. The fact of the matter is that there are alot of good mothers out there who don't get a second chance with anyone because they have kids from another man and when the man decides to come back and be a father to his offspring then all hell must be bent solely for that cause, but yet can't be the same for the woman because she must be either a whore or a simple slut.

This movie had the writing on the wall from the very beginning you knew it was not going to be some uplifting tale. The atmosphere and setting was PERFECT.. Maine was beautiful, calm and peaceful to set the tone of a lifestyle that this young man had grown up in. A Father (who is the town Doctor)that loved him and a Mother (who was the local high school music teacher) both seeming to be understanding that there son was involved with a Older woman with 2 children, although it is evident that Sissy Spacek does not approve of this relationship.
I never really did understand if Marisa was divorced already or in the process of one with her (ex?)husband. I don't want to go into to much detail on the plot because I sometimes think you enjoy a movie more when you don't know WHAT to expect. The grieving in this movie is intense and very real, the frustrations are tangible. The Director did a INCREDIBLE job with letting you feel the emotions to EVERYONE in this movie not just the principal people I mean I KNEW how the friends felt, the nurse at the Doctors office I think that everyone did such a great job in this movie that it rates right up there with some of the best I've ever seen.
Beware it does get to a point where it slows down but don't give up on it, you never really know just how much time passes between the death and the end of the movie, but by the time the credits roll it all fits in very well.

Often their lives do unravel and this is all the more true if the death was a violent one like the murder in this film.  Catching every nuance perfectly, ""In The Bedroom"" portrays the anguish of one middle aged couple.  That they are mostly quiet about it is all the more telling and accurate.  We also see the events leading up to the murder.  The couple's son has been having a short term affair with an older woman who is going through a divorce.

Her soon-to-be ex-husband, played ably by Tom Cruise's real life cousin, William Mapother, can't handle their affair and explodes into violence.  This is also completely believable and Mapother doesn't make him a complete monster but, instead, someone we all know who spirals out of control while going through a divorce.  Wilkinson and Spacek both shine throughout as the middle-aged couple.  Watch especially Wilkinson's scenes as the film roars to a close.  They are very quiet and low-key yet the effect is electric.  He can make you believe he's on fire just by the simple act of facing the dawn of a new day as he gets up to go to work.

I disagree with those who say that the film challenges your intellect.

The photography in this film is not often remarked upon, but I think each frame of the house interior is a perfectly composed picture of American domesticity. The visuals do not exist for their own sake; often they suggest emotional desolation and solitude. One particular technique simply blew me away: sometimes the screen fades into utter blackness, lasting just a little too long than is common in movies, which is a simple but effective way making us feel the emptiness the characters feel.

In The Bedroom faces a families struggle through tragedy. A married couple, Matt and Ruth Fowler (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) have one child, a 21 year-old son Frank (Nick Stahl) who is about to leave town at summer's end to go back to college. He has a girlfriend, Natalie (Marissa Tomei) who is older, and his mother does not approve. He assures her that it is only ""a summer thing,"" although love is beginning to develop. Natalie has two children and an ex-husband, and during a scuffle, Frank is murdered by Natalie's ex. There is some tension between Frank's parents following his death, for his mother never supported her son's relationship, yet his father did. They must work through their conflict of emotions regarding the murder, and once they do, a plan on how to deal with the tragedy is formed. A plan, that once executed, will shock you, and leave you wondering if their actions were within reason.
This is a film to challenge your intellect, so if you prefer paint-by-number films where everything is laid out for you, then you will not enjoy it. Close attention must be paid to dialogue, and if you read between the lines, there should be no holes left in the plot.
In response to ""A Viewer,"" from Katy, TX, who posted a review on this film: There was no need for the camera angle to stay on the scuffle so the viewer could watch the murder happen. You do not need to see the killer's face to understand his motivation. The motivation is givin through Matt Fowler's explanation of lobster traps to Natalie's son. (He picks up the lobster missing a claw and show's it to the boy. He explains that the section of the trap that stores the lobsters is called ""The Bedroom."" And if you get more than two lobsters in the bedroom, something (like a missing claw) is bound to happen. Any additional questions regarding motivation are cleared up when Matt tells his wife Ruth about the photograph he saw. He speaks of the way Natalie was smiling.) Hope that helped you out.
I highly recommend this film to everyone. The acting is superb, and Todd Field did a wonderful job of directing. A great deal of the plot is revealed through conversations involving certain objects, but if you pay attention, and read between the lines, then you will be able to enjoy the film to the fullest.

1730978,4,B00006953K,"The bad news is that the DVD is hard to use and contains almost no extras.  It took me 8 minutes to figure out how to get the movie to play.  Zero bonus materials.  The good news is that this is an extremely interesting film to watch, very theatrical in its use of blackouts which gives the film the slow deliberate pacing and a sense of life-like gravity to the unfolding events.  I particularly was impressed with the visuals such as focusing on the curtains blowing in the hallway as you hear sounds of conversation happening off frame.  In another shot, you see Matt sitting down on the bed while the camera focuses on the mirror on the wall, almost like you are seeing the reflection of a couple in tragedy.  The visual power of the film repeatedly is emphasized over the dialogue.  In one scene, after the tragedy, Matt (the father) is working on the boat and the boy of the girlfriend comes to the top of the pier and looks down.  Both stare at each other, neither makes a motion of greeting, then the boy bicycles off.  It's a powerful scene, showing how the link between them has dissolved.  In another scene, Ruth (the mother) gets a posthumous letter from a sweepstakes touting that the Frank (the dead son) could be a winner.  We fully understood, in the absence of words.  The climax of the film is similarly understated and undercut, making it seem all the more realistic and lifelike.  The father tells Richard, ""Don't talk.""  As the film ends and the camera pulls back on the early morning scene of the little Maine town, we know that life will go on; and yet for some it will always be different than before.  This is certainly not a film for the action genre set, but it is a thoughtful and powerfully moving portrait of a family beset by the ultimate tragedy.",1031529600,,1778,4.461300309597523

They have a young, college-age son who's having a ""summer fling"" with an older woman (Marisa Tomei), who can't seem to shake her bothersome ex (William Mapother, cousin of Tom Cruise).  When the Fowlers' son is murdered, the parents are distraught, outraged, and eventually point fingers at each other.  The legal system doesn't seem to be much help, either.  The rest of the movie finds both parents struggling to move on, but the memories of their dead son haunt them at every turn.  Saying more will reveal spoilers which I won't mention. Spacek, Wilkinson, and Tomei give intense, career-best performances that richly deserved their Oscar nominations.  I was most impressed by Wilkinson, a British actor who reaches deeply into his New England role.  But the spotlight ultimately belongs to director Todd Field, who sucessfully directed the film which could have easily been a generic made-for-Lifetime TV movie.  ""In the Bedroom"" is a dialogue-driven drama that has minimal action and may be too dry for some tastes.

1730980,2,B00006953K,"""In the Bedroom"" starts out as an interesting movie about a touching relationship between a college student and an older single mom.  Unfortunately, the movie goes into a weird direction.  Instead of being a movie about two very loving parents struggling to accept their son's choice, it becomes a movie about two parents struggling after their son's bizarre death.
Not only is the plot farfetched and at times embarrassingly cheesy but the acting gets worse and worse as the movie progresses.
Marisa Tomei is great as a single mom but Sissy Spasek is horrible as a cold and unforgiving mother and wife. The movie is also extremely misogynistic - it seems that all the negative action is driven by women.  The morale of the story seems that mothers especially single mothers are dangerous. There is even a metaphor comparing single mothers to female lobsters.
""In the Bedroom"" is clearly intended to be as realistic as possible.  However, there are scenes in it so cheesy they make ""Forest Gump"" look like a documentary.
Despite all of my negative feedback I recommend watching this movie since it's anything but boring.  Cinematography is incredibly fresh.  Tomei's performance is amazing (although her role is not that big) and Tom Wilkinson's performance is interesting to watch. Nick Stahl is very good as Spasek and Wilkinson's perfect son, although we don't see much of him either.",1031270400,,1387,5.008695652173913

It follows a couple having to deal with the murder of their son and, big surprise, they each deal with it in different ways, neither of which, at least until toward the blessed end of the movie, is in the least bit interesting. There are long stretches where simply nothing of interest happens. Between the murder, the surprising ""slap"" scene, the inevitable argument between husband and wife trying to place the blame on each other, and the somewhat shocking climax, nothing really happens. Many couples have to deal with the death of a son or daughter, and this movie goes about as you'd expect it to. The one saving grace, to me, is Marisa Tomei, whom I'd watch doing pretty much nothing.

1730982,2,B00006953K,"This movie shows the effect of tragedy on a family and the viewer reels with the pain of the parents of this murdered young man. Their future is gone when their only child dies, and then they must face the fact that his murderer's punishment might be less than they feel he deserves. The raw agony of the parents was perfectly depicted as they tried to just make it through one day at a time.
That part of the movie resonated for me, but then it descended into the pathos of two people in a flawed relationship who could not communicate about their pain and decided to take the law into their own hands. Before they reached this point, they never sought any help. No counseling to try to enunciate their feelings and their fears. Nothing. Nor was the justice system given a chance. I have known parents whose children or loved ones have been tragically taken away, but none have resorted to this kind of action. Come on, folks, this is not the wild wild west, this is present-day civilized Maine. This movie asks us to believe that one murder is more morally ""correct"" than another....that if one murder is committed by a good man for a reasonable reason, it is okay.
Matt, the father of the murdered Frank, wants justice and is egged on, in a sly and subconscious way, by his wife. Now Matt will not only have to live with the pain of his son's death, but with the guilt of his own actions.
This turned into a movie not of redemption or resolution, but pure revenge. It could have been so much more. If the scriptwriter and director wanted the audience to sympathize with these parents and what they did, they lost this viewer. I think that Matt taking justice into his own hands was a despicable act. I also thought that the entire plot/story was pretty bad. There were so many other directions it could have taken, so much ground it could have covered. The script did not convey how the parents really felt nor the depth of their anguish and despair.
I did not dislike this film because it was, as other reviewers have said, dark, slow, lifeless, too long, or predictable. My opinion is based on the message it  conveyed and the lack of any attempt to show that the actions of the parents were flawed.
Marisa Tomei's wonderful performance was the one shining light in this movie.

1730983,5,B00006953K,"This award winning 2001 film is a deep psychological study of a married coupled, played by Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek, and how their relationship is put under a microscope after a sudden act of violence turns their lives upside down.  Many of their conversations and deeply moving scenes take place in their bedroom, and that is where the title comes from.  I cannot say enough good things about their performances. They actually become their characters.  The connections are deep, including love in all its elements and they manage to capture it all.
The story takes place in a small town in Maine where Tom Wilkinson is the doctor and Sissy Spacek directs the high school's choral society.  Their pride and joy is their son, played by Nick Stahl, a college student who's romancing Marisa Tomei.  Problem is that Tomei is slightly older, has two young children, and is not yet divorced from her angry husband, played by William Mapother.  There sure are problems.  But the problems get worse.  After that, the real story unfolds.
It's all very sad then, and some of the parts drag, but rightly so - as the unhappiness and frustration of the impact of the incident escalate.  The cinematography captures the essence of the fishing town perfectly and we even get a glimpse of what life is like for lobster fishermen.  All the actors are excellent and all of the roles demanding.  For a while I could even forget it was a movie and just get into the story, which unfolds slowly, and is more intense than merely telling what happens; it also explores in excruciating detail why things happens.

It's equally easy to see why the film recieved such widespread kudos, thanks in large part to the actors involved.  The crux of the plot is the involvement of Frank Fowler with a local mother of two, who also happens to have a slightly off-kilter spouse hanging around.  You know  from the get-go that violence is going to ensue, though none  of it transpires on screen.  The eventual murder of Fowler drives the remainder of the movie, as his parents examine  their life without their son, as well as co-existing in a  town where his murderer is roaming free.  To say that Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are first-rate would be doing both  of them an unjustice--this film is a master class in  beautifully understated, unaffected acting(no offense to Halle Berry or Denzel Washington, but these two were equally Oscar-worthy). The supporting cast is seamless, with Marisa Tomei turning in possibly her best work to date and Nick Stahl  equally effective as young Frank Fowler.  Granted, the movie does meander some here and there, drawing it out beyond an unnecessary two hours, and the movie-of-the-week ending,though understandable, is a little too derivative for a movie that  for the most part is anything but.

I agree with another reviewer who said this course of action is not believable given what we know about that character.  What was an intense portrait of grief turns into a fairly rudimentary revenge drama.  The film didn't leave me with any burning questions regarding the morality of that act; it just kind of left me with a blank look on my face.
I think the film is a promising debut for Todd Field, but not nearly worthy of the breathless hype and praise surrounding it.  But it could have been a great movie rather than a merely good one if more creativity had been applied to the film's final hour.",1030838400,,990,4.290322580645161
1730993,5,B00006953K,"I hear some (but very few) complaint about this film, which made me write this one.  If you have a keen eye in picking up a good stuff, you will anyway see this masterpiece, but just in case I urge you very strongly to see ""In the Bedroom"" which deserves your money and time.
The film is about ... what?  This is exactly the point the film challenges us.  It starts with a romance in one idyllic summer in Maine, full of bright sunshine and beautiful ocean.  Matt Fawler, a local doctor, and Ruth Fawler, a school teacher, are spending happy time with their son Frank, who is having a love affair with a beautiful wife Natalie (who lives with her son, practically separated with her husband).  It is just a summer thing, nothing serious, Frank thinks.  Though his father Matt shares the view with his son, his mother sees things differently, worrying about her son's behaviors.
Then, a tragedy happens.  Richard, Natalie's abusing husband shows up, and during the fight between him and Frank, the latter is shot by Richard's handgun.  Frank's parents, living in deep grief, know that they are no longer able to live as the way they did, but cannot speak of the fact to each other.  Their wound eventually leads Matt to one decision that should rectify the past.  But will it?
All about the film, the title says prominently: ""Bedroom"" means double ways, as ""trap"" (as in the beginning of the film, Matt explains to his son) and of course, literarily, a bedroom where the film ends.  It is the place no one can get out, nor make noise.  The Fowlers, trapped in this silent room, have to lacerate each other's hearts even before the tragic event happens, and the film, instead of telling their conditions loudly, quietly shows us their loneliness.  You hear often this expression, like, to ""read between the lines,"" but this film is just the instance that requires you to do that.
And to make it possible, two leading actors Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek, true revelation of the film, practically become the tormented characters, displaying what these first-rate players can do at their best.  Also of note is Marissa Tomei, whose career is suffering from decline since her Oscar 10 years ago, as is shown in that terrible ""The Watcher.""  Todd Field may feel proud of extracting the best performance from those players, and he should be.
The film has many virtues, but I only point out one of them, and finish my review.  The film intentionally skips some crucial parts -- the gunshot in case, for example -- and allows us to take multiple views on the events it describes.  The Fawlers are quite unsatisfied with the ""manslaughter"" verdict, which would be possibly given, and we are quite naturally take their view.  But the film cleverly refuses to show the crime scene itself, making the whole situation more unstable and uncomfortable.  After watching the film you might think, ""Are the Fawlers really right?""  Another instance is found in Ruth's claim, who says she sees Richard (who killed her son) hanging around her, torturing her, always and all over the small town.  But the film shows such scenes only once.  How should we take her words?  Or, how should we take the last words she says to her husband in the end of the film?  (This is a key place so I cannot disclose.  Just watch for yourself, and think.)

""In the Bedroom"" is great because it succeeds in making us feel that there are a lot of things going on outside the film.  Without revealing too much, the film shows how an ""ordinary"" people commit something they should not do.  We read many reports on newspaper everyday, telling crimes that we think not so special.  But most probably, those crimes happen as the film depicts, involving many people's lives.  And this subtle touch is the greatest merit of ""In the Bedroom.""

The film goes like ""Sling Blade,"" which has some common territory with ""In the Bedroom.""  They both move slowly, but with reality only the deft hands can make.  If you like this Billy Bob's masterpiece, you will also be fascinated with this one, a rewarding experience for fans of any truthful drama.",1030406400,,4095,4.682517482517483

his first lesson about writing a novel:  you don't include

By doing so, the director of this film leaves in tact the complexity of the various characters.  He does not allow us to be
self-righteous in our judgement of the characters.  In the end none of the characters seems completely without fault.
Due to the minimalism and the beautifully developed characters in this story I find myself wondering what has happened to the various people.

As mother (Spacek) and father (Wilkinson) are left wondering what happened and what to do next, you see them turn away from each other and the lives they knew.  But just as things are beginning to come together for them, Field shifts the picture and you find yourself watching as the mood changes and things change pace until the final climax ending.
Field's cinematograpy was excellent, bringing music and image together perfectly.  Some scenes were shot in such unusual ways--reflections, odd angles, time lapse.  Also his choice of additional actors was superb as they brought the genuine feel of Camden, Maine to the screen.
I would highly recommend this Oscar nominated picture for it's intense drama and incredible acting.",1030060800,,1204,5.2072538860103625
1731000,5,B00006953K,"It is hard to have enough good words to say regarding the level of excellence obvious in every frame of this painstakingly beautifully made drama. As is often the case these days, this work is the result of the efforts of an independent agent, showing how difficult it is to anything worthwhile done from within the confines of the Hollywood success-oriented movie-making monster. With a small budget and world-class actors, this economy-class effort shows that going in under budget doesn't necessarily lead one into mediocrity. Quite the contrary is true here. This movie shines through its poignant portrayal of a family reeling into existential crisis based on the savage murder of a family member, and deals superbly with the incredible range of emotions such an extraordinary event wreaks in its aftermath.

The terrific cast includes Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson, and Marisa Tomei, each of whom was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for the performances rendered here. This is a starkly realistic depiction of life in the raw, and doesn't soft-pedal any aspect of the wrenching personal experience such monumental loss tows in its wake.  All the second-guessing, recriminations and pent-up regrets of a lifetime come pouring out as the characters try to piece together some workable way to go on in the face of the simultaneous feelings of heartache and anger they feel about what has happened, about what they let happen by acts of both commission and omission, about not stepping up to the meaning of events that led up to the tragedy.

Anyone who has dealt with serious loss in life will relate to the film. In fact, the chief criticism I have of the film is that it is entirely too real, too angst-provoking, too intense, so that it is difficult to sit to watch in its entirety for that very fact. One finds oneself squirming in recognition of just how well-etched and carefully characterized each of the principal figures in the drama seems to be, and how the events that transpire all seem to build inescapably toward this most horrible of conclusions. We watch as the events reel into overdrive, the initial spate of shock and denial buckling inexorably under the need to find some fault, to lay some blame, to put some tangible thread of purpose, reason, or rationality underneath what at base seems to be such a totally illogical and absolutely insane act; the passionate murder of one man by another over love gone wrong.

Briefly summarized, this is easily one of the most powerfully realistic and emotionally explosive movies of the last decade. It twists and plucks at your heart strings and then suddenly cuts them out with a blunt instrument, all without the benefit of anesthesia.  It pulls no punches in presenting an unforgettable portrait of a family flailing desperately about in an effort to come to terms with the violent death of one of its members. It is not an easy movie to watch, but is an uncommon movie experience as it deals so honestly with the extremes of emotion associated with the anger, anguish, and loss so common to the human condition. I highly recommend it.",1030060800,,3103,4.891634980988593

The directing is fine, the acting is superb; but the screenplay is fifth-rate, full of cliches and tired old plot moves.  Those who gave this movie 5 stars were obviously not watching this movie but some other movie they were imagining.

1731002,4,B00006953K,"In the Bedroom is one of the absolute best dramatic films I have seen in a looong time.  The story begins with the love affair between a college student home for the summer, Frank, and his older, not-yet-divorced, mother of two girlfriend, Natalie.  Overshadowing their affair is the disapproval of Frank's parents and the violent jealousy of Natalie's husband.
The affair comes to a tragic end when Natalie's husband shoot's Frank dead in a fit of jealous rage.  The film then switches to Frank's parents.  We witness how the loss of their child, especially in such a sudden, violent way, threatens to tear their marriage apart.  We see them struggling to come to terms, to blame each other, to not blame each other, to get justice for their son, and to try appearing normal the whole time.
This movie is not a thriller or a romance.  In the Bedroom is pure, psychological drama.  The story progresses very slowly, but remains fully compelling.  The director's use of long pauses, silences, and hollow sound bring the characters and their emotion right to the viewers' face.  There is little background music.  Instead, the movie is filled with those loud, pregnant silences that seem to mark tragedy in all our lives.
If you like old movies, you may enjoy this film.  If you enjoy superb acting and a total lack of gimmicky plot twists, you will love this film.  I certainly did.
The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars was that there was a total lack of extras on the DVD.  I would love to have seen some commentaries from the director and the actors, some behind the scenes footage would have been nice, too.

This DVD contains no special features, not even the film's trailer(s)! A commentary, or even a short ""making of"" featurette with the director and the actors would have been fascinating, for sure.

The idea of introducing the title in an early conversation about catching lobsters, of using the Balkan a cappella songs to wind through the tale, of addressing a tough subject for most audiences and doing it all with such finesse and aplomb is staggering.

As other reviewers noted, the pacing might seem slow, but it's thoroughly involving. The family dynamics and psychological drama amongst the family members are real and harrowing. ... The film revolves around this death, and the resolution to this conflict is satisfactory, yet haunting and realistic. This is a film in the vein of ""Sweet Hereafter"", the excellent Egoyan film of a few years back. Very well crafted in a spare, minimalistic way. The Dubus short story the film is based on is expanded and improved upon. Acting is subtle and great all around. Sissy Spacek got the Oscar nomination, and deservedly so, but Tom Wilkinson's empathetic performance carries the film. Great filmmaking all around.

1731027,4,B00006953K,"In The Bedroom is a film that may not be for everyone.  It is a drama that hinges on real emotions of real people.  Today, it seems people want explosions, films written with foul language as a basis of the text, and CGI effects.  This film is smarter than any of that.
Nick Stahl (who is amazingly refreshing and believable), a young college student home for the summer, is dating Marisa Tomei, a ""divored"" older woman with two young sons.  Nick claims the relationhsip isn't serious, but both his parents (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) know otherwise.  The girlfriend's ex-husband doesn't want to let her go and he does what he can to push she and the student apart.  I will not tell more of the plot as it could ruin the film for you.  However, I will say that the title refers not to a sexual relationship, as such, but rather an expression that... two males ""in the bedroom"" with one female leads to competition.  What that competition is and does is the subject of this film.
Tom Wilkinson so easily slips into the skin of his character that you will believe that he is playing himself.  This is a real man and you know it.  Spacek goes beyond anything she's done since ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and delivers a triumphant performance.
In the Bedroom does have its faults though.  It's slow.  It's often quite slow.  I really felt like it could have used some more heavy handed editing.  And the editing itself is often disconcerting.  It seems to jump and to be choppy as if the editor were experimenting with a new tool while he did his job.
On the whole the film is really amazing and well written.  As somone who is sick to death of the free flowing cursing and sex in the majority of Hollywood's films, this was refreshing.  It wasn't immune to cursing, but it was certainly not obtrusive.  Also, there was absolutley no nudity and yet the same ""feeling"" was delivered.  I commend the director, writer and cast for delivering a really marvelous film that tells a really great story and does it with elegance and reserve rather than heavy handed pandering to the desires of 13 year olds.",1029715200,,2096,4.541333333333333
1731028,5,B00006953K,"Adapted from the late Andre Dubus' Killings, the storyline isn't exactly foreign but it's Todd Field's superb direction and the stellar cast that brought the movie to live. Deliberately slow pace, it's precisely how Todd Field was able to bring out the characters' emotions in the film.

The tragic death of the Fowler's son left both of them in a broken state. While Matt Fowler pretends that nothing has happened, his wife is grieving hard. Matt goes through a lot of inner struggles unknown to his wife. It was through their violent confrontation that wife played by the wonderful Sissy Spacek realized what really drove her son to his eventual and untimely death. Matt is then cast into a downward spiral when he does something with good ration.

A cautionary tale of coming to terms and reconciliation, both Wilkinson and Spacek played their roles to their best and emotions flowed. Tomei should also be commended for playing a single mother torn between her still in college lover and ex-husband.

Overall, the movie is rather slow-moving and the best scenes are sometimes those without words. Best of 2001!",1029715200,,1113,4.9411764705882355

1731031,5,B00006953K,"An emotionally devastating film that points up just how fragile life really is, and the facility with which one's universe can be turned upside down veritably in the blink of an eye, ""In the Bedroom,"" directed by Todd Field, is an incisive examination of the irreparable psychological damage left in the wake of a tragic event which, in a perfect world, never would have happened.  And it drives home the fact that this is not a perfect world, but a very flawed world in which crime-- especially a crime of passion-- is more than just an existential concept to be pondered, but a very real part of a very real and imperfect world.  It's a discourse on the unthinkable; a meditation on that single moment you so desperately want back in order to change what otherwise will be forevermore irreversible, and finally on the acceptance of a reality that in the end, is unacceptable.  It's a film that explores the parameters of endurance, and seeks an answer to a question for which there is none; in it's place we find a paradox of the human condition, wherein lies a tenet irrefutably conducive to matters of the heart, and beyond any resolution of the intellect.
For Ruth and Matt Fowler (Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson) life is good; they have a comfortable home in a small town in Maine, where she teaches and he has a successful medical practice.  Frank (Nick Stahl), their only child, is working part time as a lobster fisherman, while preparing for college in the fall.  But first, there's a long, hot summer to embrace, and Frank has become involved with an ""older"" woman, Natalie (Marisa Tomei), the mother of two young boys.  And though they are separated, Natalie is not yet divorced from her estranged husband, Richard (William Mapother), which makes for a rather tentative state of affairs-- especially in light of the fact that Richard wants Natalie and his boys back.
For Ruth, her son's involvement with a married woman has become something of a bone of contention, and rightly so; there's a reason that Natalie is no longer with her husband.  Add to that the fact that Ruth is afraid that Frank's infatuation with Natalie may derail his plans for college, and her concerns seem entirely valid.  Matt, however, though concerned about the situation as well, feels Ruth is being overly cautious on Frank's behalf.  His attitude quickly changes, though, when subsequent events transpire that not only vindicate Ruth's worst fears, but take them all past a point of no return.  And for the Fowlers, life will never again be the same.
Todd Field co-wrote this Oscar nominated screenplay with Robert Festinger (adapted from the story by Andre Dubus), and he goes on to deliver a pensive film that is visually poetic and altogether involving.  In the opening frames, Field establishes an idyllic setting against which he proceeds to unleash a story through which, emotionally, he achieves Everest.  Setting a deliberate pace, he subtly explores each phase through which all of those involved must pass following the tragedy, with special focus on Ruth and Matt  And it's a study that goes well beyond the typical rendering of a ""seeking justice in an unjust world"" drama.  In this one, nothing is in black and white; instead, it is gray areas that prevail.  Field sifts through the emotional wreckage of the those involved, contemplating the effects of the event and the psychological implications manifested in each individual's response to it.  He demonstrates a keen insight into human nature, acutely capturing the confusion and that sense of disorientation, that feeling of ""What do I do next?"" desperation suffered by Ruth and Matt, and how it affects their relationship with one another.  Again, Field finds pronounced shades of gray in the very different ways in which the couple copes with and attempts to resolve their own inner conflict and rage, and the lack of communion it engenders between the them.  From the very beginning, he taps into and then maintains that kind of disconcerting tension one feels in the face of uncertainty; that fury born of the inability to resolve that which absolutely must be resolved before one can move on.  It's a matter of attaining closure, and Field clearly indicates how elusive that can be, and the depths to which one must descend in order to find it.
As Ruth, Sissy Spacek gives a memorable performance for which she was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  As embodied by Spacek, Ruth is a quietly confident and obviously domineering presence; a mother who, without question, wants only the best for her son.  As the drama unfolds, Spacek delivers a portrayal steeped in ever-deepening introspection, wherein the anger for which she so desperately needs an outlet is contained and controlled.  And you can feel that inner turmoil coming off of her in waves, even as she attempts to mask it by affecting an aloof manner.  It's a convincing performance, extremely honest and real; one to which many in the audience are going to be able to connect and identify.
Tom Wilkinson was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor-- and deservedly so, as this is arguably the best performance of his career-- for his portrayal of Matt.  There is such a ring of truth in the way he conveys a ""non-acceptant"" acceptance as he seeks the resolution he so desperately needs, for himself as well as Ruth.  It's a moving performance, and like Spacek's, one to which many are going to be able to relate.
Also turning in an exceptional performance (also nominated for an Oscar) is Marisa Tomei.  Even with less screen time, she effectively holds her own with Spacek and Wilkinson.  Personal experience and frame of reference are going to have a lot to do with how ""In the Bedroom"" is received; but on one level or another, it is going to provide a riveting emotional experience for anyone who sees it.",1029628800,,5853,4.844533600802407
1731032,5,B00006953K,"Once again an independent film shows that a good story, insightful directing and inspired acting can outperform the Hollywood giants with their $50 Million budgets.  This film was produced for a scant $1.7 million and garnered five Oscar nominations including best picture.  Writer/Director/Producer Todd Field, who has spent most of his career almost invisibly as an actor, explodes onto the scene on the other side of the camera and serves notice that he is a force to be reckoned with.
The story is powerful and poignant.  It is the story of a family that is shattered by a horrible tragedy and it examines their ordeal as they come to terms with it.  Field's workup is wonderfully done, giving care to assure that we understand and involve ourselves with these characters.  It is a very likeable family, with down to earth people that come across like our closest friends.  This makes their tragedy into our tragedy, so we easily identify with the shearing forces that shred their lives.
Field shows an extreme talent for bringing a stark realism to the screen.  The characters are consistent with their development and exceedingly believable.  The way he frames the shots and his choice of close-ups of inanimate objects is superb, heightening the feeling of being there.  Having spent a good bit of time in New England myself, I noticed that the locations capture much of the feeling of the place.  Even the sounds are more realistic than most films.
After the tragedy occurs, Field casts a suffocating pall over the film as he allows the humanness of his characters to dominate.  Shock and denial are followed by seething resentment and blame.  The characters are seen going robotically through the motions of their daily lives as they attempt to cope with the reality of the heartbreak that has befallen them.  If there is one area where Field errs slightly, it may be here.  He purposely dwells on these scenes to bring the audience to the same level of frustration and anguish as the characters, in an attempt to make us see that the final resolution is inevitable.  However, his pace is overly torturous.  The film bogs down and becomes repetitive during the second act, making the entire film seem much too long.  However, this is more than compensated by the tense and evocative final act.
The acting is riveting.  Tom Wilkinson, Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei were all nominated for Oscars.  December seems to be a lucky month for birthdays in this film, since all four of the leads were born in that month (Wilkinson, 12/12, Spacek, 12/25, Tomei, 12/4 and Stahl, 12/5).
Wilkinson (""The Full Monty"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Patriot"") emerges from the shadow of supporting roles with a compelling performance in the lead.  His sincerity and believability endow his character with an amiable nature.  His anger and grief is contained, yet while he appears impassive, it is clear that the emotional vortex runs deep.  This is a breakout performance for Wilkinson and hopefully will portend larger roles in the future.
For Sissy Spacek, this is her sixth Oscar nomination.  Throughout her career, Spacek has dependably belted out one commanding dramatic performance after another and this is no exception.  This is a somewhat more emotionally repressed character than she usually plays, but she does it beautifully.  When the dam finally breaks and she goes to pieces, it is one of the most intense scenes in the film.
Marisa Tomei may be one of the most underappreciated actors in film today.  After her best supporting Oscar for ""My Cousin Vinny"", one would have expected more leading roles.  They never came and she continued to deliver a parade of terrific supporting roles.  Tomei is a very visceral actor, with great emotional range and the ability to make any character seem lovable.  Here, as Natalie, she pours herself into a confused and broken girl trying desperately to put her life together after her breakup with an abusive husband.  Her romantic scenes are touching and she has numerous heartrending scenes that punctuate the feelings that the other characters are suppressing.  This is a richly textured performance that helps give the film its soul.  Perhaps now, after 20 years in the business Tomei will finally be discovered.
Nick Stahl rounds out the main cast as son Frank Fowler.  Stahl effectively captures the struggle of young adulthood, trying to manage complex adult situations with the inexperience and naivet&eacute; of youth.  William Mapother does a fine job as Natalie's abusive husband.  Mapother's resume is mostly comprised of bit parts in the films of his famous cousin Thomas Mapother (aka Tom Cruise) having appeared in five of them.  However Mapother shows talent of his own in some intense scenes with Tomei and Stahl.  I was impressed how he was able to switch from arrogant intimidation to meek pusillanimity in the final scene with Wilkinson.  It is the perfect portrayal of the bully who is only strong in the face of those weaker than he.
This is a disturbing and powerful film that cuts your heart out and serves it up cold.  There is a thunderhead of new and unheralded talent that converges to create an extraordinary independent film.  Though Field is a bit heavy handed in the second act, everything else is near perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  For lovers of drama and great acting this film is a must see.",1029628800,,5368,4.912319644839068
1731033,5,B00006953K,"""In the Bedroom"" is certainly one of 2001's best movies. It has five great performances, three of which were nominated for Oscars. The script is one of those fine ones in which interesting events are happening on the surface, while even more intriguing ones are going on underneath. Like many movies with great meaning, though, it is not what most people consider entertainment. And I have to admit that this opinion has merit. After all, the terms `meaningful' and `entertaining' are, in many ways, polar opposites. ""In the Bedroom"" is for viewers who, on occasion at least, enjoy a movie that provokes them and causes them to think.
Ruth and Matt Fowler [Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson] live in a small town on the coast of Maine. He's the town doctor, and she's the music teacher at the local high school. In such a place, they are at the top of the social ladder. Their son, Frank [Nick Stahl], is spending the summer at home before going off to graduate school in the fall. He is having an affair with an older woman, Natalie [Marisa Tomei], who has a couple of kids and is in the process of divorcing her rich-kid husband, Richard [William Mapother]. It's anything but an amicable divorce. This fact gives the seeming idyllic love affair an ominous undercurrent, to which Frank seems oblivious.
Ruth objects to the affair for her own reasons. Though Frank insists it's just a summer affair, she senses that her son is in love. She feels that the relationship will jeopardize his future. Matt is supportive of his son for several reasons. He is living vicariously through Frank. More importantly, his relationship with Ruth exists as a shell of what it once was. They don't really like each other anymore and have taken to disagreeing just to disagree. Matt may support his son just because Ruth doesn't. It's a stance he will live to regret.
It's hard to believe that this is director Todd Field's first movie. Prior to this, he was just a relatively successful character actor.
The cast is much better known. Nick Stahl has been acting since he was a small child, although this is easily his most important role. Tom Wilkinson is a very famous character actor in his native England. Sissy Spacek was once a major star. Her Best Actress Oscar was for ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" twenty years ago, and she was nominated four other times between 1977 and 1987. As roles in movies dwindled, she went off and raised a family. She also did a few small movie roles and several TV movies, but I think it's still fair to call ""In the Bedroom"" her comeback. It's her best performance in a long and distinguished career. I hope she's back to stay.
Though some of us like to believe that `it can't happen here', we all know that bad things can and do happen everywhere. This fact is part of what makes ""In the Bedroom"" so disturbing. The Fowlers are such decent, ordinary people living in such a beautiful and peaceful New England town. The horrible event that wrecks their lives is particularly overwhelming to them because nothing in their lives could prepare them for it. The movie reminds us that good and bad are relative terms. It's easy to be a `good' person as long as nothing happens to compel us to become `bad'.",1029542400,,3213,4.648506151142355

In this film dealing with young love, jealous husbands, and parents love for their child, it's the little moments that define it. In a scene where the parents are listening to bad news from their lawyer, the dad isn't looking at him. Instead he's focused on nick-nacks and pictures of the lawyer's family. This is what real people do! A middle-aged woman, a friend of the family, speaks with ""ums"" and doesn't always use words perfectly, just like a lot of real people do! The story is nothing new, the situation told countless times in other films. But here, there is a new spark of life, a spark of reality, which makes this film so enjoyable.
All the actors fit into their roles perfectly. Marissa Tormei in another Oscar-nominated performance is great along with the family portrayal of Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson and Nick Stahl.
A warning for those needing a fast paced film. This isn't for you. It takes its time, like things do in the real world. We need more films like this that are not afraid to take it's time in telling the story. Not every film has to cater to the MTV quick-cut crowd.

I hesitate to say too much about what happens in this film but will note that a murder sets off a chain of events and rocks a marriage to the core.
 Throughout this film, I kept thinking how much the events reflected real life and didn't seem at all artificial or unbelievable, let alone staged. I got the impression that director Todd Field didn't feel compelled to ""explain"" his characters or their motivations.
 If you like films which end in nice, neat conclusions, be forewarned that this movie isn't one of those. Instead, Field throws viewers into the middle of a family which is struggling to stay afloat.

Todd Fields next move has to be as anticipated as Sam Mendes and even more so to those who lean more to the film as art theory. The story follows a middle class Noreastern family through the tragic murder of their only son and the onslaught of overwhelming emotions.
The Wilkinsons are a very real family who are just out to live their lives which dosn't seem much to ask but then that's why the story is a tragedy.  The young son, Frank falls for a divorcee whos violent husband belongs to a prominent family in town and dosn't want to give her up.  Nobody in film here is trying to be a hero in any way and at best Frank is only trying to be noble but the situation does not end well and Fanks parents Ruth and Matt are thrust into what many consider the greatest tragedy of all, burying a child.  Matt (Tom Wilkinson) and Ruth (Sissy Spacek) deal with the situation as best they can which is awkwardly and in near violent spurts.  All actors involved give great performances, especially Spacek who gets the honor of playing one of the best roles for a woman in film in a while.  This film may not suit the average moviegoer with it's long shots of silence and awkward outbursts but this is exactly what makes the film so dynamic and powerful.

Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are at their best with pitch perfect performances as Matt & Ruth Fowler, both recieving Oscar nominations for their work (they should have won!). Marisa Tomei assures the world that her 1992 Best Supporting Oscar Win (""My Cousin Vinny"") was not a fluke. She pulls off the most vital role in this film with ease, handling the multiple emotions of her character like she's been doing it forever.
  ""In the Bedroom"" was nominated for 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. Some may find this film too slow, or boring.

The movie takes place in three parts like a great Russian novel.  The first shows the everyday life of the family, how they interact with each other, and the growing love between Nick Stahl and a much older women, Marisa Tomei.  The second part deals with the family's loss and shows how one painful thing can lead to endless fights, arguments, and showdowns, specificly between Nick Stahl's parents (Brilliantlly played by Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek).  And the Third deals with revenge and many attempts to fill the void of loss.  First time Director Todd Fields has brought us a truly haunting story that shows how grief can turn into anger, anger can turn into hate, and hate can turn into revenge.  Besides being the best film of the year, it is also a showcase for great performances by Tom Wilkinson, Marisa Tomei, and especially Sissy Spacek who left me speechless and inspired for days after I saw this film.  As I brought up in my review of A Beautiful Mind, I felt Russel Crowe was the true Best Actor of the year and was very upset to see him not recieve the Academy Award.  The Same goes for Sissy Spacek in this film.  Her depiction of Ruth Fowler is nothing short of genuis.  She was by far the Best Actress of the year.

The script is incredible and the beauty of the movie lies in its simplicity and near perfect grasp on reality. This movie is true--made solely with diagetic sound (no musical score/only sound natural to the picture).

As you watch this film, you know Frank (Nick Stahl) and Natalie's relationship is genuine, yet fragile and dangerous. The suspense builds slowly and effectively. The ultimate tragedy however pales in comparison to what follows next.
William Mapother and Celia Weston (remember her from the sit-com Alice?) head a strong supporting cast.
You can see the tremendous care Todd Field put in scenic design, shot selection and character development. These people seem so real. I felt like I was intruding upon a true story.

Abruptly, tragedy strikes the small Maine community, throwing the Folwer family into a tailspin.

Todd Field's direction and script follow the characters of Ruth and Matt, not through plot driven elements, but through their own concealed anguish and suffering.  The use of silence is menacing, real emotion and pain are exemplified through stares and deep breaths, giving the film a chilly aura.  Characters are deconstructed and reexamined through their agonizing experience, relationships change and true feelings of jealousy and rage emerge.

1731058,1,B00006953K,"Minority opinion. Why is this a TV viewers' movie? Because every shot says one thing, says it clearly, and says nothing else if it can avoid it. It's as if each scene were drawn in crayon. A TV image has less detail than a 3-cent stamp, so its only duty is to get the message out. The sound matches, so its duty is to be good and clear, and forget realism. Audience attention is shared with the Twinkies, the dog and Debbie Sue who's always on the phone. So, let's not try to walk and chew gum at the same time.
By contrast, a film is meant for an audience of people who give it their full attention, who can scan the whole screen while each scene runs and generate their own feelings according to their own experience, who can react to minor elements in the sound as they would in real life, and who can likewise take in characters onscreen the way they take in living people.
In The Bedroom is built from shots where you can't feel where you are, how old things are, how's the light, what's the time of day, how warm it is - unless that's the purpose of the shot. The acting is delivered with accents that are pure North Hollywood, not northern Maine, and the diction is always good and clear. There is no sound except what you're meant to notice, no atmosphere. Instead, there is double-underline music where ""appropriate"".
Worst of all is the acting and direction. Almost everything is played walk-on style, as in As The World Turns. You mostly don't feel that the characters were doing something before the shot, that they will go on doing it after the shot or that they do what they do during the shot from their own inclination, not because they're paid to keep to the script. Of all the cast, Sissy Spacek gets my nomination for Best Leading Dead Fish, providing a perfect illustration of ""going through the motions"".
By contrast, the Bad Guy, William Mapother, manages to transcend both the direction and the script. You *feel* that, yes, his character is acting from his own inclination, has been doing it for years and will go on the same way once the shot is over. Playing his ex-wife, Marisa Tomei puts in a valiant effort too. Playing her lover, Nick Stahl perhaps tries hard too, but he's swamped by the Dick-and-Jane script and framing he's handed.
As for the story - pure tribalism. Establish Fifth Commandment Transgression scene by stagy scene in first part. Reach First Second Amendment Rite (Bad Guy shoots Young Good Guy dead). Muddle through second part (Bad Guy goes out on bail and moves to another town). Reach Second Second Amendment Rite (Old Good Guy Stand-in for Average Joe shoots Bad Guy very dead). (Less than one ten-thousandth of the US gun deaths that year, in case you wonder.) Real men, almost up to NYPD Blue standards.
What about a counter-example? The Man Who Wasn't There, which works around the same themes. By the criteria above, this is a film, not a TV play writ large.
I get the impression people react to this movie the way the movie *tells* them to react, which is pretty much what I blame it for. But, if you can believe a parish priest in a Maine fishing village, past sixty, sporting a blow-dried hairdo, and if you can believe Sissy Spacek's nose job, then you might like the movie, I don't know.",1017014400,,3249,4.508474576271187
