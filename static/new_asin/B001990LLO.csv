3427160,5,B001990LLO,"Jon-Erik Hexum played a true hero who lived up to the theme song, and he risked his life to be one. In fact when he innocently took his life away his mother made him a die a real-life hero by donating his organs saving lives. This makes him a legend that will live on, and by releasing this series on DVD will promote an important cause. ""Cover Up"" which would have been long-running had a lot of similarities to ""Walker Texas Ranger"" because Jon-Eric Hexum's similar character was predicted to gradually build his relationship with his co-star Jennifer O'Neill a similar love story to ""Walker Texas Ranger."" In fact, ""Walker Texas Ranger"" star Sheree J. Wilson was on the second episode of ""Cover Up"" which was her first TV role.",1305158400,9,730,4.623076923076923
3427161,5,B001990LLO,"In my opinion, this series has been on the shelf or in the vault collecting dust for way, way too long now.  If Universal can bring back Voyagers!,(the first series Jon-Erik Hexum was in) then why can't CBS/FOX (I believe this is who owns the rights to Cover-Up) or whomever owns the rights to it now, do the same?

If you are like me, a fan of the late Jon-Erik Hexum, then you know all too well how important it is to have this series released on DVD.  It's release will not only help save the eyesight of those of us who are still watching jittery, grainy, faded-out VHS copies of the show from the 80's, but also will become a lasting tribute to Jon-Erik whose life and career was cut short way too soon.

So please bring this one back to DVD.  Oh and one other thing.  Please, please don't do it on the cheap like some other companies have done in the past with their DVD sets.  Specifically, I'm referring to the use of double sided dvds to cram as much video as possible onto one disk.  I have several DVD sets which are produced on double sided dvds.  They are a pain to use and scratch way too easily.  Thanks",1294790400,11,1118,4.206572769953052
3427162,5,B001990LLO,"This series had great potential and was very entertaining because of Jon Erik Hexum and Jennifer O' Neil. And I believe it would have been a classic if it had continued.

Its one of the TV gems from the 80's.  Please release it on DVD, any VHS tapings that I've seen are very poor quality.",1293667200,10,289,4.236363636363636
3427163,4,B001990LLO,"Cover Up was such a short-lived show with both leading men having died so young. Jon Erik Hexum as he was starting to shoot the second season and Anthony Hamilton (his replacement) who died in 1986. They both acted well in this series alongside Jennifer O'Neill, but I really think Hexum was the superior actor.

I think if Jon Erik Hexum had lived, the show would have lasted longer. I think in memory of him, this series should be released on DVD. They released Voyagers!!",1280793600,13,474,4.576470588235294
3427164,5,B001990LLO,"Cover Up was a stylish action series with the high fun content typical of eighties TV.  With strong characters and varied storylines and locations, it should have lasted longer, but failing that I would at least like to be able to buy the DVDs: the show deserves to be watched again.",1276128000,11,283,4.549019607843137

3427167,4,B001990LLO,Cover Up was a agent spy series with a model turned photogragher and an special forces green beret teamed up to go on covert operations using modeling and photo shoots as a cover.

3427277,5,B001990LLO,"This was a VERY enjoyable series.  Although it was cut short by the accidental death of Jon-Erik Hexum, I remember it vividly.  I would certainly love to see it on DVD, and would purchase it.",1388275200,,191,4.428571428571429

3427282,5,B001990LLO,"I can't believe this hasn't been released in DVD yet. It was one of my favorites growing up in the 80s. I'm sure there are millions of people around the world who like me remember this show with fondness and would jump at the chance of buying the DVD collection, so whoever owns the rights shouldn't let this business opportunity escape. Nostalgia is a big-buck business, folks!",1370131200,2,378,4.656716417910448
3427283,5,B001990LLO,Stylish & classy.  Much more entertaining than what passes for that in 2013.  PLEASE put me down for an instant purchase if this series ever comes to DVD!,1365120000,,154,4.464285714285714
3427284,5,B001990LLO,"So the premise by today's TV standards - agents, one a former Special Forces agent; the other, a widow of a murdered agent and a photographer taking over his work posing as a model and the photographer to catch all sorts of nefarious bad guys - may seem a bit cheesy and hokey, and maybe it was. But it was also entertaining and a hell of a lot of fun. Not everything has to be dark and serious, and the '80s was the perfect decade for this show.

Of course, there was the well-known tragedy of Jon-Erik Hexum losing his life after a joke with a prop gun on the set went horribly wrong, ending a career of potential much too soon, but his Mac Harper was both boyishly charming and was skillful enough to use his brawn and his brains when the going got rough. Mac's/JEH's replacement, Jack Striker, as played by Antony Hamilton, was also easy on the eyes and showed promise. Ironically, Mr. Hamilton would also die much too soon in 1995 at only 42.

But if one simply concentrates on the eye candy and outlandish but interesting cases and the characters of Dani, Mac, and Jack, as well as Richard Anderson's Henry, their advisor, boss, and friend (no, not MacGuyver, that's Richard DEAN Anderson; the former is best known from ""Bionic Woman"" in the 1970s), it is easy to go back to when TV was about escapism and larger than life.

I would love for this to get an official release if just to honor the work of the two late male leads (and Jennifer O'Neill and the aforementioned Richard Anderson, of course!). I realize the issue of music may be the reason it hasn't been released, but since both the title theme of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" was covered by E.G. Daly and not the original Bonnie Tyler recording - and the other '80s music was also covers with others singing - perhaps something could be worked out? I sincerely hope so. It would be a shame to just have this remain in a vault, collecting dust.

A product of its time or not, this TV time capsule is still enjoyable, even if the events surrounding this series meant it would only last for one season. Please release this series to DVD.",1364688000,2,2098,4.399484536082475
3427285,5,B001990LLO,"I truly loved this series and hope that it comes out on DVD.  There was a lot of humor, action and no one took each other seriously.  Jon-Erik was fabulous and the tribute to him was moving.",1353888000,,190,4.108108108108108
