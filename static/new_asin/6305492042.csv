1037858,5,6305492042,"This is definitely a movie every family should rent and enjoy. This wonderful movie is about innocence, a word America has not heard in a long time. Even on the subject of sex, the movie handles it with care and again,  innocence. With this movie, families with children 8 to 20 yrs old are  given the perfect opportunity to discuss matters such as: true friendships,  love, sex, peer pressure,and most importantly, dealing with people who are  mentally or physically handicap.
Our society does not open their arms to  the mentally handicapped, but this movie suggest that we are missing one of  God's greatest blessings, the ability to love unconditionally.  Go rent the  movie today!!!",937440000,2,687,4.964912280701754

1037861,5,6305492042,"I just watched this movie and I am still smiling about it. It was such a heart warming movie that allowed me to cry and laugh at the same time. It is an excellent perfromance of two very good actors, and I think anyone who  wishes to feel good about people, familes, and the world should watch it.  But that is just one persons thoughts, one who will end up buying this  movie.",936662400,,377,4.136986301369863
1037862,5,6305492042,"This movie tells a beautiful story about a mildly mentally-challenged  girl.  She was born into a well-off family and has two sisters.  Her mother  is semi-controlling in that she wants all of her girls to be well-rounded  young ladies.  Her father is calm but turned to alcohol when things got too  hectic. The movie begins by introducing us to the main character Karla, who  is shown at seven years old having a temper tantrum at the kitchen table.  This is the latest in a long series of disruptions. Her mother feels  helpless in this situation and her father turns to drinking.  Her mother  decides to send Karla to a boarding school; Karla remains there for the  remaining ten years of her adolescence.  The father picks Karla up from  the boarding school and they both return home.  Her mother had prepared her  daughter's arrival by decorating Karla's room and arranging for her to  begin tennis lessons.  One of Karla's sisters is currently planning a  wedding and hopes to become a second grade teacher.  The oldest sister is  hoping to that her mother will accept her lesbian relationship.  During  Karla's birthday party, she announces to the family she would like to  enroll in a technical school to become a veterinary assistant.  The mother  is scared of Karla possibly not succeeding and is not ready to trust her  with independence.  There is a family fight about the Karla's desire for  more independence.  The family decides to give Karla a chance at attending  school. While registering for classes Karla tried to assist Daniel, who was  displaying problems with others passing him up in line.  Daniel is also  mildly mentally challenged, living alone with financial support from his  father, and is attending school.  The movie follows the couple as they  struggle to establish a relationship and a more independent life together.",930268800,,1851,4.928104575163399
1037863,5,6305492042,"For those of us who love the ""feel good"" movies, this is an absolute must to see.  The two main characters are totally believable, and are so without being insulting to people with mental handicaps.  The young  couple, so very in love, firmly attach themselves to your most tender  heartstrings and pluck away.  And, if you ever loved a parade, this movie  might be a ""two-hankie event"" for you!!!",929750400,,397,4.681159420289855

1038415,4,6305492042,"This is going to sound nuts, but there are about three extra minutes on this dvd that weren't on the video.  I don't want to give anything away, but if you've got the video you'll know that ""olive juice"" comes out of nowhere, with no explanation.  The dvd has a three minute conversation at the beginning of the country club scene that explains it, along with an additional somewhat important comment from Heather, and a slightly expanded version of Jeff's speech.

Absolutely no other scene has one second of additional footage.  I can't begin to explain why those three minutes would have been cut out of the video (at least the release I bought).  I can tell you that even when I rented the movie the very first time a million years ago when grocery stores still had video rentals, those three minutes weren't there.

One other note -- for some reason I couldn't get this to fit correctly on my tv.  I finally had to watch the whole thing in that ""normal"" setting so that it was letterboxed on all four sides and tiny.  That could just be me, though.",1487030400,,1053,4.476439790575916

Carla expects to be treated just like any other adult. Her overprotective well-to-do mother, while well-meaning, denies that her daughter is grown up with the same  hopes and intelligence as anyone else. Over and over she disregards Carla's proclamations and aspirations for her future. It always makes me smile when Carla finally confronts and stands up for herself.

A great film holding a strong message about how people's perceptions are often wrong, and the courage and character of a loving human heart. I highly recommend this film.",1469664000,3,816,5.074626865671642

Diane Keaton played a typical controlling mother who would not let up, but Juliette Lewis did not have her way with her concerning her life or her man.....it's a delightful movie I would give this movie ten stars if it were possible!!!!!!",1407715200,,536,4.702127659574468

1039465,5,6305492042,"All of the negative reviewers need to shut up and grow a heart.

This movie is beautiful. The performances of the two leads were sincere and affecting, and even the more annoying characters (like Diane Keaton's overbearing mother character, who I just wanted to bitch-slap after she'd opened her mouth twice) came across as more than just characters on a movie screen. The cast was wonderful, the characters were well-written and well-acted, and it's a film that only gets better with repeated viewing.

I've never been a big Juliette Lewis fan. But she shines as Carla. Having worked in the past with mentally retarded kids, I couldn't help but fall in love with the character's spirit, her drive and determination to be her own person. By the time Carla defiantly tells her mother ""I can LOVE!"" I just wanted to stand up and cheer for her.

Both Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi turn in wonderful performances here -- I didn't feel as though I was watching characters, I felt like these were REAL people who I could relate to. Nothing about them felt contrived; every emotion felt as though it came from the heart. I can't say enough good things about this film.

Ignore all the bad reviews and check it out for yourself. Seems to me that all the nastiness comes from people who seem to think they know absolutely everything about how mentally disabled people act and feel, which is ridiculous. No one can be the definitive authority on how another person feels/acts, and I found the lead characters in the film to be very realistic.

Oh, and the homophobic reviews are just beyond ridiculous. If you think that being who you are is a ""sin,"" then you don't understand anything about this film or the message it's trying to get across.",1407628800,,1729,4.693069306930693

1039590,5,6305492042,"A previous reviewer named this as a movie to buy, not rent. I have to agree. I have no problem sticking this on the shelf with the Godfather trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon, and the original Sweet November (not the unfortunate Charlize Theron remake). What they share is superb acting. While Pacino and Brando's acting have understandably gained much acclaim, I have never ceased to marvel at the performance here of Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi. I am not unfamiliar with mental disability, but was floored by this movie. In fact I had a hard time convincing myself that the two principal were not actually disabled in real life, since at the time I first saw this movie, I was not familiar with either. Well, that is no longer the case; after seeing one or two other Juliette Lewis movies, I admit to an addiction. ImdB calls her ""one of Hollywood's most talented and versatile actors."" Probably an understatement; the girl is a national treasure, and this is one of her exquisitely chosen vehicles that simply makes one proud. Giovanni Ribisi is equally credible here, and the whole package, far from being ""saccharine"" as stated by another review, is a life-affirming story in the truest sense, touched with authenticity, care, and empathy. Maybe I have a weakness for saccharine, but I maintain this as one of my favorite movies ever, and worthy of a top 100 placing in best movies of all time. But then again. I think Sweet November (with Sandy Dennis) was one of the best acted movies of all time, so what do I know?",1396915200,,1521,4.700374531835206

1040151,2,6305492042,"I first saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I was a young teenager. I remembering liking it quite a bit. I recently viewed ""Temple Grandin"", starring Claire Danes, and that got me thinking about this movie. So, years later, I watched it again. ""Temple Grandin"" and ""The Other Sister"" really can't be compared, as they are two entirely different films. ""Temple Grandin"" is a biopic of Temple's life and struggles growing up with Autism. While ""The Other Sister"" is seemingly nothing more than a typical romantic comedy, but featuring developmentally disabled leads as a twist.

After watching ""Temple Grandin"" and this, coupled with the fact that more is now known about Autism and other developmental disabilities, I really found myself question what the intent of this movie might be. As I said, it seems to be nothing more than a twist on a typical rom com. Daniel and Carla's characters are played as stereotypes. And while they do face some struggles, for the most part, it seems like they move through life as easily as the rest of us. Diane Keaton's character was the only one that seemed realistic. Her questioning what she had done wrong and how she often acted with frustration to Carla was much closer to reality. In situations that would probably cause awkwardness at best and dangerous at worst are portrayed as comedic. So, are we laughing at these two kids or with them?

Two stars, because, in the end, it is sort of a heartwarming story, if not at all realistic. It really just depends on how you want to view it.",1364947200,,1541,4.682656826568266

If you are looking for something to make your girfriend think you are sensitive or something, buyer beware. You will not be able to pretend you aren't laughing til you cry.

1040505,4,6305492042,"I completely disagree with the amazon review at the top of the page. There was tension and conflict as the family- the mother in particular, tried to adjust to Carla's newly demanded independence. There are some very deep and touching scenes and the ending always brings me to tears. I think the person who wrote the review in the product description must have missed that. I agree with them however that the acting was superb. Govanni Risibi and Juliette Lewis give an extremely convincing performance which made you think twice about those we might usually dismiss. Diane Keaton is also one of my favorite actresses and shines as the quintessential charming and good-graced, albeit uptight mother. Essentially- the main message of the film is that special needs people think and feel the exact same things in romantic relationships. The boy-girl interractions between Carla are humourous just for the fact that they are so typical of male-female relations. Point: special needs or not- men will piss you off! Joke (I'm a woman). No, but seriously. Gary Marshall always delivers (Beaches, Pretty Woman, a League of Their Own- Penny Marshall)and this is no exception (you've even got a few extras who were in Pretty Woman starring in minor roles in this movie too). I like the fact that the usual themes that you would expect to find in dysfunctional upper-class families are also touched upon without it becoming too heavy. Additionally- the fact that the public school in the Bay area is actually portrayed with the type of people you would expect to find in a public school in the area. The makers did try to include some diversity- which is a plus for me. Good movie.",1313107200,,1671,4.866666666666666

1040586,5,6305492042,The Other Sister is a delightful DVD about people who are somewhat limited in their abilities to take care of themselves.

Carla finds a boyfriend, Daniel or Danny (Giovanni Ribisi), who also has a developmental disability. The movie tells a story of family dynamics. The father tries to keep a balance in the family and show each of his daughters that he loves them despite their choices or abilities. The mother attempts to maintain control over things to which she cannot control. She has a desire to maintain a perfect picture to the rest of the upper class society, but alienates her daughters in the meantime. The oldest daughter is gay and feels like an outcast when she comes home to visit. She is not able to bring her partner home for the holidays or for special occasions, and the family is not supposed to mention the fact that she is gay to the other members of society. The middle daughter obtained a college degree, but the mother is not satisfied with her choice to ""just"" be a second grade teacher. Her mother would feel more proud to be able to brag that her daughter was a professor at a university. Carla seems to cause problems in the home. At a young age her mother sent her off to school for ten years. When Carla returns, at age seventeen, she tries to let her mother know that she can make decisions and would like to live life out from under her mother's overbearing control.

With Tom Skerritt never more likable and Diane Keaton never more annoying(on purpose)this story of a young retarded women's determination to be independent is sometimes funny, insightful and heartbreaking! More importantly than her independence is her need to get from under her mother's thumb. She finds a friend in Giovanni Ribisi's character of Daniel and the two fall in love.

1040752,5,6305492042,"I first saw this movie several years ago, and I was quite impressed with it. Recently, I saw it several times on cable and knew that I absolutely had to own the DVD. This is one of those movies that I never tire of watching, especially when my heart needs a little comforting and warmth.

I think Juliette Lewis is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood, and she did a fabulous job of portraying a mentally-challenged woman. So many movies out there seem to focus on the limitations of handicapped people, but it was obvious that her character ""Carla"" had more potential and opportunities than Carla's parents' wildest dreams.

Every family has its own set of issues and challenges, and it was quite inspiring to see Carla and her family struggle through different issues (e.g. Carla getting a boyfriend). In a poignant fashion, the movie takes the viewer through a transition of all the adult children leaving the nest once and for all. I liked the fact that the family's problems were not solely centered around Carla's life.

A young woman challenged yet undefeated in her lust for life and love, a family changing and growing along the unrelenting wave of time...this movie is surely a classic that never fails to touch your heart!",1173916800,,1246,4.7592592592592595
1040753,4,6305492042,The movie The Other Sister- is a captivating tale of a young women trying to break free. Diane Keaton does a wonderful job as the over protective mum- who insists on controlling the young women due to her mental issues (she is mildly challenged). I would suggests this movie for anyone who knows what it feels like to be held down or placed on a leash- only allowing you to spread your wings so far. Julliette Lewis and Giovinni Ribisi do a magnificent job as lovers in the film.,1167782400,2,479,4.393258426966292
1040754,5,6305492042,"I remember seeing this move come to the big screen and noticed that Juliet Lewis was in it. I love her performance a great deal. Well tonight I finally got a chance to see this heart warming movie on DVD. I am a huge fan of Keaton as well. His performance here is unique and vast. She will always amaze me in her acting if it is from movies like Crimes of the Heart to The First Wives Club, Father of the Bride, even Baby boom. She will forever be an amazing talent woman, of acting in my book. I saw Lewis for the first time in The Evening Star yet another fine film that is a sequel Terms of Endearment. This move is well directed and well paced as well. I was about give up on it about 45 min into the move talking about the story line. But I was so trapped with Keaton's performance that I gave it a chance. I am glad I did. The story came around in more ways than one. It is a beautiful love story about two special people that fall in love and are given a hard time form people around them (e.g. Keaton the mother). Her role as a mother of three daughters tends to be over protecting. She wants to run their lives as she sees fit, not to what makes them happy. It is a test of emotional fitness between Keaton and Lewis (mother and daughter) that makes it worth seeing. The performance of Ribisi presented here is amazing too. The chemistry between Lewis and Ribisi are very special that keeps the warmth in this movie alive. The Other Sister will warm your heart, make you laugh and bring tears of joy to your eyes. This is a must have to anybody's DVD collection.",1150502400,4,1571,4.137254901960785
1040832,4,6305492042,"I was blown away by the wonderful acting of Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi who played the retarded young adults. This was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability. Disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else. It was wonderful to see the love ""Carla""'s siblings and parents had for her. There were 2 reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars. One was that Diane Keaton's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying. Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't love this film was because Hollywood once again tried to push us into accepting homosexuality as normal and good. Sorry, Hollywood, but there will always be those of us who still believe God's word to be true. Homosexual partnership isn't considered normal or ok in the bible. God never created it. Look it up. You are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle.",1145318400,3,1097,4.71875

Here's another Hollywood star trying to earn their Academy Award by portraying a person with a mental handicap."" But, because I'm taking a Special Education class, I did watch the film at last and I found it to be very moving and funny.  Lewis and Ribisi do excellent jobs with their parts, making their characters sympathetic and realistic, never veering off into quirky for the sake of quirk or into stereotyping.  You laugh a lot during the film and cry more than once and feel like you've experienced something worthwhile when the credits finally role. If there's anything that keeps me from giving it five stars, it's more due to the directing and the script which tend to be a little sappy, a little heavy handed at times, and sometimes you feel like the characters speak not so much what and how they would, but what the screenwriter is thinking, things that could be gotten across with less words and more indirectly, subtly. Still, because they have two great actors in the leads, this doesn't intrude too much with the storytelling and the emotional impact.",1141516800,3,1172,4.763546798029557

1040837,2,6305492042,"Julliette Lewis is a great actress with a great rawness and realness and on the surface may have seemed a great choice for this role but this role didn't seem to be the right choice for her.  This film was hard to watch.  Intellectual Disability isn't a set of behaviours, its a set of perceptions, a way of processing information.  When a non-disabled actor steps into such a role, they have to really get to grips with this or the disability they are portraying seems 'clad' onto them, unconvincing, inconsistent and to those who have these disabilities and their families, the performance can seem patronising.  Whilst The Other Sister set out with great intentions, to draw attention to the equal need for relationship and sexuality of a person with an intellectual disability, the performance itself was a let down.  Hoffman in Rain Man did a remarkable job.  Penn in I Am Sam did a great acting job but the focus of the film seemed more on disability than the person with it.  Here there was a great focus on personhood and equality but the acting didn't carry as the awareness of the internal experience of intellectual disability didn't seem there and came over as a set of behaviours instead.",1128297600,2,1201,4.717703349282297

1040839,3,6305492042,"The acting carries the day in this one.  Juliette Lewis is fascinating to watch as a mentally challenged young woman trying to establish her independence from her wealthy family (especially her overly protective mother, well played by Diane Keaton).  Tom Skerritt turns in a fine performance as the young woman's equally concerned but ultimately more supportive dad.  Throw in a touching performance by Giovanni Ribisi as a similarly mentally challenged suitor, and you've got the 'feel good' movie of whatever year it is that you happen to see it in.

Many critics have found the film's portrayal of the mentally challenged a bit condescending.  There may be some validity to that criticism--after all, these two young people are really quite articulate given their condition.  But that's the point here.  These are high functioning individuals who can reach full potential given half a chance.  More challenged individuals may never reach this level of independence and may never be able to accept full responsibility for their lives (e.g. or to marry as two leads in this film do).  But many can and they deserve the right to pursue thier happiness in their way and to the best of their abilities.

So the film's message is a good one and the acting is solid throughout.  Diane Keaton as the conflicted mom is particularly impressive.  She is not just a shrew.  She is a concerned and loving parent who has a lot of baggage of her own to overcome.  (She is also troubled by another daughter's lesbian relationship, and ultimately overcomes some of her prejudices on that score as well.)  Why doesn't the film achieve something like greatness?  The answers are many and varied.

While it's true that the movie is sweet, and not overly sentimental, it's just sentimental enough to bring it down a couple of notches (or a couple of stars) in my estimation.  We know that everything is going to work out just fine in the end.  Juliette Lewis' Carla just radiates resiliency, and the spirit is contagious enough to bring out the best in all around her.  So there's a predictablility problem there.  And what isn't predictable is often just too heavy handed.  Ribisi's drunken public profession of love (and admission of ""doing it"") at a country club celebration--followed by his interruption of Carla's sister's wedding, to effectively do the same, is all just a little too much.

There are even more fundamental problems. The film's choppy editing makes for poor pacing too.  The subplots aren't given nearly enough time to develop.  The gay sister's life and the complications that brings to the family deserved more attention.  As a plot device, it's just one more thing the family has to deal with and one more prejudice the mother, in particular, has to overcome.  We also learn, in the context of one of the parents many arguments, that the hubby once had a drinking problem.  But after that one mention, that potentially interesting subplot gets dropped too.

And does it make any sense that Carla was apparently tucked away in a special school a few hundred miles away from the family's San Francisco home, and went for years without much visititation from her family members, only to be fully integrated into the family once again upon her completion of that program?  If that were the case, there would likely be a lot more anger on Carla's part than there seems to be.  Is she basically so sweet natured that that neglect is something she can ignore.  Hard to believe that any child would accept that.

Ultimately, the acting becomes the film's saving grace.  Juliette Lewis did not receive an Oscar nomination for her role in this film--strange considering the Acacemy's prediliction for films about the handicapped.  Maybe it's because of the Academy's relative bias against younger actors. Or maybe it's because it was a Garry Marshall comedy, not a Jim Sheridan drama.  Whatever the case, this admittedly flawed film is still worth watching--for Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi and just about everyone else in the cast.  Well worth checking out.

Carla (Juliette Lewis) is a wealthy mentally handicapped person who comes home after attending a special school for many years. Just as she arrives at home her mother (played by Diane Keaton) wants her to play tennis and do certain things, which Carla automatically objects to. She goes to school, and meets a mentally handicapped young man named Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi). Carla learns a lot from Daniel and a friendship grows between the two. She learns that he lives on his own, so she decides she wants to get her own apartment, to the chagrin of her mother. Carla and Daniel decide to deepen their friendship into a loving relationship. The movie was well done, they played every beat in the story, how it affected the family.

The family setup is well paced with the skills of Diane Keaton and Tom Skerritt et al and other issues confronting the modern traditional family are certainly touched upon - obsession with public appearances, coping with a challenged child, teaching sex education, the presence of a gay sibling, to mention only a few.  But it is the overwhelmingly fine performances by Lewis and Ribisi that are of the quality of commitment that seeing them on repeated viewings just fortifies the brilliance of their acting.  These two people are people we readily love and grow to feel their fears, pain, frustration, and dreams.

Carla is very strong minded and wants to take classes at a local vocational school, move into her own apartment, and live a life of her own away from her family. She gets along with most of her family really well but is often in conflict with her controlling and demanding mother (Diane Keaton). While taking classes Carla meets a mentally challenged young man, Daniel (Giovani Ribisi) and the two quickly become good friends and eventually become romantic, a relationship which Carla's mother does not approve.
I was pleasantly surprised by THE OTHER SISTER. I knew before hand that it was a ""chick flick"" and was directed by Garry Marshall. However, for the most part the movie worked. The acting was wonderful. The family struggles were lifelike. The simple adventures of Carla and Danny were rather believable, but Danny's more so because not many mentally handicapped people come from wealthy families like Carla's. Some of the scenes were quite humorous and some were rather touching, evoking real emotion.
There are only two major complaints about the film. One, it was incredibly long (about 135 minutes). At points the movie was dragged out much too long and in those places the film lost some of it's poignancy. My only other complaint is that the film used THE GRADUATE throughout as a prop. I realize that often movies are influenced by other films and sometimes those films are even referenced and parts of them copied in another movie.

I cried, i laughed, this movie touched me so bad i decided to totally change my point of view about mentally challenged people, and i htink i may even go and volunteer in the Israeli retard organisation... This movie totally changed my point of view about these special people, and even about myself- it showed me they and WE can do anything we like if we really want to.

As a beginning actress i know how hard it is to play mentally handicaped peoples' roles, and he did it just perfectly! He had it all: the talking, stummering, walking, eye movements, facial expressions, even the way he laughed was a little innocent child's laughter.

He deserves and Oscar, and the guys who sit up there and give this award to all thouse boring actors and movies- you better open your eyes, because i've followed Giovanni Riisi for a LOOONG time now, and i'm talking about an actor who never gave a performance that was less then excellent, so come on!!!

1041051,5,6305492042,"While watching this movie, my emotions were running crazy.  I was sad, mad, happy, etc.  I have worked with people who were mentally retarded.  I was deeply touched by this movie.
I liked how the producers made the  movie, the entire family has some type of problem.  The father used to  drink (heavy), the mother is obessed with trying to have a  ""picture-perfect-Kodak-moment family"", one daughter is gay, etc.  The movie shows that even with money there are problems.  I felt the movie  could have went deeper in terms of showing how hateful people can be toward  people with mental retardation.  I mean a little more should/would have  happened to Danny in real life at a public school, than just having gum in  his helmet.  Also, while I liked the characters, I would have liked to see  Danny & Carla, with more facial features that the public (non-mental  health professionals) associate with mental retardation, such as a  ""Down's Syndrome"" type of look.  Danny might have dressed  differently, since his income was different than Carla's. Danny's  ""drinking"" problem was never ""handled"", I assume it  just got better?  This was unrealistic, since Danny says ""I like to  drink"".  It would have been nice for Danny to go to some type of  treatment program and ""pass"" it, showing that he could pass  ""something"" (since he failed most of his attempts to do anything  else) and it would show that Danny is trying to be a man of good character.  (This part could have been left out totally).
The wedding of Carla and  Danny was the best part of the show, I cried.  It was so nice to see two  people who love each other get married and be determined to fight the odds.  Actually this is what ""marriage"" was/is supposed to be about  anyway.
Diane Keaton gives a wonderful performance.  While Ms. Keaton may  appear to be ""mean"".  She is actually concerned and scared for  her daughter.  Letting go is always tough, she has one daughter that is  getting married, one daughter that is gay (and she is dealing with the  issues of that) and one daughter that has mental retardation.  Ms. Keaton's  character has a lot on her plate to deal with, not to mention the  relationship with her husband and all the pressures of being  ""well-to-do"".  Ms. Keaton plays a type of person the general  public (non-mental health professionals) can relate to.  But there is a  change in Ms. Keaton's character and she does  ""turn-the-other-cheek"" if you will.  She begins to see (what  others need to see), that her daughter, Carla, despite mental retardation  is a PERSON, and is capable of making her own decisions (or at least most  of them) and leading a normal life, including marriage (which is what  almost every mother wants for her daughter).
The father was a little too  passive for me.  I could tell he loves Carla, but I think it would have  been more interesting if more conflict were shown between him and Ms.  Keaton (one of my favorite actors).
The two sisters were wonderful with  Carla.  The conflicts between the sisters were with their mother.  It is  interesting all three sisters had problems with their mother in some way or  another, this also makes Carla more of a central player---------she is not  a problem----her mother is a problem to almost everyone in the house at  some time or other.
Everyone overlooked the housekeeper, Winnie.  Who is  very supportive of Carla and who Carla shows more affection and attention  to when she arrives home from school the first time.  Winnie is very  patient.  The ""food pack"" Winnie sends home with Carla to share  with Danny is very nice.  But another question, why wasn't Danny invited to  the family dinner?
It was impressive how Danny and Carla planned their  wedding and paid for it with their own funds.
Another minor problem, I  was surprised not to see Danny's father at the wedding?  However, I do  remember that Danny's father hung up during a telephone conversation with  Danny.
I would have also liked to have seen Danny ""struggle""  more.  Let the public or general viewer see what is like to be mentally  retarded and try to get a job or find a new house/apartment.  It was a  little unrealistic for Danny to travel back to see Carla from his train  ride by dangerously hitchhiking back.  I was really concerned for this  safety.
All and all I felt this movie was wonderful.  Diane Keaton is  wonderful, as are all of the other members of this wonderful cast.  Ms.  Keaton's expressions and behaviors are similar to someone who has not been  around mentally retarded persons.  Wonderful.  I would recommend it highly.  I would also recommend it to professionals that work in the mental health  field, it's a must-have.",956188800,15,4679,4.72875
1041052,4,6305492042,"This movie is so sweet, sad, and funny and dramatic all rolled up in one.

1041053,4,6305492042,"The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it.  As a special education major, I was touched by it's reality and bluntness.  Some say that it was sugar-coated, but my peers and I feel that this movie speaks to  us.  The time that Carla runs away from home back to the boarding school is  a testament to the way that she feels at home, that it is not a home.  When  Carla helps Danny at registration, you know she is a caring person who will  survive in this world.  She is ready to become independent and that is the  best thing for her. I applaud the director, writers and Diane Keaton, for  her role as an overprotective mother, which most mothers are, especially if  they are a parent of a mentally-challenged child.  The movie showed the  benefits Carla has and Danny does not.  This movie is a very good way to  gently introduce people to the mentally-challenged population.",954806400,5,888,4.388888888888889

1041109,2,6305492042,"One can't help feeling like a heel for dissing, however slightly, a story about sweet and gutsy mentally challenged people.  However, I came away from ""The Other Sister"" with the vague feeling the Garry  Marshall, however unintentionally, has exploited the very subjects he means  to elevate, all in the name of popular entertainment.  I applaud the  standout leads, Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi, who both give  convincing and humanizing performances as Carla and Danny, a pair of  mentally-challenged young people who fall in love.  The bubbly soundtrack  and lovely exterior shots of San Francisco complement the story well.  However, it seems that Marshall is uncertain whether he is making a  uplifting romantic comedy or a treatise on family dysfunction in the 90s.  The movie veers uncomfortably between these two extremes, sometimes with  jarring results.  Because of the subject matter, Marshall seems to feel  that he must present a socially ""significant"" piece, and throws  in enough family trauma to fuel an entire season of both ""Jenny  Jones"" AND ""Montell"".  I don't deny that a disabled child is  a source of great strain on a family, but the characters Marshall presents  us with are little more than a set of cardboard, ultimately insulting  stereotypes.  Diane Keaton, teetering on the edge of self-parody, plays  Carla's overbearing and high-strung socialite mother, a clothes horse who  cannot come to terms with the fact that her youngest daughter will never be  Deb of the Year.  Tom Skerritt is more sympathetic as Carla's loving but  ineffectual father, a recovering alcoholic who is wracked by guilt over his  daughter and his inability to stand up to his domineering wife.  Throw in  two spoiled and self-involved ""normal"" sisters, one of whom  further overloads the already over-burdened storyline by insisting that her  family accept her lesbian companion, the disintigrating marriage of Carla's  parents, and Danny's burgeoning alcohol problem and own family troubles,  and you have one colossal stewpot of pain and misery.
The film really  shines in its lighter moments. When Carla gets a disasterous makeover at  the mall, or when she and Danny discuss initiating a sexual relationship,  Marshall displays the light touch that made ""Pretty Woman"" such a  hit.  But too much of ""The Other Sister"" feels like a failed  attempt at family therapy.  Imagine if Marshall had let us see the dark  side of his hooker heroine Vivian Ward's life in ""Pretty  Woman""--beatings by her pimp, nights in the county lockup, visits to  the STD clinic and so on.  You get the idea.  Somewhere in this unfocused  heap of pain, ""Other Sister"" houses a comedy gem.  It's just  really hard to find.  I'm not suggesting that the plight of people like  Carla and Danny is laughable, far from it.  Just that Marshall tries to  show us too much, and would have done better to err on the side of humor.  All too often, I felt I was watching a glorified TV Movie of the Week,  albeit with outstanding production values.  By the time Carla has her dream  wedding at the end, we are past caring, since it all rings so false and  overwrought.  However, Lewis and Ribisi keep you watching.  Despite all the  Sturm and Drang going on around them, Carla and Danny transcend their  handicaps, and come off as more grounded than the so-called  ""normal"" people in their lives.  Look for Marshall favorite  Hector Elizondo in a small role as a musician that befriends the beleagered  couple.
""The Other Sister"" is a pleasant enough video  evening.  Pop plenty of popcorn, so the crunching will distract you from  the story's many implausibilities.  Whether you are expecting a  light-hearted romantic comedy, or a serious topical film on mental  retardation, you will be vaguely disappointed, but it's worth one go round.",950054400,4,3818,5.02411575562701

1041112,4,6305492042,"I have seen many reviews here already, so I will stick to what others haven't already said.  For those who think this is drivel or offensive, I can say it is most poignant.  I am buying it and my sister is buying it as  a case study and therapy tool.
It helps us understand our Mom who had  seven children, one of whom is severely retarded from menengitis as a baby,  and one of whom is gay (both also women).  It helps us understand how  challenging it is for our Mom to overcome natural instincts to be over  protective of our retarded sister.  Also, natural feelings of embarassment  toward both the retarded child and the gay child, which the mom hold's back  with great effort.  While this movie was about the sister, much can be  learned about Mom's and their special challenges and limitations.
The  film's unrealistic portions involved the Dad and the straight sister.  The  straight sister would probably have freaked out about her wedding being  ruined.  The Dad would have been worse at dealing with all of this than the  Mom.  But, I expect these two roles were downplayed and plasticised to make  the others stand out.
For those of you who feel real life is not  represented here, I can tell you that you are wrong.  Outcomes and day to  day experiences may not be broadly represented, but the issues were clearly  addressed with many of the true emotions experienced by family members.
The gay friend coming/not coming to events, the retarded person  disrupting, sometimes comicly - sometimes with hysterical outbursts,  anything and everthing that happens in the family.  This is all very, very  real.  The ability of the retarded woman to be more caring and  understanding of the gay sister than the Mom was right on target.
