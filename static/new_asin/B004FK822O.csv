A lot of videos on the market are full of 10 minutes of talking for each technique and then show the same technique over and over.  Xande's set is straight to the point; technique name, a description of when applicable, and then a couple of demonstrations.  And it all flows together into a complete game.  The open guard techniques are really good.  There are five discs including:  Guard/Takedowns, Back/Mount/Side Control positional controls, Submissions, Guard Passing, and Defense/Ginastica Natural.  Each disc is packed with a thesaurus of the best techniques. For example, the Defense section shows the best escapes for Back, Mount, Side Control, etc.",1391990400,,785,5.32520325203252

Seems to have if not all then most of the techniques in the book and then many many more.  I love Xandes breakdown of all the techniques.  He isn't hard at all to understand.  There is tons of technique on the video as well as a segment on gimnastica natural.  All levels of technique from Beginner to advanced .  There isn't any feeling that your appetite wasn't' satisfied.  Anybody can benefit from the video from white to black. Thank God for blu ray format beause if it was on dvd there would be a lot of them.  There is a ton of technique on this set.  One thing that pisses me off when I buy a instructional is to get all excited about the amount of chapters on a disk then by the time i'm on chapter four its just been the same technique repeated from four different angles or from some small slight change of detail.  If theres 12 chapters on the dvd then I want 12 separate techniques.  Not 4 techniques repeated 4 different ways. I've felt robbed a few times after spending over 100 bucks on instructional but not at all with Xande.  Xande is at the highest level of competition and I don't think he tries to keep secrets.  He wants you to understand the movement of the human body in general as well as the mental chess game.  Each volume is as follows. Guard, Guard passing, Mount, Back , Takedowns, Side Control, Submissions, Defense.  Worried you're only going to get to see submissions on the submission volume? Nah its in there throughout all volumes as well as defending them.  Even after all the books that have come out since the original Renzo and Royler Gracie Theory and technique of Brazilian Jiu jitsu, i still think that it is the best by layout and simplicity.  I think that Xande Ribeiros instructional should be the foundation of any instructional library.  Whether you are an elite competitor, mma enthusiast, beginner in jiu jitsu or any grappling art, or have a ton of instructionals, or don't have any at all and are looking for your first.  You can't go wrong with this one in any way shape or form.  Now go train! Or at least watch this one and then go train!",1343347200,,2264,4.511056511056511
