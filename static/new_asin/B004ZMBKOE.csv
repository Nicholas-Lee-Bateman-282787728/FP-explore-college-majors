4510447,4,B004ZMBKOE,"I have a special affection for MIRANDA.

When I was a college freshman at the University of Washington Drama Department, we presented a production of Peter Blackmore's stage play at the Penthouse Theatre, and I did the role of the chauffeur, played in the movie by David Tomlinson.

Miranda, played by Glynis Johns, is a mermaid, caught on a fishing trip by a successful London doctor (Griffith Jones), who immediately falls for her seductive charms.  Concealing the fact that she has a fish tail instead of legs, the doctor brings Miranda home, telling his wife (Googie Withers) and others that the girl is an invalid who needs his personal attention.

For the next several weeks, Miranda, who eats only raw fish, not only devours all the goldfish in the doctor's home, but she also captures the hearts of every male that enters the flat, all of which makes the doctor's wife very suspicious.

Directed by Ken Annakin fro a screenplay by playwright Blackmore and Denis Waldock, MIRANDA remains an amusing comedy fantasy.  However, I do think this material works better in its one-set stage origins, primarily because filmmaker's efforts to ""open up"" the play has muted its natural flow and made the story somewhat choppy and episodic.

4510468,3,B004ZMBKOE,"I did not expect much from this film but was pleasantly surprised.  There are a few familiar faces.  The mermaid, Miranda, is played by Glynis Johns (Mrs. Banks in Mary Poppins).  Johns is very charming as a lonely mermaid, looking for some fun and companionship.  Her nurse is played by Margaret Rutherford (Miss Marple in a few of the Agatha Christie adaptations).  Dr. & Mrs. Martin's butler is played by David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins).  The story reminds me a little of ""The Sea Lady"" by H.G. Wells and also seems to be loosely based on another short story, called ""The Mermaid of Zennor"" by Lyonnese (from the book Among the Mermaids: Facts, Myths, and Enchantments from the Sirens of the Sea).

Miranda wants to experience life on land.  She wants to wear human clothes, go to the opera, visit the zoo, and most importantly meet men.  She flirts with three different men and almost receives marriage proposals from two of them.

Even though she flirts non-stop,  she's still a likeable character and even the women attached to the three men seem to like her despite their suspicions.  There are some cute moments and in the end we are left with a bit of a mystery.

The tail actually looks good, considering the era, and her swimming isn't bad (for the most part) but we only get to see her in mermaid form for the first few minutes of the movie and very briefly at the end.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a light comedy or any mermaid enthusiast.

Also check out the sequel, ""Mad about Men.""",1388102400,6,1520,4.557195571955719
4510469,5,B004ZMBKOE,Loved this movie as a child - 50+ years ago. Brought back happy memories of a simpler time. Amazon's service and promptness was pretty good too,1386806400,,143,4.538461538461538

4510471,5,B004ZMBKOE,I loved this movie.  It was nearly clean of smut and had a wacky story line.  Margaret Rutherford is a favorite of my nephew's which is why we watched this.  It's one we'll probably watch again.  I love good stories and this was one of them.,1376352000,5,241,4.173913043478261
4510472,4,B004ZMBKOE,This movie was great & creative. Glynnis Johns is very good as playing Miranda the mermaid. Liked the rest of the cast as well. I consider this to one of the classic movies out there.,1374278400,,183,4.257142857142857
4510473,4,B004ZMBKOE,"This delightful screen version of Peter Blackmore's play, MIRANDA sparkles with the lovely Glynis Johns as the titular heroine, a mermaid who ventures onto dry land and proceeds to romance every man who crosses her path.

When Dr. Paul Martin (Griffith Jones) goes on a fishing expedition he winds up hooking Miranda Trewella (Glynis Johns), an adventurous mermaid who asks Paul to take her back to London as a houseguest.  Disguised as an invalid, Miranda enjoys madcap adventures with several male admirers (including Paul's chauffeur Charles, played by David Tomlinson), but when Miranda's antics start to cause ripples in Paul's marriage to wife Claire (Googie Withers), can the love-crazy mermaid set things right again?

This daffy charmer has been an audience favourite ever since it was released in 1948.  Much of it's appeal lies with Glynis Johns and her well-honed comedic performance as the mermaid (coloured with some subtle shades of melancholy, which is lovely).  ""Mary Poppins"" fans will get a kick out of seeing 'Mr. and Mrs. Banks' (Ms Johns and David Tomlinson) in this earlier pairing too.  The film is spiced with some frank sexual innuendo - including an eyebrow-raising final scene that I'm surprised managed to fly under the radar of the censors!  Perhaps the English weren't as prudish as their American cousins in regards to the Production Code in the 1940s.

MIRANDA co-stars the delicious Margaret Rutherford as the dotty nurse hired to look after Miranda during her land sojourn - she'd be the only cast member, aside from Ms Johns, to also appear in the 1954 sequel ""Mad About Men"", which is arguably even more enjoyable than the original.  When will that movie be released on R1 DVD?",1369872000,6,1714,5.028268551236749
4510474,4,B004ZMBKOE,"I actually thought I was getting the sequal, ""Mad About Men"".  Thought the title had been changed.  Was delighted to know there was a movie before ""Mad About Men"" because it answered lots of questions.  Thanks.  Now hoping you will one day supply me with a ""Mad About Men"" CD.",1362441600,,276,4.46
4510475,4,B004ZMBKOE,"Glynis Johns shines as the determined and romantic mermaid in this jewel of post-war British comedy. What the film lacks in production values it more than makes up for with the acting of the cast, notably Dame Margaret Rutherford as Miranda's devoted and delightfully daffy nurse. The film presents a satirical take on the British class system as Miranda enchants and manipulates men from all classes of society. An interesting note, David Tomlinson, who plays the enraptured chauffer, later starred as Johns' husband in Disney's Mary Poppins. A sign of things to come, as soon as Glynis Johns Miranda changes scenes from water to land her hair is luxuriously coiffed and curled automatically, much like Daryl Hannah's Madison in Spalsh! It must be the salt water that does this... Watch for the scene at the seal pond at the London Zoo. A classic.",1333238400,11,848,4.937062937062937
4510476,4,B004ZMBKOE,"This is not really a good movie. The story (a mermaid captures a married man on a fishing holliday and persuades him to take her with him on land) is being told in a much too simple way, it's almost boring. The reason I still give it 4 stars is because I really enjoyed the way miss Johns plays the mermaid. Then there is also a really funny, if short, appearence by Margaret Rutherford. In this case the sequel (""Mad About Men"") was better than the original.",1312070400,6,459,4.287356321839081
4510477,4,B004ZMBKOE,"VCI Entertainment and Gainsborough Pictures presents ""MIRANDA"" (1948) (80 min/B&W) -- Starring Glynis Johns, Googie Withers, Griffith Jones, John McCallum, Margaret Rutherford & David Tomlinson

Directed by Ted Kotcheff

Another great film from the British Invasion compliments of VCI.

Miranda is a nice little fantasy and Glynis Johns practically glows in the title role. Besides Griffith Jones and Googie Withers other performances of note are David Tomlinson as their butler with big ears who Miranda seems particularly taken with.

Margaret Rutherford as the practical nurse who always believed in mermaids.

Googie Withers is excellent as Jones ultimately understanding wife. Despite the improbable premise, one can't help but be drawn into this very funny film.

Don't leave the theater before the very end, final scene which leaves more questions unanswered as the censors weren't paying attention.

8450258,4,B004ZMBKOE,"Peter Blackmore's witty and sophisticated mermaid play became the liveliest--and most naughtily suggestive--of all filmed fish-out-of-water comedies thanks to this uniformly sparkling Gainsborough cast under Ken Annakin's direction. The deadpan title credits include ""Tail by Dunlop"" (and the final title card reads, simply, ""Fin""), and I found myself laughing out loud even before the nonstop one-liners and double entendres, all in good Anglo taste, even began.

Miranda, temporarily transplanted from Cornwall to London, is an outrageous coquette, bewitching in rapid succession a married doctor, his chauffeur and a portrait painter. She sings her siren song entirely nonplussed by her rubberized appendage (which she boasts gives her serial seductions an ""element of surprise"") and, fed rather well on oysters, salmon and cockles, yearns to pop in--twice--at the Covent Garden Opera. Her timing is perfect--although this supposedly is (dirty postwar) London in August--as RHEINGOLD is on the boards, followed by TRAVIATA and a madcap Miranda solo in an impromptu encore of the Brindisi.

Glynis Johns--a good Welsh singer for whom Sondheim composed ""Send in the clowns""--is dubbed singing at this early point in her career, but her perfected comedic timing and breathless sex appeal are matched by no other movie mermaid. She is consistently half a beat ahead of her audience and fellow actors, she manages the Lorelei's blonde wig and the Dunlop appendage smartly, and her delightful co-conspirators include Googie Withers and David Tomlinson, both particularly tuned in to the Miranda/Johns wavelength and every bit as eccentric as Nurse Margaret Rutherford. Both Tomlinson, with his spaniel eyes, and Withers, with her Gainsborough worldliness, manage to steal scenes away from Johns and Rutherford, no easy task but possible in this freewheeling, and very tolerantly suggestive, script.

Filmed stage plays rarely stand up to repeat viewings and quickly go stale, but the theatrical gimmickry here is perfectly realized through the underemphasized Dunlop tail (which everyone is thinking about but nobody dares talk directly about) and the cast's nonchalant avoidance of that awkward and embarrassing topic. Miranda's done Covent Garden and has effortlessly conquered three impressionable men, and she swims off down the Thames in the finale for a May confinement at home in Cornish waters. As she seduced Londoners, so the audience will want to relive the fantastic story over again, suspending disbelief and pondering Miranda's cunning ""element of surprise"" and mermaid motherhood. The mermaid's tale (and tail by Dunlop) continue in the 1954 color sequel MAD ABOUT MEN, regrettably without Annakin, Tomlinson or Withers but giving the delicious Glynis Johns an extension on this signature-role franchise.
