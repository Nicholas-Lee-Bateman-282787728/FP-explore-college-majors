However, it contains segments of full male and female nudity, lesbianism, cross-dressing, etc.  How one can feel that combining scripture with such anti-christian/Judaeo themes has left me floored.  I am truly disappointed that a Roman Catholic Franciscan Priest would be a part of such trash.  While what he says in the movie has merit and while there is some truth in the film , the overall impression left after watching a psychedelic piece of drama  with such nudity and foul language has left a very sour taste in my mouth.",1451260800,,635,4.7272727272727275
8419404,5,B0049U4QQQ,"At only $1.99 this is far cheaper than a hit of good lsd and several times as effective if you want a truly mind and soul-expanding experience.  No, it's not for the faint of heart, nor is it for those whose religion is rigid, narrow minded, fearful and intolerant. If you are followers of the ""Gospel of No"" this film is not for you--though of course it is in part about you.  But if your tastes tend towards the aesthetically ""outside the box"" you NEED to see this film.  If your religion is strong and deep, if you believe in a fair and loving God you NEED to see this film.  It may be one of the most holy experiences you will ever have.",1297555200,,641,4.145161290322581
8419405,5,B0049U4QQQ,"A brilliant, visionary film. A must see, like no other film you've ever seen. A celluloid triumph, that will go down in film history. It's not for everybody, you must have a working brain! What would happen if God sent his daughter this time, would she find a better reception than her brother did? Pink and Blue films first feature length film from the people who brought you ""W the Movie!"" A new religious experience!",1297555200,4,419,4.6
8419406,1,B0049U4QQQ,The only thing I have to say from just looking at the preview is: BLASPHEMY! BLASPHEMY! BLASPHEMY! And you will be judged harshly by God for using and misleading the children with this ABOMINATION of a project! REPENT NOW! Pastor Roberts in DC! I also put 1 star because the review page gives no option for no stars which it really rates...,1297468800,,340,4.5
