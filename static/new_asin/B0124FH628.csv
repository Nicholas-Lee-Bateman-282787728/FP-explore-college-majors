8725266,4,B0124FH628,"What can be said about Jeff Hardy that pretty much hasn't been said...he's one of the most charismatic superstars of this generation, a true to life enigma, daredevil in life and one of the most popular wrestlers in history to the point where TNA has released another DVD set (only one to get this many sets from TNA) decided to him here in ""Humanomoly.""  It should be noted that despite TNA advertising this as a ""Volume 3"", this more of an essential greatest matches set that used matches from his previous sets along with new material as well.

TNA Debut vs. x Division Champion A.J. Styles - This was at the second anniversary show & suppose to be Kid Kash's title shot against A.J. but due to Kash being injured, Styles had to face a mystery man which turned out to be the TNA debut of Jeff Hardy making this an X division dream match. Both men challenged each other to take their best shot against each other with Styles chopping Hardy so hard that he knocked off his neck collar. Both men were able to match each other move for move throughout the match until it was ruined by Kid Kash & Dallas but it was Hardy & Styles who were left standing in the end.

Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Abyss - Both men started brawling in the ring before taking the fight to the outside & backstage area within minutes with both men taking advantage of the environment before they came back to the ring using weapons such as a chair & ladder in different ways to punch their opponents even at the expense of themselves from unprotected chairshots to a powerbomb through a table in what was a physical contest with one man getting the final word in after the match.

Steel Cage/Tables Match vs. Raven - Tables were already setup in the cage only for Hardy to bring chairs inside as well as both men used the cage to their advantage sending each other into it head first & grinding it against the steel until they were bleeding as each man attempted on high impact offense that ultimately sent themselves through a table instead of their opponent while also using the broken pieces of the table & chairs as a weapon as well in match that was physical with quite a visual for how the match ended.

Monster's Ball Match vs. Sabu vs. Abyss vs. Rhino - The ""gimmick"" for this match was that all four men were locked away in a dark room for hours with no food or water right before they came into the match competed under hardcore rules with started out right away in a four way brawl in & outside of the ring that went through the crowd with multiple men bleeding in the opening moments with various weapons coming into play from kendo sticks shots to chokeslams on chairs to bodies flying through tables including Jeff Hardy's swanton that you had to see to believe in what was definitely an extreme war to say the least.

vs. A.J. Styles w/Abyss as the special enforcer - Talk about deja vu as Hardy's first match in TNA was against the same man here in his return to TNA with the difference being that this happened during the period where A.J. was the TNA Champion but also aligned with Ric Flair leading to Hulk Hogan making Abyss (Styles opponent at the upcoming PPV) the special enforcer to ensure Flair doesn't get involved. Both men traded off chops in the corner before Styles focused on Hardy's leg & worked over it using the tactics done by Flair himself in the past. Hardy did his usual unique offense during the match which A.J. was able to adapt to over time like his counter to the Twist Of Fate with the pele kick. Nice match between the two.
""Impact"" Mar. '10
[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2]

TNA Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle vs. Mr. Anderson - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with each men having their moments to look strong with such moments like both Angle & Hardy going after Anderson early, Kurt Angle german suplexing both men at the same time while later applying an single anklelock to both men, Angle injuring his ribs via a samoan roll from Anderson off the top rope followed by a Hardy swanton bomb on both men, and Angle delivering a top rope Angle Slam. The big story here was the appearance of Eric Bischoff with a chair looking to hit someone with it before Hulk Hogan made his first appearance in weeks coming down the ramp & getting in the ring on crutches looking ready to fight Bischoff who took one of the crutches before Hardy intervened & took the crutch from Hogan...to nail Kurt Angle with it & hit Anderson with the other one causing Hardy to pin Anderson. From there, Jeff Jarrett & Abyss came down to the ring to celebrate with Hogan & Bischoff & Hardy when RVD made his way down only for Hardy to nail him with the championship. Abyss' words rang true as ""THEY"" arrived on 10-10-10.

[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2; Immortal Forever]

Ladder Match vs. TNA Champion Mr. Anderson - Despite various ladders setup around ringside, Hardy came out with his own custom painted ladder before the match. As expected in a ladder match involving Jeff Hardy, there were various bumps & spots involved here such as Hardy's flip powerbomb off the ladder, Anderson back dropped on the ladder while later hurting his wrist on the steel steps, Hardy doing a springboard legdrop off the steps on the outside, and Anderson delivering his rolling samoan drop on the ladder before hitting his own swanton bomb with his head hitting the ladder. The only thing I can really say bad here was that they had an ending planned that would have looked great if they pulled it off but because of an issue with the belt, both guys landed very hard & they had to just do an audible with the finish. For Anderson not having much experience in ladder matches, he looked strong here & held his own while we know Hardy is ""at home"" in these type of matches so while he wasn't a ""car crash spotfest"" ladder match, this was really good.
Against All Odds '11
[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2]

vs. Jeff Jarrett - All I can say for the first moment of the match is ""Don't Blink"" as Hardy pulled a fast one on Jarrett which he couldn't handle & had the match restarted. Jarrett got in control & tried to keep Hardy down limiting his daredevil offense throughout the match but he was able to catch Jarrett again in the blink of an eye which drove Jarrett crazy causing him to use a chair & force the referee back in the ring to restart the match again only for Hardy to once again catch Jarrett for the third time in a row. This entire scenario was pretty entertaining & did it's job in putting Hardy over big time in his first major comeback match.
Turning Point '11

Steel Cage Match vs. Jeff Jarrett - This match had various stipulations attached to it such as Karen Jarrett would be handcuffed to Sting at ringside while Hardy would be fired if he lost but would get a World Title match if he won along with one of the Jarrett's being fired as well. Both men attempted to climb out the cage various times early on in the match with Jarrett countering one attempt by shoving Hardy down on his head while Hardy used his unique daredevil offense here such as a body splash & attempted Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage. At one point both men were fighting for the door to be opened with Sting getting the effects of it resulting in Karen also attempting to help Jeff with a weapon we haven't seen in a very long time. This isn't a classic cage match but was entertaining.
Final Resolution '11

Steel Cage Match vs. Kurt Angle - Angle came into this match with his knee heavily taped but dominated right from the start & resorted to dirty tactics the minute Hardy started to mount some momentum but Hardy still brought the fight only for it to keep backfiring like his springboard kick in the corner had him hurt himself by landing on his own head & later his own momentum being used by Kurt to launch himself into the cage as Kurt continued to bring the pain as Hardy head was busted open from it being grinded into the cage & throwing it into the cage over & over again. Hardy finally got some offense in including a Twist Of Fate/Stunner combination before Angle bounced back catching Hardy on the top rope for an Angle Slam as they really picked up the pace & hit move after move from Hardy countering Kurt's anklelock into one of his own followed by two Swanton Bombs that had Hardy's entire weight crash on top of Kurt's chest before Hardy counter the Angle Slam with one of his own followed by his own Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage. This match told the story well of Hardy trying to beat Angle at his own game & definitely was the match of the night.
Lockdown '12

vs. TNA Champion Austin Aries - Hardy (complete with a new entrance theme) & Aries tried to show up each other early on with shoves & slaps before Aries was able to take control & really throw it in Hardy's face causing Jeff to lose his cool & make Aries pay for it before giving a ""receipt"" for the showing off. They took the match to the outside where Hardy used to guardrail & turning Aries upside down into the steps before returning to the ring where Aries was able to take advantage of a mistiming by Hardy working over the back with various holds like an under grip backbreaker, grounded abdominal stretch, and top rope dropkick o the back. The action continued to pick up with Hardy countering Aries brainbuster & Aries delivering two back to back suicide dives squishing Hardy on the outside between himself & the guardrail with such impact that Aries cut himself above the eye before the match got taken to the ramp with Hardy's head taking a nasty bump. This was a really good main event here as they told a good story with the crowd also being split adding to the match.
Bound For Glory '12

TNA Championship/Ladder Match vs. Austin Aries - This started off normal between both men but didn't stay that way for long as the ladder came into play very quick starting with a tug of war on the outside followed by various high impact moves like a russian leg sweep off the ladder, a dive into an upside down open ladder followed by a roll on the ladder with the other sandwiched inside, and trapped on the outside with the steps on top of the ladder. The ladder continued to be used as a weapon such as when it was shoved from underneath causing a crash & burn onto the mat, one man the ladder being rode down onto the other, Aries doing a missile dropkick knocking one off the ladder, both men falling off one ladder landing on another, and more than one Twist Of Fate using the ladder. This was a very good ladder match that saw not only some impactful spots but also told the good story of Aries constantly trying to out think Hardy.
Turning Point '12

TNA Championship/Elimination Match vs. Austin Aries vs. Bobby Roode - Jeff Hardy came into this match as the odd man out as Aries & Roode already revealed that they made a deal to work together as a team to take out Hardy which was showcased throughout the match with both men working him over together & take away his daredevil offense by keeping him grounded causing Hardy to use different strategies such as hit & run on both men or single out one man at a time which was able to keep Hardy one step ahead of both men at times including using one to execute offense on the other while capitalizing on moments of miscommunication between Roode & Aries as well.  This was a very good main event with the story of the match playing out perfectly.
Genesis '13

Tables Match: The Hardys vs. TNA Tag Team Champions The Wolves vs. Team 3D - This was the second match in their series for the TNA Tag Team Titles as this started out as a six way brawl with tables being used in unique ways as weapons such as to counter & execute offense with more effect along with different areas of the table not normally used against their opponents & different types of strategies used use as using a teams own momentum against them to break tables or moving it out the way so another team wouldn't win the match in a good encounter that had quite the visual for the win.
""Impact"" Sept. '14

The Hardys vs. The Wolves - This was a #1 contenders match with The Revolution watching from the balcony. Both teams were evenly matched trading momentum using double team offense with the Wolves using fast tags & a physical style singling out one opponent while the Hardys worked over both Wolves individually using some of their aerial daredevil offense in & outside of the ring executing one signature impactful move after another in a competitive match.
""Impact"" Jan. '15

Lethal Lockdown Match vs. James Storm - This was subtitled ""Hardy's Revenge"" due to Jeff looking to get his hands on Storm after injuring him weeks earlier as both men used the weapons such as a trash can & chair against each other along with the cage structure itself in unique ways along with Hardy looking for receipts for what he did earlier in what was this match designed to be, a hardcore brawl.
""Impact"" Mar. '15

TNA Tag Team Championship/Ultimate X Match: The Hardys vs. Austin Aries & Bobby Roode vs. Kenny King & Low-Ki vs. Ethan Carter III & Bram - This was the finals of the tournament for the vacant Tag Team Championships that featured such highlights as a one man being thrown so hard that he took out the camera man, a third party getting involved in the action including being so strong that he shook the structure knocking everyone off, another object coming into play, and unique ways of assisting their partners in climbing the ropes in what was a fun match.
""Impact"" Apr. '15

Other matches include tag matches with Matt Hardy from Impact against The BroMans (Oct. '14), Ethan Carter III & Tyrus (Oct. '14), Samoa Joe & Low-Ki (Nov. '14), and James Storm & Khoya (Apr. '15) along with his 2010 TNA return.  Bonus material include an interview with Jeff, a music video, acoustic performances & a tour of his art collection.

The only real negatives I have is that some of the matches on here could have been replaced with better quality encounters as such the recent cage match against The Revolution or the entire series between Team 3D & The Wolves or their first singles encounter against Team 3D or his 2009 classics against Kurt Angle.  You can't win them all but this is definitely a collection that would satisfy any Hardy fan so it's something I would recommend.",1438992000,,14656,4.436106983655275
