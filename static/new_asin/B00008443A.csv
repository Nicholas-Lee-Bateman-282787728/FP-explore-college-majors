8220409,5,B00008443A,"Right, this is the original issue format in Japan of episodes 5,6,7 of Haibane Renmei. Original early pressings of this (and I think up to 2013 or so) had a highly desirable soundtrack CD, Puchi NoNe (out of tracks) as an extra. I hoped to get this, and failed. Current pressings don't have it. I still want it.
NEVER MIND you still get one of the best anime ever made, sound and picture excellent if only in Japanese.
The plot so far: new Haibane Rakka, having found her place in Old Home and why she smells of cake (see ep3 on COG.2 for that; oh, Hikari, how COULD you?) discovers more about her new world and how Haibane take their leave of it; which discovery causes much pain and makes the story take a decided turn for the darker.
Get all 5 COGs for the whole story. If you need English, there is a R1 currently from Funimation on 2 DVDs, a R2 in English is not current but can be got on EBay....this is R2 but NTSC and exclusively in Japanese.
The extras make it worth while.",1456617600,,982,4.2287234042553195
