5400525,4,B00A8PPBM4,"A convict is caught between two not so great alternatives -  living with savages who were very good to him and returning to English prison. Don't want to say more and spoil it for viewers. Acting is so-so, but the beauty of Australia, views of aboriginal culture, and the story of survival made it a good watch.",1434412800,10,311,4.456140350877193

5400546,5,B00A8PPBM4,Wonderful documentary on the life of William Buckley and how he was sent from England to Australia to the penal colony or basically dumped on a continent for apparently stealing some cloth he was holding in England? The documentary quickly goes through his life of 25 years of how he lived with the Aborigines is extraordinary.  Also life circumstances gave him no other choice but to live and be taught by aborigines who took him in as a spirit. Humanity chose him and he also chose humanity and love.  Because the aborigines believed he was a spirit he was not allowed to fight in any tribal wars and was very respected through the  many years.  I especially liked the part where he says that the girls and the woman were almost all the cause of all the problems!,1484870400,,765,4.521739130434782

5400550,4,B00A8PPBM4,"This is a story of a Man running for years in the Outback from English servitude and wilding into Aboriginal life. He is awash in fear as The Tribe accepts him and teaches Aboriginal beliefs and practices. 42 years later he must again choose between English and Aboriginal forces. Narrated but the narrator envelops well into the film seeming more like a character. I enjoyed the settings and filming, the acting was good, and the storyline stayed the test between action and dialouge!

5400582,3,B00A8PPBM4,"Would have rated it four stars, but I feel that the English documentary style (modern day interpreter stopping the film cold by giving details) may have been intrusive in the flow of the film style and story line. I think the audience would have gotten it without those breaks. The aboriginal modern day interpreter was not intrusive. Don't know why that is. Perhaps the aborigine still had a connection with the past, but the modern intellectual Englishman appeared cut off from the psyche of this history of William Buckley. Remake the film and make it flow better. Main actor is great. A good story. Felt so sorry for Wm. Buckley, but the story is a contribution to us.",1476144000,,672,4.703389830508475

I can't really say it was a family movie, and many of the themes are quite dark (cannibalism, tribe fighting, abuse of native populations) but hey, it's history, and history can be dark. If you are a survival buff, or if you like history films, this may be for you, but I would not suggest it for a date night or a movie to bring home to your wife for the evening. I guess it verifies the one inescapable truth of history: man's abuse against fellow man. I feel sorry for the people depicted in this film. I hope that future generations will find a way to be kinder and more respectful of each other, until then, films like this can at least document what happened in the past.",1455580800,,760,4.212328767123288

They call in experts to interpret a lengthy nineteenth century interview that survives of his account. The beliefs and practices of the Aborigines before extended contact with Europeans was actually more interesting than Buckley's story to me.
They pushed the ""Robinson Crusoe"" analogy a bit hard, so it just missed the 4th star to me. It times in as an interesting hour of viewing if you are interested in this sort of thing.

5400920,5,B00A8PPBM4,"As an Aussie now in exile myself, it was incredibly nostalgic and true to life. This is the THE STORY we learned in childhood history. Buckley lived almost 32 years in the Australian wilderness with aborigines before turning up again in 1835.  It just amazes me that he lasted that long given the long periods of solitude in a harsh environment.  Even today, it would be hard to survive in the more remote parts of Australia without help.  His story gave rise to the Australian saying, ""you've got Buckley's chance.."" for something that seems impossible.  It's also a story that gives incredible insight into the first inhabitants of Australia whose lives were to tragically change for the worse soon after settlement of Port Phillip Bay. I am fortunate enough to have a copy of both the short three page manuscript that Buckley wrote soon after his arrival in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) in 1837 and also the one that was coaxed out of him by John Morgan, in 1852, who is the interviewer in the movie.  This drama has elements of both stories and is, I think, pretty accurate. I recommend this movie for the scenery and the insights it gives to aboriginal life.",1451779200,22,1163,4.681372549019608

The man himself, William Buckley, was a resourceful and intelligent man, a survivor first and foremost.  The angst he felt as the inevitable collision of two world views unfolded before him was real, and his story is a sad one.  This is a balanced and fair treatment of both points of view, and well worth the viewing.  I appreciate that it glorifies neither side, but seeks to document what happened without judgment, but rather as a factual presentation.",1446768000,,604,5.01
