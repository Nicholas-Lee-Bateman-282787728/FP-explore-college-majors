8088831,5,B000BMASDQ,"Dis show was so much in a class by itself,dat some of us went into mourning after it was taken off the air after only two seasons. I'm reminded of how great it was after occasionally catching Dennis Farina in his new cop series(which is nuthin').Farina was in a class by himself as Detective Mike Torello in this series;Farina had been a real life Chicago cop-and one of the bad guys,Paulie Taglia-played by John Santucci-had been a real-life Chicago thief. Other greats-and not including everybody were the great Joseph Wiseman as (Meyer Lanskyesque bad guy)Manny Weisbord,Ted Levine as crazy bad guy Frank Holman,David Lang as ""Jewish"" lawyer David Abrams,the great Andrew Dice Clay as Manny Weisbord protege Max Goldman and Anthony John Denison as Farina/Mike Torello nemisis Ray Luca.

After two years,the series ended with Luca(Denison) and Farina(Torello)fighting on a plane that crashed into the water. Hopefully,Farina's new cop show gets cancelled-and we can somehow move into the third season of 'Crime Story'.Until then,the theme 'Runaway' by Del Shannon should never be played,in protest.",1158019200,,1100,5.32183908045977
