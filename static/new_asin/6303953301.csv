7857374,3,6303953301,"This feature length movie was a made for cable release that originally aired on TNT in 1995. It is not to be confused with the original Jonny Quest series. The plot involves an attack on a space shuttle by a craft that is filled with giant insects that have been genetically modified. The Quest team gets involved in the fight, along with their new cyborg robot.

Let me in it's say that the movie is very fun to watch, once you get over the shock of ""everything is changed"" if you are a fan of the old series. But think of the Quest characters in an alternate dimension since it is a different show with some of the basic ideas intact, but different just the same. The bad guys were now over the top and melodramatic.  Everybody is more... well, cartoony and closer to a typical action cartoon than the old show. But what can you expect with different creators.

40 years ago Hanna Barbara created what had been one of the most popular cartoons ever, Jonny Quest. That 1964-65 animated series ran in prime time on ABC, back when we had 4 channels to choose from.  It had a special magic that made kids (and adults) mouths drop open from the opening credits into the end. The characters in the original series were very realistic, and they traveled to exotic places that were made real in the architecture sounds and cultures described there (for their time, not all of it is PC now). The old soundtrack music featured a cool spy era jazz that really brought all the elements together. The new soundtrack is typical cartoon stuff.

My advice is to get it for the fun of seeing the team in a different light.  If you are really attached to the old series, you may not be able to appreciate it for what it is.",1113436800,8,1707,4.386075949367089

It is a very well done cartoon, and plenty of action and the insect a ma bobbers are kool ... i enjoy watching it still ...me having to much money at the moment need to buy this, send some donations towards a chihuahua fund, then get stoned and watch this.  I still just dig the movie, love it.  Good movie ... Jonny is kool, and the bug a ma toids of whatever are clever...as an anime/sci fi/fantasy guy ( i dig X, Vampire hUnter D, and Dragon Ball, among works of Tim Burton and Adam JOnes the guitarist in Tool) i still find time in my head for this movie.  I just like it, and i hope other old/new cartoon buffs will dig this too.  Be Yourself Man.",1108598400,,770,4.0130718954248366
