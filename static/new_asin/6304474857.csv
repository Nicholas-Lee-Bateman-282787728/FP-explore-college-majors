7872157,3,6304474857,This video is not up to standards as you would expect for a documentary on the animal that is suppose to be about . There is too much on the people and places instead of showing and narrating the bear . This video is not like the other documentaries on other animals and other bear videos that I have viewed .,1466121600,,309,4.081967213114754

7872160,4,6304474857,"The primary focus of this video is, of course, the giant Kodiak grizzly bear, the largest subspecies of the brown bear alive today (the plains grizzly was larger, but hunted entirely to extinction;) however, the film also spends a good deal of time discussing and portraying the Alutiiq people of Kodiak Island, who have lived together with the bear for thousands of years.
We watch intimate footage of the bears as they fish, play, fight, mate, den, forage and feed - these are remarkable animals of immense strength and power. It is easy to understand why the native people of the North American continent came to revere the bear. The scenery is striking, with huge, jutting mountains, lush, fertile meadows, and beautiful, clear streams overflowing with salmon. The video speaks of how humans and bears can tolerate each other, but also shows the darker side of human ""relations"" with the huge grizzly - historic footage, as well as bear carcasses found during the filmmaking are shown unflinchingly, reminding us of the despicable actions of which we are capable.
The viewer learns about the history of the bear and the people, how they have co-existed, and how developments in the last century have put them both in danger of losing their ways of life as ""modern civilization"" threatens to take over the island for tourism. The Alutiiqs struggled to sustain themselves trying to cover the high cost of importing even common items (when the film was made, a pound of butter cost $4.00, for example,) without resorting to catering to tourists to the detriment of the bears and the island's habitat as a whole.
But, when faced with starving or selling out, the two tribes began to build certain tourist attractions which they could then profit from. Huge corporations were offering to buy their land and give them jobs, but the natives of the island were trying to hold out from taking this last step, which would have virtually guaranteed the destruction of much of the island's natural habitat. Fortunately, there is a happy ending that had not yet happened when NGS produced the video; the US government purchased the bulk of Kodiak Island with the damage funds from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, and the island is now mostly a wildlife refuge, thankfully.
Overall, this is a very good video for bear lovers, or for people who wish to learn more about this amazing animal.",1035763200,5,2375,4.881188118811881
7872161,5,6304474857,"What can one say about the largest bears south of the Arctic Circle? This National Geographic film says a lot, and it is all well worth the time to view. Many who still think bears are carnivores will be surprised at the  variety of foods bears eat. We also learn much about bear/human relations  some of which may be disturbing for younger viewers. All in all this piece  portrays the bears well. Showing both sides of bear personalities to  perfection. As with most Geographic pieces this one will be watched many  times.",949449600,,523,4.641304347826087
