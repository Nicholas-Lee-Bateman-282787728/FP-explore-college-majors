8752633,5,B01CD7VFB0,"This is the best, most complete documentary of the history of cowboys, how cattle came to Hawaii, especially the Big Island of Hawaii, I have ever seen.  I lived on this island for 30 years, was honored to be invited to the initial Premier of this movie before it came out on video.  I was so happy when I found a DVD on Amazon to replace my old video! It even has the same ""cover"" as the video!  The photography of the island is fantastic, as is the way it was all so professionally done. It's a movie everyone will enjoy while being educated at the same time!",1499040000,,561,4.175925925925926
