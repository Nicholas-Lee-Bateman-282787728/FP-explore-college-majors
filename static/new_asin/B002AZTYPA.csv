3892752,4,B002AZTYPA,"I loved the first Lawnmower Man movie . . . the sequil to it, Job's War, not so much.  I love the characters and story plot.  I wish the potty mouth language wasn't in it, but overall it was a good movie.",1359158400,2,204,3.8333333333333335
3892753,1,B002AZTYPA,This movie was in Standard Screen 4:3 format not Letterbox format as stated on box. To much trouble to get this fixed.,1313366400,6,118,4.409090909090909
3892754,1,B002AZTYPA,I have to agree with the reviwer above. It's a ripoff. They claim that it's in widescreeen but it's not.,1269734400,26,104,4.25
3892755,1,B002AZTYPA,"Despite the specs on the back of the package stating both films are in 16x9 widescreen, they ARE NOT.  This is a repackage of the 2006 double feature DVD.  It is the EXACT SAME DVD with fullscreen transfers only.  This makes New Line's DVD art department scumbag liars... or just incompetent.  Right?",1254528000,34,300,4.711538461538462
3892756,1,B002AZTYPA,"When I first saw the Lawnmower man, it was pretty lengthy and quite epic - clocked in at well over 2 hours (I think it was more like 2.5 hours).  Job's transformation was more gradual, whereas this version is a cut of the original.  Why do they destroy decent movies like this?  Trash.
I have no comment on LM2 - I saw it once when it came out on VHS and never really liked it, so I haven't watched the version on this disc to know if it's as badly shredded as the first movie.",1477180800,2,477,4.0

3892759,5,B002AZTYPA,"Lawnmower Man (original) is a classic; so I gave this a 5 star.  With that said, Lawnmower Man II is just ""so-so""... In fact, I can't even remember the details to the movie.  BUT... because it's a sequel, as a collector, you just have to have both!  And since this makes that easy, why not? (rhetorical, don't answer!)",1461369600,,318,4.448275862068965

3892762,5,B002AZTYPA,Lawnmower Man was as good as I remembered it. I don't know why they are bad mouthing Lawnmower Man 2. It is a good enough movie. It has some VR & plenty of action.,1449532800,,163,3.823529411764706
3892763,1,B002AZTYPA,"I wish I had read the product reviews before I bought this item. It's a movie I've seen, read the specs and thought that's all I needed to know. I was SO wrong! I feel bad because I blamed the seller when I got this DVD, at first. A case for the Lawnmower Man Collection and a disk for the Double Feature, but APPARENTLY this isn't because the seller was being deceitful, but the movie distributor. Really disappointing.",1441324800,3,420,4.397435897435898
3892764,4,B002AZTYPA,Company was GREAT to deal with but the manufacture that made it was misleading NO WAY TO GET LETTERBOX even though manufacture says you can Does NOT make any difference who you buy it from the disc will NOT give you letterbox even though the case says it is available,1416960000,4,267,4.36
3892765,4,B002AZTYPA,Lawnmower Man 1 a dim witted man is transformed into a God like creature by virtual reality and drugs !Lawnmower Man 2 is wack should have never been made !,1363737600,,156,4.233333333333333
8360586,5,B002AZTYPA,I always thought this film was ahead of its time. Now certain parts look like a cheap video game. Its ok because its worth seeing Jobes character develop throughout the film - amazing!  Very interesting flick indeed.,1526342400,,216,4.837837837837838

8360589,2,B002AZTYPA,"15 minute's in the beginning of the movie, The most important, and tear jerking moments of this movie were cut out of this film to make room on the DVD. I have this on VHS. That's how I know. Was dissapointed",1521417600,,208,4.097560975609756

8360592,5,B002AZTYPA,"The first Lawnmower Man movie is a true gem in sci-fi horror.  The old style CGI is a joy to watch in action.  It's a shame this movie hasn't been given a hi-def bluray release.

The second Lawnmower Man movie is sadly not as good.  They replaced the majority of the CGI with traditional filmed footage, the idea being that computer graphics had advanced so far that they are indigtinguishable from real life.  The problem here is it causes the movie to lose the charm that the CGI brought to the first.

Overall it's great to have the two movies together.  The first movie is well worth the price of the collection alone.  But if any DVD Bluray producers are reading, give Lawnmower Man the hi-def treatment, it deserves it!",1489795200,,725,4.523076923076923
8360593,1,B002AZTYPA,"The cover states that both movies are in both widescreen and full screen formats, but Lawnmower Man in only in Full Screen. This makes me angry, since I bought these for the Widescreen version.",1489449600,,193,4.705882352941177

8360595,1,B002AZTYPA,"The box clearly states that both movies are 16:9 but the movies on the disc are 4:3. In fact, the first movie rubs it in by displaying the text ""this movie has been formatted to fit your screen"" when it starts.",1478995200,,210,4.146341463414634
