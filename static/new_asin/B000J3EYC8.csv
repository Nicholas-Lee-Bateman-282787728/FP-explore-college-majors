I'll never get my time back but I'd like my money back. Nothing inspiring and nothing learned. Belongs on free YouTube not on paid Amazon. Very disappointing",1469923200,,193,4.705882352941177
8148847,1,B000J3EYC8,I was looking for real-life accounts from nurses regarding t heir careers and experiences. It was a good bit too general for me and I feel I wasted $10.,1389139200,,152,4.275862068965517
8148848,5,B000J3EYC8,Used this video for a course on community health.  Stimulated a great discussion on the evolving health care system and the divide between what we want and what we can afford.,1369785600,,175,4.645161290322581
