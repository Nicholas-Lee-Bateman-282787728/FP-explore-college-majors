4484446,5,B004VSLE7U,"This film SIZZLES with chromatic color! The Head Costumer & the Set Stylist really GOT IT when they chose the hue and chroma of their color pallets!  This is a nice story, well-acted, moves along with smiles, tears, and some laughs.  But, this films amazing tapestry of colors belong to a specific film-genre, the gorgeous likes of which have not been seen since.  Watch this film...and enjoy!",1345939200,4,393,4.835820895522388
4484447,4,B004VSLE7U,You can see the beautiful talented Cyd perform in the modern ballet mode.  The only fault is there should have beeen more of her.  But it is delightful to see her perform so beautifully.,1345334400,3,186,4.4411764705882355
4484448,5,B004VSLE7U,"Even if it had turned out very badly, ""The Unfinished Dance"" would have been an extraordinary film. Back in the late 1940's, making a large budget film was actually a more corporate decision than it is today. Which makes you wonder how something that is a weird mix of ""The Red Shoes"" and a pre-teen ""Crime & Punishment"" was ever approved for production.

Fortunately things turned out very well and for today's viewers the film's uniqueness is not the only reason to watch it. Most likely it was intended as a vehicle to showcase nine year old Margaret O'Brien's acting and dancing talents. O'Brien was an extremely hard working and motivated child actress, and ""The Unfinished Dance"" is the most accomplished of her many solid performances. She really gets to demonstrate her range, moving between her standard self-parodying cuteness and a convincing demonic side that should be quite a nice surprise to first-time viewers.

There are some extremely slick ballet scenes, with Cyd Charisse and Karin Booth (if it is not Booth's actual dancing they did a seamless job of matching close-ups and master shots). The Swan Lake scene is especially effective with the stage floor covered in mirrors to simulate the surface of the lake.

Little Meg Merlin (O'Brien) worships the featured dancer Ariane Bouchet (Charisse) at her ballet school. When guest dancer La Daria (Booth) displaces her for the season, Meg and her friend Josie (a very young Elinor Donahue) conspire to sabotage her performance by turning off the stage lights in mid-dance. Things go horribly wrong when Meg throws the wrong switch. La Daria suffers a career ending injury. Meg and Josie promise to keep Meg's involvement a secret.

This gives O'Brien the whole second half of the film to play the Raskolnikov role, as she is torn between satisfaction that her idol has reclaimed the top spot in the company and guilt because of the unintended consequences of her actions. The guilt becomes too much to bear when La Daria becomes her instructor and demonstrates far more interest in Meg's dancing than her idol Bouchet ever did.

""The Unfinished Dance"" has a more contemporary shot selection than the standard 1940's-50's film. The story benefits from many close-ups of O'Brien's face, with the use of reaction shots more frequently than I can recall in any other film from this time period. O'Brien's expressiveness is nicely showcased and she is certainly up to the challenge.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1320105600,14,2491,4.961630695443645
4484449,5,B004VSLE7U,"I never heard of this film until I just missed catching it on TCM. The plot intrigued me, and it was based on a French film titled ""Ballerina."" It is a wonderful film, filled with ballet sequences which is a delight to the balletomane or lovers of all things Dance, like myself. The plot is pure soap opera and not terribly realistic, but it does contain a valuable lesson: the ability to forgive. Meg is a young girl who worships her favorite ballet teacher & company dancer Ariane, played by a young Cyd Charisse. But then a well-known, star ballerina, Darina comes to town and to the school. Meg sees how this interloper as a threat to the career of her beloved teacher, because Darina will be dancing the lead role in the school's production of Swan Lake instead of Ariane. Meg figures out a way to sabotage Darina's performance. What started out as a harmless prank has tragic results.

Meg is wracked with guilt, and ends up being singled out by Darina as a talent deserving to be privately coached. Meg realizes the beautiful, giving spirit Darina possesses, as opposed to the shallowness of her formal idol Ariane, which makes her feel even worse. To add to her pain and guilt, another student, jealous of Meg's talent, attempts to blackmail her. What does Meg end up doing?
Colorful, vibrant, with some terrific ballet numbers that only MGM did with their musicals, you will enjoy watching this little known dance movie. The DVD is not cheap ($24.95), but for such a rare and wonderful film, it is worth every penny. To see Cyd Charisse at her start was also a treat, and little Margaret O'Brien never fails to delight and bring a smile to your face.",1311984000,26,1659,4.60472972972973

4484453,5,B004VSLE7U,"Margaret O'Brien terminally cute.  In a tutu.  Tearjerker movie for ballet lovers.  Darling Margaret, what else to say?  The Internet Meme Pedo Bear might be applied, but that was the era when little girls dominated Hollywood movies.  Think The Good Ship Lollypop, for example.  Margaret was an excellent actress, and this is a loveable example of her work.  Tragic story but sympathetic handling.  Okay for kids and adults.  Now young actresses can't wait to grow up and play shocking parts, dye their hair, get into big trouble, etc.  The Unfinished Dance, unfortunately, is now finished.  This movie is nostalgia.  Sorry.",1433808000,,624,5.13

4484462,5,B004VSLE7U,"This was one of the great movies I loved to watch in the 1947-1948 yrs. I never forgot Margaret Obrien's graceful dancing
I am enjoying having the movie now. She and I are about the same years old now. She was a very gifted child star
I saw her in the Perry Mason show tonight and thought back all those years ago, at how I would have liked to be a ballet dancer also.

4484463,5,B004VSLE7U,I loved this movie as a child.  Margaret O'Brien was such a delightful and talented child actress without the usual dramatics that so many went through.  Cyd Charisse's dancing is a delight to watch.  This was her first film.,1392681600,,225,4.717948717948718
4484464,5,B004VSLE7U,Love this story about ballet with Margaret O'Brien as the little ballerina and Danny Thomas as her guardian.  Every little (and) older ballerinas will love the story and very modern Hollywood style ballet!  Not the slow classical you would expect. If you don't mind that - you will love this movie on video.,1390176000,,307,4.773584905660377
4484465,5,B004VSLE7U,First this movie came out In the 50's when musicals were very popular. I saw this movie when I was a teenager and loved It. For a long time I was unable to get this dvd as It was not available. So glad that It Is now for others to get a chance to see a wonderful musical.. I love the story line that shows older fashion  loyalty and I loved the cast  and If you like ballet dancing this movie really gives you a treat and the color of costumes Is great.  Danny Thomas made his movie debut In this movie and you just really attach yourself to him. He was wonderful.,1379548800,,564,3.9734513274336285

4484468,5,B004VSLE7U,I loved this movie.  I didn't know of its existance until I read about it on a biography site for Margaret O'Brien.  I've loved her work since I was a child and was pleased to learn of the movie and be able to see it.  I hear of so many raves about today's child actresses and feel none can beat her!!!  She displayed the guilt of her deed-though it was an accident-in a powerful way through her actions and facial expression!!!  I would recommend it to all who have seen her work as well as to those who are NOT familiar with her work!!!,1363046400,7,538,4.134615384615385
4484469,5,B004VSLE7U,"I remember the first time i saw this movie i was in awe. So the fact that amazon had it, i just had to get it. Margaret O'brien plays Meg Marlin who loves her ballet school's prima ballerina Ariana Bouche (Sid Charise) and is upset when a new and more famous ballerina the beautiful La Darina comes and becomes the star of the school. Meg wants to embarrass La Darina on stage but the prank goes horibly wrong. Meg must live with her actions, that haunt her every day. This movie makes me cry everytime not because its an overly sad movie, but you can feel megs pain being as young as she is and trying to move on from what sheis done. You should definitely check it out",1361491200,5,670,4.2015503875969

8444022,5,B004VSLE7U,"I bought this dvd because I loved little Margaret O' Brien in Our Vines Have Tender Grapes and because I thought my daughter would like it being about dance. As a guy, I never expected to like it. Wow, was I wrong. It really is well done in beautiful color! The ballet scenes are stunning. This film gave me an appreciation for ballet that I never had before. It also happens to be a great story about sin, redemption and forgiveness. It shows how moral guilt over our sins can affect our lives, something that isn't often considered in the healing process today in our ""post-Christian"" world which tends to disregard any notion of sin or the soul. This film, along with Our Vines and Music for Millions makes up what I call the Margaret O' Brien Catholic Trilogy. Each one has Christian themes with Music for Millions being the most Catholic. In it, little Maggie adds to her prayer and ""offers up"" a sacrifice for her sister by going without an ice cream sundae. All three are great films for kids today to see. But I think my favorite is The Unfinished Dance for its sheer beauty. Any kid who is into dance will probably love it.",1513555200,,1132,4.447115384615385
