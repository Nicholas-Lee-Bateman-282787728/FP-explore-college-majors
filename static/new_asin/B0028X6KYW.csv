3874892,4,B0028X6KYW,"The documentary is awesome. The only issue that bothered me is that it features Bobby McFerrin on the cover, possibly misleading the costumer as regards the true content of this DVD, which includes some (mostly spoken) contributions of McFerrin, among many other scientists and musicians.",1250726400,6,288,5.4222222222222225
3874893,5,B0028X6KYW,I recently saw this on PBS and immediately started searching for the DVD.  Very convincing neurobiological argument for the significance of music as inherent to humanity.  The program demonstrates that in a real sense WE ARE MUSIC!  I just got DVD in mail today and can't wait to watch it again!  BUY IT!,1247529600,15,304,4.679245283018868
3874894,5,B0028X6KYW,"I recorded this recently from PBS on my DVR and was spellbound from beginning to end.  In summation, I wasn't too surprised at the science of the brain discovered in live MRI's of listening and performing music - because music is my air and I must have it in my life all the time.  This is a comprehensive look at how the brain reacts in performance, just listening, atonal music, the sensory reactions from person to person, instrument, voices to others - the mic and camera into the uterus of a pregnant woman showing the baby smiling and hearing the music - all subjects confirming what we music makers have always believed - we are hardwired to appreciate and perform music with the cortex of the brain showing white hot light in the MRI - the brain on music.  Very exciting program and all the more sad and depressing when it also shows the importance to our childrens' education in all subjects when they learn to play music before the age of 10 and we have cut music and art as non essential subjects.  This should be seen by all educators and send a copy to your representative and senator and demand music education be returned to our schools.  More important, if you have a young child, prekindergarten age - get them lessons to play an nstrument, sing and learn to read music.  It will give them discipline and a distinct edge in their learning - throughout their lives.  Music can heal and the images of the brain on music certainly shows its power.
This DVD belongs in any music lover's collection - it proves what we musicians have always known and wish others understood.  Great production!!!",1247270400,51,1607,4.574912891986063

3874896,1,B0028X6KYW,the movie was horrible the only reason I brought was for a project that I was doing in school for a research,1400630400,,108,3.9545454545454546
3874897,5,B0028X6KYW,This is the best (of what's out there on DVD) that I have seen about the field of neuroscience and music.  You can see a lot of excerpts from this DVD at pbs website if you search for the music instinct.  I love having the DVD because it is absolutely amazing to watch with my music colleagues and music students.,1395446400,,313,4.2
3874898,5,B0028X6KYW,"I borrowed this DVD from the library. I fell in love of it. Bobby Mc Ferrin brings us to the neuroscience behind music... A passionate journey to the most complex process on the brain. For all passionates of music, this video is a MUST",1390608000,,235,4.363636363636363
3874899,5,B0028X6KYW,The data now about music and the brain is so compelling that everybody should be aware of the concepts in this easy to watch video.  McFerrin's humility and genius make this gorgeous film a delight.,1379203200,,198,4.6571428571428575
3874900,5,B0028X6KYW,He is a young man with many interests; notably music and astronomy. He like this DVD  very much. He is learning there is music everywhere.,1377302400,,138,4.52
3874901,5,B0028X6KYW,I bought this item for my granddaughter's boy friend who is studying music at Texas Christian University. There is music all around us; we just have to stop and listen.,1373673600,,168,4.633333333333334
3874902,5,B0028X6KYW,"Really thorough and eye opening movie.  I will watch this several more times, as there is so much to learn.  Great exploration from a scientific perspective.  The musicians add to the conversation and ask great questions too.  Even covers music therapy in the treatment of neurological conditions.  Get this.  You will be very satisfied, especially if you value science and sociological research based films.",1365379200,,408,5.296875
3874903,5,B0028X6KYW,"I liked the combination of science, theory and pure musical enjoyment.  It was good to have participants who like (as do I) all sorts of music - and who truly understand the underpinnings of it. Since I also like science it was a pleasure to learn even more about the neuroscience aspect of music.",1364256000,,297,4.5
3874904,5,B0028X6KYW,"This is an amazing video that really focuses on music and the brain.  A must-see for anyone who figures there is a connection between music and brain health & development, but doesn't know much about it.",1358899200,,203,4.638888888888889
3874905,5,B0028X6KYW,"This documentary explores and explains how music is produced by the brain, both in humans and in animals, how it influences all creatures, and why it is not only important, but vital for fulfillment and happiness. All educators should be required to view this at least once, and every politician and lawmaker should be mandated to view it at least 10 times. The destruction of music programs in our school systems has depleted the quality of all education.
The people interviewed in this film were able to explain and demonstrate the explanations of the both the beauty and the science of music.
A must see.",1357948800,,607,4.79047619047619
3874906,5,B0028X6KYW,"Do you love music and science? If so, you'll be absolutely enthralled by The Music Instinct. There is a universality to music that appears to transcend cultural and national boundaries, and even crosses over to species other than humans, and out into the universe itself. When The Music Instinct plays an adapted-for-human-ears version of the sound of a black hole, resonating in a very low B flat, it's clear that in a world where everything is vibration, music appears to be one of the closest ways humans can feel attuned to all that is.

This documentary style film intersperses questions asked by an unseen female narrator with comments by neuroscientist Oliver Sacks, physicist Brian Greene, and musicians including Bobby McFerrin, Audra McDonald, Richard Hawley, Daniel Barenboim, Evelyn Glennie, and Yo-Yo Ma. Samples of music from around the world and a summary of some of the main points in music theory are included in a thoughtful exploration of why music affects us as it does.

I was thrilled to hear inside the womb what unborn babies can hear when someone sings nearby (the words are audible), and to see how musician's brains can easily be identified based on the way they grow. And who knew that our brains are so active when hearing music that there is no ""musical section"" of the brain, per se, but instead music appears on MRI scans to fire neurons all throughout the brain? Another absolutely astonishing section of this movie showed how villagers living in a remote section of Africa who'd never before heard western music, interpreted western songs exactly the same as westerners do for emotional meaning (happy, sad, scary). Music appears to have curative, healing effects on people as well, helping people sing who can't speak, and move who are otherwise frozen.

The special features included on this DVD add tremendously to its overall impact and value, as Bobby McFerrin, Oliver Sacks  and Yo-Yo Ma discuss the healing power of music, string theory, cultural aspects of music, the math of sound, and more.

Highly recommended!",1339372800,,2055,4.997076023391813
3874907,5,B0028X6KYW,"This was an amazing movie. Love, Love , Love this!!!!!
This was almost like the musical what the bleep do we know. Which put this movie right up my alley. It was amazing to see on a neurological scale how music effects and is imprinted whith in us.",1332720000,,248,4.1875
3874908,5,B0028X6KYW,"Very helpful and informative documentary. It got a little bogged and esoteric near the end as it discussed animal ""singing"" though. Not much scientific basis for the claims it makes at that point but the rest was well supported and presented.",1331942400,,242,4.926829268292683
3874909,5,B0028X6KYW,"This video is a must for anyone who loves music theory, or teaches music lessons of any sort. What a wonderful presentation of how music is perceived by our minds and effects our emotions. I have watched it three times, and bought copies for my friends.",1322265600,,253,4.521739130434782
3874910,5,B0028X6KYW,"As a music teacher and fan of Bobby McFerrin, I've been wanting to watch this for a long time.  The video was exactly what I expected.  It explores the connection between music and the brain.  There is a lot of science in this video, but explained in a way that most people would be able to understand it.  Bobby McFerrin is in the video a good bit, but this is no Bobby McFerrin concert.  He's in less than half of the video.  It was very interesting and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the connection between music, music education, and the brain.",1308787200,5,585,4.37037037037037
3874911,2,B0028X6KYW,"There's 2 hours of my life I will never get back.  This is a rambling series of interviews with musicians who know little about science and scientists who know little about music.  Nothing is covered in sufficient detail to be meaningful and no conclusions are ever drawn.  Whenever some cogent theory is developed, it is promptly dismissed with little explanation, such as the relation between the normal human voice and its musical intonations.  Ironically, this was dismissed with a very musically intoned voice.  The final straw was when they brought string theory from abstract physics into the mix.  I then concluded they were just dragging this out to get a full 120 minutes.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a weak background in both science and music.  Otherwise, you may find the lack of focus rather annoying.

It may be PBS but it is definitely not NOVA material.",1294790400,23,884,4.84
3874912,4,B0028X6KYW,I happened on this PBS show after it had started and was fascinated by the ideas and concepts.  Bought a copy that I am loaning out to friends who have music as part of their life and presume some of them will buy their own copy for reference.,1278633600,,243,4.0625
3874913,5,B0028X6KYW,"This is one meaty video!  It's thankfully free of the 2-second sound bites, and in its 2 hrs (!) deals extensively with the science of music and the brain (lots of MRI images), and how music affects us.  This DVD probably will be best used by the rarified group of musicians/listeners who think about music instead of just using it as aural wallpaper.  One thing I particularly appreciated about it is that all of the excerpts of pieces that were featured in the main narrative were included in full in the special features section.  This DVD functions well as a companion to Levitin's ""The World in Six Songs"", which is also highly recommended.  I thought the lighting used for some of the music scientists' group discussions was a little over-dramatic, but who knows--maybe this subject is more important and deserving of dramatization than anybody knows!",1276128000,14,857,4.882758620689655
3874914,5,B0028X6KYW,"Terrific documentary validating what many of us believed, and now scientifically know about the power of music and the brain.",1255392000,6,125,5.3
3874915,5,B0028X6KYW,"The Music Instinct was a delight. I caught the last five minutes last July on a PBS public television broadcast and was simultaneously frustrated and intrigued at the eventual prospect of viewing it in its entirety once it got its proper release as a DVD. So just a few weeks ago I had the chance to see it. I watched it with a friend. She was blown away, as I was. Truly a ground-breaking program. Highly recommended.
I teach at a LA public high school and the fact that music programs are being cut is heartbreaking in the light of the insights provided by this program.",1254787200,3,572,4.40566037735849
8357086,5,B0028X6KYW,"This is an exhilarating and meaningful DVD for those interested in music from a scientific and emotional perspective. Neuroscience research through the use of brain scans shows the physical changes in the brain when listening to or performing music. It is brilliantly done. I have bought three copies to share with students, family and friends.",1493942400,,344,5.2727272727272725
