8214492,5,B000UR9TD2,"In this DVD things seem to get more real for Ed and Al. Ed finally becomes a State Alchemist, but once again he faces a huge tragic.

Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the most heartbreaking anime's you'll ever watch. I cry every time I watch this DVD.

I really recommend you get this, it is very good and one of the best anime's you'll probably ever watch.
