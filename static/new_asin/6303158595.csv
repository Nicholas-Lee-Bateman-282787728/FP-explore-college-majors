For me, though, the problem with this film is that, unlike most low-budget cinema of the '80s (it was apparently filmed in 1989, in Syracuse, NY, under the original - and truly terrible - title ""Constant Reminders""), this is not a genre piece - it's not horror, it's not sci-fi, it's not even nudie-comedy. Nope, it's a painfully earnest and almost totally unfunny (it does try, but fails) drama about two best buddies broken up by the wiles of a conniving, jealous (of their friendship) girlfriend.

Don't be fooled by the cover art, which seems to be trying to make this out to be some kind of twisted rom-com/buddy picture in the vein of ""This Means War"" (I know, I know - made two decades later, but you get the point). The film has a flashback-heavy structure that's very stilted and largely contrived, adding little in anything to the overall dramatic weight that the film is clearly aiming for. And then, to top it off, the film just sort of peters out, with no real resolution.

This seems like it must have been a passion project for writer-director-star Garrett Abdo (that's him, on the left, on the cover, sporting a less-mullet-y hairstyle than he has in the actual film), and while I want to respect that (and I do - anyone who could make a shot-on-film feature for a quarter of a million in 1989 and get it widely distributed deserves at least some measure), the end results are so underwhelming, it's hard to even enjoy this on a hate-watching basis.

I'm sure that RaeDon Home Video, who handled the original (and, to this date, only) distribution for this film probably looked at what they'd bought and asked themselves, ""How're we supposed to pitch this to the mom-&-pop stores? Jeez...wait - I know! Get the leads to pose for a totally misrepresentative publicity still, with the two guys holding guns and the female lead in a short dress, showing some leg, and then throw up some flames in the background - brilliant!"" And voila, it looks like any number of those cheapjack erotic 'thrillers' that were clogging up video store shelves in the late '80s and early '90s. (I know: I was there, working in one at the time.)",1447632000,,2205,4.603053435114504
