6658160,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"It was hilarious!  The comic timing was sometimes dry, but always quick.  I loved the plot pacing and was pleasantly surprised at each turn.  Tonight, I'm going to show it to my teenagers.",1412985600,,188,4.636363636363637
6658161,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"This movie pokes a lot of fun at reality TV. There's a lot of homage paid to comic book heroes. If any of that appeals to you, I think you'll really enjoy this movie. It's really funny and the pacing is really good. It's clear they didn't have a big budget but it doesn't matter. You can get away with that when you have good actors and a good script. They spun straw into gold with this one. Make sure you watch the DVD extras. I don't care for the extras on most movies but these really added something.",1412985600,,505,4.111111111111111
6658162,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"""Real Heroes"" uses the techniques of low budget reality TV shows - confessionals, getting the cast drunk, having everyone live in a cheap house in the Valley - to send up C-list celebrities while also paying homage to the traditions of comic book superheroes. Highlights are the bro-dude machismo of Hunter Smit as Big Shot, the deadpan comedy of Matt Palazzolo as Psychic Sam, and everything Melissa Jobe does as Sable, the one superhero who actually knows what she's doing. Great to see such a fun, funny superhero movie that's not made in a major Hollywood studio!",1412985600,,567,4.855670103092783
6658163,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"Great Movie! full of comedy and action, I was impressed with the illustrations, and the way a superhero movie, reality entertainment, and comic hero genres, were were pulled together to make this fun adventure.",1412726400,,210,5.205882352941177
6658164,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"Delightfully funny and campy to the extreme.  Our ""heroes"" have wonderful flaws that Keith Hartman has exploited to the max.  I groaned, I laughed, I groaned some more and enjoyed all the eye candy.  This movie is destined to become a cult classic.  It looked like the actors had a really fun time making this movie.  The alliteration in the narrative eventually got so extreme it became hilarious. Kudos to the cast and crew!",1412726400,4,426,4.702702702702703
6658165,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"I submit this review under ""confessions of a gay geek"" (yes, there are some of us out there!).

I can best describe this movie as Drawn Together meets George of the Jungle (the movie) meets Real World. While you can tell that this was a labor of love crafted on a small budget, its pushes for everything it can from that budget. For what would be mega dollar action scenes it uses alliterative narration (Oooh, big words!) with a campy, official sounding narrator spouting dialogue that ranges from the funny to the absurd. The narration is accompanied by some really great original illustrations to fill in the holes where the movies aspirations exceed its budget. That also means most of the live action takes place at the ""real world"" home of the heroes. Note that while there are plenty of gay references and innuendo going around, don't rent this expecting it to be an overtly gay movie (i.e. no gay love scenes, and only 2 Real Heroes are admittedly gay in the movie - Malibu Action Girl's 2 sidekicks). As one example of a funny and creative idea in the film - check out the ""Sidekicks Bar"" scenes where the heroes go to select and pick up sidekicks (two words: Lady Liberty - just watch it and laugh).

The entire ensemble is perfectly cast and you know they are having a blast playing their over the top roles (don't look for subtle in this movie). And of course what super hero movie would be complete without a dose of eye candy splashed in nicely by Water Boy (model Lars Slind) and hitting the target with Hot Shot (Hunter Smit).

The DVD is loaded with a ton of extras rarely found on small budget productions including short video interviews from many of the heroes and a very funny set of interviews with 2 male side-kicks (partners) of Malibu Action Girl. Watch their lava death trap short for some of the funniest dialogue from the collection when super boyfriends find out just how much they know about each other as they near a fiery death. Hot Shot's video shorts are another shining moment as he shares the adventures of looking for a Side Kick in all the wrong places. Watching the movie & shorts, I can't help but think this would be perfect material for a TV series. Hellooooo? Anyone in TV producer-land listening? ;-)

So if you are ready for a silly, funny, creative romp with a touch of the gay and super heroes - you found your DVD destination!!",1412640000,5,2375,4.529137529137529
6658166,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"I remember watching MTV's the REAL WORLD when it first came out. It was the first mainstream reality show like that and I lived for it. The house was fun but the people... were a mess.  Now the housemates are fun AND a mess,...of hyper bright spandex and man-candy. And as a nerd...it's the Justice League...rejects...at home...trying to be in the Justice League. There's a Malibu Action Whip. There's a guy who talks to fish...doesn't control them...just talks to them...and he's so pretty...who cares. This was a hoot!",1412553600,2,520,4.909090909090909
6658167,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"I got a copy a day before release by participating in the Kickstarter to get this produced.

One can tell it was made on a threadbare budget, but that should not detract from the obvious joy that went into the making of the movie.

We start with the auditions for superheroes for a Real World style reality show, winding up with two Himbos (including the paranoid Big Shot, who makes sure no one is in the bathroom [knife at the ready] before going), a psychic, Malibu Action Girl and Sable. Sable's daughter/ex-sidekick Vixen comes along for the ride.

The humor is broad and varied throughout, digging deeper into farce towards the end and the climatic battle between the heroes and the Supervillains.

While I liked Hartman's You should Meet My Son a bit more, this one is still a welcome addition to my collection.",1412208000,4,818,4.659722222222222
8678557,4,B00NJ3XXZO,Cute movie,1452211200,,10,4.5
8678558,2,B00NJ3XXZO,"I loved Keith Hartman's first movie ""You Should Meet my Son"".  It was funny inspired awesome.  This movie is pretty much AWFUL.  I mean it's so bad it wants to put me off on buying any movie by a gay producer or writer ever again.  I hope his next movie is better or that I can hope to watch it without paying full price for it and then being stuck with it....unless I re-gift it",1443312000,,379,4.013333333333334
8678559,1,B00NJ3XXZO,"terrible, amateurish movie.",1430352000,,27,8.333333333333334
8678560,4,B00NJ3XXZO,"I really can't say what got me to buy this movie..but I'm glad I did. let's be real honest here, very, very low budget, now academy award winning actors, no CGI, no breathtaking scenes. and that's all okay! I got more than a few laughs, I was very entertained, I got some real eye candy, what more can we ask for. The pitch is a producer is looking for superheroes to appear on his reality show, do they get Batman or Wonder Woman or Spiderman or Black Widow? No! they get Psychic Sam, Barbie Action Girl (I think) Sable etc. It is just a lot of fun Psychic Sam cracked me up always knowing what was going to happen, Sable is the older mom type who wants to get to work. 2 major hotties, Big Shot and the guy who can talk to fish. This movie is all in fun and that is how you have to watch it, don't try to critique it. Oh, and the 2 sidekicks, I adore them too.",1417219200,3,862,3.9884393063583814
8678561,4,B00NJ3XXZO,"Fun, cute, silly very entertaining.",1415404800,,35,6.2
8678562,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"This is a funny-send up of the superhero genre and our instant-celebrity culture. The movie plays with superhero archetypes (drawing mostly from movies, TV and cartoons) and presents them through the prism of basic cable reality TV. These are the kind of superheroes that belong more on Bravo than in Avengers Mansion. ""Real Heroes"" explore somes of the same territory as the Watchmen series, but delves into the funnier side rather than exploring the darkness, offering a humorous and candy-colored deconstruction.
The cast is a blast and the Sidekicks shine!",1413936000,2,560,5.233333333333333
8678563,4,B00NJ3XXZO,As the mother of aspiring actor Big Shot(aka Hunter Smit) I found myself chuckling and enjoying this first movie of his to be released on DVD. All the actors did an outstanding job at this tongue in cheek comedy poking fun at Reality TV. I hope it becomes a cult classic soon and the movie was well written and directed. A great stocking stuffer for the holidays.,1413504000,,363,4.432835820895522
8678564,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"I rarely write reviews,I never do,but this film is freaking hilarious! The cast is amazing,and the film overall was very well executed! There are so many one liners and the characters are just really great,definitely add this one to your collection!",1413072000,2,249,5.097560975609756
8678565,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"If you're a fan of super-heroes, reality TV, satire, mixed media, great one-liners this is the movie for you!  Zany characters meet zany plot.  The mix of reality TV asides and real-life scenes and fun art move the plot along quickly, with lots of laughs.  Each of the super-heroes has a unique powers, with the emphasis on 'unique'.  The casting is great, with a nice mix of actors and actresses of all ages and types.  I really recommend this to anyone who needs a lighthearted evening!",1412985600,3,488,4.627906976744186
8678566,5,B00NJ3XXZO,"Well done, yet another masterpiece, for all that I was unsure of the ""reality style"" it quickly became a moot point, and the humor was just point on!! Please give us more ..... Will be among the first to buy!",1412985600,2,208,4.225
