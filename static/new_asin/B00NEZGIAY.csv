8677627,5,B00NEZGIAY,"Janis Wilson Hughes of Evolution Stoneware is a wonderful and patient teacher with very detailed explanations of how one makes the Groovy Mugs. She actually shows you twice, how she forms the cylinder,  so you can see how they vary from one piece to another.  She has a nice calm (none chipmunk sounding), and none know-it-all tone.  She makes suggestions and allows for differences in folks' potting techniques.  For instance, at one point when showing how to throw a straight cylinder that precedes the actual making of the flowing movements, she acknowledges that some may have a problem with thickness at the bottom of a cylinders, so they could open to the wheel head and then use a slab for a bottom.  So, she doesn't maintain that her way is the only right way at all times.  Her background is in engineering - so she has a wonderful grasp of the physics of forming something right up until gravity takes over.  I really like the slumbering dogs in her videos, because you could see when she had edited and the dog had suddenly changed positions.  It made me smile that she did good editing to take out the redundant portions of a video.  She has a two camera set up, so you can see straight on and then she switches to great closeups, so you don't miss a detail that is important. Her first video was so good, I went on to purchase video 2, where she gives the recipes, etc. and then another video where she shows in detail how one makes tools out of one's own clay.  I have a stack waiting to dry. She is simply, a great instructor and idea person. Thanks Janis for your switch to pottery. I have known a former medical student who happened to take a course in ceramics and became a wonderful potter as well, teaching much like you do. Pottery is addictive, right!  What is daunting is that she stays so clean and tidy all the time, reminding me of an English pottery who always appeared with a shirt and tie, but then I saw her image on a Skutt Resource site in sepia tones, looking nice and sloppy and clay covered, like me, with the words: ""Disappointing Janet would be a bad thing"" and I felt much more comfortable. Janis responds to inquiries and doesn't leave the critical chocolate chips out of her cookie recipes...When I asked about a glaze, she responded that it needed a critical cool down phase programmed in. The kiln is currently firing, so we will see what happens. She also has a Youtube video showing folks who only have a manual kiln sitter how to do a cool down firing. Go look at it.",1455580800,,2512,4.439130434782609
