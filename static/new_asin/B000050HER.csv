7928918,5,B000050HER,"Having visited Preservation Hall twice, this disc brings back very fond memories. The disc is a must for all who like jazz; and even for those who don't.",1367712000,,153,4.5
7928919,5,B000050HER,"This is a wonderful video that captures the spirit of PHJB, created with the quality you expect from PBS.  The interviews with the players are a refreshing break from constant music and very informative.  I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about... as a soloist plays he is given a close-up and they all seem to be equally covered.  ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"" is definitely on there.  A real toe-tapping, uplifting video.",1269993600,,439,4.7368421052631575
7928920,2,B000050HER,"Two things get in the way of enjoying this DVD. First, and most annoying, is the trombonist who gets his face in front of other musicians to the point of distraction. And he is not very good. The second is that not all the numbers listed on the box are on the DVD. The most memorable is ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee"" which was my reason for buying the DVD -  not there.

An added comment is that the inane interviews get in the way of the music.",1243036800,,446,4.0
