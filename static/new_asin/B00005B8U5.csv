8274393,5,B00005B8U5,"Those insane aliens and the equally incomprehensible Earthlings are back for another go in volume two of the series that electrified Japan and struck the US back in the 1990s.  Follow the continued insanity with Ataru Moroboshi and Lum as they deal with high school and life in general, but with everyone else getting in the way.  Anime with a kick and you get to see how all this started.  :)",1402963200,,393,4.507042253521127
8274394,4,B00005B8U5,"Ataru Moroboshi has it tough. He's the most hated person in Nerima Ward, and surprisingly, it's not his lustful nature that causes this. It's all because of his association with the Oni(devil) alien Lum, who claims him as her husband. If she's not getting him in trouble at school, she's getting him in dutch with his real girlfriend, Shinobu. With the arrival of the Priestess, Sakura, perhaps he can be cured of his woes. Oops! Guess not. Between demonic possession, voodoo dolls, black holes, wacky priests, electric shocks, and yes, even time travel and lecherous dinosaurs, what is poor Ataru to do?
Well, I don't know about him, but I know what you ought to do. Buy this series!",1001116800,,684,4.756302521008403
8274395,5,B00005B8U5,"Like every anime from Rumiko Takahashi, Urusei Yatsura is just great.  This DVD contains episodes 5-8, and if you already watched DVD 1 (I guess you did), then you'll love this one, because it is even funnier than the previous one.
It's a pity AnimEigo is releasing each DVD bimonthly, if you want to watch all 196 episodes, you have to wait 8 years and a half to have all DVDs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We do hope they release all DVDs at once after they finish selling their boxsets.",996883200,2,474,4.5
