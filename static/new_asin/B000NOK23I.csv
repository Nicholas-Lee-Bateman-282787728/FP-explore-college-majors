8180007,1,B000NOK23I,"The Korean swordmaster demonstrates tamishigiri and kata while an english narrator quickly and briefly describes his movements.  The swordmaster never speaks, never show step by step movements, and never explains philosophy or origins of the Korean style.  Its a pretentious video displaying the Korean swordmaster's style and techniques. Don't waste your money.  You-Tube has more interesting and instructive videos.",1204848000,,417,6.033898305084746
8180008,5,B000NOK23I,"It is common misconception that you cannot learn from reading a book or watching a DVD however this DVD proves such ideas not to be quite correct. Based more on Korean sword methods this DVD gives even the dedicated novice the ability to learn the basic art of drawing and cutting using the sword. The DVD is excellent quality and well produced with still camera angels and alternate views and shot in a proper studio with correct lighting which put it way ahead of many of its competitors. It is by description a planned production when so much of these type of videos are turn on the camera and lets hope it works. This planned production is reflected in the discipline and exacting nature of the content.

The DVD shows mono techniques then combine these with two up techniques then cutting live targets all of which are based on practical life defense situation. Master Jin Kyu Seong demonstrates brilliant posture and excellent foot work and his Ki is obvious to those who know what to look for.  The DVD doesn't not cover multiply attackers

There are a lot of DVD's on the market in relation to using the sword but few reflect the quality and the professional nature of this one. I recommend it to those who want a more practical approach to using the sword. I particularly recommend to any instructors who live in isolation (as we do here in central Australia)and cannot attend the big city dojo's but would like to introduce some variations into their program. It is DVD you study then can go out and apply what has been seen. We eagerly wait the next installment.",1203206400,2,1573,4.610714285714286
