4044286,4,B0030DGHL0,"Hollywood has stooped to the `authentic"" gimmick that uses the suggestion of truth to make the audience feel involved in the film. Movies such as ""White Noise"", ""Blair Witch Project"" and the more recent ""Paranormal Activity"" had their successes through the suggestion of an actual event. There is just nothing more strong than the power of suggestion, writer director Olatunde Osunsami's ""The Fourth Kind"" actually takes a more aggressive route in directly challenging its audience to make a decision whether or not this story is true. The film incorporates supposed actual archival footage while having scenes re-enacted from the original documentary footage.

The film begins with an introduction from actress Milla Jovovich challenging the viewer whether or not to believe what they are about to see. The fact is there have been a lot of disappearances in Nome but the investigations by the Anchorage Daily News found no specific events to back up the claims of the film. What we do know is the fact that there are a lot of unsolved disappearances and unsolved deaths in and around the town of Nome, Alaska. Authorities have placed the blame on the frequent disappearances because of alcoholism and its remote location. It is also questionable whether Abigail Tyler is a real person or not (since the film states that they changed the names of some of the persons involved) and findings does say that she isn't real.

The film suggests the idea that Olantunde Osunsami has assembled footage about the mysterious case studies of psychiatrist Abigail Tyler, who had become a witness to alien visitation through her patients. What began as a study on sleep disorder becomes something more frightening. The documented alien possessions and strange activities come in the form of video footage, the film fills in the gaps through dramatic recreations (or so it suggests) with Jovovich as Abigail Tyler. Mixing together the so-called ""real"" footage and the dramatization scenes. The film seeks to make a thorough portrait of the actual Nome incidents that places its questions on the viewer to decide what is real and what is not.

I had to look into the film's background before I wrote this review, and yes, the movie is a fictional tale and relies on the powers of suggestion to immerse the viewer into its premise. Fact sheets were handed out to viewers on screenings that state that the writer heard of an Abigail Tyler and the disappearances in Nome through a friend. Tyler had recorded footage that depicts terrifying scenes and the director uses them side by side with the re-enactments that features Jovovich and Will Patton. It read that during fall of 2000, sleep studies were conducted that showed extra normal activities to the therapist. The film is a sensory one, and I remained open-minded to the suggestion that it may be real but I do know that the movie was fun and rather scary on some key scenes. I guess I should just focus on the film itself rather than trying to deliberate whether the movie is in fact based on real truth or not.

""The Fourth Kind"" may be a hoax or maybe it isn't...what is true and what isn't? This is the question that the filmmakers have to depend on to get its viewers invested in the film. Well, it is fictional but it is a fictional tale based on truth; I have seen enough documentaries that support this evidence. It may feel like a blatant stunt to pull off something like this, but the film does have several unnerving scenes and the way it suggests that some of the actual footages may be true does get the movie moving. The screenplay plays its cards right to give the film a noticeable distinctiveness, and the film is a clever attempt at originality. I somewhat wondered what it wanted to express at the 3-3:30 a.m. angle since most of the supposed 'invasion' happens during this time; is the movie also trying to convey a demonic possession?

The film is eager to play cerebral mind games with its viewer as it manages to sell the torment of psychiatrist Abigail Tyler as a woman devastated by the events in her life. Scientists have found no irrefutable evidence to the existence of extra-terrestrial life or are they just being covered up? I remain skeptical which probably why the movie was effective for me. Osunsami even follows some established scales of measurement in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". On this scale it states the first kind is ""sighting"", the second kind is ""evidence"", the third kind is ""contact"" and the fourth kind is ""abduction"".

The direction does feel a little overwhelmed with the manner that it juggles the so-called `actual footages' with the re-enactments. I felt a little bit of disconnection with some of the `shaky' camera movements and some scenes didn`t exactly feel like the movie was really occurring in Alaska. The film does have some very scary scenes of audio footages, video footages and the use of the ancient Sumerian language did send some chills down my neck. Of course, following the theories of alien presence, the actual footages gets fuzzy just before the scene's conclusion, leaving it up to the viewer to fill in the dots with the dramatization. There are several scenes of pure atmosphere but some of the suspense brought into the film is hampered by some of the performances we see onscreen. Will Patton was just so discordant as the town's sheriff. The film does emulate a small feeling of dread, the scenes with the supposed 'real' Abigail Tyler was interestingly well-conceived; she isn't as pretty as Jovovich and this makes her more accessible as to her supposed believability.  Milla Jovovich was good in the alternate role of Tyler, this is a different Milla from the one we've seen in ""Resident Evil"" films; this is Milla in a dramatic role, no kicks and no snazzy action scenes. Elias Koteas is the character who was skeptical and still is despite what he has seen, I guess the direction wanted to pitch in a clever device that the viewer may connect with. For a gimmick such as this to succeed, it needs the performances to feel authentic.

So is ""The Fourth Kind"" a hoax or not? Well, I went into the movie with no knowledge about the film's production, and it is fairly convincing; it is clever enough to capitalize on the power of suggestion. Maybe the footages are real and maybe they aren't; but one thing I know for sure is that the film's marketing gimmick just goes straight on to ask the audience to try and buy into the story. I would go so far as to say that the film's marketing gimmick is a hoax; as for the film itself, it may indeed be a hoax but it is the manner by which it executes the scenes that gives the viewer the sensation of fear. I guess it all matters on what you think or believe; myself I've seen enough documentaries on TV to say that the possibilities of alien existence may be endless. This is fact:  that there have been a very large number of disappearances and homicide in Nome, Alaska. FBI says that it is because of alcoholism and the harsh landscape is responsible. Fact 2: There has been sleep studies conducted in that area. Mumbo-jumbo or not, the film does provoke some thought, and provides a feeling of scary fun. The film can disturb on some levels especially if you're the kind who believes in alien abduction...

4044287,5,B0030DGHL0,"I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Being an experiencer myself I have undergone psychiatric and hypnotic therapies.
My experiences have been profoundly positive (mostly). What I don't comprehend is why anyone experiencing such horrific events wouldn't leave, or cease investigating the darkness alone?
I look forward to the DVD release and hope it comes with 2 discs and much more of Abigail Tyler's taped sessions.",1257552000,3,405,5.444444444444445
4044288,3,B0030DGHL0,"I thought parts of The Fourth Kind were interesting and will even admit that it gave me chills a couple of times, but I found myself thinking that most of the people claiming to have been abducted by little green men were either mentally disturbed, under the influence of alcohol or on some really freaky drugs. In fact, I just recently saw a show on one of the learning channels that talked all about the deadly combination of alcohol, the lack of daylight and the extreme cold of Nome, Alaska. The FBI even stated that the murders and missing people of Nome are attributed to this alone. Not that they would tell us the truth if aliens were really taking us in the middle of the night, but in this case it fits. On top of all this, I don't know if the ""real"" footage shown side by side with the actors was tampered with in any way. I also found it curious that it always went blurry or static when the really strange stuff would happen. If this footage has really been around for 9 years, it would have hit YouTube long ago. There was one bit of convincing footage (from a police officer's camera mounted on the dash of his car) that showed a dark craft of some kind flying over the house the same night the main character's little girl was abducted, or so she says. You can hear in the tape that the cop saw the UFO and says that he can see ""them"" taking the child.

The acting is fairly good. Milla Jovovich ditches her action heroine persona and delivers a decent performance, but Will Patton goes way over the top as the town sheriff and he seems out of place. As expected the people in the ""real"" footage are more convincing because they aren't acting for a future audience.

This will get a lot of comparisons to Paranormal Activity and the studio is probably wishing they released The Fourth Kind a couple of months before, but anyone interested in UFOs, alien abductions or just want to explore the unknown, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.

The scene where she cries about her daughter getting abducted might be the most terribly acted scene I've ever seen in my 27 years of life.

4044360,2,B0030DGHL0,"As an introduction before the film, we have Milla Jovovich looking deadpan into the camera telling us that the movie we are about to watch is real, based on true events. Most ""horror"" movies that make this spurious claim are basically discrediting themselves right there.
The film has ""actual taped footage"" of the supposed real life woman this happened to, telling her story. Then we have that intermixed with the film where Milla is playing this woman, acting out her story. I'm assuming they did this to make the film and story more convincing, but it just comes across as unnecessarily superfluous. It's silly enough that the whole story is completely FICTIONAL, and that they're lying by claiming it's true, but they have an actress who's supposed to be the real life woman and then Milla playing her....what's the point of having two actresses playing the same person when the whole thing is fake anyway? (obviously audiences are supposed to believe this footage and story is real, which would make it scary...hollywood really panders to the average person as a complete lowbrow).
If there are other life forms out there, which is possible considering how vast our universe is, they're more than likely too far away to ever be able to reach us. But why do they always have to be anthropomorphized? What if alien life forms were like nothing we could even comprehend? Or what if they were simple celled organisms? Why must they always be human-like, but not quite...just enough to be creepy and disconcerting or threatening (think Alien)...or cutesy and lovable (think E.T.). Because we're humans, and all we know our ourselves, what our minds create and project and what sells the most books or movies. Who would pack theaters to see a movie about aliens that turned out to be microscopic cells? No, it always has to be the sinister aliens come to enslave earth and it's inhabitants, or kill them. Or, the aliens that have come to rescue us and save mankind and make everything all better.

The woman playing the ""real"" doctor in the ""real"" footage is so annoying I wanted to choke her out in the first 20 minutes.  Picture the absolute worst granola eating, tree hugging, liberal loving, vegan you can conjure up and that would be her.  From her bug eyes to talking in slow motion I couldn't take it anymore.  I stuck it out to the end, like an idiot, only to NOT be surprised to see that she is, as I said all along, a complete nut job.  He husband realized it and killed himself...she couldn't handle it and went nuts.  This movie is beyond stupid...it's pure garbage.  Shame on Amazon for suggesting this when I was looking for more scary movies to add to my collection.  And those that gave this movie more than two stars...you're probably the same people that thought Blair Witch was good.

It uses actual footage of interviews and of sessions with the victims when under hypnosis.
The main character is played by 'Milla Jovoich' as 'Abbey Tyler'often in parallel with the main subject of the films story-line.
I have to say the film leaves you with many more questions than answers and many of the scenes are truly alarming.
At the end of the day it does come down to what you believe, there have without doubt been so many things down the years that just can't be explained.
I believe that we would be pretty arrogant to think that among all those millions of stars and planets even within our own galaxy there is no intelligent life elsewhere, whether lesser or far more advanced than ourselves.

Let's just say after the first section of interview with the ""real"" Dr. Tyler it was so obviously FAKE I actually looked it up, and sure enough the entire movie is just plain bulls***.

4044519,2,B0030DGHL0,"First of all let me start off by saying that I am a horror and sci-fi movie fanatic and watch a lot of movies in these genres. I am willing to give movies the benefit of the doubt a lot of times but this movie was just plain awful. At the very beginning they tell you that this movie is a recreation of true events and that they will cut in actual footage of the real events. The problem is is that the ""real footage"" is obviously acted as well.

Thats problem #1, problem #2 is that people act so unbelievably in this film it really will have you rolling your eyes. The fact that the Sheriff or the chief of police or whatever he is doesnt believe her despite the mountains of evidence and the corroboration of witnesses as well as one of his own officers is just too stupid to believe. Seriously, what does this guy need, the aliens to stand in front of the camera holding two forms of ID and a notarized letter from an attorney? They quite clearly have the events on film enough to see that this is real and hes still trying to tell her shes crazy and place her under arrest? How stupid do they think the audience is here?

Seriously by the end of the movie there is so much evidence that strange things are happening that it would be impossible to believe this wasn't happening. This movie is unbelievably stupid and the actors talking at the beginning and end about ""believe what you want to believe"" is so stupid its insulting. Seriously don't waste your time, this movie was bad enough for me to write my very first review on here so that hopefully, I can save someone else the time and frustration. I don't know what movie the rest of the reviewers were watching but whatever it is certainly not this movie and  Id like to see it because the way they describe it it sounds great.",1412294400,3,1787,4.281065088757397

4044543,2,B0030DGHL0,"In only got around to watching this midway through 2014 despite being interested in it since I saw the trailer before it launched in theaters.

I think it could have been really great if it hadn't tried so hard to be a documovie. Like Europa Report (another recent film which did this documovie style) I kept getting dragged out of the story and mood whenever they would splice in an interview with one of the people who the movie is based on or would use voice/ camcorder footage alongside the re-enactment. It only served to remind me that this isn't happening (even though I know they hoped it would have the opposite effect).

That aside, I am not a fan of shaky-cam filming in general (especially in movies like this which have mostly calm scenes). The actors playing the main characters did fine in the roles but most of the minor characters were pretty bad (thankfully their roles were small enough as to not distract for too long).

I can't really recommend it. Dark Skies, which is similar in plot, manages to be more immersive and succeeds with some visceral scares. That wasn't great either though.",1398297600,,1109,4.6479591836734695

Anyways, I call bull caca on this movie for making people watch poor acting and not even including the original cast member: Dr. Tyler.

4044564,2,B0030DGHL0,"Great acting and a good deal of suspense.  The problem I have with it is that towards the end, the film insults the viewer's intelligence.  You see, the movie is presented in a documentary / re-enactment sort of way.  At any given time, the 'actual' footage is coincided with the 're-enacted' footage simultaenously.  Interesting enough.  You would think that the raw footage would be a bit more realistic and it does seem pretty believable until the filmakers decided to incorporate the most overused Hollywood horror movie trick in the book.  The mouths on our horrified victims' faces open wider than a Kansas sinkhole.  I mean seriously, how many times have we seen this effect in horror?  It was freaky the first sixty seven hundred times starting with the movie 'The Ring' almost 11 years ago.  But enough is enough.  This alone, is what ruined the movie for me.

Other than the wonderful acting, especially from our depressed buggy eyed doctor telling her story on a T.V. special, the movie is decent enough for not having much special effects or action.  Personal accounts of alien abduction alone can send a tingle or two down the old spine.  I do think that the Sheriff's role in the movie was a bit over-dramatic.  He often shoots from the hip relying on coincidence and gut-feeling  rather than solid evidence.  At one point, he flips out and throws a chair through the doctor's bedroom wall.  I thought cops were supposed to be professional?

All in all, decent film.  I give it a very high 2.  Would have been a three had it not been for the people unhinging their jaws during hypnosis.",1386201600,,1600,4.707581227436823

Namely people who claim to have been abducted frequently reported seeing an ""owl"" before the abduction based on the psychological theory that the human mind has difficulty comprehending something far beyond normal comprehension and the mind attempts to rationalize something it cannot into something it can ~ regardless, the Sumerian language (our MOTHER-TONGUE) was very intriguing. I just wish the ending was a little more visible film-wise.

+ I really like the side-by-side ""actual"" video with the re-enactment, which was used to lend credibility to the scene

+ I thought the pace and story telling were just right.

+ The scary parts were scary and the re-enactments were believable.

+ I come from an upbringing/experience where things like white magic, black magic, possession and the like are real things in non-big city / non-Silicon Valley areas of the world. Thus this movie was more ""real"" to me than probably would be for my neighbors.

> Yes, the film makers have a visual approach to Nome, Alaska as a big valley surrounded by mountains, but Google satellite shows differently. The fact that the real place is flat, cold and isolated is almost more suspenseful than the picturesque town used in the movie. But I guess if you start the moving thinking, ""Oh, look what a beautiful town. I want to go there,"" then watch the movie. . .well you don't want to go there now. They went for appearances can be deceiving.

+ For those wondering, Milla is not her butt-kicking, sexy self in this movie. Rather, she does a great job of playing the terrified victim caught in an impossible situation.

If Universal was coming up with a tricky way to scare the crap out of people through creating the illusion that what happens in this film is real....Well, that's entertainment. But for me this isn't scary. I love aliens. I don't find them scary at all. Not the ones that appear to be the closest to reality, with the guitar pick shaped heads and black eyes. Not sure I would want to be probed in my nether regions, so as long as they kept their perverted little naughty martian hands to themselves I suppose they could pick me up and set me down somewhere else a few days later. Might be kind of fun. Anyway, beside the point. Who cares if this is a clever scheme to scare you? Orson Welles did it in the 50's and he's considered a genious for pulling it off so well.

There are films that often include ""Based on actual events"" or ""Based on a true story"" in their opening credits. However few of these are truly all that accurate.

4044596,4,B0030DGHL0,"""The Fourth Kind"" is ostensibly about alien abductions, but it's really a mockumentary-style film that tries so hard to convince you it's real that it works.  ""The Fourth Kind"" doesn't need to be authentic, it just needs to sow enough doubt about its veracity to scare you.  And in that regard ""The Fourth Kind"" succeeds in spades.

The movie begins with a televised interview from Chapman University with psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler (Charlotte Milchard/Milla Jovovich), retelling her close encounter in Nome, Alaska in October 2000: Tyler's husband Will (Julian Vergov) is murdered in his sleep, leaving behind two children, little Ashley (Mia McKenna-Bruce) and recalcitrant Ronnie (Raphael Coleman). Tyler is fond of hypnotherapy (it seems she has no other tools of psychology at her disposal) and soon discovers that under hypnosis every patient sees a white owl staring at them but can remember little else.  But they DO eventually remember, and the dredged up memories so horrify Tyler's patients that one of them (Corey Johnson as Tommy Fisher) goes on a murder-suicide spree.

The white owl is no owl of course, and the aliens invoked by the title have a habit of kidnapping people while they're being recorded: on camera, in a Dictaphone, or even under hypnosis. ""The Fourth Kind"" is smart enough not to rely on a SFX budget and instead prefers to let the evidence speak for itself - mostly blurry cameras, inhuman voices, and lots of terrified screaming. Although ""The Fourth Kind"" is supposedly about alien abduction, it has a surprising amount in common with demonic possession films.  That's a compliment - see ""The Astronaut's Wife"" for a similar attempt that goes horribly awry.

""The Fourth Kind"" plays a clever shell game with our expectations by casting Milla Jovovich as Charlotte Milchard who is playing Dr. Abigail Tyler.  The film makes much ado about the distinction between the actress playing Tyler and the ""real"" Tyler by showing them on a split screen or overlapping their dialogue. ""The Fourth Kind"" never lets you forget that this is a dramatization of a supposedly real event, and reminds you so much that after a certain point the sheer audacity challenges your skepticism.

""The Fourth Kind's"" biggest flaw is its strength: the plot is ludicrous. Sheriff August (Will Patton) relentless skepticism strains credulity, particularly in light of the numerous disappearances of the townsfolk.  Either Tyler is a serial killer who should be locked up or there's really some merit to her abduction theories, but August never settles on a decision other to bully her whenever she's vulnerable. This is one of those films where nobody ever actually speaks in plain English or thinks to spin the tale in a way that might be believable to law enforcement.  It's also one of those films where a Sheriff seems to have the entire judicial system at his disposal such that he can take away one of Tyler's children after the other is abducted. It's a parent's worst nightmare, even if it doesn't really make any sense.

But even though the plot isn't coherent, Milchard's stilted acting isn't very good, and the film never provides any answers, ""The Fourth Kind"" plants enough seeds of uncertainty that you'll be looking it up on the Internet. And in that regard it makes for a very effective horror movie.",1362268800,,3325,5.003623188405797

I watched this using Amazon's Instant Video service which worked flawlessly.  I was okay with the picture quality but it's still not truly HD (maybe 720p, which I guess technically could be called HD).  Let's give the service itself 4 stars.  Now, the movie...not good.  I'll give it 2 stars and it'll average everything to 3 stars overall.

""The Fourth Kind"" sets up the scary, shared abduction premise and then falls flat on its face with the directorial choices of split screen and claimed ""real"" video snippets of abductees under hypnosis. All of these decisions are wrong and frustrating. It's probably because the claim of ""real"" footage is so blatantly ridiculous here. The footage is a little scary but why reproduce something with Mila Jovovich supposedly acting it out as opposed to the real thing?!? Did she have one more film to do to fulfill her contract?

4044630,5,B0030DGHL0,"I've always enjoyed watching good documentaries related to aliens ever since my sister & I saw a peculiar object in the sky when we were children from our back yard. We lived in Queens NY between LaGuardia & JFK, we knew what planes looked & soundd like (every shape, size, # of propellers, helicopters heading to Manhattan, etc.) but this was different.  No sound, just hovered then changed direction & zipped through the syk & was gone. If you are a netflix member they have the ancient aliens series.  Out of approximately 10 episodes I most definitely recommend watching the first 5. The rest just seem to repeat the same info over & over.

Back to this movie...It was excellent, creepy & bone chilling. Made me wonder if what the church has always deemed to be exorcisms have been in fact alien abductions. It leaves me wondering why? As humans we only use about 3% of our brain capacity...Makes me wonder what the rest has stored, has seen or experienced, has purposely locked away (or been forced to lock away). Our DNA is a code, particles at their lowest level are code, the more we learn maybe we will be able to unlock the key (& message) from our past to our future?

Now, there has always been 1 fact that will never shake my belief in aliens. My father has a cousin who worked for NASA, he has been retired now for more than 20 years. To this day & for the rest of his life he has an FBI security detail with him 24/7. When my sister last saw our cousin they were in a restaurant near Beverly Hills,California (FBI sat in their car just outside the restaurant window where he was visible to them & vice versa).  He lives in Beverly Hills in a beautiful mansion next to movie stars...just so you understand what his pay grade was & how high level he was.  My sister asked him, ""so, do aliens really exist?""..He gave her a small smile, a twinkle in his eye & said, ""I'm not at liberty to have this discussion."" If the answer was no, why not just say no? My guess, his response was a yes, although he never muttered the words.

This movie leaves you with the same question that scientists & people alike have asked...are we alone? I SERIOUSLY recommend Ancient Aliens specifically due to the Sumarian language & the star called sirius. How we have managed to somehow hold a rendition of it's solar system for thousands of years when it is not visible with the naked eye & has only been discovered in the last 20 years or so. How would we know what it's solar system looks like or how it functions unless the knowledge came from somewhere else? The tiny planet where the rendition originates from is barely visible with current technology.",1347494400,,2649,4.449484536082474

4044635,5,B0030DGHL0,"I gotta hand it to the filmmakers of this film, they weren't worried about following any rules of standard movies. In fact, from the start, they break the fourth wall with talking directly to the audience and states that, in the end, it's up to the individuals watching to decide what they will believe. One rule broken is to present any movie that's based on any true story as though it is happening in real life, instead, they do a split- they show the re-enactment alongside a homemade interview tape to show how close the acting is to the reality of it.
Storywise, it's pretty much straightforward, if not askewed at first. A psychologist has a hypnotism done on her to figure out what she can't remember about her husband dying. Finding out that there's a small town where people are having strange encounters that can't be explained, she travels, with her blind daughter and cynical son, to said town to perform hypnotisms to see what each person can recall. What they recall is very eerie, completely surreal. And, at times, very frightening. And what really gets her is the common threads through each story. Things get from askewed to plain-out bizarre after one patient gets so paranoid, that a tragedy happens. And from there, everything spirals out of control. Videos shown from the videos that recorded them show very strange things happening (that is, if you can see them happening beyond the EM-induced distortions). Probably the part that really got me was a possession lifting a man out of his bed and speaking in an ancient language. Usually, in possession films, a possessed person speaks Latin or Hebraic. In this case, it's one of the oldest languages in written history- Sumerian, which made this even stranger. And the ending confrontation with a hypnotism-induced possession was, by far, among the creepiest, spine-chilling moments I've ever seen in such a movie, and the first ever in a pseudo-sci-fi/mockumentary film. No matter what you believe- that UFOs are a joke of a hoax, that they're real and out there, that they're demons with technology, whatever else- this has the possibility to get people to think about the possibility of things beyond the realm of the normal. If you can call reality normal.",1343606400,,2233,4.878947368421053

Talk about lazy filming. And don't EVEN try to explain that Whitley Strieber made a conenction between aliens and owls, so you know, it's kinda, sort, almost, like, y'know ok.  Coz it's not. The actors do ok, except for the reanimated cadaver they used to play the ""real"" Doctor whatsername.

But this is one that I felt deserved it because it has less than 5 stars for the average rating
an to me is a five star film.

Now going into this movie I didn't expect much. I thought we were going to see a blair witch project film
but with aliens . Only reason I even watched it was because I recently seen something in the sky I couldn't identify that had an impact on several towns in my area. Didn't know any good films on the subject and a guy recommended this to me, an I found it for only a couple bucks on here so decided why not.

Well as it started out it at first looked like I was going to be write about it. But with in the first 10 mins of the film I started to see this was like no other movie I've ever seen before .
The story is very interesting, has some facts and evidence that something truly happened to the people whom this film is based off of.  For the reenactment part of the movie it the actors were spot on, an when they were crossing real life video with movie footage the mix was perfect to the second and to the slight nuances of the voice's .

I don't feel I should even attempt to explain the story to you. Others likely could do that better than I , but I feel it's almost impossible to explain what this film is with words.

But the fourth? that involves abduction.

""The Fourth Kind"" suggests that many people have been abducted by aliens or higher beings frequently and are unaware of the encounter themselves. in the film, the psychologist uses hypnosis combined with other psycho-therapeutic techniques to unravel the ""UFO"" mystery , only to eventually find herself on the other end of her psychiatric couch.

A Few things and keep in mind I loved Blair Witch.

1. Her son (or her not son) knows what reality is and what's make believe (re: estranged)
2. There are, clinically, mentally deranged people among us; all over, everywhere.
3. There are places we put those seriously ill folk.
4. If you believe that a white beam came from the sky, go seek professional help.
5. If you have marks on your body and you believe an entity placed it there; get help. Don't drag your loved ones around you into your charade and fantasies.
6. If you are keen to make others aware that you have emphatically been abducted by something from another world: please, please listen to Coast2Coast AM with the quacks that call into that show; talk about the Jerry Springer of E.T.
7. Naturally, NATURALLY, as soon as something 'other worldly' happens, naturally, the video goes all scrambled and we get the image of what APPEARS to be terrifying, or the mouth opened to epic proportion not unlike the kids that died in their fixed horrifying expressions in 'The Ring'. Of course the camera in the cop car would flicker in and off like that, of course it would be that FRISBEE like appearance over the house, of course anytime some sort of evidence presents itself, its anything but evidence, its all theory; LMAO, honestly, seriously, they couldn't do better than that. The crackers who made all these stories up and the people making this film, this is the best they can do: a Skyscraper sized disc in the air and levitation? LMAO....oh please, stop, my gut, oh no my gut lmao.

You charlatans, you farcical behemoths of make believe. The charlatan lady doctor (doctor LMAO) is a certifiable nut, and he daughter is no doubt in some river bed six feet under. Look at the women, look at her. She looks like one of millions of drawings of the elongated faces of what an alien might look like. She looks like an advanced patient dying of Aids. I don't know if that last tape of her in her wheelchair is camped or not; it certainly looks that way the way the horrible interviewer was at that two bit university, but that is neither here nor there. The very fodder of this all is its complete and utter nonsense, and well apparently it is supposed to be. I go into a movie like this, always thinking its real, it makes it more fun, but the mother and african american guy really made you know from jump street how set up it was, and that was sad.

However, it was very entertaining, very. But for me, that where it ends. If you believe that people get abducted by something no one has ever seen, ever, only blurred images always, always nonsense looking photos and ridiculous 'blurred' objects, enough already, really, enough. There is no big foot, there is no Lock Ness nonsense, and you all need to come back from your life vacation in loonville.

At least they all got it right with the boy, If I had a mother like that, that said my sister was abducted, I'd make certain she was put away and kept away. The women portrayed is a threat to all of you hoping for a signal from an ancient world. I am surprised she isn't a Christian, as they too are like her, spreading their vicious poison as well based on nothing but myth and nonsense.",1326844800,,3348,4.6661016949152545

The filmmakers do try out something different.  That is, paring up real documentary footage (I think) with actors replaying the same scenes at the same time.  While it's a bit disconcerting, it does give the film a sense of reality...or does it?  I was fairly entertained but at the same time never really cared about the characters much.  I spent a lot of time looking at Milla Jovovich and thinking how much more attractive she is than the real woman she was portraying.  In the end, the film may have great appeal if you believe in UFOs and abductions.  If you think that premise is all bunk, you will think this movie is too.  Me?

4044652,3,B0030DGHL0,"Not to be left behind by the indi/docu buzz boat that set sail this year, Paramount and Columbia already enjoying the tropical breeze atop the deck,  Universal pictures looked to their marketing department to conjure up a makeshift raft that will excuse their lack of punctuality to the box office party.

Enter newcomer Olatunde Osunsanmi's science fiction thriller, The Fourth Kind.  I would suspect that, by now, most of us are aware of the ambiguous and relatively clever trailers depicting unsettling bits of raw, fuzzy footage injected into the seemingly more typical scenes that largely boil down to neurotic folks talking about owls.

Yes, this film has been marketed heavily and, yes, it's a bit of a disappointment, but only because the glimpses of real brilliance underscore the entire project, to an extent that these fleeting moments elevate the film from mundane shock-fest, to an intriguing and intelligent take on the saturated extraterrestrial subgenre.

Similar to Neill Blomkamp's masterful District 9, this movie does take advantage of its mockumentary style more often than not; unfortunately, the results are often mixed, occasionally presented in a fashion that is more tedious and redundant than immersive.  Osunsanmi and his team took very sincere strides to create a truly unique presentation that, at the very least, is respectably clever and, at its best, shockingly unsettling in its pseudo authenticity.  Although I remain skeptical, this is a vision that has been largely realized, and its power will often surprise you.

Still, the avant-garde elements need to know when to keep their heads down and let the audience be scared for the sake of the imagery, not from what me may or may not see through a hail of static and white noise.  The exercise of ""the audience fears what it doesn't see"" has been taken to extremes here, but it offers us so little in return that we are often left in hazy frustration at the lack of a payoff.  If Shayamalan had it wrong when he gave us a detailed look at his extraterrestrial, Osunsanmi went to the other end of the spectrum, which is equally as irresponsible.

Given the lean amount of substance that the actors had to work with, performances are quite strong.  Milla Jovovich does her best as the leading actress in an uncanny role and, while it may fall short of the height of her career, her portrayal of a woman stripped of everything she loves is solid, if not commendable.  While the rest of the team largely falls to the wayside, Enzo Cilenti and Will Patton stand out as citizens of the small town struggling with the atrocities occurring.  Patton, especially, sinks into his role like butter as a harrowed chief of police, and Cilenti steals what is, arguably, the biggest scare of the movie.

Ultimately, the satisfaction arises not from the scattershot scares and performances but, rather, Osunsanmi's ability to take an overdone concept and, just nearly, turn it on its head.  The end result is a feeling that many likely won't have felt for some time:  That the enigmas remain open to debate among skeptics and proponents alike, no matter what may arise from either party.  It's a disturbing notion that will spark debate and stay with you long after you've left the theatre and, by that regard, The Fourth Kind is a modest success.",1324166400,2,3316,4.912186379928316

I know that the ghost shows on television are scripted and are made for entertainment purposes. To be fair, once you've been in real paranormal situations for as long as I have, what the media shows you is made to be so much over the top that everything you see is all pretty humorous.

But this movie did not make me laugh. Not at all. Sure, I know that it is all bogus and that the ""real"" footage was also faked. I watched the Extras on the DVD.

4044662,4,B0030DGHL0,"There are plenty of reviews for this film, so let me just say that the sound clips during the credits freaked me out! There were multiple descriptions of something I witnessed 10+ years ago.

I saw a low flying aircraft that was following alongside the road I was on. It was a populated area, so it really caught my attention before I was anywhere near it. I thought it might be a search helicopter or a pilot in trouble. I was close to home so I became very concerned that something major was going on. I thought there might be a dangerous fugitive or an impending plane crash, and I was very worried about my family.

It suddenly stopped, so I turned my car around and pulled into a parking lot. It was right there, hovering above the buildings and trees. It was large and rectangular with a flat underside. There was a white/yellow downward spotlight, and it had had smaller lights as well (I think at least one was red). I saw it perfectly clear and I was awestruck.

Then it suddenly went from standing still to rushing away. I went home, ran inside and plastered myself to our picture window. There were three lights moving away in the distance, and they were so bright that I was able to see them for about 30 minutes before they were too far away to be visible.

I have no idea if those phone recording are real or fake, but it definitely blew my mind to hear a word-for-word description of what I saw! I live near a military base, so I've always kept in mind that it could have been a military aircraft I simply wasn't familiar with.",1312416000,2,1542,4.34375

Milla Jovovich plays a hypnotherapist in Nome, Alaska, who, in 2000, allegedly discovered that some mighty strange things had begun happening to the residents of the town, incidents very possibly extraterrestrial in nature.  The movie mixes re-enactments of the events at the time with audio and video recordings purportedly showing us actual, first-hand accounts of those events - although anytime anything of any real interest or significance starts to occur, the sound and images conveniently go to static.

Some believe it is caused by the winters, which tend to affect people in strange ways.  The makers of this movie portray the cause as Alien Abductions. I've seen my share of alien movies, but this flick cranks it up a notch, as its possession scenes rival ""The Exorcist"".

In a way the message is to be taken seriously.  Not all Aliens are like ET, which was invented by Spielberg. If a species is a different life form, there is no ""Earthly"" reason why it would have the higher attributes attributed to man, such as empathy or compassion.

She soon learns that all of their stories  mirror eachother. Although these people believe their problems with sleeping vand dreams is unigue to them, they are all relating the same events.

If you have ever watched movies or read books about aliens, she looked more freighting than the little grey aliens. I did not think the footage of her being interviewed looked authentic and special effects can make any footage look like ""authentic"" footage. I also had trouble with the aliens speaking Sumerian. I am very open minded on this subject, however, I did not find it believable.  I have been reading and ""researching"" UFO's and aliens' for a very long time, and I have never heard of or read about this. I am not an expert, but I think I would have come across this by now if it was in anyway authentic. You can google this and you find nothing on it.

4044672,4,B0030DGHL0,"THE FOURTH KIND

This was a very interesting film in the way that it was presented mixing in the acting with the so called real footage. I have to say that it was pretty effective especially if you went and seen this in theaters. If the footage is real or not really has no effect on how one watches this, the fact that it is implied is real puts that thought in your mind for as long as you watch it. Question all you want after and go find out the truth later but during the film it is quite effective in my opinion. In fact the marketing for this film is actually brilliant, I commend the filmmakers for that, the ""Fargo"" of Alien films [get it].

The film starts with an introduction from star Milla Jovovich as she goes on to say this is a true story and actual footage and audio will be used in the film. After that we are off as Dr. Abigail Tyler sees patient after patient that are having trouble sleeping and remembering things except for an owl. So she offers a suggestion to each in order to help them out, hypnosis. Things start to go very wrong in the Alaskan town of Nome after she starts this including her own problems haunting her more and more, like the death of her husband.

I don't think I am giving anything away by saying this film is about Aliens since the title already tells you that. If you were not aware there are four kinds of encounters with Aliens, this obviously being about the fourth. The four levels were created by UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek and they are as follows here. The first is just a sighting of UFO's and such the second being a sighting but with physical effects, the third is basically contact and of course the fourth being abducted, this was added by a direct associate of Hynek. More levels have been added by other people but the first four are the ones generally accepted by UFO enthusiasts.

The film its self is actually pretty good with the added thing of ""this is true"" lingering over it. Then on top of that the fact that they said footage and audio that appears on screen sometimes is real adds to the feel of the flick. Regardless of it being true or not it does add a little something to it. There are some particular moments in this film that are very real feeling and some actual scary ones as well. I would love to talk about one in particular but I would be giving to much away to any one who hasn't seen this.

Performance wise I would like to say that I actually liked Milla Jovovich in this and thought she actually fit the role. I have read some things about her in this film that have been negative but I thought she was pretty good here. Will Patton as always was brilliant as the sheriff who does not believe a word of anything she has to say to him. But out of everybody I was most excited to see Elias Koteas in this film since he is one of my favorite actors. As I thought he was great here as Milla's character's own teacher and therapist.

It is interesting to note that Nome Alaska really does have a crazy amount of missing people that the FBI did really go and investigate, the findings were alcoholism and the climate in which they live. This film will make you think and think about different things, like is this film really based on true events. Or is the ""real"" footage and audio really real, but mostly it will make you think about what might actually be up in the sky at night. And if there is really something there will it come visit you any time soon.",1302739200,,3444,4.258409785932722
4044673,2,B0030DGHL0,"There are two ways people experience reality. One is to project a physical sensorium into an alternate reality, the way of spiritualists. That is what this film portrays.

The other is direct experience of the fundamental nature of existence without a self. Fundamentally, everything experienced is a construct of our own mind, including what we call a self.

There is no doubt of the intensity of the experiences recounted in this film. There is no doubt of the intensity of the experiences we call a life.

When I wake up in the morning I remember my dreams, in which I had a body, a set of circumstances and the memory of a life, just like this one I call ""reality"". Which one is ""real""?

I am a classical pianist. Sometimes in my dreams I am perfectly playing a piece I only sight-read but never learned. In my dreams I can fly, it's so easy and slips through my fingers as I awake. I can also speak Greek and Latin in my dreams. Is Sumerian so far-fetched?

It is necessary to loosen the bounds we place on the conception of self.

I wish I could help the author and those of similar disposition.

Actually, I can.

It was kind of unique how the director interviews the ""real person"" (who's obviously just an actress), and how it has a double-screen effect when it shows the film and the ""real"" footage. I have to say, parts of the film were actually scary, like when you hear the alien and those ""abduction"" scenes. It seems like the director really wanted us to believe that it was real. In some ways, it kind of worked, but it ultimately didn't work. It just looked fabricated. The movie didn't end well either. Altogether, this film is really obnoxious and not anything that you can watch over and over again.

4044675,1,B0030DGHL0,"This alien abduction film made me glad that I am a scholar of rhetoric.  Jovovich appears at the onset sans character, informing the viewer that what follows is ""based on true events,"" but the names and the professions of those involved have been changed to protect their identity.  Then in true Blair Witch style, allegedly ""true"" video recordings of psychoanalysis sessions as well as police dashboard cameras are interwoven into the film to add to the documentary-style feel.  So the logical question becomes, ""why change the names if you're going to show their faces?""  Don't care if I'm a spoiler, but ain't none of it real, folks.  Through a bit of ""rhetrickory,"" the film can accurately be labeled as ""based on true events.""  There are people who have indeed claimed to have been abducted by aliens and portions of the film play out according to these reports.
But the cases portrayed in The Fourth Kind never happened.  Period.  If it had, I guarantee that everyone would know about it by now because abduction researchers would finally have the hard evidence they've been so sorely lacking for so many years.  Don't you believe it.  Sensationalized, manipulative, and bereft of ability.  It is inaccurate as documentary and ineffective as thriller.  While I am not yet convinced of the phenomenon of alien abduction, please don't anyone base their decision on the reality of the reports based on this movie.

On the plus side, it was a nice touch to have the aliens speaking Sumerian.  Ancient Astronaut theorists (which I am not, not really, anyway) have long held that humanity's first recorded contact with extraterrestrials was in Sumeria.

This movie claims to contain archived footage, the only footage that could be real is a couple of the hypnosis scenes, First off, the ""real"" Abbey Tyler is played by  Charlotte Milchard, This alone debunks the movie. Plus the fact that no law enforcement agency would release those video clips for a movie, they could have been leaked, but we all know that leaked vids take no time to get on youtube.

Both of those police car clips showed scenery, buildings, and landscape that was identical to the reenactment. I know your thinking ""maybe they filmed right where it happened"" no they didn't they filmed in Bulgaria and Squamish Canada. Neither place bears any visual similarities to Nome Alaska,not to mention how would everything look that close to the same being filmed 9 years later?

My other question is that since everyone in Nome gets abducted by aliens without their memory of it, how come no one has a dog in the house to freak out when the aliens enter the room? I know I am kinda crazy ""what about the dogs!"" But seriously, it is Alaska everyone has a dog, except if you live in Nome.

The movie begins with Milla Jovovich walking up to the camera and explaining that she will be portraying the real Abbey Tyler. Tyler is a psychologist who documents the events with her video camera and tape recorder.

The film includes the ""actual video and audio recordings"" to make the film more authentic.

Something is happening with the residents of Nome, Alaska. At least 3 people are having trouble sleeping. They wake up around 3:33 AM and claim they see an owl looking at them. It's just that they don't think it's an owl.

We learn, through the video recordings that these poor people have had a very traumatic experience and Tyler begins to believe they may have been abducted by aliens.

Will Patton plays the sheriff who is having a hard time keeping the peace of his town. He ends up revealing some troubling news to Abbey Tyler concerning her husband. (Who was also involved with this disturbing investigation)

The movie takes a troubling turn when, while under hypnosis, a patient appears to be possessed by whatever creature is terrorizing the town. Near the end, Tyler herself appears possessed.

As the movie progressed and Milla's character did more investigating of what the patients said, the tension racheted up.  Once she realized that the situation was over her head, she brought in several other experts as reinforcements and the tension really rose.  Then, Milla and the other experts realized that they too were vulnerable and things were coming to an inevitable climax. The boiling point was surprising and unexpected.  At the end of the movie I felt as drained and helpless as the main characters.  Overall it was a good move - not excellent, but good and enjoyable.  The scariness was more from tension than action.

Whirling the camera around a stationary actor isn't wizardry. In fact, it's annoying. So is the technique of having characters whisper. This may be groovy when you see a film in a quiet theater, but when you're at home and coping with planes flying overhead, the dishwasher, a dog snoring and other distractions, WHISPERING SUCKS.

We watched this movie last night, hoping for some of the atmosphere and fright typical of a ""Fringe,"" X Files,"" or ""Twin Peaks"" type of experience. The premise that Nome, Alaska, has become a special zone for alien abductions and how those abductions affect the victims and those around them is a solid idea. Pitting those with insights into what appears to have happened with the forces of rationality and authority makes for a tried and true archetypal conflict. Creating a gestalt that ""what you are seeing is real but the names have been changed"" is another standard artifice now in vogue among moviemakers.

The sets were good, though Bulgaria as a stand-in for Nome seemed a bit perhaps gentrified at times. Borrowing the notion that ""the owls are not what they seem to be"" from Twin Peaks was a good use of a conceit that certainly has merit.

The problems are not with the premise, but rather the execution. Cluttering the screen with ceaseless, annoying reminders that we are seeing or hearing actual footage or sound, offering split-screen takes on the same seen, and using a more or less disembodied head of the lead actor to induce us to suspend or redirect belief in the opening scenes all became contrived annoyances. The pacing of the scenes and dialogue all seemed forced and rushed to the point that all the oxygen and spontaneity were sucked from the film. Everyone and everything is harrowing, overdone, and sullen to the point that I was rooting for the owls to win the day, or rather the night.",1292630400,,1784,4.639240506329114

The footage may be fake, and I would suspect it to be so because you never know what the horror industry will do to make things more dramatic; and believing what is happening is real is frightening, so who knows! As a researcher on these types of things I will say that a lot of what is found in this movie is true. Yes, the Sumerians do talk about flying vehicles as well as suited space men that visited Earth. Yes, the Sumerians did have a word for rocket; shem. Yes, there are millions of people who see ufo's all over the world. Yes, there are very well documented cases that, with what is called hypnotic regression (using hypnosis to go back in time to an event in this or another life time), have startling stories of people being abducted by aliens and having no one believe them. Take the case of Barney and Betty Hill. They were abducted in the 60's. They went through regression and told parallel stories, yet their doctor said they were hallucinating. He couldn't handle this type of information of beings coming down and messing with humans.

As far as the Sumerian language is concerned in 1987 we did have a great knowledge of the Sumerian language. Zecharia Sitchin, the founder of the now popular Anunnaki theory of the Sumerians, has been running through tablet after tablet for years. If he got hold of the tapes he could have helped these people out, so I think perhaps these tapes were edited. But really, who knows?

I am taking a middle ground here. These events do go on; aliens taking humans up. Yes these pieces of footage look ""too good to be true."" So what will I say about this case? I would not use it due to the many speculations against it due to the fishyness of hollywood. I will not think of this case as either proof OF or AGAINST the theory of extraterrestrials but I will admit...what are the likely hoods of this NOT happening to the human race? I think they are much slimmer than the likely hood of it actually happening (for many reasons I take this position).

The main character played by Milla Jovovich and the director of the movie are in a sequence (out of character) and simply outright lie to the viewer that what they have witnessed is true and ""believe what you like"", but here are the FBI statistics, blah, blah blah. This somewhat ruined the experience, because if some of the things took place in real life, they would have made front page news of every city across the globe. It would not be possible for anyone to hide what is portrayed in this movie.

Although there are serious holes in the plot, the movie is reasonably well acted and the pace is good. There are some obvious logical flaws in the actions that take place (like many thriller type movies), and some of these are extreme. The fundimental flaw I noticed right from the beginning is that a psychologist or any other mental health professional would probably not be allowed to continue treating patients when their husband had just been murdered in front of them (but not really) and said mental health professional was unable to explain or understand what had happened. What the hell?

Anyway, interesting idea, but ruined somewhat by the director's charade.",1289347200,,1528,4.784090909090909
4044691,5,B0030DGHL0,"..but it's still scary.  The whole ""based on actual events"" trick is standard for horror movies.  As long as one character is based on a real person, they can claim the whole story is based on truth, even if it's a complete fabrication.  The word for this is ""fiction"" and it's a concept with which many reviewers seem to be unfamiliar.  Everyone's getting hung up on this, but it's the movie's central conceit.  You need to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy it; taking a tip from HP Lovecraft, the filmmakers have fabricated ""real"" documents to bolster the illusion of reality in their story.  They had me fooled for a while, but the real tip-off was (SPOILER) the police footage of the murder-suicide by the first hypnosis patient.  No police department in the Western world would ever release video footage of people being killed, and no responsible studio would use such footage in a major release.  It had to have been staged; if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD you will see that it obviously WAS staged.  This calls all the other ""archival"" footage into question.  If you're still uncertain, then the big reversal at the end should tip off the average-intelligence viewer that they've been watching a hoax.

But what a hoax!  Condemning this movie for ""lying"" to you is to miss the point.  It's not a documentary; it's a psychological horror film.  One of the most effective ones I've seen in years.

The movie is well edited, beautifully shot .. the story is well constructed .. even though it plays on all the old alien-abduction cliche's, it seems to manipulate the archetypes effectively.  The abduction experience is something that actually happens to people.  What's uncertain is whether these are objectively ""real"" or intense hallucinations.  Whatever causes them, there is no doubt that people all over the world DO have these experiences, and that fact scares the heck out of me.  Though I groaned at the ridiculous ""aliens speaking ancient Sumerian"" bit (just too much to swallow, I'm sorry) the shots of the owls gave me genuine chills .. and most of the time this movie actually unsettled me.  Few films these days can actually do that.  I was impressed.",1288828800,,2183,4.798927613941019

Little by little, Tyler becomes increasingly frightened herself, and begins to believe their stories, and then that she and her whole family are victims of abduction.

4044698,2,B0030DGHL0,"In the wake of `Paranormal Activity' and it's huge following, this little copycat film (which isn't really a copycat but is often regarded as such) came out to lukewarm, almost cold reception.  Still, I wanted to see it.  I am often disappointed in these alien films, but my search for something truly terrifying usually leads me to at least watch it once.

""If I could turn back time...""

Elements within `The Fourth Kind' actually work, and at times they even work well, but overall the clunky and phony feeling to the film leaves the audience rather detached and uninterested.  We can address the big pink elephant in the room right on and just say that this film is as `true' as `The Blair Witch Project' was, and so all the constant claims to authenticity are obnoxious and irritating.  I didn't need Wikipedia to tell me that this film was a phony (although it did tell me).  The supposed `actual footage' is so forced looking and the actual supposed alien possession scenes are completely CGI'd (especially the last one).  The film tries very hard to convince you that this is all real, but as the actors say on the outset, what you believe is up to you and there is no way I believe a word of this film.  So, with all the `this is real, be very afraid' hoopla, it became apparent that the writers didn't think hard enough about constructing a coherent plot.  The film just kind of meanders and wobbles on its unsteady legs.  Some scenes contain truly terrifying moments, but they are masked over by overworked segments of force-fed foolery.

I love you Milla Jovovich, but you really need to get your act together.

I think that `The Fourth Kind' is a case of `too much'.  It just throws way too much at you.  It tries to convince you that the footage it presents is `real', but the overall flow of the film is far too clean to produce any genuine terror.  There needed to be grittiness, even to the supposed reenactment scenes, and yet the film is polished and crisp in texture, which takes you out of the `realness' it is trying to present.  A lot of the scenes feel overproduced and underdeveloped, especially when the screen is split in fours and your struggling to watch every angle of something that really only needed one angle to begin with.  Placing the `footage' side by side with the `reenactments' only shone a light on the scale of bad acting used in this film.

Nothing is convincing.

Alas, there was an hour and half (or so) of my time wasted.  I wanted to get scared.  I wanted to be terrified.  I wanted to lose sleep.

None of that happened.",1287360000,,2568,4.520607375271149
4044699,4,B0030DGHL0,"The movie is one that centers around some rather disturbing things that happened in Alaska. It leaves a lot open to the viewer, too, and sometimes that is good. Sometimes it is bad, too, and it also ruins a few of the moive's scenes. A lot of the movie is films in split screen or has real audio playing before or after it is acted out. Sometimes this kills the creativity that is being displayed and sometimes it shows you just how much goes into the interpration of actors. One scene out of everything stuck with me here, however, and it was one with a patient taking a family hostage. In one area you see the family and, in another, you see the people acting it out. Then you see both as the family and the father - the hostage taker - turn his gun on everyone and kill them all.
It was horrid and yet it said something on the reality of what was going on.

The one thing that everyone had in common was seeing an Owl that ""was not an owl,"" but that was thought to be a sign of abduction. There were quite a few oddities here, too, like the things on some of the tapes and some of the possibilities for languages. Still, some of it was not really scientific. The art of recalling memory,for example, is not really a scientific fact. If anything, it was fancy at the time and showing the tapes of it shows how many gaps are there. Sure, people want to believe and, sure, they make tapes that seem strange. The problem is that there is a level of expectation and, much like a parent seeing their child show off to them, this happens here as well.

I say this because I thought some of the showing hurt the movie. In the end you think what you want and you see that something possibly happened to these people. Is it a good thing - no. Is it a proven thing - no. The tapes brought in to suggest it was hurt the movie sometimes and, in some cases, make a case for something other than the suggestion of aliens.
It is creepy here and there, too, but I would have rather had my stars lghting up the sky and not a shellschocked doctor and her peers/patients/whomever making things slide progressively downhill.

That took this to about a 3.6, but rounding it to a 4 makes it seem right because some of it is captivating enough to see more than once.",1286236800,,2245,4.216279069767442

It was weird, half the movie is in split screen with cam-corder footage of the sposed ""real"" events. Redundant and annoying film style, the 10 million budget split between New Zealand and Buglaria is not likely to help this Director's Carreer, but the movie didn't bomb at the box office, so maybe they will let him do more. I hope he learned from his mistakes. Milla J. was great in the Fifth Element, but hasn't had a decent script since, appearently.

I will say that this movie was well researched, in terms of conspiracy lore. David Icke, Jordan Maxwell, and John Lamb Lash have their work at the center of all this, and the story sucked me in. I did my job as a movie watcher, to suspend my disbelief, but the constant insistance that I believe-believe was too much, although they did it with interesting surrealism. Was I supposed to smoke the ganja first?

This movie does quite a bit with owls and as a side-note, Israelis and Palestinians share more than just a land claim. They are noted for their owl phobia, so this movie will play well in the middle east should it be screened there, but it didn't work with me, and I was never more proud to be a rational gentile. Owls? Seriously? Why not poodles? I feel sorry for anyone who has a phobia problem, especially with cute animals.

Apart from this being work of fiction playing at being a real documentary, nothing about this movie is believable except the depiction of God.

Basically the film has a pretty good atmosphere, but it never truly scares me like the writers intended.  I can tell they set out to make the ultimate horror film but it never quite reaches that level of uncontrollable fear.

That whole translation stuff was bogus. 2) The tapes?

Dilmun was actually more advanced than Sumeria and the Akkadians were the real brains behind Sumeria. Most people don't realize those facts, all they know is Sumeria from the 12th Planet nonsense. Apparently they didn't consult a real expert in Sumerian before they made the movie.

The gimmick here -- and it's well done -- is that they show supposed actual footage of events and testimony that were alleged to have taken place, alongside the glossy Hollywood reenactment of the same.

So, for example, you have the luscious Milla Jovovich playing the psychologist in Nome, Alaska who wonders why a number of her patients are having trouble sleeping and are all reporting similar events depriving them of sleep.  Meanwhile we see grainy footage of a college professor interviewing the ""real"" psychologist, a middle-aged woman who seems to be suffering from acute post-traumatic stress disorder.

4044711,4,B0030DGHL0,"Director Olatunde Osunsanmi drops the ball occasionally with this film, there's no denying that--having Milla Jovovich (Dr. Abbey Tyler) approach the camera at the beginning, looking every inch a Hollywood actress, telling us that ""what we are about to see are interviews with abductees"" and the rest of it.  He did not handle the premise nearly as well as the makers of ""Paranormal Activity"", ""The Blair Witch"", etc, and I suspect that otherwise this would be in the top ranks of a lot of the horror films made today.

If one can overlook that mole, this is a startling and at times really scary film which approaches ""alien abduction"" from a different vantage point: if an alien entity did indeed exist it would not necessarily be a benevolent force in the universe.  Indeed, it may be the exact opposite: a malign and vicious phenomena which destroys the human psyche at random and reduces human beings to mere husks of what they were.  It provides some real chills to see (Charlotte Milchard)  the 'Real' Dr. Abbey Tyler  being interviewed about her experiences, looking like a half alien and half annorexic who has had the life quite literally scared out of her.

The film's basic premise is the destruction of a small town, and Jovovich plays a shrink who is unfortunate enough to have most of her patients end up getting into contact with some kind of alien intelligence.  ""The White Owl"" is a Lovecraftian image used regularly throughout the movie--all the abductees report witnessing an appalling, disgusting image of a white owl outside their windows.  One commits suicide and takes his family with him, leading the town sherrif (Will Patton hamming it up again) to believe that Tyler is somehow responsible for these events.  The mood of psychological disturbance is amped up to the max when she begins to videotape these interviews and the patients are sometimes literally ""torn apart"" by their psychic distress.  The ""archival footage"" is what makes this film.  I don't think there's much ambiguity here: Tyler was not crazy and whether her husband really did commit suicide or not, he was in all likelihood a victim of the same presence.  This movie is thoroughly frightening, and not to be taken lightly because of the slightly goofy way the filmmaker decided to handle the ""real interview"" concept.",1281744000,6,2314,4.917737789203085
4044712,1,B0030DGHL0,"Help! The owls are coming! The owls are coming! If you are a brain dead moron, then you'll be interested in this movie. Imagine if you will, aliens traveling hundreds of millions of miles across space only to sit on tree branches and scare people.

Occasionally one of them stops hooting and decides to go inside the house and give the occupants a really goooooood scare. Of course nobody ever remembers anything and they have to be hypnotized into remembering the scary experience which invariably results in screaming, breaking of furniture, and the one I really love is when some dude levitated right off the bed.

The video of the man levitating in the air would have been on CNN if it ever happened which it didn't.

This is another one I love. The protagonist explains that the aliens sort of beamed her daughter up through the ceiling of the house and through the roof and took her away.

If aliens had that kind of technology, then why would they sitting outside peoples houses pretending they were owls? And if they could just beam people up (Scotty), why would they waste time walking around scaring people. Are the sadists? Why wouldn't they just pick some dude out in the country, beam him up quickly and quietly, do their thing, put him back and go. What's with the scaring? (Sells more tickets to stupid people)

And finally, because I don't want to wast anymore time on this, in the beginning of the movie the girl says her husband was murdered by someone stabbing him to death, and that she witnessed it. At the end the sheriff says, in the supposedly surprise ending, that he killed himself with a gun. Gee, I guess she really tricked the coroners office, all the police, the doctor who had to give the certificate of death, and everyone else who was surrounded with the death that he had been stabbed. You would think that detail might be important enough for the sheriff to mention to her at the inquest. I guess she had the ""Force"" at the beginning of the movie and used it to make everyone believe her husband was stabbed to death by a stranger when he actually shot  himself. Where was Colombo when he was needed?

To sum this one up, it's one boring piece of coprolite. If you liked The Grudge, Blair Witch, and other assorted movies for the dumbed down generation, then you will probably love this.

This was a very well developed film that really makes you think. It's a movie mixed in with a semi documentary about the experience of Alien abductions and skepticism. The movie really doesn't take any sides it only presents you with evidence.

 This isn't ""Signs"" so don't expect to go into watching this expecting to see some sort of creature at the end. The film really plays on your mind and leaves you wondering just what is happening to these people. You don't have to be into alien phenomenon to enjoy this. It adds much suspense to the story to make it frightening enough.

The big catch of the movie is that the director mixed in real footage and audio from the original accounts. I honestly don't think it's the real footage or audio but instead a remake of the occurrences put into the film and then placed as original and then the film remakes the remake (confusing enough?)but I doubt it was anything at all like what they portrayed in the film. I expect it to be highly exaggerated.

The Fourth Kind isn't a film for everyone. If your the type that needs to see action sequences this isn't the film for you. This is the type of movie designed to play on your mind.

The movie do not have much blood and gore, but it uses sounds, lighting and camera work very effectively. The story is interesting and the acting is quite good.

However there is a catch, the movie makers claim the movie to be real, most if not all of those claims have been refuted. The pepole in this film are characters, not real pepole. Unfortunately such scams hurt the credibility of real UFO phenomena. This movie tries to take a Blair Witch, claiming it had real footage, it do not, the woman in the interview is an actress, the story of this movie is pure fiction. The phenomena of alien abduction however is not, and the claims this movie makes just hurt the credibility of those who tell real stories.

All in all however this is a well crafted, creepy horror movie. If you like movies like the Blair Witch and the like you will love this one. I would have given it four stars, but I dislike the movie makers lying and claiming the movie to be based on a real story, when it clearly is not. There might be hints of truth here and there, but the whole story with the doctor and her patients, that is all made up.",1278633600,,1713,4.400630914826499

I see the line between ""real"" and ""fake"" is getting blurrier and blurrier for films these days, to the point they're faking footage for the purpose of storytelling. I would have enjoyed it more if it were just admittedly fiction.

4044718,1,B0030DGHL0,"The footage in this movie is NOT real.  This is NOT based on true events. This story DID NOT happen.  The reason this has to be stressed, is because of how the movie is presented.  It's presented as entirely a work of reality based events.  Even the actors talk about how real it is in the movie.  When I first watched this movie, I was under the understandable impression that this movie was based on true events.

This movie actually makes me quite angry, and here's why... I believe in aliens, I've seen UFOs with my own eyes.  With time, people have become more open about their own encounters with E.T.'s.  I believe the governments around the world know many things about UFOs and aliens, and refuse to share it with the public on a mass scale because of widespread panic & worry.  This is a TERRIBLE movie for exactly that reason - people who see it believe it's real, and therefore have cause to be scared of aliens.  This gives governments and agencies MORE reason to keep us away from the topic of openly discussing UFOs and aliens with them.  Because thanks to this piece of **** movie, the public is more likely to be afraid.

In our quest to make contact with aliens on a mass scale & talk about it openly & freely without so much fear of aliens & what making contact with them could bring - this movie has set the human race back many years.  This movie is a step back for mankind.  This isn't like the movie Independence Day.  That movie didn't inspire fear in people about aliens because we knew it was fake.  It didn't try to fool people into thinking it was real.  The Fourth Kind should never be viewed by anyone.  Knowing the story is fake even takes all the entertainment out of the movie, really... In fact the movie actually being fake just makes it downright stupid & a waste of time. The whole movie runs it's entertainment value on being based on true events, once this is taken away, it's really just a horrible movie.

Why would aliens even try to make contact with us on a mass scale if they know movies like this exist, & many unknowing people are scared of aliens because of it?

4044720,4,B0030DGHL0,"The film managed to present credible degree of plausibility on its story. It does not exaggerate it with special effects. While it's shown a fictional movie, the introduction by the lead actress Milla Jovovich on the character she's playing added realism to the show.

In fact, the show tried to use extensive footage from the lead character Dr. Abigail Tyler that were featured from her hypnosis sessions and afew on situations surrounding her that were gotten from the police. The flim's presentation and somber tone gave it a good mix that it's trying to be as realistic and as close to a semi-documentary as possible.

A lot of critics dissent whether the events that happen are real. Given the length the director went through to super-impose the raw images and Milla Jovovich reassurance from the start of the flim that it was real, I am not sure how much they are expecting, short of having a personal intimate experience on the subject.

On the other hand, the director can never claim for it to be documentary given the ""lack of facts"" related to such a theme (of the fourth kind). Afterall, its not an animal documentary. Thus far, I also haven't read any law-enforcement officers disputing the contents and trips made by the FBI to Nome. To me, that's as real as it gets.
The only distraction I have, is probably why does the real Abigail Tyler looked so ghostly. It was not known that for a person with her exposure would looked ghostly.

On the whole, I would give the film a 4 stars for the realism it portrays and the attention it managed to sustain on the viewers throughout the film.",1276992000,2,1600,4.6431095406360425

That is because the events in this film supposedly all happened in Nome, Alaska.  As anybody who has seen ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind/dp/B000VECAD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>"" might guess from the title, this 2009 film has something to do with aliens; UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek's original three classifications have been expanded by others to seven, of which the fourth is alien abduction.  It seems that while there are video recordings of many of Dr. Tyler's, instead of making a documentary, writer-director Olatunde Osunsanmi, has combined the ""real"" footage with the recreations by Jovovich and the other actors.  Throughout the film we not only switch back and forth between the ""real"" and the ""dramatizations,"" but often we will see both on screen at the same time.  Additionally, there is a lot of reading to do in this film, because a lot of what is being ""said"" is unintelligible otherwise and there are also these annoying reminders that Will Patton is an actor.

Every since I started reading the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Princess-of-Mars/dp/1587156164/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Princess of Mars</a>,"" which often begin with a declaration that there story is true or the author found the manuscript, I have been aware that just because something says it is true, it is not necessarily true.  That applies to not only things like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amityville-Horror/dp/B0008191WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amityville Horror</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/B00009W5CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>,"" but also you standard biopics or any depictions of historical (a.k.a. ""real"") events.  I do not believe politicians or people selling products on television, but I am going to treat anything I see in a movie as ""what really happened""?  Not going to happen.  But every since ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>,"" which successfully suckered a heck of a lot of people (including my oldest daughter) into believing it was real after seeing the ""documentary"" on television, filmmakers have been trying to make lightning strike twice.  The closest a film has come to succeeding in that regard has been ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B002VKE1K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>,"" and that is not because I ever entertained any belief that the story was true, but rather because it had the same sort of simplicity that made ""Blair Witch"" work.  In contrast to either of those films, ""The Fourth Kind"" is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to keeping things simple.

The fault for this film's failure lies more in the motive for the elaborate insistence that this is a ""true"" story, which Osunsanmi felt was necessary to construct because basically a lot of his key scenes are patients, under hypnosis, talking to a psychiatrist.  This is not a situation that makes for thrilling filmmaking, and usually involves flashbacks (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suddenly-Last-Summer/dp/B00004TWZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suddenly, Last Summer</a>"") or the recreation of dream imagery (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spellbound/dp/B001D8W7F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spellbound</a>,"" where Hitchcock used Salvadore Dali to come up with the imagery).  I think that is the reason for complicating things with the wall of competing images.  So it is not surprising that the parts of the movie that I thought were most effective were far removed from that nonsense, namely when Sheriff August (Patton) interrogates Abby about what the hell has been happening and confronts her with some pretty brutal realities.  I have always liked Patton's quiet intensity and Jovovich's scenes with him are the best I have seen her do in a movie, which is while I end up rounding up on this movie.

It's one thing to present documentary style footage and lead the audience to buy into what they're seeing (Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc), it's another thing entirely to make a statement that it's real when it's not.

My grown daughter,my only child to whom I share many things, told me about the movie,""The Fourth Kind"".  We decided I would not watch it alone.  it just seemed to scary.

I was living in a very small town so we all agreed to not say a word.

What did catch my attention is the use of the sumariun languege. It is a fact that they do have pictures of what could be construde as alien people and some sort of air craft. They are considered the first civilisation. In order to be deemed one there are few things that have to be present, religion a form of government and a written languege.they had that plus they grew crops with a crued but effective irrigation system bult bildings where as before humans were mobile and the giant leape in a short time from being very primative, it should have taken loads of time to reach there level,in fact some scollars think the alien possabilty plausable while others think that angels came down and taught them these things,it's not unreasanble that who ever were speaking threw these people might be true.

4044727,5,B0030DGHL0,"Nome, Alaska, October 2000: Dr. Abigail Tyler (Milla Jovovich) is a psychologist ministering to the citizens of Nome, a secluded Alaskan town which is only accessible by air. Still mourning the recent death of her husband, Tyler spends her days dealing with an apparent epidemic of insomnia amongst the town's citizens - but as Tyler delves deeper into the nature of her patient's sleep-related maladies, she begins to notice a disturbing number of similarities and correlations between their stories. Why are they all waking at 3:33am? And why are they all seeing owls outside their windows? As time draws on, she enlists the aid of colleague Dr. Abel Compos (Elias Koteas) and slowly begins piecing together fragments of information which suggest a nightmarish truth.

I'll admit it, ""The Fourth Kind"" caught me completely off guard; I rented it expecting a mildly entertaining mid-budget thriller fashioned after the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-The-Complete-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000UZDO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files: The Complete Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steven-Spielberg-Presents-Taken/dp/B00005JM39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steven Spielberg Presents Taken</a>&nbsp;and instead experienced one of the most profoundly scary films that I've seen in a long time. This is no small praise when you consider that I've read a fair number of books and seen a fair number of films and TV shows about UFOs, aliens and abduction phenomena and am completely skeptical about the whole thing (the hard cold figures of Drake's equation negates the possibility of alien contact as far as I'm concerned).

While it's true that this film works through every Whitley Strieberesque clich in the abduction playbook (screen memories, subliminally buried recollections accessible only through hypnosis, white lights and, hell, even some allusions to the work of Erich Von Daniken), director Olatunde Osunsami innovatively uses a gamut of structural, editing, split-screen and soundtrack techniques in order to draw the viewer into a tapestry of ""dramatically reconstructed events"" which appear alongside ""archival footage"" on which the reconstruction is allegedly based; the net effect of this tinkering with 'levels of reality' is a palpably eerie sense of authenticity which pervades the film and only serves to reinforce the chills that materialise. Situations and clichs that you've seen a million times before in a million different movies and TV shows are suddenly thrown into stark relief and become deeply frightening again.

Originally, I was only intending to give this film four stars, but it really did get into my head (and impress me with it's innovative structuring) and, frankly, it takes a lot to unnerve and impress me these days, so it gets a round five stars. Seriously, this a film which is both vastly scarier than (and vastly superior too) the massively over-hyped and deeply pedestrian&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B002VKE1K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>&nbsp;as well as virtually every other horror film in recent years.

...And if you consider yourself a jaded old cynic and think that this film can't get into your head, I issue you the following challenge - watch this alone, late at night, with the lights out and the sound way up...and then discover what an interesting prospect going to sleep on your own in the dark becomes.",1274227200,90,3596,6.031311154598826
4044728,3,B0030DGHL0,"Every movie asks you to suspend some disbelief.  Even if you are watching a space vampire movie, you let go and fall into that zone where you sort of live the movie as if it were real.  This movie blends supposedly ""real"" video from real cases with reenactments to construct the entire story.  If you can let go and go with that, the movie is scarey and worth watching.  The ""documentary"" roughness of having the ""real"" video with the ""reenactment"" both on the screen at the same time can add to the suggestion that this whole thing is real.

SPOILER ALERT---Do not read on if you have not seen this yet.
I thought the end was a little off with the final summerian message and its implications.  I think it would have been more scarey if the little one had not been taken and never returned.  Also, what happened to the deputy who saw what we saw on the car camera beforre it fritzed out; he kind of gets dropped out.  The sheriff overacts and comes across as hostile without any real motivation to be do, unless at the end we are supposed to think that the husband had no stab wounds but nonetheless she insisted all along he was stabbed and they just let her ""free"" to practice.

It combines an intriguing and eerie topic (alien abduction) with elements floating somewhere between the mockumentary/found footage genre and documentary dramatization...while properly managing itself as a film 'based on true events'.  I really enjoyed the effort put into creating this atmosphere of 'reality' with the use of the split screen and juxtaposition of so-called 'real' and dramatization, sometimes segmenting the screen into four quadrants for maximum intake (the extremely intense moment with Tommy and his family comes to mind).  Another intriguing use of experimentation can be found in all the distorted footage whenever encounters with these entities occurred.  I thought this really challenged the viewer to look deeper into the imagery, depend more on the audible cues and subtitling, and really dig deeper into the genre.  No extravagant 3-D modeling, no sappy storyline, just interesting storytelling (in both senses of the word) and intense emotion that drove the narrative to its ultimate conclusion of loss, reflection and mystery.  I even enjoyed the audio clips throughout the end credits (when you see it, you'll understand their correlation)!  Like other alien encounter movies - Close Encounters, Communion, Fire in the Sky, and in some respect, the latter portions of Twin Peaks (""the owls are not what they seem"") - this is sure to please your sense of suspense!

4044731,2,B0030DGHL0,"Why? Because it's fake. I see a lot of debate here whether this is true or not: it isn't. This is a fake-umentary like the Blair Witch Project, except that in this one the director goes out of his way to hide that fact by letting the viewer ""choose"" whether what they see it's true or not. More on that later.

A brief synopsis: in the town of Nome, Alaska several people are reporting similar disturbing experiences, which a psychologist begins to investigate and put together. His wife picks up the trail of the research after he is killed in their bedroom while they sleep. The movie begins with her, Dr. Abigail Tyler, under hypnosis so she could remember who killed him. The story that follows involve her own (taped) meetings with clients, a murder-suicide, the disappearance of her own daughter (which ""remains unsolved"") and how they all relate to UFO abductions.

The movie itself works beautifully; it is creepy, scary, disturbing and combines acted with ""real"" footage. The problem is that the ""real"" footage is not real. Sometimes it is not even well acted: while the sympathetic part of me initially respected these distraught people's suffering, the skeptic and trained actor in me finally recognized the at times obvious acting and snake-oil delivery. It was halfway through the movie when I realized the Fourth Kind wanted to pull the proverbial wool over my eyes.

A) When people levitate, there is the always convenient blanket or cloth covering the obvious device below that ""levitates"" them.
B) The footage, would you believe it, always goes fuzzy at the hypnotism sessions because of the ""energy"" released by the patients. We don't get to see the incredible things that happen at those moments. Darn it!
C) The police car footage is always too perfectly located to catch all events.

As I watched the decrepit and heartbroken Dr. Tyler, I kept thinking ""she is acting - it's obvious"". True enough, she is NOT the actual doctor (if the doctor even exists). Her name is Charlotte Milchard (google her) and she is a British actress whose IMDB page does not -at the time of this writing- even lists her casting for this movie, although one look at her headshots will suffice to prove she is an actress, not the fabled Dr. Tyler. And this is my problem with the movie: stop claiming something is based on a true story (or in this instance ""actual case studies"") when it isn't. It's like walking into a barn, seeing a pig in a corner with a spider nearby and claiming Charlotte's Web is based on a ""true"" story!

Have some people in Nome, Alaska disappeared without a trace? Unfortunately, it seems like they have. Has the FBI investigated these claims? I'm sure they have, as they do with rashes of unsolved mysteries by local authorities. Does that mean aliens abducted them? Hardly.

This film is disturbing, creepy enough and not badly made; a perfect movie if you are in the mood with friends. Yet, like Orson Welles' original radio airing of War of the Worlds, it's meant to prey on people's ignorance - except the Fourth Kind has no disclaimers whereas even Welles' worst fiasco did - at the end I found myself disliking the movie more than if it had been honest about itself at the outset. It would have been better if it didn't go out of its way to hide the facts.

4044735,5,B0030DGHL0,"The Fourth Kind documents the encounters of Dr. Abigail Tyler of Nome Alaska and her patients.  One of the things that immediately struck me in the film was the recurring imagery of a Barn Owl  by Dr. Tyler and her patients.

Those who do not understand why owls are ideally suited to a surveillance role, overlook this or use it as a point of mockery for their disbelieving and insensitive posts.  This is really a shame because, because assuming one has the power to control animals, an Owl would be your number one choice for nighttime human habitat surveillance.

Like eagles, owls are raptors, descendants of predatory dinosaurs. What is interesting about owls is how nature has coordinated their hearing and vision.  As to their sense of smell, it is rather poor. It is why the Great Horned Owl (which is also a native species in Alaska) is the number one predator of skunks.  The Barn Owl in this film is so effective in controlling rodent populations that many farmers prefer them to poisons and traps.

The eyes of an owl are powerful.  So powerful, were humans to have similar capabilities, our eyes would be the size of small oranges.  The feathered cups around the owls eyes are there for a purpose many do not understand.  If we compare them to the satellite dishes we use for cable TV, the owl's early capture line of sight sounds and then direct those sounds to its ears.

An owl's ears are asymmetrical. In other words, one is always a little higher than the other. The reason for this, is that it enables the owl to compare differences between the two ears so as to determine the distance to the target. In a manner of speaking this is much like how submarines use sonar, to determine direction and distance to target.

Consequently, when an owl is looking in a specific direction, they see with incredible acuity the line of sight sounds from the target are calculated thanks to the owl's asymmetrical ears. Consequently, the owl see and hears the target with perfect clarity and likewise knows the precise distance and movement of the target as well.

Assuming, you are and extraterrestrial and you want to know where your targets are in a human habitat, you send an owl.  Once the owl hear detects a sound from inside the structure it focuses its eyes in the direction.  At that point, you'll know exactly who or what is in that structure, as well as their precise location.  You'll likewise know if they are moving or resting.  Or in other words, an owl is the perfect surveillance tool for an abduction.

I believe that this woman and her patients had genuine and terribly unfortunate experiences.  Emotional pain like that goes beyond the antics of theater.  However, what is most unfortunate, is the arrogant mockery these experiencers must endure from those who simply will not open their minds, but rather, humiliate others to protect their own fears.",1272499200,2,2877,4.714
4044736,3,B0030DGHL0,"Ok. It wasn't a true story (or was it,,,,,?) and the disclaimer, and ""real"" Dr. Tyler are part of the hoax. It's still a scary movie. There were a few moments I was genuinely disturbed by it.

In some Sumerian myths, as well as the myths of other ancient cultures, they speak of powerful disembodied beings that humans are naturally repelled by. I wonder if the producers / writers of this film were aware of this, and gave it a sci-fi / extraterrestrial setting. Or perhaps those repulsive beings our ancient ancestors spoke about were extraterrestrials. Who knows?",1272412800,3,566,4.775510204081633
4044737,3,B0030DGHL0,"I think every director now wants his own horror or sci fi franchise in order to make millions.  I doubt if this is going to be one of those launching pads.  Chiefly, it is too derivative.  The big thing now is to make it look as if you are watching a hybrid of reality tv and an actual movie and get suitably horrified as the ""realness"" of it gets to you.  So what we are supposed to leave this film thinking is that not only have we made contact with aliens (the first kind) but now we are well along to the 4th Kind where they actually abduct us.  Someone somewhere may make a convincing argument about that happening but it is not this movie which achieves this feat.  Nonetheless, it was watchable. I was working on an art project and just kept this running throughout.  The first couple screams jarred me but I can't say I was ever really scared.  Is this like the Gold Standard for this type of thing (SIXTH SENSE)?  No way. It is watchable on your tv set and that is about it.  Have something handy to do while you watch it.

4044738,4,B0030DGHL0,"This is one of the creepiest films I've seen in some time. As others have noted, it follows the convention that the producers have filmed a documentary & are fictionalizing it. At the beginning, lead actress Milla Jovovich walks out of a fog with an ""explanation"" of what is to come. Several times the film employs a split-screen device to show equivalent sequences from the supposed documentary. The effect is unnerving.

Background: Nome, Alaska has experienced a number of cases of persons gone missing (this appears to be true). Dr. Abigail Tyler (played by Jovovich), a psychologist getting over what she maintains was the murder of her husband, has devoted herself to continuing the project he was working on related to these disappearances. Through a number of interviews and hypnotic regression sequences she stumbles on the truth: aliens are abducting people from Nome; some are returned, some not. The visible manifestation of the aliens is a white owl outside one's bedroom window that stares in at you, unmoving, unafraid of you, sometimes remaining in one place for hours.

Dr. Tyler's hypnotic regressions get out of control as her subjects relive their harrowing experiences, sometimes severely injured as *something* seems to possess them. One of her subjects murders his family and then kills himself to escape the horror. Sheriff August (Will Patton) doesn't believe her talk of aliens and thinks something she is doing is causing these breakdowns and injuries. He believes she's delusional, having gone over the edge following what happened to her husband (turns out he wasn't murdered but committed suicide in front of her). But the aliens have turned their attention to Dr. Tyler herself. They ""take"" her daughter Ashley, already traumatized from losing her father...

A number of others writers have panned this movie. I thought its main devices worked remarkably well; I found myself wanting to hit the pause button and go into my office to ""google"" Abigail Tyler to find out if this was a real documentary. One of the purposes of sci-fi / horror is to get you, the viewer, to suspend your disbelief at least for the duration. This film does that. It is effective enough to have generated online discussions explaining how it worked, and that the ""documentary"" is part of an elaborate fictional device, and that the ""real"" Dr. Tyler was a different actress named Charlotte Milchard.

Overall, I found The Fourth Kind to be inferior to Fire in the Sky which has the weirdest and most disturbing sequence I ever saw in a UFO movie. There are a few faux pas IMHO. The film's events are set in October 2000, it says; yet the Nome of this film is awfully lush for that late in the year. Nome, Alaska has a hostile, Arctic climate; and I've never had the impression the surrounding area is as mountainous as it is portrayed here. (I've not been there; others can inform me if this is wrong; I won't mind.) Moreover, apparently the creators of the film went a bit overboard using made-up obits and invented news items that prompted legal action from the Alaska Press Club.

Be all this as it may, the film raises some interesting questions. What *did* happen to those people who vanished (ten just since 1990, according to Wikipedia)? While there is nothing to suggest the involvement of aliens, if they simply wandered off drunk and froze to death in the below-zero weather, their bodies would have been found eventually. As for UFOs and abductions: thousands of reliable witnesses have seen things in the sky no one can explain including trained observers: airline pilots, police officers, even astronauts. There are a handful of well documented cases of ""missing time,"" as the literature calls gaps in people's memories ranging from hours to days. The above-mentioned Fire in the Sky dramatizes one such case. What happened? A Christian friend of mine says that UFOs and alien manifestations are the work of demonic forces, not alien intelligences. Whatever they may be, apparently they have been around for quite a while. Members of our culture with its fascination with technology and space travel see spaceships and aliens. Back in the 1800s it was airships. Centuries ago, people saw burning chariots in the sky. You can find them in the Old Testament (see Jeremiah 1). I didn't yet mention: the Fourth Kind beings, whatever they are supposed to be, spoke Sumerian and surely sounded demonic. The voices supposedly recorded by Dr. Tyler on tape make this not a film to watch before you go to bed at night! At least not before checking outside your bedroom window for unmoving white owls with large, staring eyes!

4044744,1,B0030DGHL0,"This movie is a fraud.

I did some investigating and uncovered the truth behind the story.  Dr. Abigail Tyler doesn't exist-- the woman claiming to be her in the movie is an actress.  The ""actual footage"" is staged (though admittedly it is the most engaging part of the movie).  The truth is that the ""actual events"" that inspired this movie are nothing special.  The filmmakers took the concept of ""Lots of people disappear in Nome, Alaska) and wrapped their own story around it.  It's no different than if I went into my refrigerator and my last soda was missing.  I could make a movie about it where an octopus crawled out of my sink and stole it and claim it was based on ""actual events"" (those being that my soda is missing) even though the truth is really that my idiot roommate took it.

This movie exists in the weirdest cinematic purgatory that I've ever seen.  It's a strange brew of this-is-real-no-wait-it's-a-movie, all of which is prefaced by a weird mini-monologue by Milla Jovovich that sets the stage for this clunky deception.

Had this movie been another mockumentary composed of just the ""actual"" footage a la the Blair Witch Project or Paranormal activity (or maybe structured more like ""The Last Broadcast"") it could have been a solid piece of entertainment.  Instead it's a colossal failure that will do nothing but set legitimate UFOlogists back even further.",1271376000,14,1383,4.817796610169491

The movie is suspenseful, but the 'create a lot of chaotic noise and visuals while showing nothing' approach has been done to death, and I confess I was very disappointed.

Given that this movie was not a genuine re-enactment of actual events, it just seems a pointless addition to the vast number of similar alien/abduction orientated movies that have been coming out for eons. At least the movie Fire In The Sky was based on a real case, and told it well.

Maybe it's the movie's premise; that intellectually-advanced aliens travel trillions of miles to reach Nome, AL, avoiding all detection and contact, just to abduct children and tell us they're God in our sleep.  My personal favorite is the ""doctor"" who translates ancient Sumerian (a language dead for 5000 years that no one has, or ever will, hear spoken) the very first time he hears it on a garbled, $5 tape recorder spoken by an Alien - but somehow misses all the key action verbs and conjunctions.

The 4th kind is a movie that scared me senseless. If you don't like aliens, or think the idea of abduction is stupid, then it won't scare you. But what makes this movie awesome is the mood it sets.

Take one of the few monsters many people believe are real, show them torturing (apparently in real footage) innocent, defenseless people and you have one scary movie. Once you read that while some of the audio is real (Which Parts, How much?) the video is not, you aren't so scared. The inhumanly open mouths and arched backs aren't real, so what's left? Well, how about motive? What possible motivations might these ""aliens"" have? Unfortunately, the movie doesn't even ask this question.

Without the scary footage and your belief that it is real, this movie just doesn't make sense. What possible reason would aliens have for torturing people while lecturing to them in Ancient Sumerian? Can we believe that such a highly advanced civilization lacks the ability to speak English? Why can't they come up with something more believable to say to a woman with a PHD than ""I am God your savior""? If this really happened, the answers to these questions seem more pressing than the portrayal of suffering humans.

""The Fourth Kind"" does not seem to be about any alien abduction I've ever heard of. What it does remind me of was a rogue chapter in an otherwise good book on UFO's  by Phillip Imbrogno's, called ""Interdimensional Universe: The New Science of UFOs, Paranormal Phenomena and Other dimensional Beings"". With the exception of that one chapter his compilation of abduction case histories was quite believable. The chapter in question referred to ""demon"" aliens who spoke backwards, (a scare technique first used in the movie ""The Exorcist"") and looked like giant Lizards. During that investigation of a woman and her daughter (also living in a rural area) who were being threatened by these creatures, men in black appeared and several of Imbrogno's fellow researchers died. It made me ask who would want to use these techniques, against whom, and why? Like the ""demon alien"" chapter, the movie makes no attempt to explain ""why"" or indulge in any real plot resolution beyond the idea that they are ""evil"". But don't evil people have motives too?

I would say that whatever is happening in Alaska has the same origin as what happened in Imbrogno's case. What it smacks of is not aliens, but some sort of high tech military operation to which they have yet to recruit a good screen writer. Aren't these the same people who once subjected soldiers to radiation to see what would happen and gave equally unsuspecting recruits LSD?

My guess is that whoever is behind the abuses taking place in Alaska has graduated from speaking backwards to speaking ancient Sumerian. They are better at torture than plot lines and seem content with the fact that their visits cause people to commit suicide and murder thier kin out of fear. You get your enemy to kill himself without any apparent human interaction! Who would benefit from using that? Real aliens would have no trouble killing us if they wanted to, they could scare us to death just by stepping out of a space craft and giving us a dirty look. So why all the dramatics?? If there is an objective here it fits the military better than it does any alien society. Incidentally, Sumerian was a language once spoken in the Middle East.

While this movie did not offer any solutions to the problems it presents, it did leave me thinking. If our government can let Wall Street create grossly unfair lending instruments that force millions of American's out of their homes (and is probably responsible for more than a few suicides), why wouldn't they let the military drive a few people out of their minds for a ""good cause"" like national security?

4044766,4,B0030DGHL0,"I will not go into plot/ storyline, you can read the other reviews with the plot layed out.

This is just my own opinion/ thoughts and review of the film.

What do I believe? The ending left more questions than answers in my opinion. I believe this movie was a very clever rouse by the filmmakers, in the vain of  Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, Exorcism of Emily Rose, Fire in the Sky, The Mothman Prophecies making something that is said to be based on true events be not true at all or taking slightly the most sliver of truths and building a fictitious story around it, seen it done hundreds of times in books and movies. We do get Milla Jovovich in the beginning of the film stating that what we are about to see are reenactments of events mixed with ""real"" archival footage of interviews/ hypnosis sessions/  of real people all experiencing some kind of UFO phenomena happening around Nome Alaska in Fall of 2000. Milla Jovovich portrays the Dr in the reenactments then through out we get interview snip- its of the real Dr. Tyler. A part of me wanted to believe this was real, but I would think if a noted Dr of Abigail Tyler's profession would have made this case go nationwide, and that Discovery or History Channel or Larry King would have aired some kind of special about UFO abductions and in particular about strange occurrences in and around Nome Alaska. And this definitely could have been an X Files episode, makes me wonder if the director's inspiration came from the X Files. And The supposedly real interviews and hypnosis sessions through out the movie do seem real and genuinely frightening/ disturbing.... and I don't want to forget the owls...  never have owls seemed so other worldly spooky, and ghost like, some scenes the eyes seem to be piercing into your soul when it looks at you, in the movie there is a correlation with the owls and the conjectured other worldly Visitors, and the ""real"" Dr. Abigail Tyler looks ghostly, sickly, kinda creepy when she first shows up on the screen, we see her being interviewed by the director of this film to give it that realness. Some notable supporting roles: Will Patton, always a favorite of mine turns in a nice performance of the sheriff who doesn't believe in all this UFO mumbo jumbo crap, Elias Koteas as another Dr. friend of Dr. Tyler, gives a good steady performance as well, and Milla of course is great,a different role for her, more dramatic role, shows she's branching off.

I give credit to the over all tone of the movie and mood, and style, way it was filmed, mixing supposedly real footage and the reenactments with the actors, very good plot device. I just have to wonder how would said filmmakers get to clear all the red tape if in fact they were real footage of everything that Dr. Tyler did? But kudos to the filmmaker (Olatunde Osunsanmi)for giving us a genuinely frightening, astounding psychological thriller been awhile since I've had my nerves jangled like that. What bothers me is not knowing if any of this stuff is true??? Guess what I believe in the end is what I decide....",1269216000,36,3075,4.622710622710622

The use Sumerian language and UFOs and most paranormal occurrences are often attended with a strong smell of sulfur. Will Patton is good in this film as well. It was at times scary and disturbing yet a bit tedious as well.

The fact that so many people do not think that the director's use of fictional archive footage isn't a dismal addition to the sci-fi canon and demeaning to the audience's intelligence, inspires me that I, too, can make money this way. As Mencken said, ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public"".",1269129600,2,582,4.705882352941177
4044770,1,B0030DGHL0,"""The Fourth Kind"" was written, directed, and acted in by Olatunde Osunsanmi. He plays the interviewer for the ""real"" Abigail Tyler. The movie opens with actress Milla Jovovich introducing herself and in a trippy spinning forest reveals that this movie will contain real archived footage of events that took place in Nome, Alaska alongside dramatizations of these events in which she will be playing the role of Abbey Tyler. We are informed that there have been a series of unexplained disappearances in Nome and she cautions us that some of the footage is very ""disturbing.""

Over the course of the film, we find out that the people of Nome have been having trouble sleeping and visions of an owl. When under hypnosis, they reveal there is no owl and there is something indescribably frightening at their door. After going through hypnosis, these people change as they react to their newfound memories and the public is in more danger than ever and psychologist, Dr. Tyler is being questioned by Sheriff August (alias) played by Will Patton.

""Paranormal Activity"" was an amazingly successful film made by Oren Peli on a budget of $11,000 and marketed as ""actual"" footage. What resulted was a vast public who believed (or were willing to believe for two hours) that paranormal events happened to these two people. But one quick trip to IMDB would prove that they are actors and we can judge the movie on its scare value alone. During the movie, I thought it was lame, afterwards though.....I didn't sleep well that night.

This movie decided to take the faux documentary/reality format a step further by creating an opening that feels like the old TV show, ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and presenting us with ""actual"" footage that might fool the untrained eye but only for a few minutes. One reason is Abigail Tyler's appearance in the interviews. She is wearing a great deal of pale powder makeup to appear even more sickly in bad lighting and is totally creepy. Real women do not powder their face to that degree and go without any eye makeup or lip color when they are being filmed on camera. You either make yourself look presentable or you don't try anything at all, you don't deliberately make yourself look worse. The saddest betrayal is taking this scary ghost woman who looks like she should be in ""The Ring"" or on ""Shutter Island"" and casting her counterpart as Milla Jovovich complete with a beautifully manicured appearance and fuchsia lipstick, you couldn't get more night and day than that.

There's a difference between reality and acting and I was mildly annoyed that the joke was taken this far but tried to be game about it and let myself be entertained for the course of the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the film wasn't that great either. The ""thrilling"" moments were very few and far between. Also the film really went overboard with facts and text on the screen and added audio and video that seemed cool at first but started to become a sad plea of ""Really! It's true! Look at all these important facts and references on the screen!"" Every time any type of alien encounter occurred on tape, it was too blurry, obscured and the tape suddenly messed up. Maybe that stuff would potentially happen in an actual situation, but this was so X-Files that I kept waiting for Mulder and Scully to show up. At least they have clever banter.

I really wasn't impressed with Jovovich in this film. She excels at action characters, looking hot and being bad-ass at the same time. Being a quiet psychologist was too big of a change and she just never fit this character right. She tried to plain down a bit with bulky sweaters but that lipstick was a dealbreaker. These may seem like small things but it's hard to play in this faux reality when the acting just isn't up to par enough from your lead and the big budget of this film actually takes away from the ""archived footage"" and becomes too distracting.

I don't recommend this film unless you are a really big sci-fi alien encounter buff and whether you believe or not, you'd probably have fun with this. If you're only mildly interested in UFO's, it probably won't hold your interest the same way it did to me.",1269129600,4,4169,4.71978021978022

I didn't go to see the film in the theater when it initially came out either in fear that it might not be that decent. Boy was I wrong! At least I grabbed it on Blu-Ray. The effect at home was probably even better than it would have at the movies. Those interview scenes when the video gets all distorted...YIKES!!! I can't stop thinking about it.

Do not let the effects and fillers hinder your ability to put a fictional or non-fictional label upon the content in this movie.  If you do research on the web, you will find nothing upon the backgrounds of this movie.

The Forth Kind presents a down to earth and acceptable cause to the myth of alien abductions.  The Forth Kind is a strong PG-13 film.  I would rate it R due to the nature and controversy upon the subject that the movie discusses.  I would not recommend this movie for children either.

The Forth Kind will scare the daylights out of you.  The story progression will keep you at the edge of your seat and you will beg for more at the conclusion.

Like so, there is no doubt that the film challenges our imagination with the premise of science VS fiction. I have performed multiple field investigations of such paranormal anomalies and found Parapsychological evidence to support such claims even thought there are many claims that are classified as hoax. Im also a Senior Paranormal Investigator with the Florida Paranormal Research Foundation and there are plenty of cases that exist that are beyond science and logical comprehension! Interestingly, Dr. Tyler never received sufficient assistance in her case and was dismiss by officials since this type of conspiracy theory can never be ascertained by officials, FBI or government.

Thus, can you Imagine the social pandemonium that would develop if the government was to confirm that Aliens are real! Subsequently, the Church will also lose its multibillion dollar a year franchises. In conclusion, the truth is out there....seek and thou shall find.

Yet the entire movie, you never see the UFO or aliens. Most alien abduction related films try and build suspense and climax until near the end of the movie, when you finally get to see
the aliens and or the UFO. Not this movie, you never see them at all.  The entire movie is people acting scared under hypnosis. Why didn't they just make a movie based on an actual case?
Whether you believe in Alien abduction or not, there is still a plethora of alien abduction cases in literature they could have used.
  The movie gets mired in plot devices that they insert but never fully build on, at all, such as the death of abigail tylers husband. They also go on a tangent about the aliens speaking sumerian and so forth, but they never give you any conclusion, there is no climax in this movie where everything feels resolved, AT ALL. They tried inserting too many plot devices
and never finished them.

And throughout history, as shown in the movie, there have been stories in folklore and also depicted in ancient art that seem to also describe alien abduction. Claiming to use real footage of a Nome, Alaska psychologist's interviews and hypnotic sessions, The Fourth Kind initially stirred as much interest as the similarly marketed Blair Witch Project. But after diligent research, and a lawsuit, its finally come out that the actual events the movie are based on are fiction. While Nome really has had an abnormally high number of deaths and disappearances, the FBI thinks that alcohol and the extreme climate are to blame. The surrounding villages are ""dry"" and unlike the wooded mountainous settings in the movie, Nome is surrounded by a flat landscape. But that doesn't mean its a bad movie, not at all.

The unknown can be terrifying and in this movie, being taken from your bed by alien entities is portraited in a very convincing manner. And while the underlying story is not true, the movie uses many details that actual abductees report. A putrid cinnamon smell, remembering an animal outside their window (in the movie its an owl), and strange wounds are all claimed to be experienced by real abductees and shown in the movie. Channeling aliens under hypnosis, as far as I know, is unique to the movie and used as a tool to help tell the story. If you are interested in man facing the unknown, scary movies, and of course, UFOs and alien abduction phenomena then you need to check out The Fourth Kind.

4044803,1,B0030DGHL0,"This was the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time. My friend drug me to it saying it was going to be terrifying, and I wound up rolling my eyes through the whole thing. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't claim it was real but from the opening scene it was VERY obvious it was completely fake so it was hard to like.

- Not scary what-so-ever
- Horrible acting
- Common story plot
- If you go into it thinking its real, its a major let-down.

But if you like alien movies, this is for you. Its entertaining if you have nothing else to do, but RENT it DON'T BUY it. Its a waste of money.",1268438400,4,595,3.909090909090909
4044804,1,B0030DGHL0,"where do i start about this terrible movie
first saying that a movie is a true story and based on real events
is really low and its really offensive to the people who actually lost a person
and putting an actress as the real abigail without even putting her name in the credits
is as low as it gets
the actress who supposed to be the real abigail has actually performed well
but the story is not convincing at all and there is a lot of goofs and mistakes in the movie
that its hard to mention all of them

i used to respect universal pictures and it was my favorite studio actually
because they gave us focus features with its awesome movies but after that
no more universal for me and i suggest people do the same
so the studio could learn to respect the feelings of the people who actually lost a person
and second the studio should respect the viewers and don't use made up stuff and say its real
its just unethical to say the least",1268438400,2,935,4.194444444444445
4044805,1,B0030DGHL0,"This is one of those movies that try to show you the least possible, making ALL and I mean ALL relevant scenes blurry and distorted, with the good ol' ""Interference blurred the recording"" trick. They try to have you, the spectator, create with your mind what they're suggesting is there but they're not really showing you anything. Many directors manage to pull this off successfully when they use it to build up tension in the movie and ultimately leading to a climax. But when this trick is used for the entire duration of the movie, it grows old REALLY quick.

You end up spending the whole movie waiting for them to show you the big thing and they basically never show you anything. The clearest thing you might be able to see is the movie cover. And the scene the movie cover depicts, is not even in the movie.

You end up sitting through 2 hours of distorted recordings and muffled voices. Top that with the fact that everything the movie portrays as ""real events"" are actually fake events created to market the movie and you end up with a blair witch project wannabe. And a lousy one at that. I want my 2 hours back.",1268438400,9,1123,4.446601941747573

4044817,3,B0030DGHL0,"Aside from the obvious arguments/discussions that ensue about the content and validity of this film, I was hoping for a solid Blu to support the film, but instead they went for a near bare-bones release.

The display of the film never gives any significant clarity test with the split screens, low-res ""real"" footage, screens of static, distortion and constant need to have the shots out of focus. Roughly half of the chapter stops show some beautiful Alaskan footage, with one brief reference shot of the night sky at the 80-minute mark. Otherwise, I feel the landscape and majority of aerial footage gets wasted with the dark lens he used. The DTS gets plenty of usage and provides some solid treble/highs/mids with all of the screaming and jump-in-your-seat music stops. The supplements are scant and only include:

* Deleted scenes, 25 minutes. Plenty to see here with regards to alternate ""real"" footage and additional character stuff. Fans of this film and story will probably like the cuts, especially since these would have made this mess two hours long.
* DBox enabled, did not use it.
* BD Live, found nothing new regarding this film.
* pocketBlu, did not use it.
* DVS, always a nice thing to have on these Blus.

No region coding listed, English, Spanish and French languages with subs in same. Descriptive Video Service was fun to listen to as I wanted to hear they could describe some of the scenes - even they had some difficulty in transcribing this farce. Not a fan of the BD and can only recommend it as a rental. Two for the film and quality, one star for the extras.",1268352000,4,1586,4.697841726618705
4044818,5,B0030DGHL0,"It's a great movie with a great story about alien abductions in a small fictional town. Milla Jovovich is a reason alone to watch the movie. I love mockumentaries, but there's going to be thousands of tards that think this movie's real..",1268265600,,237,4.666666666666667
4044819,5,B0030DGHL0,"what pretty people aren't believable ???????????????? Geeze.. Plenty of us are pretty that are Abductee's and though it is mentioned about Abigail not being so pretty to make it more believable you would be surprised at all the handsome and beautiful women that get taken from their beds at night. But one reviewer said that Abigail is believable because she is not pretty or as pretty as the actress??? Geeze again. I'm both a Contactee and Abductee and folks that are skeptics to this point shouldn't write reviews because we Abductee's work our butts off and also put ourselves in harms way just to share our stories of TRUE events.

If a person is not a believer, or is a skeptic then I would suggest folks not see the film at all, though it's understandable that we start at one point of reference, yet, if not open minded, then why bother to look for truth and to me the part of the pretty versus not so pretty just tells me it's not been looked at properly and it is by far an untruth. If truth were to be told more handsome and beautiful people are taken then not, but then again isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder for the ETs, take those that are Spiritually beautiful, not those that are not. It's all about Spirituality. Anyway, it does a disservice to those that do believe.

Of course I guess the film is trying to snap folks out of their pathological skeptic attitudes and to hope to at least give a clue to most in the world that deny their existence. NOTHING out of this world can ever be proven enough to a skeptic OR a Researcher. Listen to Michio Kaku's view on ET's presence, being a Physicist he and many others say we are just plain arrogant to think we are the only ones in existence with the great cosmos out there. It's nearly 0 Zero chance we are alone and the only ones. Folks need to research ancient writings and ancient artifacts and most of all listen to testimony of the Experiencer whether it be from Benevolent or Malevolent Et's. Besides this though, nothing can prove the existence of God yet many have testimony of His/Her presence, as well as Angels and so here we go on and on and on until we snap out of it and realize, possibly its NOT meant to be proven to those that lack faith or belief. I know the ETs visit those that are Spiritual and many that are Spiritual have both faith and belief and I'm NOT talking about Religious, I'm talking about Spiritual and there is quite the difference.

Anyway, if your a person that wants to watch film for horror's sake, I guess this could be a film for you, but I'm thinking it is more geared to those that believe rather then those that don't believe and it's not geared for the skeptic or one that writes everything off, or one who tries with all their heart to look logical beyond reason for logic is a big down fall and a block to receiving what would have been truth if only they wanted to know it for most that are skeptical DON'T want to know.. They say they do, they may even think they do, but down inside they really don't want it.

I think this film was to make people think and snap out of the stone age of denial.  And by the way, there are plenty of Scientists, Doctors, Scholars and Physicists that believe in ETs existence, I know because I have been for 5 years on large forums with them. I have got thousands of pages of writings on this and also video's of testimony that go on as far as the eye can see. Proof !!  There is plenty, even videos galore on them. Also those expert in viewing and analyzing them saying that it is a real deal film, untampered with and the whole bit. So anyway, there is most assuredly proof that ETs exist, and all one has to do is join the forums to learn from Experiencer's firstly then the Researcher secondly for the Researcher only gets their material from the Experiencer.

We CANNOT deny thousands upon thousands of testimony worldwide, not to mention Governments on De Classified documents that are finally coming out little by little, especially in other countries for the U.S is behind the times on this, but NOR can we deny the existence of Ancient Artifacts and writings that show beyond all doubt of their interaction with earth since the inception of this planet up to this very day.. Nor wonderful souls like Shaman's like Credu Mutwa and many others. Too many of us are Experiencer's and KNOW .. We don't think, We don't believe, We KNOW first hand.

Instead of criticizing a film so harshly, which I guess some perceive as being a good review, well just know that there are just as many that do not appreciate the lack of understanding on this topic when one is written. Go to the horses mouth for the truth, the Experiencer, not the skeptic or the mainstream paradim folk person that has an agenda or paradim they are trapped in who has to have everything fit tidy in a nice little folder of acceptable or non acceptability. By the way, its a crime to not listen to testimony while at the same time wishing for proof, for by ignoring, folks ignore the MOST important part of the truth of this, and that is the testimony and with it often many answers to so many questions the world has sought for for a very long time, but if they seek with a paradim they are victim to then I""m afraid they will never be satisfied enough, EVER..

The truth be told most Contactee's and Abductee's are told to NOT share due to harsh responses from the public and so while the Contactee is contacted by Benevolent races (Of many kinds by the way and NOT just typical Greys and Reptoids) but while the Contactee's receive benevolent communion with (non abductions), while at the same time the Abductee's are contacted by Malevolent, it's a strange think but both sides wish us to not subject ourselves to the harsh world by revealing our encounters for the most part, though a few of us have openly, its a hard road and one that is not fun with public reaction and the ET's rather us not be subjected to the changing of material that ends up in someone's book and so many of us are writing books now to share our encounters and our long personal history with them.

Anyway, those that are Experiencer's of either kind will find this film very accurate in many ways and why I say only in many ways is because Abduction has approx what I have called a 15% or thereabout similarity between one Abductee and another, but I call the other 85% totally unique, and so though the unique part is innumerable in experience from one to another, the like part you will recognize. The unique part is just this way due to many factors including which race of ET your dealing with and there are many offshoots even with the Greys world, as well as the Reptilians and many different types within each race and with many different agenda's as well. As well as there is thousands of races watching over mankind now in great anticipation for a change to take place upon our Earth, and so besides this you have your own personal memories, experiences both in this life and other lives, as well as being a product of your own environment and raising up, culture differences between people, different likes and dislikes, and many things effect the dream scapes the Greys and some notorious ones such as the Reptilians use, due to them wanting to target our emotions and trigger us to go the direction they wish us to go and they need our own personal individual self and memories to do that.. Those like the Pleiadian's and other Benevolent ones will be more straight forward because they are not allowed to usurp or manipulate a person that they are in Contact with nor are they allowed to Abduct, or influence a persons will for they plainly view this as a broken Universal Law of Free Will to do anything but, then you have the Acturians, Sirians, and so many types out there you could not imagine. My point is many of us have had contact with more then one race and it is very very common. Watch some of Anna Hayes videos or Jordan Maxwell and EXPERT on many things that will open your eyes and get the ball rolling.

The movie is a great eye opener for those that are starting to awaken and for the Experiencer and yet if you like horror I guess this would be a good one for you too.",1267920000,,8201,4.406600660066006

This movie is god awful. The film shows actual footage AND dramatizations AT THE SAME TIME, in a split screen scenario. This is the last thing I want to see. Either make the movie using real footage and a narrator or give me a dramatization, OR transition from one to another. But, putting them side by side in the same frame in every intense scene is horrible decision making. It just didn't work for me and the 3 people I went to the theater with to see it.

In terms of horror factor, there definitely are a few really frightening moments... one scene particular comes to mind, but again, most scenes were ruined by the director's way of building suspense with the split screen. Fire in the Sky is still the best alien abduction movie out there. It's really hard for me to recommend purchasing this movie. Rental at best.

 Half way through you're OK. But then it gets weaker and weaker until you find no end to ""The End"". At least not in the traditional Horror, Sci-fi genre.

No resolve!
 The cinematography is awfully pale considering the location.

4044829,1,B0030DGHL0,"Being stationed in Korea, there isn't very much to do, especially if you're under 21. Hell, over here you can't even go off base unless your 21, so yeah, nothing to do but watch movies. Fortunately there is a theater on base, sure it shows movies that have been out forever (Avatar, 2012, etc) but occasionally it shows a movie that I haven't seen, like The Fourth Kind. I remember when I went to see Paranormal Activities that I thought these two films were one and the same. They were marketed in much the same way and their plots seemed eerily similar, plus it didn't help that I hadn't done research on either films. When I realized my mistake I was a little embarrassed but not too much. After all, it allowed me to see PA when I probably would have skipped it, plus it put off seeing this God awful excuse for a film.

Set in Nome Alaska, The Fourth Kind is about ""actual case studies"" telling the story of actual people who were abducted by aliens. Yeah right. These people go all out trying to make us believe this nonsense, making spooky X-Files ish monologues with our main characters standing in the middle of a forest at night with a flood light shining behind them telling us about how everything in this film is real, that we can chose to believe it if we want or reject it completely, informing us about how the FBI seems oh SOOO interested in Name. Forget the fact that this is all complete bull, and anyone with an ounce of sense can see through this ""scary"" drivel. I mean really people, did ANYONE fall for this? Anyone? Here's a hint. It is mentioned that the main character, the real one not the ""dramatized""
Version, is still trying to convince people her story is true even appearing in an interview retelling it for everyone, and yet they would have us believe that she wants to use an alias instead of her real name. Right. Of COURSE that would be the case and the whole alias thing isn't some cheap trick to keep people from googling the names and finding out the movie is complete BS. THAT couldn't be the reason. I've seen movies ""based on actual events"" that try to make people think their real and do a good job at it (Paranormal Activities, Blare Witch Project) but this is some absurd. What this movie is, is just two films (one made in the same way PA was, one the Hollywood version) spliced together to give the appearance of realism, and its SOOOOO easy to tell. Not that PA or Blare Witch actually made me think those events were real, but good God they didn't go to the absurd lengths this film did to make me believe. This movie just bashes you over the head over and over and over, trying to make you believe this nonsense, but it's not. Give it a rest.

Other than that, this film is very gimmicky. I thought the split screens went out of style when the first Hulk movie tanked; I was under the impression that Hollywood realized that was a VERY bad idea. Nobody likes split screens, it's confusing, it gets in the way of the action, and it gives me a headache. Apparently the makers of this movie didn't get the hint. Remember how I said this is really just two movies with two different sets of actors spliced together? Guess how they do it? They play the same exact scene from both versions at the same time by splitting the screen between the two. So, you see a crummy home made version of the scene, and a glamorized Hollywood version, right next to each other, both doing the same exact thing. Apparently, this was done to make it seem more real. Please, don't insult my intelligence. But the problem with the split screens doesn't end there, oh no, it gets better than that. There was one specific scene I remember where not only did we get the two different versions of the movie placed side by side, both of those scenes were split as well leaving four, yes four, screens to follow. What's more these four screens kept changing in size, pulsing as it were, while poor little ol me tried desperately to figure out what the hell as going on. Oh, and the audio kept switching from the ""real"" footage to the Hollywood footage, adding to the confusion.

Other gimmicks? Well, as I said before, there's the X-Files ish ""the movie is based on real events"" monologues at the beginning and end of the film, there's also the aliens speaking in a thousand year old dead language claiming that it (whatever it is) is God. Oh, THAT didn't sound gimmicky at all. The alien talking to the screaming woman while she pleads for her child to be returned and then claiming that it is God. Hmm, yeah, and I'm supposed to think that if an alien spoke on tape before and claimed it was god that I wouldn't have heard about it before now? That this wouldn't be the most famous video clip ever? Didn't they say this movie was based on real life? Yeah, I think they did, about a dozen times.

I won't say that the movie didn't frighten me on occasion. It did. There were some scares in it, and there were a few things that were well done, but the bad in this film FAR outweighs anything they did right. It had a good concept, there were some scares, and there was also some great imagery (the owls were great I thought) but boy oh boy, was this film gimmicky or what? I won't tell you not to see it, this movie could be like PA, hit or miss depending on the viewers, but I didn't like it, not in the least bit.

Replay value, low.",1263686400,10,5354,4.3607214428857715
4044830,2,B0030DGHL0,"Something strange is going on in Nome, Alaska. That's what ""The Fourth Kind"" claims. According to the film written and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, while treating her patients, Dr. Abigail Tyler, a psychiatrist living in Nome, discovered horrible truths behind the unexplained missing person cases in the town - that is, sort of ""A Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind.""

Milla Jovovich (Alice of the ""Resident Evil"" series) plays the role of Dr. Abigail Tyler. At the beginning of the film Ms Jovovich stands before the camera as herself, an actress, and then she appears as Dr. Abigail Tyler, psychiatrist and mother of two children. Dr. Tyler puts her insomniac patients under hypnosis - all of them say they have seen the same thing, an owl - but the doctor's treatment results in disastrous consequences. There are more details to come in this thin story, which, told in a straightforward way, is in fact nothing but a weak episode in ""The X-Files"" series.

Osunsanmi's ""fact-based thriller"" is in a way more ambitious than Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of The Third Kind."" I mean ""The Fourth Kind"" is so intent on being authentic that the film employs several narrative gimmicks such as the use of ""actual audio"" tapes and the ""real"" interview footage (where Osunsanmi himself appears as interviewer). At some points both ""actual footage"" and ""re-enacted footage"" even appear side by side, using the 1960-ish split screen technique.

Despite (or because of) the elaborated way in which the film's story is presented, we soon realize that what ""The Fourth Kind"" is trying to do is nothing new, except its pseudo-documentary style, which itself is not enough to keep us interested. Actually the whole film is not interesting. It is not scary either, except, perhaps, the haggard face of the ""real"" Abigail Tyler. She scared me a lot.",1261612800,3,1845,5.003257328990228

Evidently the target audience for The Fourth Kind is aimed at gullible morons because that's exactly what you would have to be to fall for what this film so desperately wants you to believe; that it's real.

The Fourth Kind did exactly the opposite for me, of what it intended. Throughout the entire film we are constantly being reminded that it's a movie. Every time an actor comes into frame, they announce it with subtitles: Will Patton - actor. As if that's not bad enough, the first thing we see is Milla Jovovich standing in the woods somewhere. She proclaims loudly, ""I'm actress, Milla Jovovich,"" then she goes on to explain that we are going to watch a movie and we are going, `Yeah we got that lady, that's why we are here'.

Then she tells us that some of the events that we will be viewing are true and that for dramatic purposes actors have been hired to act out those emotional scenes but that they will be played simultaneously along with the real footage. What? Why?

And just as she promised, the director uses a split-screen method with the supposed real footage being on the left and the footage with shiny big actors in it on the right. The actors on the right act out nearly everything verbatim that is happening at the exact same time on the left side of the screen. Who in their right mind in Hollywood thought this would be entertaining?

The biggest reason that this did not work for me aside from the fact that it was aggravating and beyond boring; was that the actors they hired to act on the right side of the screen, were way better actors than the ones they hired to play the real people who weren't supposed to be acting, on the left side! How am I supposed to believe that the footage on the left is real when Milla Jovovich's adaptation of it is astronomically more impressive and believable? They would have been better off saying that this all really happened to Milla Jovovich and shot it with a home video camera.

The film takes place in Nome Alaska. We are told that over the last several years, numerous people have vanished unexplainably. The point behind the film is that supposedly these people were abducted by aliens.

Milla Jovovich re-enacts the role of a psychiatrist by the name of Abbey Tyler. We see `real footage' of the person her character is based on, interviewing patients. Her name has been changed of course but there she is right there in front of us on the screen, so what was the point of changing her name? Right.

And isn't there some kind of psychiatrist / patient confidentiality clause that protects people from being humiliated? Apparently none of the people on the left side of the screen had a problem with Hollywood glamorizing their violent and no doubt traumatic abductions. Again, right.

Tyler's research discloses that several of her patients have reported being awakened in the night at around the same time and having weird visits from spooky owls. What this has to do with the aliens is beyond me.

Despite how terribly lame the film is, you get outstanding performances out of Will Patton, Milla Jovovich and another actor that has been overlooked for far too long; Elias Koteas. I get the sense that none of these great actors knew just what the final product was going to look like.

I will admit that the director did do some amazing things cinema-graphically on the right side of the screen and the footage they show on the left is pretty creepy at times; but whenever there is an `alien incident' let's call it, the camera conveniently loses focus and is blurred out of our vision and we are left only with screams of horror and shaky camera movements.

Oh, and when their spaceship comes, yeah that makes the camera blurry as well. The aliens don't mind that all of this is filmed, because it's obviously fake.... I mean because the cameras get all fuzzy so there is no way they can get caught. That's what I meant to say.",1260921600,3,4237,4.659517426273458
4044832,3,B0030DGHL0,"The trouble with ""found footage"" movies is that they're hard to pull off well. Most, if not all, are compared to the ""Blair Witch Project"" which was hyped up on the Internet and an almost guaranteed blockbuster beforehand.

That said, there has been the occasional success. I loved ""Paranormal Activity"", even though I knew it was staged. It was just real enough to do the intended job (ie scare the crap out of me). ""The Fourth Kind"" didn't have quite the web-hype that ""Blair Witch"" had, though a website or two was created beforehand to lend it legitimacy.

Basically, the ""footage"" is a series of videos taken by psychiatrist Abigail Tyler of patients in session. The video is inter cut with ""re-enactments"" of the supposedly real events by some very talented actors including Milla Jovovich, Will Patton and Elias Koteas. The patients all have something in common, a dream or possible hallucination, or real experience in which they all observed an owl looking at them during the night when they woke up. Under hypnosis, the patients all reveal that something very nasty and scary happened to them...this was no owl, it was abduction.

The movie's title plays on the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""'s, the ""third"" kind being contact and the ""fourth"" abduction.

The movie offers a slightly new take on the ""found footage"" premise. Whether you believe that the videos shot by Tyler are real or not, the cutting back and forth between the grainy ""home movies"" and decent-quality footage gives the eyes (and ears) a break.

Without wanting to give away too much, the film follows Tyler's investigation and tries to show evidence of alien abductions. When ""aliens"" are involved, the video shot by Tyler becomes very grainy, sufficiently to not reveal too much, but to show enough, in theory, to make us wonder. The story feels long and drawn-out. Director Olatunde Osunsanmi who also wrote the story which is loosely based on some disappearances in Nome, Alaska, tries too hard to convince us and tries a little too hard to put twists and turns in an attempt (in my humble opinion) to give us that feeling many of us got at the end of ""The Sixth Sense"" when all was revealed. The talent on display tries hard but the story lets them down. Perhaps cinema has evolved too much for this kind of story to work very well, but then I look at ""Paranormal Activity"" and think otherwise.

As with other ""footage"" movies, ""The Fourth Kind"" relies on a few good scares. There are a couple of very good scenes that made me jump in my seat, but I felt they were overdue but did not make up for the rest of the film.

If you're a UFO / abduction believer then you may quite like this one. For me, it was ""okay"". It wasn't brilliant. I'd certainly watch it on DVD if I picked it up cheaply, but it certainly isn't anywhere close to it's predecessors. I would add that some of the scenery is beautiful and there is some excellent camera work, especially on wide shots.",1260489600,2,2958,4.655172413793103
4044833,4,B0030DGHL0,"Let's face it,

I LOVE THIS MOVIE. PLEASE MAKE MORE - AND THE MORE SINISTER , THE BETTER.

Man - made and 'alien made'UFO's have existed since time immorial.
But this film may not exist for time immorial , however. It will thrieve in our memories as one of the funnest to make films of 2009 , when people went into imaginary journeys to imaginary places to tell other people that they had had imaginary experiences , which would later be turned into advanced , highly skillful and creative film projects.
The Fourth Kind was really never about anybody or anything 'else'than the storyline and the characters OF THE FILM ITSELF.
That is what most people felt it so hard to believe. There is another , very little known film out there that is titled The Beings. I suggest amazon.com find somebody who can make it selleable here , because it's a very well done sci - fi film and can be compared to the Fourth Kind in many ways.
It is indeed true that the film models it's storyline after the content of alien abduction accounts , and there is nothing wrong with that.
The way I see it there was nothing wrong in the overall production or introduction of the movie. I have also read theories about that it was part of the ploy to stage a fake alien invasion in 2012 , which I think is very probably going to be cancelled now that we know all about it.
The aliens in the Fourth Kind are based on the classic gray archetype of alien , and the whole mockumentary cooperates much better with me as a film in my view than Paranormal Activity did , and also because the settings are so completely different. The Fourth Kind cannot be considered as sucessful or sinister as the Wicksboro Incident , and we need more movies like that , and maybe some of them could be over 2 or 3 hours long.
I am glad that we know now finally after all these years. What saddens me however , is the extremes and the length to how people can go in order to marketize products such as this. They could have spared the efforts to make the film more convincing than it really is , and realize that there will always be a hardcore of fans of this type of film , and they will not care much if the producer states it's based on actual events or not. If the music works , if the script works , if the play works , that's what counts. If the project is based on actual events , that is always talked about after the film has been viewed. I never bought into most of the stories that the Fourth Kind material presented , and I loved how the film does not demand that you believe in anything that takes place within it's content. If you want to create a seriously sinister UFO abduction movie you have to put yourself into the shoes of the antagonists and the 'bad guys'of the film and not focus on the good guys solely. You also have to make sure the music works just like they did in this film - and then , everything comes out perfect! You've got a film that works and THAT'S WHAT COUNTS , not whether it's factual or not.
Too bad the 20000 USD had to be wasted into an effort which could have costed far , far less!!
If the directors or producers choose to wait for maybe a few months they could produce another similar film and also  use guerilla marketing , and make far more people die in it and have seriously sinister scenes that won't rely that much on very expensive special effect. Now that we have seen the making of mockumentaries about crazy ghosts , dumbass aliens and moody demons that go bump in the night , it's about time that somebody did a mockumentary about werewolves (there are some about zombies now that I know of but I had forgotten to mention them). THAT would be REALLY fun to watch , especially on a place like [...] or [...]. Way to go! Brilliant piece of work! Good music also.",1258156800,4,3772,4.26536312849162
4044834,5,B0030DGHL0,"I'm studying UFO's and the extraterrestrial hypothesis in relation to nationalist fears of invasion and knowledge production.  I do have to say that this symptom of pathological skepticism runs deep into our culture.  We are taught to be empirical but ultimately, our experiences are rendered meaningless unless it can be verified by an institution or state apparatus, and that these institutions and apparatuses are beyond question and without motivation.  People who have been abducted have been particularly and roundly persecuted and ridiculed by ""scientists"" and government institutions.  In their defense people who study this phenomena often are better scientists because they have to be even more objective and critical.  In any case any evidence that is presented will never be good enough.  Photographs will be said to be photo-shopped, videos will be said to be doctored, witnesses will be said to be deluded, suffering from sleep paralysis.  The evidence is never really looked at and instead ""scientists"" commence to character assassinate and talk about a cookie that the experiencer stole when they were three.  I think these people and their experiences negative or positive, need to be told.  A weather balloon, with a string of Christmas lights and 20 drunks doesn't strike me as a good explanation.

  Actually this movie doesn't simply say ""based on a true story"" it says that this is real footage.  A director would not have gone that far if he was just doing a science fiction film.  However I am not certain what the law is regarding truth in film.  The scene inside the space ship in the movie Fire in the Sky did not occur in Travis Walton's account but was just added for entertainment (though the abduction did occur). I am curious just how permission to release this footage, especially the police footage, would have gotten released considering that some of it might still be part of an investigation.  While I think we should all be skeptics, people who purport to be scientific really base their knowledge on faith that how that knowledge was produced was truly objective.  Maybe we should stop giving knowledge about our world a free pass just because some one is an ""expert"" and start actually opening our eyes to the world around us which we ignore because experts do all of the work for us.  They can essentially tell us anything and we will believe them.  I will try to be less egotistical when I start interviewing experiencers, provided they will even talk to an anthropologist.  By the way, I thought the movie was great.",1257724800,10,2559,4.948477751756441
4044835,2,B0030DGHL0,"This movie only pretends to be based on anything real. There were some disappearances in Nome, but nobody had any UFO sightings or hallucinations.  It's all just marketing to pretend there was anything like it going on, and all the actors are actors, there are no real doctors in the movie. So, they start off by lying, because if they pretend it's real, they can get you to watch something that isn't very interesting or well done. It doesn't have a whole lot of action, just a lot of acting out emotions, mainly fear and confusion.  It's pretty much exactly like something you'd see on the Discovery channel and hardly worth paying the price of a ticket or a DVD.",1257724800,3,665,4.533333333333333
