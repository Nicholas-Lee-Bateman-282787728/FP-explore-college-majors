8114291,3,B000EU1Q36,"I watched this series when it was first on TV. Now that I have watched the DVDs, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the first season, & maybe the second season. Clark Kent is Superman! Once Lois knows about it, he grovels around like a sick puppy in love; and she takes control of his life. I couldn't wait to finish the third season.",1168646400,,333,4.138461538461539
8114292,5,B000EU1Q36,"I loved this show when it aired and watching it now on DVD is just as fantastic as it was in the 90's! If you have ever enjoyed the story of endering love between Lois Lane and Clark Kent then you have to watch this show. Dean Cain plays a wonderfully charming Clark Kent and he and Teri Hatcher have a great chemistry together. Teri is a funny-cute but sexy Lois. You fall in love with the characters, including Perry and Jimmy, especially in the second and third seasons which are my favorites. Can't wait until the release of season 4!",1155081600,,538,4.336633663366337
8114293,5,B000EU1Q36,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad when the show ended because like so many other fans I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. As kids my best friend Maria and I would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. It is awesome to see this show finally come to DVD. I encourage all of the fans to buy this amazing collection and to write your reviews on how much you enjoyed this great show. Below is a complete episode list of the first, second, and third Season of Lois & Clark and lets hope the final fourth season will see a DVD release soon.
