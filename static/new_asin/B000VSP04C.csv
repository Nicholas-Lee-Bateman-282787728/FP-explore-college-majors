8219830,4,B000VSP04C,"Not much to say that everyone hasn't already said. Such powerful star quality in these films, they have lasted all these years and still make people happy in a world gone crazy.
Love the songs...the girls and the stories where no one really gets hurt, and showing forgiveness and having ethics was what people stood for. I wish that was important to people today but.....that's something else that has sadly been lost.
Wonderful entertainment.",1408147200,,443,5.0
