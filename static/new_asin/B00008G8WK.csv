1846290,5,B00008G8WK,Thank You!!!,1412812800,,12,5.5
1846291,3,B00008G8WK,Marjorie Reynolds of this movie is wonderful. I like singing scenes. But I am disappointed because a picture is not clear. I want you to release DVD by high-resolution digital remastering.,1376697600,,188,5.096774193548387
1846292,3,B00008G8WK,"Ah, the joys of Frankie Darro and Mantan Moreland. Darro was among Monogram Pictures' biggest drawing cards in 1940, before The East Side Kids became the studio's resident little tough guys. Frankie Darro often played jockeys and villains in major-studio movies, but his Monograms gave him more opportunities for his acting skills and comic flair (Monogram held on to him, in one capacity or another, for another 10 years).
""Up in the Air"" is one of Darro's better outings and a typical Monogram feature, with presentable but not lavish production values, and a serviceable supporting cast dotted with some familiar faces. When a difficult diva dies mysteriously, radio-station pageboy Frankie and his pal Mantan keep one step ahead of the cops and try to identify the killer. The mystery is interesting enough, but there is a good deal of comedy and music to help the proceedings along. Marjorie Reynolds sings, the pop-eyed Moreland clowns and dances, and when Moreland goes into his famous ""incomplete-sentence"" comedy routine, his partner is none other than Frankie Darro in blackface, doing an extremely good imitation of Freeman Gosden (of ""Amos 'n' Andy"")! Serial fans will enjoy seeing Tristram Coffin and Lorna Gray (a/k/a Adrian Booth) in supporting roles.
Picture and sound are very good, from a fine 16mm print. This is a good one from Alpha's budget-price video line (the graphics on the packaging are superb), and B-movie fans and late-late-show viewers with long memories should enjoy this.",1066867200,32,1505,5.172131147540983

1846323,4,B00008G8WK,I t was so much fun watching Mantan Moreland - I always thought he was so funny,1477180800,,79,3.7058823529411766
1846324,3,B00008G8WK,Great seeing some old who done it movies. Very classic.,1476230400,,55,4.6
1846325,4,B00008G8WK,Good old movie with many laughs there are some  racial slurs but when the movie was made no problems but good family movie,1476057600,,122,4.304347826086956

1846328,3,B00008G8WK,"Fun, quick moving ""B"" movie with a couple of Mantan's classic routines.  It was strange to see a white guy in black face playing his partner in one routine.",1475539200,,156,4.379310344827586
1846329,2,B00008G8WK,"I usually  love all those 30's and 40's B movies, but this one I just couldn't get into.  I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1475366400,,122,4.260869565217392
1846330,4,B00008G8WK,"Pretty good for what it is. It isn't amazing, it is a generic mystery of the time, but it' not a bad way to spend and hour as far as I am concerned. If you are racially sensitive, then Mantan Moreland's performance (and a short scene with the lead white character in black face) may be hard to take. As far as Mr. Moreland is concerned, I take the view that he made a good living in a less than enlightened time. More power to him.",1474848000,,431,4.023255813953488

1846338,3,B00008G8WK,"Mantan Moreland  stars in this movie and I see it as a historical event. The v ery first ""modern day"" movie which had a man of color as one of the leading stars. The plot is simple, the jokes and comedy relative to the era but the actors all were exceptional.",1474416000,,259,4.078431372549019

1846349,5,B00008G8WK,A fascinating look at 40s integrated Hollywood. All great characters. Mantan is THE best. Check him out in the Charlie Chan films.,1473638400,,130,4.954545454545454
1846350,3,B00008G8WK,Typical murder mystery from the time period but one I hadn't seen.,1473638400,,66,4.583333333333333

1846356,4,B00008G8WK,"An engaging murder mystery movie from the Monogram pictures heydays. The characters, dialogue and banter are both snappy and fun.  While some of the banter routines between Frankie Darro and Mantan Moreland aren't quite up to the level of other Monogram productions, like the Charlie Chan series, they're still entertaining and fun to watch.",1472774400,3,341,5.314814814814815
1846357,4,B00008G8WK,Very entertaining movie! Played back great on Prime.,1471737600,,52,5.625
1846358,2,B00008G8WK,"Unnecessary  and unfunny ""blackface"" scene.  Very objectionable.
Mantan Moreland  does have a good, but too short  soft shoe dance sequence.",1471046400,,140,5.85
1846359,5,B00008G8WK,"I love old movies. Although murder is not a funny topic,  this movie was not heavy/scary. The interplay between actors was pleasant. Everyone was on ""equal"" ground. There were laughs and the bad guy was caught.",1469491200,,210,4.833333333333333
1846360,2,B00008G8WK,Dumb and out of date in its portrayal of blacks.,1468627200,,48,3.9
1846361,5,B00008G8WK,Fast moving b-movie. Marjorie Reynolds lights up the screen with her  a-movie talent Good purchase for the discount price.,1444262400,,122,5.421052631578948
7983751,2,B00008G8WK,I am a fan of Mantan Moreland.  Although his comedy is considered racist by today's standards it was great in its day (he as a staple in the Charlie Chan Mysteries with Sidney Tolar). But I didn't really enjoy this one. It just wasn't all that good. The plot was weak and the character interaction contrived. I don't recommend it.,1500249600,,330,4.5
7983752,5,B00008G8WK,Hope is fantastic in his early years and movies I just can't even imagine I watch these movies and I think that's Bob Hope?,1489708800,,123,4.166666666666667
7983753,4,B00008G8WK,I like old movies!,1486166400,,18,3.75
7983754,4,B00008G8WK,"Up in the Air is typical of the comedy/mystery genre popular in the 1930's and 40's. The plot lines generally included a couple of mysterious deaths, a couple of funny men leads, at least one pretty singer and some bumbling cops. Up in the Air follows all of the above elements. The movie was entertaining. Not a classic by any means but entertaining none the less as an example of the genre.
One unusual aspect of the movie is the use of Maatan Moreland as the comedy second banana. Normally he played the broad racial stereotype of the day, kind of the minstrel shoe buffoon. He was clearly the friend and equal of the male lead, Frankie Darro, not his butler or chauffeur as was typical at the time.",1486166400,,702,4.449612403100775
