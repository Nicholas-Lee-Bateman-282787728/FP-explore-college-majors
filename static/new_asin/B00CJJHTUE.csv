8582609,3,B00CJJHTUE,This set was a DVR rip subbed by fans. Although it was ripped from DVR the quality is good. The subtitles are lacking due to being fan subs. Some segments are not subbed or poorly subbed. Sometimes the sub formatting was pretty bad but overall it wasn't too bad. If you're looking for the official thing this is not it but if you're looking to just enjoy the series then this might be for you.,1447113600,,393,4.253333333333333
