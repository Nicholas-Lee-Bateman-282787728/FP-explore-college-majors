2836945,5,B000QFAFNQ,"I've been a fan of Gabriel's for years and this special of his is fantastic. The special by itself is well worth owning, but fans of good special features and of stand up comedy alike will applaud the decision by the producers to include the performances of the other comedians who performed that night. I've been a fan of stand-up ever since I was a kid and I've attended numerous live performances. It was really nice to see Martin Moreno, Noe and Mando warm up the crowd before Gabriel came in for the kill. Buy this DVD and support Hot and Fluffiness!",1189296000,,555,4.450980392156863
2836946,5,B000QFAFNQ,"Well this is a young guy with a huge future ahead of him. This guy is just plain funny. The first time I saw was on a Comedy Central presents and on Last Comic Standing. Gabriel is funny, his voices, his sounds and his honesty (most importantly) are the elements that will drive you to watch him over and over. Sometimes even pause the DVD cause you can't hear the jokes since you are laughing so hard. Trust me this a DVD worth watching and of course buying.",1189296000,,459,4.2272727272727275
2836947,5,B000QFAFNQ,"I'm so glad a DVD of this comic genius finally came out! We saw him live in Sacramento and he promised a hilarious story on the DVD and sure enough, it's the final joke, and truly, it was funny, huh?!!  Love this guy!",1189209600,,217,4.046511627906977
2836948,5,B000QFAFNQ,"Fluffy is a very funny and fun loving movie. Gabriel Iglesias is a very funny
up coming comic and has a lot of  talent. I feel it is an excellent buy for those who love to laugh and for those who need a good laugh.",1188950400,,214,3.7555555555555555
2836949,5,B000QFAFNQ,Gabriel Iglesias is the funniest young comedian I have seen in a long time.  Everyone should see this DVD.  It's completely hysterical!!  LOVE IT!!!,1188950400,,148,5.083333333333333
2836950,4,B000QFAFNQ,I love this video but it gets old after watching it about the 3rd or 4th time. I think it is worth buying tho.,1188345600,,110,3.625
2836951,5,B000QFAFNQ,"(I have a feeling all reviews for this DVD is going to have at least one ""fluffy"" reference...)
Gabriel Iglesias is absolutely hysterical on this DVD!  His CD Pikachu I See You is great and his Comedy Central appearances are always terrific and this DVD is no exception. His stories, his voices & impressions and just generally outrageous and still totally adorable delivery makes this DVD a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes to laugh!!!",1186617600,24,434,4.786666666666667
2836952,5,B000QFAFNQ,"How my ratings work:
5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

Gabriel Iglesias is one funny dude. He has a lot of energy for a fluffy guy. I remember him when he was on the Nickelodeon show All That and he was funny on there. I didn't see anything of him for a couple years until I saw him on Comedy Central Presents (which was awesome). This routine is even better, partly because it's longer than the last one, and because it's got funnier stuff. He's great with impersonations, goofy voices, and sound effects. I hope to see more of him in the future, both in stand up and movies.",1186531200,23,682,4.08955223880597
2836953,5,B000QFAFNQ,"I can't wait to see him live later this year.  I'm a big fan of his, and this made me like him even more.  The end joke about the two ""hoochies"" following his car and then both of the cars getting pulled over.  The punchline was priceless.  I sure hope he doesn't get too political with his comedy, but it was a 5 star stand up.  If anyone wants to know, there's some jokes that get repeated but other than that, it's pretty much new material.  Which is a good thing with an uprising comic.  Check it out folks!",1186531200,14,511,4.101010101010101

On the radio I find them funny even when they are repeated and look forward to a few of them as I hear them coming.  This show just didn't seem to stand up, it seemed as though the delivery was off and the jokes I hadn't heard didn't seem that funny.

How can you not like a guy who talks about tacos, donuts, and real cake?  While I would not let the little kiddos watch this, older kids would be fine.  He rarely curses and doesn't talk about sex.  He does talk about a trip to a strip club but does not go into detail.  There is some talk about drinking and one story where a friend has illegal drugs.

Gabriel Iglesias is the most hilarious comediennes out their. He's not your typical comedienne who makes up all his jokes and punchlines, all his jokes are his real life experiences!

Also like one person said he can do sounds effects like a true master amazed me what he could do with his voice and a mike.  What did it for me was the bit with the cop pulling them over and pulling the gun on Iglesias freind and then saying ""but that's funny right there.""  I will buy more of this comedian's stuff as he puts them out.  So if your into great humor and an comedian who can do great voiceover work with a mike, then pick this DVD up and prepare for a very funny night and maybe have some tissues for the tears of laughter you may have from this guy's show.",1338681600,,735,3.939189189189189

He can tell a story so well and I'd say it's pretty much somewhere between PG and PG-13 level of topics. My pre-teen kids can be in the room while this is on and I don't have to send them away because of the language.

His stand up routine is about his every day life, but he delivers the jokes really well. Everything from being pulled over for speeding to life as a ""fluffy"" Mexican-American. He's the kind of person you would want to meet and hang out with just because of how funny his personality is. His stand up can crack a smile on even the hardest of critics. He's a natural comedian who knows how to tell a story. Definitely a must see!",1327449600,,725,4.253623188405797

His comedy is rich, funny, and family friendly. You cant say that about hardly any stand up comics. So enjoy it with your peeps, its ok.

2837672,5,B000QFAFNQ,It's rare for a comedian to have the gift of telling hilarious stories as well as finding patterns among people. Mr. Iglesias has both and it's very refreshing.

2837685,3,B000QFAFNQ,I watched about 25 minutes of it before I decided it just didn't interest me at all. His comedy mostly centered on making clever noises but ultimately his jokes weren't very funny. I watched it straight faced the whole time wanting to enjoy it but couldn't get into it. If you've seen him before and if you like beatboxing and other clever vocal play then you will undoubtedly enjoy it.,1302566400,,386,4.5285714285714285

He is a rare find in comedy when so many others have put their foot in the door for him to go through like he reminds us of in his act - Paul Rodegiez(spelling stinks), and George Lopez. They put their feet in the door for others to follow and become comedians. Gabriel is one of those guys and he has found his calling. I hope he continues his great work.",1302048000,,442,3.922222222222222

2837688,5,B000QFAFNQ,"My husband and I are lifelong fans of COMEDY CENTRAL. Over the years we have seen many a comedian try to coerce a laugh from our sometimes ""taking things too seriously"" faces. A number have been successful but none quite as successful as a few such as Gabriel Iglesias. I personally find him so adorably lovable that laughing to his crazy antics comes as naturally as breathing fresh air. As a slightly overweight person myself I adore the fact that he doesn't seem to mind being overweight himself and has classified himself as ""fluffy"" in the big-healthy-husky-fluffy-damn scale. He is refreshingly honest in admitting that he likes to eat and that the quality of life is more important to him than the quantity. I also think he is a genius in the use of sound effects to get someone to laugh. He admits that although he was not the Last Comic Standing in the competition so named, he was the ONLY one to have a special on COMEDY CENTRAL.

When he introduces his act on this tape Gabriel admits to having returned to Bakersfield, California where he first got his start. He introduces his mother to the audience and is ""equal opportunity"" as to who he pokes fun at--hispanic and non hispanic alike. He explains the reason he is always wearing Hawaiin shirts is simply that ""they fit"". He quips how Hawaiin people to him looked like ""swollen Mexicans"".  All in all he is one warm, funny, very talented comedian whose tape I would recommend to anyone who loves to laugh.",1295740800,2,1470,4.628352490421456

2837695,4,B000QFAFNQ,"Hot and Fluffy is funny fool.  Gabriel Iglesias is cute and great with sound effects and voices.  He doesn't need to resort to political or racist humor, he's creative enough to be hysterical without that.  With his self deprecating yet positive attitude, he is a rare breed among comics.

Hot and Fluffy starts out with a bang.  You learn about Gabriel Iglesias (that's ""E""glesias with an ""I"") the guy along the way, and his relationship with Law Enforcement.  The middle of the show does tend to drag a little, however, he closes with a bit that damn near made me ""wet myself.""

Fluffy, I'm mean Gabriel, is good clean fun.  He rarely talks about S E X, and when he does, he takes a turn for the cleaner punchline.  And I never heard him drop the F bomb. My 9 yr old wondered into the room when Hot and Fluffy was on, to see what we were laughing about. I let her watch a few bits and now she quotes him all the time.......O DA LAY!",1282780800,2,934,4.261363636363637

2837700,5,B000QFAFNQ,"Gabriel's Bakersfield performance is what made me a big fan of this incredibly underrated comic.  I tend to gravitate towards Latino stand-up comics, and it's difficult to escape the gravitational pull of someone so fluffy.

Gabriel has really fresh material, his sense of timing is great, and the man simply has tremendous stage presence.  With the exception of Pablo Francisco, Gabriel is also one of the only Latin comics that brings great impressions and voices to his performance.

I'm personally okay with swearing during a comedian's performance, but Gabriel coincidentally keeps his material fairly PG.  So if your kids are a bit too young for the likes of George Lopez or Juan Villarreal, this DVD would make for safe family movie night.

If you enjoy laughing out loud, treat yourself to this DVD.",1272067200,,807,5.030075187969925

Gabriel is flipping hysterical. He cracks me up with his self deprecating style and people learning to laugh at themselves once in awhile. He didn't touch on too many controversial topics or sound like he was asserting political opinions in his comedy. There is very mild foul language which, while it doesn't bother me if it is, I know it offends a lot of other people. I think most people could enjoy his comedy and not be too afraid of the kids overhearing some of it. I've seen this special several times, and he still makes me laugh every single time.",1267920000,,707,4.396946564885496

He spends much of this time talking about his weight and run in's with the cops which, when put together, will leave you laughing for more.

Note: he has a new DVD out which isn't quite as funny.",1264982400,,441,3.932584269662921

It was nice to know that I could watch this with my 12yr old son, and aside from one f-bomb, the rest was stuff we could BOTH laugh at, without it delving into raunchy humor. His sound effects are AMAZING, his voice changes are hysterical, and his material is a riot. I can't wait to find more dvd's of his!",1250553600,,422,3.976470588235294
2837712,4,B000QFAFNQ,"This DVD was worth every penny paid and more. I laughed all the way through. I think Gabriel has a gift for comedy. His jokes are personal and very witty. There are a few awkwardly told jokes and one punchline he literally has to explain to the audience, but I think he is still honing his craft and he's definitely worth watching now. I laughed my butt off all the way through the disc (but it grew back). I think his timing is really good for the most part and his facial expressions are priceless.

I saw him live last night (all new material - and as funny as ever), and woke up with a smile on my face and a sore throat from all the laughing, so I put the DVD on again to enjoy ""classic"" Gabriel. It's pretty clear from the reviews here that this guy is FUNNY. His audience is young, old, black, brown, white, male, female, gay, straight -whatever. You don't have to be a certain type or group to enjoy his storytelling and his crazy voices. And he keeps it clean, too. His humor is about life, not putting people down. He's going to become one of the all-time greats, and with this DVD you'll be able to say, ""I saw him way back when...""",1247875200,2,713,4.136690647482014

He doesn't take himself too seriously!

He covers topics of his heritage, eating, his neighbors, family and friends and does it with a unique twist of the realization of his 'size'. He is a big boy!

Hot and Fluffy! He makes you laugh out loud and it will make you feel good to know there are others who have the the same opinions about certain things - as you do.

The extras include a Q&A which really is just as funny as the concert. I would get this for the pure fun of it and it is a great price! 3-27-09",1238112000,,681,4.022222222222222

2837724,5,B000QFAFNQ,"It's hard now a days to find a comedian someone like me can truely relate to. Most of today's comedians don't talk about their lives ""before"" stardome. They speak of what it's like to be famous all the time and other irrelevent things to most of us ""country"" folk. Granted we country folk have jeff foxworthy, larry the cable guy, and bill engvall... BUT Gabriel touched us on a different level. He definitely spoke from real experience. He wasn't making up stuff trying to be funny, he simply re-worded his life experiences to entertain the world! He speaks of everything from dealing with the police to what it's like to be ""fluffy"". He does make one good point as well. Why eat healthy, exercise, and be bored while living forever; when you can party, eat what you want, and say you did something with your life. Eh, it was a good point to me anyway. Definitely a show the family can watch. Not so sure a child would understand what's going on, but there aren't any harsh words or anything like that. One of the funniest comedians I have fallen in love with over the years. He rates up in my TOP 5!",1232323200,,1101,4.428571428571429
2837725,1,B000QFAFNQ,I'm almost surprised by all the five star reviews here. But I guess it's just a matter of different senses of humor. Iglesias' jokes were tasteless and unfunny. They didn't appeal to me at all. The best reaction I had to this was a chuckle :\.,1230768000,2,243,4.304347826086956
2837726,5,B000QFAFNQ,This is by far one of the funniest stand ups I have ever seen!  Gabriel Iglesias is definitely one to keep an eye on.  He has a great routine;  does awesome impressions and sound effects; and pulls it off with lots of energy for a fluffy guy.,1230336000,,242,4.1063829787234045

From family to friends to being a big guy in a small world, his stories hit closer to home than many will admit, and his delivery, combined with his mastery of sound effects, make for a hysterical performance.

(That also goes for all four million of the big black guys who do the same tired schtick, borrowing and dumbing down jokes by really funny guys like Pryor and Eddie Murphy instead of coming up with their own unique takes like Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.)

But then, with my hand on the clicker, this dude went into an impression, and I stopped short. He's good, he's really good. Like the best impressionists (Murphy, Dana Carvey, etc.), he has that uncanny ability to make you see the person he's impersonating instead of this fat hispanic kid; when he does a redneck, he disappears and some douchebag cop pops up to talk to you. That's a talent when you're doing an impression of a celebrity (Eddie Murphy's Elvis and Desi Arnaz, for instance), but when he's doing some nobody, it's even harder.

And his schtick about the cop has one other shriekingly funny moment: the part about making love to Crispy Cremes. Very highly recommended.",1203552000,,1210,4.702830188679245

2837765,5,B000QFAFNQ,"Hubby and I had the pleasure of seeing him this month live.  We first saw him on Comedy Central a few years back and were hooked on his style.  He's very down to earth, has no problem making fun of his 'fluffines' and the sound effects and impressions he does throughout are wonderful.  Our show will be part of an upcoming audio CD so we can't wait for that to come out.

We'd gotten this DVD a few months before he came here after we'd seen his last Comedy Central Special. We were just cracking up so hard.  There's a Q&A bonus section and it's a great addition.  At our performance, there's  was also a Q&A section and we had a great time.  Listening to the stories, everyone will be dying of laughter. I can't add much more than what's already been said by everyone else.

If you've never seen Gabriel, you've got to check this DVD out.  If you're looking for a different kind of comedy, Gabriel's it.  I will say his act is cleaner than Carlos Mencia or George Lopez.  There are a few curse words here and there, but I'm not knocking the other two, as we love these guys too!

So when I heard ""hot and fluffy"" was coming out, I couldn't wait. I got this, went back to my dorm and popped it in. I was laughing so freakin' hard, I had to stop to keep myself from needing a change of pants. He is a very physical comedian, which is something you wouldn't think.

Where alot of comics seem to retread old bits *cough* Dane Cook biting Louis C.K...just an example; Gabriel has some fresh material, and his sound effects are half of what seals the deal.

2837770,5,B000QFAFNQ,"Gabriel Iglesias is overweight. If you've never seen him perform before it will be the first thing you notice. I showed this DVD to some friends of mine and when they first saw Gabriel come out on stage they couldn't believe how big he was. In fact, they focused on it so much I didn't think they were going to give him a chance. Well, less than 5 minutes in we were all laughing uncontrollably. You almost forget about his size even when his material is about his weight. His talent for comedy far outweighs his number of lbs.  When I watch standup comedy I look for three things. Materiel, storytelling, and sound effects. There are a lot of successful comedians out there and most only have one of these talents. Gabriel has great material, his storytelling is some of the best I've heard (especially when telling the stories about when he's dealing with the cops), and his sound effects are also top notch (love the police siren and motor vehicles). Heck he even does great impressions from presidents, to a state trooper from the south, to an elderly Korean woman. Bottom line is that it's a great DVD from a great standup comedian who will hopefully be doing comedy for many years to come.",1192752000,6,1195,4.558139534883721
