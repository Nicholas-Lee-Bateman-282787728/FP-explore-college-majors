8544941,4,B009XE9IK2,"I have all of Jennifer Cornbleet's books.  Her DVD ""Raw In A Rush"" is just that fast food.  Sometimes with many raw food authors it is scary how many steps and how long it takes to make raw food.  Jennifer Cornbleet understands we all work and have families.  This is raw food in a rush.  Whether you are raw or not this is an excellent DVD for fast healthy food.  I enjoy that simple fast recipes can taste so good.",1372636800,6,416,4.1375
8544942,5,B009XE9IK2,"I bought Jennifer's book Raw Food Made Easy for 1 or 2 People shortly after it came out in 2005. It changed my life to the point that I attended the Living Light Culinary Institute in 2007, where she was one of my instructors. When I learned that she had released a new video, Raw in a Rush, I bought a copy for a friend who was a ""newbie"" at the raw food lifestyle. My friend had such rave reviews for my gift that I decided to watch it myself, and I was surprised at how much I learned! In the video, Jenny demonstrates recipes from the revised and expanded Raw Food Made Easy book, but--more than that--she incorporates some really great, practical tips that even us old-timers can forget sometimes. The video is accompanied by a handy printed guide that covers such topics as how to set up your kitchen, what pantry staples to keep on hand and which brands of certain products the author recommends. The guide also contains printed copies of he recipes she demonstrates in the video, eliminating the need to ""take notes"" while viewing.

I will be purchasing additional copies of Raw in a Rush to use as gifts.",1365984000,8,1113,4.455882352941177
8544943,5,B009XE9IK2,"I've been trying to go the raw food route for several months now, but have found the majority of the recipes in raw food books complicated and requiring foods I've never heard of and had a hard time finding.  Jennifer's raw food DVD is the complete opposite of that.  Most of the recipes call for common, everyday fruits, veggies, and nuts that you can find at any grocery store.  Additionally, the recipes don't require a lot of equipment.  If you have a high powered blender, you'll be able to make most of them.  The exceptions would be the green juice, porridge, and a veggie noodle soup.  So the simplicity of the required ingredients and equipment makes this a great resource for the beginning raw foodist and gives veterans quick, easy meals to add to their collection.

The DVD is nicely chaptered and has three main sections:  Breakfast (has a green juice recipe, 3 smoothie recipes and 1 nut porridge recipe), Soups (3 kinds), and Salads and Dressings (1 salad and 4 dressing recipes).  The DVD also comes with a booklet with all the recipes for quick reference.  My goal is to try all the meals within the next few weeks.  So far I've tried the juice, a couple of the smoothies and the salad and they've all been excellent. Even my steak and potatoes roommate LOVED the chocolate green smoothie.  On most days, I'll have a smoothie in the morning, a salad for lunch, and a non-raw yet healthful dinner, and I've lost 5 pounds in a little over a week.  I'll also add that if you're into the principles of food combining touted by many raw food nutritionists, most of the recipes in this DVD will serve you well.  Overall, this is a really good resource that I'd recommend to anyone looking for uncomplicated, delicious raw food meal options.",1365811200,8,1751,4.606451612903226
8544944,5,B009XE9IK2,"I luve this book the recipes are simple
I love this book. The recipes are simple and delicious. It does not take me all day in the kitchen.  My husband is also doing some of the recipes and that is a first.  Every one who is just starting or already doing raw vegan dishes should buy this book..",1365379200,3,295,4.068965517241379
8544945,5,B009XE9IK2,"Essentially, SRP's review of Ms. Cornbleet's, ""Raw In A Rush: Easy Breakfasts, Soups, Salads, and Dressings (DVD)"" is misguided (at best), and the overall critique simply doesn't address relevant matters pertaining to the ""actual content"" presented in the DVD.  `Nuff said there!

Truthfully, Ms. Cornbleet's unique, exceptional and very simple approach in my opinion is the best presentation hands-down when it comes to preparing sensational, fulfilling, and extremely nutritious raw/live food recipes and meals.  Whether a raw/live food novice, (like myself), or a more experienced connoisseur, both will be delighted with these 15 easy to prepare recipes consisting of mouth-watering soups, scrumptious, satisfying, energizing green smoothies/juices, guilt-free creamy salad dressings, and a to-die-for porridge recipe, which is my all-time favorite!

Each recipe is presented in an easy, time-saving technique and also included you'll find great, informative tips designed to invigorate your body, nourish your soul, and rejuvenate your mind, . . . yeah, the recipes are that good, folks!  I'm quite certain that just as I did, you'll find this DVD to be very informative and beneficial in so many ways in helping your raw/live food journey and experience to be an everlasting one, enjoy!",1365292800,9,1292,5.605128205128205
8544946,5,B009XE9IK2,"If you are looking for an overview of how to bring healthy food into your life, this is a great resource.  Jenny is a maven of raw food.  Her written cookbooks are absolutely excellent, some of the best vegan cookbooks available.  This video is perfect if you prefer seeing how to make the food.  Jenny is clear and thorough.  You will see how quick and easy healthy eating can be.",1364947200,2,381,4.385714285714286
