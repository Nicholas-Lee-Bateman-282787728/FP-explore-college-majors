I remember clearing out a family Thanksgiving dinner thirty years ago by insisting we all watch Eating Raoul.  I must admit I cringed when I recently re-watched it, thinking of my poor parents running away at the first sign of nudity.  The 80s swingers are hilarious.

276224,4,6300247694,"Director Paul Bartel's good-natured black comedy surpasses the oeuvre of John Waters with engaging characters and genuine wit. ""Eating Raoul"" (1982) garners plenty of laughs due to the inspired teaming of Bartel and Mary Woronov, who make a classically offbeat screen couple. Seen today, the film's cultural satire deserved a more generous budget than $350,000, which Bartel managed to stretch for all its worth. Definitely not for all tastes, this art-house gem found a larger audience on cable television and home video.",1454976000,,522,5.378048780487805

EATING RAOUL: Paul and Mary Bland (Bartel and Woronov) don't fit into the ""psychopathic environment"" of Hollywood. They certainly don't fit into the Swingin' `70s. Paul's a retro kind of guy, a bow-tied wine snob; Mary's a lovely nurse continually accosted by horny morons. They live for their dream of opening a cozy little country restaurant. Just as they see that dream slipping away for lack of money, Paul accidentally kills a swinger attacking Mary. Turns out the perv has a walletful of cash--just like all those sex-crazed maniacs who don't deserve to live, Paul and Mary reason... So they set up a mom & pop S&M business, catering to rich degenerates. Mary lures them in; Paul pops `em with his frying pan and grabs the cash. Things are really cooking until charming Raoul (Beltran) stumbles across their scam and suggests a partnership: they get the cash; he gets the rest--including the bodies. But Raoul is an ambitious dude, and the body he really wants is live, hot--and Mary's. Only Paul stands in his way...

""What a world!"" Mary marvels about one of the wacky, kinky fantasies she's been forced to enact. What a world indeed, in which a warped and wicked satire on the Swinging Singles scene is even needed. What a world that could pull off a black comedy about murdering perverts, featuring blind nuns, sex shops and the amazing things you can do with a cheap piece of meat. What a world in which this low budget pre-cult comedy continues to be rediscovered and recommended. (If it doesn't have a large following, at least it has a long shelf life.) And what a world where the creator of the ""Bland enchilada"" discovers that you can indeed keep a good man down.",1421884800,,1938,4.630813953488372
276351,5,6300247694,"Ok, this isn't the best movie ever made.  But Paul and Mary make a great on-screen duo and I love the humor in this movie.  I haven't seen this movie in a couple of decades so was thrilled to see it available to stream.  A great dark comedy.",1418688000,,241,3.9791666666666665

Paul(Paul Bartel) and Mary(Mary Woronov) Bland dispatch their prey with a skillet with the exception of a hot tub full of swingers.  Bartel and Woronov continue the fruitful partnership that solidified itself with ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"".  Terrific bit by John Paragon as a sex shop owner.

Some of them overact but that adds to the overall theme of the film, which is overindulgence in all areas, consumerism, and avarice. It makes fun of just about everyone and is a very enjoyable film to watch. Especially a very young and extremely sexy Robert Beltran [Commander Chakotay - Star Trek Voyager - very sexy then too!] I would highly recommend this film, it was filmed on a very tight budget and the sets are limited but you can see it was done with a lot of dedication and effort from all involved.

276517,5,6300247694,"Paul Bartel has starred in many television shows and films.  While playing judge or doctor roles in television shows like ""L.A. Law"", ""Ally McBeal and ""Snoops"", he also starred in films such as ""European Vacation"", ""Escape from L.A."" and ""The Usual Suspects"".  But he is also known for his short films in the '60s such as ""The Secret Cinema"" and his '70s films ""Death Race 2000 and ""Cannonball!"".

While as an actor, the majority of his Hollywood roles were not a main character, sometimes in Hollywood, you need to create our own opportunities.  And sure enough Paul Bartel created the opportunity by directing the 1982 film ""Eating Raoul"" which he co-wrote with Richard Blackburn.

With an anything goes way of directing the film and because it was low-budget, actors having to adapt to the schedule.  ""Eating Raoul"" is a film that will be remembered for its characters.  Along with Bartel, starring in the film was Mary Woronov (""Death Race 2000, ""Warlock""), Robert Beltran (""Star Trek: Voyager"", ""Night of the Comet""), Susan Saiger, Buck Henry (""The Graduate"", ""Catch-22), Ed Begly Jr. (""St. Elsewhere"", ""Spinal Tap""), Allan Rich (""Amistad"", ""Serpico"") and Edie McClurg (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Natural Born Killers"").

A low-budget black comedy, ""Eating Raoul"" made over a million dollars in the box office and would inspire a stage musical production  via off-broadway in 1992 and played in London in 2000.

While this black comedy has received a cult following, the original DVD has been out of print since 2004.  But the Criterion Collection released ""Eating Raoul"" on Blu-ray and DVD.
Which man will end up with Mary?

VIDEO:

""Eating Raoul"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The Criterion Collection Blu-ray release overshadows the previous release with a more clearer and detailed picture.  There is no darkening, no softness or blurring which is great for an early '80s film.  I detected no artifacts or any problems during my viewing of ""Eating Raoul"".  If anything, I highly recommend upgrading to the Blu-ray release as the picture quality is clean and impressive over the older 2004 DVD.

According to the Criterion Collection, the digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on a DFT SCANITY film scanner from the original camera negative and was supervised by director of photography Gary Thieltges.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean while Image Systems DVNR was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Eating Raoul"" is presented in English LPCM 1.0 monaural.  Dialogue is crystal clear and I heard no negative audio problems during my viewing of the film.  According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35 mm magnetic tracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Eating Raoul"" is an entertaining black comedy that captivates you from beginning to end because of its cleverly written storyline, its satire on society incorporating fascinating characters and off-beat humor.

""Eating Raoul"" is definitely a film showcasing black comedy at its best and in someway, it's a film that still has its relevancy because it depicts despair, consumerism, capitalism with cynical humor.

Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov are amazing in this film.  Bartel known for his dry humor and Woronov with her anything goes style, both talents compliment each other on screen despite being complete opposites.  As Paul and Mary Bland, the Bland's are the traditional American couple.

A husband and wife that works hard to achieve the American dream of having their own business, a restaurant.  But despite Paul being knowledgeable about fine wine, he is unable to find a job that compliments his knowledge of being a wine connoisseur and we see how this man wants to help the average American choose the best wine, but a convenience store is probably not the best place.  Meanwhile, Mary is a nurse and nutritionist who may seem very sexless and traditional but she manages to be sexually appealing to many men.

One scene involves Mary trying to get a loan from the bank, yet she wears a dress that exposes her bra and panties.  She has this demeanor of a prude that objects to men's sexual desires towards women, but yet out of nowhere, she comes out wearing this outfit and is constantly approached by sleazy men who want to have sex with her.

The characters of Paul and Mary and their chemistry is so off-beat, you can't help be fascinated by their strong love and appreciation for each other.  For Mary, because Paul treats her like a woman and does not see her as an object of sexual desire, she loves him for that.  And for Paul, the fact that Mary loves him despite the fact that he keeps losing his job, they are in financial trouble but yet manages to have this positive attitude.  These two compliment each other, despite looking as if they are total opposites.

And as these two represent a traditional American couple, their life and the area is anything but.  The truth is that despite her being a nurse and despite Paul being a wine erudite, they are living in poverty.  And that is where I see the relevance to today's world and economy.  How many people have we seen who have had great jobs or are college educated but yet live in poverty and can't find a job.  The building where they live is host for sex parties and all around them are sleazy scums, but yet these sleazy scums tend to be quite wealthy and people of high position as well.  They are indulgent, having fun and enjoying the good life, while Paul and hardworking Mary have nothing to show for it.

But what happens when Raoul, the Latino and thief with ultimate machismo enters their lives.  He is the character that is quite fascinating as well as he brings the danger and sex component to the film.  The one person that you know, if left alone with Mary, can easily tear down her wall of celibacy.  Sure, in today's world, it may seem so bad that Mary had to succumb, but for this film, to see Mary succumb to Raoul, sets up a love triangle between Paul-Mary-Raoul. And you know that this film will end in a tragedy, but who will be the one dying?

As mentioned, the fascinating aspect of ""Eating Raoul"" is within its characters and comedy.  Paul and Mary are people who live such a ho-hum normal life, but when they partake in an immoral murder spree, the audience doesn't see these two as sadistic murderers.  They are too normal and not the violent type, but yet we know they are murderers.

The fact is that ""Eating Raoul"" is a fascinating satire because it is the only film that I know that can integrate rape, murder and cannibalism without being tasteless or blatantly immoral.  The film is so off-beat that I found it to be wonderful and original.

The dialogue is absolutely brilliant and its one of the most cleverly written black comedies ever created and to this day, I don't think it can ever be duplicated.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Eating Raoul"" looks amazing for an early '80s film in HD.  Considering that this was a very low-budget film, it looks better compared to some other big budget '80s films on Blu-ray.  No softness or that age '80s look.  The colors and detail are very good on Blu-ray and definitely looks natural and not dark like the older 2004 DVD.  And the Criterion Collection definitely made this a wonderful Paul Bartel release featuring two of his short films including ""The Secret Cinema"", plus archival interviews and a wonderful documentary titled ""Cooking Up Raoul"" and more.

Overall, ""Eating Raoul"" is a sinfully, entertaining, absurd, hilarious but very enjoyable black comedy from Paul Bartel.  A wonderful Blu-ray release from the Criterion Collection.  Recommended!",1354320000,,9480,4.972027972027972

There is an audio commentary by screenwriter Richard Blackburn, production designer Robert Schulenberg and editor Alan Toomayan. They point out that Bartel used a lot of friends from other films he had worked on in front of and behind the camera for Eating Raoul. The three men recall all kinds of filming anecdotes, laughing and joking with each other on this engaging track.

""The Secret Cinema"" is a short film Bartel made in 1966. It was shot in black and white and done like a silent film but with a laugh track. Bartel remade it in 1986 for Steven Spielberg's short-lived television series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazing-Stories-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JN8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazing Stories: The Complete First Season</a>. In addition, Schulenberg talks about it in a nine-minute audio interview.

""Naughty Nurse"" is another short film Bartel made in 1969. It focuses on the misadventures of a nurse who moonlights as a dominatrix.

""Cooking Up Raoul"" is a 24-minute retrospective documentary featuring Woronov, Beltran and McClurg recalling their experiences making Eating Raoul. Woronov talks about how she first met Bartel and how he got her a role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2000-Roger-Corman-s-Cult-Classics/dp/B0038SUBEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2000 (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)</a>&nbsp;(1975). Beltran does an amusing Bartel impression as he recounts how he was cast in the film. McClurg came from an improv comedy background and tells a funny story behind her scene in the film.

Also included is a 5-minute gag reel featuring the cast blowing lines and cracking each other up.

There is an archival interview with Bartel and Woronov done in 1982. They talk about what their film is about and what they learned from Corman. Bartel speaks eloquently about the Blands and the `50s dcor of their apartment among other topics.

276575,5,6300247694,"Anyone who missed a Paul Bartel film from the late '70's or '80's simply hasn't lived. You can't possibly critique true comedy nor even begin to touch the cult classics without knowing the distasteful works of either John Waters or Paul Bartel. Without doubt, Eating Raoul was one of the best comedies of it's time & still holds up very well almost 30 years later.

The Blands are not your average couple even though they have dreams of purchasing a building for their very own resataurant. We must get this out on the table first. They are also happily married but sleep in separate beds as neither subscribes to intimacy. How ironic it must be to live in an apartment building full of swingers who are constantly looking to have nothing more than a good time.

Unfortunately, their dreams of buying this building are nearly squandered as Mr. Bland has no career to speak of & Mrs. Bland makes a small living working as a nurse. Mr. Bland makes a failed attempt to sell 6 of his finest wine bottles in hopesof saving for the down payment but they are stolen by con artist. The Mrs. makes an earnest attempt at borrowing money from a local bank which turns disastrous on account of a very obnoxious swinger.

After Mary Bland is nearly assaulted by one of the swingers in their apartment, her husband accidentally kills the man by hitting him over the head with a frying pan. Discovering the dead body has hundreds of dollars in cash on his person, the two devise a diabolical plot to murder society's trashier lot assuming that all swingers are loaded with cash.

All goes fairly well until Raoul steps into the picture. Raoul is a handsome thief who makes his living doing anything underhanded & wants in on the Blands' plan. In fact, he has also devised a plan of his own to earn them an additional cut. What Mr. Bland doesn't know is Raoul also happens to be in love with Mary & will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.

Perhaps one of the funniest dark comedies ever made, Eating Raoul warrants repeated viewings. You will find yourself slapping your knees or laughing out loud each time you see it. Watch it with your open minded friends. Eating Raoul is a hoot!",1309219200,,2177,4.529262086513995

This famous cult classic was made in 1982 on a shoestring budget; the sound is tinny, the sets are cheap, and all the actors, while experienced, act like amateurs.

276673,4,6300247694,"Talk about cult classics! Paul Bartel's darkly hilarious ""Eating Raoul"" was the first cult film I ever saw, way back in the early 1980s when the miracle that is cable television arrived at the house. I sat in openmouthed wonder as the movie unfolded, barely believing my eyes were seeing the twisted hijinks floating by onscreen. It's largely due to ""Eating Raoul"" that I became a Mary Woronov fan, and I also learned to appreciate as well as seek out any films made by Paul Bartel. He's an interesting guy, a man that looks like one of your balding uncles or an out of shape next-door neighbor, but he has a warped sense of humor that fits in well with 1970s low budget cinema. Audiences probably know Bartel, if they know him at all, for several films he made for Roger Corman in the 1970s: ""Death Race 2000"" and ""Cannonball."" These two films couldn't be more different in subject matter and tone than ""Eating Raoul."" The two Corman films deal with car races, crashes, and bloody violence. ""Eating Raoul"" is subtler, funnier, and much darker. Sadly, Paul Bartel passed away a few years ago from complications arising from liver cancer. His loss robbed us of a unique humor, as well as any hope that he and Woronov would reprise their roles in a sequel to this film.

""Eating Raoul"" introduces us to two of the most boring individuals on the entire planet, Paul and Mary Bland. They dream of opening their very own restaurant, a dining establishment that will allow them to hobnob with society's elites. Heck, they consider themselves to be elites even though Paul has trouble holding down a job and Mary works as a nurse. After Paul loses his latest position as a clerk at a liquor store--a hilarious scene indeed--it seems as though the restaurant will never become a reality. They can't even get a bank loan since Mary brutally rebuffed the advances of loan officer Mr. Leach (Buck Henry). Then the two stumble upon an excellent way to make money. The apartment building the couple lives in is a place where residents continually throw wild parties that draw all sorts of immature people. One of them bursts into the Bland apartment and starts to make quite a fuss, so much so that Paul conks him on the head with a huge frying pan. The Blands feel horrible about the accidental killing until they find a huge wad of money in the guy's wallet. What if the couple lured strangers over to the apartment, killed them, and then robbed them of their money? That restaurant sure would become a reality much quicker, that's for sure.

But how will the Blands lure total strangers into their apartment without arousing suspicion? Well, it's rather easy when you live in Los Angeles. All you have to do is put an advertisement in a newspaper aimed at singles and the people beat down your door. Of course, the scheme requires Mary to dress up in some rather imaginative costumes and engage in highly charged dialogues with these clients, but all she has to do is keep the game going long enough for Paul to charge in and perform his magic with the frying pan. Mary and Paul get rid of all sorts of riffraff in this manner, including a hippie played by Ed Begley, Jr. The two even begin to believe they are doing society a favor by ridding it of such despicable human beings. Then a problem strolls in through the front door in the shape of a locksmith named Raoul (Robert Beltran). He quickly learns about the couple's seamy activities, but rather than turn them in he soon joins forces with them. Thanks to Raoul the Blands soon make a bit more money selling the clothing and the bodies of their victims. But Raoul has designs on Mary, and he also cheats the couple of their ill-gotten gains. At some point Paul and Mary must heal their relationship while simultaneously defending their treasure from the wily Raoul.

Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov provide ""Eating Raoul"" with its greatest strengths. Both of them play their characters so straight and on the level that it's hilarious to watch them take part in such extreme activities. ""Square"" is a word that doesn't do enough to describe these two; they wear matching pajamas to bed--single beds, that is. The film's funniest scenes occur near the end, when Paul and Mary attend a swank party hosted by a guy played by radio personality Don Steele. The double entendres fly fast and furious at this party until Paul and Mary can't stand it anymore. They dispatch the partygoers by tossing an electrical device into the hot tub, then sell off their cars and other valuables. As shocking as these scenes are, what is more shocking is seeing veteran character actress Edie McClurg turn up as an airhead engaged in a number of unusual peccadilloes. While I think parts of the film don't survive the test of time all that well, ""Eating Raoul"" is still such a darkly humorous film that the central themes easily overcome outdated clothing and set pieces. I wonder if there is a link between this film and the economic policies of recently elected Ronald Reagan?

The DVD version is horrible. While we get trailers for ""Big Shot's Funeral,"" ""Dark Crystal,"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" there are no other extras. Worse, the transfer is one of the worst I have seen on DVD. It looks like a compression problem, or a problem with the aspect ratio, wasn't fixed during the transfer.

276717,1,6300247694,"This long awaited DVD is an incredible disappointment.  The major problem that makes this unwatchable is that somehow this movie has been stretched horizontally to fit a widescreen TV.  The result makes everything look distorted.  I don't know what the original aspect ratio was but this presentation is an abomination.  I tried running it on my computer software to manually adjust the picture dimensions. The film does appear to be wider than the standard screen size but not the ratio as presented on this DVD.
And to top it off the print appears to be something of the VHS quality (i.e. poor) with color and resolution deficiences. There appears to be a gash in the screen as if the video was shot from a movie screen with a tear in the top middle.  The sound appears to have been mono that someone has doctored up by added fake stereo and reverb, then steering the dialog from side to side. Warning: Listening to this may cause sea sickness.
Sony should be sued for selling this junk.  I probably will  be returning my copy. One thing for sure: if you are unable to manually adjust the aspect ratio with a computer, do not buy this.

276719,4,6300247694,"The 1982 low-budget outr comedy EATING RAOUL from writer/director Paul Bartel, who also stars, is an outrageously funny satire that needles such diverse elements of American culture as the concept of The American Dream, high-society status symbols, overzealous capitalism, racial stereotyping, and sexually deviant subgroups.
Paul and Mary Bland (Bartel and Mary Woronov) are a conservative, happily married middle-class couple who share an interest in fine wine, good food, and sexual repression.  They also share entrepreneurial dreams of opening their own restaurant for epicures. Unfortunately, the Blands are flat broke.  Paul is an unemployed wine connoisseur, and Mary only makes a pittance working as a Nurse's Aide.  To make matters worse, the building they want to purchase for their restaurant has also caught the eye of another buyer, so if Paul and Mary don't raise the $20,000 down quickly, they'll watch their hopes and dreams turn to dust.
Things actually take a turn for the better one evening when a ""swinger"" mistakes their apartment for the location of a wife-swapping party and elbows his way inside.  Assuming that Paul and Mary are the party's hosts, the horny gent tries to put the make on Mary, and in a passionate, knee-jerk response, Paul beans the guy with a frying pan and kills him.  Examining the body, the two discover hundreds of dollars in cash.  Surmising that all swingers must carry large sums of money, Paul and Mary employ the personal ads to lure horny men to their apartment, after which they off 'em, take their money, then dispose of the bodies in their apartment building's communal trash compactor. Now their dream finally seems to be within their grasp.
Enter the titular Raoul (Robert Beltran, later a regular on TV's STAR TREK: VOYAGER).  A two-bit con artist and thief, Raoul stumbles upon the Blands' murder-for-money scheme and demands a piece of the action.  Oddly, he doesn't want any of the victims' money; he only wants the cadavers.  It seems he knows where he can sell 'em, and he makes so much from each sale, in fact, that he offers to share HIS earnings with the Blands.
At first, the arrangement with Raoul works well, and the Blands are pretty close to having that down payment.  But when Raoul decides that he also wants a share of MARY, it's up to Paul to devise a way to remove the small-time grifter from the picture without losing his wife or endangering their culinary aspirations.
Robert Beltran, in the eponymous role, marks his first major film appearance with EATING RAOUL.  Although his part is obviously a satirical caricature of Anglo misperceptions and misconceptions about Hispanic and Latin folks, Beltran creates a remarkable portrait of the sleazy, opportunistic Raoul and avoids delivering a mere parody.
Pretty, quirky Mary Woronov--once a favorite of artist/filmmaker Andy Warhol during the 1960s--is a pure delight in the role of Mary Bland.  She portrays Mary with just the right mix of restraint and flakiness, being very careful not to take the character too far over the top and risk losing audience sympathy.  While not curvaceous or large-bosomed like the stereotypical porn queen, Woronov has a subtle, natural sexuality that makes her few nude scenes in EATING RAOUL very sensuous and erotic.  Heterosexual male viewers have no problem understanding why all the men in the film desire Mary.
Writer/director Paul Bartel is perfect as the pitiful, lethargic pseudo-intellectual Paul Bland.  One would never expect a wimp like Paul Bland to murder somebody, not even in defense of his wife, which makes it all the funnier when Paul develops an indignant pugnacity and DOES start whacking the victims.  A talented comic thespian, Bartel pulls this all off with a straight face and avoids pushing it to the point of camp.
In addition to the wonderful performances of the three principals, there are also some notable cameo appearances.  Comedy writer Buck Henry--known to most viewers as a writer/co-creator of TV's classic sitcom GET SMART--appears as a slimy bank officer appropriately named Mr. Leech. Ed Begley, Jr., shows up as a wannabe hippie; improv great Edie McClurg can be seen hamming it up at a wife-swapping party; prolific character actor Allan Rich has a bit as a gent with a Nazi fetish; and director John Landis makes a very brief (and uncredited) appearance at a sex party.
Yes, EATING RAOUL jumps back and forth across the line that divides mainstream comedy from avant-garde satire, especially by the standards of the era in which it was originally released.  But it's difficult to dislike this sardonic, satirical, low-budget dark comedy.  In spite of the Blands' murderous exploitation of unwary members of the ""swinging"" subculture, viewers tend to identify with the couple and feel an inexplicable desire to see them realize their epicurial dream.  And this emotional ambivalence seems to make the film all the more humorous and enjoyable.  In a way, perhaps, it's even cathartic.
The Columbia/Tri-Star DVD release of this delightful satire is a bit disappointing.  Though offered in an anamorphic widescreen format, the digital transfer has many noticeable flaws.  There are a few times when the image warbles or shakes (especially perceptible on a sizable HDTV monitor), and throughout the movie there are spots where the image seems excessively blurry.  There are also numerous scratches, hairs, and filmic artifacts.  Considering that EATING RAOUL has attained the status of cult classic, the flick deserves a higher-quality DVD release.  Also, it would've been nice if the disc had included some bonus material, like maybe a commentary track featuring Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran.
The bottom line:  The film EATING RAOUL deserves 5 stars; the DVD treatment only 3.  The 4-star rating, then, is the average of the two.  Longtime fans of the flick will want a copy for their DVD collections, as the disc IS better than the previously released VHS versions.  But uninitiated viewers should wait for a higher-quality DVD release.",1082332800,,6046,5.108629441624365
276720,1,6300247694,"I have a dream. I have a dream that, one day, I will not have to sadly report that yet another DVD technican on crack has butchered a five-star movie. As much as I love Paul Bartel's ""Eating Raoul"", I have already returned my copy for a full refund, and here is why: Columbia/TriStar (a major film company who should know better) took a movie that was NOT shot in widescreen, and s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d the image without properly matting it. As a result, tall and leggy Mary Waranov looks about three feet tall (and just as wide) because of the horizontal compression. My fellow reviewer who timidly stated that there is a ""slight"" problem with the picture is being much too kind and forgiving. The movie is NOT WATCHABLE and this transfer is NOT ACCEPTABLE to anyone who has even an inkling about proper screen ratios. In case you think I'm the one on crack, I did an ""A/B"" comparison with my s-vhs full screen copy taped from cable, and it is far SUPERIOR to the DVD version! When are film studios going to get over this presumption that every film ever released has to be in ""widescreen"", even when it was not the director's oriignal intent (witness the DVD version of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining""-it is available in ""Full Screen"" only, because THERE ARE SOME FILMS THAT MORE ACCURATELY RETAIN THIER ORIGINAL ASPECT IN FULL SCREEN PRESENTATION!!) This is also a shameful insult to the memory of the late great Paul Bartel, whom I am sure would not have allowed this, had he still been alive to supervise the DVD transfer.

276761,5,6300247694,"Brilliant and twisted writer/director/actor Paul Bartel stepped on a rainbow several years ago; if nothing else, that means that the sequel for this film that he and Mary Woronov had been planning -- ""Bland Ambition"" -- will never happen.
Bartel worked for Roger Corman (and various Corman alumni like Alan Arkush) a lot -- directing ""Death Race 2000"", appearing in such films as ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"".  Corman was (in)famous for cheap but stylish exploitation films, but this film's concept and script were a bit too far out for even Corman -- and nobody else would touch the project either.
So Paul and Mary did the film on their own, raising money from all sorts of friends and relatives, buying odds and ends of surplus film stock from studios (which shows in uneven image quality and colour balance) and shooting on weekends with pick-up crews whenever they could afford to rent equipment (leading to credits like ""A Sister to the Director"" and ""Guest Electrician"").
It's a hilarious black comedy in which Paul and Mary Bland -- innocents adrift in 1980s Los Angeles -- realise that they can make enough money to open ""Paul & Mary's Country Kitchen"", their dream restaurant, by luring singers in with a promise of Mary's abundant charms and despatching them, collecting their money before disposing of the bodies.  (The weapon of choice is a cast-iron skillet, the use of which is signalled by a Warner Brothers-style ""Boing!"" sound effect.)
Then they find themselves involved with shady locksmith Raoul (Robert Beltran); he expands their operation by fencing their victims' cars and by disposing of the bodies through a friend who works for a dog food company. (Shades of ""The Corpse Grinders"".)
And he decides to move in on Mary.  Both Paul and Mary are finding their horizons widening (without realising it) as they ply their new trade, and the resulting triangle is hilarious (unfortunately, its resolution and the result of a ""Lady or the Tiger"" style climax are telegraphed, unlike other plot twists...).
Black comedy as dark as midnight, but not particularly offensive in execution -- most of the sex and violence is by implication, and even the language isn't *too* rude -- the ""f"" word does make a few appearances, but that's about it.
Interesting cameos in this film -- Buck Henry as a sleazy bank manager, Hamilton Camp as a con man and director John Landis in an uncredited appearance i haven't yet spotted, and a friend insists he spotted one of the Ramones in the hilarious porn-store scene.
Worth a look if your taste in comedy runs to the off-trail or black variety.
