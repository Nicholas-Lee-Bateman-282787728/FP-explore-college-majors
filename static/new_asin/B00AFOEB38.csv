8551021,5,B00AFOEB38,This dvd is great and well subtitled too.  There are some small errors with the subtitles but generally well translated.  The show lasts 2hrs 30mins and did not disappoint. Rain is at his best and thoroughly entertaining.  In fact the dvd is so enjoyable I have watched it a few times. There is a making of........which only lasts about 15mins. It doesn't show much but is okay for the extra.,1414022400,,392,4.571428571428571
