8342241,4,B001TP945M,"These two movies are very different. ""Killers From Space"" is a straight forward 50s science fiction movie that isn't going to scare you but will probably make you laugh. I love this movie because it's like something from a time capsule. I was a kid in the 50s so I'm a sucker for 50s kitch. Everything is very American with a heterosexual couple that sleep in twin beds, an office with a large picture of President Eisenhower and FBI agents diligently working to uncover the Truth. The movie reflects an America that was confident that even a billion bug-eyed ruthless aliens could be defeated by the intelligence of one smart American scientist with a slide rule and balls. And this guy is a hunk not a nerd. The movie is set in Soledad Flats, Nevada and stars Peter Graves. The special effects are a hoot.

May I say ""what a difference a decade makes!"" ""The Day of The Triffids"" starts out as as a very  proper British horror movie. Actually quite refined and quaint but not for long. A Triffid in an ornate glass house plant Conservatory very quickly starts developing a voracious appetite. Things get out of control to say the least and then there is a meteor light show going on around the globe. You'll soon find out how they're connected. The story jumps from England to France and then to Spain.  And there is a sub-plot of a couple stuck together alone in a lighthouse Their marriage is on the rocks. The light house is somewhere on the very remote coastline of an undisclosed place. The wife is getting very bored and not getting the attention from her husband that she wants and who can blame her. They have to wait a week the arrival of provisions which include a single bottle of booze that has to last the week until the next delivery. Another bottle would have made there scientific work a lot more pleasant in my opinion. They are good scientists, especially hubby. Oh yes there is even an orgy scene in France when escaped prisoners get loose.

The movie is really all over the place but then so are the Triffids. It's fun to watch and the Triffids are very hungry and very repulsive and always on the move. But you must not forget the couple in the light house. Special effects are more advanced but still relatively primitive in this 1963 movie. However, I thought the special effects were great anyway.",1362268800,,2322,4.547846889952153
