And then they threw together a movie with no story, nor script just to use Jimmy's junkyard for something.  Maybe Jimmy needed a tax write off.

3944631,4,B002KT5T3W,"If this was a Lifetime movie, as people mentioned, it is the best that I've seen (they make some stinkers). Hard to believe but both the woman and the girl, are very common results of the type of foster system we have. One never learned to even balance a checkbook, the other became a true psycho due to severe abuse by mother and desertion by father, and focused her hate on the people who had no idea she even existed. I don't give a 5 because it creeps me out not because it's not believable, but on the contrary, it is too much. I used to be a child psychologist who could not deal with it anymore, not because of the children, but the fact that they were product of a system that sets children to fail or die. If it were up to me I would fire everyone from the US Department of Health and Social Services who deals with children and the state agencies in most states that it supposedly supervises. There is no fixing it. If you want to see how it too often turns out, just watch the woman and the child in this movie. And read the newspaper articles related to the younger of the children, who can't protect themselves, while America allows it to continue.",1483315200,7,1161,4.257918552036199

3944692,2,B002KT5T3W,"Hesitation at criticizing a filmmaker's work is a good thing. Filmmaking will always encounter unexpected difficulties. The difficulties about this film become quite apparent early in its presentation. Its hard to be entertained by a film when so much about its story allows a viewer's sense of disbelief suspend his sense of disbelief.

A good filmmaker can anticipate the appearance of future obstacles when she understands the real world motives underlying a character's fictional actions. By that anticipation, an idea as to what can be done to eliminate story difficulties will facilitate a filmmaker's application of cinematic craft toward producing a final product, a story, adequately crafted. For some people, the art of cinema is demonstrated by the film's story. Artlessness, expressed with hesitation, is demonstrated by Hurt.

Hurt's general premise is a good idea: A woman with a strong character saves her children from destruction. Yet the film's story invites many another perspective reason for belief the story is about more than a woman doing her motherly duty.

One question does arise: Given what is known about what motivates the antagonist, supplied by her own admittance, does that information allow some viewers reason for believing her motivations make sense? One answer invites the question: How much background research was done during the screenwriting process? A standard rule of thumb for believable fiction requires the writer's obtaining a factual understanding about her fictional subject matter.

In this case, it has to be asked: Did the screenwriter of Hurt do her required homework? Does the film convey a truth that exceeds the presentation of varifiable -- or in other words, accepted, fact?

This story attempts to demonstrate an interesting premise, but the story is seriously flawed. This film does well to convey a filmmaker's failure at understadning her principal character, the antaganist.

If the intention behind the story's premise wants the viewer's thoughts focused on the mother's thriump over explicable obstecles, then the story achieves some success. Other than that, it can be wondered about the filmmaker whether or not she cared about her story during its process of creation.",1455840000,,2236,5.392550143266476

It is a pleasant surprise to see an actress from one of my favorite series; ""Medium."" Over the years we watched the family grow up, and Sofia Vassilieva evolve before our eyes as an actress and a woman who is self-assured.

She plays a sociopath in ""Hurt,"" and amazes as an actress. Melora Walters and Johanna Braddy play strong female characters who come out of hell by keeping their heads.

Many of these terror flicks show females to be weak and stupid, and I appreciate the strength and tenacity shown by all of them, even evil Sarah Parsons.",1448323200,2,692,5.571428571428571

3944773,1,B002KT5T3W,"Hurt (Barbara Stepansky, 2009)

I will start this review off on a positive note, since it is likely the only positive thing I will say until I have finished this review: I liked William Mapother (The Bedroom) better here than I ever have. Mapother, a cousin of Tom Cruise, is one of the reheaded-stepchild brigade of famous-guy relatives (think Clint Howard and Joe Estevez here, among others) who often get roped into crappy movies as name stars. Mapother has always struck me as the most talented of the bunch, though he rarely has both a role with enough meat on it and a script with enough bones to allow that talent to come out. He gets the former here, and enough of the latterMapother's role, as socially-challenged Darryl Coltrane, the reclusive king of an auto graveyard who offers to take in his recently-deceased brother's family while they get his estate in orderis the male lead here, and he gives it far more TLC, and gravity, than it deserves, having ended up in this ridiculous mess of a movie that may even be too predictable for a Lifetime Movie Channel thriller. (Actually, for all I know, it is and I missed that bit.)

Here's the bits that matter: Coltrane's sister-in-law Helen (Magnolia's Melora Walters), her son Conrad (Jackson Rathbone from the Twilight franchise), and her daughter Lenore (Easy A's Johanna E. Braddy) find themselves at a loss when Helen's husband is killed in a car accident. Darryl offers them a place to stay, but then a lawyer pops up with a curveball: said dead husband was in the process of getting the paperwork through to foster a youngster by the name of Sarah Parsons (My Sister's Keeper's Sofia Vassilieva). News to the entire family, and Helen is about to tell the lawyer to go soak his head, but she meets Sarah and takes a shine to the girl, so despite her better judgmentshe's barely able to provide for her own family until the estate is settledshe takes Sarah in. Cue the usual lots-of-teens-in-one-house tension, but there's something else going on here. Creepy stuff starts happening, but is it Darrylwho is not all that great at masking the fact that he's been carrying a torch for Helen for a lot of yearsor Sarah, who may be even more of a social misfit than Darryl?

The movie's ugly, glaring, eight-hundred-pound elephant of a weakness is all too obvious within the first five minutes of the movie: by that time, you will have probably figured out every twist in the tale, assuming you've seen any half-dozen random thrillers of this stripe. It doesn't help that the much-superior Orphan was released the same year, and the two share more than a possibly-malevolent foster child. But one of the reasons Mapother stands out in this movie is that its cast, none of whom are normally slouches, all seem to be phoning it in. Much of this can probably be put down to the woeful script turned in by Alison Lea Bingeman, a longtime TV screenwriter turning in her first feature. It shows; this is far more an episode of a bad Lifetime TV series than it is a serviceable thriller. Skip it; you're not missing anything save a good William Mapother performance, one I hope he duplicates in the future in a much more deserving film. *",1391558400,,3190,4.68270944741533

They soon take in an orphan named Sara (Sofia Vassilieva). Upon Sara's arrival, bad things start happening. Suspicion and paranoia build, until uneasiness turns into panic, chaos, and death. HURT moves rather slowly, using the time for character development and storyline. This is NOT a maniac-kills-everyone movie. The body count is low.

3944776,4,B002KT5T3W,"Hurt is one of those horror films that takes a while to get going but once it does, it's worth your time.  It's worth sitting through the generic character interactions that take place in the beginning.  Though truth be told, it's not as generic as other films.

This is because the storyline is about a demented foster girl that this family adopted, and they live in the middle of the desert with nobody else around.  When the storyline finally gets going, the movie leaves viewers guessing whether the girl is causing the assortment of problems or maybe there's a lunatic out there on the loose.  It's actually fairly well-written in the ""Who's causing the problems?"" department.  My only grip is that there was one line where the demented girl was sitting in her bedroom and gave it ALL away.  That line should have been removed.

At first the problems are minor and insignificant- a bird is lying dead on the kitchen table and the family points the blame at each other.  Then eventually, people begin to die.

Because so much storyline is devoted to the build-up between the family and the foster girl, you will definitely learn more about the story as it unfolds.  Actually a key piece to the storyline is executed brilliantly by the movies conclusion involving how the foster girls parents were killed, and it's surprising how well-written and compelling it is.

What I find totally makes this movie a winner is the final 30 minutes.  Not only are the deaths interesting and creative, but the foster girl totally nails her role and actually improves her acting skills by quite a bit once we get closer to the end.

Overall, worth watching.",1327708800,,1645,4.726315789473684
3944777,3,B002KT5T3W,"Yes, it's another movie about an adopted child (that no one wants for a good reason) who turns out to be a bit of a handful. The structure of the story is a bit different in that we have a displaced partial family temporarily staying with an Uncle in his wrecking yard in a desert that is just the right distance from civilization for strange things to happen. So the family tries to pull itself together without the father who had died earlier they also bring in an adoptee who acts as a provocateur in exposing each individual's issues. As the movie progresses you develop the sense that if anyone dies - who cares.

The acting by Sofia Vassilieva (the adopted little monster of course) stood out and seemed to carry the suspense as she played people against each other.
As far as the rest of the movie their was nothing special about the directing, editing, filming or script - not great, not bad. However, there were two problems: First, it's another of those movies where you wonder how the script writers and director ever make it through life if the dumb choices of the movie's actors is any reflection upon them. Second, the final 15 minutes or so was like watching a cliff diver's sterling entrance only to end up doing a belly flop at the end. Just a total disaster of an ending - a belly flop. It's as if the creativity was depleted by the time the finale approached, or they were running out of money.",1314748800,3,1413,4.455598455598456

3944779,4,B002KT5T3W,"This is a very good generic type of thriller. It is not as good as ""Shutter Island"" or even ""The Uninvited"", but is still worth a look if you are into thrillers. A man dies in an automobile accident. His wife, son and daughter go and live with dad's brother, in a desert ""auto recycling facility"" known as a junk yard. This is just temporary until the settlement check comes through... Mom is diabetic and has issues with her husband's death. The brother-in-law is a bit creepy and is in love with his dead brother's wife. The kids are somewhat normal, whatever that is for teenagers. Before he died, dad made arrangements to take in a child from an abused home. Mom, after meeting the child, agrees to continue with the foster care. The teenage girl has an instant dislike for the new girl, Sara, and Sara has an instant liking for the brother. There is the expected twist to the story, in fact it is hard to call it a twist, and there is also an unexpected twist, for which there were clues laid out.

The acting was good, plot and dialogue were also sound. No nudity, no real sex, and the F-bomb gets dropped a few times, most likely done to ensure an ""R"" rating as the swearing seemed a bit out of place.",1283472000,,1208,4.345132743362832

It certainly wasn't the worst movie ever, but I'd definitely say it isn't worth purchasing.  The acting was superb, however, save one...the little girl ended up getting a bit hammy toward the end.

The film wasn't very original and had little to no plot-twists, or at least none that I didn't see coming about 3 scenes ahead of their actual revelation.  The scene that disturbed me the most was when the brother (played by Jackson Rathbone) gets smashed by a large metal sculpture thingie...his sister comes to discover him still alive underneath the hulking thing and doesn't even make one attempt to free him but instead runs off to find her mom and battle it out with the weird little girl first, leaving poor Conrad to suffer with his crushed pelvis or whatever injury he might've had...that definitely disturbed me more than anything else in the movie.  I would've at least TRIED to free my brother, whether it be in vain or not.  Other than that, this movie was so tame and uneventful that I watched it with my children and never once had them cover their eyes.  They are ages 6 and 7, if that tells you anything.  And my 13 year-old niece thought it was a ""really good movie.""

MEDIUM's Sofia Vassilieva needs to watch THE BAD SEED or ORPHAN to see truly evil kids do it right.

3944794,2,B002KT5T3W,"""Hurt"" reminds me of the Lifetime Movie Network's movies with its predictable plot twists, less than credible acting, and melodramatic scenes. It stars Melora Walters (Wanda in Big Love) as a widow who finds herself facing financial difficulties after the untimely death of her husband. With two teenagers to support, she is forced to rely on the charity of her brother-in-law, a reclusive character who reluctantly takes the family in. Despite living on someone else's charity, the widow decides to abide by her dead husband's wishes to take in a foster child, an orphan (Sofia Vassilieva of Medium)who seems harmless enough, yet also harbors a dark secret. The widow's teenage daughter who is finding it hard to deal with their diminished circumstances, takes an instant dislike to the young orphan, and when things start to rapidly deteriorate, she begins to suspect all is not well with the youngster.

There are some aspects in this movie that don't make much sense - the widow is annoying in her helplessness. Yes, she has type 1 diabetes, but that doesn't mean she can't be productive - there appears to be no real sense of purpose in her life, wallowing in self-pity, and her efforts to find a job appear half-hearted at most. The same goes for the two teenage kids - they keep whining about not having money and having to put up with their creepy uncle, but neither of them (it being summer) attempt to find a job. The only creepy factor in this movie is the character of the orphan who after a while, appears to harbor a dark agenda of her own (in a twist which I actually figured out quite early on). ""Hurt"" is a been-there done that sort of psychological thriller (not horror) and worth a rental at best.",1267228800,10,1716,4.700996677740863

3944796,4,B002KT5T3W,"This suspense drama immediately puts itself a cut above the average by being set in an auto junkyard. While most psychological thrillers set their struggling young families either in impossibly luxurious, spacious homes - or else in old isolated farmhouses that the family moves to in order to ""get a new start"" - ""Hurt"" takes a different tack. Here a newly widowed mother and her children go back and join her brother-in-law in his ramshackle auto salvage business out on the desert.

This makes for a complex, realistic setting with lots of sharp edges and shadows. There is also a pack of wolves prowling the property, adding an extra fillip of menace.

It becomes clear that not all the gears in this reconstructed family are meshing quite right.  The brother-in-law broodingly takes refuge in restoring a Ford Fairlane in one of the sheds on the property. The young son takes refuge in welding old car parts together into works of modern art. The mother adds to this already unwieldy assemblage when she abides by her dead husband's wishes and brings home a young foster child, well-played by Sofia Vassilieva (who is known for her role as a daughter in the TV series ""Medium""). While an undertow of tension swells in the family at large, Vassilieva blithely jumps rope across the dusty yard, a picture of eerie innocence.

Anyone who likes searching through junkyards for parts - anyone who's into old car restoration - anyone who likes family dramas set in atmospheres of moodiness that devolve into murder - will probably find this movie worthwhile.",1262822400,17,1557,4.886363636363637
