2988453,5,B000WOSAWO,"I like the variety of having 5 different workouts by 5 different trainers. These strength routines aren't that hard but do work up a sweat and good toning. I also got the Star Trainers Abs & Aerobics so I like to pick one from each to do together (mixing them up) when I have that much time. And if I only have 20-30 minutes, then I can just pick one of these by itself.",1362096000,,370,4.013513513513513
2988454,5,B000WOSAWO,"I purchased this DVD because Kendall Hogan was in it. I was prepared to ignore all the other routines, but what a pleasant surprise this DVD turned out to be. The instructors are all engaging, the workouts doable and effective. You can do one routine for a quick workout or pile them up for a long more complete one. The variety keeps it interesting and I keep coming back, especially on those days when I cannot figure out what I want to workout to.",1352246400,,450,4.369047619047619
2988455,5,B000WOSAWO,"I workout daily with the majority of my workouts being done to fitness dvds...because of this I've collected quite a library of them so I have much to compare 'em to...Still, every now and again I add to the collection for new motivation. This one a recent addition when Amazon had a sale and I have to say, in spite of having over 100 fitness dvds, this is a new favorite.

It's rare to find such variety in one dvd so if you only want a small library to work out with..or even just a couple dvds I would most assuredly suggest this one because you get variety with it...5 different top trainers chosen from the exercise channel. That, to me, makes it like getting 5 different dvds in one. Or 5 personal trainers in your own home, depending upon how you view it! <grin>

But none of that matters unless it WORKS, right?

CALORIC BURN AND RESULTS: I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn. I mention this only so you'll know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than percieved exertion or results. The bodybugg (what you see on the arms of the Biggest Loser contestants) enables me to not only measure how many total calories are burned during a workout, but also how many calories are burned per minute. This gives me a great comparison with various exercise dvds...and this one hit the bullseye! Not surprisingly for something produced by an exercise channel, they slam more into one move so, while you don't feel like you are doing double the workout, you actually are. For example, during leg work you'll hold handweights...this brings in upper body toning...then you'll twist while doing the legwork...which is a standing ab workout. Then, interspersed inside the strength building, there is cardio to lift and keep your heart rate elevated. When this is combined with strength training, you not only have a higher caloric burn during the strength workout, but the toning builds muscle, revs the metabolism, and keeps the heart rate up long after you are done.  Because of this combo which allows for circuit training, you get more bang for your buck in both caloric burn and results.  You'll see the same science behind many of the Biggest Loser dvds as well for example if you are familiar with them.

For me, there's nothing better and I am always in search of good fitness dvds that combine an elevated heart rate with toning...less work for more results. Burn fat. Build muscle.

This, according to my bodybugg, rated high on caloric burn...not easy for a strength training dvd which typically is geared more to toning.

CUEING: This is always a big one for me because I've found that some instructors trip me up if they don't explain things well or shout out things when they seem halfway done with the moves. Each instructor here was clear and easy to follow and offered excellent cueing.

ENERGY: Very high energy with upbeat music. No boredom for me on this one.

SET: Very professional well lit gym setting and each instructor had a backup team. You'll see all shapes and sizes on the dvd which, for many, helps motivation.

MOVES: There are some original moves here you won't see on other fitness dvds which peaked my interest since I feel like I've ""been there, done that"" on many. Yes, you'll have the standard ones that have been shown to work the best like squats but you'll see new ones and new ways of doing things that add in both more muscle groups and good results.

INSTRUCTION: While a beginner may want to start with low weights and progress up, the instruction is clear enough for all levels. I use heavier weights than most probably would to challenge myself but you'll work every muscle from head to toe so grab the weights that are your level and advance upward to always reach better results as you improve. Because you will hit so many muscles, changing your resistance is all you need to allow this one to move with you regardless of your level.

NEGATIVES: Did we really need the severe plug for Propel water to be that obvious? This isn't about the fitness aspect but to hear ""we'll break for some Propel in a second"" and then mention it again then see all the team grab a Propel and obviously fake chat while you have your own ""Propel"" break is silly...but heck I guess if it pays for 5 instructors to be on one dvd I'll live with it...I'd suggest they make it less obvious next dvd that it's a plug by simply saying ""lets break for water"" and then just doing a close up on the Propel label. It kinda defeats the purpose this way. High cheeseball factor here.

CONCLUSION: I think this hit all points to make it a favorite dvd of mine...great variety, worked all muscles without doing ""just legs"" one day or ""just arms"" but offering complete strength and some cardio moves in each one for big circuit training results. Great instruction, great energy...highly recommend it.

ALTERNATIVES: If you like the toning and fat burning aspect of this dvd, you may also like Kathy Smith: Build Muscle Shrink Fat or Crunch: Total Resculpt dvd. The Biggest Loser dvds also offer circuit traning for higher caloric burn when strength training as well. Just to name a few competitors that work as well.",1256083200,22,5155,4.62472647702407
2988456,5,B000WOSAWO,"I love this whole series - abs, cardio, and strength. Each trainer has their own style and personality - a great way to add variety to your workout.  I highly recommend it for someone who is a beginner to intermediate level exerciser who enjoys doing workout videos at home.  The workouts are short - 20 minutes each, so when you add them with cardio and abs, you get a great full-body workout.",1218412800,3,394,4.458333333333333

I can choose my workout or trainer each time and don't get bored by doing the same thing over and over and over.  The workouts are accessible to any level of exerciser - just choose whichever weight is appropriate for you, or no weights at all if you are new to strength.  Overall, nice to get different routines and trainers' perspectives on one dvd.

I use this twice a week, and the cardio version twice a week.",1211155200,4,491,4.362637362637362

2988459,3,B000WOSAWO,"I purchased this video, because I saw that Gay Gasper is included, although I must say she gives a lackluster performance from what I am used to from her. All the instructors are good in their own right, however, this video does not thrill me as I was expecting.

If you are an advanced level exerciser, then I would NOT recommend this video. The instructors are knowledgeable and fun, however the quick segments, even taken back to back, do not, in my opinion, offer a challenging workout. Until the Violet Zaki segment I was thouroughly bored, as many of the same moves were redundant from the other trainer's workouts.

If you are in an advanced workout regime I would recommend Cathe Friedrich or maybe Kelley Coffey for cardio and Jari Love prehaps depending on your taste for strength.",1202860800,22,791,4.72463768115942

All the workouts are led by great professionals who cue really well and focus on different body parts.  Rob focuses more on lower body and Kendell is upper body.  It's the variety that I love.  It's great value for money and you don't get bored.  They all make you work, and know what they're doing.  They are all outgoing and guide you through the moves really well.
This is a terrific workout and I really am enjoying it.  I think I'm going to look at the other Star Trainer series of dvds, because if they are as good as this, then I'm going to be a very happy exerciser.",1198540800,13,830,4.372549019607843

I've done very workout on the DVD, all are pretty straight forward and can be as hard or as easy as you wish just by changing the amount of weights you use.  I'm an intermediate to advanced workout person and I find that while I do work up a sweat I usually have to add an additional 10 or 20 minute workout to this to get a decent calorie burn (I wear a HRM).  The workouts are just 20 minutes and that includes the completely unnecessary Propel water break so you aren't getting but around 18 minutes of real workout.  I like most of the instructors, I can do without Rob Glick, I'm not crazy about his dancy style.  Some of the instructors give you a little warmup and cooldown, some don't which really bugs me, since I do add on something else I do get a decent stretch after.
