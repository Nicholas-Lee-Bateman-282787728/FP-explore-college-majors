8439312,4,B004RV714G,"This documentary not only is covers pelicans that fly thousands of miles into Australia's deserts which do much better inland by having a healthy fish diet than the counterpart by the sea that consume processed foods and garbage, but more importantly how the ecosystem plays an important role not only in the life of pelicans but many other creatures of Australia's wild life.",1409097600,,376,4.984126984126984
8439313,5,B004RV714G,"If you're a pelican freak (like me) or love waterbirds -- or just a good nature story -- get this DVD.  Beautiful photography, well-produced, and the story of the pelicans that migrate every decade to the Australian Outback is remarkable -- leaving the question, ""How do the Pellies -know- that conditions are just right for a 1000-mile flight to the interior of the Outback??"" And the images of tens of thousands of large Aussie Pelicans all congregating in the Outback is just stunning.  Can't say enough good things, folks -- you won't be disappointed.

8439314,3,B004RV714G,"These pelicans have a wingspan of 8 feet.  They have the longest bills of any bird on the planet.  They can eat 4 pounds of fish each day.

Think of the title as an oxymoron.  The work asks why would a bird that lives near water voyage 1000s of miles in the dry, distant outback.  The work keeps you guessing about the answer, but it's easy to hypothesize the reason, really.

To a certain extent, I think this work is meant to be like ""The March of the Penguins,"" or to at least to capture that viewing market.  These pelicans share egg-warming duties.  However, the birds do not mate for life.  Further, the older child pelican often kills its younger, weaker sibling.

You see a few other Australian animales, like crocodiles, kangaroos, and dingoes.  However, I don't recall seeing any koala bears or platypuses.  I think the narrator was British.  In the least, he didn't sound all Crocodile Dundee like the animal researchers interviewed.",1309478400,,944,4.682926829268292
