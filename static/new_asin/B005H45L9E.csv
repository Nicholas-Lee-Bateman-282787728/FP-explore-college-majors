8472657,5,B005H45L9E,"Comforting program easing the fears about having cataract surgery. Patients who have gone through the surgery discuss their experiences, and calm the fears of those who are about to undergo the procedure.

Age is the most common cause of cataracts, although ailments like diabetes and the use of steroid drugs may contribute to cataracts, as well. A medical professional walks you through the whole cataract surgical procedure, and explains that having cataracts makes your pupils a brownish or white color, and that it is essential that you utilize surgical operations to correct your vision. There is no pain associated with this procedure, and the surgery is usually performed on a 'out-patient' basis, which means no hospital stay. Within an hour the surgery is over, and you are free to go home.

Nicely produced program about hip replacement with a panel of people who have had hip problems, surgery, or just want to know about hip replacement surgery. The causes of hip problems are explained in a very simple way, so that anyone can understand that osteoarthritis is the primary cause due to aging. When we age the cartilage surrounding the hip bone gets worn away or damaged. The medical display of actual hip and joint bones was fascinating.

A hip operation is not too painful, and the operation usually works very well the first time around without any further surgeries needed.

Interesting program - well put together. A must see for anyone interested in this medical condition or contemplating hip replacement surgery themselves.

Very well presented panel discussion of the problems of snoring - a typical problem for most people. The program discusses a wide range of different types of snoring - throat, sinus and sleep apnea. A medical professional diagnoses and offers solutions to the average lay-person on how these problems might be fixed medically.

Nicely put together program and quite educational. A must see for anyone interested in snoring and how to fix this annoying, and sometimes fatal problem. I highly recommend this program for those who are planning on entering the medical profession.",1379030400,,2122,5.118497109826589
