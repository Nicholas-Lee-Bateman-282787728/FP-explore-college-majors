4485542,5,B004W75BVU,"To start off, I'll say that while FMA is my favorite anime of all time and I doubt I'll find its equal (though Cowboy Bebop is a close 2nd) I wasn't too happy with the way it ended, Conqueror of Shamballa included. Both are awesome and I love them dearly but it was missing that spark that I was expecting from this godsend of an anime.

This, ladies and gentleman, is that spark.

FMA Brotherhood is the more manga adaptation of the series and seeks to end with a better taste in your mouth (that or the creators just gave in the groaners and whiners hahaha). In this part 5, everything that had built up in the story if you've been paying attention begins to converge and ready itself for the conclusion. Ed and Al saddle up for an epic battle with the man who is behind the Homunculi and the grand plot threatening Amestris and ultimately face the choice of getting their bodies back. Friends will be lost and gained and blood will ultimately be shed in this dramatic and most jaw-dropping ending to FMA Brotherhood.

Like I said before, I love the original series and movie and just as much I love this series too. Here's my interpretation: the original FMA was darker, more nail-biting, and had a certain aesthetic in it that made it stand out by itself. However, the thing that makes Brotherhood equal to the tier set by its predecessor is the fact that it ties up all the loose ends and the closure to it is just amazing and I speak for myself but I'm sure many agree that that is really what we wanted to happen with the series. These 2 things in mind, I think they complement each other quite nicely and form a certain equilibrium that by makes it one of the, if not the, greatest anime/manga out there. Hopefully all fans that are and will be can find something to enjoy from this. I hope I did my best to inspire someone to pick this up. Enjoy my fellow alchemists",1310083200,3,1875,4.351428571428571

4485544,5,B004W75BVU,"I know it's not out yet, but I've seen the series in it's entirety when it was streamed via FUNimation as it was coming out in Japan.

This, ladies and gents, is a series that's ABSOLUTELY not to be missed. I've followed the series from it's original series to Brotherhood and, though it pains me to say this, I love Brotherhood better. It's darker, longer, and more sinister with more plots and twists thrown at you than you can imagine, all the while doing everything they can to tug at your heartstrings and keep you mesmerized by everything you're seeing.

The main goal of the story draws to a great closure, with everything tying up nicely, along with a dramatic and action-paced ending you cannot miss!

Fullmetal Alchemist is my all time favorite anime series, and Brotherhood is the reason why.
Definitely not a series to me missed.",1306454400,7,841,4.668918918918919
4485545,5,B004W75BVU,"Part Five brings the FMA Brotherhood series to a dramatic close. With the stage set, all your favorite characters engage in an epic chess match, trying to outwit the mastermind behind an evil plot that threatens everyone. As the story races to a close, so do the numerous character arcs. The fight scenes in this last segment are intense and engrossing as each character decides how they can give their all to save their friends. sound a little vague? I'm trying not to spoil the fun. if you have watched up to this point, you will love this last installment.

The final enemy's grab for power and the scenes that compose it are a little crazy (more than a little hint of some Evangelion scenes mixed in to boot), but the way Ed and Al resolve their fate was both clever and moving.

By this point, the differences between the two series are more than apparent, but one thing i will say is that, where the first anime series has a more dramatic - and maybe more poetic - climax, Brotherhood ends in a more satisfying way. Across the board of fantastic characters, there are few loose strings left lying around. I love this series. if you like anime, and if you have been following the story, this last chapter is more than worth it.",1305590400,19,1232,4.471111111111111
4485546,5,B004W75BVU,"Ok, so to date the final volume of the Funimation release of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood part 5 has not been yet released, but the entire series finished airing in japan last year, so this is my review of the final chapter of the series.

Ok, I'm one of the rare few folks who started into watching FMA:Brotherhood without having seen the original series at all. To be honest, while I like some shounen series like DBZ, I do find the classic shounen anime cliches and tropes to get a little repetitive and when the original FMA series aired on US TV, I caught a few random eps and it seemed pretty good, but something about the show failed to hook me in. Fast foward to the present and I learned about the new remake series that came out in 2009 and thought 'whats the point?' and was intrigued at the premise that this series follows the manga series faithfully, which was reportedly a much better story than the original anime, which thru no fault of its own, had a very incomplete (barely the first quarter) manga story to work with. They stretched out what they had to work with into half a tv series then completed the rest with their own original storyline that concluded with an ending that runs hot or cold with fans.

Luckily, hearing about FMA:Bro late, the entire series was already aired and fansubbed but since the first 4 volumes were out commercially, I rented all the available discs released by Funimation and finished the rest of the series with what I could find elsewhere. And all I can say is:

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood probably ranks among my top 10 favorite anime series...of all time.

And that is saying something for someone who has been watching anime since the late 80s. Eventually I watched the original series afterwards which I found relatively dissapointing compared to this incredible successor.

Part 5 covers the final 12 eps of this 64 episode series and what can I say about this series.

You're looking at nonstop, exhausting action as the main villain Father, aka the original Homunculus, reveals his grand plan, which far outshadows anything that the frankly lame villain, Dante, from the original series could have ever dreamed up.  Basically you have our heroes Ed & Al, allied with all their friends from Amnestris, Xing, even the Ishbalans all banding together to deal with the last of the Homunculi while trying to stop Father from carrying out his plan that threatens the whole world, God, and all of reality itself.  All I can say is the finale climax approaches a scope that rivals the end of Evangelion itself and really reveals the genius of manga authors Arakawa's imagination and storytelling skill.

Without giving any spoilers as to how this incredible series ends, I can safely say that by the final episode of this new series, you have a definitive ending with full resolution of all plotlines and characters, unlike the the original series which required another movie to finish of the storyline with somewhat iffy results. You finally see the end of Ed and Alphonse quest the way that should have been written in the first place.  This last chapter will evoke every emotion out of the viewers leaving you drained, but ultimately satisfied.  Perfect end to a near perfect shounen series that elevates the entire genre and providing a VERY TOUGH act to follow.",1303516800,76,3328,4.760416666666667

4485560,5,B004W75BVU,"A friend lent me the rest of this series, but he hadn't bought this final set of discs because they had just been released around the same time. I was so hooked on the series (and the visual/audio quality of actual discs over streaming) that I ordered it on Amazon the night that I finished Part 4, in a dither that I had to wait a few DAYS to finish this amazing series.

It's a fine looking purchase, mine came with those quirky little collectors post cards and I would assume it still does. I even enjoyed the bloopers bit, and I normally bypass most of the extra features. I sure wish it was cheaper, as this is a fraction of the series (although easily some of the best episodes are here, in the smashing conclusion of one of the biggest anime franchises of my generation).

I'm still waiting for a reasonably priced set that includes EVERY episode, but what can you do. I'll enjoy having this one on my shelf for now, as I had to reluctantly return the other 4 parts!",1412380800,,973,4.311475409836065

4485587,5,B004W75BVU,"Let me just start by saying, I intially was not thrilled when they first annouced Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood back in 2009 I hadn't read the manga and was only familiar with the 2003 series and the movie. I was, however, aware of the differences that existed between the first series and the manga and that Brotherhood would stick more closely with the source material. I, like many others, initially renouced this series, I didn't want anything to take away my love for the first series which I remembered so fondly, so i actually avoided watching the first few episodes that aired, constantly thinking to myself,""there's no way i'll let this series get to me, nothing can surpass the original, end of story"". But like a moth to a flame, once I finally watched some episodes I was instanly hooked. I spaned the entire series while it aired online english subbed. I tried keeping my conservations of the original series like always not wanting to let this show get the better of me, but after about 40 episodes my will was finally broken. And by the time the show ended I was finally able to say to myself; without a doubt this was by far the best anime show i've ever had the pleasure to experience. Being a whole season longer than the first series I found myself more enthralled by these characters than I did the first go-around, the animation is by far the best quality out there, and the story kept me integrated all throughout. This box set in particular covers the last twelve episodes of the series, the package itself is really nothing special (save for the awesome coverart) just commentary as well as a few previews. Being a collector there was no way even with what little it has to offer other than the end of this magnificent series, that I would let this slip through my fingers.

4485590,5,B004W75BVU,"There are many things I'd love to say about this last box set. Unfortunately I can't because I don't want to spoil anything for people that haven't seen it.

This last set was a thrill ride from beginning to end. The last 12 episodes gripped my attention so effectively that I finished this in one night. During this last set, the story's climax starts, there are at least 4 different battles going on at the same time, and still has that staggering effect on your heartstrings.

The fight scenes are among the best I've seen in anime for quite some time. They are very fluid, and eye-popping at some points. You'll even find yourself looking for small details when they're fighting because of which hero and villian is fighting. Also, the story telling in this anime, if you've gotten this far, you'll know already that it grips your attention. It's got something for every audience: drama, a subtle love story, action, martial arts, stunning visuals, comedy, and lovable characters that you'll love and hate depending on whom your talking about. Your empathy will kick in for the characters at the end and I'm sure that, for some of you, you will need a box of tissues handy for those tender moments.

If you've followed the series up to boxset 4, buy box 5 immediately. Arakawa Hiromu, BONES, and Funimation do not disappoint. Also the extras on the 2nd DVD are so worth it. There are outtakes. I know what you're thinking: ""Anime outtakes? How does that happen?"" The voice actors are being silly and just add in lines that are situational or they just plain forgot their lines and just addlibbed. My sides hurt after watching this. (Warning for parents though: it's got some pretty strong language in it, just so you're aware.)

Have fun with this last part of the series, and keep on the lookout for the final part of the Fullmetal Saga: Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: The Sacred Star of Milos.",1331769600,3,1899,4.676646706586826
4485591,4,B004W75BVU,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Part Five is a two-disc set that contains the final twelve episodes of the series.  These final episodes are filled with many revelations, plot twists and turns that leave the viewer sitting on the edge of their seat waiting to find out what happens next.  I have to admit that I was a little worried about the story being stretched out and slowing down in order to cover twelve episodes.  However, I'm happy to say that all twelve episodes were needed to finish the story, and there's not a boring moment in this set.

There are no bonus features included on the first disc of this set.  However, there are six extras included on the second disc.  The first extra is a commentary for episode sixty-four (""Journey's End"").  The next feature is labeled as ""Outtakes.""  This feature opens with an introduction from the ADR director for the English dub, and he explains that this feature is comprised of actual dubbing errors and some humor from when the cast was goofing off in the studio.  He also gives a warning that there is some ""adult language"" included in this feature, which ends up running for about seven-and-a-half minutes.  Personally, I found this feature to be rather amusing.

Next is ""Textless Opening Song,"" which is a textless version of the opening credits that appears on this set.  Next is ""Textless Closing Song,"" which is a textless version of the main ending credits that appears on this set.  There is also ""Textless Closing Song #2,"" which is a textless version of the ending credits that appear at the end of the final episode of the series.  The final extra on the disc is trailers.

I overall found this to be a satisfying ending for the series, and I would recommend this release to anyone who is a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

What would be my surprise when I suggested to my wife to watch the first episode of the series with me(I had been telling her I had ordered it for the past two weeks) and she agreed. From then on, I was the one who had to limit our FMA sessions so we wouldn't watch the whole volumes in one sitting.

The strength and depth of the story combined with characters you end caring for is kind of unusual for this media. Of course, there is also comedy, action and excitement but this is truly a special series for me and now I can say for us.

Only a few have truly satisfying endings. This one does. It seems like every anime has to end on an epic battle. While this series ends on such a battle it is set up so well that the epicness seems well earned as opposed to tacked on. It also spends about twenty episodes on nothing but fighting. In case anyone has visions of Dragonball Z and the endless repetitive fights rest assured that it's nothing like that. The show has an advantage in that it has a great many secondary characters involved in the fighting. This is important for the end because it allows numerous fight scenes to happen at the same time. The Armstrongs vs. Sloth, Al vs. Pride, Mustang vs. Envy, the Briggs soldiers vs. Wrath, Mustang vs. Wrath, Scar vs. Wrath... Basically a lot of wrath. Each of these fights is important and gripping with the understanding that a defeat in only one of them could doom the entire group. They do very good making it convincing that entire armies and highly powerful men are utterly outmatched by only seven enemies. Maintaining tension and excitement over 20 episodes is no easy task and that they manage to pull it off convincingly is very impressive. There is only one minor misstep and that is in the reveal of the nature of human sacrifices, yet thinking about it I can think of no other way they could have dealt with it. All loose threads are tied up and the series ends on a somewhat hopeful yet uncertain note. The future is not clear and I would love to see more about where this world develops. At any rate the ending is satisfying and feels entirely appropriate for such an involved and intricate series. If I had a quibble it would be that the final episode (which takes place after the action and wraps everything up) doesn't handle itself as well as the manga.

That isn't so with FMA:B, in the original series the manga wasn't completed yet so they did what they could to bring the action to a close but the main villain Dante was rather dull where as now in brotherhood you have an almost omnipotent being Father who manipulates most of humanity and the series is ended in a very concise neat matter.

The item itself arrived right on time (the next day).  It was in perfect condition.  I'm very glad a friend told me to try watching the series.
The dubbing is excellently done in English.  I actually enjoy watching the subtitles in the opening and ending.  The subs switch from English to Romaji (Japanese words in English letters) for these, which makes learning the pronunciation easier for those learning to speak the language (ok, for nerds like me).

4485608,5,B004W75BVU,"I watched and finished the first anime series a few years ago, while Funimation was still putting out the DVDs and the movie was being released in Japan. Fullmetal Alchemist is the show that made me an anime fan. I was the sort that turned my nose-up at the idea of watching something animated, but boy did the first FMA series change my mind. But that story, although good, wasn't enough. I was disappointed with the film, and wanted more. So I began to read the manga. Arakawa's vision was breathtaking, and beyond anything the show had done for me.

If you are reading these reviews, then we should assume you've watched the first 4 parts, and certain things won't be spoilers. The fights going on between the main characters and the homunculi have reached an all time high. Several of them are dead, and few remain fighting. Father's plan is progressing fast, and the Promised Day has arrived. Part 4 is packed with action, and Part 5 lacks in none of that. It's a rollercoaster ride from the first episode to the finale. The ending is (as many have noted) much more satisfying, and if I may say so myself, I thought brought in a close even better than the final chapter of the manga. It's the same ending, but like all manga -> anime, the delivery is a little different.

The packaging is beautiful, and so is the cover art. If you open the box, be warned... there's a spoiler on the back of the second disc (the picture). If you don't want to look, close your eyes ;).

The ONLY disappointment I have is not with the show, but that Funimation did not release the little OVAs that the Japanese releases had. ""The Blind Alchemist,"" and I believe there are 3 others. They should have been little bonuses or Easter eggs on the releases. Hopefully Funimation plans to release a pack of them around then the other movie comes out (which by the way, is a ""filler"" story and NOT a continuation of this one, so no one is confused. Arakawa has finished her story).",1314316800,,1960,4.4692737430167595

This is a must watch for anime fans and I strongly recommended it to non-anime watchers. I showed this series to my friend who doesn't like anime that much but after each episode I kept hearing the same words, ""play the next episode!"" and before I knew it we had watched 6 episodes and it was midnight.

The characters we have come to love and hate finally clash, and we learn about the true objective of the homunculi.  Rather than discuss specific details, I will just say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the best told and developed stories from start to finish (despite being 64 episodes long).  The series has the right length and ended at the right moment.

Do not hesitate to buy Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Part 5 and the previous four parts.  It is a worth series that is quickly becoming a classic in my opinion.  Even if you are a fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist series, you will appreciate Brotherhood.

As a side note, I give props to the English VAs. Emotions really start running high in the final stretch of the story, and the cast gives some stellar performances here.

As far as the actual product goes, the video and sound quality of this Blu-ray is on par with previous releases. If you didn't have a problem with Parts 1 - 4, you won't have a problem here. Apparently the source material wasn't animated in full 1080p, which can be apparent in a few places, but regardless it's pretty solid-looking throughout. The same goes for the packaging: holofoil cardboard keepcase housing an eco-friendly BD case with two discs. Also comes with four more postcards (art cards?) to add to your collection. The inner artwork might spoil the ending for some viewers, so if you haven't seen it or read the manga, you might want to close your eyes when you pop the second disc out of the holder.

The episode count is only 12 this time, and there isn't much by way of extras: 1 commentary track and an outtakes reel. While I haven't listened to the commentary (they're really not my cup o' tea), I found the outtakes enjoyable. With a runtime of about 10 minutes (just an estimate there), it's more a case of the actors ad-libbing humorous lines rather than flubbing them up. There's some adult language that pops up here and there, and Mike McFarland gives the viewers a short warning about it in the introduction, but it's all in good fun.

This is a flipping-sweet conclusion to what has been an amazing series. I highly, HIGHLY recommend watching it, even to non-anime fans. Chances are, you won't be disappointed.",1312761600,11,1841,4.620795107033639

The animation is as smooth and rich as I had hoped for: Greed vs Wrath (and afterward), Sloth vs the Armstrongs, Mustang vs Envy, and  the ""Promised Day"" main battle are terrific, eye-popping visuals. Sound is much better than I expected.

On a side note, the Blu-rays are my first experience with the English dub. Better than expected, but doesn't pack the emotional punch of the original Japanese voice acting.

Filled with a great story, action packed fight scenes and characters that you truly connect with, Brotherhood is without a doubt the far superior anime compared to the first incarnation.

I cannot spoil the details about the story, but this is the climactic battle between the homonculis and the human, filled with twists and turns left and right. It's amazing how you can feel sympathy for animated people but every emotion they showed I felt and every word they said felt real and that is a sign of a very well done TV series whether it is real or animated. I advise every person to look into this series because it has everything you could possibly want in an anime; action, drama, comedy and real human affection.

4485623,5,B004W75BVU,"In Japan, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" (Hagane no Renkinjutushi) has been a popular long running anime and manga series created by mangaka Hiromu Arakawa. The original manga series was serialized in Square Enix's ""Shonen Gangan"" since 2001, while the 51-episode TV series created by BONES was shown on television in 2004 and was followed by a film to conclude the series.

The popularity of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" has led to many novels, OVA's, drama CD's, soundtracks and video games and a lot of these releases have been distributed in various countries and its popularity is a testament of how people have come to love the series which has won many awards in Japan including being voted for the #1 most popular anime series of all time.

Despite it's popularity, the series could have gone on longer but because the anime series was created when the manga was only several years old, the anime series only lasted 51-episodes and there were differences between what the director featured on the anime series and what Arakawa had in the manga.

So, in 2009, a new series titled ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" (Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Furumetaru Arukemisuto) was created by BONES and this time around, the series would follow the manga much more closely. Currently there are over 60 episodes that have aired in Japan and the series is still ongoing. Also, unlike the previous anime series, this series would be created in HD (540p). The first 13 episodes of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" would feature its first 13-episodes covering the first 26-episodes from the original anime series but from that point on, the series becomes a whole new storyline which features more characters and for the most part, something new and different for the viewers, especially fans of the original series.

To make sure that there is a difference between this series aside from the storyline differences compared to the original, the staff is different this time around as well as the character designs. The director for ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" would be Yasuhiro Irie (who worked on RahXephon"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Macross Plus"", ""Gunparade March""), series composition by Hiroshi Ohnogi (""Eureka Seven"", ""Area 88, ""Aquarion"", ""RahXephon"", ""RIN"", ""Skullman""), music by Akira Senju (""Red Garden"", ""Mobile Suit Victory Gundam"", ""Silent Service""), character designs by Hiroki Kanno (""Angelic Layer"", ""Eureka Seven"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""RahXephon"") and art design by Takeshi Satou (""Mobile Suit Gundam 00', ""Ghost Slayers Ayashi"", ""Please Twins!"").

And here we are with the final part 5 for ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" and what a wonderful conclusion to the series.

The Military vs. the Homunculus.  What will happen to the Elric brothers?  And what happens in the future?

All questions will be answered in this final, action-packed volume of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"".

VIDEO:

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Part Part Five"" is presented in 1080p HD 169 via a HD native source. It's important to note that although the conversion was made to 1080p, I've read that the actual Japanese original masters were created in 540p. With that being said, this is a TV series and one can't expect OVA or film quality but I manage to compare the DVD and Blu-ray version and the Blu-ray looks much more colorful, much more detailed and looked much better and more colorful than its DVD counterpart.

I did notice edge enhancement and I'm sure the conversion of a 540p source to 1080p possibly led to the jaggies that can be seen at times. Granted, I'm a bit picky when it comes to video quality but the fact that this is created by BONES (a busy anime production company) and the fact that this is not an OVA or film, for a TV series, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" looks very good. Granted, it's not uber-vibrant but there is a good amount of shading, detail, blacks are deep and overall, I felt the Blu-ray looked much better than its DVD counterpart.

AUDIO:

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Part Part Five"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and in Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. Overall, the 5.1 lossless soundtrack sounds very good and there is a good amount of surround usage and its much more immersive than its Japanese lossless counterpart. There is quite a bit of action in this second volume, plenty of battles are featured and many episodes that utilize the surround channels.

The Japanese lossless soundtrack is still good, especially if you have a receiver in which you can change the setting to stereo on all channels. I do prefer the Japanese lossless soundtrack in terms of acting especially during the more emotional moments in this second volume (which there are many). But I've watched the series in both Japanese and English and for the most part, both are well done and similar to ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""One Piece"", the English dub has caught my attention and this time around, I was watching many of the episodes in English. But both voice acting are well done.

Subtitles are in English.

NOTE: You can not use your audio button to switch from Japanese to English and vice versa while watching the series. You will need to press your guide button to switch to another audio. Also, you can not optionally remove English subtitles unless you choose the English lossless soundtrack. So, for those who want to watch the series in Japanese with no English subtitles may be disappointed by this.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Part Five"" comes with the following special features:

  EPISODE 64 Commentary - Audio commentary by Mike McFarland (ADR Director/Line Producer and voice of Havoc) and Maxi Whitehead (voice of Alfonse) and Vic Mignona (voice of Elric).
  Outtakes - (7:33) Outtakes by the English dub voice talents from the entire series (Note: there is profanity in the outtakes).
  Textless Opening and Closing Songs - The textless opening and two ending theme songs.
  Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The final episodes of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is finally here.

And what an explosive final volume it turned out to be!

If there were two words that came to mind after watching ""Part Five"" it would be the words ""Kick Ass"".  Because there is a lot off butt-kicking in this series.  You want to see Mustang go all out, oh..well, wait until you see the battle between Mustang vs. Envy.  And you can learn how his anger has to be tempered but also getting to see that caring side that he has towards Risa.

Another butt-kicking moment was to see Armstrong vs. Sloth but also seeing who else comes to the rescue to battle Sloth.  One of the coolest and also more hilarious moments of the series.

You get to see one of the coolest fighting moments in the series as Scar takes on Bradley.  And of course, it doesn't end there.  Every character gets into the action and the battles are pretty significant, bloody but also...as mentioned, ""Kick Ass"".

But most importantly, unlike the previous series, we do get a conclusion to what happens to Elric and Alfonse.  And for me, this is how Hiromu Arakawa ended it, had wanted it and I would take this ending over the original series anyday.  It was well-done, well-written and from beginning to end, I felt the series was much better executed.

As for the Blu-ray release, PQ and AQ is good and voice acting for both lossless soundtracks are well-done.  This time around, I found myself more comfortable listening to the English dub track and this is coming from a guy who prefers to watch anime in Japanese most of the time.  But both are well-acted and fans should not have a problem with either.  As for the special features, we get an audio commentary with English voice talent Maxi Whitehead (Al) and Vic Mignona (Elric) to discuss their feeling of working on the series and how they felt about the series vs. the original version.  And we also get a gag reel of all the outtakes during the making of the series.  Plus the usual trailers and textless opening and ending themes.

I was able to compare the DVD and the Blu-ray release of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" and the artistic backgrounds and its details are much better looking on Blu, the colors are more cleaner, sharper and more colorful on Blu and for the most part, for a TV series, I'm quite content with the PQ. I felt the black levels were good and again, for a TV Series released in 2009, the picture quality is good not great (it's not 1080p) and there is a hint of edge enhancement but it's still pretty good. And in this part four, you also get two audio commentary as well.

Overall, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" was fantastic from beginning to end.  But this final part V pretty much validated for me that I preferred this version over the original.  The story and battle sequences were intense but for the most part, I felt that ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" story-wise was very appealing, exciting and addictive.

I know there are some who are very hooked on the original that they didn't want to try ""Brotherhood"" but I highly recommend giving this series a try since this series, an adaptation of the manga series that is very faithful to Arakawa's work, unlike the previous series which creators had to come up with a different storyline because the manga was not completed at the time.

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" ends with part 5 and what a thrilling, pulse-pounding finale it came to be!  Action-packed, battles galore, the ending is much better than the previous series!  Highly recommended!",1312243200,4,9549,4.944270507201002
4485624,5,B004W75BVU,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood follows the original story from the manga. It is almost 10 times better than the other fullmetal series. The action is amazing. The Art work is breath taking. The computer affects add a very unique flavor to the anime that is unhear of in earlier series. The only downside is that this in one of those animes that you HAVE TO watch from the beginning or you won't understand what is going on. It is very mature in nature, such as bloody violence. But is almost kidish in the down time. This anime will make you think, keep you on the edge of your seat, and will give you a warm feeling of resolution in the end. I read the manga, watched the older series, and watch this series as it was coming out in Japanese. 5 stars out of 5 stars. You need to buy this show.",1311984000,3,794,4.264900662251655

Two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, have committed a grave mistake and paid for it dearly. Edward lost an arm and a leg, while Alphonse lost his whole body. Now, the two have set out in search of the Philosopher's Stone, even if it means joining the military. However, they are not the only ones seeking the stone.

In this set, Colonel Mustang finds out exactly who killed his friend, Hughes, which causes him to go on a pursuit of revenge. When Mustang regains his senses, the group heads beneath Central to prevent the demise of the nation of Amestris by a being who had done the same thing to the nation of Xerxes. Elsewhere, Greed and the Briggs soldiers are trying to keep control of Central HQ, but suffer major causalities against Fuherer Bradley. Finally, the final battle against Father takes place.

I pretty much liked it all. The death of Envy was interesting, but nothing compared to Pride's defeat. The characters all sounded good and unlike the last set, there were no references to past voices after an actor got replaced (only one actor was replaced anyway during the dubbing of this show). I also enjoyed how Roy was the one being lectured about revenge this time by Scar, instead of the latter being lectured by his own people. It shows how much Scar really learned from his mistakes, even though his hatred for Amestris never really disappear. Greed's demise was a bit sad, when he had finally become content with the friends he had gain. Last of all, I enjoyed the ending of this series way more than the original Full Metal Alchemist anime. In the latter, it did not seem like the Elric brothers learned anything, whereas Ed finally realizes that even with Alchemy, he is just a normal human and that he can accomplish things without it. The series had a very enjoyable end, as well as nice fights.

There is not much to say that is wrong with the product that was released by FUNimation. However, there is one thing that kind of annoys me, but that is mainly Bones Studio's fault. The end of FMAB should have been an hour long episode, just like the manga ended with only one chapter, instead of two. Not only is it because the ending of the manga is only one chapter, but the closing credits to episode 63 was something that would have worked better as the final ending of the show, instead of the picture montage we get in episode 64. Outside of that, my only other problem is something that has become a normality. The ending could have been better as an hour long episode, but the annoyance of it is not that big to take the series down too much, especially since it is Japan's fault.

Despite the fact that the final episodes should have been combined into an hour long special, the set is still a pretty good release and has a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, I recommend people watch the episodes on this set, as well as the series, no matter whether they are newcomers to the FMA franchise or long-time fans. The story has the most unique ideas of alchemy and the Philosopher's stone in almost any medium and the humor is pretty good.",1311638400,2,3177,4.545454545454546

I bought this bluray because I could not find the last episodes on iTunes nor legitimate streaming. I have made every effort to get this product legally. So I bought a physical disk, something I haven't done in a long time. I get almost everything digitally now. But now I remember why I don't get physical disks anymore. Ads that I can't fast-forward through. I already bought the disk and yet every time I want to watch it I have to watch the same ads. I will never buy another bluray disk again.
