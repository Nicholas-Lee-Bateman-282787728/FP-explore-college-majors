8138832,5,B000HDRB4I,"I received my product in a timely fashion and for the cheapest price. It works great and is in good condition for being used. Everywhere else it was going for $200 and higher,new, but I got it for $40 used, I couldn't be happier.",1335484800,,229,4.2272727272727275
8138833,4,B000HDRB4I,"This still reflected the strong writing and strong ensemble cast of the previous 3 seasons, but a slight decline is noticeable.  This series clearly had a difficult start on season 1, picked up well on season 2, really cooked on season three and had momentum to carry this season off well.  You can tell that they aren't sure where to take some story lines here and the last show seems to be a desparate attempt to regain momentum for season 5, unluckily a failed attempt.  This cast had real talent but the writers seemed to lose interest; perhaps why they left the show after this season.  A good laugh if you get it for the right price.",1261526400,,639,4.435897435897436

8138836,4,B000HDRB4I,This show will keep you in stitches and entertained for hours!  The fourth season is just as good as the three before it and it's a shame it had to be the last.  The DVD's are good and clear pictures and the extras are fun.,1174694400,,223,3.933333333333333
8138837,5,B000HDRB4I,"Season four is packed with all new episodes that aired during the season in the show's first year on the WB. I liked this box set the best out of the bunch. It's filled with commentary by the creators, writers, Griffin Frazen who played Jimmy, Brett Harrison who played Brad O'Keefe, and much  more! The episodes are awesome and full of comedy!
