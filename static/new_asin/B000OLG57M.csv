8185583,5,B000OLG57M,"Excellent resource if you want to learn solo technique and get ideas for solo phrases. Note that this is not for beginners. You should have one to two years experience under your belt before tackling this. One minor downside of the DVD: there are no explanations or breakdowns for the solos. So, you can listen to the solo over and over again but, if you can't pick up a phrase or handing by simply listening and looking, there is no additional help.

One thing I found useful was to rip the audio track off the DVD, convert to MP3, and then use a WinAmp plugin that can play at various speeds without changing pitch. This is useful if you want to pick up some of the more complex solo phrases.

I highly recommend this DVD if you are an advanced player and don't mind putting some effort into learning new solos.",1215216000,13,813,4.377483443708609
8185584,5,B000OLG57M,"Amazing how this DVD was done. I Love how you can separate out the individual players/parts to listen to and focus in on and how you can just listen/watch the Dununs and hear their music without djembes as well. There are so many options depending on where you are on the learning curve, or what you want to focus on with each rhythm. And just watching is a joy because they're having fun! This sits beside Mamady Keita's DVD series as my ""go to"" resource. I'm looking forward to another with new rhythms!",1214265600,,505,4.440860215053763
8185585,5,B000OLG57M,This is The One  The One!  So far the best DVD of African rhythms for djembe and duns produced (until these guys make their next one).  See and hear ensemble and individual parts of more common and distinctive pieces to have in your repertoire performed by 3 very accomplished percussionists.  Please notice that they smile and have fun playing!,1205366400,,345,4.796610169491525
8185586,5,B000OLG57M,"This DVD is a great learning tools for folks who have been playing West African djembe and/or dununs for a little while. Each drum is demonstrated individually, and then you can play along on your drum, switching to different parts. Parts can be viewed/played individually or in ensemble form. Covers a nice range of rhythms. A must-have for students of West African rhythms, together with Mamady Keita's three-volume DVD practice series, ""Guinee: Les Rhythmes Du Mandeng.""",1205366400,7,473,5.2368421052631575
8185587,5,B000OLG57M,This DVD is great! I really like the quality of both the audio and video. Many DVD's in this category are of poor quality...this is NOT. The features are fantastic and very educational. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in learning about the rhythms of Guinee' at any level.,1205193600,2,295,4.584905660377358
8185588,5,B000OLG57M,"Here you can really see the benefits of DVD.  Being able to watch and listen to each part is so helpful.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is interested in djembe.  Taylor's other DVD ""Remembering how to Drum"" is also very valuable.  Can't wait to see the next one!",1205193600,,274,4.313725490196078
8185589,5,B000OLG57M,"I didn't quite know what to expect with this, but was looking for a good practice disc. All the features, like turning on and off the different parts...is nothing short of amazing, and helpful too. You can easily go around the rhythms parts, or hear how they intertwine. Love that part. Highly recommended!",1205193600,3,306,4.7924528301886795
8185590,5,B000OLG57M,"This DVD is unlike anything else available. The audio features are very cool. I also highly recommend this other DVD ""Remembering How To Drum"" by Michael Taylor appropriate for all levels.
