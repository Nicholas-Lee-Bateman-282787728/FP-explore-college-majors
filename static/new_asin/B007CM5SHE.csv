8514608,5,B007CM5SHE,Neat DVD on Walt Disney's train stories.,1419465600,,40,4.857142857142857
8514609,5,B007CM5SHE,"This dvd has been remarkably created with some of the most renown Disneyland Steam Train enthusiast.
Also one will enjoy the vintage and rare sixty year old footage of Disneyland and Walt Disney. The quality of the vintage footage is
maybe not todays standards, yet nicely preserved for historians who love the history of our country. One who knows our history can understand the footage from our past wasn't the best technology & was still in its infancy. The history of our steam trains and along with the Disneyland Railroad are created with so much research and effort that anyone who loves history will enjoy",1409011200,,613,4.847619047619047
8514610,3,B007CM5SHE,"I bought it because I figured there would be video I'd never seen and that was true. But whoever did this production didn't do a terrible job but did leave some problems with editing. There are skipsan repeats, i.e. the scene where Walt is in the train cab and cooly points/shoots his finger in his enthusiasm during what seems to be a ceremonial start of one of the Disneyland Steam Trains is used to excess. The resolution of the scanned movie footage is mostly poor and terrible in several places. I'm not sorry I got it, it's surprisingly long too, but I just wish the quality was better. I AM glad it was made though, even with the quality issues.",1379980800,2,652,4.441666666666666
8514611,4,B007CM5SHE,"Very comprehensive look at the history of the Disney fascination with steam railroading...
Brought back memories of the 50's when Disneyland first opened and the trains were the main reason to go!!",1370822400,,197,5.1875
8514612,5,B007CM5SHE,"I am an Engineer on the Disneyland Railroad and I thought I knew a lot about the railroad. This DVD is well done,
full of great history and just plain fun. I would recommend it to all, but especially a must see for Disney rail fans.",1363478400,,232,4.065217391304348
