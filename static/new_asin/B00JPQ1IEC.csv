6388516,5,B00JPQ1IEC,"Fair warning to anyone purchasing this: the set I received replaced ""Street Fighter"" and ""Return of the Street Fighter"" with two other Sonny Chiba films - ""Legend of Eight Samurai"" and ""Ninja Wars"", even though the box says otherwise. I would recommend the Pop Flix Street Fighter Collection if you want those two. It's only $5, and probably the same quality transfer as what used to be in this set.",1418083200,3,399,4.714285714285714

6388519,5,B00JPQ1IEC,"I'm a huge martial arts fan.  And I enjoy the old, terrible acting and even worse dubbing.  But that's just me.  This is 2 sets of 50 movies, lots to choose from.  There are definitely some hidden gems.  Don't expect super high quality.  You do get what you pay for!",1408665600,3,266,4.22
6388520,4,B00JPQ1IEC,"This is actually a bundle of two Mill Creek collections, the newly released ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Fist-Frenzy-50-Movie-Collection/dp/B00JPQ1I6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Fist Frenzy - 50 Movie Collection</a>"", and the previously released ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martial-Arts-50-Movie-Pack-Collection-2005/dp/B0007DBJUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martial Arts 50 Movie Pack Collection (2005)</a>"". The films themselves have been reviewed ad nauseum, so I will focus primarily on the packaging. Each set is a brick pack with the DVDs in paper sleeves stacked one upon the other. Martial Arts 50 Pack is comprised of flippy discs containing two films per side, whereas Iron Fist Frenzy has single sided discs, but four films per DVD. Each set also comes with a booklet that gives the movie title, year, stars and a brief synopsis about the film. There's also an index in the back indicating what movie is on what disc.

Iron Fist Frenzy also includes the films from the new and previously released smaller collections: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flying-Fists-of-Kung-Fu-12-Movie-Set/dp/B00CMDPTJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flying Fists of Kung Fu - 12 Movie Set</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickin-It-Shaolin-Style-12-Movie-Set/dp/B00CMDPTM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickin' It Shaolin Style - 12 Movie Set</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Way-of-the-5-Finger-Death-Strike-12-Movie-Collection/dp/B00JPQ1IOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Way of the 5 Finger Death Strike - 12 Movie Collection</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Impersonators-12-Movie-Collection/dp/B00JPQ1IWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Impersonators - 12 Movie Collection</a>"". So if you have one or more of these collections already, and are looking to complete your collection of Mill Creek martial arts releases, you may want to opt to pick up the sets that you need rather that getting this one. You can check the individual listings for the titles that are included in each collection.

You get a lot of bang for the buck from this set, but you do get what you pay for. There's no remastering to be found. Yes, the quality isn't the greatest for these movies; they don't get the respect that they deserve. Many/most of the films are VHS rips, full screen with English dubs. No extras, just the movies. There are some gems in here, but a lot of chaff as well. If you're new into martial arts films, or have an interest in finding out more about them, I'm sure that you could do a lot worse. You may want to opt for one of the smaller sets to test the waters, and that's fine. If you're already a fan of martial arts films, you probably have most or all of these from previous collections. I don't regret the purchase, and having already viewed a few of the movies, I look forward to hours of viewing fun!",1403827200,29,3071,6.487804878048781

8652976,4,B00JPQ1IEC,"Yikes, make sure you shop around before you buy this for $200.  It's composed of the Iron Fist Frenzy 50 movie set and the Martial Arts 50 pack... each of which you can find for around $15, sometimes less.  So, a $30 value for $200?!?  Both sets are fine and have some good old-school kung fu movies in them, in transfers that will be acceptable for most people who have been watching these kind of movies for a while... but be careful of the price!",1449187200,2,449,4.258823529411765
