8717684,1,B00Y8BNPQS,I bought this for Get Over It and I find that it has NONE of the special features the DVD has. Now I can't give it as the gift I was planning to use it for. This fact should have been included in the product description.,1472256000,4,220,3.8043478260869565

8717688,5,B00Y8BNPQS,"Let me say that I have in the past seen The Battle for Shaker Heights and really liked it, I have seen Outside Providence and really liked it so I will be talking about the movie that I never did see.....Get Over It, and I loved it. No matter how you look at it, these 3 movies are all in the win column. Back to ""Get Over It"" Loved the intro, loved all the people in it and it was so very funny, I did a lot of laughing out loud. I even liked Kirsten Dunst in this, yep, OMG. The whole cast was superb, Ben Foster is outstanding and so are Sisqo, Shane West, Colin Hanks and everyone else. So funny. Poor Ben. You can feel his pain through the entire movie. Do I recommend this trio of films.....you betcha!",1449792000,2,708,4.028368794326241
