8437615,5,B00005AMCZ,"As a tank fan, I have several videos on the subject.  Most are amateurishly produced and light on facts.  This 3-tape set, however is great!
The set follows the evolution of tank design during WW2.  It is presented from the British perspective and gives excessive praise to their rather pedestrian tanks.  It includes an interview with a descendant of the famously hesitant British Field Marshal Montgomery.  In it he says that the reason for the American tank breakout from the beaches of Normandy was due to the fact that Montgomery graciously assigned the Americans an easier route and because he bravely sat on his beachhead to draw the Nazis away from the Americans.  What fatuous self-serving crap!  Leave it to a Montgomery to claim credit for an American victory and to try to make a virtue out of inaction.
My second minor objection stems from the almost complete omission of any information on the American Sherman tank.  Ok, its armor and armaments were already obsolete by the time it saw battle.  And its design was grossly inferior to the Russian T-34 and some of the later German tanks.  And it's true that a lot of British soldiers died when they took them into battle against superior German machines.  But they were dependable, easy to fix and there were SO MANY of them that most impartial experts believe that the Sherman was the tank that won The Second World War.
These minor objections aside, I found the tapes to be excellent sources of information.  There is a lot of archival film footage of tanks in action during WW2, excellent interviews with modern tank experts and fascinating video tours of tanks that have been preserved in museums.  If you can find this set, get it.  But you can't have mine.",1083715200,,1726,4.748322147651007
