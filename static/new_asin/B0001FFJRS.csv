8307586,2,B0001FFJRS,"This dvd says ""introduction"" to Bokken & Kobudo, but sadly it is not for the beginner. The sword movements are to over complicated and none of the basic footwork or wrist movements etc is properly explained. Not for the beginner, would suit someone with years of iaido practice behind them though.",1147651200,3,297,4.8431372549019605
