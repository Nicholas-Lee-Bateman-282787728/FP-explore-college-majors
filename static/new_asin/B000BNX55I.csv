8089545,5,B000BNX55I,This movie should prove to be a lesson for all that feel that they can have a quick fling and move on.  Good movie!,1395014400,,115,3.7916666666666665
8089546,2,B000BNX55I,"This film is an edited version of a softcore film called, Desire and Deception, which was released in 2001.  This re-release has all loved scenes edited out, except for one scene where it was important to show something, but it was blurred out.  This DVD production company seems to like to edit the movies and then release the edited content with a different name to cash in on a similar sounding movie title.

This movie is not a sexploitation thriller about someone being stalked.  In fact the woman on the cover is not in the film.  This story is about an unfaithful husband  being set up for murder, with no stalking involved at all.  This movie might have been a decent skin-flick but the heavy editing and the misleading changed movie title, it becomes an awful, mixed up mess of a film.  I will not buy any movies from this production company again.  The seller is alright though.",1369526400,3,888,4.569620253164557
8089547,2,B000BNX55I,This movie is not what I thought it would be.  I am sorry I bought it.  Will be more careful next time.,1362614400,,103,3.6363636363636362
