7925454,4,B00004WI4P,"I have to disagree with of the other reviews on this film. I've seen dozens of porn flicks since this one and kinda prefer a plot mixed in with the sex, this company-10%/gwood cooper so far seem to do that, eveyone else seems to be
a lttle more devoted to the sex.
This film involves Derek-a handsome ghost writer who falls in lust and soon in love with Billy, who doesn't reciprocate his feelings. Derek has one fantasy after another involving him, until... well, you'll have to see the movie to figure out the rest. This was my second 10percent movie I ever saw-and if you're familiar with their style you should enjoy this film, the acting isn't the best, but the charecters are well played. The final scene is very erousing and romantic thanks in part to the music, check it out!",1266883200,8,783,4.4825174825174825
7925455,1,B00004WI4P,"This is not a movie, it's porn. If you want a bad movie with bad acting, bad casting, bad music, bad everything and a story that could be told in 3 minutes then here it is. It's a hour long porn flick, so if that's what you want this is it.",1081814400,13,240,3.7254901960784315
