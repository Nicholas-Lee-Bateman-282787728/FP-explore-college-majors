8165682,5,B000M2DN7S,"This is a Really Good martial arts weapon video.  The kwan dao used is a weapons grade long-handled Spring and Autumn falchion, not one of those flimsy Wu Shu reproductions.  As a result,the movements are more deliberate and realistic than the flying helicopter spins and somersaults you see in Wu Shu competitions.(No offense to those guys, they are fantastic acrobats)
The complete form is shown, then Master Chen Zhenglei breaks it down into its seperate parts and demonstrates them.
One of the few complaints I have with this video, is that as it was produced by the Peoples Sports organization for native Chinese speakers, all the captions are in Chinese.  The movements of the form are given poetic names, I know from prior reading, but they are not translated into English.  Master Chen's credentials are given, and they are impressive, but no attemp is made to make him seem to be a superhuman.  The photography is excellent, the training scenes are shot outdoors in a parkland, and you feel as though you and your teacher are out exercising in the open air.
This is one of the best martial arts videos I have ever seen. I have been looking for a good kwan-dao video for a long time, and this fits just fine.  If I could find more videos by Master Chen, I would consider buying them.  If all martial arts videos were of this quality, I would be very happy.",1231891200,2,1364,4.634854771784233
