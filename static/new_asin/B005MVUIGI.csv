8479871,5,B005MVUIGI,I like Suzanne Andrews approach.  It is look for older folks seeking exercise.,1529107200,,78,5.0
8479872,4,B005MVUIGI,The exercises are good.  She's an interesting character talking about using her eye-ron as a weight.  I enjoy the exercises with the leg weights as well.  I use it and another bone building DVD so I have some variety.  They are the only two I've found that I've stuck with.,1473120000,2,273,4.4
8479873,1,B005MVUIGI,"This is one of the worst videos I have ever purchased.  She quickly moves onto a new exercise without even giving you a chance to get in the correct position.  Also, there are alot of squats which is hard on the joints.",1455235200,2,219,4.190476190476191
8479874,1,B005MVUIGI,Very unprofessional.  Does not flow.  Was unable to finish watching it even once.,1430956800,,81,5.153846153846154
8479875,3,B005MVUIGI,She talks way to much. I wish the whole DVD was exercising with less talking.  The taping is kind of bad as well. I will benefit from this work out by fast forwarding.,1369180800,4,167,4.0606060606060606
8479876,5,B005MVUIGI,"A DVD by my favorite Exercising Team, Functional Fitness & Leader, Suzanne Andrews.  I have several including balance, cardio & this one for bone building.  I listed the exercises & took it to my physical Therapist who said the exercises are doable for me - I have lumbar osteoporosis.  Exercises are clearly demonstrated in a professional, yet friendly way.  There are always 3 versions from sitting to vigorous if appropriate.  I also like the explanations of the specialty that the exercises are designed for - i.e. What is osteoporosis, why exercising is important - how it helps, any cautions regarding any of the exercises.  Again, easy to follow, friendly, no special equipment necessary & physically correct.",1368662400,7,716,5.129310344827586
8479877,5,B005MVUIGI,"Suzanne's Bone Builder video and fun and challenging.  I've been doing excercise videos for many years and have followed along to my share of many good ones and bad ones.  What's so good about this one is the three defined levels of difficulty clearly demonstrated from the beginning.  Suzanne is fun (and beautiful) to watch, she's extremely knowledgable about the benefits of excercise and the dangers of bone deterioration, and the program can be made more difficult simply by increasing the weight.  I highly recommend this video for anyone looking to strengthen their bone density while having some fun as well.",1323648000,7,616,5.069306930693069

She really understands people who want to be kind to their joints and I'm one of those people.  I love to be active, just not into overdoing it. Bone Builder gives you a good workout without overdoing it and I love Suzanne's uplifting attitude. The DVD goes at a gentle pace showing you how you can use stuff around the house as weights to help make your bones thicker. I started out doing the seated exercises, but now I can do all the standing exercises. If this is too easy for you you can use heavier dumbells, which is what I do now. I use 5 pound dumbells and 8 pound ankle weights and I feel like I got a good workout in just 25 minutes.  Not too much to take away my energy to get through the day.  I got this awhile ago and alternate it with her other DVD's. I've been doing long enough now to know how to do the exercises so I opt to do the bonus section where you can't hear the instruction just the really terrific music.  Also like how I just press (>) and I miss the introduction and the DVD goes right to the beginning of the workout. Don't need to listen to that anymore. On the other hand if you're young, in really great shape and/or like rock or hip hop music and want a hard sweat pounding workout, you probably won't like this DVD.  I'm over 50, heavier than I used to be and I prefer a more gentle paced instructor now who uses a plesant tone and that is how Suzanne teaches. Here's a preview for you to check out.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Functional-Fitness-Better-Balance-Workout-with-Suzanne-Andrews/dp/B005IWG5I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Functional Fitness: Better Balance Workout with Suzanne Andrews</a>",1323388800,15,2117,5.665615141955836
