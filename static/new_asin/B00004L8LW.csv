8296615,5,B00004L8LW,Volume 5 will delight you with a continuous stream of passenger trains of this glory era departing from St. Louis Union Station (now a hotel and shopping complex) through a final lonesome train stopping in West Palm Beach (which still sees four Amtrak trains daily).  Only criticism is the photography usually concentrates on front end power (steam and some diesel) rather than showing entire trains.  This probably is because of the short and expensive rolls of movie film available in those days.  The train sound effects while authentic sounding and probably from genuine train recordings are I believe for the most part edited on to silent films since very few amateur movie photographers had sound cameras (don't forget this is prior to videotape recording).  Today I can record moving pictures -- with sound -- on a computer disk in my tiny Kodak M341 digital camera.  Viva technology!,1281139200,,891,5.034013605442177
