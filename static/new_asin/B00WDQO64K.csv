The movie follows an old man who decides to go to college to fight atheism, and while he's at it he kicks everyone's ass at chess, running, and various other sports. He also thinks he kicks everyone's ass with his logic, but really he's leaving a lot of open ends with some subpar arguments, and making himself look stupid and like he thinks he's better than everyone else, and I'm pretty sure that wasn't the his intention when he wrote this movie. Yeah, if you watch this movie, keep in mind that the man who plays Gramps also wrote the story and is responsible for the script. Everything, or nearly everything everyone else says in the movie was written by him. Of course you're going to win arguments if you argue with yourself. Not only this, but he portrays the world as evil and set against Christianity. There's a scene of the first biology 101 class when the teacher starts by asking every creationist to stand up, then says something to effect of ""by the end of this course, no one still clings to this foolish superstition."" This is how Donald thinks the world is. In reality, nobody cares what you believe in, as long as you keep it to yourself (unless asked about it) and try to coexist, but Gramps does the opposite.

This movie doesn't tell a good story or leave you feeling anything except disappointed in yourself for wasting 102 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.",1498608000,2,1573,4.442906574394463
8712921,5,B00WDQO64K,Great family movie! This is a movie all young people should see before they go off these various schools and colleges and get brain washed with this evolution garbage.,1485475200,,167,4.793103448275862
8712922,1,B00WDQO64K,"This is a joke right?

How does this self-absorbed, self-praising piece of garbage exist?  If you know anything at all about science it's scenes that ""successfully argue against evolution"" will be painful, the sort of thing that makes your IQ feel like it's dropping or may cause an aneurysm.

I thought Narcissism was supposed to be a sin but this self-obsessed man seems to think he's a Messiah.  Also why?  Why is it popular to consider evolution to be anti-God?  God (theoretically) created so many wonderful and complex things.  Why couldn't he have deliberately brought about an evolving race?  Hell, we humans forced a sort of evolution when we took wolves and domesticated them into modern dog breeds.  Pugs were not created by nature, folks!  Why wouldn't God have created evolving beings?  There was a time when people thought that the Earth going around the sun was ""anti-God.""  Science and spirituality do NOT have to be at odds.  The two can and should co-exist as a quest for answers and that does not mean dismissing scientific evidence because it shakes your perceptions. It means embracing the new ripples in your reality and consider that maybe that's all part of the plan.",1482710400,4,1191,4.865671641791045
