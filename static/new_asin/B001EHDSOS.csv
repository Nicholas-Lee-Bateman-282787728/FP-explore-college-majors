3554368,5,B001EHDSOS,"Finally. Finally, we can get full Doug on DVD. Amazing.

This cartoon helped shape my childhood and it is still every bit as good today. It stands the test of time by being humorous and poignant to all ages.

I applaud Amazon.com for stepping up and delivering this for us. We need to support methods like these to get the classics back to us, because they surely won't play on TV much any more. And anyone who loves the old Nick, knows that it's not worth it's weight in static these days.

Here's to ""Aaah! Real Monsters"" and ""Rocko's Modern Life"" coming to DVD soon! ;)",1220313600,5,572,4.377358490566038

viewing at such ease. This show always stuck out because of the portrayal of characters with ""alien-like"" colors. No other teenage aimed
cartoon has tried this since, Doug was a cool kid with a cool pup named Pork chop...smile",1430956800,,369,4.78125

I don't mean the disney version either though it's not very bad but i like the nick version way better. Doug, rodger, patty mayonaise, skeeter, mr. dink, pork chop are are funny characters and i love the music by the beets.

One day while browsing the Prime shows for kids on our Wii app, we came across the seasons of Doug! We started playing them just for fun and sure enough our 2 year old likes them. She doesn't understand much of what is going on because she is little and Doug is more for tweens, but she thinks Porkchop is adorable. I think when she gets older she'll enjoy it more.

Thanks to Amazon, my husband and I have found a ton of shows and movies that we thought were gone forever that we can show our daughter. A lot of today's tv shows for kids are lacking in substance and values, so having some things we remember fondly from our past is great. This is yet another way we can bond as a family.",1392940800,,858,4.076923076923077

When Disney took it over it died.  Love the original Doug.",1389139200,,370,4.318840579710145

I have always loved Doug. 'twas one of my favorites shows as a child and I have always fancied animation, so to find a combo of nostalgia and influence was just the bee's knees. I truly enjoy the fact that you cannot find seasons of this show anywhere else. Amazon doesn't really advertise this so when I stumbled across it, I felt happy.

3554818,5,B001EHDSOS,"AN 11 YEAR OLD'S REVIEW:
-----------------------------
I used my Christmas gift cards to get the Doug DVDs. I am a HUGE fan of Doug. I recently got the discs by mail. The picture quality is GREAT! I think it is better than the original aired episode! The discs play with no gaps, stops, or errors. When I bought it I noticed it said it was on a DVD-R, but when I open the disc and flipped it over, it was not a burned disc. It was an actual DVD-ROM disc. So, it is also playable on my PC and gaming system.

Overall, I think the $32 spent was worth it.",1357516800,,552,4.0181818181818185

3554823,5,B001EHDSOS,I am completely satisfied with Dough Season 1! It brought back so many memories! Doug has to be one of the best cartoons Nick has to offer. It came in great condition and arrived in a few days after I purchased it.  I would definitely recommend it.,1343347200,,248,4.276595744680851
3554824,3,B001EHDSOS,"Doug is such a great show, and I was so excited to have access to all four seasons! I was prepared to buy them all, but I am finding Amazon Instant Video to be pretty disappointing. The video quality is POOR, even when it's not in full screen (!!), and you can't actually download any of your purchases unless you have a Kindle. I find that to be false advertising, it should be stated more clearly to what machines you can download these videos.

All that said, this is the only place online that you can find these shows, and I am thankful that Amazon has them, but I won't be purchasing the other seasons after all, not until some changes come around.

Doug the show: 5 stars.

Amazon Instant Video: 2 stars.",1342396800,2,711,4.330827067669173

problems with piracy,  but this is a totally idiotic thing to do since many people don't have a DVD player and rely on their computer
for all TV/VIDEO video viewing.  After fiddling with all three DVD's for a time and getting a cryptic folder with a red ""negative"" sign, I read
the fine print at the back of the package and it says: ""These discs are expected to play in DVD Video ""play-only"" devices and may not
play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives.""  Just know this before buying these DVD's

3554828,2,B001EHDSOS,"I bought this set as I loved this show when I was 20 years old.. As a lover of Classic animation this show is one of Nicks finest shows to date.. I love Mr Dink as he is one to get into some kind of a bind when he buys the latest or very expensive thing that may backfire on him.. Patti Mayonase and Roger Klotz are just some of Doug's pals on this show. I love all the stories that he talks about in his journal.. Quailman is a hero he draws and writes about when he has to figure out how to deal with Roger bothering Patti..

Art Nice BUT The quality of the discs and packaging is not as sturdy as it looks.. Both Season one's that I have arrived with a broken DVD holder and scratched Discs.. I took them fresh out of the wrapper and inspected the discs... The bottom of the discs looked like they had deep scratches in them... The Second Season one was in worse shape as the Center Disc holder Bottom bracket had snapped off thus making the case useless.. Disc 1 and 2 had scratches on it and I called Amazon right away and voiced my concerns...

For those who ordered these and other sets.. Check your discs for any deep scratches... I hope amazon works out the problem and maybe I can try again to get this and other shows if and when they look into how they make and send the packages..",1318809600,,1293,4.086614173228346

The Content is pretty much what you would expect it to be.
 The Video Quality is just as good as it was when it originally aired on Nick all those years ago.
The Sound Quality is more or less about the same.
The DVD menus are simple to understand and operate( either play all or choose the episode you which to view).
There are no special features on this DVD set.

Lastly, since this DVD set is in DVD-R format, your dvds might NOT play in your dvd player!
Double check that before you purchase this product!

So, all in all, a very simple DVD package for all the ""Doug"" fans out there!

Enjoy!",1276300800,,683,4.143939393939394

My only complaint is that the last two seasons of this show aren't available yet. What's the point in only releasing the first two, why stop there? I'm sure these are selling very well, why would Amazon not take this opportunity to make more money.

When they made Doug into Disney, I got mad and refused to watch it. It wasn't the same as the originals on Nickelodeon. When I saw this 3-disc set on a website I was unsure of, came here to Amazon and found it quickly, and also more cheaper.

I am relieved to have found Doug Season 1. I was escatic with joy for over 20 minutes. That's also because I saw that they were releasing many other 90's favorites like Rugrats and Hey Arnold. I am overjoyed to be watching this right now! Doug was one of my favorite cartoons growing up, and now, over ten years later, I am so happy to watch it again!

The DVD's work great on my PS2. Haven't tried it on an actual DVD player, but it seems to play perfect on game consoles (as I have also read in several reviews). The shipment wasn't bad at all and I love how Amazon lets you track your shipment and keeps you updated. Thanks Amazon for making this wonderful 90's classic available to us!

3554861,4,B001EHDSOS,"To start off, it is great to finally have Doug on DVD.  It is one of my favorite cartoons from my childhood.  It is a nice piece of nostalgia to finally have.

As for the DVD itself, I have to admit I was nervous about the quality upon reading other reviews.  However, I have had none of the other problems reported by others.  The DVD plays on my computer and DVD player.  My advice is to make sure whatever player you have is compatible with the DVD-R format.  Most computers and newer DVD players should be compatible.  It may be seem costly to have to purchase a whole new DVD player, at least they have become much cheaper since the explosion of Blu-ray.

The picture and sound quality was comparable to what you would see on t.v. The only complaint I have is the lack of features.  The disks only contain episodes, no extras at all.  Also, it has the intro only once on each disk. If you are a big fan of Doug and you can live without extreas, then I would recommend this product.",1238284800,3,986,4.247311827956989
3554862,5,B001EHDSOS,"Doug used to be one of my favorite shows when I was younger, and I was disappointed when it stopped showing on the air. Luckily it was released on DVD!

I thought it was a little odd that they come on DVD-Rs, but they play perfectly, so I have no complaints. I believe this is simply because Amazon burns them on demand, rather than having a warehouse full of unpurchased copies.

I've read a couple reviews that hate the menus, and I don't understand why. It is very simple: There is a ""Play All"" option, and just below that there is an ""Episodes"" option. If you select Episodes, you get a list of all the episodes on the disc with a little thumbnail from that episode next to each selection, and you can pick which one you want. Perfect.

I've also read a review or two that stated that they have problems playing the disc in their player. This will most likely only happen if you have an extremely old or cheap player that does not support DVD-R playback. It is INCREDIBLY rare to find a DVD player that lacks DVD-R support, so don't worry!

Overall, Doug is a great purchase for any old Nickelodeon fan. It includes a ton of episodes on the three discs. The quality is exactly the same as each episode was recorded in, so no one can complain that the quality is poor. In my opinion, it's perfect.",1237248000,6,1300,4.337448559670782

Half the time I have to restart my DVD player over and over again to be able to select the ""Play All"" feature because I know the episode selection never works. If you're a hardcore Nickelodeon freak from back in the day like I am, it'll be worth your money, just beware.",1237161600,13,492,4.3478260869565215

However, be careful when purchasing this. The discs are DVD-R and it would not play in my Blu-Ray player. It got to the menu, but everytime I would hit play or try to do a chapter search, it would just reset the menu. Luckily, I still have my old DVD player that I'm now forced to keep because I can only watch it on that.

My Blu-Ray player is compatible with DVD-R, so the fact that this won't play completely stumps me. Make sure your Blu-Ray player is DVD-R compatible before purchasing.

3554881,5,B001EHDSOS,"In this day and age, TV shows from television's yesteryears are becoming more commonplace daily.  I never thought of the day that Doug would ever be released on DVD.

For those of you who doesn't remember, don't want to remember or just too young to remember, Doug was one of the first original Nicktoons (along with Rugrats and The Ren and Stimpy Show) distributed by Nickelodeon during its famed ""Golden Age"" in 1991.

It was created by cartoonist Jim Jinkins, a Nickelodeon alum from another Nick show, Pinwheel.  It follows the adventures of Douglas Yancey Funnie, an imaginative 11-year-old who moves with his family from Bloatsburg to the city of Bluffington, gaining new friends (and enemies) along the way.

Though a lot of fans will probably disagree with me, the show somehow shows a lot of racial diversity through an array of everyday characters, like Doug's family (his mom, dad and older, quirky sister Judy), his pet dog, Porkchop, his zany friend, Skeeter Valentine, and his neighbors, the Dinks.  How can we forget about his enemies (school bully Roger Klotz and his gang) and the school's assistant principal, Lamarr Bone?  Well, we can't because they help to make Doug's new Bluffington life more interesting (and complex).  The thing that tripped me out was one of Doug's main motivation:  romancing the heart of his secret crush, the lovely Patty Mayonnaise.

What would Doug be without his alter egos: school evader Jack Bandit, the superheroics of Quailman and Quaildog, and the adventures of the suave and debonair secret agent, Smash Adams?  Answer:  they would be boring if not for these.

The unforgettable melody of the show's theme songs helps to round out the song.  Plus, for its first time out of the gate, the animation was on point.  It's all good when both Amazon.com and Nickelodeon came to a deal to finally release this and many more of Nick's classic shows on DVD.  Though I was disappointed about no special features included, it didn't matter much to me because I can finally own it on DVD format.

Keep it up, Amazon.com!  Bring out Season 3!  Rock on!",1230768000,,2094,4.847887323943662

But Doug was hands down my fav and I promised myself if I EVER found it on DVD I'd buy it no questions asked. I knew Nick was doing the rewind collection so you better believe when I saw Pete and Pete winking at me at my locial bestbuy I snatched it up realllll quick.
But I did research on wikipedia about the rewind collection and it said that they pretty much said ""F it"" to the rewind collection....aka not important to satisy the love for the oldschool nick fans.
Every chance I had I'd look up Doug on DVD sooo I was super suprised to see not just season 1 but season 2 also!
I ordered them both without thinking twice(staying true to my promise to myself)
Within less then a week I had my copy of season 1. Although I was excited I also had a sinking feeling it MAY not be as good as I hope.

3554903,4,B001EHDSOS,"Introduction (Taken from the DVD set):

Tune in to this classic show featuring Doug and his pals Skeeter, Patti, Roger and Beebe. They dance, they camp, they doodle, they play, and they...blow up the science room? It's one wild adventure after another with Doug and all his pals.

Memorable Episodes:

As someone who has seen the show during its original run, it's really tough to pick out just a few memorable episodes...each episode holds a special place for me! There are a few obvious ones, though, and I'll go over those. In the premiere episode ""Doug Bags A Neematoad"", Doug and his family move to Bluffington, and worries that he won't make any friends there. He experiences the good...and the bad, but in the end, it's all one big learning experience.

In ""Doug Gets Busted"", as described in the introduction, Doug creates a volcano for a science experiment, and when a rumor is spread that it caused the lab to explode, Doug becomes ""Jack Bandit"" to run away from possible trouble.

In ""Doug Rocks"", Doug and Skeeter get a chance to see The Beets live, but Skeeter gets grounded. Doug wants to go, but decides to stick with his best friend. They get a nice surprise in the end, on their visit to the Honker Burger.

In ""Doug Is Quailman"", Doug begins to doodle his favorite cartoon superhero, Quailman, and imagines himself as the title hero, in his own adventures.

Packaging:

The packaging is a very standard Amaray-style case, which holds the three discs. The case actually feels quite sturdy, and the discs do not overlap each other. The artwork is simple, and it gets the job done. The discs themselves are printed on a nice, glossy, and high quality label, which gives it a professional look and feel to it. Episodes are all listed on the back of the case, without descriptions.

Menu:

The menus are very simple..almost too simple. They don't really look professionally done. I'm sure anyone could pull off a better menu using Nero. Main menu gives you the options of Play All or Episode Selection.

Video/Audio Quality:

If you're familiar with Doug during its original airings, or even the reruns on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons Network, you're probably familiar with the quality of the show. Pretty much the norm of Nickelodeon shows (and Nicktoons), they resemble that of VHS quality. Honestly, I don't think any cleaning up was done to these episodes, but don't get too worried, cause there's probably not much that could be done to the episodes anyway. Video isn't too consistent, plenty of color changes at random, a bit dull and not too bright in the color department...but hey, that's just reviewing the original source. Some episodes do look fairly sharp. I didn't notice any visible compression on any of the episodes. Audio is in 2.0 stereo, as originally aired, and pretty much makes use of both channels well enough. Dialogue is clear and volume is consistent. I didn't notice any problems with the audio at all.

As for episode lengths, despite it being a Paramount property, it's being released through Amazon's Burn-On-Demand feature, courtesy of CreateSpace, so don't worry about any ""Some episodes may be edited..."" nonsense that is typical of CBS Paramount releases. If you want to see consistency, the lengths are very consistent, depending of course. Take note, though, not all episodes have the intro intact, but I guess that has to do with the DVDs each being one long feature, broken down by chapter. I'm not a fan of this at all, but I guess the intro is there in some form, at least. You'll notice that the episodes with the intro are maybe a second or two apart, and the episodes without the intro are also a second or two apart from each other. Ending credits are intact on all episodes, and for the closing logo fans, the dark blue variant of the Jumbo Pictures logo and the Nickelodeon logo with the 1991 copyright year are both present. Episodes (with lengths) are as follows, per disc:

Disc 1:

1. Doug Bags A Neematoad (23:33)
2. Doug Can't Dance / Doug Gets Busted (23:31)
3. Doug's Dog's Date / Doug's Big Nose (22:46) *

Disc 2:

5. Doug Can't Dig It / Doug Didn't Do It (23:31)
6. Doug, Mayor for a Day / Doug's No Dummy (23:33)
7. Doug to the Rescue / Doug's Cool Shoes (22:46) *
8. Doug Gets His Ears Lowered / Doug On The Wild Side (22:47) *

Disc 3:

9. Doug's Big Catch / Doug Needs Money (23:32)
10. Doug's Doodle / Doug's Runaway Journal (22:47) *

12. Doug is Quailman / Doug Out in Left Field (22:46) *
13. Doug's Fair Lady / Doug Says Goodbye (22:46) *

Note: * represents episodes with the intro missing.

Special Features:

In a perfect world, there'd be promos, behind the scenes, commentary, deleted scenes, and much, much more. Sadly, this isn't a perfect world. You're just getting the episodes here. Nothing more, nothing less.

Final Comments:

Despite lack of extras and very cheap-looking menus, Doug is finally out on DVD. The episodes are uncut (minus a few missing intros), and the quality on par with the original airings. If you are a fan of the show, Nickelodeon, or the 90's in general, buy this DVD (and season 2)! The show hasn't been on reruns in a while (at least, in the US), so there's one more reason to buy it. If you need one more reason, think of it like this: Paramount damn sure won't put it out on DVD themselves, after the Nick Rewind collection failed badly in sales, so this is the only chance it has of getting an official DVD release. I highly recommend it, and here's hoping seasons 3 and 4 are added to CreateSpace.",1222387200,61,5605,4.62134944612286
3554904,5,B001EHDSOS,"Douglas Yancy Funnie has no incredibly special qualities. He's not half-ghost. He doesn't have a pair of wacky fairy godparents (though he does have a dog who thinks he's practically human) at his beck and call. He doesn't live under the sea. He's just a normal 12-year-old boy going through normal, REAL things and writing (or drawing) about it in his journal. And we love him just the way he is. From adjusting to a new environment, to getting your crush to notice you, to working through low self-esteem, this middle-schooler charmed his way through every episode dealing with these issues.

Doug was Nickelodeon's very first Nicktoon (and you may be interested to know that his voice is provided by Billy West of Futurama fame). It's very cute and fun, and you can't leave feeling anything but good, no matter your mood when you started. But if you're looking for outrageous situations and computer slick animation, look elsewhere.

Now, for content. If you're expecting extras - cast interviews, photo gallery, TV commercials, etc. - don't. You won't find it. The menus are plain and to the point, your only options being to choose an episode or play all of them, and that's it. This is as bare as it gets. However, the video quality is very good and played fine on my DVD player and computer. Despite the price for something so minimal, it's definitely worth getting. If you consider yourself a fan and want to support the show, get it for sure. Send a message to Nickelodeon that we want more seasons released.",1221091200,23,1517,4.742424242424242
