I've been searching for movies starring David Bowie and this was a pleasant surprise, since in several of his movies he's cast as an alien.
He even says that for this movie, he's a normal man but he still gets to wear ""aluminum shirts"" haha.
Bowie has a comedic side that comes out in this film and Rosanna Arquette is a nice counterpart making the movie quirky.
I didn't know it was repackaged from ""The Linguini Incident"" until I was looking for it in Amazon.
As the other reviewer said, the price for this movie is really high and you can get it cheaper in a local store or other online shopping sites (I saw one for $17.50 elsewhere.). I was very shocked this movie wasn't available on Amazon Video or iTunes. The digital copy would have been better. Still, I had to get my hands on it, and I did.",1466553600,2,929,4.284090909090909
8127633,5,B000FZ29AO,"I loved this movie. However, I just found out that this is the shamelessly repackaged version of 'The Linguini Incident', Why this is priced so high, I don't know, nor do I care. I can be found much, MUCH cheaper elsewhere, such as a local video store (Movie Trading Company, Walmart- movie section, etc....) Be it under this title or the original, I highly recommend watching it.",1452729600,6,380,4.686567164179104
