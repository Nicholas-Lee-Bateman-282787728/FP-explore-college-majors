7271223,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,I am way too excited for this. Cannot wait. Hope they include a bunch of deleted scenes.,1437436800,3,88,4.235294117647059
7271224,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,I really hope this doesn't end up turning into an Orb the size of a soccer ball. How can they fit 13 discs into the Orb that suppose to be the size of a soft ball. Hope the change the discs to be on the Orb Holders base or something but please don't ruin the size of the Orb.,1437350400,,275,3.6779661016949152
7271225,3,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Any chance the price on this could drop? I own the Phase 1 set and absolutely love it. All the memorabilia that came with it and the art sleeves for the movies themselves, everything was great. But I don't remember paying $250 for it. I think it might have been closer to $200? Anybody think the price might drop on this before the release? $130 for the movies sounds about right but another $120 for the packaging and bonus features? Seems a little steep... I've been holding out on buying any of the movies from Phase 2 (GOTG is the only one I bought so far, had to get that one) until the collection was released. So I would love to buy this set, just not sure about the price tag...",1437350400,5,686,4.244274809160306
7271226,2,B00Z7EMJ4E,"So let's see... let's do some math (I'm a professional mathematician  since I got a D.i.p.l.o.m.a in high school).  $250 divided by 6 movies equals...$41.66 per movie.  What a steal!!... literally, right from your CC.  Pass.  Anyone ever notice Disney movies hustle you any way they can?  Blue rays don't come with digital unless its over $30...or on sale for $25.  Digital movies all 20 or 15 on sale... But $41.66 per movie???  You can get 2 tickets for Disneyland for that.  I like the movies, don't like the hustle.  I'm sure the packaging is worth the extra $60 you wouldn't have paid if bought individually, because it includes a nifty led light.... right?",1437264000,21,662,4.728070175438597
7271227,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,I'm a huge Marvel fan and when phase 1 limited edition came out it was worth the cost because the memorabilia.(http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-Assembled-Incredible/dp/B0083SBMGW/ref=pd_rhf_cr_p_img_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1XMN4BTF19GW4Q4K9GB0) But when i saw this just had to have it. Mainly for Guardians and Ant-Man. Well worth the 250$ if you think about it the movies them selfs are about 25$ each for 6 that's 150$. So your actually spending an extra for a surprise bonus disc the power stone figure and whatever swag they throw in.,1437264000,9,546,6.012820512820513

7271235,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"This is the best Marvel movie collection there is. It's a little on the expensive side, but if you're a Marvel fan, it is a must have. Not only do you get DVDs and blurays of your favorite movies, but you also get really cool stuff that you see in the movies. Phase two like Phase one comes in a really cool case to keep the stuff in one place. I purchased  both of these over the years and I am glad I didn't try to buy each movie seperately.  I'm anticipating Phase Three in the next few years and will gladly pay any price, to have the next collection.",1518307200,,555,4.036363636363636

The packaging of the discs in the orb from Guardians of the Galaxy made me smile & the artwork for each disc sleeve was great.  The price was high thus making this (what I would consider) a high ticket item.

7271272,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Started collecting marvel movies and this is great!
Current price comes to about $30/movie which is about what they cost for 3D/blu/dig standalone anyways but this comes with some amazing extras. They really nailed the details on the smaller stuff, like the tiny replicas from the movies (name tags, sticky notes, news paper clippings etc) but even if you aren't into that stuff you still get an amazing bonus disc with all the marvel One shots, exclusive deleted scenes and bonus features. It all stores in a nice replica of the orb and its stand from Gaurdians of the galaxy

I was also lucky enough to accidentally receive two pages of codes for all the digital copies instead of one so I gave the extras to a friend.

Basically if you know you want all the marvel movies, get this while the price is low. Hell even as an investment this might be a good buy if it turns out anything like phase 1 (which went from less than $200 to $600).

Comes highly recommended. Can't wait for thenohase 3 box set",1493078400,,1002,4.4945054945054945
7271273,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,This box set is a must have for any Marvel Cinematic Universe fan. Everything this contains is worth the buy from each movie's individual art cover to the orb containing the power stone (purple infinity stone) you won't regret buying this.

7271275,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Worth it's price for the movies and memorabilia.  The slips that the movies come in are really not good quality though,  cheaply folded glued together with that kind of glue that holds perfume samples together in magizenes.

7271280,3,B00Z7EMJ4E,"The packaging and the extras you get with this are awesome, no doubt. However, it is really, really annoying that nowhere on the product page does it say that the Digital Copy codes will not work outside the US and Canada. BluRay/DVD region, yes. But I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that the Digital Copy codes should be able to be redeemed worldwide. Given that these are sold internationally, i.e. you can buy them on Amazon.com and have them shipped nearabout anywhere, it is incredibly frustrating that they would be packed with codes that are only valid in two countries. Considering the exchange rate, I paid nearly three hundred dollars for this and to find out that I cannot get my digital copies really, really sucks.",1489536000,4,737,4.765625

Fun to look at and well designed, sturdy for the most part as long as your not tossing it around. The cases of the DVDs have the same style artwork as the Phase One, which is fun.
Biggest drawback is the case files and goodies it comes with are completely separate, there is no way to hold them or store them within the display of the DVDs. It's a big deal for me, because now I have to go find a place to put them, when I would have much rather had them with the whole set. I ended up just putting them in the suitcase of Phase One, but if you didn't have Phase One, this would be a big problem.",1486512000,,718,4.063380281690141

7271324,3,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I purchased the previous phase one set and thought this was an inevitable purchase. Phase one if you were lucky enough to get it was an amazing purchase when I bought it on sale for 120$. It actually blew my mind the amount of information you get with it and little trinkets. It's naturally based off the tessaract. That being said this is meant to look like the casing where Star Lord Found the soul gem.

I paid 170$. Which I feel is kind of a rip off. You get half of the content of phase one. Also the ""casing"" is terrible. it literally all fell out of the package when me and my wife opened it. It just an open case on the back. The Blu rays all come with beautifully done art on paper gloss covers. They also come with the additional 3d copy. They all just fit together inside of the base of the soul gem case. The things that do come with it are nice little addons to the movies and will give you that nerd smirk that you love when you recognize it in the movie. However this whole set is probably truly worth 80-100 bucks and you're better off buying Them individually for the 10 bucks that they cost and downloading and making your own custom case.

In review it's half the quality of the Phase One which in Imo is a must buy. You can get away with not having this and just the regular Blu Ray. I'm glad I have this but I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone else. I'm just a superfan that loves collectibles.",1481846400,4,1430,4.121863799283154
7271325,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I caught onto the MCU bundles a bit late, I didn't get the Phase 1 set sadly, but I did get this one, and fans will adore it, blu rays, 3d, and digital download versions of the movies in phase 2.
the extra accessories and collectible things are nice, but the main potion of this is the replica orb from the Guardians of the Galaxy movie which is very nice to see, but feels quite light to hold. Only change id make is to put a bit of weight to the orbs container so it feels more satisfying to hold. Otherwise, I love this set.",1481241600,2,527,4.0285714285714285

7271333,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"You get all of MCU Phase 2 here. Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Solider, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and last but not least: Ant-Man. You get 2D and 3D copies of each movie, in addition to digital copies that you can redeem on VUDU and a few other movie streaming/download services. These are the same exact discs that come with each movie's individual release and includes all the special features and director commentaries you'd want. Additionally there is a special bonus content disc that includes even more stuff and it's hard to complain about more stuff.

The Orb is neat, but it does feel a bit cheap. The part that holds the discs is just as cheap and I wish there was some sort of divider between each movies so it'd be easier to grab the one I want to watch. It also would have been nice for there to have been some sort of door to keep the movies secure inside the case. Compared to the suitcase of the Phase One box set this feels like quite a bit step back since that one have individual compartments for each movie and since it was a suitcase it closed and you never had to worry about the discs falling out when you picked it up.

The props are great through, unfortunately there isn't as many as the Phase One set. Something nice though is that they do come in an envelope that easily slides into the suitcase from the Phase One set with all the props from that collection. Hopefully the Phase Three set realizes that it's nice to have everything contained nicely in one place and comes in a case that holds your movies securely and gives you a place to store whatever props it comes with since even though it worked this time, I don't think the Phase One suitcase can hold another envelope.

Since you do get a lot of movies and a lot of neat stuff, the value is still great and I'd recommend buying it if you are a collector of this sort of stuff. Otherwise you could probably just get away with buying just your favorite MCU films individually.",1477699200,3,2017,4.373333333333333

The bonus features are, in typical Marvel fashion, a bit of a letdown. Seriously, why is every featurette so short? The orb is very fun and always a conversation piece when people see it and I press down on the ""gem,"" only for it to start glowing purple. Any Marvel fan will love this. The extras that you receive in the envelope are way better than Phase One's and include some true gems such as, Tony Stark's ""Jarvis is my co-pilot"" sticker, a temporary tattoo of Tony Stark's face, and Tony Stark's ID card from Iron Man 3. Why didn't they just package this as Tony Stark's face? Perhaps that will be Phase Four.",1476057600,,726,4.466165413533835

The covers that hold the two discs for each individual movie were coming apart when I received the item. There is also no place to put the additional items that come with the collection (stickers, artifacts and other little trinkets) so I had to stuff them into my first collection.

The printed extras are as good as the previous ones, but the reason why I give it a 5 star (I only gave 4 to the Phase 1) because of the digital codes, and the orb. The tesseract looks very lame compared to this, and the phase 1 briefcase is more like a lunchbox but this is way better. The orb is very detailed, I love that we can actually open it and get the power stone, and the stand which is also the case for the bd disc is also very authentic. The price is also very fair! The bonus disc has now a proper menu which is also plus point.

On the other hand I have to agree with the ones who claimed that the bd cases are aweful. They are not well sticked. Sometimes I can't pull out the disc easily because it has stucked into the glue!:/

In the end it's still a great job in my opinion, can't wait the Phase 3 box set, only 3 and a half years.:D",1462838400,,1019,3.824644549763033

They aren't big parts just the strike patch and the avengers key chain. Sure they are not hard to replace. But when I pay 250+ bucks for something like this.

Price was reasonable however probably it costs $40- $50 above what it should cost in Singapore dollars. Nevertheless, Item was as described and is something that I would still recommend anyone who are a fan of the movies to get as it comes with quite a few collectibles.

A few things to note: The orb is not as grand as it looks in the pictures. It appears a bit cheap. But still a nice piece to have. I haven't watched all the movies yet to know if they all work fine.

The downside is that my captain America movie cover was slightly damaged as it was folded when I got it. And because it is a paper kind of material, it has a mark left on it from the folding.",1458172800,,889,4.156976744186046

Overall looks relatively decent, however this set is expensive and the quality just doesn't justify the cost. Chief complaints, batteries died almost instantly, the ""infinity stone"" is cheap frosted plastic with zero design, the lighting in the orb is poor and provides no wow factor, the stand has no latch to contain the movies - they will simply slide out if the unit is tilted, the additional extras can't be stored in the stand, no sound effects, no additional lights, etc. Suggest for Phase Three they eliminate the 3D versions and put some effort into the packaging, this one is a near total miss. I do appreciate that digital versions were included, one bright spot in this disappointing mess.",1456704000,,844,4.868055555555555

The Orb is far easier to display and the light it emits much better than the phase one ""bruise my hand to light it up"" experience. Additionally, with the Blu Rays displayed openly in the Orb stand, they are far more accessible than the phase one briefcase.

Don't get me wrong. I LOVED the phase one set. I think I love this set more.

It has all of the movies and some really awesome goodies, and the box art from the first set makes a much awaited return. The only negatives are that the Infinity stone doesn't exactly have a super bright shine, which is nit picky I know, and that you can tell some of the discs where just kind of shoved into their packaging.

Then we got to the extras.  Oh my goodness, we loved them.  Whoever planned these extras really paid attention to detail.  I don't want to spoil it, because the extras are awesome to open like a present, but there are a lot of them, and they are so well thought out.  It was like opening your grandmas old chest and finding all sorts of wonderful memorabilia of her life (if your grandma was a superhero or spy).

After all of the extras had been viewed, we looked at the plastic construction with new eyes.  Its about the same quality as the phase 1 set, and it is very much worth it if you are a crazy fan.

Having owned Phase One since it released, I was scared and excited for this when it went up for preorder, but being the marvel fan that I am, I had to have it...... I was excited cause the paper props and replicas in the first set were excellent, scared because the Tessaract, well let's face it, was garbage....... This set is kind of the opposite, The Orb is amazing, really nice quality. Tho the orb uses a white led, I feel they could have gotten a better effect using a brighter purple led. But thats a minor annoyance, from someone whos really picky.....

The paper props however, while being a good quality, left some thing to be desired. It honestly felt like ""Well we ran out of things to include so why not some temporary tattoos and a set of crappy bar coasters"" its not that those items are bad quality,  and a lot of people will probably like them, they just didn't make sense to me as a hardcore Marvel fan and collector.....

I would say the plastic of the orb stand is a little cheap, but considering it's a ""toy"" I'm not too mad about it. All the movie cases contain two formats which is also nice.

7271500,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,The movies were as awesome as I remembered them to be and the added extras along with the special features only clarified how great this is as a box set. As for the model it is a lot of fun but from a functional point of view it is a bit inconvenient because there are multiple parts that aren't contained but it's not a huge issue so long as you don't have grabby children or ambitious cats. I loved the art work on the movie casings unfortunately I had to touch up some of the glue and even fix the scoring/ refold one of the blue-ray cases... not a horrible situation but not everyone has the tools or desire to repair new things immediately after getting them. Over all it's a good investment if your looking to add to your MCU collection while having some great movie marathons with your friends and it looks pretty swanky too.,1453680000,,832,4.305732484076433

7271520,3,B00Z7EMJ4E,I should give it less than four stars due to quality. The discs and digital copies are great and I like the stand and the orb. The problem with this set is that the cases for the discs themselves are unfinished messes. They aren't folded properly along the spine and they aren't sealed properly so the discs fall out. For the price of this product it would be better worth my money if it had been a completed product and not half done.,1452729600,,435,4.253012048192771

Highlights for me are:
-Digital copies included (didn't have them on the Phase 1 collection)
-The orb is super detailed
-The extra goodies are a blast. I had a real fun time guessing which movie they were from (and then fact checking myself, lol). My favorites of the items were: Anthony's wing and the ""Jarvis is my Co-Pilot"" bumper sticker
-The bonus!! Love the new deleted scenes and the one-shot commentaries were cool, never heard those before",1452384000,,558,4.752577319587629

7271526,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Look what we got for our anniversary. I'm so glad I married a geeky girl so we can get cool things like this to commemorate our love. We got the first one because they suckered us with the replica props and our very own tesseract. We liked it enough to get Phase 2.

The first go around I loved the replica props and how they were arranged by movie and made to look like they came from official SHEILD files. They would be fun to display someday. The tesseract was disappointing. Looked cheep, but it kind of lit up a bit.

For Phase 2 it was the opposite. The packaging and the infinity stone looked really cool, but the replica props were not on the same level as Phase 1. There are some cool props but I feel like there are less in Phase 2 and that they aren't as interesting. I took pictures of everything so you can check them out for yourself on my blog (http://wp.me/p19qVZ-vi).

Thor: The Dark World has some really cool pages for being one of the weakest movies of the phase. But my favourite is the one page contract that the Avengers have to sign that causes the Civil War in a couple of months.

I wonder if the packaging was determined by which movie was the most popular and got the most buzz? Everything comes in the orb from Guardians of the Galaxy instead of something from Age of Ultron which brings all these movies togetherkind of. Either way the orb looks legit. It'll go nice on our book case of geekdom.

The only complaint I have about the packaging is there is no built in place to put the replica props once they're out of the box. I ended up putting them in the tesseract case with the Phase 1 stuff.

So should you get this? On Amazon.com (do not use amazon.ca if you can avoid it. It's always more expensive) this is $180. There are 6 blue rays and 3d movies in here which outside the box set costs $159 (you can get them for cheaper if you don't want 3d or special editions). So would I pay an extra $20 for the orb and other replica props?

Absolutely yes.

Our family has moved beyond getting individual movies just to watch whenever we want. The last time we bought a bunch of movies (Except for our boxing day tradition of getting a few $3 blue rays) was Phase 1. Adding the extras is almost the only thing that will get me to buy more movies. I hope others follow suit.

Maybe Star Wars will come with a replica Lightsaber!",1452297600,,2358,4.245535714285714
7271527,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,The set of movies were all pretty good - each has their own ups and downs. However the bonus content was definitely a fun nod to most things in the film and the upcoming films.,1452297600,,176,4.057142857142857
7271528,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,great product.,1452297600,,14,6.5
7271529,3,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Movies aside - since we are interested in the box set: a relative comparison

Cons - As some of us knew, the Phase I case was plastic and...weird. It was good fun though. The items inside were super! If anyone is familiar with Loot Crate (great though they may be) Phase II seemed more in line with that. Phase II included things not from the movies but rather some coasters..or temporary tattoos. Things with Marvel stuff just sprinkled on it. I almost expected to see some Iron Man pop rocks. There are some neat items but as far as movie ""memorabilia"" is concerned, it was pretty disappointing. I even had to take a minute before writing this review. Relax. I'm better now. Phase I gave us a fun puzzle to solve that then inducted us into SHIELD. I hoped to see something for sniffing out Hydra or something. Some items were REALLY cool but overall - mediocre to bad. I'd have almost rather not gotten fake tattoos and post it notes and that garbage. My set included one stray paperclip. It is probably my favorite item due to the mysterious nature of its inclusion. The badge, specimen item, and Dark Elf page were particularly awesome which leads me to the pros.

Pros - Phase II does include 3d blu ray, blu ray, and DIGITAL COPIES! Phase I just had the blu rays. Those digital copies are a nice get. I was very pleased with that. The packaging is creative and fun. Consider that we are spending ~30ish for 3 copies of each movie with some fun infinity gems

If you want to collect the box sets - definitely scoop this. The art on the sleeves was a little less minimal than the Phase I art but it looks good. These collections are fun ways to get into the spirit of your next movie marathon. I got mine in hopes someone would come over for 45 hours and watch them all with me. You're all invited.

tl;dr 3.5 stars.
HUGE bonus for digital copies
fun package (despite what people say, I think it is in line with the first collection - if yours is breaking it's likely faulty and you should exchange it)
extra items were mostly weak. (which was a big deal to me. Those were the best parts of Phase I)",1452211200,,2103,4.357142857142857

7271548,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Not going to review the movies themselves but the case, items and special features. I like that the case to save movies in is small when compared to the Phase One Briefcase. It makes it easier to find a spot to show it off or to have it put away when necessary, but not having a spot to save the documents that come with kind of sucks. The bonus features are the standard deleted scenes, gag reel and Marvel One Shots. The bonus disc gives some insight to the ""behind the scenes"" of the movies but it isn't a making of. It also sets up Phase 3 bit. Its great that this includes the digital version of the movies which Phase One didn't. The Items are the type of things that are cool for people who are really into the movies but may not be that ""WOW"" for those who are just causal fans.

7271553,2,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I give them 2 stars for having a good idea but it was executed poorly. Marvel Studios makes my favorite comic book movies but this set does not do the films Justice. It is just made of flimsy, cheap materials. For $190 after tax I expected way better. The films are better than this and they deserve better treatment. The day I got this I sealed it up and sent it back. I sold my Phase 1 set as well and used the money to start collecting the NovaMedia Korean imported versions of these films. They come with a steelbook case in a slide box with incredible artwork. The best presentation of these films yet if you ask me. Also they fit on your shelf like a nice clean library instead of this cheap piece of garbage. They are region free discs and the packaging is in English as well so they don't look foreign at all.

I wish this was better quality, I was hoping it would be. The only thing that was great was the extra bonus disc but that wasn't worth $190. I'm hoping Marvel comes out with a nice phase 1-3 library set in the future. This prop design stuff is just silly. I'm done with it.",1450742400,,1092,4.1753554502369665

It really feels like it's a continuation of the set. The folder contains a lot of stuff, but there's only one of them. I would have liked a liiiittle more stuff with this set. If you have Phase One, you get a SHIELD folder for each of the films/characters. This you have one brown envelope full of little bits from all the movies.

The orb base is a little more lightweight than I'd really like, but I don't plan on carrying it around all that much, so that's fine. I'm not altogether sure whether I'll use the stickers or keep the set intact as a collectible.

I received this item as an early birthday present and it met all my expectations.  It came with all of the Phase 2 Marvel Films  ( Iron Man 3 - Ant-Man )  as well as a bonus disc that has tons of cool stuff like Deleted Scenes and lots of concept work from the Phase 2 movies.  There is even a very cool look at all of Phase 2 and a small preview of Phase 3.

Like Phase 1 , which came in a suitcase. Phase 2 come with an Orb that glows and includes an Infinity Stone.. Also like Phase 1 , the Phase 2 set comes with some cool little trinkets.  Now being the fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I am ...I always look forward to seeing what Marvel has in store for the end of that Phase box set.  Personally, it is a wonderful addition to my collection.  This item is a must for any movie collection or Marvel fan.",1450137600,,1318,5.517412935323383

The orb on top, with the infinity stone, is not attached to the base, it just sits on top. The envelope with the bonus materials, has no way to be attached or stored in the display container. Not nearly as self containing as the phase 1.

With the price drop to $185 on December 8th (originally was listed for $225 or so), it worked out to be an extra $5 or so to get all the movies at once with the display container and bonus features. While you have to be careful when taking out and putting away the discs to avoid scratching them, the artwork is nicer (IMO) than the photo ones on regular cases.

7271575,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"This is a review of the box set. NOT the movies.

First, let's start with the packaging: It's not ideal. It's cumbersome and elaborate. It protects the contents within the box, but for those who like to keep their box in as near-mint condition as they can, opening it will be time consuming.

Now the actual product within the box is pretty great. The little nick-knacks within the replica Russian dossier as seen at the end of Winter Soldier has a bunch of little things. Photos, Tony Stark's name tag from his 1999 convention as seen in Iron Man 3, really cheap looking coasters that look Asgardian. If you'd like to see all of the items within the box, check out my YouTube channel: E-diots

The actual Orb replica looks great. However, it feels cheap. The Infinity Stone Replica is a good size, too.

Overall, this is a fine buy if you can get it on sale in the $189-200 range. I would say stay away from the full retail $250 cost.",1449878400,,935,4.4186046511627906

Another things is a baskin Robbins card with the name jack on if. The rest of the stuff is just as lame. The first phase was a cool briefcase that lit up. This one is cheaply made plastic dvd holder. It doesn't even hold the ""extra"" stuff, so you know it's going to end up in a junk drawer. Great movies, but very disappointing.",1449705600,2,591,4.192982456140351

7271582,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"for the price its OK; everything was packed nicely but the box was a little hard to open due to misleading tape on sides. the discs are easily accessed out of a little slot in the back of the packaging if you want to keep the orb and stand in the box until you have a place to display them. the disc folders are exactly the same as with the phase 1 set, cheap glossy cardboard bifolds with very nice artwork that should have been on a steelbook. Honestly I know what the set was but, for the price, I would have liked for the movies to be a little better packaged(as I said before steelbooks would have been better) and the orb to not feel like a $30 children's toy(maybe dicast metal and pewter with the orb made out of tempered glass instead of thick plastic). The set does have the blurays in both 3D and regular as well as digital copy, though for redemption through a 3rd party site(not Disney movie rewards, iTunes or Vudu). For the most part, aside from the few caveats I've already mentioned, this is a pretty good set that would definitely be at home in someones display case.",1449705600,2,1085,4.297560975609756

With that said, it is still a decent collectible to have all the movies in one set; I just don't believe what they give you for the bonus extras are worth the extra $70 price difference from phase one.",1449705600,2,467,3.978723404255319

7271587,1,B00Z7EMJ4E,"First off just like the title says the review is on the packaging only. The set is great, but the blu-ray catboard sleeves are defective.

7271588,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"The set looks amazing; however, I would have preferred that the sleeves for the movies would be in some sort of actual case (like the Phase 1 box set) rather than just slide into the base for the Infinity Stone orb where they can get dusty and slide out when I pick it up (as they did when I pulled the set out of the box, not realizing where they were kept).

I see some complaints that the sleeves were not glued together properly and that there were issues with the discs falling out; I can happily  report that that doesn't seem to be the case with my set.

I purposely held off on buying any of the Phase 2 films in hopes that there would be a box set released like there was for Phase 1.  I was not disappointed. Price was about $40 higher than what I paid for the Phase 1 set when I pre-ordered that one, but then again, there are more films in this set, so I can get over the price.

Overall, I'm very satisfied and can't wait to dive into all the special features for each film and the bonus disc.",1449705600,,1006,4.0606060606060606
7271589,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I personally own the Phase 1 Collectors Edition. I can tell you that this is built more sturdier than the case from the Phase 1 set. The base of the set stores the Blu-Rays neatly inside. The Orb itself lights up beautifully inside. Enormous detail went into it. It looks like the real thing from Guardians of the Galaxy.

You get 3d Blu-Rays, regular Blu-Rays and a digital code for all the Phase 2 films, including a bonus disc. The bonus disc has never before seen deleted scenes for every movie that are not on the Blu-Rays, as well as production art and all of the Marvel One Shots with commentary by the stars of the shorts.

The set also comes with The Winter Soldiers Dossier which is an envelope including a Jarvis is My Co-Pilot bumper sticker, Avengers and S.T.R.I.K.E. patches, a page from the book Odin showed about The Aether, Luis' Pym Tech security badge, Ant-thonys Wings found after his death, Scott Langs Baskin Robins name tag, a Ten Rings temporary tatoo, Asguardian table coasters, pictures of Bucky in WW2 and frozen as The Winter Soldier, Heiroglyphics from the temple at Morag, Stark R&D Post-It Notes.

7271590,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,This is an extremely amazing collectors edition for Marvels Phase 2 Cinematic Universe. I love the art style of the individual movie sleeves that follows in the keeping of the previous collectors edition of Phase 1. The Orb prop replica is pretty neat as well as it has a toggle switch enabled light that illuminates the gem inside. Not to mention a plethora of sweet prop replicas from the movies.,1449619200,,398,4.7
7271591,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"The only real standout here is the replica of the Orb from Guardians of the Galaxy, which is so much more detailed than the corresponding Tesseract prop from the Phase 1 box set, and the fact the the Orb actually HAS an Infinity Stone included fills me with geeky excitement. That being said, the Phase 1 collection set the bar so high in everything else that this one feels a little underwhelming.

The Phase 1 set had a clear theme going on, between all the little props being held in separate files, the ID card that came with it, and the briefcase to hold it all, it made you feel like a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent. All of the items felt like little snippets that S.H.I.E.L.D. could have feasibly collected, which gave the entire collection a sense of unity. With the Phase 2, you have the Orb from Guardians... and then everything else is held inside a replica of the Russian file from Winter Soldier. They're both cool things, but it doesn't feel like they belong together the same way all the stuff from Phase 1 did. Adding to that, the little knickknacks they included in the Phase 2 set feel much less substantial and cool. There's pictures, there's replica drawings, stickers, and even a temporary tattoo, but nothing quite as awesome and complete as Arc Reactor blueprints or personnel files on S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents or property, albeit heavily redacted ones.

There's also a lot less functionality in how this collection was put together compared to the first phase. Phase 1 gave you a briefcase to hold everything in that made it really easy to keep track of everything and carry it around with you. This collection has the Orb itself, the stand (and as far as I can tell there's no way to attach the Orb TO the stand), and the file, with nothing to put it all in besides the big box that it originally came in, and unless you want to painstakingly reinsert the packaging every time it's all going to rattle around in there. Also, while I like the idea of using the Orb stand to hold the discs, it really could have used a latch of some kind so that the movies won't go sliding out if you tilt it the wrong way.

All in all, I'm glad I bought it, and I'd say it's a worthwhile purchase for anyone who's a die-hard fan of these movies. I just hope Marvel steps their game up if and when they do a Phase 3 collection, because the design of this box set just can't match up to Phase 1.",1449619200,4,2385,4.415909090909091
7271592,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I'm one of those people who specifically bought this set less for the ""collector's"" aspect and more for the hope of a lot more behind the scenes and deleted content, especially for Thor: The Dark World.  On that point, I am severely disappointed. There is one newly presented scene with a pretty interesting shift in Odin's characterization, but beyond that and the one just released on youtube by Marvel - they're pretty ""meh"".  The pre-visualization animatics are worthless in my world; and should (and could, judging by random online tidbits) have been replaced with more real-world content for each film.  The movie discs themselves are the exact same as those from the individual releases.  Having all the One Shots together in one place is pretty cool, though.  In deciding whether the whole shebang is worth keeping or not, I've come down on the side of this rather than the individual cost of each bluray/3D bluray film.  If you already own at least half of them, it's probably best to just go ahead and buy the others rather than shell out for this box.  You won't be missing out on much at all.",1449619200,3,1104,4.71875
7271593,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"This is a great set. I like how the disc sleeves are labeled on the spine and stored in a single stack compared to the Phase 1 briefcase box set, though I wish they could be secured inside the orb base and that the sleeves were better quality. I love that they continued with the great disc sleeve art from the Phase 1 set and it would have been even nicer if this art was printed on the actual discs.

The bonus material does not fit into the Phase 2 base but, for those with the Phase 1 briefcase box set, you can store the Phase 2 envelope with bonus items inside the briefcase if you properly arrange the items within the envelope. First put in all the thin paper items, then arrange the thicker items (notepad, id badge, slide, coasters, etc) along one side of the envelope. Keeping the contents in place, slide the envelope into the briefcase holder with the thin side on the interior next to the tesseract and the thick side towards the handle of the case. The case should now close and keep all your bonus material in one place.",1449619200,50,1036,4.312820512820513
7271594,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Ultimate collectible for the ultimate Marvel Cinematic Universe fan.  The Power Gem orb and stand are very cool and makes for great presentation.  The discs themselves are housed in the back of the base of the statue.

The discs themselves are all standard:  Blu Ray & Blu Ray 3D discs with all of the original features that came out on the original Blu Ray releases of the movies.  The key disc in the set is the Bonus Features disc which provides an in-depth Phase 1/Phase 2 Retrospective with a preview of what's coming in Phase 3 with Captain America: Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther.  This disc alone made the set worth buying.

My only complaint with this set:  the Phase 1 set is a case that is also able to house the extra prop items/files along with the discs and the Tesseract prop.  This Phase 2 set, however, comes with a folder full of props from the six Phase 2 movies, but there is nowhere to keep them, so you have to store them either in a desk drawer or just put the folder underneath the base of the Orb stand.",1449619200,,1074,4.35678391959799

This means that I take much stock in snooty, elitist comments about the quality of the packaging or the exclusivity of the contents. The memorabilia is fun, though I agree with some that it is not quite up to par with the MCU Phase 1 stuff. Still though, it's a blast looking through it. The orb itself is really, really cool, as is the base that holds it (the movies slide into the back of the base for storage). Yes, the orb and base are plastic. What did expect, vibranium?  The inclusion of digital HD copies is a huge plus (they work with iTunes). The movies are, of course, great. Blu-Ray Ant Man upscaled to 4K on my fancy-schmancy TV? Yes please!

7271597,4,B00Z7EMJ4E,"Ok so good set. I don't write many reviews but felt compelled to. But let me explain. Others have posted pictures so you know what you're getting inside and out. Yes it is poorly packaged because the envelope cannot be contained like the phase one briefcase set. However the idea of having all blurays 3D and digital downloads are pretty neat and a good value if you use them! My only objection is that you're paying for the 3D versions whether you like that or not. As far as movies are concerned etc and the display, it is quite nice and you have probably seen the movies so you know those are great by themselves alone. Please bear in mind if you do not have the phase one set to expect a cheapish plastic material and to struggle a tiny bit on taking out the cardstock sleeves. So the long and short of it? Assuming 30$ per movie and you're only paying 5$ for the container and collectible merchandise. So I'd recommend this if you do not own any of the movies included already (Iron Man 3- Ant Man) this is a good purchase. Or if you have 180$ to spend and are a huge collector then sure! Otherwise I'd weigh the price for the movies you don't own yet versus the cost of obtaining the set. Also if you have a Disney account? The digital download codes are worth 1200 points about enough to for a free movie from Disney. Hope this helps! 4 stars for movies. Marvel. And the display. Minus 1 for the price and the extras which may or may not be your cup of tea.",1449532800,,1464,4.232142857142857
7271598,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I was thoroughly impressed with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-Phase-One/dp/B0083SBMGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One</a>, with its collectible replica suitcase holding the Tesseract, along with lots of physical bonus content. That suitcase was a delight to open and made me feel like I was part of the movies.

Phase Two attempts to replicate that emotion by presenting you with a reproduction of an Infinity Stone in its Orb (as featured in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'), along with a bunch of other bonus content that puts you right in Marvel's Universe. The Orb splits apart like in the movie, with a locking mechanism to keep the halves together. There is a separate purple Infinity Stone you can place in the middle, with a hidden button in the Orb that lights the stone from an LED below.

 MOVIES 
The movie discs are located in sleeves in the back of the Orb display stand, but there is no mechanism to keep the sleeves in place so if you hold the display slanted, all the sleeves will slide out. The movie sleeves are designed in the same beautiful art direction as Phase One, so I love the consistency throughout these phases.

Phase Two includes the following movies (Each has a Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, digital copy):
 Iron Man 3
 Thor: The Dark World
 Captain America: The Winter Soldier
 Guardians of the Galaxy
 Avengers: Age of Ultron
 Ant-Man
+ Top Secret Bonus Disc (Which isn't very top secret, nor hidden. It's included in Bonus Disc sleeve.)

 EXTRAS 
Along with the Orb, you get extras in a square envelope that houses an assortment of in-movie memorabilia related to all the films [see photos]. There are not as high quality and in-depth as Phase One, but they are pretty cool.

 DISNEY MOVIES ANYWHERE 
Unlike Phase One, Phase Two provides digital copies of all the movies with DisneyMoviesAnywhere. Sign up for an account and you can link it to Amazon Video, iTunes, Google Play, and more. Once you link your accounts to Disney, your select Disney movies show up in all your other connected platforms. This makes the set much more valuable and accessible for people digitizing their collections. That also means the price will be higher. I think these days, digital copies are necessary for people buying any type of collector's edition.

 SUMMARY 
The price is reasonable considering you get the 3D Blu-ray discs, regular Blu-ray discs, digital copies, along with a cool Orb, and collectibles. Separately, these would cost more than the individual sets combined. Recommended.",1449532800,63,2598,5.199519230769231
7271599,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"OMG I love this! I think I like it even more then the first phase. Can't wait to see what phase three will look like. Also I paid approx 184.00 for this and I feel that the cost is justified. You get 6 movies each in 3D blu-ray, blu-ray, and digital copy.  To get one of these movies on the first week of release at Best Buy you are paying anywhere from 25-30 dollars. So if you do 6 x 25 you get 150 dollars. So then if I take the 184-150 it looks like I am paying an additional 34.00 dollars. This 34 dollars goes to the bonus disk, all the little memorabilia goodies, the case itself, and if you're like me bragging rights (lol).

Honestly I feel the price is justified. I hope this helps. Enjoy!",1449532800,,699,4.057971014492754
7271600,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"The 5 star rating is given for the idea and value of this item. I love Marvel and I have the Phase 1 Collection. I held off buying any Phase 2 Blu Rays because I knew a box set was coming out. (Except the Steelbook version of TWS. I really liked that movie)

Price wise, I have no gripes. I think it's very reasonable for the content included in this set. Also, the additional props/memorabilia are very thoughtful and accurate. There's a post-it pad that is actually made by Post-it! The orb has a white LED in it to illuminate the stone. It's really cool.

I love this set and I have no complaints about it.

However, I'm not too happy about the quality.

1. The discs holders are rushed/not complete. All 7 of the disc holders' glue was dried up. If you held the disk holders horizontally, the discs fell out. I had to press on the glue to make them stick again. (After 1 minute, they came loose again)

2. Whoever packed my set wasn't paying attention. All of my discs were jammed in together and some were inside each other. (Some disks holders were inside other disc holders. They weren't separate). This caused my TWS holder to fray/rip on the top right corner.

3. Cheap plastic. If you thought the Phase 1 box set was cheap, think again. The plastic is so thin on the base, it bent from just holding it.

4. A few of the memorabilia were creased and bent. Not happy.

Overall, I love this set. But Marvel could really, really improve on the quality of their box sets. It seems like they took a step BACKWARD this time.

Also, don't forget to claim your Disney Move Rewards points with the Digital HD codes!

Hopefully the Phase 3 set is better! :)

Also, it seems like they just took separate Blu-Rays and packed it into 1 box set. Phase 1 was recognized as 1 individual product on Disney's site. But with Phase 2, the movies were recognized seperately. Maybe it's because each movie had a Digital HD copy whereas Phase 1 didn't.",1449532800,154,1938,4.385474860335195

I WOULD like the cases to be a little more study, since they're just cardboard, but hey, it's not like I'll be chucking them across the room or anything to see how they hold up.

My main gripe with the Phase 2 set is that it seems to come with a lot fewer prop replicas/memorabilia than the Phase 1 set. With Phase 1, you had a dedicated folder for each movie, with a good amount of quality props - I'd say 5-10 for each movie. With this one, you get one folder in total and maybe one or two props from each movie. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the items that came with it (I won't spoil them!) and I think the quality is decent. But for the price of this set, and compared to Phase 1, I don't think it comes with enough.

Overall I'm satisfied since I knew it was on the expensive side and went for it anyways. The bonus disc and prop replicas are what really sell it for me, even if I DO own all the movies anyways.",1449532800,5,1392,3.9151943462897525

My guess is that the housing is in the base of the orb stand for the discs. Those guys did such a hack job on it and it still looked amazing. Didn't even get into the stand at all. Love the orb. The packet comes with way more than what they show in the picture on Amazon but for some reason they refused to show it all (again CBR is a joke). Plus it is actually reasonably priced for a collectors set. I imagine they packed the discs separately because they got so many complaints of damaged discs because they'd slip out of the sleeves in the briefcase on the phase 1 pack.

It would have been better if it came with more things, like the hydra files on bucky that Natasha gad steve in the end credits of Winter soldier. And Sam Wilsons Project Falcon file. Maybe even the flash drive. The tiny glass bottle with the yellow jacket suit inside could have easily been added. This set is dissapointing, the light effect on the power gem is very poor and doesnt light the gem, it just magnifies the light bulb behind it.

Any of *those* bonus discs would make this seriously worthwhile.
Since I had already purchased all the movies in Phase 1 before buying the 'exclusive' set, I was more than a little disappointed to see that the only 'bonus' disc I got was Clark Gregg introducing all the Avengers.  Yes, having the collector's case and the Tesseract is 'nice' but I'd much rather have something like the MARVEL documentary or Seasons of the TV shows included.
Another irksome little thing was the 'paper' sliders for the discs instead of plastic or even heavy-duty paper to protect them, although I suppose they figured that since the discs are in a 'classified carrying case' anyway, anything more substantial inside would be superfluous.",1441756800,4,1010,4.8604651162790695

Now we also own all of phase 2 movies except for the last 2 movies and we will get them with the set and we will again give away the individual movies to less fortunate friends and family, I just wish they'd go into detail on what the extras are going to be and the packaging is going to be like, I also wanna know what cool props and extras we will get so please release pictures of the set soon and a list of what all were paying for with this set and yeah your getting all media versions with this set so if you buy each on 3D with digital copy then you've almost covered the price e of the special collectors set and if your not a collector go buy them separate on DVD or buy the digital copies and have a good day otherwise just don't bitch about it and have a coke and a smile and shut the hell up",1440547200,10,1185,3.8565573770491803

7271631,5,B00Z7EMJ4E,"The product at the time of this review is $224.99, ouch. However, unbeknownst to me, this price is not set in stone. They price a lot of products more expensive then they are in the beginning and then eventually knock down the price. I've seen prices knock down by insane amounts various times. A lot of people who apparently have never pre-ordered anything are writing premature reviews on this product that has yet at the time I am writing this to even get a specific release date. Due to these people the product has a fairly low rating and may continue to decrease. One of the only reviews that made some sense is the one about DVD's not being included. The reason for that is simple, not a lot of people will buy or watch them. We live in an age where people want the best, DVD isn't. Not only will a lot of people not pay for a premium DVD set like this, but it is incredibly expensive to manufacture. Bundle both? If this set included DVD's it would cost exponentially more. Not to mention it would be pretty difficult to fit them in there. Most people are only gonna watch one anyways so there's no real point. If you want the DVD's, you're gonna have to unfortunately buy them separately.",1438646400,28,1197,4.396396396396397
7271632,3,B00Z7EMJ4E,"I give this a 3 stars not based on films, but rather because until this set releases, it's just my opinion, and kind of pointless on speculation.

I just want to say why this isn't a bad deal. Currently as of July 28th, the phase 2 set is $224.99.

The high school guy doing math is a moron, so I'll just avoid his ""math"". Retail cost these movies are set as 34.99 (for the 3D Blu Ray and Digital). So for the moment, these films combined are $210. But I'll be more fair. These films at release are always $22, that's how much I spent when I get em. So for now it's only $88 since Ultron and Ant Man aren't out. But even if they were, you would be spending a total of $132 on films alone. I list both prices for a few reasons.

You might be a person who didn't get any if these films, so the collection is a consideration to get all in one. For that, you can probably get a few of these cheap and still just get them individually.

Another person might have the films already so honestly, why get em? If you don't care for some of the bonus stuff, not a fan of pricing, or other reasons. Avoid the set, so it would seem.

Lastly another would be someone who has them already, and just wants it as a second collection, probably the smallest percentage of those buying. I, myself, would be one of these.

We still have yet to see what the product looks like, so we can't speculate on if the other stuff is worth the investment. But for now the price will not stay the same. Many were complaining a week back because of the $250 price...it is now $225, and I'm willing to bet it will only go lower. So for now I'd refrain from bashing merely on price.

On the notion of pricing, this is a deluxe set; often considered a ""collector's"" item; so this isn't marketed towards the average movie goer trying to watch these films. Collectors are one of the weirdest set of people  (once more, I include myself) we spend hundreds of dollars for trivial things. So realistically I add, do you think Marvel/Comic Book fanboys, whom are collectors; care for the price? Not really. So before going to bash, consider who the target audience is for this set.

For the reason why the DVD'S are not included, is because this is just a repackaging of the individual 3D blu ray sets. So don't expect them from now on, especially since Disney does not do DVD's anymore on their releases.

I won't review the movies because this is a product. If you want movie reviews, go on IMDb, movie forums, comic book forums, or just go watch the movie yourself.

I hope to update and tell others how the set turns out when I actually receive, but for now we can only speculate. For now it gets a neutral rating of 3 stars.",1438041600,32,2688,4.250980392156863
