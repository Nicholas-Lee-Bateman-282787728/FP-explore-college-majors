8028006,5,B0002HBTHE,"the matches are from season 1:

1st match:  tag team

Heavy Metal sisters  vs. the Southern Belles (Scarlet & Tara)

(Spike & Chainsaw)

in this match, the Heavy Metal sisters humilate the Southern Belles. Especially Tara, who is treated like a wet dog. She is forced to run through her own hoop (her costume hoop) three times. The third time, Tara runs throught it while the hoop is in flames.

2nd match: the HeadHunters (Mina & Mika)  vs.  the Cheerleaders(Susie Spirit & Debbie Debutante)

 Susie Spirit gets her arm broken in this match. Susie Spirits does a sunset flip on one of the HeadHunters but the HeadHunter extends out her leg and breaks Susie's arm. This happens in the beginning of the match. So the match is canceled altogether. Susies arm is dislocated/broken for real. This was no gimmick. As a result, Susie didn't wrestle during the middle half of the season. She did return at the end of the season with an arm cast and fought against Attache(the mean Marine) in a singles match and won.

3rd match: Matilda the Hun (280lbs.) vs. Mountain Fiji(350lbs)

this match is the lumber jack match. where there are good girls & bad girls surrounding the outside ropes of the the ring. So the wrestlers can remain in the ring w/o falling out. the girls surrounding the ring are: (Good Girls) Olympia,Tammy Jones,California Doll,Ebony,Scarlet(the Southern Belle),&Little Fiji. (Bad Girls) Jungle Woman,Spanish Red,Hollywood & Vine,Ninothcha,Corporal Kelly. No one wins but the match becomes a battle royal. Corporal Kelly fires a gun and demands a battle royal. And most of the girls are escorted out by security guards while still fighting and wrestling.

2nd hr of the DVD is just a recap of all the highlights matches of season 1. Most of the matches are shown in few second increments.
