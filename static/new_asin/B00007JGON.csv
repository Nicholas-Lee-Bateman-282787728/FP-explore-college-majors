1811878,4,B00007JGON,"At first glance, this film might seem rather ordinary, plot coverage of the important events related to the end of the end of the Edwardian era and the Victorian Dynasty in Europe, but it is really about the very human struggles of the English monarchy at the time.  The desire of the mentally and physically challenged Prince John to be part of the world his parents George V and Queen Mary have ostracized him from lies at the heart of this film.  Around John struggle his nanny, Lalla (Gina McKee), who strives for John's acceptance by his parents; his mother, Queen Mary (Miranda Richardson), who clings to the dignity her own mother was so lacking in; his father George V (Tom Hollander), who feels dwarfed by his position and the demands of loyalty to family and country.  It is obvious the film was painstakingly researched, but history is only the backdrop here against which a drama of love, rejection, and loss play out to an inevitable conclusion.  This film was touching in a way few historical dramas are and I think the focus on John, who most likely suffered from autism and epilepsy, is the reason.  I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in British history.",1098576000,11,1186,4.6826923076923075
1811879,5,B00007JGON,"For his latest television film, Stephen Poliakoff has dusted off some skeletons from the Royal Family closet, given them flesh through a well researched, literate script and dressed them, beautifully, in all the finery of late Edwardian era; his real triumph, though, is in breathing life into what could have been mere historical zombies.
""The Lost Prince"" tells the tale of the Royals from the time of Edward VII, and the zenith of Britain's Imperial splendour, through to the Gotterdammerung of the First World War and the smashing of the royal houses of Europe on the battlefield. Where Poliakoff's account departs from others is in telling the story largely through the eyes of a child: Prince Johnny, the epileptic, possibly autistic (and thought to be `imbecile') youngest son of George V and Queen Mary. For Johnny, hidden away in the country where he cannot embarrass his parents, the unfolding of one of the most tumultuous periods in European history is a surreal family melodrama populated by larger-than-life relatives like Czar Niki and Kaiser Willy.
Pretty well abandoned by his parents, Johnny's main contact with the world is through his nurse, Lalla, and brother Georgie---better known as the Duke of Kent, whose death in a 1942 plane crash along with the `real' Rudolf Hess still has tongues wagging---Poliakoff also lifts the lid on who was really responsible for abandoning the Romanovs to their fate (and it wasn't Lloyd George).
With great performances from the likes of Tom Hollander (as George V), Michael Gambon (as Edward VII), and Miranda Richardson (as Queen Mary)---not to mention the children who bring young Johnny and Georgie to life---splendid cinematography, a suitably bittersweet Elgarian score and an approach to staging the past that gets beyond the cosmetic pleasures of much costume drama, this is a wonderfully satisfying, elegiac piece of work. A perfect piece of historical drama, no less.",1078358400,94,1933,5.178913738019169
1811890,5,B00007JGON,"This is the kind of historical movie you don't see enough of-- accurate and sensitive to character, with good dialogue. Part 2 will make you cry and has some violence. I don't recommend kids watching this. The presentations of Alexandra of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm are both a little cheesy and hostile, but otherwise this is an amazing show. Worth the money.",1473552000,,359,4.806451612903226

1811893,3,B00007JGON,"Very sad story about a little boy that was, while loved hidden away because he wasn't quite up to the family standards.  It is rather like not politically acceptable for a royal family.  The Czar of Russia, who was his cousin was not treated like this little Prince.  Very sad.",1465084800,,277,4.5
1811894,5,B00007JGON,As a buff of British history and the royal families I was surprised that I knew nothing about this young prince. Born into an era when royal children were raised by nannies this poor soul was lucky to have a devoted nanny who comforted his short life. Like the Kennedy sister that was not quite right he was hidden away from the public eye so as not to embarrass the family.,1462665600,,374,4.28169014084507
1811895,5,B00007JGON,A very sad but true tale of a charming little boy treated by his parents as an outcast because he had epilepsy.  His life was short but before he died at 13 he was loved and cherished by his Nanny and the ordinary people around him.  The play has a wonderful cast of wellknown faces and is sympathetically directed by Stephen Poliakoff.  Recommended for any student of the British Royal family's far from loving behaviour to anyone who is different.,1457222400,3,449,4.5875
1811896,5,B00007JGON,"This is a great film put out by the BBC.  It is a true story about the youngest member of the British Monarchy during WWI and the Russian Revolution.  He was Prince Johnnie .  His father was George V and his mother was Queen Mary.  From an early age he was prone to epileptic fits and the royal doctors diagnosed him as being mentally challenged who should be kept away from the royal family as an embarrassment.

The truth slowly emerges, with the help of his nurse and nanny Lalla, that he may be quite intelligent in his own way, and it was her goal to prove this fact to his parents, and in particular to his mother, played marvelously by Miranda Richardson, whose inclination was to ignore him and his issues rather than find out his true potential.

This is truly a wonderfully made-for-televison movie which restores this forgotten, but wonderfully gifted child, back to his place in the history of the British Monarchy in an most entertaining and illuminating fashion.",1456099200,3,976,4.645348837209302
1811897,5,B00007JGON,A masterful movie that is well acted and directed.,1454198400,,50,4.666666666666667
1811898,5,B00007JGON,"This film is a fascinating glimpse into the tragic story of a young prince whose story deserves to be remembered.  Prince John, who would have been the uncle of the current queen of England had he lived, suffered from brutal epileptic seizures that increased in intensity and frequency as he grew older, eventually killing him at the age of 14.  He was kept out of the public eye due to his ""infirmities""; the royal family simply couldn't handle the embarrassment.  Although his mother, Queen Mary, was distant, his beloved La-la (his nanny) was a constant loving presence in his life.  The film makes much of the contrast between the secluded but comfortable life of Prince John and that of his brother, Prince Georgie, who was sent to a naval training academy at a young age.  The misery of the intelligent and sensitive Georgie at the academy (bullying, daily ice water baths) is juxtaposed against the serene days of gardening and listening to music enjoyed by Prince John.
The film has something for everyone.  Costume drama lovers will find the story of the secluded young prince sad and poignant.  War buffs will be entranced by the story of the events leading to WWI. (the Romanovs were cousins of the family, and they are heavily featured in the film.)  Fans of the royal family will enjoy the story about how the House of Windsor got its name as well as the glimpses into a time when the power of the monarchy was becoming diminished in favor of the Prime Minister and the Houses of Parliament.  This film was both entertaining and educational...well worth watching.",1454112000,,1576,4.764705882352941

1811912,4,B00007JGON,"A poignant story.  The movie takes some liberties with the facts, but it's a nice little piece.  It does show the rigid life the aristocracy was locked into.  Put against the contemporary story of Princess Diana and her miserable life with the royals, one can almosty have sympathy for them.",1442361600,,291,4.78

Four stars because it succeeds in its own right and is totally satisfying for what it is and claims to be; not because it can be compared with the truly great movies that would earn four stars relative to all others.",1440115200,,387,4.542857142857143

1811916,5,B00007JGON,"This is a good show about the lost prince of England who died very young.  Because he was seen as defective , he was not embraced by his parents ,however in those days , people with autism or such were often sent to asylums sadly.  We get a well acted drama here in which the sad story of this child is told.  It moves very quickly the dvd looks great picture wise. It's a heartbreaking story and it's easy to condemn the royal couple but the past was very cruel often to poor kids like this.  Doctors often told parents to forget about them and move on.  Social Darwinism was very popular and that meant the survival of the fittest.  This show takes place during the early 20th century , which is not  time of great compassion for those like the lost prince.  You will be moved by this story and be thankful that we have come so far in dealing with such children today.  The acting here is very good and the BBC really shines here.",1436054400,,932,4.220338983050848

1811930,5,B00007JGON,"I clearly remember, when Queen Mary died in 1953, my own mother commenting that SHE had been the true embodiment of a queen. Well, if by that she meant a cold, rigid, humorless woman, more concerned with public perception than she was about her own children, then I would have to agree. This movie, wonderfully produced and acted, does not help Mary's reputation, or that of her equally cold and indifferent royal husband, George V. If we are expected to believe their attitudes were a product of their time, we need look no further than the current queen's reaction....or lack thereof, in the wake of the death of Princess Diana in 1997, more than 80 years after the events depicted in this movie. It is, however, a wonderful insight into the inner workings of the world's most famous royal family, and a very poignant exploration of the tragic life of an obscure member of that family.",1430352000,,887,4.6923076923076925

1811936,5,B00007JGON,This is such a sad movie that really opens your eyes about how some people who had certain illnesses back then and even today can easily just be locked away and it just doesn't seem to phase the family including the parents. Very sad movie but very good.,1418342400,,254,4.3125
1811937,5,B00007JGON,"A quality film with a rich cast, set, costume, and historical value. Sadly enough this young prince was cloistered for and illness that was out of his control. Amazing at what was hidden, or kept from public view in those days.",1418083200,,227,4.560975609756097

Very interesting topic, I had never heard of this young prince before and the history behind it and the Romanov connection was fascinating. A must see!",1412812800,,272,4.934782608695652

1811943,5,B00007JGON,"If you're looking for action, this isn't for you.  The pace is consistently slow.  But the tension builds steadily -- impending war (eventually realized) along with the obvious issue of the king and queen's virtual abandonment of their youngest son.

But slow movies have their place, and this is an excellent one.  I was fascinated with the background look at the European royal families' interconnections, and how those relationships were affected by the threat of war.

This was a sad movie, for several reasons.  But my wife and I loved it.",1409875200,,544,4.923076923076923

1811946,5,B00007JGON,Not only does it appear to be about a boy with autism and epilepsy there is a lot of history going on at the same time as well as some behind the war scenes (not sure how accurate these are in particular...we can only assume based on historical findings) but the way it plays out is very well done.,1401235200,,298,4.067796610169491
1811947,5,B00007JGON,What an interesting story and so well done.  Really gives a lot of insight not only into this family but the history of Europe during that time.  Great ending!!,1398124800,,160,4.482758620689655
1811948,5,B00007JGON,"While I think that some artistic liberty may have been taken with this movie, I did enjoy watching it. It relates a true story about a price that was hidden from view due to his differences. It does relate the opinion people had of children or adults that learned differently or were considered retarded. Worth the watch!",1397692800,,321,4.649122807017544

1811962,4,B00007JGON,"Very poignant and informative.  I never knew that the child had existed, and I was surprised to discover that people born and raised in England did not know anything either about the prince.  I only wish the producer and the director had shown what happened after he died:  whether his funeral was public or kept a secret.  Beautiful photography, especially when the Czar and his family are present, and beautiful example of how the last Czarina was insensitive and self-centered; actually, we learn more about the Czarina's personality in one scene, than about the prince's mother during the whole movie.",1388016000,,605,5.02

1811969,4,B00007JGON,"If you like late Victorian era history with a human touch you are going to like this one. Set in a period of time just before WWI; it's a story of an adorable child who is hid away simply because he was royalty and had an affliction. Against the backdrop of an historical time which ends in the destruction of the beautiful old order - the English royal family confronts its own crises and in many ways fails. What is ironic in the movie is the comparison it makes between the Czar of Russia , Nicholas and the way he treats his family versus the English king George V - Nicki's cousin - treatment of his family. The Czar obviously puts his family first - not hiding Alexi away because of his medical condition, the English king loves his position first and lets his own son be placed out of sight. Ironic, because one Father lost his life for love of family the other kept it by disowning his own.

1812003,4,B00007JGON,"I found this film tastefully done and historically accurate. Watching it makes one appreciate--among other things-- the privilege of being born a commoner. The addition of a brief but pithy epilogue showing more of the historical and social context would've been helpful to make the theme even clearer. But the dialogue and acting were excellent. The rather slow pace of the story gives viewers an opportunity to reflect on the significant convergence of events revolving around Prince Johnnie. If I were teaching a class on English Literature or History, I would use this film as a teaching tool for its authentic portrayal of the period with its special impact upon Modern History.",1346889600,,683,5.107142857142857
1812004,3,B00007JGON,"This is the story of Prince John of England, who had epilepsy and was kept out of the public eye to the extent possible. The story opens when John is 4, and Grandpapa (Edward VII) is staging butter pat races down his long black boots while the children each choose one to be their ""horse"" in the race. John decides they are all his.

John had his first seizure at about that time, and to avoid his being too conspicuous, he is taken to Sandringham House, and eventually to an isolated farm on the estate where he lived with his nurse/nanny called Lalla. Doctors had said he was brain damaged and incapable of learning, and his tutor grew terribly frustrated with him, but eventually Lalla taught him quite a lot. But once his father became King George V, and especially once the war in Europe tied the royal family up in knots (remember that they were cousins to quite a few of the other European royals, not to mention Tzar Nicholas II), he rarely saw either his father or Queen Mary, his mother. His older brother George did visit, however, and they were pretty close.

The one thing that bothered me about the movie, which was well done generally, was that George was at least a couple of years older than John, but when they switched actors to the older versions of them, George is shorter and slighter than John. Perhaps that was true, but if so, some mention of the reality would have helped me remember that George was older than John.

All in all, a well-made movie about a not all that interesting a character. It was originally a BBC presentation, and is three hours long in two segments.",1336867200,,1598,4.484536082474227

His story, that of his parents and the historical context of his life made for a very interesting movie.  How I cried when it was over!  Highly recommend!

1812008,5,B00007JGON,"As an Anglophile, I've watched lots of documentaries and films on British Royal families.  What comes through to me over and over again is that although the royal parents may love their royal children, showers of love and affection are simply ""not done.""  The children are raised by nannies, governesses and other support staff.  They are then shipped off to far reaches of the kingdom and slapped into various boarding schools.

The Lost Prince is about Prince Johnnie, son of George V and Mary, who has at the very least epilepsy and some learning difficulties.  As was the custom of the day, such frailties were kept secret from one's subjects (his cousin Alexei Romanov's haemophilia was never public knowledge either).  In Prince Johnnie's case, he was hidden away from public view and finally removed from his family entirely, presumably to maintain public trust in the strength of the dynasty.

As sad his life may appear to us 21st century types, I am left wondering if Johnnie didn't have the better deal than the rest of his siblings.  He was loved and adored by his nannies.  He spent his time living in a world of his own design, while maintaining a tether to his surroundings and the people in it.  I look at his two most famous brothers, Edward and George VI and I have to believe Johnnie had a happier (albeit short) life.

Was his life and situation poignant? Yes, absolutely! But, in the years after Johnnie's death, would anyone have wanted to trade places with his more famous brothers, Edward and George VI?  Neither had the tools or emotional confidence to face the challenges that nearly crushed them separately.  Johnnie on the other hand spent his last days tilting at windmills and romping in the English countryside.

Children with disabilities have been treated so inhumanely, due in part to parental helplessness, ignorance and shame.  Johnnie, however, was lucky; instead of being locked away in an asylum or lobotomized like Rosemary Kennedy, his parents simply made him disappear - into his own world.

I don't agree with their choice at all, but given that up until Princes William and Harry, the main sources of love for British princes appears to have been hired help and not from the parents, little Johnnie did okay.

The Lost Prince is a lovely movie that will touch you immensely - at least it did me.",1323388800,6,2339,4.793017456359102

1812010,2,B00007JGON,"I very much looked forward to receiving and watching this DVD, being a great fan of historical films in general, and pre-current-day British royalty in particular.
I was, alas, VERY disappointed.

The main problem was that the it was about 3 times as long as it needed to be.  There is relatively little actually known about Prince John or his life or disabilities, which meant that we got a lot of images of John gazing into space  and wandering the halls,(little more, I suspect could be expected of the young actor playing the younger John), repeated apologies from his nurse to Queen Mary that she'd let him wander off, and a great deal of irrelevant (to the story, anyway) and equally uninteresting material dealing with his parents and cousins.  The ending was utterly abrupt. (Not to spoil anything but --- he was playing. He died.)

Historically there was also much to wonder about.  Watching the film one would assume that Johnny had only one brother. The older siblings were seen VERY briefly  in a couple of early scenes, and mentioned in passing at the end, but beyond that, we only ever saw Georgie.  Dream images of the Russian grand-duchesses got more screen-time than Johnnie's real family. We got a detailed family tree (as the boys looked out the window before Edward's funeral) of many of  their cousins who were kings and emperors of other nations, while other characters (Prime Ministers, ""Fat Mary"") came and went with barely  a hint to their actual identities. This was especially problematic since the actors in the roles rarely had more than the most passing resemblances to their real-life counterparts. I ASSUME that the royal lady in one of the early scenes fretting about her shoes was the Tsarina .. but it was never made clear.  Nor was the relevance of the scene. The actor playing Kaiser Wilhelm (again, questionably referred to in the film as 'Cousin Bill' -- I've never seen or read any indication that he was known as anything but ""Willie"" to his English relations -- though if anyone can correct me this I'll stand properly chastened) was much too young.
 Surely the Queen would have addressed Lalla as ""Mrs. Bill"", at least during formal meetings -- the position of head nurse in a royal household was one of considerable respect and importance. Known history also indicates that the complete separation of Johnny from the family didn't occur until the move to the farm in 1917. Before that he accompanied the rest of the family on moves between royal households and was seen by visitors and guests and his parents and siblings.

Again, very disappointing. I'd hoped to learn more about this admittedly shadowy figure of Edwardian history ... and instead got a glossy 3 hour bit of nothingness.",1318118400,8,2732,4.82441113490364

The entire series illustrates life in Europe prior to World War I, when all the ruling families were related to one another. Especially enjoyable was the scene when Queen Alexandra mused that the war could be ended if her son, King George V, her nephew, Tsar Nicholas II, and her other nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm, (known in the family as Georgie, Nicky, and Willy) could get together as a family and talk.

The innocence of Prince John and his daydreams about his family coming to live in house are typical of any young child. The only difference is Prince John's family encompasses all the the ruling families of Europe.

As an educator of children with special needs, I know the importance of the feeling of ""being just like everyone else."" Prince John's being able to stand in front of his family and perform, just like his siblings, was the most poignant and touching scene of the entire series.

My wife, however, has lived in London so we end up watching a number of British-related DVDs on the telly as late night entertainment. Several items regarding the Royal Family have come up lately and one is ""The Lost Prince.""

The story is almost three-hours long and is split into two parts. It involves the somewhat retarded and epileptic son of Queen Mary and King George V and takes place at about the onset of WW I. It's a wonderful period piece, without question, and a very sad story. One just cannot feel anything but deep sorrow for the boy. The acting is first rate, although a bit too stiff-upper-lipped for my tastes, and the costumes and settings are marvelous. It's so long that we split the viewing into two nights, which worked out very well. It's an excellent movie, no matter what your feelings might be regarding royal families.

There were times when I wanted to just shake his mother. His father was clueless and I didn't think even shaking him would have done much good. I loved Georgie, Prince John's older brother.

1812045,5,B00007JGON,"AS AN ANGLOPHILE, AND ""ROYALFILE"", I had come across the name of
""Prince John"", the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary, in som of my readings on the Windsors -- but the descriptions of him were usually no more than a name, or perhaps a statement that he was both retarded and had epilepsy.  I had also read that he had his own home, away from the rest of the royal family, and was looked after by a devoted lady-servant named ""Lala"", and had died at the age of 13.  I had seen a picture of him as an infant, (before his illnesses were discovered), happily sitting on his mother's lap...and he sure didn't look retarded to me.  I suppose, had I looked futher, I might have gained more knowledge, just by reading, about this ""lost prince"".  However, this fascinating TV Movie filled in just about every gap for me.  I am very glad I saw it, and very, very glad it was produced!

The time period here is gracefully reproduced, as are all the leading people in Prince John's small world.  These consisted mostly of his family, and Lala, his attendant.  I had not known that his brother, Prince George, (later to become the Duke of Glouchester -- pronounced ""Glous-ter""), was the only one in his family to take a personal interest in Prince John.  It was fascinating and enlightening to see the two little royal brothers together, and also heart-breaking to realize the rest of Prince John's family hardly cared for him at all.

One of the most memorable parts of this film was the visit of the Romanov cousins to England.  The four daughters flitted around
Prince John like winged fairies -- smiling, enchanting, and beautiful.  The silent meetng of Prince John with the Czarivitch -- almost the same age, and also with a handicap kept secret from most people -- was unforgettable.  How I wished the two of them had had more time to be together!  How I wished even more, that the customs of that tume had NOT been to regard handicaps, (especially in Royal Families), as shameful, and something to be kept hidden.  Had the real BRAVERY of both the Czarivitch, and Prince John, in confronting their illnesses, been SHOWN to the public at large, it would have ENDEARED these princes to the public, and not shamed or horrified them.  The Russian Revolution might even ave been prevented, had the Czarvitch's illness, (and his brave fighting of it), been known.  Certainly, Prince John would have lived a more normal, (and probably much longer), life.
Yet, even in 1940s, such almost-medieval attitudes towards illness prevailed -- witness the carefull keeping-from-the-public of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's polio, at that time.  Thank goodness times have changed!  But they changed too late for poor Prince John.

This is a movie to be watched by all: Royalists, those with illnesses, their families, and the public at large.  In this movie, Prince John is shown to be a quite normal little boy, who DID have epilepsy, but who's retardation -- if any -- was extremely and very minor.  Had he grown, he might have had a special insight into ""ordinary"" people's problems, and been able to connect with them more -- thus not only making ""ordinary"" people happy, but also strengthening their bond, (and allegience!), to the Royal family.  As it was -- he died at the age of 13, (the same age as, a few years earlier, his cousin, the Czarivitch had died, though from very different causes.)

It was over three-quarters-of-a-century, from the time Prince John died, to the time this movie was made. A little long in coming...but certainly worth the wait.  Charming, historical, and devasting, this movie will remain with the viewer for a long, long time, after he or she has seen it!  A ""must-view"" movie for everyone!",1253750400,5,3718,4.71671826625387

Sharp, detailed, colorful high-def edition of the original 1.78:1 negative with a subtle and clearly defined DTS HD soundtrack. Big step up versus the terrible DVD. This BBC blu-ray is region free and therefore playable in US blu-ray players.

The movie tells about his condition and his faithful nanny Charlotte Bill, known in the family as ""Lalla."" The production has other historical facts in the movie. Tells why and how the royal family changed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor during WWI.

1812081,5,B00007JGON,"I loved this film. The depiction of the young Prince John was historically as well as clinically accurate. He was an epilectic child and certainly showed signs of genuine Aspergers Syndrome. The touching relationship between the prince and his beloved Nanny Lalla Bill was extraordinary. This was a woman who devoted her entire being to the care and love and education of this young boy. She quickly realized his penchant for music and nurtured it in a way that he was able to emotionally grow and feel joy through his music. She was so proud of his achievents, even though they were gained with baby steps. The mores and values of the Edwardian years were certainly portrayed accurately by the writer and director of this film. They managed to intertwine a very complicated family history and struggle of the Sax-Coburg-Gotha family and their relationship with the Romonov's including the downfall and murder of many family members. King George V's relationship with the Tsar was brought to bare and the eventual assassination of the russian royal family was a heartbreak. The effect that this war had on the royal family and on Prince John in particular was artistically written and brought to the screen in this brilliant and touching film. I highly recommend it.",1179532800,5,1266,4.948356807511737
1812082,5,B00007JGON,"Having no idea how historically accurate it is, The Lost Prince still touched me. Such a sad story, on so many levels.

The boys playing John are remarkably fresh actors (especially the younger of the two, who seems to play epileptic fits convincingly). Lalla the nurse is compassionate and loving, but unable to get most of John's family to pay much attention to him. John's parents are 1) preoccupied with WWI, 2) severely limited by their roles as royals/regents, and 3) beyond eccentric in some of their actions. One can occasionally see the king and queen try, in their limited way, to reach out to their youngest son - and fail. John's brother George is a great friend, champion, and companion, but - as other reviewers have mentioned - lives an unhappy adult life and dies young. The doomed Russian imperial family are beautiful and haunting, with the Empress even more peculiar and domineering than I have read elsewhere. John's grandmother (Queen Alexandria) and grandfather (King Edward VII) are sympathetic to strange little John, but also remote.

Such a sad story - but beautifully told. I highly recommend it.",1173744000,8,1123,4.936507936507937

Georgie (after his older brother's abdication many years later) is to become George VI, and Johnnie, afflicted with epilepsy, is shunted away from public view as well as the company of his family, where he grows up under the care of a devoted retinue, then dies at the age of 14.

Poliakoff's scripting and direction make this story fragmented and starkly cool, representing life in the royal family's many residences as claustrophobic and its members as emotionally distant from each other. Georgie is the winning center of warmth and intelligence in the film, befriending a close aid of the king's (played wonderfully by Bill Nighy) and regarding his young brother with unwavering affection. Also at the center of the film is Johnnie's devoted caretaker (Gina McKee) who struggles unfailingly to find room for him in his parents' hearts.

Meanwhile, events in Europe have their inevitable impact as both king and queen succumb to the dark forces that seem ready to sweep across war-time Britain. And their cousins, the Emperor of Russia and his family, are assassinated while Britain hesitates to offer them refuge from the Bolshevik Revolution.

1812089,3,B00007JGON,"There was once a cute-but-dumpy German princess who became Queen of England because one of her relatives, who was King at the time, hadn't succeeded in fathering a child within the bounds of wedlock.  So she married one of her cousins, had many, many children (ten, to be exact)and after she had a son to inherit the family business, was left with the problem of what to do with the rest.

Marry them off the THEIR cousins--this exchange of bodily fluids made said Queen of England the center of an imperial web, but also meant that there were relatives We Don't Talk About.

Like one of the queen's great-grandchildren, Prince John, who was epileptic, possibly autistic, and considered to be an embarassment.  Unlike the Czar's son, he didn't bleed all over the winter tapestries, but he had a tendency to repeat things people said about each other and to have uncontrollable fits and so his parents, who weren't exactly affectionate with the kids who didn't have such conspicuous problems, banished him to a cottage on one of the royal estates and basically pretended that he didn't exist.  Queen Mary, his mother, was said to have regretted this in later years.  You wouldn't know it from looking at the photos.  Actually, you wouldn't know that she had any feelings, except some suggestions around the eyes that she laced her corset a bit tightly.

As long as this very long TV film sticks to the title character, it has some real emotional pull; Prince John may have had severe medical problems, but he was't a lush or drug addict or inclined to marry Mrs. Simpson (which might drive you towards the previously mentioned conditions), and he was loved, by a nanny who was referred to condescendingly by The Family as ""Lalla"" but who obviously was made of much finer stuff than her Betters.  But writer/director Stephen Poliakoff is ultimately too forgiving, the tenderness strays over to the awful parents George VI and Queen Mary and Goerge's degenerate father Edward VII (who was very fond of little girls--sort of in the manner that Humbert Humbert was).  The British Royals were, I suppose, marginally less stupid than their German and Russian cousins, but they were also protected by their constitutional powerlessness--in this case, they could point in all honesty to the idiot generals and say that it was all their fault--at least the military stuff.  But Queen Victoria's dynastic ambitions (Victory Through Incest)were the ultimate villain, and in that ugly mess, the British Royals were as implicated as anyone else.",1135468800,14,2531,4.917840375586854
1812090,5,B00007JGON,"I teach Special Education, and I know how hard it is for parents to raise children who are developementaly delayed or have behavior problems. The only time this is ever a ""problem"" is when the parents are so embarassed by their child that they ignore him/her completely. That's what happened to Prince John.

John Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (later changed to Windsor) is like the average child, except he has epilepsy and may also be mildly slow. This of course could have been the result of brain damage from the siezures, but it's never clear. Barred from the family circle, he views that ways of his father, the king, as an impartial observer. There's nothing but good in this kid; when his parents make him stand a good distance from a Royal beach party, he's happy to watch. When he sees the Tsar Nicholas swimming, he says ""he looks like an Emperor Fish."" His Russian cousins laugh, but his parents and brothers pretend he ain't there.

That is, except his closest brother.

John's older brother, with whom he was close in age, shared some good times with John. Unfortunately, he was the only one that cared. The rest of the family wasn't with him all his life, and they weren't the least bit miserable when he died. Why would they be? They formed no bond with their son durring his 14 years.

On a happier note.....

I don't know where they found the boys that play John as a child and adolescent, but they both deserve oscars. They nail the part head on, and they hold their own in the film. This is some of the best performance from child actors that I've seen in a long time.",1134172800,78,1576,4.515789473684211
1812111,5,B00007JGON,"The story of Prince John is largely unknown.  This production goes a long way towards letting the world know who he was and how he was seen by others and more importantly, how he saw the world during his short lifetime.  The acting is first rate and as a whole the film is well paced.  There are moments of high drama as well as mild humor - the meeting between Kaiser Wilhelm II and Prince John is one of the latter.  The ""solution"" to the Romanov question and how it is arrive at is of the former.

The whole story of Prince John's life is a little know chapter in the decades old story of Great Britain's Royal Family and as such is a valuable addition to the story.

I highly recommend this dvd to anyone with an interest in British and European history.",1125446400,8,758,4.229166666666667
1812112,4,B00007JGON,"This film was beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted and gorgeously scored, but be forewarned that the pace is ""leisurely"".  If you are bored by longer films like ""Out of Africa"" that take much time to develop characters and use cinematography and music to tell much of the story, then you might feel that the pace of this film drags too much (my wife fell asleep and, frankly, didn't care for the film).  But patience has its rewards and, if you can stick with it, the film tells a wonderful story, bringing to life a fascinating era of European and world history and reminding us of the things that are really important.  A 5-star film but for its very slow pace.  2 most poignant things to me:  (1) the contrasting emotions of the nanny and the mother upon Johnny's death, and (2) Georgie's statement at the end that ""Johnny was the only one of us that got to be himself.""  That perfectly summed up the whole movie.  A little slow, but a real gem.",1120521600,11,949,4.482558139534884
1812113,5,B00007JGON,"When I read a recent stock description that descibed the monarchy as ""heartless"" in relation to Prince John, I felt compelled to say that this is not an issue of ""heartless monarchy,"" as anyone familar with the time and subject undoubtedly knows. The Monarchy was acting in a way that simply underscored its core principles-- the young Prince's epilelpsy was a complete unknown in royal circles, and indeed, the most prudent advice (at the time) was taken. It is impled at several points in this film that historically cold-as-ice Queen Mary was confused and heartbroken over the separation and eventual loss of her son (though the same may not be said of the gruff and callous King George V).

More importantly, the far deeper foundation of this magnificent BBC piece is the decline and fall of both the European aristocracy and the British Empire as the new world order of the 20th Century began to form, sparked by WWI. Through the eyes of Pronce John a deeper shift is grasped-- and while he may not know it, we certainly do.

There is little evidence historically to suggest that the future Duke of Kent was so devoted to his young brother-- in fact, presumably due to schooling, The Prince of Wales, The Dukes of York and Gloucester and Princess Mary are all but absent. But for the sake of the plot, the young Duke of Kent adds an important human element-- as does governess Lalla, of whom little is known, but much is ascribed to here (and much liberty is taken with the enigmatic Lalla for the sake of the piece).

Still, this is a very accurate, very important piece of work. More than anyone, Miranda Richardson seems to capture Queen Mary with more dignity and repressed emotion (her hallmarks) than any actors I have seen.

In short, this is not a piece about ""cruel royalty,"" as the marketing would have you believe, with its very 21st century, post-Diana terms (the monarchy has always been heartless, it seems to imply). Far from it. This is a period piece marking a crucial time for the European aristocracy, and the allegory of John's death is really the death of the ""Old World,"" as defined by late Victorian and Edwardian England.

Truly a magnificent piece of work, though some basic knowledge of early Windsor history would add to the overall understanding and enjoyment of the piece.",1120348800,19,2306,4.72636815920398
1812114,5,B00007JGON,"The story of a very poorly Prince, who suffered what we would now call learning difficulties and epilepsy, he was much adored by his Mother, Queen Mary. Times dictated he was ""shut away"" to save face and keep prying eyes away. He lived most his short life in a purpose built house in royal grounds with a devoted Nanny. This film brings the story and it's contextual misery, vividly to life, the prince is played deliciously so as to display fragilty, vulnerability and misunderstanding in huge measure. Miranda Ricahrdson is fantastic as the pain racked Queen as is Gina Mackee is an intense and devoted Nanny.

It is difficult with modern eyes to see why this life was accepted but he film gives a great sense of the different time and the different value systems, morals and social order.

1812116,5,B00007JGON,"Masterpiece Theatre on KCET aired this two-part movie only weeks ago. It is a well-made and highly engaging historical movie with strong cast and touching human expression. Gina McKee (of the earlier ""Forsyte Saga"" series, plays the nanny and nurse to the sickly, epileptic and eternally childish Prince Johnnie, who was kept hidden from public eye during the years before World War I. The Royal Family of England, Queen Mary (played superbly by Miranda Richardson) and King George V, are portrayed with a human touch and do not come off as distant historical figures. The movie is rather long but worth watching. Prince Johnnie is treated as the hero of the movie, as the voice of reason, despite his illness and his position as the weak one. The plot follows historical fact accurately. European monarchy was shaken off its foundation with the outbreak of World War I. King Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assasinated by Gavrilo Princip, a radical, and war erupted. Further revolutions in Russia as the Communists take over and slaughter the Romanov family- Czar Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their daughters including Anastasia. This movie has beautiful locations, cinematography and a great musical score. Other than the original music for the film, excerpts from classical music are presented as Johnnie listens to a phonograph, among the works he hears is Beethoven's  Symphony No. 7 finale- the allegro con brio. A great movie. On DVD, there is commentary by the director Stephen Poliakoff and insight on the time period of World War I ""The King, The Kaiser and the Czar"", a look at the three powers in Europe- the king of England, the German Kaiser Wilhelm and the Czar, who all make appearances within the context of the film.",1101600000,18,1745,4.9965635738831615
1812117,5,B00007JGON,"This is a very touching tale of a lost 'footnote' from history - some histories of the British royal family come with handy genealogy charts, showing the progress of royals through the ages in graphic format.  Often, the younger children, the 'also rans' of the royal story, are left off the charts, unless they attained fame some other way, or unless they married well.  For those royal children who died in infancy or childhood, history is most unkind - they aren't even in the footnotes or indices.  Such is often the case for young Prince John - born with a disability that presented like epilepsy, he was (according to the custom of the time) kept out of the public eye.  Being rather low on the pecking order, he likely never would have attracted much attention, but with his disability, in a world that did not quite know how to regard those with disabilities, he was indeed an outcast, however royal.

The teleplay shows an interplay of the private life of Prince John and his caregivers, particularly the deeply devoted servant and nanny, Lalla, and the public life of the royal family, as their lives became increasingly complex and involved in public duties due to the outbreak of the first world war.  The private life concentrates both on John and Lalla, as well as John and George, another of the younger royal children, close in age to John.  George went through the typical royal upbringing of boarding schools with a military emphasis; he was as out-of-place in that world as John was in the stuffy, rigidly-controlled royal world.  The camaraderie between George and John was touchingly portrayed in two different age brackets - one of early childhood (Daniel Williams playing John, and Brock-Everitt-Elwick playing George), and one of early adolescence (Matthew Thomas playing John, and Rollo Weeks playing George).  John, with his lack of inhibitions and oversized features (part of his disability) would occasionally make a truthful-if-not-quite-diplomatic statement, sometimes to a visiting royal, sometimes to the Prime Minister or other such dignitary.

John's expression in life was done through art, music, and physical movements and expression.  He made paintings that showed a rather unique way of looking at the world, often over-emphasising details (such as crowns).  He also cared passionately for his gardens, working for hours at a time among the flowers and other plants.  Lalla (lovingly portrayed by Gina McKee) encouraged him, seeing in him more substance that doctors could with their brief examinations, and more than could his own parents, who rarely exhibited affection to John (or each other, or anyone else).

It was a tense time in the world.  King George V (Tom Hollander) and his wife, the regal and inflexible Queen Mary (Miranda Richardson) tried desperately to navigate through a world becoming distinctly unfriendly toward royalty; just a generation prior, their family through Victoria's connections reigned in almost every major and many minor countries in Europe, which at that time through colonialism dominated the world; by the end of World War II, few monarchies were left, and those that were had no power or authority of their own.  One of the mistakes of the monarchs, brought out in this teleplay, was the assumption that they still had power.  In actual fact, they rarely even had influence.

The scenes with the Russian royal family are interesting to note the similarities and differences between the ideas of royalty; the political leaders, too, are portrayed in somewhat flat but interesting characterisations.  Yet, as one other commentator has mentioned, the truly outstanding moment of the drama comes near the end, when John gets to give his performance for the family, and causes the family to reflect on their fortunes - after all, they were still there, silly.  Unlike the Russian royals, dead from the revolutionaries; unlike the German and Austrian royals, driven from office by the war; unlike countless other royal persons throughout Europe, dead or in exile from the aftermath, the British royal family (with its newly-minted British name) survived intact, if not in power.  One does indeed doubt the historicity of John's final performance for the family, but one can hope that it, or something like it, did indeed occur.

The sets, costumes, and music are very well crafted and appropriately selected for this teleplay.  This is a programme I shall revisit again and again.  Despite all life's troubles, after all, we're still here, silly.",1101168000,15,4519,5.108695652173913

Someone who really stuck out for me was Rollo Weeks, who plays Prince George in the film...",1099353600,6,295,4.6923076923076925
1812119,5,B00007JGON,"Now that I have finally seen both episodes of The Lost Prince I can say confidently that it is one of the best Masterpiece Theater presentations in many years.  As the story of Prince John, the youngest child of King George V and Queen Mary of Great Britain, it is heartbreakingly evocative of the tragedy of one child and of the loss of  an entire world.

The first episode opens with Prince John at about the age of three or four.  He is epileptic and probably autistic, handicaps which no one knew how to deal with effectively at the time and which were especially difficult to handle for a Royal on public display much of the time.  His family is fond of him but emotionally distant, and the only real love John receives is from his nurse Lalla and his next older brother Georgie.  Most of the time John is kept out of sight, though occasionally he gets to watch Royal occasions like the visit of the Russian Imperial Family to England (among the most beautiful of the scenes in this film, the Grand Duchesses and the Empress being elegant and charming) and the funeral of his grandfather Edward VII.  His parents are so bound up with their royal duties and conscious of their dignity that they can't unbend enough to risk being with Johnnie too often.  (With Queen Mary we are given an explanation for her apparent unfeelingness when we are shown glimpses of her own difficult and embarrassing childhood as the daughter of a very large and very undignified Princess.) Johnnie's handicaps make him refreshingly natural and spontaneous, which embarrasses his family when, for example, he repeats some unflattering comments he has overheard the Prime Minister make about the Royals. The first episode ends with the outbreak of World War I and Johnnie's removal to the countryside.

In the second episode Johnnie is safely ensconced at a farm near Sandringham with Lalla and a small retinue of servants.  He rarely sees his family, who are busier with royal duties than ever.  His main source of news and information is Georgie, who is a miserable cadet at the Royal Naval College.  Georgie witnesses Britain's conversion to a war footing and the development of chauvinistic super-patriotic anti-German feelings.  These lead to the Royal Family coming under attack for its German origins, and to the dynasty's renaming itself the House of Windsor.  We also see the fate of the Romanovs after the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917.  Although the British government at first agreed to accept the Romanovs as exiles, rising anti-monarchical sentiment in Britain so alarmed George V that he prevailed on his government to rescind the invitation.  This led to the eventual execution of the Romanovs and lifelong remorse by the King.

During these war years Johnnie lived a quiet life, roaming the countryside and planting gardens.  His parents saw him rarely and were as distant as ever.  Eventually, Lalla prevailed on the King and Queen to hear Johnnie give a recital.  One of the happiest parts of The Lost Prince comes when the King and Queen find themselves listening to and enjoying the company of their youngest son, gradually unbending and smiling as he plays the trumpet and kicks a football. Johnnie lived only a short time after the end of World War I, but the King and Queen carried his memory with them for the rest of their lives. By the way, it may be of interest to know that his brother Georgie, to whom Johnnie gave the courage to pursue his own artistic interests, had difficulties of his own in his twenties and thirties with drug addiction and sundry other problems, finally dying in a plane crash in 1942. This Georgie was not King George VI, the father of the present Queen.  George VI's original name was Albert (Bertie) and he appears only as an extra in this film.

The Lost Prince is a beautiful production.  Extreme royal aficionados will notice a few missteps (the Romanovs may have been Russian Royals, but they didn't have Russian accents the way this film portrayed them.  If anything, Nicholas and Alexandra and their children  had British accents!) but these are mere fumbles in the delivery of a beautiful and evocative series.",1098662400,252,4161,4.794117647058823
1812120,4,B00007JGON,"We have seen plenty of treatments of the Edwardian era and World War I, including a number from a child's perspective, but none with the perspective that one will find here.  Prince John (1905-1919), sheltered from public view due to a variety of ailments (including epilepsy & possibly a form of autism), drifts through his brief life unaffected and undisturbed by the tumult surrounding him.

One reviewer scored this production for its sloppy editing, as the scenes appear to be jumbled together.  There is something to that criticism.  If you do not know the period well, you may be confused as to what year it is, not to mention who all of the royal relatives may be.  Every now and then, one gets a point of reference (death of Edward VII, assassination of Franz Ferdinand) that will tell you what year it is, but then you find that the scene has abruptly shifted to 2 years later.  This was a little disconcerting & may be the result of sloppy editing, but I am inclined to think that this was by design.  For a child cut off from world events, where every day consists of the same routine, the years might very well blur together after awhile.

Aside from Prince John, a great deal of the action centered around his older brother, (the future Duke of Kent) Prince George (1902-1942), whose perspective is considerably different than that of his brother.  Condemned to be the only smart one in a family of relative dullards, Prince George feels most keenly the inability of his parents to deal effectively with much of anything at all, whether it is John's situation or matters of state.  At the film's conclusion, he almost envies his brother for being able to live his life on his own terms, and not give a damn what anyone else thinks.

The performances are first rate.  Miranda Richardson is superb as Queen Mary, who clearly is torn between her duties as Queen and her wishes to be more attentive and supportive of her family.  Tom Hollander evokes sympathy as the hapless George V, who is all too aware of his limitations as a monarch and father & is considerably frustrated by it.  Shining through above all others is Gina McKee, who many may recall from ""The Forsyte Saga"" (in a role that I personally felt had her horribly miscast).  She may not have worked well as Irene Forsyte, but she was most moving as the wholy devoted nanny Lalla, who so cares about John's well-being that she is willing to endure a near-decade of virtual exile.  It appears that Lalla is unwilling to admit fully to herself the true nature of John's disabilities, continuing to insist that John is ""doing so much better.""  Her own world ultimately becomes more removed from reality than that of John himself.

This is the ultimate irony of John's life, and we see it throughout the film.  He was shielded from public view to protect the royal family from potential embarrassment, but this same seclusion ultimately serves to protect John from his own family & their inadequecies.  Though largely forgotten by history, nonetheless he is the one who emerges most unscathed and uncompromised.",1098662400,22,3081,4.712686567164179

It shows Prince John 's family members from his loving Grandparents, his brother and best friend Prince George, his caring nanny ""La-La,""  his parents King George the V, and his well-meaning Mother Queen Mary.  It's a very bitter-sweet story of how Prince John coped with epilepsy, and learning impairments while retaining his personality and just being himself.

This also shows the British, Russian, and German Royal Families handling World War 1, and the eventual destruction of the Russian and German Royal Family.
