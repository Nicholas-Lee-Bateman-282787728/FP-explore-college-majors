2326791,1,B0009W5KDQ,"Dude i rented this movie and I still feel ripped off the acting is terrible and the special effects look like they were done in photoshop, it mostly takes place in what to me looks like a costcos warehouse and the dude on the cover isn't even in the movie it stars sum out of shape dude runnin around armed with nothin but plastic daggers and bad acting its a miracle that this garbage was ever released DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!! unless your willing to laugh at how terrible this thing is.",1127088000,3,487,4.247311827956989
2326792,3,B0009W5KDQ,"I was expecting a Blade rip-off but what I got instead was alot more. If only Blade Trinity half this entertaining. Calling this low budget is a false comparison. Low on money but heavy on heart, the director tries to create an interesting story besides just fight sequences. I found myself very interested in Derek and his pursuit of Vampire Slovak and I cannot wait to see what this director will do once he gets some real support. Good story,questionable acting,bad editing(especially action sequences),but a lot of heart. Well Done.",1124928000,6,536,4.966666666666667
2326793,1,B0009W5KDQ,"i can not believe that this is a real movie. i can not believe that lions gate would put their name on a joke like this. it is cheep and nothing went into. it is maybe worth a joke. 11 year olds with home video cameras have made better movies than this. the sound is off, the lighting sucks, the location is a crappy house and the actors act worse than soap stars. anyway, i just cant believe it... i feel like i have been punked.

2326794,1,B0009W5KDQ,"Clearly an attempt to rip-off the Blade series - black vampire hunter, samurai sword fights and martial arts. Very little vampirism.

The problem for this film is that the points above are done so very badly. Terribly sequenced fight scenes. Vampires with plastic store-bought teeth.",1124323200,5,283,5.288888888888889

8067972,1,B0009W5KDQ,"The seller performed perfectly. This review is about the movie. It is so bad, it has become a thing. You can Google it.",1424736000,,119,4.217391304347826
8067973,5,B0009W5KDQ,"This is one of those movies that's sooooo terrible, it's best if you want a good laugh. For the best experience possible, gather a group of your friends and have a good time picking this movie apart. Drinks optional hehe.",1400544000,2,221,4.55
8067974,1,B0009W5KDQ,This movie was horribly made. I feel like I could have grabbed some buddies and made a better one with moviemaker. Plot was horrible. Acting bad. Just don't get it. Not worth the DVD it is on.,1319328000,,192,4.216216216216216
8067975,1,B0009W5KDQ,"I love cheesy movies, movies who are so bad that they are good, well this movie is just so bad that it is horrible. The acting is the worst I have ever seen, the special effects are pathetic, and the storyline is weak. The movie looks and feel like a home made YouTube project made by a few bored friends, and not the kind of YouTube film where passion and creativity go into doing the best with what one have, but more the kind where one is just board and messing around with a camera. I can not believe this movie got published.

The plot of this movie is one man who desires to take down this powerful vampire leader, why he want to do that, it is in the badly written plot somewhere but I just could not force myself to care. As  result there is allot of badly choreographed fighting and retarded one liners. Now some say this is a Blade ripoff, it is not, they might have tried to rip of Blade, but seriously, a Blade clone would be somewhat good, this film is just a mess.",1290643200,2,978,4.1421052631578945
8067976,1,B0009W5KDQ,"Oh my God, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Low-budget vampire hunters who don't even use half the weapons portrayed on the cover. The vampire-killing scenes suck, as when a vampire is staked, lightning comes out of the body. Skip over this one for sure.",1215475200,,269,4.510204081632653
8067977,1,B0009W5KDQ,Ron Hall is obviously very well trained in the martial arts field but this film's low budget effects and poorly written dialogue takes my attention away from this action/horror genere film. This film was very poorly edidited and one of characters in this film made me want to cheer when his fate came about. I have seen worse effects in a film but obviously this is a very poor try to make this look like an A grade feature film. A dollar maybe too much for this film unless you are planning just to watch and poke fun of this film.,1202601600,2,532,4.2772277227722775
8067978,5,B0009W5KDQ,"this movie was mabey the most entertaining movie i have ever seen! Not because it was an actual good movie but because it completely sucked! Its written,directed,produced, and staring the same guy- Ron Hall!  Gearld Okamura's performance made the movie with random giggling and odd screching nosies , me and my friend were literally rolling on the floor laughing! I would recomened buying this movie used casue otherwise  its a complete waste of $15!  Buy this movie if u want to laugh ur gigglestick off at what could be the worst acting...ever! If ur into movies taht contain horrible acting and enjoy laughing at peoples attempt to act then we woud also recomend snakes on a train to! SO SAY THE PUMPKIN OVERLORDS!",1169337600,4,717,4.813008130081301
8067979,1,B0009W5KDQ,"Vampire Assassins was pretty much unwatchable. Unless torturing yourself is your bag, I seriously recommend skipping this. Don't get me wrong... I love vampire films, even the cheesy low-budget ones, but this film was so bad, it's difficult to describe. The first 10 minutes was really enough to turn me off...It was like watching a highschooler's first attempt using the vhs video-recorder.

AVOID this film unless one of your relatives is in it and you want good blackmail material for years to come.",1148428800,4,502,5.048192771084337
