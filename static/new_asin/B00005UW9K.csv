7955653,2,B00005UW9K,"A struggling ski lodge opts to go X-treme to attract a younger crowd, having not tried selling brightly colored overpriced lift tickets at a discount. This causes some rift between the current whiskey loving lodge manager (Nick Mancuso) and the young Lauren (Kirsten Robek) who has her eye on Alex (Wolf Larson) something ignored by her aging husband (Ed Marinaro). This aspect of the story was not well developed and the on screen chemistry didn't exist.

Kids want to snowboard in the off limits area of Avalanche Alley and you can guess the rest of film. For fans of X-treme sports, this film is not good in that regard either. This was a made for TV movie, but does include some adult language and themes. No F-bombs, but a ""suck my ...."" was included, not typical TV fare. One love scene with Kirsten Robek showing some skin, but may not be technical nudity

A film I would have been happy to have missed.

7955656,2,B00005UW9K,"I' don't. Low budget, poor story line, bad acting, etc. The movie is more about bad acting with matching egos than avalanches. The best acting in the whole move was done by Robby the rock.",1376092800,,188,4.4
7955657,1,B00005UW9K,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen.  And I like cheesy diaster movies!

I look forward to the Saturday SyFy movies. I enjoy them (yes, I realize there should be a 12-step program for that). But this...horrible. It just stinks.

The acting was stilted, the script was lame.. I could go on and on.  I was really suprised by how bad this really was.  The scene where the Snow Patrol officer warns the snowboarders about the danger - ugh! Cringe worthy. Even Mega-Piranha had better acting than this.

I don't care if this movie is on sale for $1.00 don't blow your money or time on it. It isn't campy, it isn't semi-good, it is just full on crap.",1349740800,,652,4.30327868852459
7955658,2,B00005UW9K,"Strictly speaking, 100% crap.

The only virtue of this movie was

that part of it was shot on Vitosha

mountian just south of Sofia.

Some shots are in front of the

PKSS (Mountain Control and Rescue

Service) headquarters, right behind

Hizha Aleko. You can clearly see

the Bulgarian Red Cross and PKSS logo.",1097884800,,310,4.716981132075472
7955659,3,B00005UW9K,"AVALANCHE ALLEY is one of those movies that you enjoy because of the awesome scenery and the extreme snowboarding.  The plot in this one is fairly simple, if slant:  A ski lodge is undergoing financial difficulties and owner Ed Marinaro decides his wife can turn things around by encouraging snowboarding, the youthful way to re-establish the lodge.  Current manager Nick Mancuso is an alcoholic, jealous of the wife, and so he convinces Marinaro that the wife is having an affair with Ski Patrol Captain Wolf Larson.  Meanwhile a group of teeny boppers decide to go against Larson's advice and snowboard down a slope that is in danger of succumbing to an avalanche.  Sooo..one night the bad boys and girls sneak up the slope, Larson and Marinaro's wife go to plant bombs to cause a controlled avalanche...they spot the snowboarders, try to warn them, etc., etc., avalanche comes and its up to Marinaro and one of the youths (Simon) to save the day.  The movie tends to drag at times, but it does manage to keep you on the edge of your seat.  We feel for Loren as she lies trapped beneath the snow and ice, desperately trying to free herself and the final avalanche is CGI impressive.  Of all the actors, only Tobias Mehler (Wishmaster 3) as Simon is enjoyable to watch and his comic relief and devotion to a cause are well captured.
Not a great movie, but fun to spend a few minutes with.",1088380800,6,1389,4.617886178861789
