Would have preferred more ""G"" & ""PG"" films.

8623302,5,B00GHP8T8W,Great series of movies that adds to one's deeper appreciation of the British cinema's evolution; for the price just buy it,1394755200,2,122,4.857142857142857
8623303,4,B00GHP8T8W,"Items arrived in great condition and super fast! I recommend this seller to anyone. Will order from them again. I do wish the movies will have subtitles bc English is not my first language and I would understand them better, but you are getting 8 movies for almost nothing so is a great deal.",1394064000,,292,4.425925925925926
8623304,3,B00GHP8T8W,"Sometimes even some of our favorite stars make mediocre movies and this latest British Cinema Collection of eight films on two discs is where you can find quite a few of them. For example:  Colin Firth, Emma Thompson,  William Hurt, Anne Hathaway, James McAvoy, Liam Neeson, Patricia Arquette, Ewan McGregor,  Jim Carter, Pete Postelthwaite, Richard E. Grant, Daniel Craig,  Matthew Goode,  Michael Gambon,  Stephen Dillane, Michael Caine, Cheryl Ladd and Gretta Scacchi.

Three films in these two discs are R rated: ""The Serpent's Kiss,"" ""The Advocate"" and ""Love & Rage.""  Four are PG rated, three of them  based on classic novels:  ""Jane Eyre"" (Charlotte Bronte), ""Brideshead Revisited"" (Evelyn Waugh), and ""Ethan Frome"" (Edith Wharton); the fourth, ""Becoming Jane,"" is a soap-operafied take on author Jane Austen's young romance with an Irishman. ""Jekyll & Hyde,"" based on the Robert Lewis Stevenson book, was made for TV and isn't rated.

Worth knowing before you buy:
1. As with other British Cinema Collection 2 disc/8 movie sets, squeezing that many movies onto two discs means there'll be NO subtitles! NO closed-captioning! and NO scene indexes!...
2. Firth fans get some chances to see what their fave looked like in the altogether back in 1993...
3. If you want to read what's on the back of the box, be sure to have a good magnifying glass at hand...

In this reviewer's opinion, this 2-disc, 8-movie set isn't of the caliber of  the two-disc, 8-film British Cinema Collection I bought and reviewed here about a year and a half ago and highly recommend:  http://www.amazon.com/British-Cinema-Collection-Acclaimed-Films/dp/B0080QOL10/ref=cm_cr-mr-title",1393027200,21,1663,5.370656370656371
8623305,4,B00GHP8T8W,"I had seen none of these films before and was very pleased overall. I enjoyed four of the six to varying degrees.  I loved Becoming Jane. I had not seen The Serpent's Kiss (surprisingly good) or this version of Jane Eyre (well done). I also had not seen Brideshead Revisited or Ethan Frome but had heard much of them. Both are excellent. I found The Advocate to be an odd but entertaining film. As is common with collections of this kind, there are two which I will certainly not watch again. Love and Rage is not a bad film. It is an interesting story which I was surprised to find was based on fact. Jekyll and Hyde had little redeeming value other than as an example of what once passed for special effects. I have seen many reviews that complain about collections of this kind. I find that at a cost of about one dollar per movie, this collection was well worth purchasing.",1389312000,20,877,4.380368098159509
