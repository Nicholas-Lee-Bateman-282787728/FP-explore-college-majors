8399113,5,B003KX4Q86,"Wow - I heard about these Marines at Fort Pendleton who were involved with a civilian killing in Iraq, but never heard about it directly from them - till now. This documentary gives a realistic take about what war can do to good men. You know who you want to believe - but you know there's more to the story. If you want to see a ""real"" thriller check this one out. It's a true-life film. Interviews with most of the involved parties.  Make up your own mind.",1295913600,,458,4.204545454545454
8399114,5,B003KX4Q86,Its about time someone blew the lid off of the horrible things our young men and women who serve are asked to do in the name of service to this country. This film takes a hard and unbiased look and 8 young men who were put in an impossible situation. As a former military officer I was both moved and infuriated by this film. Please watch it if you care at all about our military and our country,1295654400,,395,4.076923076923077

8399116,4,B003KX4Q86,"What a compelling story!  Article 32 reflects the inherent contrast and internal conflicts that our soldiers face almost every day in wartime situations, and the choices and actions they take in the name of 'following orders'.  Wow.",1281484800,,232,5.243243243243243
