2889056,3,B000SQFC3G,"Saturday Night Fever was filled with dancing and energy.  It is a video time capsule to the Diaco scene.  Filled with the music of the Bee Gees, this film made you dance and still does.

John Travolta made his starring debut as Tony, far  away from his Barbarino character from Welcome Back Kotter (season one of Kotter is on DVD). Tony lived for his club dancing, until he made a girl and fell in love. In Travolta's first starring vehicle, you can see the star power coming through

In the sequal to Fever, Staying Alive, Tony is now a dancer auditioning like a gypsy for Broadway dancing roles. The film starts with song ""Far from Over"" over the credits, foreshadowing the overlong and overdrawn sequel.

Travolta, whose dance was a marvel in Fever, seem to prance around like a deer lost in the headlights. The script written by Sylvester Stallone (who also directed) tries to do a dancing Rocky, but this vehicle tanks on the ropes. The dancing seem uninspiring and over rehearsed. Tony does take the lead on Broadway, but loses the films audience. We tend not to care in the long run

The highlight of Alive is Steve Inwood, in the role of  Broadway director. He has a flair with his intensive to the play. His role is in a few scenes of the movie, but he steals everything when he is on the film.

I give this double feature three stars for fever and None for Alive

2889084,4,B000SQFC3G,"FIVE STARS:

""Saturday Night Fever"" started out as a low budget film by legendary John Badham and ended up being an unforgettable period piece nominated for Oscars and selling more than 40 million soundtrack albums. A tale of a paint shop guy who blows his money on the weekends to become a local legend on the disco floor, John Travolta nailed the role dead on. Although gritty with language and scenes that some might consider offensive, it is a true life tale of the mid seventies in New York City. Some call it the revival of the movie musical, but it's much more than that. Ultimately a story of one man's growth into adulthood through misled love and the confusion of youth, this freinds and family story rings true to the bone. Fueled with the dance beat of that generation and climaxed with the writing and singing skills of the Bee Gees, this movie is a classic representation of the times.  It is wonderful.

TWO STARS:

Now for the sequel.  Most sequel do not match the original and this is definitely the case here.  However, there is something satisfying in having these bookmarked movies.  Sylvester Stallone pumped up John Travolta and the rest of the World for the sequel to the ground breaking ""Saturday Night Fever"". It deflated faster than needle pricked blow-up Popeye balloon. It may be worth renting and watching stoned just to see what bad actors do with nasty characters. The ending is a ""Broadway"" production that seems like a badly concocted rock concert with lasers and props that just don't make sense - ""Dante's Inferno""? Terribly cliche.

The dancing is mechanical and uninspired using brother Frank Stallon's hit song, ""Far From Over"" in so many different outtakes, I thought I had been in rehearsal too long. Nepotism reached new lows.

The true unforgivable error Stallone made was the abuse and horrible editing he gave to the Bee Gees truly inspired music. Virtually none of the upbeat songs were used, except as momentary filler and the full versions of the rest were all non-Bee Gees songs. It was reported that the Bee Gees stayed away from commenting, other than to say, ""Let the public decide"". The public did and this turkey is overcooked.

The best feeling one gets from this film is at the finale when Travolta walks ""away from it all"", strutting to ""Stayin' Alive"" (or was it because it was the end of the movie?). Nope - no extras on this DVD either.",1481587200,,2395,4.708133971291866

Themes here include being a young person uncertain of the next step and the vagaries of relationships. Pay no attention to these themes and watch for the dancing. Popcorn required

2889148,4,B000SQFC3G,"I finally have gotten around, now in late 2014 at 71 years of age, to watching these two motion pictures! I should not have taken so seriously the miles-laid-thick snobbery about these two films, especially regarding ""Saturday Night Fever"" (S.N.F.), and all the additional snubbing of disco music and of disco dancing. On their own terms, these two films are terrifically entertaining. The dancing remains wonderful; seen now, the disco dancing in S.N.F. often looks remarkably elegant, even (oddly enough) rather genteel, and certainly necessitates much Terpsichorean ballroom-like skill. Atop that, ""Saturday Night Fever"" has a storyline full of grit and of warm human interest, quite apart from the superb scenes on the dance-floor. Of course, most Amazon users will know already that ""Staying Alive"" is the sequel to S.N.F.

In the earlier film, Tony Manero, John Travolta's character, is 19 years old, the teen disco king of his neighbourhood in Brooklyn, N.Y. Travolta, already a star on T.V., especially, for the youth market, does S.N.F.'s disco-style dancing exceedingly well and is quite accomplished as an actor. He interacts with Tony Manero's male pals and with the women in S.N.F. like a truly seasoned actor.

In ""Staying Alive"", Tony Manero has become an aspiring professional dancer, now aged 25, for Broadway and modern dance. The storyline for ""Staying Alive"" does not have the convincing plot and characterisation that capture the viewer's heart to anywhere near the extent that S.N.F. did so, and, in fact, ""Staying Alive"" is rather stiff and lacking in credibility in many ways, but the dancing in Broadway and modern dance idioms in that film is exceptionally good.

Best of all in ""Staying Alive"" is the modern dance ballet sequence, ""Satan's Alley"". It is a quite vivid, an utterly decadent, and a S&M-infused bit of deviltry, sulfurously erotic. Some have written that ""Satan's Alley"" is ""way over the top"", but, actually, it is brilliantly choreographed and shows Travolta's brilliant dancing skills for all that they are worth (which is to say, a lot!); the only (relatively slight) flaw is the resort excessively often to too much slow-motion camera work. ""Satan's Alley"", in fact, is what makes ""Staying Alive"" really worth continued viewing. Of course, John Travolta is, if anything, even more achingly vivid, physically, his bare flesh (getting down to loincloth-only as his costume sheds) which is on close-to-complete display of his superlative body in much of ""Satan's Alley"". At this point in his life and movie career, Travolta was alike ""studly"" of body and even more incineratingly macho of good looks (including his fine face's still youthful beauty) than he had been so already in S.N.F.

Don't wait so long, folks, as I did to view these two movies, so conveniently coupled on this double-DVD product, the two films within a single container (Paramount Home Entertainment 13096 being the North American edition viewed, in widescreen display). The bonus features, of a strongly retrospective nature, on the disc for S.N.F. are excellent and varied; as for ""Staying Alive"", the disc devoted to that move has no such extra features.",1418083200,6,3171,5.1875

2889154,1,B000SQFC3G,"just about every movie buff will tell you of at least one film they enjoyed, even loved, which went down in history as crap because the critics stated a rumor that it sucked. as if that weren't bad enough, such juggernauts are just as capable of getting a terrible film misclassified as a masterpiece. and frankly, i'm not sure which turn of events i find more irksome. this is Exhibit A.
this is a film fit to be screened only in federal prisons, and even there only as a last resort. this, gang, is IT: the lowest of the low, the bottom of the barrel, the great slap in the face of artistic integrity, the one every lover of true movie magic most fervently wishes would just go away. Saturday Night Fever is quite literally the WORST!! FILM!! EVER!! MADE!!!!!!!
or every LIKELY to be made! ""John Badham,"" the name credited (or blamed) as director, is either a Director's Guild smokescreen a' la ""Alan Smithee"" or a pseudonym for Ed Wood. (as Sherlock says, eliminate the impossible and whatever remains, however improbable...)
strong words, i grant you. so why are they so warranted? the film's unpardonable sin is twofold.
for starters, there's the fact that it is a textbook example of the trend exploitation film, the sort where the script is completed within two hours of some industry muckety-muck learning of the existence of a trend to be exploited. that's fairly benign as sins go, but of the hundreds of such films, Fever is hands-down the most shameless. usually they try to dress it up with some vestige of a plot, some passing suggestion of something in our hero's life other than whatever fad is being capitalized upon, but whoever was in charge here couldn't be bothered. he clearly figured, ""those disco geeks will come regardless, so why exhaust studio resources, not to mention wear ourselves out, with work we don't really need to do?"" consequently, the film comes off as almost proud to be a one-dimension fluff-piece which wouldn't even exist if not for what was ""hip"" at that particular moment.
even so, it could've been only marginally offensive, just another cold-blooded fast buck gambit, if only it hadn't, in the process, created the ""innovation"" which has since been most detrimental to the art of filmmaking, namely: bludgeoning the audience with a certain ""F""-word. the word in question had made a few Silver Screen inroads in recent years, but it wasn't until Fever that someone worked up the nerve to have every single character drop at least one F-bomb in EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE!! and it's pathetically transparent that this was done chiefly (if not solely) as an attempted distraction from the film's otherwise complete lack of inspiration.
the havoc so wreaked continues to this day. nothing, and i do mean NOTHING, gets old or irksome in a movie faster than too much swearing. some would suggest that you ""put in the context of the times,"" and indeed, it was a pretty ballsy move at time to devote roughly 8/10th of a given movie's dialogue to language your mother wouldn't let you use. but most such language, thanks largely to the kazillion movies which would follow suit, doesn't have the same shock value anymore. today that big ""F"" not so much offensive as something far, far worse: tedious and tiresome. and we have Fever to thank for this appalling turn of events.
and DON'T even get me started on that hideous final moment where Travolta relinquishes his dancing contest prize to another couple who were ostensibly better but snubbed for being Latino. in a film with some substance, some HEART to it, this could've been quite moving. from this mercenary fiasco it just feels maudlin and smarmy (not to mention FORCED).
the moral of the story is, be afraid, be VERY afraid, of any film about disco of which the best part is the music.
as for Staying Alive, talk about your paradoxes. despite a reputation as one of the all-time sequel letdowns, it is in fact the better of the two movies. but of course it would be no challenge to make a better film than Fever, so that's not really saying much. Staying Alive is better than Saturday Night Fever, but only in the sense that stubbing your toe hurts less than a toothache.
this time around we find Travolta pursuing a career dancing on Broadway. under the direction of Sylvester Stallone, the result is basically a little-man-takes-his-shot opus of the sort he'd already done with three Rocky films. but even the weakest of Rocky Balboa's endeavors had a heart and soul which is sorely missing here. in fact, if Stallone hadn't made a walk-on appearance in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, this film could easily be taken for some imitator's attempted forgery of Rocky.
so what makes it so much better than Fever? chiefly the fact that it doesn't engage in the same blitzkrieg of profanity. that's certainly a noble gesture, but the lesson was learned to late. Staying Alive is therefore less irritating than it's ancestor, but ultimately just as farcical a waste of your time and just as shameless an insult to your intelligence.",1410134400,2,5023,4.7813578826237055
