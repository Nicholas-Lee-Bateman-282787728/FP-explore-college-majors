7816946,5,6301920880,I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't want to see it. A nostalgic fave as there is nothing else worth watching nowadays on tv.,1356307200,,127,4.12
7816947,3,6301920880,"This tape is all animation of the DC Superheroes Captain Marvel, Cap. Marvel Jr. and Mary Marvel and has absolutely NO footage of the old ""Super Hero High"" live-action series from the 70's.  Amazon's review of this item is wrong; NONE of the actors mentioned appear on this short (25 minutes) tape.  The animation is great and the plot is actually good (rare for Filmation's attempts with DC heroes), so if you are a fan of Shazam (Captain Marvel) then buy a copy.  However, please notice that this tape is recorded in SLP mode and the playback may not be very good on your VCR.  If you are not a fan of the Big Red Cheese, save your money.",1156118400,,640,4.352941176470588
7816948,5,6301920880,"I saw this episode before and I thought it was great!  Billy Batson, Mary Batson and Freedy Freeman are kidnapped by the evil Ibac's evil Hismen taken back many years in the past.  Great story!  I don't want to spoil any more of the plot!  Get your copy as soon as you can!",1020556800,2,273,4.09433962264151
