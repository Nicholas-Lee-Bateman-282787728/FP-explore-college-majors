690434,4,6303592554,"I bought this DVD because one of the actors in it I knew from Chicago was deceased and I wanted to see his movie role. I was pleasently surprised and entertained by the ""tongue in cheek"" approach of this movie. It is very funny, poking fun at all the 'B' horror movies I saw as a kid in the fifties. It has a great supporting cast of known actors who I think had a lot fun doing this flick. The dialogue just streams with cliches and the scenes are right out of just about every atomic mutant movie ever made. For pure non-frightening entertainment this is a great movie.",1054598400,9,571,4.247706422018348
690435,2,6303592554,"Yet another homage to 50s sf/horror flicks. The movie predictably opens with a woman being eaten by the monster of the title (Kevin Peter Hall). No prizes for guessing where it's hiding. Being a PG movie there is no blood, just clothes being thrown out of the door. Strange considering this is a Troma production. But soon the monster, which resembles a man-sized chicken wing breaks out of the closet and as in all B movies wrecks havoc on the townspeople. Soon a biological technician and a small town obituary columnist(?!) are assigned to investigate the strange diappearance while the police, army and every man and his dog are called in to eradicate the chicken. This isn't one of Troma's best, or one of their ""Best Worst"" but you get to see Stella Stevens in the shower, so that's god enough for me to rate this 2 stars.",1035676800,2,828,4.601351351351352
690436,5,6303592554,"This movie is often in the horror section in the video stores. Therefore, some people who expect a horror movie might get disappointed. I would call this a comedy and it is a really funny comedy that spoofs a number of horror movies, for instance, the shower scene in Psycho (1960). The actors are actually quite good and the characters are funny, like Diane, who always lists her arguments ""A...B...C..."" and Dr. Pennyworth who starts to talk about the frog he found when he was young all the time. And the angry General Turnbull. And some other stupid funny things like that everybody gets almost hypnotized every time Richard Clark takes off his glasses. Well, it's to funny to tell you have to see it yourself! I very much recommend this movie to everybody who likes funny comedies and especially to you who likes horror movies and comedies!

690437,5,6303592554,"This film is a classic. Spoofing monster films of the 50's, including ""The Thing"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Them"", as well as the more recent ""Psycho"" and ""Close Encounters"", this is a film buff's delight from start to finish.

690538,4,6303592554,Very cool satire. A pretty early commentary on homosexuality. Who knew there were some fairly progressive thinkers back in the early eighties? Couldn't believe that little kid was Paul Walker. What a trip! The list of people that helped to get this little independent film made is pretty impressive too. Harry Nilsson. Ringo Starr. Wow.

690684,2,6303592554,"This movie is the parallel of what it would be like if a gay person would become if kept in the closet all his life, to become a monster. During the movie, there is a Clark Kent/Superman type of thing going between the main leads, cause whenever the macho lead has his glasses taken off, the woman falls hopelessly in a love like trance, until he immediately puts them back on to his former Clark Kent state, and she is again, normal. The monster rampages throughout the movie with no hope in sight of destroying in my any scientific means or army approach, but it takes the lovelorn look of the monster to view the leading man by accident without his specs to fall head over heels. This makes the monster travel on a doomed trek to the capital of homosexuality, San Francisco, where he finally runs out of steam, and collapses with the continuing seductive eyes of a very unafraid male captive who suddenly becomes released back to heterosexual freedom.
Apart from the gay innuendo of a tortured monster not being able to find true love until the end, this movie ranks as your local station channel fodder.",1318291200,,1107,4.567839195979899
690685,5,6303592554,"I grew up watching all those fifties SCI-FI flicks that this movie handily lampooned.  (THEM! is one of my all time favorite monster movies.)
Every aspect of those cheesy movies was faithfully rendered in this low budget homage.  They had me roped and tied from the start with a blind John Carradine trying to get his Seeing Eye dog to respond.  The cast in general was great: Claude Akins spitting everywhere, Howard Duff with a really big cross and a very strange eulogy, Henry Gibson and his weird fascination with frogs, but especially Donald Moffat as the obligatory commander of the army (his best line, ""I don't give a monkey's fart!"").
I loved this movie.  There wasn't a false note, start to finish.  I couldn't stop smiling.  It reinforced all the reasons I loved (and still love) those crazy monster movies from the fifties.
As for someone not familar with movies like Tarantula, The Deadly Mantis, or Monster on the Campus, I don't know how you'd respond to a movie like this.
Love them or hate them, they are what they are and if you ""get"" them, you'll get this.
Oh come on, IT WAS FUNNY!",1297987200,5,1101,4.591836734693878
690759,1,6303592554,"I enjoyed the movie, though it is cheesy. (You can read the other reviews for the movie plot details.)  But I gave this a 1 star because the DVD is a copy of the VHS Tape.  Even the FBI warning at the start says illegal to copy this ""TAPE"".  The quality is not good, but still watchable.  In addition, they put R rated material on a PG rated movie.  And that material starts before you even get to the disc menu, plus the bonus material also has R rated material.  More of an FYI if you plan on showing this movie to your family.",1291507200,2,529,4.038461538461538

690761,4,6303592554,"MONSTER IN THE CLOSET, as everyone has said, is a wonderful monster / sci-fi movie parody. The humor is well-placed, the creature is decently realized, and the characters are just nutty enough to not be stupid. As a 1950s-80s sci-fi maniac, I love all of the references and satire, especially the CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and THING elements! My favorite parts in the movie are John Carradine as the blind old guy, and Stella Stevens (whom I've loved ever since the original Nutty Professor) in the shower scene! Oh my! I watched that sequence several times in order to observe her tremendous acting technique. Whew! Anyway, I recommend MITC to any / all horror spoof addicts...",1197504000,3,669,4.87719298245614
690762,5,6303592554,"If you enjoy b movies and monsters that look like poop, this one's for you.  It has a solid cast, and a comedic subtlety that you just don't find in other movies. The monster is one of the slowest moving monsters in cinema history, but everyone insists that it's going to kill all of mankind. There are many scenes that will leave you with a smile and a deep appreciation for the effort it took to create this piece of crap. The xylophone scene is classic! If you're looking for gore look elsewhere, but if you like cheesy 80's monster movies, you won't be disappointed. If you mix a case of beer, a few friends, and Hard Rock Zombies, you have the recipe for one mighty glorious evening. 4.5 stars",1188345600,3,698,4.369230769230769
690763,4,6303592554,"as far as b-movies go, this one is an instant classic. The monster alone is too funny. If you are a collector or enjoy cheesy horror/sci fi nonsense you should pick this one up. Not incredibly violent, but very ridiculous.",1173571200,,222,4.575
690764,5,6303592554,"This is a hilarious low-tech movie that most people can enjoy. It is not overdone with loud unrealistic Special Effects that destroy the pleasure of current horror flicks. The movie is done in a straight-up CAMPY style, even the faint of heart will be won over. When I reflect on some of the scenes I still burst out with laughter!",1140825600,5,331,4.533333333333333
690765,4,6303592554,"Let me first start off by saying this...do not see this movie if you are expecting a serious, epic horror film.  It's not that at all.  But for fans of campy movies such as those old monster movies, then you will love this!  Also, Stacy Ferguson (Fergie, from Black Eyed Peas) has a short little part in the movie, she's in like the first scene.  It's kind of weird seeing her so young, since I never watched Kids Incorporated.  But, all in all, a good movie for campy horror film fans!",1097971200,4,486,4.2967032967032965
690766,5,6303592554,"This rare film, made with lots of personal sacrifice from the cast and crew, is well worth the effort to seek out. ""Monster In The Closet"" is a satire of formulaic monster movies, and is done with great wit and charm on a low budget. The story concerns a mysterious set of serial murders in which all victims are killed in their closets. Early victims include the horror movie institution, John Carradine, this time as a cranky blind man who gets eaten.
A spittoon-toting Sheriff (Claude Akins) tries to defeat the monster while ignoring scientific counsel from scientists Denise Dubarry and Henry Gibson. Gibson is particularly entertaining as a half-baked forgetful professor who thinks he can communicate with the creature via a xylophone (he can, as it turns out, not that it does him any good), and is forever prattling on about a frog he once found. The male lead is Donald Grant, who does a great job as the naive 'Pretty Boy' reporter sent to cover the story as harassment by veteran reporter ""Scoop"" played by Frank Ashmore. I have never been as pleased in a movie as when Grant stands up to Ashmore.
When the creature finally does show up it is a gross looking kind of excrement monster with a second sub-head in a spoof of ""Alien"", which actually can be communicated with. In the end not only does Gibson get to chat with the creature via the xylophone, but Grant gets to chat via kazoo, as well. The Army seems powerless to do anything, a romance subplot flourishes, and we get to what would seem to be the climactic scene of the film. There is a great twist in the last 15 minutes, which I did not see coming, and probably most other people won't either. Suffice it to say, it is silly, involves a lot of property mutilation that I would not want to explain to my Homeowner's policy issuer, love, self-sacrifice (sort of), and hope springing eternal. (And ultimately a lot of expensive remodeling.)
The film is a great, cheesy, fun movie to watch (best with friends) and I highly recommend it. Troma distributes it, but did not produce it, so it is not typical Troma fare. It is not particularly violent (except the scenes of violent closet disruption and some Army efforts at the grade school) or gory (well, OK, the monster mouth is pretty nasty), has little objectionable except one fairly gratuitous scene of Stella Stevens in an excellent ""Psycho"" parody, and is just plain fun.
Watch a great low budget movie and see why B Movies can be so much fun. Grab ""Monster In The Closet"" today!",1089504000,9,2504,4.616591928251121

690768,4,6303592554,"The Monster in the Closet is a wonderful send up of classic man-in-a-rubber-suit b-movies of the 50's.  In this one, a mysterious monster suddenly appears in a closet in a small town North of San Francisco and proceeds to start killing people.  It is able to move from closet to closet unseen.
Richard Clark is a hopeless reporter who is sent out to cover the nutty story. What he finds is a true story of horror and terror that can shock the world.  He is suddenly in the middle of the biggest story ever.
A wonderful cast helps keep the movie right on track.  Claude Akins is the tobacco-spitting Sherif and Henry Gibson is an Einstein-like scientist plus many others.
