7914526,1,B00001ODH7,"Real quick...I knew this was going to be bad but I was hoping for a good kind of bad, you know? This was just appallingly bad. I want to like Daniel Bernhardt and I'm sure he is a really nice guy in real life. But an actor...no. He is better than the female blonde lead she stinks so bad that I smell it through the TV screen. As the villain James Hong, who has been around a long time and is so good, all he does is laugh in a sinister way and badly. RUN AWAY from this nightmare.",1417219200,,481,3.8686868686868685
7914527,4,B00001ODH7,"This one is a movie about a supernatural sword, there is quite a bit in the way of sword fighting. The sword belonged to Alexander the Great. It has special powers, a fun movie.",1356220800,,177,4.235294117647059
7914528,2,B00001ODH7,"Of the nine or so films I've seen of Daniel Bernhardt, this is the worst. Coming near the end of his tenure as a leading man, ""G2"" desperately tries to remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B001JFZ118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>&nbsp;for the martial arts B-movie crowd but fails thanks to its incomprehensible story. Not even the novelty of seeing the Swiss Van Damme handling swords can make up for this miniature debacle.

The story: Acting out an age-old battle, a reborn Macedonian warrior (Bernhardt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-2/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 2</a>) does battle with a Mongolian warlord (James Hong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Trouble-in-Little-China/dp/B000QUCQX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Trouble in Little China</a>) for ownership of the sword of Alexander the Great.

The plot sounds pretty simple, but somehow, it grows to include underground fighting and talking statues. The story's not so complicated that it's impossible to figure out, but plot points are presented in such awkward and convoluted ways that you have to pay more attention than you should have to for a trashy fight flick. Fifteen minutes into the movie, I still had no idea who anybody was, thanks to the poor definition of the performers' roles and the overuse of flashbacks to a medieval battle (seriously, we probably see that fight a half-dozen times). The movie frequently tries to fool you into thinking you're watching something epic via digital inserts, 3D animation, and plenty of voice-overs, but it's easy to realize there's nothing really to see here.

This extends to the fight content, which I had been counting on to save the film. Even though this is a B-movie with the right to indulge in fisticuffs, the film constantly interrupts its fights by cutting away to adjoining scenes. Though the 12 fights feature a variety of combatants and weapons - not unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shootfighter/dp/B00005UWOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shootfighter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Samurai/dp/B000AYEL3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Samurai</a>&nbsp;- they're almost all ruined by other events taking precedence over the fighting. Only the duel between Bernhardt and Simon Kim (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xtreme-Fighter/dp/B0007Z0OOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xtreme Fighter</a>) is largely untouched by this, but even though a couple cool moves are displayed, the result is a merely average exchange. Nevertheless, it should be noted that ""G2"" is a surprisingly violent movie, featuring no less than three decapitations and a silly/gruesome scene wherein a fire eater is shot in the stomach and flames shoot out of his belly.

James Hong is one of my favorite actors, but the film actually makes me sick of him thanks to all his nonsensical screaming and giggling. Daniel Bernhardt isn't much better, and bland cop Meera Schiro (""Love Letters: A Romantic Trilogy"") is forgettable. In conclusion, the movie is pretty boring and not worth buying. I don't even know who to recommend it to, so know yourself before you purchase.",1332028800,,3415,6.633109619686801
7914529,3,B00001ODH7,I bought this DVD at a local store expecting low level acting & decent fight scenes.  Didn't expect the great acting & really good fight scenes.  I was most impressed by some of the special effects especially fire shooting out of one of the fighters stomach.,1008892800,3,258,4.586956521739131
