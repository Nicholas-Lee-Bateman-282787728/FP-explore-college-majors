8314035,4,B000B8I9XG,"This picks up where the first volume left off.  There are four episodes on this DVD.  They continue with the same light-hearted attitude of the first disk, but seems to throw in about double the fan service.  Some of the characters are given a little more depth (but not a lot).  Also, you start getting some explaination of who the Faydoon are, how Tomo fits into the whole Earth/Dreamworld story.  If you enjoyed the first disk then you will certainly enjoy this one.",1136505600,,469,4.602409638554217
