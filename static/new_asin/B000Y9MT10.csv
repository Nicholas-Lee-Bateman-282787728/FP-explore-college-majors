These guys are amazing and if you really like DMB you will find this DVD really interesting. Of course, no matter how many times you have listened to all DMB's Classics you want to listen to them again and again since they always have new ways to play each song.",1203206400,,536,4.414141414141414
3017705,4,B000Y9MT10,"I got this DVD for my boyfriend for a Christmas present. He absolutely loves it! He watches it all the time, still. I would reccomend this product for anyone who enjoys Dave.",1202428800,2,174,4.46875
3017706,5,B000Y9MT10,"As soon as Dave appears you're glued to the tv.  He and his band are so in tune with each other, it's amazing to watch and hear.  Dave is mesmerizing on this DVD, so much so that anyone who's lived under a rock and never seen him perform will be hooked for life.  Particularly after his chilling performance of ""Don't Drink the Water"" where he is so into the song that one may be able to count how many cavaties he had as a kid.

Dave talks between songs, but not too much - and hey, we must all admit that his sometimes incoherent ramblings are interesting and kinda amusing.  He's happy during this concert, and you can tell!  Another song to note is the newer ""Cornbread"" which I constantly replay; and ""Two Step"" is always a great - his *prologue* to this one on the DVD is particularly moving, singing about his love & emptiness.  I could go on, but I won't because you need to stop reading and order this.",1201910400,2,911,4.261627906976744

3017709,3,B000Y9MT10,"First I want to say that seeing this show in person was a great experience and I loved every minute of it.  However, with that said, this dvd does not do it justice.  I've given it three stars because of the quality of the songs and because there are many great moments.  I'm very disappointed in the picture quality and sound.  The video is not nearly as sharp as some of the band's past releases.  Also the sax and trumpet can barely be heard in the mix.  I don't know if it was my system I was using, but I had to turn the center speaker way down because Dave's vocals were overpowering most of the music.  With all of that being said I still recommend this release if you are a fan simply because it was a great concert that deserves to be viewed.  If you are a casual fan or this is your first time watching them in concert, I'd recommend ""Listener Supported"" or the ""Central Park Concert"".",1199491200,8,895,4.223529411764706

3017752,5,B000Y9MT10,"VERY, SUPER, OUTSTANDING!!! You get the Dave Matthews Band along with some guest musicians, which include: Rashawn Ross playing Trumpet (and he is great!), also, you get guest musicians of Warren Haynes (of Government Mule and the Allman Brothers Band, and GREG ALLMAN (OF THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND). Greg co-performs the classic ""Melissa"" along with Dave Matthews and his band.

I was lucky enough to get to see the Dave Matthews Band perform at the New Orleans Jazz Fesival in the Spring of 2005, this was before Hurricane Katrina. They are an excellent live band, and this 2 disc concert dvd prooves it!!!

You get 12 songs on disc one, and 8 songs on disc two.

This was filmed at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia sometime around 2006 or 2007.

This one is very special because, founding member and Saxaphone player LeRoi Moore is in this dvd, and he died during 2008 from injuryies obtained through an All Terrain Vechicle accident. He will be GREATLY missed.

This dvd concert contains some songs from the ""Stand - Up"" cd, such as ""Louisiana Bayou"", plus all their clasics.

This in an outstanding 2 disc concert dvd, I do believe it may very well be the best concert dvd of the Dave Matthews Band. It is simply awesome!!! IF YOU'RE A DAVEHEAD - THIS IS A ""MUST HAVE"" 2 DISC CONCERT DVD!!! I REALLY ENJOY MINE, IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES, ESPECIALLY WITH THE GUEST MUSICIANS OF WARREN HAYNES AND GREG ALLMAN!!! I highly, gladly, and encouragingly, recommend this one. If you're not a Dave Matthews Band fan, you will be after watching this 2 disc concert dvd.

3017753,4,B000Y9MT10,The playlist and the audio track on this DVD are amazing.  It's a great mix of new songs with the old.  The only real problem with this DVD is the video quality.  There is a lot of digital errors in the video but it is watchable.  I have seen the same concert on HD Net and the master is not the problem.  My theory is that they spent so much attention on the audio quality that they sacrificed video to get it.  There is only so much room on a DVD.,1228089600,,449,3.879120879120879

The set list doesn't matter because the live band makes them all sound the same after one or two minutes. The sound quality in stereo 2.0 is good.

Would have been better if they had made Live Trax 10 from Portugal a DVD instead of this show. Nonetheless, if you're a DMB fan, you'll love this dvd!",1218499200,,430,4.455696202531645
3017757,5,B000Y9MT10,"Absolutely fabulous concert by DMB. Along with the Central park concert, this is the second DVD you must have if you love Dave Matthews band, and not only if you are a hardcore fan. Any musician or music lover should watch this. Great sound and video quality, solid and vibey performance of Dave and the band.
This also exists as an mp3 download at 256 kbs from DMB website. Together with the Lisbon concert (""live trax 10) is one of the best live recordings from Dave Matthews Band.",1211846400,,483,4.5
3017758,3,B000Y9MT10,"Let me say I love the Dave Matthews Band and own many of their DVD's, most are awesome!  The key word is ""Band"".  Whoever mixed the sound on this DVD obviously knows nothing about them.  Sound on jams is UN hearable on that member, and video of them jamming is literally non existent, and focuses on other band members not doing the jam.  The DVD pretty much focuses on Dave, unlike other past DVD's, that show the other band members musical talent.  Ex: Boyd and or others will be doing a killer jam and the camera will be focused on Carter or Dave.  If you like the ""Band"" this isn't a good DVD.",1211414400,2,597,4.238938053097345
3017759,4,B000Y9MT10,"After the thrill of watching the Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds Blu-ray Disc release, it was very exciting to hear of the Piedmont Park release being announced as shot in high definition. Unfortunately it didn't come out on Blu-ray, only on DVD and CD, but after watching the DVD it's easy to see why! I don't know what cameras were used for this recording, but they were certainly not of the same calibre as the ones used for the Central Park release.

The highlight of this release is the LPCM 2.0 stereo track, which blows the Dolby Digital 5.1 track clean out of the water. In addition the LPCM stereo track is 24-bit, so it is of higher fidelity than the CD, which is not often the case with DVD releases.

Most DVD releases still include a Dolby stereo track, which is lossy compression just like .mp3 - fortunately under the SonyBMG umbrella we're lucky enough to see an uncompressed 24-bit track. To put this in perspective:

Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD) = 448 Kbps
CD 2.0 stereo (CD) = 1,411 Kbps
24/48 2.0 PCM (DVD) = 2,304 Kbps

That's right, the 2.0 PCM track on the DVD is almost twice the fidelity of the CD release.

If you have a nice home theatre system you might wonder why the 5.1 track might not be the better choice, but do yourself a favour and set your system to either DIRECT, STEREO or 5/6/7 CHANNEL STEREO and experience the difference in quality of the PCM track over the Dolby track. You will no doubt appreciate it and never select the Dolby 5.1 track again!

The only other DMB release to feature a PCM track, also 24-bit, is the Central Park Concert, which should hopefully see a Blu-ray release sometime in the future complete with a 5.1 PCM 24-bit track. The 2.0 tracks on Listener Supported and the Gorge releases are both Dolby stereo, so you're better off with the 5.1 tracks on those releases.

The performance itself is well worth owning, marking the first time some of the new songs like Cornbread have been performed full band, but it's also the first time we've seen tracks like One Sweet World and Dreaming Tree on DVD and this performance of Dreaming Tree alone makes this DVD a must in any DMB fan's collection.

Hopefully with Tim Reynolds joining the band this Summer we can look forward to another DMB release sometime in the near future and hopefully this time they'll get it right and release it on Blu-ray. The format was made for music!

I can't give this release 5 stars because of the picture quality, but it is an easy 4-star release with this excellent PCM 2.0 audio track.",1210809600,19,2523,4.50328227571116

Hopefully with Tim Reynolds joining the band this Summer we can look forward to another DMB release sometime in the near future and hopefully this time they'll get it right and release it on Blu-ray. The format was made for music!

I can't give this release 5 stars because of the picture quality, but it is an easy 4-star release with this excellent PCM 2.0 audio track.",1210809600,19,2523,4.50328227571116
