8409621,2,B003YL4NL4,"My goal was to order some decent quality trailers to include with an outdoor ""drive-in"" movie night.  Although there are many trailers available on Youtube, the quality (resolution) is generally pretty low.  While I have no complaint about the resolution of the trailers included in this compilation, the trailers themselves are pretty worthless.  Just a bunch of B movie (if that) sci-fi and kung fu trailers.  That wasn't what I was after so this this purchase was a waste of money.  If the manufacturer or Amazon had included a list of the trailers in its description of this collection, I would have looked elsewhere.",1419033600,,621,4.9326923076923075
