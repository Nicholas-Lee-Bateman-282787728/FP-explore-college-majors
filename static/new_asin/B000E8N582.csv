5510627,4,B000E8N582,"This is an interesting apologetics lesson -- that takes place mostly in a series of cab rides!  It's set up in five sessions that are 20 to 30 minutes long.  There's a study guide available that summarizes the Q&A (and could be useful in a Bible study).  You can access the study guide here:
[...]
While I'd term this lesson not terribly deep in general, Joe Boot comes across very 'real' & well spoken.  I particularly liked the session on ""What about other faiths?""  I thought that Joe gently, but truthfully, covered this topic very well.",1212451200,3,541,4.59375
8558128,4,B000E8N582,"Well presented interview explaining how some people maintain their Christian faith in the face of modernity. Articulate and intelligent. Not entirely balanced in the sense of the statements and statistics quoted about current scientific controversy are from the presenter. Foot noted through out, which was nice.",1447200000,,312,5.804347826086956
8558129,1,B000E8N582,"I just finished watching this and wow was it painful.  I am absolutely fascinated by religion especially Christianity since I live in America.  If Christians want to get their message to the masses they need to find a way to encourage idiots like this from speaking and especially making movies.  The explanations and arguments are watered down simplified versions of arguments that much brighter apologists have attempted to defend.  Most of them don't hold up to the slightest scrutiny from anyone who decides to question the ideas in a honest and logical manner.  This guy has an answer for everything and speaks quick and confident as if everything he says is simply a fact. I would only recommend this if you are someone who chooses not to think for yourself and is willing to accept things people tell you, despite the lack of evidence.  At the beginning of part one the movie explains what presupposition is and warns the viewer that that line of thinking is wrong. The rest of the movie is just a series of presuppositions one after the other.  The only people who would get value from this movie are teachers and students who study logic and reason as a great source to pick apart all the bad examples of the subject they are learning.",1446163200,,1244,4.678899082568807
8558130,2,B000E8N582,"A conversation with scarcely unchallenged facts, is not informative.",1444176000,,68,6.666666666666667
8558131,1,B000E8N582,"The description of this film is very misleading. The first sentence asks the question ""Does Christianity add up?"", and in the first 10 minutes we can clearly see that this is not an honest attempt to answer that question but merely an effort to confirm that it does in some obscure fashion. If the man asking the question desired a legitimate answer, there would be scientific rebuttals to the feeble arguments of the believers. The first man claims we all have faith in something and then proceeds to tell us that ""we"" have the wrong definition of faith. Well, here you go buddy: straight from Merriam-Webster  ""firm belief in something for which there is no proof"". The film is full of instances that leave the logical person scratching their head in disbelief. Don't waste your time on this if you're looking for something intellectually stimulating...",1430870400,4,855,4.896551724137931
8558132,2,B000E8N582,"I realized within 20 minutes as Mr. Boot got into the notions of ""worldviews"",  reality-marking ""buoys"" and ""authorities"" that he didn't have a clue about what science-disciplined reason is. His arguments are a very slick example of sleight of mouth ornamented by intentionally intimidating language. Pure sophistry. I'd love to go head-to-head with him. I'm confident that any skeptic & scholar of ancient history would have him in knots. His simplistic refutation of science as a way of knowing is typically devoid of real understanding. Filled with many straw man constructions that many reiligious apologists use, this 2 hour taxi ride is waste of meter time.",1430524800,4,663,5.254716981132075
8558133,4,B000E8N582,"Well, the music is terrible.  lol  I also find the British accents to be strangely upsetting (even I cannot explain that).  The questions asked are the same ones I hear quite often.  The answers are insightful, though here & there there might have been a little dodging, but even the dodge was not far away.  There are sooo many other Q&A out there and I AM listening.  It's well worth a listen.",1425859200,,395,4.416666666666667
8558134,5,B000E8N582,The difference and ramifications of objective vs subjective religion clearly explained.  Nothing matters so much.,1425081600,,113,6.533333333333333
8558135,5,B000E8N582,Great video!  Very clearly stated for Christian Apologetics.,1424390400,,60,6.5
8558136,1,B000E8N582,"One of the most laughable and shallow set of Christian apologetics I have run across in my 25+ years of listening to discussions such as this. It is blatantly clear that the person doing the ""questioning"" (I use that term very loosely) has no real interest in scrutinizing the apologists claims. This is just an exercise in stroking of the ego and ones beliefs all you see is one soft ball question after another with every assertion made by the apologist accepted as fact & without any further investigation. Who do I contact to get the last 2 hours of my life ""refunded""?",1414540800,9,573,4.572815533980583
8558137,5,B000E8N582,A nice introduction to the key questions and answers of the Christian faith. J. John and Joe Boot have a conversation around London about the truthfulness and Christianity in comparison to other beliefs. It's not stuffy or overly intellectual! Well done!,1408752000,,254,5.219512195121951
