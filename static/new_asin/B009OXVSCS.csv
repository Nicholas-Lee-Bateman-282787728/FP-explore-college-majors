8543451,4,B009OXVSCS,"Just to  be understood: I am hearing and I have an interest in sign language. So my review might be a tad biased since I wasn't raised in Deaf culture. With that in mind, I found this film enjoyable.
The jokes are often of a classic body swap film but I found them to be so much more funny. I was laughing though the whole film during the body swap section of the film. The film itself revovles around two teachers in a school for the Deaf. The two do not like each other. On their birthday, they swap bodies and chaos ensues. It felt like it had the same type of comedy as a stage farce which I can enjoy.

(SPOILERS!)
One part that I didn't seem to like was the main villain, the woman with the PhD. Who the hell would send threats to a high school coach to get some jock to play, as if the doctor was a mob boss. That seems too outlandish for me.

The other part was some of the reactions from the two main characters. It almost sounds like they don't realize that they have swapped bodies and the two main characters haven't thought about how their words feel weird to others coming from these different bodies. Still I can overlook that and enjoy it for a good comedy.",1388620800,4,1173,4.158590308370044
