5340443,5,B009INAH58,"I must admit the Tea Party is one of my favorite band .Still cannot figure out how come these Guys are not Super Star .On this dvd they are better than ever,Come on come share a little Tea our way.",1371772800,,197,3.95
5340444,5,B009INAH58,Burrows and Chatwood are great musicians and composers but Martin just kills it here. Just a tremendous talent. His vox are pretty much dead on for the entire show and he conjures up emotion seemingly effortlessly. His guitar work is not virtuoso but confident and rocking and to sing and play like that is another element of Martin's gifts. The range is wide here with musical styles but it is all Tea Party and they are relentless. Martin always keeps things light though with his twisted humor and has the crowd lol at times. Pretty mellow crowd the Aussies but I think it is tough for a band to bring the dynamic change that Tea Party music has and have the crowd shift with it. Must have for Tea Party fans.,1363046400,5,712,4.442748091603053
5340445,5,B009INAH58,"There aren't many live dvd's of the Tea Party so this makes this dvd even more precious. It is a great show, great performance. Tea party at is best!!",1363046400,,150,4.206896551724138
5340446,5,B009INAH58,"Back for good....so they say and I can't believe how well they kicked off their reformation of the band. During the summer of 2012, Canadian rock trio The Tea Party embarked on a tour of Australia.

Canadian fans adore them, as much so does the rest of the world, especially ""down under"". Recorded at The Hordern Pavilion in Sydney, this concert DVD brings new life to all your favorite hits from the bands extensive catalog.

Pretty much just picking up where they left off, singing their classics as if they have kept touring since 2005. Martin's vocals are in fine form and this DVD showcases a band bursting with renewed energy.

The Tea Party...

Jeff Burrows - drums, percussion, backing vocals
Stuart Chatwood - bass, keyboards, harmonium, mandolin, acoustic guitar, backing vocals
Jeff Martin - guitar, acoustic guitar, theremin, esraj, oud, bowed

They have been around for approximately 20 years and after a 7 year hiatus they are back with their latest offering, a ""Live from Australia - The Reformation Tour."" I guess the endless support and pressure from their fans to put it all together again was more than any band could wish for, so they made their fan's dreams come true.

One week prior to The Tea Party's show at the Hordern Pavilion, Sydney on July 21, 2012 they announced they would be filming the concert for a live Blu-ray/DVD release, when they reminded the audience in attendance every face in the Pavillion lit up.

What more can I say, the band is awesome, and as usual always at the top of their game. Jeff Martin oozes charisma,throughout the performance and especially during the acoustic numbers. His laid back style, fluid hand gestures and confidence makes this the celebration to remember. Owning this concert DVD is a must have for all Tea Party fans.

Hopefully they'll get back to their roots and create more of the music that made them such a huge success.

Long Live, ""Moroccan Roll"".",1362268800,,1924,4.806060606060606
5340447,5,B009INAH58,Jeff Martin is right! Women are the better half. My wife turned me on to these guys a few years ago knowing I was a big Zep and Doors fan! Its like having the best of both worlds but make no mistake Tea Party put their own style on this wonderful DVD. Songs like The River and Save Me for me at least sound better live than on record. The sound on this DVD is incredible and as good as ay DVD I have minus Pulse. For those of you who say these guys are lame or unoriginal get over yourselves! This DVD is true Rock N Roll the way it should be. Jeff is a great host and his comments are both whitty and funny to listen too. For a three piece the sound is big and Zeppelinesque in a GOOD way. Jeff Burrows and Stuart Chatwood are a powehouse rythym section and compliment the multi talented Martin well.. They are back he says for good! Lets hope that is true and for a very long time!,1359849600,5,883,3.966292134831461
5340448,5,B009INAH58,I remember back years ago hearing some pretty good songs by The Tea Party but that was the extent of it. Always on the look-out for concert blue-rays to watch on the home-theater I decided to pick this one up. Great decision. This one packs the Wow factor & makes me wonder why I don't have a single one of their albums. These guys are totally under-rated & this b/ray delivers top-notch audio & video. Play this one LOUD & enjoy the trip.,1359763200,4,439,4.301204819277109
5340449,5,B009INAH58,If you like the Tea Party you will be happy with this. Beauty music and beauty stache on Jeff. Still.,1356739200,,101,4.1
5340450,4,B009INAH58,"Ahhhh, this really brings back the memories! Fond recollections of the Tea Party playing several smokin' concerts in very small clubs here in Burlington, Vermont (in fact, their debut album ""Splendor Solis"" was recorded right here!) I always thought they were an absolutely killer band live, but all along, there was no live album or video concert to remember them by - until now! In front of a packed Aussie audience of rabid fans, the band rips through a selection of songs from just about every phase of their career, and even includes a nice acoustic-based set. But as I've wondered many times before, why these guys never took over the world is beyond me! A combination of Led Zep crunch (along with a similar bent towards Middle-Eastern textures) with a singer who more often than not sounds a lot like Jim Morrison fronting a hard-rock band, these guys have been making great albums, and performing kickass shows for years, yet have remained relatively unknown enough to lead them to their inevitable break-up a few years ago. While several of Jeff Martin's solo outings have been good-to-great, this set really reminded me of how perfect the three of these guys are together - and how they haven't missed a step in-between (besides, few threesomes could ever pull off what they do in concert: just check out Stuart Chatwood's dexterity on bass guitar, keyboards and bass pedals!) Martin announces that they are ""back for good"", and that is GREAT news. Maybe now, the world will discover that they have simply been a bit ahead of their time! My only (slight) complaint would be: too much of Martin's between-song banter - but that's not enough to detract from anything here. If you miss big, creative, 70's-based riffs and powerful vocals, these guys are the real deal: live (as on this DVD, which by the way, is great in sound and picture), or in the studio.",1356652800,9,1866,4.780185758513932
5340451,5,B009INAH58,I have been a huge fan of this amazing band since Splendor Solis and have always dreamed of a live dvd/cd since seeing them live on their Seven Circles tour. The set list is great and the band is in top form from start to finish. It's great to see these guys back in solid shape and performing so well its like they never left. The companion live album is excellent too. Welcome back guys \m/  Hail The Tea Party \m/,1355270400,2,416,4.135802469135802
8541963,5,B009INAH58,"I watched this on YouTube prior to ordering it.. this band is so underrated its crazy. Having grown up in Michigan, I heard quite a bit of The Tea Party. They are by far the best there is. I wish I could have seen them in concert back in the day but the one show I had tickets too was canceled. Now that I live in Virginia, Ive introduced quite a few people to this phenomenal band.",1514678400,,382,3.9740259740259742
8541964,5,B009INAH58,I do not care where they have been or where they are going (just kidding).Thank You for the Great Music. I really mean that. I will always be a fan. DVD was perfect. I mean perfect.,1509148800,,181,4.055555555555555
8541965,5,B009INAH58,"A band that never seemed to break big in the u.s. and I have no idea why.
This is a great document of the return of the tea party (No, nothing to do with politics). The show has been shot in hd , with good results.  The audio is dts master audio 5.1 (There is no stereo track). The production quality is very high.
The show is excellent. The band is firing on all cylinders and quite playful. All the greats that fans will know are played. There are some minor rearrangements, but not to the detriment of the tunes.
For those of you who don't know the band, they are kind of zepplinesque  (but certainly not clones) and most say jeff martin sounds a little him morrison(ish).
Well worth checking out and essential for the fan.",1504396800,,726,4.291970802919708
8541966,5,B009INAH58,"Great song selection, sounds like being at a Tea Party concert.  This is one of my favorite live recordings of any group.",1453420800,,121,4.5
8541967,4,B009INAH58,"Great item, although the sound was not to my standards for a blu-ray disc. Must have encoding issues. Mr. Martin should understand with his perfect pitch how this would undermine a fan's total home experience. Many others to question (sound engineers etc.) down the line of course, but for something to last for eternity, I know that I would want it as perfect as the technology of the day would allow. With no exceptions. Peace.",1428451200,,429,4.733333333333333
8541968,5,B009INAH58,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Almost as good as being at the show live. Yes, it's a live show from 2 different cities, but who cares. It rocks. All the classic Tea Party hits are played, plenty of banter with the audience.. just buy it already! For true fans, you will not be disappointed, even my 7 year old wants me to play it for her.",1419206400,,338,4.136363636363637
