7673533,5,B01CDT63BK,"Centurions Part 2 is the final DVD set for the Centurions series and all remaining episodes were present and all discs and episodes worked.
Ive watched them all and there were no technical issues aside from original technical issues to the episodes themselves such as missing background cells.there are several crazy ones towards the end of the series. (Ive watched over a 1,000 80s cartoon episodes and Ive never seen frames missing backgrounds or missing animations like this show!)
The episodes are still remastered and look absolutely amazing.

The PSA are really well done for PSAs to the point of shockingly good. Not sure why more effort or resources weren't allocated to trying to get them all on DVD even if they were not attached to each episode. Theyre some of the best PSAs by way of content and animation that Ive ever seen. Science Lesson: Micro-technology by Crystal is surprisingly interesting to watch in 2016.

This was a treat to watch and if you can watch Traitors Three please do. It blew me away. Excellent episode, if not the best cartoon episode Ive ever seen.

If you don't have any of the Centurions sets and are into 80s toon I highly advise you to check out Centurions. In my opinion this is a really underrated 80s show.",1463961600,3,2538,4.754545454545455

7673537,5,B01CDT63BK,"I just got mine in the mail today and I'm watching it as I write this.  This is just like Part One.  You should know the drill by now.  3 DVDs with 10 episodes on each disc.  It is remastered and they did the digital makeover.  Looks excellent on HDTVs.  Same packaging as well.  Having disc 2 on top of disc 3. So to get disc 3 out you first have to remove disc 2.  As usual I just switched the case.  No educational parts at the end of each episode either.  Part Two holds a special place for me because it has all my favorite childhood episodes:  Traitors Three, Novice, Cyborg Centurion, Zone Dancer, Breakout, The Better Half 1&2.  As far as I'm concerned Zone Dancer, The Better Half 1&2 and Cyborg Centurion are worth the buy by themselves.  Really good episodes there.  This is very kid friendly and filled with lots of action.  Enjoy folks.  WB Archive listened to us and brought Centurions to our home.  I thank them for that.  Please finish Mister T.  Treat the Smurfs properly and give us season treatments like you are doing with the Snorks, WB Archive.",1458086400,10,1066,4.374358974358974
