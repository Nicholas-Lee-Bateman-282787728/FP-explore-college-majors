1203493,2,B00000F5XZ,"This listing has Klaus Maria Brandauer staring but on the jewel case cover Barry Newman is listed as star. I tried three issues of this movie and the same error was on everyone of them. You order this, hoping you get Brandauer, but Newman you'll get.

1203494,5,B00000F5XZ,I had read the book in the 1970's because I had been in Salzburg at that time. When the movie came out it was a must see. At the time filming was film but his still did not take away from the story and the intrigue. When it came out on DVD it was a must have. It was also a chance to see Salzburg in the early 70's. The autos made a wonderful return to classic  history.,1390348800,3,370,3.7435897435897436

1203497,1,B00000F5XZ,"I'm reading that Fox Cinema Archive has chosen to release The Salzburg Connection in a cropped 1.33:1 original aspect ratio, not the original 1.85:1 OAR. Fox needs to take their cue from Warner Archive. They, at least, care about the integrity of their made on demand releases.",1377388800,9,277,4.914893617021277

1203499,3,B00000F5XZ,"After 'Vanishing Point' and 'Fear Is the Key,' Barry Newman is involved in another auto-chase, but this time with a distinct difference... The baddies, not strictly gangsters but hoodlums with Nazi connections, have kidnapped Anna Karina for some dirty purpose and are driving away with her through busy city streets...

Newman, an American lawyer on holiday in Salzburg, finds himself suspected by spies of both sides... He chases the kidnap-car by continually managing to get in front of it (the high speed scenes), then slowing down to cause a traffic jam and attract the attention of the police...

Klaus Maria Brandauer makes his film debut here, before his appearance in 'Mephisto,' Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Film in 1981...",1234224000,4,734,5.159663865546219
1203500,4,B00000F5XZ,"I am a huge fan of Helen MacInnes' work and would love to see all 4 of the movies based on her books.  Unfortunately, only 2 made it on video.  I now own both and am not disappointed with either one.
While this movie does seem dated to today's eyes, it is a good movie.  MacInnes' books are extremely meaty and, while not all could be translated to screen, this does a good job of staying true to the story w/o using everything from the book.  I also think that those who have no interest in the book would still enjoy the story, although not if you can't appreciate the fact that it is dated by today's standards.",1016496000,22,614,4.177966101694915

Realistic spy thriller that requires concentrating on who is revealed to be who as the story progresses. A thinking man's mystery/thriller.",1494201600,,298,5.340425531914893

7907075,1,B00000F5XZ,"Dull espionage drama finds a lawyer (Barry Sullivan) vacationing in Salzburg running an errand for an employer that embroils him intrigue with Neo-Nazis that is never very intriguing.  This is the least interesting by far of the 1970's films that used aging Nazis or Neo-Nazis as villains (The Odessa File; The Boys From Brazil; Marathon Man).  Part of the problem is that it takes nearly two thirds of the film to find out what everyone is getting killed over so you end up spending the film's first hour either bored or confused--and then when you do finally find out it's most definitely not worth the wait.  Barry Sullivan's lawyer reacts as the audience is likely to--why are people actually killing each other over this?--which suggests strongly that the filmmakers knew the big reveal was dramatically unsatisfying.  Even The Holcroft Covenant, a late to the party 1985 effort where Michael Cain gets sucked into a Neo-Nazi plot which is considered by many to be a low point in director John Frankenheimer's uneven career is about a thousand times more lively than this one.  Watch late at night if you are having trouble sleeping.",1440806400,,1138,4.90625
7907076,3,B00000F5XZ,"This 1972 film, based on a Helen MacInnes novel, is a rather understated espionage melodrama.  An American attorney visiting Salzburg finds himself caught up in a web of intrigue after some hidden records dating from World War II are uncovered.  The emphasis is on plot and intrigue rather than action, although the film does include a car chase and a cliffhanger scene on a ski lift.  Although much more restrained than more recent espionage movies, there are some good elements, notably a solid plot and aesthetic visuals, emphasizing the beauty of the Austrian alps.",1438819200,2,569,5.031914893617022
7907077,3,B00000F5XZ,"I had just re-read the book and wanted to see the movie again, after 40 years.  The book was very good, again, but I thought the movie was just okay.  It was fun and interesting to see the familiar sights of Salzburg in the 1970's; I visited many times during that period and in the years since then.  Several shots were in front of the old American Express Office, where we used to pick up mail while travelling.  As beautiful as Salzburg and the lakes are, the color was a bit washed out in the movie.  The movie followed the book, but it would have been too complicated for a movie to follow it completely, so come characters were left out and the ending was totally different.  They maintained the suspense of the book.  If you don't have a connection to Salzburg or the book, I probably would give it a miss; if you're going down Nostalgia Lane, it's worth a look.",1430352000,4,869,4.327160493827161

7907080,3,B00000F5XZ,"Honestly, I did not care for this film when it was first released. Barry Newman was sort of a hot item overnight in sort of a cult way. That is why I went to see THE SALZBURG CONNECTION. The film has a good premise and it has a style that doesn't quite work and ultimately it wasn't exactly what many of us were expecting from Barry Newman. Looking back, it fits into that era of film making, which I think was was looking for some direction. It was good to see it again and if you are a Barry Newman fan you can enjoy seeing him again in his prime.",1413763200,,549,4.0
