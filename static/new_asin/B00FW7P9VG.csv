8618886,3,B00FW7P9VG,I have wanted to hear the complete score to this since hearing the suite from over 25 years ago. Respighi was going to made a 2nd suite of the music but died. So what we had was just the 23 minutes of music he edited. The complete ballet is 80 minutes long so there was a lot of music to be heard. This is the first time the complete score has been played since 1932. Unfortunately the rest of the unheard music is not very interesting with the exception of about 3 minutes from the end of act 4 and 4 minutes from the end of act 6. The rest (with the exception of the music already used for the suite) is very low key and not what you would expect to hear at all. The performance as recorded here is lackluster with no real fire or passion-the players looked bored. Needed a conductor that could whip them into a passionate performance. The camera work is very good on the blue ray and the sound is clear but not very dynamic. I am glad that someone finally recorded the complete ballet. What someone needs to do is extract the best of the unheard music and edit it into a 2nd suite as Respighi planned.. NOTE: This is a Region Free blu ray and will play on any machine. It says so right on the cover. So ignore Amazon's warning about it being Region 2 only.,1493251200,,1259,4.142857142857143
