8431418,4,B004IZJL6C,"Great DVD - bad, incomplete set list on the cover.  Was very disappointed when I got it and read it, but was very pleased the cover was incomplete & disc had everything I wanted on it.  Cool extras.  One concert has a homemade, unprofessional look to it, but I kinda like it that way.",1454025600,,284,4.222222222222222

8431420,5,B004IZJL6C,"Big GNR and STP fan. This band was great. My kids recently found them and ask for the first album in the car, so, I searched to see if there was anything I missed. Concert for first album and second. Bonus features include an overview of a Brazilian tour with four songs at a lower quality. The German concert looks like it might have been filmed for PAL and converted as the motion is off a bit, but still good show.

Plays on my Sony Blu-ray player and HDTV in the United States--don't know what the disc details are about talking about DVD and not playing in USA",1432512000,,565,4.231481481481482
8431421,3,B004IZJL6C,"I'm a big VR/STP fan, so I had to have this.  It has all of your favorites, but it has several that you will probably want to skip past.  Best line in the show - ""We were all working really hard on getting sober, but we had to take a break from sobriety to do a tour."" Scott Weiland",1355529600,,282,3.76271186440678
8431422,5,B004IZJL6C,Will work on US blu ray players...excellent concert.. 2 concerts for the price of 1 Highly recommended. Love Slash!! amazing guitar player.. Concert Rocks,1342569600,,154,5.458333333333333
