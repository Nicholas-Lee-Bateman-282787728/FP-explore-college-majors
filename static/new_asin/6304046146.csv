7861188,5,6304046146,"This is to some extent a must own playboy dvd
It's the young MTV's Singled Out Jenny McCarthy
Not the insane self-import reality show star mom you get now
If you grew up in the 1990's your wanna have this interesting time capsule
It's a strange thing to view now It's out of print cause Playboy no longer believes in re-releasing any back catalog videos
but, you can still pick it up for a decent price (I've seen it at a Pawn Shop for less then $10.00) so you never know
You can also buy it in the Playboy Best of 3 Disc Combo Pack (with Pam Anderson & Anna Nicole Smith)
This is without a doubt a real must own PB Release (When PB actually put out HQ Products)
One massive plus she doesn't try to be funny and do her dumb blonde gimmick thing  9.5/10",1444780800,,752,4.115646258503402

Then I bought this one--Jenny's even HOTTER in this DVD --The red dress segment, waiting for a ride buy the old well water pump--Ay, Marron --almost burnt up my T V screen --If your a true Jenny McCarthy fan--you NEED this DVD!!!",1404172800,,329,4.593220338983051

7861191,2,6304046146,I'm a fan but I guess I expected different. Too cheesy for me...I guess she was meant to be seen and not heard/narrated. Go for her in lingerie only. This was more of her rambling and reading off her bio.,1356480000,,204,4.125

7861193,5,6304046146,"Playboy / Best of Jenny McCarthy is fifty-seven minutes long and was released on DVD on February 13, 2001. Of the three Best of videos this is one of the better ones. Only two minutes is dedicated to her early life and how she went on to become Playmate of the Month then Playmate of the Year. The rest of the video is showing her in different scenes taking off her clothes and showing herself in the nude. Pamela Anderson in her The Best of video was very conservative about showing herself in the nude and her video was more of question and answer video. The only scenes that I hated were the race track, angel, and pool hall. All the other shorts the clothes came off. Only wish we could have seen her more in her birthday suit. One final note is that there is no difference from the VHS version. Playboy / Best of Jenny McCarthy get an A-.

7861194,4,6304046146,"Jenny, I don't know you but your body looks amazing, you're photogenic as hell, and your face looks royal. A pity you signed up for this video that sports an 80's corny everything, and sits between two stools: ""soft porn"" and ""family values, American style"" :). Ah, your boobs are amazing, it's true that your hair looks ""yellow"", as that modeling agent told you, but if she really thought you were overweight, she will be green with envy every time she watches this video. (True to fact, in one of the magazine pictures, your face looks rather plumpy).

What's in the box: This videos, for those who don't know them yet, are not anywhere near ""porn"". They mix with variable success ""funny"" scenes, puritan full nudes, beautiful scenery, semi nudes, interviews with the star, her family (!), the photographer (!), some playboy moguls (who look creepy and sleazy), 4 models having a shower in the semi dark, a photo editor whose nose looks like Michael Jackson's (""Marilyn Grabowski"", if you wanna know), that sort of thing.
Did you get it? I still don't, but that's how it works :).

A very personal view: My favourite scene is number 10, ""A video success"". Really HOT. In fact, that's the ""beauty"" of Playboy DVDs: showing while not showing, creating ""a story"" where the playmate can feel sort of at ease. It makes one wonder, if real porn would have half the quality of this, and women half as beautiful, we'd all be watching :), I guess. SO, it's probably better that porn is always crappy and playboy DVDs are way too ""soft"", right :)?

While it's true there's nothing ""spontaneous"" in these heavily edited videos, if you listen to her, she does seem to think some of the script she's given. Like: ""I'd like to travel to some exotic places. I think that travelling a lot can add an air of mystery to a person"" (sic).

If you didn't get to see the magazine pictures (like me), this videos show them all, panning slowly.

Style: The voice is hateable after 5', and the 80's music and visuals are so cheesy they're almost funny. Off putting perhaps, but I guess they could be used for understanding ""how we were"" in a sort of ""cultural studies"" way.

""Jenny is an American"": They mentioned 3 times the ""South of Chicago"" stuff. Funny, how us who look at the USA from abroad tend not to realize what a stratified society America is. You'd say: ""Who on earth would be thinking about sociology looking at such woman?"". Well, Playboy DVDs manage to do just that :).

Conclusion: If you want ""fast"" erotica this is definitely not it. If you get them cheap, they may be worth the space. Don't get me wrong, they're excellently made for their ""genre"", but the problem is, I guess 99% of us guys want to have a look at women, not looking at flowers nor horses, jockeys carrying her in their arms, then she, the former tomboy, carrying one in hers. And so on. This should be divided: ""action"" and ""story"". Well, OK, ""who would watch the story""? and ""Who can sustain interest for 6O', without ""fillers""? Ok, granted. And yet...

If only she hadn't dyed her hair, I'd pay the U$S 18, and, probably, so should you :).",1252022400,,3106,4.563734290843806
