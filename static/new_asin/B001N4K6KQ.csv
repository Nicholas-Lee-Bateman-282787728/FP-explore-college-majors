3710895,5,B001N4K6KQ,"I know it's not politically correct to make entertainment even a factor when discussing a movie about a serious subject like this - but this movie is proof that you can tell people what they need to know while keeping them glued to the picture. In fact nothing is quite so fascinating as the truth when it is told with honesty and by people who are passionate about the subject. If you want to learn what the problem is, why the problem is, and even how we might go about solving the problem you need to watch this.

This is one of those movies that can actually get you to change your behavior. It made me more aware of my impact.",1239235200,8,631,4.214876033057851
3710896,5,B001N4K6KQ,"You hear the term ""Peak Oil"" and you may think you know what it means. To truly understand where we are TODAY, the doc Crude Impact is a must-see. Finally a doc that sounds the alarm BEFORE it's too late. Wake up. Watch this film.",1239235200,4,230,4.133333333333334
3710897,5,B001N4K6KQ,"I loved this film and found it every bit as useful as Al Gore's movie.  An absolute ""must see"" to understand some of the issues facing us today.",1239235200,4,144,4.142857142857143
3710898,5,B001N4K6KQ,"This is a gripping documentary on the subject of peak oil--a sobering account of our dependence on ancient sunlight to power industrial civilization and the consequences we face as we top over the global oil production peak and enter the irreversible depletion phase. While there are other documentaries that treat the subject, I find Crude Impact notable, among other reasons, for its focus from the outset on the relationship between the size of the human population and the increasingly intensive extraction of resources.

I teach a semester-long high school seminar devoted entirely to peak oil and this is the documentary, among other excellent documentaries on this subject, which I have chosen for viewing by my students. Crude Impact is simply the clearest exposition of peak oil and its far-reaching consequences. The impact has been profound.

Interviews with leading experts in a variety of related fields forward the narrative, which is accompanied by arresting images, a judicious use of graphics, and haunting musical score. Indeed the concept of peak oil itself is not fully expanded until later in the documentary after an array economic, political, social, and economic threads are systematically explored--and the full impact of peak oil then becomes frighteningly clear.

If you are new to the notion of peak oil, this is a must view which should be shared with relatives and friends. In fact, it should be shared with everyone, even those already ""peak oil aware,"" which I fear is all too few. Crude Impact is an impressive, if deeply disturbing, documentary.",1239148800,22,1579,5.208661417322834
3710899,5,B001N4K6KQ,"This is a very well done documentary that will get your attention.  This film hits all important areas; the environment, sustainability and social justice.  My life changed in a very positive way after seeing this hard hitting movie.  A must see for our times!",1239062400,3,260,4.863636363636363

8323173,5,B001N4K6KQ,"I don't think that this topic has been properly understood by some reviewers. Let me make this very clear: it is impossible to speak meaningfully of Peak Oil or the End of Cheap and Efficient Oil (or good ERoEI, Energy Returned on Energy Invested) without speaking of population growth and all manner of other aspects of the human society. Why? Because Oil or fossil fuels in general are the only reason there is 7 Billion instead of 500 million humans and why society has grown to be so complex or globalised. It's the only reason that the earth stands a great chance of becoming largely uninhabitable in the next century due to global warming and other environmental disasters like loss of soil and clean drinking water, among many others. Bottom line actually is: this IS a film about peak oil which does and extraordinary and necessary job of relating it to its wider implications and discusses them with stark realism and honesty. Peak oil as a geological phenomenon does not have leftist or rightist agendas it has nothing to do with politics. It's a hard physical fact that we are at the end of cheap, abundant, efficient fossil fuels. What directs societies, and this should be emphasised, is not some political regime or party, but the amount of surplus energy availed to be used for growth. Then all else follows, economic, industrial and so on. Even if Hitler was ruling the world today we would still be in the same mess (perhaps not if Buddha had been though!) And these people speaking in this DVD are explaining the outcomes of this fact. It should be noted that these people speaking in this DVD are among the foremost commentators in the world on such issues and are worth the attention of any prudent adult who wishes to understand the human project more fully. This is a great film for newcomers to a topic that needs to be herd and understood by every human being that is will effect. Which is most people who live in industrialised ereas. There are many other DVDs out there that talk in isolation about such topics but this does a rather good job of unifying the larger picture by starting with the root: Oil or fossil fuels. Please watch this DVD. Here is a link to watch the whole film:

[...]
I hope more people can become aware of the predicament that humans face in the near future. There more one looks into the topics of peak oil, climate change and the economy the more one sees that we are on a crash course with no life lines! It does not take a maths genius or a great amount of logic and reason to see for oneself.",1315785600,,2548,4.5271149674620395
8323174,3,B001N4K6KQ,"Overall I think this dvd just portrays one side of the story, Im not an oil industry fan but objectively I consider this dvd to be somewhat partial on the matter.",1283126400,2,162,4.258064516129032
8323175,5,B001N4K6KQ,It is impossible to see this film and not begin to rethink the way we live. Crude Impact deal with one of the most critically important issues of our time. The film's scope and impact are far-reaching and very timely. Crude Impact deserves to be on everyone's top 10 must-see documentaries.,1244678400,,290,4.705882352941177
8323176,5,B001N4K6KQ,"This is an amazing, eye-opening film about Peak Oil. It's extremely informative and sounds the alarm about the importance of using alternative forms of energy. Buy this film and share it with your friends. That's how I first viewed it -- at a friend's home...and afterward we talked for hours about its content.",1240444800,3,311,4.886792452830188
8323177,3,B001N4K6KQ,"I've read a couple of books regarding peak oil, and so was interested in seeing this documentary.  I must honestly say that this film exceeds its mandate of discussing the impact of consumption and peak oil on our lifestyle and planet.

After establishing well the reality of the impending peak oil crisis that we will face unless we change our practices, the film quickly moves on to tackling other subjects and agendas.  Very quickly the subject turns to population control, consumerism, and globalization.  Sure, the tentacles of oil policy reach far and wide, but I got the impression from the complete shift in focus that rather than viewing valid supporting arguments, I was seeing the filmmakers' original intent for the documentary in the first place.  Perspective viewers are brought to this film expecting to see a documentary on peak oil, but instead end up watching a two hour dialogue about globalization and American hegemony.  Those subjects are certainly worth discussing, but don't tell me that I'm going to be watching a film about peak oil and then start talking about population control and globalism.

One interview subject declares that even if we found tomorrow a green technology that would eliminate completely the need for fossil fuels, our lifestyle would be unsustainable and that we need to make drastic changes.  And off we go!  No longer talking about peak oil, we're talking about corporate abuse, the military industrial complex, overpopulation, and every other leftist cause under the sun.  If this documentary is intended for the active supporters of those positions, then great.  But if it is intended to inform passive supporters, folks that are neutral, or even those in passive opposition, then this total shift in focus will alienate people and turn them off to the entire film--including its supposedly central focus of peak oil.

Bottom line, this isn't a film about peak oil.  It is a film about a broader leftist agenda, with a slight focus on peak oil.  Watching this film reminds of me of the anti-war protests in which I frequently participate.  We're out there in opposition of the war in Iraq, but you've got the ""free mumias,"" the ""end corporate greedesters,"" the ""anti-capitalists,"" the anarchists, the hippies, etc.  As a consequence, the entire experience is cheapened and diluted.",1240099200,21,2334,5.086614173228346
8323178,5,B001N4K6KQ,"I am glad to see this documentary available and hope many people will watch this film and feel its effects. Indeed, in a way that is similar to Inconvenient Truth, this film should and will change the way we think and act and when we are challenged to think about our actions, it is not always convenient. But many of us are craving a responsible, informed way to live our lives on the planet. The messages of Crude IMpact help direct us to deeper thinking about how to forge a more sustainable, more simple life with greater meaning causing fewer irreversible harms. Thanks for more of the Truth.",1239667200,,597,4.537037037037037
8323179,5,B001N4K6KQ,"An interesting, informative and entertaining film that commanded my attention throughout its viewing. It also serves as a warning that we must move quickly toward, and support the development of, alternative forms of energy. Share this with your already formed groups (i.e., church or reading groups, social networks, etc.) - watching together is a great way to continue or start a discussion about energy, conservation, and social justice.",1239321600,,440,5.485294117647059
8323180,5,B001N4K6KQ,"I was at the screening when the film premiered on IDFA 2 years ago. The entire audience came out after the screening, to continue discussing the matter with the director in the hallway for another hour. I've never seen people so moved by an environmental film, and motivated to spread it's message. Truely a must see",1239321600,8,316,4.660714285714286
8323181,5,B001N4K6KQ,"This is a very important film. The media has yet to fully embrace the reality of what this story reveals, mostly because the media is energy illiterate. Cuba has already begun living a ""peak oil"" type of living standard that is extreme, due to the embargo and sanctions. They would experience a needed relief w/o those barriers. We too, will be reduced to a ""lower"" living standard than we are used to w/o such embargoes. We had better begin learning to live differently, with Cuba showing us what it may look like. There are, however, silver linings in this scenario, in that life can be reconfigured to be much more rewarding and less ""dog eat dog"" and predatory. If we have the imagination, we can get through the coming transition. See this film and find out.",1239235200,3,763,4.617647058823529
