7906689,4,B00000F22V,"This fun title has been heavily bootlegged.  If you see it on sale as a DVD, it's a cheap copy.  Unfortunately, illegal copies of this movie on tape (usually claiming to be an x-rental in hard case) are also being sold.  This rare movie is valued at about $40, if you see it for less, read the seller's condition comments carefully.  Be sure to look for words like 'original' or 'authentic' in the seller's listing, words that a bootlegger rarely uses.  I ordered this movie, and instead a cheap copy that didn't even play well came in the mail.  I have included a picture of it on the product page- the bootleg on the left and an authentic tape on the right for comparison.  Just click on 'see all 2 customer images' to see how to recognize a bootleg so you won't get ripped off like I was!",1223596800,6,791,4.304054054054054
7906690,4,B00000F22V,"""All The Marbles"" (or at one point called ""The California Dolls"") is one of our families favorite movies.  My brother, can watch this movie over and over and over.  I think he knows most of the dialogue.  I hope this comes on DVD soon.  I have a copy on VHS that I taped off of TV years ago.  I did convert it to a DVD format, but still not the greatest quality.  Hopefully sometime soon, the studio will release a DVD.  Until then, I'll just keep watching my VHS or homemade DVD.  Love the end - Double Sunset flip - LOL!!!",1207872000,4,524,4.118811881188119
7906691,4,B00000F22V,"Yes this is a very fun and completely original story, with some very good filmamking. Just by the popularity of this item on EBAY and the outragous prices old video store copies of this movie is being sold for should justify a DVD release.

I have not seen this movie for some time, and I truly look forward to the eventual DVD release so I can again enjoy it and add it to my library.

Cant give it 5 start because it is a B movie, and there are flaws, but it's great fun, and even inspiring.",1112832000,7,493,4.072164948453608
7906692,5,B00000F22V,Why hasn't this awesome film by Peter Falk released on DVD?,1111449600,9,59,4.454545454545454
7906693,5,B00000F22V,"You would think that simply the huge popularity of wrestling in this country would lead Hollywood to consider again releasing this film on video or on DVD for the first time.  This would be reason enough, as it has been in the past for way too many films that deserved to be ignored, like, say, those abominable spy films from the 60s rereleased because of the success of the Austin Powers series.  But this is an excellent film in every way and merits release.  The acting, story, photography, and the other creative contributions fit together beautifully in a film that will engage you, inspire you, and move you.  Peter Falk, always superb, leads a female wrestling team through several years of struggle against corrupt managers, dishonest competitors, and their own emotional failings until they finally achieve the top position in the wrestling world by winning a final spectacular match.  It's a journey you will be happy you took with them, believe me.  Yes, this film will make you smile, cheer, and  weep, but, mostly, it will make you see again that where there is hope, there is life.  And we all need to be reminded of that, especially these days.",1030060800,34,1160,4.765
