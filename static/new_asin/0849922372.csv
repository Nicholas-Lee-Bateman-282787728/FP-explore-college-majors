171281,5,0849922372,"We are restless because God made us to leave fingerprints that reflect His glory. We're often too afraid for the discomfort that comes, so we sometimes hide instead of pursuing hope. Jennie suggests that we were made for purpose and commissions us to take the threads of our lives -- the deliberateness of who we were created to be . . . our strengths, talents, and passions -- and ""go live"" like there is more, because as Jennie says ""there is [more].""

This isn't just another *go pursue your dream* kind of book. It's a charge. It's a sharing honestly of the human tendency to hold back and a hand-reaching out to say ""let's do this together . . . in spite of our fear"" because this is how we will rest.",1389052800,24,706,4.348484848484849
171282,5,0849922372,"Within the first two chapters, it is obvious that Jennie Allen is in her sweet spot. She is passionate about women chasing after the will of God and this book demonstrates that. She uses her light-hearted vocabulary to encourage women in real ways about real things. She keeps me completely engaged and ready to learn about the ""threads"" that God is using in my own life.",1388966400,22,371,4.636363636363637
171283,4,0849922372,"I received a copy of this DVD set at no cost from the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.

This is an interesting review because I have viewed the 8 session video lessons alone without the aid of the study guide or book. My review can only be based on this information. I do know my appetite is whetted for more after viewing. It seems that the study that accompanies this will be helpful to those who desire to see God in the mundane of life. The book appears to focus more specifically on the life of Joseph, though the video is more application to the viewers everyday life.

I have to be honest, I like Jennie Allen. I am thrilled to see her desire to lead women in making a difference in our generation with our specific God-given strengths, talents and abilities. This video is made with a fresh, contemporary style that makes it interesting and easy to watch. There is a small group of women who are viewing the authors teaching. At the beginning of each session there is a question that several women try to answer regarding their lives based on the following lesson (Again, having the study guide would have helped here I believe). There are eight sessions lasting about 20 minutes each. Jennie's teaching is passionate and clear about making Jesus the center of our lives. It is good material that will spurn your walk forward in the Lord.

I believe this would be beneficial to do alongside a small group of women with the use of the study guide or book. It would be a good starting point for further discussion as to how these topics relate individually to the women in the group, in turn those women can encourage one another accordingly to be all they are meant to be in HIM.",1388966400,6,1700,4.459807073954984

171289,5,0849922372,Absolutely love this book. Well written and thought out! So glad I took the time to read this. Don't miss out. Content is too valuable!!!!!!!!,1494460800,,142,4.72
171290,3,0849922372,"This is not a bad book. Nor is it particularly poorly written. I just think it is a bit misguided.

This is my first Jennie Allen book and, after reading many glowing reviews (and a couple of not so glowing ones), I was ready to jump right in. I am no stranger to journaling (I understood from a review or two that this would be necessary) so I was poised to dig, journal and discover what it means to dream again -- all with Jennie Allen cheering me along the way.

And thats exactly what she does. Early on in the book, I felt understood -- after all, she too was a wife and mom who struggled with a sense of purpose and that restless feeling we all seem to get in our lives at some point or another. Jennie felt like a friend who understood (who would love to be discussing your hopes and dreams over coffee right this instant, but simply couldnt), and the conversational tone of this book makes it both engaging and easy to read. Jennie is nothing if not sincere. She sincerely wants you to realize that God has uniquely equipped you with gifts, and she sincerely wants you to passionately pursue Gods call and purpose for your life.

And these are very good things. The journaling activities are meant to help you discern what your giftings and calling might be. You were asked to write about your own story, highlighting unique instances when you felt joy and delight in what you were doing, and she also directs you to see how God might use suffering in your life to fuel your passions or to enable you to help others who suffer. She encourages you to write about the places you encounter regularly and how you might live more meaningfully and purposefully as you engage with those places. In short, she helps you to connect the dots of your life: your gifts, the people in your life who need you (and whom you need), the suffering you have endured, the places you regularly encounter and the passions you have all to help you pinpoint what your purpose might be.

And she cheers you, she is behind you, and she shares countless stories about countless, amazing friends who have died, come back to life or almost died and who now are living lives on mission, and she wants to help you to do the same -- to not miss it, or to bury the gifts God has given you because of fear. She lived that way for a while, but now she is running hard toward God and, incidentally, so is her husband, Zac, who wasn't always on board with her pursuing her dreams. But now says he is.

Chapter 21, When Women Dream, is where my former enthusiasm began to unravel. Framed a certain way, it seems possible to justify almost anything. Being away from your four children for extended periods of traveling and working is perfectly acceptable so long as you are doing it for the kingdom. Why should we have any less access to pursuing our dreams than our husbands do? After all, God gave us dreams and giftings too. This sounds eerily like a Christianized version of a worldly ideology. It made me feel like Jennie was using a very old, yet cleverly disguised strategy: God didn't really say Why else would she basically say it was okay for her to charge full speed ahead in her career (with what she feels is Gods approval, of course), candidly admit that sometimes her husband feels eclipsed and that she often absent in the home (to the extent that she gets help from sitters, cleaners and administrative assistance) with absolutely no reference to Titus 2:5 whatsoever?

I am also concerned that what is being further eclipsed here is the matter of daily, ordinary, unsung faithfulness. Attention to the common, boring, monotonous, unremarkable with remarkable regularity, devotion, a daily (often moment-by-moment) dying to self for the sake of others -- not for praise we may receive presently, nor the thrill or sudden rush of knowing we are walking in our purpose, but out of sincere devotion to Christ and out of our love for Him. I am concerned that women reading this book will think their purpose out there somewhere -- something they must leave to do or look for somewhere else. Often what is required of us is right beneath our noses, but fails to look appealing, because we are fickle mortals and our restless feelings are often still just feelings, and we should be wise in how we respond to them, interpret them, and where we allow them to lead us.

I also believe that simple discontentment is a far greater issue that people in general, and women in particular, grapple with. We Christians are not exempt from the inner tuggings that tell us we deserve more, were meant for more (than this) and that it's our God-given ""right"" to pursue more. We needn't even leave the church to find support for this sort of belief system. It is a far greater challenge, indeed, to embrace contentment with what God has apportioned us, and to do so will always be swimming against the current in today's culture.

I realize it is often difficult to be discerning with so many well-meaning Christian books coming at us, with a thousand different voices about what is right or what is advisable. The Holy Spirit and Gods immutable Word must ultimately lead us in the right direction. It seems to me that the vast majority of women live ordinary lives where they can and should use the gifts God has given them. But how and when they use those gifts is a matter of great discernment that should be made with much prayer, counsel and adherence to Gods Word.",1494288000,88,5438,4.530549898167006
171291,5,0849922372,"I read this book at a time in my life where I was truly struggling to figure out what was next. I knew God had something more for me. But what??

171297,5,0849922372,"Author Jennie Allen has a sweet, southern style of writing that oozes of hospitality, comfort, and loyal friendship. Its refreshing, really, to know there are still people in the world like this. In her book, Restless, she describes a large network of friends who support each other through good times and devastating times.

We each feel restless with our lives. It may come across in different times, different ways, or with different intensities, but it is a common feeling. We were made for more. But what is the more we seek? According to Jennie Allen, we were made to be Christ to others: We are filled with God to pour him into the darkness, pour him into the broken souls who are starving for something.

Following our sense of purposethe why am I herecan be risky. Jennie Allen doesnt want that to hold you back: Risk something. Step out and fail. Be the fool. Build a life that needs our God.

I enjoyed reading this book because it is very personal and the stories really developed the ideas well. At the end of each chapter are suggestions for journaling because that is where you dig in to discover your own purpose. Because I read it on Kindle, I chose to read through it the first time and come back to the journaling exercises, which I think are worth the effort.

I give Jennie Allens Restless five cups of love.

171326,4,0849922372,Jennie must be the luckiest person on earth because all her friends and the people she knows and where she lives and how she grew up sounds just wonderful and just too good to be true.

If you feel like your days are adding up to meaning nothing and you feel stuck/trapped/lost this book helps walk you through an untangling process to find clarity/purpose/and passion in what you are doing.  I have a renewed sense of who I am, what I am here for, and what kind of God I serve.  This book gave me more resource for how to process suffering and trials and maintain super faith all the while.

171407,3,0849922372,"A large group of us just completed this study along with the coordinating DVD lectures. TBH, I'm pretty surprised by the high marks this has gotten. The study is good for new Christians or maybe any that are feeling stagnant in their walk, hence the 3-stars.

Some of the writing is clumsy and some of the directions for the exercises are so confusing and/or strange, there were times when people in our group just left the exercises blank (including myself). The accompanying lectures were more like performances, which may be just how the author teaches best. I, personally, found it difficult to sit through.

That all said, I very much respect how the author is following her calling to serve the Lord in this important way. I'm certain she has touched many lives. Even though I did not enjoy this study, it still made me think hard about God's will and I sought out (mostly from YouTube) other sermons on the topic that were more palatable for me and I learned much from them.",1417564800,8,981,4.632183908045977

I have mad respect for the author and love her vision of stepping out of your comfort zone and jumping into the adventures God has for you. Yet when I first started Restless, I learned that this is a book to dive into when you have the time to really examine and reflect on your life. It is not meant to be a quick read to just knock off the list. So I stepped away and picked it up again a few months later, journal in the other hand. As you read this book, you feel like you are sitting across from Jennie and she is asking you the tough questions. Jennie asks you about various stages in your life (the good and the bad), relationship, and situations that brought you to the place you are today. As you sit and reflect on those things, you begin to see how God has been setting you up to live your life for others and your unique footprint on this world.
I love how she weaves the stories of other world changers in with the ways you can hear what God is saying to you to get off the hamster wheel into a life of great significance. You will walk away from this book encouraged and challenged to not accept the status quo for your life, but to look for how you are wired to be the person God created you to be.",1407110400,,1311,3.988593155893536

171451,4,0849922372,"Restless serves as a sequel to Anything. And it is meant to answer the question: I am all surrendered to God. But now what? To answer this question Jennie Allen has provided a framework within the commandments of Scriptureto create lives reflecting God and his passions This framework is provided through worksheet pages that follow most chapters in the book. The worksheet pages help readers identify five unique threads, which Jennie Allen believes are interwoven in every woman's life,  to discover one's ultimate purpose. The five threads are:
1. Gifts
2. Suffering
3. Places
4. People
5. Passions

As was the case with Anything, Restless has a flow-of-consciousness style with Jennie Allens personal stories and experiences interspersed throughout the book. If you're familiar with her work, then you know these stories are mainly about her close friends and children, including her son adopted from Rwanda. These stories are all inspirational, but sometimes their meaning seems as if it would be clearer if the reader knew her personally. The personal anecdotes are also repetitive of what shes written in previous works.

Overall, however, Restless delivers a solid framework for discovering ones purpose. It does, however, read similarly, at times, to Rick Warrens Purpose Driven Life.",1405555200,3,1293,5.328431372549019

I came away from reading Jennie Allens Restless reprocessing some of my past because I realized God could  and does  use those hard seasons for his glory, even now. This book prompts introspection of where youve been and where you're going, using Josephs life has an encouragement that what could have broken us can still be redeemed.

Jennie Allen energized me to live intentionally  for Gods glory alone. What we say to people, where we send our kids to school, how we prioritize our marriage and other relationships, who we invite over and in, where we go, how we spend our time and our money, and what we teach our kids  all of that matters.

Restless is a book that encourages and challenges on the same page. Its packed with truth I wanted to highlight with my pen and absorb with my heart. There is space to write and process and I know Ill revisit these pages over and over again.",1402444800,,993,4.458563535911602

Have you dreamed of living a life completely released to Christ and running with abandon the path He has planned for you, but aren't sure where to step first?

I, too, have had some of those same feelings.  I just finished reading this amazing book, Restless, by Jennie Allen and it is a transformational read.  In it, she takes the reader from hearing a soft whisper of what life would look life if we pursued God completely with our lives to digging deep and dreaming about what some of those opportunities might be.  She uses the story of Joseph and its many ups and downs as a backdrop to notice parallels of highs and lows we may face in our own experience.  The book includes wonderful prompts for journaling throughout where you can pause and think through your own passions and challenges and dream of ways God may use them for His glory.  She also encourages thoughtful reflection time in prayer and with trusted mentors to begin to put together the pieces that lead to Gods vision for your life.  Filled with stories of inspiring, faithful witnesses, this book led me on a journey where I was encouraged to notice different moments in my life and how they may be leading me in exciting new pathways for the Lord.  The book also brought conviction to my soul about areas I had neglected and lacked in discipline.  Restless inspired me to think about my life in a new way and is already encouraging me to follow Spirit-led promptings.  I would wholeheartedly encourage you to read this book and pursue Gods leading!

171462,5,0849922372,"It's the rare book that takes me two months to read, especially if I like it, but such was the case with Restless by Jennie Allen. Honestly, I'd gladly take six months or a year to read this book, so full is it of reflective questions and topics for deep thinking. Two months has felt like too fast for this book. (Disclaimer: I received a free copy of the book through the BookLook Bloggers program.)

So, what is Restless? In short, it's permission to dream. Whatever stage of life we find ourselves in, Jennie Allen encourages us to consider what we were made for. She takes readers through her own journey of discovering and rediscovering her calling in the midst of motherhood and gives us the opportunity to identify painful and meaningful experiences from our past. It was on those pages that I personally realized I'd always been a writer and that writing will be a constant in my life, no matter the other passions and pursuits I find myself exploring.

Restless is a uniquely personal journey for every reader. Our church's book club has been reading through it, and the few times I've been part of those discussions, I can see that it has different meaning for everyone. (And not just for women in their 20s and 30s. Women of ALL ages can benefit from finding their purpose and passion.)
I love the way the author writes. It's like chatting with a friend across a cafe table with coffee mugs in hand. I half expected her to reach through the pages and offer a hug like she said she wanted to do. Her words are authentic, real and challenging.

Toward the end of the book, she offers a letter from her husband to husbands about helping the women in their lives find their purpose and follow it. It was touching, and while I might hand it over to my husband to have him read it, I'm grateful that he is already on board with my passions.

So, if you pick this one up, don't rush through it. Get a notebook and fill it with words and scribbles. Grab a friend and read it together and look over your threads, as Allen calls them, and dream together.

I think that's what I love best about the book: its emphatic message that it's okay to dream. Too often I think we, women, give up our dreams for our families or our families become our dreams. Sometimes that's okay or it's okay for a season, but for me, I know that discovering my passions and following them is a source of great fulfillment that carries over into my family. When I am doing what God made me to do, I'm a better wife and mom.

Restless confirms and encourages that, for any stage, any calling. It doesn't discount the call to motherhood or serving families. It releases us to be whatever God made us to be.

And that, friends, is freeing.",1401235200,6,2714,4.426853707414829

I've read many books on ""callings"" and finding your purpose, this one goes a step further with these thought provoking exercises. Besides all that -- it gave me an ""aha"" personal revelation that blew me away. Like an answer hiding in plain sight right before me, my own ""threads"" of life experience were weaving quite a tapestry. I highly recommend this book.

In her book Restless: Because You Were Made For More, Jennie Allen challenges the reader to take a closer look at the threads of their life, and through doing so find their God-given purpose. The people, places, passions, sufferings, and gifts in our lives all work together as part of God's plan for our lives.

We have a tendency to focus way more on ourselves than we do on God. The result is either focusing on making a name for ourselves or living a false humility and not using our talents, gifts, and experiences as God intended.

By taking the time to examine the various threads in our lives, we can better understand how to live our lives for God so we can get over ourselves and get on with the work God intended us to do.

As Jennie walks your through the process of untangling these threads, she shares the story of Joseph and shows how the people, places, passions, suffering, and gifts all fit in to the greater story of God and how ours do too.

I enjoyed the process of reading and working through this book. Jennie is clearly passionate about helping others find their God-given purpose. I liked the journal pages that are included to assist you as your untangle and examine the various threads in your life.

Working through this book affirmed that in many ways I am living my purpose. However, it also showed me that there are areas where I let fear reign. It's time to get over myself, surrender the fear, and allow God to be the builder of my dreams.

Whether you find yourself searching for your God-given purpose or just need some encouragement as your live out your purpose, I think you'll find this book to be a great resource.

171475,4,0849922372,"I quoted from the book Restless by Jennie Allen in my last blog post. This little book had been sitting in my to read pile for several weeks, and when I finally read it, I found that the message went right along with what my heart had been longing for lately. Isnt it amazing how God knows what you need and puts things in your life just at the right time? He has been doing that with the books Ive been reading lately, and its been so encouraging!

This book wasn't anything new, per se, but it was a fresh reminder that we are each created with a specific purpose, and when we live according to that purpose, we can have that fulfilling and God-honoring life that we are restless for. While Jennies writing style is a little different, a little more casual, than the ones I tend to gravitate and relate more to, it is a down to earth, practical book that is unhindered by weighty theology or deep introspect. Jennie used the story of Joseph from the book Genesis in the Bible as an example of how all the ups and downs in our lives, our unique gifts, talents, and passions, and where God has placed us all come together in defining His specific purpose for our lives. She gives thought-provoking questions for those struggling with determining what exactly they should be doing with their lives, and encouragement for the restless, those who feel like they don't know what Gods purpose is exactly, specifically for them.

While I am confident in where God has placed me and what His purpose is for my life for right now, it was what my soul needed to remember to use everything He has given me for that purpose. Its like I was trying to say in my last post about how I feel like Im still finding myself instead of having it all together, like I thought I would by now. Im not having a mid-life crisis or feeling lost without knowing Gods will for mebut I struggle with knowing how exactly to live out that purpose at times. Restless gave me relief knowing that I was normal, and encouragement to keep in mind that God has a specific purpose for my life and that He has given me my gifts, passions, and desires for a reason: to use them all, right now, right here, for Him.

If you're struggling with knowing what Gods purpose is for you, you may want to pick up this book. It has some great questions for you to answer to see the passions and patterns in your life that God can use for His glory.

Do you feel like there is more to life than what you are experiencing right now? Do you feel like you were made for more? Do you feel restless?

Jennie Allen did, and suspects that many others feel the same way. Using the story of Joseph from Genesis, Jennie shows us how our personal story can fit into God's greater story.

Jennie Allen is an incredible author with a real pulse on the questions and longings of our generation. This is my second book of her's to read and each time I find myself asking, ""How does she know exactly what I am thinking?"" Allen is very relatable and authentic and that translates into a book that will draw you in and help you to realize your God-given dreams and talents and how to use them for His glory.

She asks her readers, ""What would happen if God got bigger than your fear and insecurity, and you spent the rest of your life running without reservation after his purposes for you?"" Get ready for an interactive read full of contemplation, journaling, and dreaming. Each chapter has space for writing and reflecting on what you have learned.

Restless has been very influential in my life. It has helped me to realize that God has put dreams and passions in my life for a reason. I loved being able to journal and process what all was discussed.

171483,4,0849922372,"Overall, I liked this book. I appreciated the process that Allen uses in discernment and spiritual direction. However, by writing it just to women, Allen confines her work and her excellent ideas to one gender, and this is really unfortunate. I would (and do) recommend this book to people I counsel, but I give men that caveat that most of the examples are women.

The best part about this book is that even though Allen has a ""formula"" for discernment, (Gods story + my threads + the need + the Holy Spirit = my purpose p 66), she does not promote it in a rigid way. The Holy Spirit has plenty of room to work, re-direct, and re-shape in the prayerful discernment process. She also puts the process of discernment in community, which gives an organic feel to the process.

Allen writes from her conservative Christian perspective. If you are not of a similar mindset, you may find some of her statements hard to apply.

Overall, there's lots of good stuff in her book. Her style is easily to access and assimilate.

From worrying about being prideful about my gift, to my concern over how being in ministry will affect my role as wife and mother, God uses Jennie to knock over every single excuse about not whole heartedly running the race for Him. I read this on the kindle app on my phone, but purchased a hard copy just so I could pass it on to my friends. I keep taking about it to everyone I meet. A few days into reading this book, after reaffirming my gifting, acknowledging God's calling in my life, and recognizing the need around me that I felt a passion about meeting, I received a phone call asking me to serve in a position that exactly met all of those criteria.

Jennie Allen encourages and inspires you to find that purpose and pursue it.  If you're not sure what that is, Restless even provides ""worksheets"" to help you determine the gifts God has given you.

I am glad I read Restless and would definitely encourage others to read it - especially other ladies in the same season of life as myself.  I enjoyed Jennie's style of writing and could easily relate to her life as a wife and mom to young children.  Although the worksheets weren't something I would typically do, I think other readers would appreciate how the activities can help them figure out their gifts and calling.  The book did inspire and encourage me to continue to pursue what I feel God is calling me to do during this season of my life.  One of my favorite themes of the book was how Jennie Allen challenges us to act now rather than wait for a more convenient season of life.  I also like that Jennie recommended reading certain portions of the Bible and shared other scripture regularly throughout the book.

Several of the bloggers I follow either know her and have read her books, have participated in her studies, or have just read her books and recommended them. When I saw that her newest book, Restless, was up for review, I had to check it out. I must say, I loved it!

In this book, Jennie uses testimonies and situations from her own life as well as from the lives of those women closest to her to help the reader to find ""threads"" in her life and figure out how to use those threads all together to the Glory of God. It's really quite fascinating.

Jennie is well-written and I had no trouble following her reading at all. I loved her constant reference to scripture and her ability to be down to earth while helping the reader to dig deep in their lives to find their purpose.

I also loved that within the pages of the book were journal pages that were designed to be written upon after each chapter was finished to help identify the mentioned threads. I didn't write in mine because I wanted to send the book to a friend after I read it and I want her to be able to write in it.

Jennie writes to help the reader, typically women, to listen to God right where they are. Whether it is as a mother, wife, employee, etc, she really tries to point women to find what they are passionate about in everyday life and use that to glorify God. I loved that she brought this to the forefront because I think so often, we feel like we have to do more, add something to our ""list"" in order to honor God. Jennie really drives home the point that this simply isn't the case.

I would recommend this book to anyone and I can't wait to send it to my friend!",1396224000,,1697,4.193251533742331
171490,5,0849922372,"Do you have the feeling you are missing something?  Are you longing for more out of life, or do you have dreams that are yearning to be fulfilled?  Joseph had a dream.  When his immaturity go the best of him, it set off a string of events that led to both suffering and blessing.  His suffering produced the very thing he had dreamed about.

""Restless"" takes the story of Joseph and shows how everything he suffered and all of his gifts and relationships were the threads that fit into God's greater story.  What would happen if we believed this was the way God worked in our lives?  Jennie Allen gives us permission to hold on to our dreams and encourages us to dream our dreams and follow through with what God is showing us through them.
Allen is encouraging and uplifting.  She is passionate about her calling and wants others to be passionate about theirs.  I recently had the privilege of reviewing her Bible study, ""Restless"", which condenses the book down to its basic premise, and the book is a wonderful companion to the study as it expounds on her message of living our God-given dreams.

171493,5,0849922372,"I can tell a book is going to be really good when I've highlighted nearly the entire introductory chapter. If you follow me on Instagram, you also know that I was one of those annoying people who occasionally posted pictures of highlighted portions of this book as I was reading it. But really, I couldn't help myself. This book is too good not share with everyone I know.

I've never read a book or Bible study by Jennie Allen before; she was a new name to me. I quickly felt like she was a dear friend who cared deeply about helping me couple my passions with God's plan. In the beginning, Jennie writes about a call to dream. She puts forth the idea that everything in our lives- even the most seemingly boring element (like our location, vocation or situation) of our lives could be part of a greater purpose. She writes, ""This is a book about God. And this is a book about us and God. And this is a book about the moment we close our eyes and see God. This is a book about facing the God of the universe and answering to him about the life and resources he gives us while we are here.... This is a book about changing the world and changing diapers."" (pg. 5)

That last line caught me off guard... changing the world and changing diapers. While this book is not solely about motherhood (its applicable to all seasons of life, young and old), it has helped me to see that even though much of my time is spent caring for my littles, that is no excuse to check out from my calling to be a Kingdom Worker. In this most recent season of motherhood, I've struggled to find a purpose outside my family. Not that I think there has to be a purpose outside my family-- that is the most important ministry my husband and I have-- but as Jennie describes so beautifully throughout this book, there is a restlessness in my heart for more.

Restless is broken down into 3 parts: The Call, The Threads and Living on Purpose. Loosely examining the life of Joseph, Jennie takes each reader on a person journey of self-discovery and gives simple, concise steps on how to apply that awareness to a Heavenly use. I say she loosely examines the life of Joseph because I was honestly expecting a bit more exegesis on the life of Joseph. Joseph is one of the stories of the Bible that has facilitated the most profound breakthroughs in my personal life, so I was hoping for a bit more depth in this area, but it was all still solid teaching- even if it didn't go quite as deep as I'd hoped it would.

Each section has in-depth journal prompts that help to weave together the people and places of your life in hopes of finding a clearer path to your purpose. I read and journaled through this book on my own, but think it would be highly beneficial done as a group (which is strongly encouraged by Jennie). She also weaves stories of her own friends, and their journeys of discovery as they worked through this Restless Project. She writes, ""What if the darkest moments of your life god intended for good: And what if the purest moments of bliss contained your greatest contributions to this world? God speaks through story because that is how we best understand the most important things."" (pg 91)  Whether you are restless and searching for purpose in your life, or you have a clear idea of what God has called you to, this book is a great tool that would benefit any Christian. It is one of the most personally challenging books I have read lately, with a call to action that can't easily be overlooked or breezed through. Get your highlighter ready and read Restless Because You Were Made for More!

171496,5,0849922372,"Part book, part workbook, Restless by Jennie Allen is an excellent book to help one find the threads of their life and weave them together to fulfill Gods calling or dream placed on each persons life.

After the first 57ish pages, each chapter is short and succinct, moving the reader into a time to jot down their passions, their hurts, their gifts, influential people, and places and weave what may seem like useless threads of their life and create a fabric designed specifically and especially by God.

I enjoyed this book immensely. Jennie Allen has a way of cutting right to the chase and getting to the heart of an issue. She leaves no stone unturned as she leads readers on their own journey of recognizing we need no longer be restless when we are followers of God.

As the book states, Untangling the threads of our lives and assembling them together in one place reveals a beautiful plan designed by the Creator himself: Gods Agenda + my threads + the need + the Holy Spirit = my purpose.

Jennies passion exudes from the pages of the book and the information that the reader ought to recall and weave together is exactly what this generation needs to get back on track with Gods will and dreams for our lives!

171499,3,0849922372,"The book Restless (by Jennie Allen) is a book written for those who want to be more of who God made them to be and who are willing to allow their past to propel them into their future. It is not just a book you read; it's a study you take part in. With easily readable chapters that aren't too lengthy (which is key for most busy women I know), Restless is a book that can draw the reader closer to the heart of the Lord.

There are a lot of things that I really love about this book. Jennie Allen's open and honest writing is refreshing and her desire to see women grow closer to their Lord through open honesty and small groups are something the modern-day church could use a lot more of. And in every chapter I found at least one ""take away"" ~ some nugget of truth that impacted the way I view my life and my ability to glorify God in all of it's ups and downs.

There are also things that I did not love about this book. I'm a type-A lady through and through. I don't do well with time lines and vague instructions, and the last portion of Restless has a lot of that. Now I also realize that I'm 41, of a different generation than the author's primary audience. That has a lot to do with the things I did not love about Restless. Jennie Allen is a great writer, and I can see from this book that she has a wonderful ministry. I'm probably just too old and too type-A to be able to grab hold of all she has to offer.  I encourage you to read several reviews and see what others have to say rather than taking this one paragraph from one book review and decide not to read the book. My opinion is just that - and I'm willing to admit I may be the odd man out here :)

If you do read the book and have something to share with me about it, I'd love to read your comments. Especially if they aren't in agreement with my opinion ~ that's one way I ""grow up"", so to speak.

Thanks for reading my review of Restless, and Lord bless you today!

The very core of this book will help the reader realize that we are all called to a purpose and that yes, there is more!

I thought Jennie Allen was a very encouraging writer.  Her words remind us to take a backseat and to realize that life is not always all about us or our agenda. Jennie's writing comes across as authentic, she shares personal experiences as well as biblical scripture.

Restless discusses the ""threads"" of life and I love that there were pages for journaling to help us ponder and discover our own ""threads.""

This book will help you discover your own ""unique part of God's story.""  It can be read by anyone but would definitely be a great choice for a Bible study.

Restless: Because You Were Made for More by Jennie Allen, 2013 ~ published by Thomas Nelson

Oh! You are going to love God's tapestry. What looks like a mishmash of threads on the back looks like a super adventure on the front! Wait until the final picture is revealed ~ then you will know why all the color is in one spot. You are the depth of color! [I would guess mine will be p-u-r-p-l-e among beautiful hues ~ those He has given me.]

  You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in You.
  --Saint Augustine

We each long to be at home with God ~ His sweet presence ~ His singing over us! How He delights in us. Psalm 139 is so, so special to our hearts. Here is a beautiful beginning quote from Jennie on page 4:

  I want to dream of what our purposes may be.
  The conviction to write this book was born out of conversations with many of you. Since I wrote the first book, Anything, the most consistent thing I have been asked is some version of this question:
  ""I am in. I am all surrendered to God. But now what? I don't know what he wants me to do.""
  Every single one of us is designed to fit into a unique space with unique offerings. God's will for every one of us will look different. There is a framework within the commandments of Scripture, and within it we are free to create lives reflecting God and his passions here.

Restless ~ Using the story of Joseph, the dreamer, Jennie explains how his suffering, gifts, relationships--all of the threads of his life--fit into the greater story of God and how our stories can do the same (Genesis 37-50). What would happen if God got bigger than your fear and insecurity, and you spent the rest of your life running without reservation after his purposes for you? You were created for more.
Part 1 is The Call; Part 2: The Threads; and Part 3: Living on Purpose.

Also available is an 8-week Restless Bible study. The studies are preceded with a short video overview before each lesson.

*Quick disclaimer - after taking notes in the margins, highlighting quotes, and tabbing pages in the first 4-5 chapters, it became clear to me that there would be no way I'd get my review done in a timely manner so I started just reading the content. I plan to go back and start from the beginning again so I can go through the journaling and tasks that Allen lines out for her readers - I think that will make the book even better for me!

Ah, restless. I've been restless for what seems like my entire life - always wondering what I should really be doing and if all of the things I was already doing were coming from my own agenda, or if I was following God's plan for my life. Struggle after struggle - this has got to be my largest and my most intense one. When I saw this book on the ""Available For Review"" page, I'm pretty sure I jumped out of my chair in excitement.

Well, Jennie Allen didn't disappoint and she did so much for me in this book. I think Restless: Because You Were Made for More will do something for everyone who reads it.

Allen used personal experiences as well as several stories from other women and families to show readers that having purpose doesn't just come from the ""big"" things like travelling to Africa or leading a church or running some lucratively successful start-up business. Instead it comes from all the pieces and stories of our lives. It is there in the pouring of cereal for the 4-year-old, it is there in the smiling greeting provided to each customer that comes in the door, it is there even in pain and struggle.

This book can be read by anyone, but Allen does focus much of her attention on women - calling them to dream, to find their worth in all the moments of their lives, and encouraging them to dream outside the box - don't feel boxed in by societal norms or what they think equals purpose in a ""standard"" world. She makes it clear that we're all as different as can be and those differences offer exactly what God wants offered and exactly when and where He would have it offered. Additionally, there is a small section written by her husband (geared towards other men who are blessed to be able to support the women in their lives). In his section, Allen's husband talks of a time when he wasn't supportive of his wife's dreams and the conversion he had to make both within himself and with Allen to resolve those issues and feelings.

As you'll see above, I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. Around the middle, the book becomes very evangelical in the sense that all the scenarios and examples and other content seemed to lead readers to the assumption that the only way to have purpose is to lead some church group or other spiritually based and guided group, class, etc. This part lost me because that isn't my nature. I am more of the type that wants to find a purpose, make a difference in lives, and let the Godly part shine through that. I'm not very evangelical so I started to get disappointed that maybe this book wasn't as wide-thinking as I thought. However, that line of content didn't last and Allen again brought things around to the point that everyone has purpose, those purposes all look very different and sound very different, even feel very different, but if we're partnering with God, they are all for His plan even if we're not sitting in front of people talking about God and converting them on the spot. That is the only reason I rated down one star.

If you're still waffling on your purpose, feel like you might need a new purpose, or just want to reaffirm the one(s) you're currently pursuing, give this book a try. It is uplifting, reassuring, and quite moving. Readers will get a new feel for the minutiae of their days, and also a new vigor for dreaming and following those dreams even if they seem way too large for the here and now.

I was provided with an ARC of this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own. I am not compensated for any of my reviews.",1394582400,,4101,4.406869220607661
171506,5,0849922372,"So I just finished this book. And it wrecked my heart in the most powerful, beautiful, messy way. Really laid me bare in my heart in perfect timing. I have been really struggling because I had so many ideas and I wasn't sure which direction to go. Needless to say, I was Restless. But then this beautifully designed book arrived at my doorstep on Friday afternoon, right around the time I had finished my deadlines for the week. I picked up its matte cover, which felt so nice in my hands, and read a few words. These words, on the very first page after the title page, the Dedication page:

""You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in You."" ~Saint Augustine
God, You are home to me. Take these words and light fires that cannot be put out-for Your fame on this earth in our time.
I mean, those words spoke to something so deep in my heart at a time of searching. They captivated me, and I kept reading. I read and dreamed and scribbled and bookmarked and made many many pink notes in this book and my nootebook. God freed something in my soul through this book.

Jennie's premise is: God's story + our threads (the gifts God has given us, what makes our heart sing, and what we've struggled with) + the need + The Holy Spirit = My Purpose.

As I nervously investigated the threads of my life, and humbly held out hands and memories before God, I found the most beautiful thing. I found my purpose.

 Jennie really leads you through a God-focused, Holy-Spirit-driven plan of action to help you uncover your purpose for God's glory.  I shed a lot of tears and I laughed out loud more than once. I'm pretty sure Jennie and I would be great friends.

My own purpose and dreams will take some time. But the sharing of this book? That can start right now. Jennie Allen has created something brilliantly inspired here, so touching and warm, so personal and yet downright big. Big enough to change the world. So grab this book, my dear friends, get your pink (or purple or blue or red) pen and let's get our hearts and lives a bit messy for God's glory.

171509,5,0849922372,"Normally I wouldn't pick this book up because I heard it was a lot about living a God-driven-dream-chasing-life, and amongst many of the things I'm not good at, dreaming ranks pretty high on the score card. Also, how many books can one person read on living a God glorifying purpose and plan? Don't they all just sound a little redundant after a while?

Yes. Except this one. (Or maybe I've been needing a wake-up call that was put so beautifully and in an in-your-face kind of way.)

I haven't hit my mid-twenties yet and already life has become so mundane. See I sorta bought into the idea that my twenties were going to be this time of adventure and care-free living, but I must've missed that boat when it set sail. Life happened, and I mistakenly put dreaming on a shelf, thinking that's what responsible, practical minded adults do. (Yes, it's true, I can sometime error too much on the side of practicality to a fault, and drag down others with me.) Perhaps more grievously, thinking that's what God would want me to do. I thought dreaming was selfish to do. But after reading Restless, I'm seeing how wrong I am.

Turns out, I need to start dreaming again, and let those very dreams fill my sail.

Young or old, if life has got you in a rut, or if in any shape or way it seems mundane and so routine, you need to pick up a copy of Allen's new book. Life is NOT mundane, and there is nothing boring or routine about our lives. God has set before us a race to run, a story to live out; each and every single person has their personal one, no two will ever be alike. My race, my story is my own to run and live out, and yours is your own too. We may come alongside each other, but God has set before each one of his children a different paths and different ways to glorify Him. Below is the first episode of the companion video study, if you need more encouragement to get a copy.

A few days earlier I had tearfully cried out to the Lord, ""something is wrong with me, I feel so restless."" This book was His answer to that sad little prayer.  I have struggled for quite some time about whether or not I was entitled to dream the dreams that filled my head and heart. I have sat contently in a ministry where I knew my gifts were being used afraid to raise my hand and admit I had more to offer. I have been in chains to this ministry that had essentially put me in a box and I felt it was ""inappropriate"" to ask to be let out. God has ignited a passion in my heart and he has compelled me to follow my heart. This book confirmed I was on the right path and was truly a cool cup of water that has quenched the doubts and insecurities that plague me. They still rear their head, but now I can turn from them and turn towards the path God wants me to take. I cannot wait to see what he does. If you feel any of these things, read this book.

Jennie encourages women to dream, to surrender, to love God, and to passionately pursue him and his desire for our lives.  She also deals with the things that sometimes keep us from dreaming.

Throughout the book there are journaling pages and questions to help you identify your unique threads, and help you dream about the ways God may want to use you in his kingdom.  I found these helpful to identify gifts, callings, and passions in my life that point towards a unique and God designed purpose.

I really enjoyed this book.  I love Jennie's passionate and authentic style of writing.  She gets to the heart of issues.  For myself, I found it will take more processing to clearly define my gifts and passions, but it is a very helpful book to start that process of finding meaning, fulfillment, and purpose.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to dream and search for more of God in the daily grind of life.

One of my favorite quotes from the book is from Daniel Radcliffe being interviewed on Larry King about the role of Harry Potter. He said, I always knew that anyone who was given this role would have the same fame. It was never about me. It was about this franchise. I was simply a part of something bigger. Wow! What if we as women of Christ could act this way as part of something bigger instead of hurting each other and comparing our big dreams to others? Great read!",1393545600,,580,4.429906542056075

I know this because there are several places in the book to journal and dig deem and chew on the words inside this book and your own thoughts from reading this book. I haven't done that yet because I wanted to get this review done. Chewing on this book is going to take me some time and more time than I feel like I owed book sneeze to do a review in exchange for the book.

My thoughts to you are RUN and get this book or just click over here and order it to arrive on your door step. Trust me you will thank me later.

This book taunted me when I logged into Book Sneeze and tried to pick a book to take with me on a cruise so I had reading material. The title just took me in. Because I am restless right now. I have this stirring inside of me that I can't put my thumb on. God is doing something in me and with me but it's not something I can just put a lot of words to.

This  book has spoken to me on so many levels. If you follow me on twitter you have seen so many quotes pasted as I have devoured this book. I seriously couldn't put it down. She could have written the book just for me. But, I believe that you too, will get something out of it because we were all made for more.

There are desires and passions inside each of us. There are stirrings in us that need to be birthed. There are things that have happened to us that are fueling these passions and dreams. Wherever you are in your journey - Restless or not, I believe that we all have this desire for more.

Jennie will help you map out these passions, dreams and this desire for more in life. This book walks you through dreaming and helps you find fuel for the stirrings inside. Just trust me and read this book. You won't be sorry you did.

I love her style of writing. I could picture her sitting across from me in a coffee shop, except I don't drink coffee but whatever, I could picture a conversation as I read this book. Someone cheering for me as I dream the dreams that God is putting inside of me. Someone spurring me to begin to dream again, to pursue the God stirring inside of me. And you will to. You will feel her pushing you to map it out and do the work to find out what drives you, what fuels you, what makes your heart beat just a little faster and then RUN after it with everything in you. ""Run your Guts out"" as she says often in the book. Just do something .... Because you and I, were made for more!",1393459200,,2495,3.94831013916501
171516,5,0849922372,"Restless: Because You Were Made for More by Jennie Allen is a book about finding and living out Gods will and purpose for our lives. As you read through Allens words, you will find that rather than treating Gods will as something nebulous, she urges us to examine our experiences, gifts and passions for the unique ways we are created and gifted as evidence of our purpose.

In Restless, Allen urges us all to give ourselves permission to dream, to not simply push aside the feeling that we were made for more, but to press into it and ask what if. She asserts that rather than assuming ministry and mission work happen only in churches or faraway lands, we should see every place in our world as worthy of purpose and needing Gods light. She gives permission for your purpose to be as grand as reaching a whole generation or as small as reaching those in your office building or home.

Allen asserts that no part of ourselves or our life experience is wasted. You will examine your gifts, the places you live and work, the people in your life, your passions and your life experiences  joys as well as struggles  and see them all as part of the tapestry of your purpose God is weaving together. As you read through the chapters on these areas, you will appreciate the journaling pages which give you space to examine and explore the concepts, along with insightful questions to direct your thoughts.

171518,4,0849922372,"Restless: Because You Were Made for More by Jennie Allen is a fun push to believe that God made you with specific gifts and talents you should embrace and grow, rather than shrink away from. The book is a mix of personal sharing by the author, suggested exercises, and vision casting for the larger things you life might be about. I was a bit skeptical at first, as I'm not sure we women need another vague exhortation to ""become your best you!"" But this book is much more than that, primarily because Jennie Allen is such a fun writer. In several places I found myself wishing she'd continue the through-line of different stories she shared (really, I want her to write a memoir!)  But her larger point is a good one, too, especially where she challenges readers not to shrink back from our gifts and talents just because it can feel awkward to stretch ourselves in this way (or because other people don't always like it when we stretch!)
Here's one of my favorite passages, from page 104:

""What are you just flat-out great at? I mean, don't go all spiritual on me. Are you a great storyteller, or are you funny, or are you a musician or great at math or problem solving or listening or running? Or are you good with your hands, like all Pinterest crafty? I don't like you if you are that good at that kind of stuff, but I get that you can't help it. My sister and my mom are brilliant party hosts and chefs and homemakers and designers. I fight jealousy and inadequacy as I stir powdered pink lemonade in a plastic yellow pitcher for my kind of hostessing, but whatever.

For just a moment, compare yourself to no one else and lay down every picture of what you think it looks like to be gifted for God. Think about what you love and what you are great at. If you are a believer in Jesus, this may be how God's Spirit has gifted you to build up his church.""

Good stuff, no? And I'll confess, when I read it the first time I thought, ""Waitwhat's wrong with powdered pink lemonade?"" Might be why I like it :)

I think it will appeal to all ages no matter what stage of life you are in, and especially if you are transitioning from one stage to the next, and wondering what God has for you next.

Restless by Jennie Allen
by Amy Fleeker  February 17, 2014

Restless by Jennie Allen
Restless by Jennie Allen is a great book to help you come to terms with your purpose and dreams in life. In this book she uses threads as a way to describe the weaving in and out of your life and how it can be intertwined with Gods Purpose for you. She also uses stories from her own life and the story of Joseph in the Bible.  I love the way it seems she is talking right in front of you as you are reading. Your own personal coach in a book.

One thing that hit home with me was when she talked about using your gifts. I always feel like I need to be humble and let someone else take the glory. Or I am the one seeing the worst time of my life meaningless, not how it can be used for good. Why not face our fears and go after those passions and dreams God created for us. We need to be the person God intended us to be and use those gifts",1392595200,,939,3.9263157894736844
171524,5,0849922372,"The very same day that I picked up a copy of Jennie Allens Anything on the bargain rack at my local Christian bookstore, I had the opportunity to review her new book Restless. And while I have not yet read Anything, I found myself unable to put down Restless.

A book about dreams, calling, purpose, and bringing Glory to God, Restless touched my soul and gave me wings.

Through sharing her own personal life experiences, the stories of some of the people closest to her, and the Biblical account of the life of Joseph, Jennie encourages readers to take off the masks, face their fears, and embrace who God created us to be.

Using the analogy of threads, Restless helps you through the journey of identifying  your own gifts and passions, and how the darkest, most painful moments of our lives are often the moments God uses to shape us most.

There is no randomness in the Christian life. God works everything to the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28), always. Even when it hurts, even when we cant understand why, God is there, creating something beautiful, for our good, and His Glory.

Overall, I found Restless to be a Biblically-sound and enriching book, that encouraged me to run whole-heartedly after God. I would give the book an A.

171527,4,0849922372,"""Restless DVD"" is an 8-session group Bible study that Jennie Allen leads on video.  It focuses a lot on helping the participants and viewers of the DVD to discover what their purposes and passions are while helping them to dig deeper into their lives. Sessions include: Restless, Gods Story, Gifts, Suffering, Place, People, Passions, and Mystery. Jennie gives an example in her life of when she was restless and she didn't know exactly why. She uses many examples about the life of Joseph in Scripture and how we can compare what we are going through or will go through in life with what he experienced; she uses other Scriptures outside of Josephs story also. Many past examples in her life are also given to get the points of the 8 sessions across.

I like Jennies teaching style and how she brings Scripture into the lives of the women she teaches. She seems to have a way of applying ancient Scriptures to modern life that makes people smile, laugh, and feel more encouraged, based on the way the women she was teaching spoke and looked in the video, and how I felt. I immediately was drawn into the teaching about running my own race that God has set out for me and that I need to find help when I find myself stuck on the sidelines during my race. It also got me to thinking about the physical places I go to, such as whether I need to make any changes or not, or if I think my role is just not important enough and should stay at those places.

One thing that bothered me in the video was the discouragement of being a rule-keeper in session 2, like when some people in the Bible tried to keep the rules. It made me think that this part of the teaching discourages people to put Moses law (or anybody else God used to show us his law) into practice in their lives if God writes that on their hearts. She might have been thinking of one specific case of someone trying to follow the rules in the Bible and wasn't able to. I know of both Jewish and non-Jewish people who have accepted Messiah that love for God to write Torah from his law on their hearts and who try to put the laws into practice, and often do.

I love hearing about Josephs story in the Bible and I am glad that some of the verses of his story were highlighted. Potential customers of this DVD product need to know that only portions of Josephs story are highlighted though; the whole story is not explained in detail, which is probably good for people that don't want to dig real deep into his story but just might want to know some of the highlights.

I reviewed Restless DVD without its book companion in this review because I was sent the DVD only. Upon browsing through the Restless book here on Amazon I noticed that Jennie talks about a lot of the same things in the book and the DVD. So, this DVD might be a supplement to the book and/or the book might be a supplement to the DVD.

171529,5,0849922372,"After reading (and loving) Jennie's first book, Anything, I couldn't wait to start Restless. It does not disappoint. The first half of the book encourages women to dream of what Jesus might do with their lives, to throw off the sin that hinders, to run the race to bring glory to God. It is a call to women to get over ourselves, quit fearing other people, and to change our focus to whether we are pleasing God. The second part of the book is very interactive and it allows women to dig in and work with God in reflection on your own life and the Word. Through reading and journaling, you identify the ""threads"" of your life - the things that make up the who, what, when and where of your life - acknowledging that all of those threads are not accidents but are in the overarching plan of a Sovereign God. Jennie helps women see that we were each created to have a unique part of God's story - God's story of redeeming a broken world that is desperately in need of Him. And, she does a fabulous job of helping us to acknowledge why we might be afraid or pull back from dreaming of being a part of that story.

171534,5,0849922372,"I was blessed to have discovered the work of Jennie Allen about two years ago, and since then she has literally rocked my world. Her words have met me right where I am as a Christian wife and mom, and God has used her immensely to help me become who I am today. Her most recent book, Restless, has struck a note in my heart and it's evident by the many notes and underlines that are now in my copy of the book.

Restless is a book that I will definitely have to go through again and really dig deep. In the last few years I have been unsure about what God wants from me. I know I am a wife and mom, but somehow I thought there should be more, and I was, as the title of the book implies, restless. But through reading this book I have been incredibly reminded that I need to submit (it's not a bad thing!) and realize that I am doing exactly what I should be! Joesph is one of my favorite Bible characters and through Restless, Allen follows his story and teaches us that God uses our threads, His agenda, needs and the Holy Spirit to create purpose. We just need to stop being restless and listen to Him when He speaks through the threads. A beautifully written, well organized book that would be perfect for Women's Small Group studies and individual study alike.

I highly recommend this book and give it a huge thumbs up!",1392163200,,1325,4.21259842519685
171535,3,0849922372,"I had the opportunity to preview the video sessions for Jennie Allen's new Bible Study, Restless. This DVD consists of 8 video sessions which are each about 20 minutes in length.  Jennie teaches about how God weaves His story through our lives. Each of us is a unique creation of God, and He desires for us to find our purpose, even if right now it's just in the mundane. After we discover what he has for us, we need to run with all we have to accomplish His purposes.

The Bible Study is based on the life of Joseph. The video sessions mention Joseph occasionally, but he is not the focus of the teaching portion.  I think I was at a disadvantage not having the book or study guide to do along side the DVD. Maybe it would have tied things together better.

Jennie Allen is passionate about what she teaches. She is speaking in front of a small group of women in each session which makes it more personal. The videos were shot in a contemporary style. Each one starts with a couple of women trying to answer a random question about themselves. They begin to answer and it cuts to another woman who also begins to answer it. Overall, I felt the topics were good and the videos were well done, but at times the delivery seemed a little dramatic, but hey, I'm on the ""older side"" now!

The subtitle of Restless is: ""Because You Were Made for More.""  Through this Bible Study, Jennie wants you to understand that we need to look for the ""threads"" of our life to see how God is weaving them together. Then we can discover what we are meant to do. We were made for more than a lot of us are settling for.

I believe younger women will relate to the study and enjoy it's contemporary feel and style. I think the material is useful, but not necessarily deep, though my opinion of that might change if I did it along side the workbook.

I thought the study was good, but I was hoping to like the videos more.

171536,4,0849922372,"This review is for the DVD first and then the book.  It is a quality production DVD---well staged, lit, and recorded.  The price for the entire kit is reasonable and includes the DVD, study guide, leaders guide, and a discussion card set according to the information on a retail site.

Allen is a vibrant and intense leader who seems genuinely passionate about what she is teaching.  This is a study with more practical application than many I have viewed.  A call to step up into a more committed and satisfying live.  Her illustrations and examples fit wonderfully with real life in today's world, and they are not as gender specific as some studies which means that a guy could watch this and not feel left out.

The last session seemed the weakest of those presented, but does close the study.  The success or failure of this study rests more with the participant than the presenter, I think.  So if you are ready to give that restless ache up, this might be a good place to begin.

I do recommend this study based on what I saw in the DVD.  And since this DVD did not come with a study guide, I may order one just to see if it is useful to accomplishing the goal of this study and then bring to some folks I know.

This DVD was provided to me by the publisher in return for this review.

The book is the companion to the DVD by the same name I reviewed earlier.  In this Allen expands her discussion of finding the place and dream that is unique to each individual--the place where all the pieces fit together as it becomes a place of satisfaction.

After the introduction, the work begins in earnest.  If this program is followed the reader should gain some insight into a fuller life.  She points out early that the results are not guaranteed.  After reading through this I would say that the results depend on some honest work from the individual.  Fear to look into some of the questions will short circuit the process.  Yes, tissues will probably be needed.

Each step is discussed, illustrated and then the reader is encouraged to work through some probing questions, the hard stuff we generally shove to the back.  The intent is to find a pattern, not to wallow in maudlin self-examination.  Allen reminds the reader that this study is meant for a short time of examination and then use the results to move forward.  The study is not designed for a solo flight.  Support during the process seems essential and necessary to obtain the most clear and accurate picture possible.

So, for those that are restless and sensing it is time to do something about that, this is one study may be just what you need.  Check it out and decide.

171537,5,0849922372,"Jennie Allen knocks it out of the park with yet another witty, honest, challenging book/bible study.  As a follow up to the book Anything where Allen challenges her reader to surrender, this book attempts to help the reader answer the question ""now what happens that I've surrendered?""

What I love most about this book is the way each chapter allows the reader to more forward, processing their personal journey of why God has placed them on the path they are on.  Allen allows the reader to celebrate the things that bring them joy, and helps us all realize God finds joy in our talents.  Additionally the reader it brought through the story of Joseph and Allen has this simple way of writing which allows the story of Joseph to parallel our own, and yet our story is kept uniquely our own.

If you are wondering what your purpose on earth is, why you are living where you are or have to deal with the people you do, this book is for you.  If you are in need of affirmation that your mission field IS where you are called, this book is for you.

Each sections has chapters that are great about looking at each of these parts to help build the big picture.

A favorite quote from the book for me is: ""There is a time and a place to search for our unique parts in God's story...but...here is my admonition: Respond to the need you see. Right now."" (p35)

When I was browsing the BookSneeze website for the next book I would review, my eyes came upon Restless by Jennie Allen. I never heard of her previous book, Anything, or the praise it had received. I assumed it was just another book that a new author put together. It looked good, though. I was excited to read something about being restless in my faith and learning how to rest in Christ and live a life worthy of the Gospel. Unbeknownst to me, this book was listed under Women Issues. I am not a woman, but a man, so as I first opened the book I couldn't help to giggle because this is the first Women Issues book I had ever read. I am proud to say that this book was perfect for me. I highly recommend it and would pass it on to anyone.

The book is broken up into Parts. Allen starts with The Call then moves into The Threads, and finishes with Living on Purpose. The book is a response, or an answer, to readers responses from her previous book Anything. Where a lot of people got to a point where they would do anything for God, were then lost, they didn't know where to go. In Restless, Allen paints us a picture of who we are to live for, who we are, and why we are here. She writes beautifully. By the end of the book, she will feel like your new best friend. Its really easy to read, but also thought provoking and moving.

My favorite parts of the book were her journal inserts for you to do. There are parts of the book that are specially designated for you to write and fill in. My favorite one of these is a timeline of Gods Story. I thought this was super cool. I know my fianc is going to love reading this after I finally get it to her. Im sure you will love it to. If you ever think you are past or too mature for a book like this I would ask you to pray for humility and know that none of us have arrived and the evils in this world are the same evils inside of us.
God bless.",1391385600,2,2000,4.0327455919395465

171544,5,0849922372,"There are times we pick up a book and begin turning pages and we feel the Spirit move over us. We realize this book, these words, were created just for us. This is that book for me. There are times I have felt so restless. Wanting to serve, wanting to move, but feeling stuck and in a rut. This isn't what I was made for. I was created for more. I have a purpose. A distinct plan created just for me.

I want to share some of the phrases I have underlined throughout this book that wrapped around my soul and stirred my heart.

""He gave us His very self in the person of the Holy Spirit so that we would never be limited to achieve only what is possible on our best day. Dream big, believe big, and dare big during your one and only life on this planet. Impossible is where God starts and miracles are what God does."" Christine Caine

""There is a darkness that tries to spread the disease of ""be big"". Christ whispers the cure to the ego's disease: Decrease so I can increase."" Ann Voskamp

""The life that God has set in front of us is exciting, and adventurous, and risky. Sometimes it's even dangerous. And it's going to ask everything of us, because apparently it doesn't care much for our comfort or our happiness or our safety, and yet it is the kingdom that satisfies. It is the gospel that makes us whole and gives us purpose."" Jen Hatmaker

""In the quiet, surrounded by everything I thought I'd ever wanted, I felt that everything I'd ever wanted was strangling me. I loved my family, but in the process of making a family I had somehow lost myself. Passions were pushed aside, dreams had trickled away, and the needs of other people outside my family had escaped me.""

""This is a book about discovering ourselves and getting over ourselves all at the same time.""

""This book is about all that lies in our control and how nothing is in our control.""

""This is a book about vision and obedience.""

""I want you to dare to believe that God has a vision for how you are to spend your life. Because finding and accomplishing this vision  is quite possibly the greatest responsibility we have as a generation, second only to knowing and loving God.""

""Our creative God has an infinite number of creative plans to make Himself known  through us, His image bearers, so He sent His Spirit to give unique visions to unique people to reach the world in unique and beautiful ways.""

""To hide our gifts, or to deny them, or to compare and wish them away is not only taking from yourself; it is taking from God, His church, and a world that needs to see the expression of God you bring. It's the expression He designed you to bring to it.""

""To understand our purposes, we must understand God's ultimate agenda. God is most after His glory. And glory is the visible expression of God's goodness and beauty on this earth. It's how we recognize Him. The ultimate visible expression of God's glory on earth is Jesus. We are to live out the same call. God has chosen to show Himself and His goodness-His glory-through us. And like the millions of pixels that together are displaying Duck Dynasty on my TV right now as my kids are watching in the other room, every one of our unique callings will display God to our world.""

""All journeys have a cost. The path to our purpose here is rarely built comfortably. So are you restless enough to go here? Are you hungry enough for more to do the work?""

""The most inconspicuous tasks usually are building big things we can't see yet.""

I could go on and on sharing the words of this humbly, beautiful woman of God. This is one of those books you grab hold of and find Jesus within. It's a book you pass on to your friends. It's words you share with others to create beauty in this life.

Jennie Allen is transparent through her penned words. Jesus is alive within this book, within these words. Many times it's a bit hard to do a review on a book. It must be read and reviewed by a certain date. I read through this book for review and will now slow down and read it again. I know in reading it again I will find double blessings. Yes, this book is just that good.

This book was a gift from Thomas Nelson for sharing my review with you.",1390694400,,4170,4.336760925449871
171545,5,0849922372,"I have done other Jennie Allen Bible studies and was always so blessed and learned so much so I was so excited when I was given the opportunity to review this DVD for her latest Bible study, ""Restless"". This was just as wonderful as her other studies and I came away understanding God's Word in a deeper way.

The thing I love about Jennie Allen is that she is so open and real. She doesn't hold herself up as someone to emulate, but always refers us to God. She shares her own struggles and it let's us know that we all have struggles of one kind or another.

This study really focuses on the story of Joseph. I just finished an intense study of Genesis, so I was very aware of the story of Joseph. However, Jennie brings things out from the story of Joseph that I had never thought of. I love how she shares and reminds us that God has a plan for our lives and that we need to trust Him. She shares that we can be restless when we aren't living our lives for God and trusting Him with our futures.

I love how Jennie Allen really shares her heart and her love for God. It's a wonderful DVD and, with the corresponding books, would make a wonderful study for your church or small group.  I highly recommend it!

171546,5,0849922372,"Have you ever felt like something is missing in your life, in your walk with God? I have felt this way more times than I can count. In Restless, Jennie Allen uses the story of Joseph, the dreamer, to explain to us how the suffering Joseph endured, the gifts he received and the relationships that he had are threads of his life that miraculously fit into the story of God and how those same things in our lives can fit into the story of God also.

We all have gifts, passions, places, and relationships and they all are gifts from God. Ms. Allen explains how these aren't random that they are meaningful. And our suffering is truly a gift from God, and something that we can give back to the world.

This book is definitely life changing and will help you see that we don't have to be restless, that we can have that longing for more of God fulfilled. That are dreams are no longer dreams and our passions have a purpose, part of Gods greater plan.

I highly recommend this book for everyone who is longing for a closer relationship with God. Read it, share it and learn to help others have that closer relationship with God.

171547,5,0849922372,"I started the New Year with a new DVD Bible study; I received Jennie Allens Restless from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
 Unlike the previous Allen study I had review from the same publisher this one did not come with the leader material. Before I started watching the series of 8 videos I wondered how it would be possible to use the video on its own. Once I started watching it became very obvious that the DVD could be used independently.
 Restless is divided into 8 video sessions lasting about 20 minutes each. I really like that each session starts with a question and various ladies one by one shares her personal thoughts. Jennie then gets right into sharing her heart with a small gathering of ladies, in an intimate setting. She encourages them and the viewer to not get lost I the mundane of everyday life, but to strive for more, to seek and strive for what God has in store for us.
 Jennie uses scripture and true-life stories to inspire us to not settle for less than Gods plan for our lives.
 I find Allen to be very personable and completely likeable. She is transparent, admitting her failures and not afraid to let us see her tender heart.
 I will be watching the DVD videos again (and again, and again) and will definitely purchase the study guide.",1389657600,,1284,4.517241379310345
171548,5,0849922372,"on the same day.
 The 8  Restless dvd segments are inspirational.  It is important to stop, listen and be reminded of God's intentionality and purpose for each life.  Re-evaluate.  We become ""restless"" for a reason.  I watched the ""baby box"" and felt just this.  Restlessness must result in action.
 How can I help?
 What can I do?
 It might start with praying, but it has to result in DOing something.
 Jennie Allen discusses through the sessions how God has a purpose for each person.  That purpose begins in the unique way He created you and place He puts you.  (In other words, start right where God has you, with the people right around you.  Love and care for them...and maybe, if you are like me, show them the baby box too :) and ask them to join in and pray about how to help).
 Are you RESTless?
 Good!
 Maybe there is a need for another ""baby box""

171549,5,0849922372,"Here's the deal: If you are even reading these reviews and looking to buy Jennie Allen's second book, RESTLESS, then you KNOW there is more out there. The truth is we need to get over ourselves, as Moses needed to do when he stressed over his own weaknesses, and it wasn't even about him. It was about what God desired to do THROUGH him for the benefit of the millions of Israelites who needed a faithful, ever-present, loving, and rescuing God to deliver them from slavery. RESTLESS challenges us to look around us and find out who needs God and pursue them using the gifts, talents, and resources that God has allowed us to have. We need to see that we have been created not to ""piddle"" around, but to discover the threads that make up the tapestry of our lives and use them to glorify our Lord while we are here. READ THIS BOOK if you want to grow spiritually while you are discovering who your really are.",1389398400,52,909,4.384615384615385
171550,5,0849922372,"Like sitting down with that best friend who knows you better than you know your self, this book is both conversational and releasing.  Familiar ground, and a dare to sail uncharted waters. Jennie Allen gives you the map to a scavenger hunt for the threads of your own life and permission to dream as you gather them together. Not heavily theological or philosophical it simply speaks at a heart level and invites you into a journey most of us feel too isolated to take. This book feels like an invitation to wade into a river flowing in real time, and although the IF Gathering in Austin is the upcoming movement being alluded to, I think there will always be opportunities and moments of decision for women to wake up from fearful frozen inertia and step into our dreams and destinies, and to remember how important and permission giving other women's voices can and should be.
""We make a beautiful exchange:
Our short lives for forever.
Our moving sand for the rock of a God who adores you.
Our chains for running wild and free.
Our unsatisfying wind for the substance of a purpose that will never fade""",1389052800,2,1105,4.6091370558375635
171551,5,0849922372,"Like Jennie's first book, Anything, God used Restless to impress upon my heart a deep desire to live fully surrendered and in complete, radical obedience to Him.  So many people search for their purpose in life - everyone's purpose is to make God known among the nations. It was one of Jesus' last commands before He died. Months ago, I was feeling restless for living out God's plans for my life.  I deeply desired to live for Him, but was overwhelmed and lacked clarity. God has used this book to show me how my past experiences and struggles, along with my passions, are intricately woven together for His greater purpose.  Please note, as a reader you won't be given a clear-cut answer to your life's path to purpose.  But, you'll be encouraged to reflect on your life to date, seek God's voice, and ask for clarity in order to live out God's will for you.  Jennie's deep passion for Christ and making Him known is soul piercing and contagious. She's real and transparent.  I highly recommend this book if you're ready to stop living your comfortable life in which you're following your dreams in order to lose your life as you know it to chase after God-sized dreams. To live is Christ, to die is gain, and Jennie guides us to do so.",1389052800,,1238,4.5291479820627805
171552,5,0849922372,"Restless is an inspiring book written in engaging language drawing the reader into a deeper knowledge of God and of themselves. Jennie Allen is a talented writer sharing many stories to illustrate her information. Restless is packed full of quotable statements like I waded through a decade of the seemingly mundane, but if someone didn't change my childrens diapers they would not be able to change the world. And I think God could untangle your soul, your story, your gifts, your people, your place, and your passions, and weave it into purposes you haven't been brave enough to imagine. If you have been restless, perhaps feeling a pull on your life that there must be more, whether you know the purpose or not and even if you haven't felt the pull yet; Restless first inspires the reader though illustration, testimony, and excellent writing and then assists the reader to delve into what their personal gift, story, and purpose may be through valuable exploration exercises, questions, and journaling throughout the book.",1389052800,,1026,5.041176470588235

171554,5,0849922372,"First off, this book strikes a balance (or rather, a tension) of personal development and spirituality, and keeping it real (and light hearted, at appropriate times) and grounded in God. Since this is one of the overarching qualities I look for in the people I have in my life (them being in the world but yet not of it), I felt like Jennie was a dear friend sitting across from me speaking MY language, The language that talks deep + spiritual + crazy impactful but can throw in jokes + cultural lingo.

Secondly, when I was having doubts in my mind (for example, when I finished putting my ""threads"" together + was doubting if I was good enough or had any passions, she wrote an entire chapter on shrinking back just a chapter ahead) she seemed to read my mind and speak to it on multiple occasions.

Thirdly, I'm really grateful Jennie addressed at the beginning of Restless that soul searching is ok to do but is only meant to be a quick season...not something we do forever + ever.

Finally, this book will not give you all the answers, you have to put in the elbow grease, late night wrestlings, and conversations with dear friends + family members to really make this work. This book is supposed to spur you on towards action....because thinking + dreaming will only you get you so far to figuring things out. So be bold + ask your people vulnerable questions about yourself + your gifts and your risk will be rewarded with clarity. Believe me.

I was humbled by reading this book since it reminded me that life isn't all about me/my ideal life/comfort, but it also pushed me past my insecurity/doubts of not being good enough to do this dream or that thing and whispered to me that if God calls you to do it, He alone can do it through you. And He can do it better than you could have ever imagined.

I can't tell you how many sentences are underlined and how many times I wrote ""YES!"" in the columns. Jennie has a beautiful way of using her real and relatable voice and story to grab your hand, pull you up and push you along. Regardless of your specifics, you will be able to use this book. You will love the journaling prompts she gives you too. That might have been one of my favorite parts. You can't just read this book and move on. You have to process. You have to decide.

Growing up, we built up false images and expectations for what this season of our lives was supposed to produce. Jennie Allen isn't afraid to be honest and she isn't your average friend who covers up your fears and your insecurities with silver bullets and fluffy words.

Restless is a real look at God, our lives in light of His story, and the individual threads in our lives that are intended for huge, meaningful things. This book met me in my restlessness and exposed bondage that I didn't even realize was entrapping me. Once freed, God was able to use my life in ways that I never dreamed possible. Sounds cheesy, but it is the honest to God truth.

This book is...
a must read.
a tool for the Holy Spirit to bust your heart open.

171558,5,0849922372,"I received the ""Restless DVD Bible Study"" by Jennie Allen, complimentary from the gracious team at BookSneeze.  I in turn agreed to write this review.  Well, I can tell you that it is my joy to write this review as I was anticipating receiving this study since I found out Jennie completed it.  I was introduced to Jennie Allen a few years ago when she released her first bible study, ""Stuck"" (AMAZING STUDY), and I have been able to read and complete her following books and bible studies.

  Jennie's ""Restless"" study is based on the life of Joseph from the Bible, and she leads participants through a practical plan to identify the ""threads"" of their lives.  Jennie hopes that through the study women (and men) will find out how to weave those ""threads"" together for God and His glory and purposes.

  Some of the topics that are covered during the 8 week study are; God's story,  gifts, suffering, people and passions.  The format of this study is different from Jennie's last two studies as she is teaching before a live audience, and some of her friends share their stories on the DVD.  I have loved her last two studies so it is hard for me to say that this one is better, but I can say it is just as good and the messages Jennie teach are powerful and life changing.  I really truly believe that if a person lets God lead her through this study her life could be changed forevermore.

  I believe Jennie has been gifted by God, and she is one of the voices of our generation that is calling people back to God.  She is passionate for people to know Jesus and experience a relationship with Him that is life changing.  She is true to the ""Gospel"" message and she will tell you the truth even when it is hard.  Jennie has stated that her heart is to equip and unleash the followers of Jesus to live and love Him and others.

  I understand that there are those that may read this review that don't have a relationship with God and maybe curious as to what all of this ""talk"" is about.  Although this study is geared toward the follower of Jesus, I believe it could be used to introduce someone  to what God's Story is all about.

 I am sure it is clear from my review, but I highly recommend this study by Jennie Allen and I cannot wait to read the paperback book when it releases.",1389052800,4,2287,4.35781990521327

It has pushed me to lean on the passions that God has given me and helped clarify the beauty of the story of redemption God has created with my life.

Carve out time in your life where you read this uninterupted (expected stoping for life events). I am meaning focus on reading it over a course of time you set out for yourself and actually finish it. Use the margins to write out what you heart the Lord speaking to you while reading page to page, because He's going to. You may not have ever heard Him speak to you before. This is your time! Be ready! I read this book while writing a book of my own. It was a great companion for the work the Lord was already doing in my life.
