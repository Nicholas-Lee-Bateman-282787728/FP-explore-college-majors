3730416,4,B001OIQGTG,"This movie is worthless from the acting point of view but is priceless for featuring Borrah Minevitch and his Rascals on harmonicas.  The young singer was like Deanna Durbin except for being an octave higher (if you can imagine that).  So it is a bit screetchy but still an amazing wonder of a vocal range for oddity's sake.  The harmonicas and their players are so interesting, with long ones, short ones, thin ones fat ones, and made me want to hear a whole album of them. So do rent this movie (hard to get) to hear this amazing harmonica band of about twenty guys.",1263427200,3,568,4.4423076923076925
3730417,2,B001OIQGTG,"This film is 90 minutes of pure musical agony. I hadn't seen this film for years, and then I only remembered parts of it. The parts I did remember were the dialogue scenes between Kay Francis and estranged hubby Walter Huston, and between Huston and the children who do not know him. This part of the film is very good and made me want to see it again.

When I saw it again in September 2008 for the first time in years on TCM I was horrified. Worse, I was somewhat bored. Either I never saw or my memory blocked out the musical portions. Obviously, Warner Bros. was trying to turn Gloria Warren into their own Deanna Durbin, but she just lacked the ""star quality"" Durbin had and was a completely uninteresting actress, at least in this film.

The film could have been a great one if the music had been eliminated and the focus kept on the melodrama - a man (Walter Huston) getting out of prison and giving up a woman who loves him and his children so they can all have some security with a rather bland fellow who wants to marry the woman (Kay Francis). Instead, Huston paces from the ""good"" side of town where we are tormented by Warren's operatic screeching, to the ""bad"" side of town where a novelty harmonica band act torments us some more. Just goes to proves bad music has a home in both the low-brow and high-brow varieties.

If you want to see what Kay Francis and Walter Huston can do for a film without all of this distraction thrown in, try to track down a copy of 1929's ""Gentlemen of the Press"". There they both really sizzle.",1238803200,4,1540,4.340277777777778
3730418,5,B001OIQGTG,"I'd been drawn to the movie initially by the fact that it included a young Diana Hale (then billed as Patty Hale) in the cast. Diana would go on to be a featured singer with the original Vogues singing trio in 1958 (not related to the later popular 1960's quartet). This apparently was her first movie, whereas she would later go on to be featured in two FLICKA movies with Roddy McDowell. Aside from that, everything else about the movie would be icing on the cake. Or so I thought...

This Movie far exceeded my expectations! As a Family Drama, it can be compared to with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which wouldn't happen for another 4 years. All the characters bond wonderfully, given their individual trials throughout the movie (I won't spoil it by giving away any of the plot, which is partially inaccurate in the description). The movie allowed the characters to develope enough to the point of drawing you in and to feel what they were feeling. The musical numbers were all well done. I'm no fan of operatic singing, but my eclectic tastes allowed me to fully enjoy Gloria Warren's fine voice. The harmoica playing by the Rascals balanced it out so well that I think anyone of any musical taste would enjoy it.

If you get a chance to see this movie, even once, by all means SEE IT! Apparently the movie is only available as a Brazilian Import, but the movie settings can be adjusted without any subtitles.

The only downside to the DVD itself was that the maker of the DVD flashed it's decal every so often in the corner of the screen, a couple of times I noticed during the opening credits, and then once (that I caught) during the middle of the movie. Aside from that, I thank them for not overdoing it.

8330704,3,B001OIQGTG,I bought it because I love the music and the performances by Borrah Minivitch and the Harmonica Rascals.  The story is very corny but typical of the time.  Too bad it wasn't released for English audiences.  Thank goodness the dialog was in English,1365033600,,247,4.6976744186046515
8330705,5,B001OIQGTG,The movie met all my expectations. My wife and I watch a movie every Sunday so I'm always looking for movies that will not seem offensive. Those that have music and/or animals usually meet with our approval.,1347408000,2,207,4.621621621621622
8330706,5,B001OIQGTG,"You will enjoy the beautiful music of Ernesto Lecuona performed by a very young Gloria Warren in her first ever film and a wonderful band of amazing harmonica players. My daughter, that had never seen before movies from that era, told me, totally amazed: ""Did you see the brightness in the eyes of those people?""
True. Those were more innocent times. Beautiful music and a silly story plot could entertain us and touch our hearts then, and maybe even now if you are ready to open yourself to this warm, old movie from a long lost innocent era.",1321920000,4,543,4.551020408163265
