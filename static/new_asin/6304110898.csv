8569907,5,6304110898,"Braveheart is an unforgettable movie, filled with so much passion and commitment it tends to humble anyone who tries to stay true to their own beliefs.  The total lack of respect for life by the King as he throws his  son's lover to his death or orders the murder of thousands of Scots creates  such anguish for the viewer while instilling a deep appreciation for the  human spirit.  The acting in this film is superb.  Mel Gibson deserved a  best actor award for his portrayal of William Wallace.  This is by far his  very best work.  The scenes were so true to life and compelling that I  found myself thinking about this movie days after I saw it.  Now that's a  sign of a great movie!",964396800,,688,4.365079365079365
