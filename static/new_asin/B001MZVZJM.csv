8322693,5,B001MZVZJM,"The two disks have first person accounts of several American and British experiences as prisoners of the Nazis.  The first disk deals with how and when the men were captured, some being ground soldiers and some bomber/fighter crewmen.  In truth, this part is a bit tedious, but it is necessary to the overall understanding of what happened to the men.  The second much more interesting disk is about the men's interrogation and then being sent to the various stalags, and finally to their liberation and return home.

The stalags were much different from the concentration camps for civilians.  On the whole, the prisoners were not treated badly.  They were allowed to receive Red Cross packages, which contained foodstuffs and cigarettes that were unavailable to their German guards.  The food provided by the Reich was not plentiful and the prisoners lost weight.  However, they had about the same rations as the guards.  Withal the captivity was not a pleasant experience, it must be admitted.  Still, the camaraderie was something the men treasured for the rest of their lives.

I have done a great deal of research about POWs, with the majority being prisoners during the American Civil War.  Surprisingly enough, the feelings experienced are much the same.  A man feels somewhat emasculated, even guilty, that others are fighting and they are on the shelf, waiting, dependent upon the enemy and forced to obey him.  Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by this.  As an aside, the prisoners of the Japanese suffered a much worse fate, and POWS in the Korean and Vietnam wars had yet different and much worse experiences.

Fans of bloody war stories may not find the accounts in these disks very exciting, but they are part of the larger story of the war and are worthy of our attention.",1302220800,3,1788,4.91
