The production values are quite low, the content is dry and stuffy with no story line and poor transitions.  It feels a bit like it was made in maybe the 80s.  I watched it with my 12-year-old son in preparation for our upcoming trip to Australia.  I found the movie Walkabout to give both of us a better feel for the culture.

If other reviewers can recommend other videos that would be much appreciated.",1485734400,,529,4.574468085106383

To know more about it you have to purchase the DVD. Yes, these are more black people who are an extention of the African Diaspora. A documentary called Tracking the first Americans gives proof.",1393977600,3,322,4.981481481481482
