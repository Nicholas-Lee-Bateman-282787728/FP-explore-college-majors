8030597,4,B0002Q9VWA,So far this is a good anime. The artistry is appealing.  I like the story line and hope it pays off in the end.,1377302400,,111,3.625
8030598,4,B0002Q9VWA,"Gungrave is a good story about a couple of friends that move up from being street punks to the leaders of a powerful mafia organization. Brandon, the main character is murdered by his partner, Harry, and returns from the grave to take revenge and set things right again. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell. There a lot of really awesome characters and fight scenes in this anime. There is also enough drama and character development to keep you wanting more.

The animation and voice acting are pretty good. You should recognize many of these voice actors. Overall this is a really good anime. Especially for one based on a video game. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1354147200,,675,4.625
8030599,5,B0002Q9VWA,"This dvd gives a better look into the technology that brought Brandon back to life.

 Brandon has now settled into his own little part of Millenion and has even started his own sweeper team known as True Grave rivaling that of Bear Walken's Over Kills. However with the early release of a man called Blood War Harry and Brandon must fight hordes of undead soldiers brought back to life by the necrolyzation project. There is a traitor in Millenion and Harry's ambitions are more revealed as a little information about Lee's past is introduced. Jump ahead a few years, Brandon and Harry and the others have made names for themselves. Harry is now one of the most well known men in Millenion and Brandon is now the Symbol of Millenions power. However Brandon's feelings for Maria are going cold. Sensing the way things will go if this continues Big Daddy makes a very important decision.
  This disk has many great action scenes and a better look into the necrolyzation project. Also introduced is Fangoram the monsterous Deadman from Gungrave Overdose for those of you who have played. You only see Fangoram for a few seconds but he's there. Darkness looms over the horizon for both our boys and everything is about to culminate.",1111708800,4,1228,4.751173708920188
8030600,4,B0002Q9VWA,"With the exception of the pilot episode, Gungrave is primarily flashbacks of the main characters life. The first two DVDs have really in-depth story lines, but not as much action compared to the first episode. The third collection is probably the best so far for the series since it really picks up on Brandon's shooting techniques and introduces the infamous necrolization project that eventually turns Brandon into Beyond the Grave. It still has the intrigue in Millenion with a traitor in the organization and Harry's ambitions realized. Look for Fangoram(or at least one who looks like him) from Gungrave: Overdose on the episode called ""Kind.""",1103155200,6,648,5.180952380952381
