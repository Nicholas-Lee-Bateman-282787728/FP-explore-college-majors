7788388,4,0757919324,"Well, it wasn't quite what I expected.  Joe is probably a better player than he is a teacher, but there are some interesting ideas here.  He presents things in a somewhat vague manner, so what i took away from it was more of a general feel for how he thinks about things rather than specific examples I would want to practice.

Joe has a take on jazz lines that I hadn't seen before-- rather than focus on scales, he focuses on chords, though as he says what you end up with are still essentially patterns that are scales, he's inclined to think about it differently, and that's not a bad thing to contemplate.  His take on it is streamlined and interesting, and gives me some ideas on how to further develop my playing by inventing some new patterns in ways perhaps related to his but hopefully producing results more in my own style.

I don't see myself learning his specific examples here, as I'm not looking to play his style exactly, but improve on my own-- with that in mind, it provides some ideas on how to develop some of my own jazz lines based on chord structure in ways I hadn't considered before-- for that it's certainly worthwhile.

Others may find it useful to learn the specific passages he supplies here, but his unique outlook on his playing is what I think is most valuable to me.",1339200000,3,1300,4.4411764705882355

Joe Pass is so naturally musical its ridiculous. In this video, Joe plays a bunch of licks over Major, Minor, Dominant and ii Vs that are transcribed in standard notation. If you can't read, you can still use your eyes and ears to visually and aurally cop them. After learning a few licks over each chord type, even if you don't analyze what makes them tick, you should be able to phrase better and start to see patterns in his playing. By imitating Joe's lines, I learned a ton about the grammar of jazz.

This DVD was what took me that step beyond scales and arpeggios into playing coherent jazz lines. Joe can be goofy and absent minded and does not deeply analyze chord progressions or talk about modulations, he just simply plays.

If you are seeking a survival guide to make it through solos at a jam session.  This lesson should give you the improvisational material you've been seeking.

Abstractly similar to Bach, Joe Pass isn't utilizing any concepts out of the ordinary, its just the results are extraordinary. The chords he uses are the common grips that everyone else uses and the fingerings he uses aren't unusual. Its more about how he puts it all together that creates that beautiful synergy.",1321660800,3,1425,5.209606986899563

If you want to learn from the source, this is it.",1252972800,2,136,3.892857142857143
7788393,5,0757919324,"very good - i suggest looking at other guitar players too, to avoid sounding exactly like Joe Pass

a very wise teacher, makes you re-think jazz guitar in easier terms",1168473600,,167,4.566666666666666
7788394,5,0757919324,"IF you love Larry Carlton, you must love Joe Pass. After all, he is the ultimate jazz guitar man who taught Larry when he was a teenager. The title ""Joe Pass Jazz Lines"" is what it is, Jazz Lines. Don't expect much dialogue from his previous instructionals. He sits down and he starts playing, phrase by pharse. There are tons of music theory that he does not explain. But if you have some music theory at hand, these ideas can really come in handy. A small study booklet with notes, no tabs, is provided so you can practice along. Again, Joe's DVDs are all choked full of inspiration and ideas.",1155254400,7,595,4.418181818181818
7788395,5,0757919324,"this dvd comes with all of the examples he plays in written music which helps so much when learning his lines.  Learn to read music, it opens ur mind!!",1141084800,,151,4.206896551724138
7788396,5,0757919324,"The DVD includes a booklet with all of the video examples transcribed on the treble clef - with absolutely no tablature.  If you live off of tab then I wouldn't recommend this video, but if you can read music there is a wealth of information to study and learn from.

Joe breaks everything down to its simplest form - major, minor, or dominant.  He covers everything very quickly and then goes to the examples, which he gives plenty of.  However, if you're hoping for some chord melody tips or counterpoint examples you'll be disappointed with this video - it covers exactly what the title says: Jazz LINES.  He does speak a little bit in the beginning about how he views chords but he doesn't go beyond that.

For anyone looking to learn about playing jazz lines, improvising, or about Joe's lead style in general, this is a fantastic buy.  If you can't read music but are interested in Joe's style and can learn visually without too much grief, I would recommend the video, but the ability to read will certainly help you to get as much from the material presented as possible.",1119916800,26,1079,4.588541666666667
