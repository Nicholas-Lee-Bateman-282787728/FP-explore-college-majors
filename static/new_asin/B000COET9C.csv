2467591,5,B000COET9C,My husband and I really enjoyed these DVDS. They were very well done. I plan on sharing them with my friends and family. Worth the money and the time.,1210464000,,150,4.206896551724138

2467593,5,B000COET9C,"You can't make a person believe in God, but if they are open to the idea, these videos take the world around us and demonstrate logically that science completely supports the existence of the God of the Bible.  If you already are a Christian, this will bolster your appreciation of the love and wisdom of the creator.",1204156800,,317,4.56140350877193
2467594,5,B000COET9C,This documentary is absolutely amazing - filled with beautiful space shots from the Hubble Telescope and filled with factual detail on how our earth fits so specially into our solar system.  Anyone interested in astronomy or the spiritual aspect of how and why our earth is where it is should view this film!,1202428800,2,308,4.811320754716981
2467595,5,B000COET9C,"What an eye opener these videos are!
Wow!!!, did they ever lie to us in the public school system! They lied in what they told us... and what they ""didn't"" tell us!!!
We truly Do live in a ""privileged"" universe, AND an even more ""privileged"" planet. Open your mind, and watch these videos!!! I have been forcing my family to watch them, and guess what? They thanked me later!!!",1190419200,5,376,4.463768115942029
2467596,4,B000COET9C,"A great in depth study of the uniqueness of our planet and those that call it home.  I have read reviews that state that the ending has a religious spin to it, but the authors are only taking the evidence to its logical conclusion.  Highly recommended!",1189987200,4,252,4.456521739130435
2467597,5,B000COET9C,"The one-note song of evolution has dominated the origins scene so long that evolutionists no longer think they have to answer tough questions that challenge the theory.  These fine videos asked logical, probing questions that need to be addressed, not simply dismissed.  When we could have a symphony of ideas being discussed and debated, why do we continue to settle for the monotony of the ""Our way or the highway"" attitude of so many evolutionists?  Science should be about challenge, discovery and growth, not stagnation and intellectual bigotry.",1156982400,34,550,5.2272727272727275
2467598,5,B000COET9C,"I am an educator with a Masters in Education as is my wife. We found these riveting. We have watched them over and over and shared them with a number of others. I cannot remember my favorite lines and our set is currently loaned out, but suffice it to say that we highly recommend these.

If you know nothing about Intelligent Design these are a great starting point. We have found that too many people have discounted this movement and lumped it into the Creationist camp without doing their homework.

This is not a Creationist viewpoint, but it certainly points out that evolution as a theory is archaic (remember that a naturalist with little experience postulated the theory 150 years ago. The theory has always been embroiled in controversey and as we have deepened our knowledge evolution has had to be modified so that now it is an idea with many defectors and factions.

ID asks questions which are cogent and salient even if the demagogues of evolution find them provocative. Anyone who refuses to look at the challenges to there positon or beliefs must question the truth of them.

We found the series very enjoyable and think you will as well.",1156204800,28,1155,4.702970297029703
2467599,5,B000COET9C,"Both are informative and intriguing. Great information presented by experts, easily understood, well thought out and presented! I highly recommend these videos!",1371254400,,160,6.318181818181818
2467600,3,B000COET9C,"I know my husband enjoys almost anything science-based, and this DVD set is no exception. It's okay with me.  I enjoy a little.",1358380800,,127,4.521739130434782
2467601,5,B000COET9C,"These are the two videos I would select to represent the fledgling Intelligent Design Theory!  The first, ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"" is one of the finest science documentaries, of any sort, that I have seen; it concerns itself a fair degree with the inner workings of the cell.  ""The Priviledged Planet"" obviously is  generally broader in scope as pertaining to the subject matter.  And we see some of the finest scientists of today on these videos; and though reasonably in depth, it is meant for the layman.  A great gift for someone wanting to learn more about Intelligent Design Theory; or for the young student desiring to learn more about the Universe we live in.  Additionally, and more extensively, we are presented with an excellent critique of Naturalism/Darwinism.  A wonderful compilation.",1323993600,,806,5.0606060606060606
2467602,5,B000COET9C,Job well done and easy to understand; my young teenagers enjoyed these DVD's as well,1284336000,,84,4.666666666666667
2467603,5,B000COET9C,I bought these DVDs sometime back. They are fantastic and very educational. I watch them every now and then to reinforce the information.,1281830400,,137,5.0
2467604,5,B000COET9C,"I watched Privileged Planet twice and remembered more with each viewing.  It's absolutely amazing how God made a very very special place for us to protect us.  Then when you compare this planet with the others that are so completely inhospitible, it's just awesome how He even beautified it for OUR PLEASURE...It's reassuring to know that God is still in control and always will be.

Unlocking the Mystery of Life is so exciting to watch.  To actually believe in Darvin's Theory of Evolution is ludicrous!  We are truly beautifully and wonderfully made!",1281052800,,553,4.967391304347826
2467605,5,B000COET9C,"For anyone who has the intelligence to look out at our world and see its beautiful design and say, ""This can't be accidental"", these DVDs will confirm your beliefs with real Scientific evidence.  For those who say Science and God are mutually exclusive, I say view these videos, then think again.",1261699200,3,296,4.803921568627451
2467606,5,B000COET9C,"The two DVD's are a must see for anyone questioning why are we here!
It did not happen by chance.
Intelligent design, a creator? see for yourself",1261612800,2,145,4.407407407407407
2467607,5,B000COET9C,"Finally the movies what give a purpose and meaning of Life has been released!

The ""Privileged planets"" complete ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"" DVD. It's good thinking to put them together.
The major idea of both movies leads to understanding that everything from atoms through Galaxies to life is exactly on the place where it supposed to be. No God looking like man could create all this. It's something more global. The Bible has nothing to do with this. But something what is more intelligent let all this happened. And it had its purpose and meaning.
  First movie gives some examples which shows you that nothing comes to live by random choice, that theory of natural selection is only can lead to reduce variety of species when in fact it is not. That simple rock is just a rock till you make something like figure of it. It was not made by itself. You designed all shapes. And someone else who can see distinguish forms will say: it was made on purpose by someone who had some meaning. The same way were created all living creatures. Darwin's theory can't explain complexity of all living organisms. There is gaps and unresolved by himself mysteries when he was building his theory. He was not physicist to explain how the atoms came to complicit structure. He was simply ""observer"" of already existing complicity.
 Even if all molecules come together because they ""had a lot of time"" for repelling or gluing with each other through formation of complex living matter and finally came to such complexity as a thinking human. What the smart molecules they are! They ""know"" what they need and out of mindless random choice they finally built thinkers. And how that mindless molecules ""know"" that human is final destination? Well everything is pointing at Intelligent Design.
The second disk completes idea of Intellectual Design. It shows you how fragile our existence on Earth. That all conditions to make life possible are in very thin range precisely. I do no want to spoil your anticipation. It has a lot of excellent illustrations and animations. I just recommend to watch it.",1256515200,,2088,4.824022346368715
2467608,5,B000COET9C,"This DVD set is a must in anyones library for its amazing photography and scientific information. Children as well as adults will find these DVD's informative, entertaining and mind blowing when you are confronted with the beautiful and intricate wonders of life on this planet!
Education has always claimed evolution to be factual and yet evidence is all around us that life on earth could not have happened by chance no matter how great the mathematical probabilities are! Its simply absurd and illogical to presume that life in its complexity and diversity along with interactivity between all life forms could happen by chance.
The DVD's theme of creatorship is without a doubt the correct conclusion to come to when you consider the design aspects of all living things on Earth and in the Universe.
For those who would like to see something that supports Creatorship no matter what religious faith you adhere to will find this material faith strengthening.
Both DVD's are extremely well presented and the narration with John Rhys Davies, an actor of great talent, with a voice that emits strength of character should appeal to all sorts of individuals all over the world.
It is definitely a must have for families and those who simply enjoy our beautiful planet, Earth.",1251849600,4,1274,4.985915492957746

Intelligent design is for people who want an open and truthful look at what are planet our ourselves are about.  We purchased the two DVD set.  I watch them on flights regularly.

The universe is shown in all its complexity and yet in simplicity. You can decide on the facts.  You can go in the second DVD to this most microscopic parts of the world of living things.  The complexities are presented in an understandable way.  You will marvel at the structure of life.  You will not regret the purchase of these DVD's.",1241481600,3,475,4.413793103448276

2467613,5,B000COET9C,Scientific explaination to creation that makes so much more logical sense that the junk science that is shoved down our children's and our own throats from Godless people.,1232496000,,171,5.142857142857143
2467614,5,B000COET9C,"These DVD's break the strongholds established in academia. They open the way for true science without prejudice or junk science interfering. They provide clear and precise evidence of the origins of the universe and all creation, without preconceived notions or programmed responses. They follow the true scientific evidence, when their counter parts refuse to. These DVD's make a much stronger case for creation than the Darwinians make for evolution.",1227398400,2,452,5.565217391304348
2467615,5,B000COET9C,"The Privileged Planet and Unlocking the Mystery of Life are both very well produced, like something you'd see on NOVA (if they weren't so much in the tank for evolution). Everything shown is science and undebateable facts. The testimonies from top scientists are powerful, especially given that many of them are not creationists. The graphics and animation are extremely well done and invaluable. These DVDs are included with certain textbooks for classroom use but are probably not easily understood by children. However, high school students would have an easier time grasping some of the heavier science concepts which are presented. Previous knowledge of biology and statistics is helpful. These are not religious productions in any way. They are documentaries and present science and data with interviews from the scientists who did the work put together in a story-type fashion.",1219708800,5,884,5.366906474820144
2467616,5,B000COET9C,"This DVD set was full of facts and both were well researched.  Although many would not agree with the conclusion, I think everyone would have to agree that the evidence used was accurate and not in question.  Many people want this argument silenced but unfortunately the more I study the more I realize the ID argument has credence. Therefore it is necessary to have an open debate to increase our knowledge and at the very least strengthen the theories and knowledge that we accepted before all the evidence we now have was found.  The cell was once thought to be simple it is not, the universe shouldn't be near as organized as it is.  We need answers to these questions to expand our understanding of the beginning and order of things.",1219363200,,738,4.6106870229007635

2467618,5,B000COET9C,"Very well done. Honest. Very illuminating and educational. While highly intellegent people are involved, they keep the information accessable.

Based on Good Science.

It is amazing how the Truth comes out so easily when we approach our Scientific Process with out presuppositions....Like follow the facts and see where they take you ?? Radical ??

We highly recommend this. Watch The Privileged Planet first.",1212537600,,409,5.4603174603174605

8099887,5,B000COET9C,"I'm not a scientist nor any sort of amateur subject matter expert on this subject. But if there were a case for creation, it was just made. The beautiful aspect of this series is that one doesn't need to be religious to understand that ""mainstream"" science doesn't have all the answers even when they proclaim that they do. The current teachings about evolution and big bang are so full of errors, one cannot even imagine why they're being taught as fact! I'm not advocating creation be taught in public schools, but rather that evolution and the big bang not be taught as fact.

A close friend of mine, who believes without a doubt evolution is real, came away questioning her own beliefs. She did have her problems with the theories in this series, but those where minor in comparison to the questions she had about evolution.

This series is well produced and you won't be embarrassed to show your friends. It's very professional.

Another thought I had while typing this is that when Ken Hamm debated Bill Nye, I was reminded of this series. Ken Hamm's arguments were terrible and I think he clearly lost the debate because of the direction in which he decided to go. Had Ken used the guidelines in this series, he would have made a more compelling argument against teaching evolution as fact.",1392508800,,1297,4.6798245614035086
