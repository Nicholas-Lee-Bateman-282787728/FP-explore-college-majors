Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

For those who are unfamiliar with the history of the women's suffrage movement in Britain, director Sarah Gavron and screenwriter Abi Morgan have reminded us that the more radical participants did not follow the non-violent civil disobedience program as promoted by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during the 1960s Civil Rights movement here in America. Quite the contrary, the suffrage movement leader in Britain, Emmeline Parnkhurst (played by Meryl Streep in a brief cameo), called for violent protest. And as the film makes clear, the violent nature of the protests escalated from broken shop windows to bombs thrown into mailboxes, clashes with police and even the arson torching of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George's summer home.

Gavron and Morgan tell this historical story through the fictional lens of their protagonist, Maud Watts, a laundress from a working class background. I would say their character is atypical of a woman of 1912, the year in which the Suffragette narrative begins. It's a much safer bet to believe that the average woman of that time was sympathetic to the cause but disapproved of tactics involving any kinds of violent resistance.

While Maud might be atypical, Gavron and Moran argue in substance that she represents the type of radical Suffragette that actually was the catalyst in upsetting the social order, eventually leading to the vote for women. This was essentially Pankhurst's view initially toothat violence was the only language the men of the time understood. But the film's scenarists go a step further, suggesting that Maud is a symbol of victimization at the hands of a nefarious paternalistic society.

Maud is not only betrayed by the male establishment politically (note how her brave impromptu speech in front of Lloyd George falls on deaf ears), but she is subjugated by a coterie of evil sexist males at every turn. These males include her loathsome boss who apparently has been molesting his female employees for years (presumably even Maude) as well as her co-worker husband, Sonny, who locks her out of the house after she's arrested and then puts Maud's beloved son up for adoption. Then there's the matrons and prison officials who brutalize Maud and her colleagues, force feeding them against their will, not to mention the police, who club women in broad daylight, following peaceful demonstrations.

It's not that these things didn't happen, but it just seems all of them happen to Maud, making her less of a fully realized character and more fodder for agitprop. She even is part of the plot to firebomb Lloyd George's summer cottage. Fortunately there is one semi-fleshed out character that keeps things moderately interesting: the antagonist of the drama, Inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson), who tails Maud and her confederates, taking surveillance photos with his technologically innovative, newfangled camera. Steed has the best scene with Maud during a prison interviewhe informs her that the firebombing of Lloyd George's cottage almost claimed a victima housekeeper, who returned to the house after forgetting something and just missed being killed. Maud is nonplussed at Steed's ""means to an end"" diatribe and gets in her jabs in by pointing to the government's hypocrisy, who deny women their basic rights.

The weakest part of the script involves the climax. How does one tie up Maud's story? Well, just forget about her and focus on the plight of Emily Davison who became a martyr to the Suffragette cause in 1913. Ms. Davison had the unfortunate idea of making a statement at the Epsom Derby where King George V's horse was running in the annual race. In front of three separate Pathe newsreel cameras that were filming the event, she stepped under the railing and on to the racetrack while the race was in progress (amazingly, you can watch it all on Youtube!). Some believed she wanted to commit suicide but a modern day blowup of the footage reveals she was attempting to pin a banner on the horse as it raced by. Unfortunately the horse perceived Ms. Davison as an obstacle to jump over, but missed, bowling her over and crushing her skull (she died after four days in a coma).

We never do find out what happens to Maud after the tragic event at the Epsom Derby but do see actual newsreel footage of the thousands of women who attended Emily Davison's funeralthe true-life quiet dignity of her supporters outshines the perhaps misguided over aggressive militancy of a fictional Maud.

Suffragette features a number of both fictional and non-fictional supporting players that give one a flavor for whom was involved in the women's suffrage movement. Carey Mulligan does well as Maud Watts, adroitly capturing the intensity of the composite character Gavron and Morgan have served up here.

In the end the women's suffrage movement was a bit more complicated than one character's struggle against a monolithic sexist society. Notably Emmeline Pankhurst supported the British government during World War I and became a strident anti-Communist up until her death in 1928. As a basic history lesson, Suffragette manages to get a few things right historically about the women's suffrage movement, but is less convincing in its melodramatic treatment of its strident heroine.",1447718400,13,5322,5.092889908256881

7536732,3,B017Y01GOM,"If this film had been better directed, Carey Mulligan would have an Oscar.  She gives it her all, but the director has a different agenda.  I think it is important that a woman direct this script, but I wished that a female director who could have gotten the point across without using a sledge hammer to do it.  All of the women with speaking roles are saints, with the exception of the husband of Helena Bonham Carter's husband all of men are moustache twirling villains straight out of the silent movies.  Ben Whishaw and Brendan Gleeson have long since proven that they can add more shading to the one-dimensional characters they are asked to portray, but the director is not interested in whatever they have to offer.  As soon as it looks as though they are going to give a sympathetic look or gesture, she cuts away.  Whereas, she almost fetishizes scenes in which the women are brutalized.  Abi Morgan's script is good, as are the tech credits.  What's missing is a strong director such as Susanna Bier or Agnieszka Holland who could have gotten across the plight of the women without making all of the characters black or white.",1492646400,,1136,4.645
7536733,4,B017Y01GOM,"This is a very moving powerful film of a revolutionary time in Britain the fight for women's votes. It depicts the most militant part of their campaign, of violence, bombing, arson, and destruction of property, after many years of peaceful protest, leading up to the climax of the film when Emily Davidson martyrs herself under the King Horse during the Epsom Derby in 1913. In contrast to the typical Mary Poppins depiction of Suffragettes that it's all jolly japes by rich and middle class women, this is gritty and hard hitting showing the beatings, imprisonment and force feeding and the state suppression of the movement. Frustrated at not being listened to by the male establishment Emmeline Pankhurst called for a campaign of civil disobedience that we would think of today as terrorism. However the physical risk was for the most part undertaken by the women themselves and they aimed to not harm any human life. All the performances are strong. The lives of famous Suffragettes however are not shown,  and it's missing Sylvia Pankhurst, and Sophia Duleep Singh who are worthy of their own biopics but the complex history is likely too difficult to show cinematically. There are only fleeting appearances of Emmeline Pankhurst (played by Meryl Streep) who is mostly in hiding, and Emily Davidson herself.  It is based around the life of a fictional Suffragette Maud Watts sensitively and brilliantly played by Carey Mulligan, a working class women, of little education who has worked in a laundry from the age of 7 with no other future. She loses her job, is thrown out by her husband and loses her son due to her campaigning. The story is chosen it seems to me to show how important it was over time in raising the status of women, and how the poorer working class women, the foot soldiers of the movement often suffered unsung, much harsher treatment than those of higher status. All campaigns for liberties were hard won and not bestowed on people by benevolent politicians. And it's important film to see to understand how hard won the fight for women's votes were.",1492041600,,2077,4.864406779661017

7536771,5,B017Y01GOM,"This is about how the early suffragettes in England paved the way for women getting the vote.  Most takes place in 1912, though women actually didn't get the vote there until 10 years later.

I can't comment on the historical accuracy, but as a film it is moving and illuminating.

Carey Mulligan plays Maud Watts, a 24-year-old woman who has worked nearly her whole life in the ghastly conditions of an industrial laundry.  She blunders into the suffragette cause, despite universal opposition, when she is asked to testify before the Prime Minister, Lloyd George.  She is asked at the last minute, and comes unprepared, but delivers a moving speech about the slavery-like and nearly lethal conditions (to say nothing of the pitiful pay) of the work.

Mulligan's acting throughout is superb.  I have sometimes thought she lets her peach-like cuteness do her acting for her (or maybe her directors do), but here she goes all out and delivers a heartrending performance.

One of the subtler bits is this.  She goes into her boss's office and stumbles upon him raping a 12-year-old employee.  As the movie proceeds we see that Maud probably suffered the same fate, and of course no one mentions the crime.  No one would have believed it, and no one would have cared.

Helena Bonham-Carter is equally fine as an older, more experienced suffragette.  This is a departure for her: instead of the fiery almost manic quality she usually has, here she is physically sick and stoic to the point of depression.  An amazing turn.

Meryl Streep has all of 3 minutes on screen, and I am happy to say (for those who think she is Queen of the Accents), she and her accent stink.

All the other players are wonderful, however.  Of particular note is Brendan Gleeson, playing an old-line cop with lots of contradictions.

This movie manages to deliver a strong political lesson in oppression, and how oppressors never submit without a fight, and do it in an shocking and riveting way.",1478476800,,1967,4.803571428571429

7536785,5,B017Y01GOM,"This kind of movie just makes me piss off.
Any human being deserves the equal right. Any time any place.
Especially women.
Back in 1910's in London. Eveything seems not right.
Girls work like slaves, men they treat them like toys they even took possed of them sexually. sometimes they used them as their sexual desire fulfillment object. They all should be cut out certain part with knives at the spot!
Most of the girls are under age working like slaves! And not to loose their job, they had to give their bodies too? What the F!!

Carey Mulligan had no intension to be part of the women right movement in this movie. It was just accident when her colleague was brutally injured her face beaten by someone and couldn't deliver her speech in front of the members about why should women need the right to vote.
Cary came along and she delivers the reason in her own way not so passionate but in her own way.
Every women thought that the next day the law will be passed.
But no way it didn't.
The male said they don't need one. Simply they don't need one. Bummer!!

The husband of Carey even threw her out of the house because she began to be part of the group and went to the prison a couple of times.
He said you embarrased me.
One day he even took away the daughter to this couple without even aske the mother.
She lost everything.

Free from being a SLAVE, People's right to vote, basic right to work, some other country's colony all should be gone at once or be free.

They fought.
After a couple of failure they became organized.
They even became violent that's what they wanted right?
They put bombs everywhere just to be noticed.

Now there is this time when they finally had a chance to meet the king at the horse race.
They took the flag like figre written says 'All women has right to vote.'
One of the leading lady dashes to the horse track and sacrifices herself.
She was killed at the spot.
Many people noticed her all right.
Because of this incident many of the newspaper and mascom begins to realize about this matter.
After this many countries begin to gave the girls the right to vote.

I personally think that the sacrifice is the most holly thing in the world.
Tarkivsky' s Sacrifice I thought for a second.

Watch this movie with not so much expectations.

Ultimately it did, but the miserable conditions of the lives of the working woman in Britain in 1912, and the brutality those women met when they began to draw attention to their situation was hard for me to watch.  And then there is the situation of women today when things look better generally but with many signs that misogyny is still rampant: high rates of rape and the murder of women by their male partners, women still paid much less than men for equal work, and sexist comments by candidates running for president, for examples.  The film gives an inside look at the workings of patriarchal power, the complexities of political resistance, and the economic implications of the right to vote.
British women didn't win the right to vote until 1918 and U.S. women in 1920fifty  years after African American men.  Overall, the movie was an important reminder that women did not get the vote or any level of equality by being nice.",1468368000,2,978,4.695906432748538

Bummer.",1466380800,,343,4.508196721311475
7536835,3,B017Y01GOM,"Possible spoilers.  The right of women to vote is a relatively new event.  The most progressive countries didn't allow it until late in the 19th century.  And there are still many countries that prohibit it today.  This film deals with England in 1912 as women were getting organized and pressing Parliament to pass a law to allow them the vote.  The film provides plenty of evidence as to why it was so important.

Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) works in a laundry, as does her husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw, Spectre).  They have a young son who they handoff to a care provider.  Maud hates her job.  It is not only low-paying, but the hours are long and the work is difficult and dangerous.  And of course, she has a miserable, misogynistic boss (Geoff Bell, Storage 24), who is not only an unsympathetic overseer but is prone to sexual harassment.  Maud is approached by a new worker, Violet Miller (Ann-Marie Duff, Closed Circuit) who encourages Maud to attend a suffragette meeting.  The movement is headed by Emmeline Pankhurst played by Meryl Streep, who has but a few minutes of actual screen time.  When Maud is drawn deeper into the movement, her husband kicks her out of the house and refuses to let her see their son.  This was the law at the time.  Maud and her compatriots are jailed, beaten and otherwise shunned by the populace.

The film is directed by Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane), and provides some authentic sets and costumes.  The film occasionally lapses into traditional movie clichs but is otherwise on target, showing the difficulties the movement faced.  The performances are first rate, especially Ms. Mulligan who I first remember in An Education. Helena Bonham Carter (Cinderella) is also terrific as the head of the local chapter of the movement.

In the final act, Maud and another sympathizer, Emily Wilding Davison (Natalie Press, Island) go to a horse race where King George is scheduled to attend.  They want to display a banner asking for support in front of the king and the hordes of photographers in attendance.  When their original location is blocked by security, Ms. Davison decides to put it up on the track as the horses are rounding the turn.  Bad idea, although it did get the attention of the press.  Makes you wonder if the film should have been made about her.  The women got the right to vote in England, but in stages.  First in 1918 (over 30 and property owners) and in 1928 (over 21).  The U. S. made it legal in 1920.",1466380800,,2462,4.68065268065268

7536867,5,B017Y01GOM,"Carey Mulligan starred in Blink, my all-time favorite episode of Doctor Who.  I almost didn't recognize her here in this story of a young woman in Victorian England who toils in a laundry and begins to hope there is a chance for a better life and a better world for women.  Being recognized as having a vote meant being recognized as a human being, something unthinkable for most women at the time, and still an unreachable goal for millions women in the world today.  People may not agree with the actions taken by the followers of Mrs. Pankhurst, but we all benefit from the results.

Growing up in America, I was never taught in school about the horrors suffered by women prior to (and in many cases, after) the U.S. government abandoning the denial of their right to vote.  A woman had no control over any meaningful aspects of her life, all being controlled, often with brutality, by the man who, essentially, owned her and all her (legally his) property and her (legally his) children.

I was shocked when I saw a documentary, probably in the 1990s, about the appalling violence American women were subjected to when they demanded their rights.  You only have to read the comments by trolls on the Internet to imagine what happened (and Ill be surprised if a few don't comment here).  We didn't have Internet trolls back in the 1990s, so the history of the womens movement was a shock to me.  I set about asking friends and family if they were aware of the brutality women faced when they dared to say they should be able to vote; every single person told me they had never heard of it and couldn't believe it really happened.  Not in America, was a frequent comment.  Well, folks, welcome to reality.

7536959,4,B017Y01GOM,"The women who fought for our rights do need our thanks. However, like any other social change, some fought for change while others enjoyed status quo and their position in the scheme of things.

Enter Carey Mulligan, who plays Maud Watt.  She is a laundress, poor, married, and has one young son.  She's been working since she was twelve in terrible conditions, scraping by to make a life.  For the most part, she's accepted her lot in life.  Appears to be happy in her marriage and a fulfilled mother.

Then she recognizes someone at work, who is part of a demonstration, and throws a stone through a store window shouting, ""Votes for women!""  Appalled, frightened, and not quite sure what to think of it, she eventually becomes part of the movement.  She attends a rally to check out the cause but is not a suffragette filled with the heated emotion to bring upon change.

When she is arrested and thrown into prison for her participation, things drastically change.  Her husband turns against her and locks her out of the home because she is an embarrassment and cannot be controlled by a good whack, like other wives. Eventually, unable to care for their son, he adopts the child out to another family.  Maud loses everything -- home, marriage, and child -- which merely fuels her desire to fight the good fight more radically.

The movie focuses on more than women demanding the vote. It paints a picture of the struggles that women, in general, went through to become more than wives and mothers in a male-dominated society.

I've recently been reading historical news clippings from Salford, U.K. (my ancestry research), and came across an interesting article when women finally got the vote in 1918. It was reported that women were among the first voters in every polling district to show up the first time they could vote, eager to exercise their freedom. However, one woman interviewed by a reporter stated afterward, Is that all it is? Apparently, after the years of suffering to get there, when it finally happened, all the hype didn't meet the expectations of some ladies.  I'm sure that's not the case with all who fought for the right to have a voice.  Frankly, I think it was a bit of a sarcastic twist on behalf of the reporter.

As far as the movie goes, it's historically interesting. If you hate male domination and the thought that women need to be put in their place, this movie may not be for you. Violence is used against demonstrators as if they deserved every blow.",1458172800,2,2491,4.691954022988506

7536965,4,B017Y01GOM,"The story is powerful and dramatic and while the characters are fictional they are based on historical truth. The suffragette movement in Britain is difficult to appreciate in today's world 100 years later yet delivers a message that injustice and inequality were very much institutionalized. People, in this case men, were largely opposed with providing women the right to vote and the institutions of the time, the police, the government, the courts and the newspapers were where the opposition to the sufferage movement and those that organized and participated in it.  The story of the suffragette movement is still real and has meaning today not just in gender equality but in many other areas including social class.

My 4 star rating is based on what is missing from the film, the ultimate triumph of the movement and it's impact on the characters. Yes the dates that the right to vote was given in Britain and surprisingly much later the United States, were projected however the story abruptly ended for the characters. I wanted more. The characters although well developed were largely two dimensional, even the main character although her circumstances and the impact of those experiences on her led her to become involved in the movement didn't have the depth that they would have certainly been to a woman involved as she was at the time.

I'd be interested in a bigger examination of the class differences between a working class suffragette and the more upper crust Emmeline Pankhurst.  I also felt that more focus should have been on Emily Davis, since ultimately her actions served as the climax of the film but her character was barely seen and not well developed up until the said climax.  Nevertheless Carey Mulligan is her usual amazing self, the pathos she feels when her child is taken from her is visceral and you truly feel her pain.

7536974,5,B017Y01GOM,Movie was obviously slanted toward the suffragette struggles.  But is an eye opener as to the role and attitude towards women at the turn of the 20th Century that we find hard to imagine ever existed  Although Meryl Streep is pictured as a major player in this movie she essentially had a very minor role.  Carey Mulligan is being cast in more substantial roles as she grows as an actor.  Movie was well acted and had a sort of surprising finish if you didn't know the history of the suffragette movement in the UK.  Good movie,1457827200,,527,4.447916666666667

Having Meryl Streep on the cover is a bit misleading. She has few scenes and takes up about 3 minutes of the whole movie. Bonham Carter is likewise a supporting player. The star of the movie doesn't show up until the end, so it's a surprise. So don't draw any conclusion from the cover.",1457827200,,447,4.385542168674699

It left out the best parts of the book (what's the point of only stealing the duller bits?) 2. The ending was terrible. Honestly, where was the climax? The drama? 3. There were key elements that were left out of the movie pertaining to the suffragettes that, unless you knew what was going on from your own background knowledge of the events, you wouldn't really understand.

So disappointed that yet another wonderful book that I've read (trilogy of books really..) was turned into a butchered movie.  Not worth the couple of bucks it costed to rent it. :/",1455667200,3,659,4.483333333333333

7537287,4,B017Y01GOM,"Years ago the BBC did a series SHOULDER TO SHOULDER (1974) that told the story of the origins and development of the Women's Movement in Britain, with special attention paid to the WSPU (Women's Social and Political Union).

Sarah Gavron's film revisits the same territory as it tells the story of the gradual awakening of Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) as she sets her marriage and family aside in favor of the Women's Movement. The crux of the action centers around the death of Emily Wilding Davison (Natalie Press) at the 1913 Derby, as she stepped out in front of the horses finishing the race and was crushed to death.

In view of the film's earnestness of purpose, it seems a shame to criticize it. However there are certain jarring elements that do stand out. Abi Morgan's screenplay seems uncertain whether to focus on the political or the familial elements. Maud's husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) is just too placid a personality to become truly angry about his wife's decision to embrace the Suffagette cause, and the emotional scene where he decides to let his son George (Adam Michael Dodd) to for adoption is straight out of KRAMER VS. KRAMER.

Director Gavron seems too concerned with showing tight close-ups of Mulligan's face as she struggles her way through a dead-end job at the local laundry. Hence we get little sense of the slave-like existence pursued by most working-class women at that time. Meryl Streep, in the cameo of role of Emmeline Pankhurst, simply reprises her Margaret Thatcher turn in THE IRON LADY (2011).

On the other hand, the film does have its moments, especially when Maud goes to the Houses of Parliament and ends up talking about her life in front of David Lloyd George (Adrian Schiller). We get the sense of how much courage it takes to speak up in front of a group of unsympathetic middle-aged men. Helena Bonham Carter is quite surprisingly good as Edith Ellyn, especially in a sequence where she and her co- conspirators plan to blow up a private property constructed for Lloyd George's personal pleasure. The way Edith grinds up the gunpowder reveals her inherent anger at the ways in which women are treated.

The ending is also powerful, as Gavron fades out from the film into faded black-and-white films of Emily Davison's actual funeral taken in 1913. Through this technique we are made aware of the film's importance to an understanding of British social history.",1454803200,2,2411,4.856447688564477

The entire cast was amazing in their acting!  Meryl Streep has a very small cameo role so if you are a big fan of hers this is not a Meryl Streep movie.

7537291,5,B017Y01GOM,"As we struggle and grapple with contemporary inequality issues  race, the economic divide, gay rights, etc  it is well to see this film, reminding us that it has been less than a century since womens rights were recognized and women made equal to men in voting, parental rights (if not economic equality.) and presence in politics and entertainment. Abi Morgans script is excellent as is Sarah Gavrons direction, and with the superlative support of a cast of gifted actors this film breathes reality, memory, and reminders of a status struggle of the fairly recent past.

SUFFRAGETTE tracks the story of the foot soldiers of the early feminist movement, women who were forced underground to pursue a dangerous game of cat and mouse with an increasingly brutal State in England. These women were not primarily from the genteel educated classes; they were working women who had seen peaceful protest achieve nothing. Radicalized and turning to violence as the only route to change, they were willing to lose everything in their fight for equality - their jobs, their homes, their children and their lives. Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) was one such foot soldier. The opposite side of the feminist movement is well presented by Mauds husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw (on of the more gifted actors on the screen today) who provides a degree of bilateral balance, a man who loves his wife and child and simply does not want to see his family endangered by Mauds growing involvement in the movement.

Other brilliant performances are offered by Anne-Marie Duff, Romola Garai, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleason, Natalie Press and Meryl Streep as the queen of the movement Emmeline Pankhurst.

The story of Mauds fight for dignity is as gripping and visceral as any thriller, it is also heart breaking and inspirational. An altogether brilliant film. Grady Harp, February 16",1454716800,3,1862,5.052117263843648

But there is very little in this movie that endears us to the cause-- these women seem somewhat like hollow cartoons (not the funny sort) who act out, sketches of the real women, even in dramatic moments. Alternately, they come off as histrionic terrorists. Even Meryl Streep, who I adore, seemed like a paper doll rather than a character with depth. Where's the passion?

7537334,5,B017Y01GOM,"One film can hardly do justice to the complexities of the suffragette movement, but Suffragette does a good job of highlighting some of the personal struggles that ordinary women such as main protagonist Maud Watts would have endured. Mauds innate sense of justice and morality is the springboard for her initially hesitant involvement in the movement through to her absolute commitment to it. Her trajectory is propelled by our witnessing her husbands repressive attitudes, police brutality, sexual molestation, political hostility and cowardice, and the prejudice of her workmates and neighbours.

Juxtaposed with this is the sense of solidarity and idealism of the suffragette movement. Mauds sisters are kind, compassionate and driven to change the world. This fairly black and white contrast, although simplistic, helps to keep the story moving and ensure our sympathies. The only ambivalent exception is Inspector Steed who as a policeman is determined to thwart the suffragettes but becomes conflicted over their treatment in prison and delivers a timely warning about the dangers of violence. Earlier he warns Maud of the perils she faces by becoming involved in a radical political movement. Emily Davison, who plays such a profound role in the movement, is reduced to a bit part until her devastating moment of protest. This is interpreted and treated as the catalyst for dramatic change and hard fought justice.

The bleak lives of working-class women are effectively evoked and Maud suffers both as a female worker and as a wife. The story is grim and dark, and reminds us that rights and privileges we take for granted, have been fought for by people of enormous courage. It reminds us of the nexus between politics and the media and the power of social conditioning.

This is a fine film depicting a crucial struggle from the early twentieth century. Ultimately, Mauds story of suffering and sacrifice highlights how it is often those who give the most for a cause who do not gain as much as those who follow and reap the benefits of change.",1451001600,13,2055,5.091988130563799

Carey Mulligan is brilliant as working-class mother Maud Watts, drawn into a fight that sees her lose her job, her family and her home.

Director Sarah Gavron & Screenwriter Abi Morgan team to provide what constitutes a bit of making-of background but most of the commentary is the research and knowledge of the real events and people depicted in the film.

Original review:
An unexpected surprise after all the hype that Meryl Streep has limited screen exposure. BUT, the next unexpected surprise, the show is a great historical drama with a story taking place in a period of time when womens suffrage was touching most major countries of the world in a big way. The film is worthy of accolades due to the story, writing, and acting of the remaining cast. It needs to be taken as historic memories, not a modern-day feminist movement, although some of the ideals stressed at the time of the film, 1912-13, remain allusive to many women. If you expect a feminist-activist modern movement, you will be disappointed. If you expect a Streep leading lady, again disappointment. If you go for entertainment brought about through a past era, this film is loaded. Plenty of entertainment and the acting cast is worthy. You see the marching, parades, and banners, but you also get a look at the darker side of the activist drama, the struggles, the imprisonment, feedings, injuries, and abuse. Way more than just a voters right. After all, suffer and suffrage have a common root word.

Streep plays the movements founder Emmeline Pankhurst, but shes in hiding 10 years into the activism. Instead we get a delightful delivery of Carey Mulligan (Bleak House) as Maud Watts, a laundry worker soft spoken with feelings and her colleague Violet (Anne-Marie Duff -Shameless). You get to hiss and boo some fine antagonists in husband Sonny Watts (Ben Whishaw) and the boss (Geoff Bell Silent Scream Scoop), plus a copper (Brendon Gleeson -Beowulf Braveheart). Expect the men to be bad guys, it is what the movement was all about, so the film is true to the times, without being overly 21st century feminist.

Some great cinematography. There is an inclusion of a real 1913 event at a race track, which has never been proven as to purpose. It is a century-plus past story and the cast and crew have done an excellent job of providing characters and their individual threads enough to entertain while giving an overview of the centennial period. Its a story of struggle that could easily fit other minority or cast groups.
Entertainment with emotion.",1448409600,70,3177,4.934579439252336
7537337,3,B017Y01GOM,"The British women who fought for voting rights in the early 20th century wouldn't recognize the listless, passionless versions of themselves seen in Suffragette. Starring Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, and Meryl Streep, there are a number of powerful actresses who could easily embody the fire burning within the women who risked all to gain the right to vote, and yet the mediocrity of the screenplay gives them all little to work with. The film certainly gives the impression of being about something important, but never captures the emotion necessary to be stirring in any way.

While there are a handful of real-life women depicted in Suffragette, such as lead rabble-rouser Emmeline Pankhurst (Streep) and Emily Wilding Davison (Natalie Press), the rest are purely fictional. This isn't a big deal; the degradation and violent oppression the protesters faced is a thing of fact, and these stories surely happened to some of them. It's just that there isn't anything especially memorable about Suffragette despite its heavy tones and bleak atmosphere. This is a film so heavy on message that it forgets to tell the kind of rousing story it hopes to be.

Mulligan grimaces her way through the role of Maud, a regular, blue-collar laundress who just wants to stay out of the suffrage crossfire. And who can blame her when women are being beaten up in the streets, thrown into jail, and fired from their jobs just for demanding voting rights. It gets even worse at home as husbands have full authority over their wives, threatening to leave them destitute and alone if they join the political movement. The abuse is just as bad at work, and when Maud attends a hearing on it she's compelled to give testimony when her friend Violet (Anne-Marie Duff) is badly beaten. The experience sets Maud on a course to join the brick-throwing militants ready to wage war on the men keeping them from their rights to vote.

On the other side of the fight is...well, every single guy in the film. Maud's husband (Ben Whishaw) is doomed to be a jerk the moment he first warns her not to get mixed up with the suffragettes. It only gets worse as she's frequently arrested and interrogated by the film's chief villain, Inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson), whose chief job seems to be enduring a fuselage of feminist catchphrases;  ""Were half the human race. You cant stop us all""! But catchphrases and slogans are all usually-reliable screenwriter Abi Morgan has to offer. Her trite, unremarkable screenplay undersells Maud's transformation from quiet observer to someone willing to blow up houses to make her point. As the suffragettes' tactics take on a more threatening tone, Morgan and Gavron go out of their way to keep the women sympathetic rather than allowing audiences to decide for themselves. Some of the actions taken by the suffragettes were indeed terrible and caused harm to others, but the film barely stops long enough to examine their part in the escalating violence.

Only Duff's character Violet is depicted with any complexity but she's also one of the few with the least screen time. That said; she more than quadruples what Meryl Streep gets as Pankhurst. Sure, Streep is plastered all over the promos but she gets literally one scene in which she delivers a hammy speech and jets off to parts-unknown. She'll probably get an Oscar nomination for it, anyway.  Mulligan would be the most deserving actress, though, as she injects far more humanity into the role of Maud than the screenplay provides. She has some terrific scenes in which she's faced with a decision between her family and her convictions. In the film's best moment we see a glimmer of hope in her eyes at just the thought of women gaining the right to vote, something she had never even considered to be possible.

Unfortunately, Morgan's screenplay doesn't connect the dots between the suffragettes' fight and the victory they would achieve years later. It dulls the crowd-pleasing affects of an undeniably powerful and important story about the seismic social and political shifts these women sacrificed everything for.",1448409600,37,4100,4.976642335766424
7537338,4,B017Y01GOM,"""Suffragette"" (2015 release from the UK; 106 min.) brings the story of how a group of women in the early 20th century used civil disobedience to try and obtain voting rights for women in the UK, As the movie opens, we get to know Maud Watts (played by Carey Mulligan), a 24 yr. old woman working in the Glasshouse Laundry in London. Working conditions are brutal. By chance, Maud needs to deliver a package on Oxford Street and gets tangled up in a group of women demonstrators, smashing store windows while demanding ""Votes for Women"". Maud  recognizes one of her co-workers and this is the beginning of her involvement with the 'suffragettes"". To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Sarah Gavron, who previously brought us the excellent ""Brick Lane"" (2007). Here Gavron tackles the women's right to vote movement (working on a script from Abi Morgan, who also wrote Brick Lane, and later The Iron lady). The movie's production set takes us back 100 years or thereabout, and that era's London is brought to life in exquisite detail (including scenes filmed in the House of Parliament itself, for the very time). While this is a noble cause, regretfully the movie  is flawed as the characters are too one-dimensional (men: BAD!!, women: angels!), and we simply do not get emotionally invested in them. The Maud Watts character goes from bad to worse, and her young son comments at some point after Watts has been arrested again ""Have you done something very bad, mama?"". That the movie falls short certainly isn't for a lack of trying on Carey Mulligan's part, who almost wills the movie to be good on her very shoulders. Helena Bonham Carter plays another noticeable fictional character. Meryl Streep, who plays the real-life Emmeline Pankhurst (leader of the suffragettes), is in all of one scene, addressing a crowd, totaling less than 5 minutes of screen time. And am I the only one who had trouble at times understanding the English accent of the movie's performers? There were entire lines that went over my head as I couldn't make heads or tails of it. On the other hand, veteran composer Alexandre Desplat, who earlier this year finally won his first Oscar for Best Movie Soundtrack (for ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") delivers yet another outstanding score. That guy is money. Bottom line: the women's right to vote movement is a very noble cause, no question about it, but this movie, however well-intended, falls short on several levels, unfortunately.

""Suffragette"" recently opened on a couple of screens here in Cincinnati, and the evening screening where I saw this at this weekend was attended nicely (mostly by seniors, I might add). The movie has been beset by many indifferent, if not negative, reviews from the so-called critics and experts. It didn't stop me from checking it out, but I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the movie overall. Still I urge you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1448064000,3,3145,4.840148698884758
7537339,4,B017Y01GOM,"Directed by Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane, This Little Life) from a screenplay by Abi Morgan (Shame, The Iron Lady), Suffragette is a fairly compelling look at a period of history that is usually given short shrift in the history books, the Women's Suffrage movement of the early 1900's, specifically in this case the movement as it took place in the UK.

Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) is a young woman who works, along with her husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) in an industrial laundry in London. Not remotely political or activist, her life consists of her work, her husband and their young son George (Adam Michael Dodd). Or at least it does until she unexpectedly gets caught up in a suffragette riot one day while delivering a package, where she spots a friend of hers from the laundry, a woman named Violet (Anne-Marie Duff), who is apparently one of the suffragettes agitating for the right to vote.  Gradually, events draw Maud step by step into the movement as she begins to see what these women are fighting for and how it matters. Her increasing involvement brings her into contact with other British women from all walks of life, including a pharmacist's wife, Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter) who knows as much if not more than her husband about medicine, a teacher, Emily Davison (Natalie Press), an MP's wife, Alice Haughton (Romola Garai), and eventually, the formidable leader of the British women's suffrage movement, Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep). She also frequently encounters a police inspector (Brendan Gleeson) whose job it is to maintain surveillance on the women in the movement and to harass and disrupt their efforts on the government's behalf.

The film is not without its flaws.  For one thing, it doesn't provide much background or context of the women's suffrage movement in the UK prior to the point at which the film begins, around 1912. You have to kind of fill things in as you go, but even though the film is quite effective at showing just how limited women's legal rights were at the time and how formidable the opposition - both political and cultural - they faced was, you're still left trying to extend the picture to the country as a whole beyond the limited snapshot the film provides you with. For another thing, it feels unbalanced in how the story plays out as one of the most important - and actually historical - characters gets introduced fairly late into the film and we don't get to really know her before she ends up playing the role in events that were pivotal in both the film and in real life. I can't say more without possibly giving a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the film would have been better if her character had appeared earlier and been worked more integrally into the overall story.

Also worth noting is the superb attention to detail by production designer Alice Normington (Great Expectations, The Woman in White), cinematographer Eduard Grau (The Gift, Buried, A Single Man) and costume designer Jane Petrie (Moon, Is Anybody There?), who together really brought the look and feel of the British Suffragette era to life on the screen.  And the musical score by Alexandre Desplat (The Imitation Game, The King's Speech) was seamlessly woven in, enhancing the mood of the scenes without distracting from what was happening in the film.  High quality all around.

Highly recommended for it's portrayal of the conditions and circumstances women had to face before winning the vote and how intense that struggle was, and for a number of fine performances.",1447804800,23,3516,4.858096828046745
