8298212,4,B001EHDSUW,"******Maria Bramfords special sense of humor and Lynns edge of nasty girlfriend is so great, I have a great laugh every time I watch these two artists, that is the whole Idea , right ? Funny is the key word here, that is just my opinion, there are some that might very well enjoy the other comedians on the DVD.....they are OK but the other two, buy this just for those two comedians I mentioned, you will not be sorry.
I have shelves full of my favorite comedians, now I have one more, well worth it !

8298214,2,B001EHDSUW,"First off these comediennes are all very funny and I recommend everyone see them at some point, you might not like them all, but that's comedy.  My dislike is with the production and my problems are as follows:
1. Swear words are bleeped, and considering the very adult subjects that are covered, bleeping a few words makes NO SENSE and just ruins a bunch of punchlines.
2. The camera work is terrible, the camera views are constantly changing for no reason and the closeup angle for Maria Bamford leaves her mouth completely obscured by the microphone (unsettling when she's doing her voices).
3. There are camera fade-outs or cuts to the Comedy Central title frequently and for no reason.  It just interrupts the flow.
4. The audience sounds like trained seals and often unenthusiastic, this ruins the mood.  I was often wondering if their response was muted (when funny jokes get no laughs) or if canned laughter was added (some of the applause sounds fake).
5. I've heard a lot of the same material from these artists before, and I haven't seen any of them more than a couple of times before.
These 5 women are all very funny, this disc is just not the place to see them.",1295222400,,1175,4.6124401913875595
