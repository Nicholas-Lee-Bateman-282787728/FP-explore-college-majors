In addition the menu covers the licks in groups, so you have to access the group and fast forward as opposed to just going to lick 29, for instance. No theory to speak of. It would have been nice if he had gone into guide tones or a bit of how the lick was constructed around the chord or progression. The piano backup is almost inaudible. I don't know why they didn't master it so you could hear better what the lick sounds like against harmony. On the plus side, he can play. And I do like his method. Most tapes are ""here it is fast, here it is slow, go refer to the book."" He goes into the lick very slowly for a couple of notes, explains exactly where they are, then as he adds notes he goes back and plays the lick from the beginning so you are adding on to it instead of just seeing a bunch of notes in a row. In reality, you are not going to memorize fifty licks. If you get four or five and divide it into the price plus shipping, it's an expensive way to go. You can get more out of you tube free. I'd have rather seen ten licks and the thought process behind them and possible variations than fifty I'm not going to use. I can't really recommend it.",1320969600,,1288,4.03515625
8148320,1,B000J10HB2,"I haven't been very impressed with this so far.  There are a lot of licks on this CD.  However, it does not come with any booklet, so you don't get any tab, (or note), documentation of the licks.  This makes learning very difficult because you have to watch very closely, and try to remember all the fingerings as he is rattling them off.  This also means you don't have anything written to go back to for review later.  I'm sure the intention is for the student to take notes, but that is a bit difficult while holding a guitar, trying to control the DVD, and actually play the lick after seeing it.  (And some of these licks are quite long.)  It would be MUCH better if there was a booklet with it that contained the licks in tab.

I'm only about half way through it, but I also didn't get a lot of theory, or progression help out of it either.  It's basically, ""Here's a lick you can play over C7...""  But no instruction as to what type of progression that C7 might be found in.  This makes it even more difficult to recall the lick.  It would help if there was some instruction on playing the licks in progressions.  (Make music, not licks....)

If you asked me, I would suggest getting Sid Jacob's Jazz Improvisation DVD instead.",1209859200,,1234,4.355263157894737
