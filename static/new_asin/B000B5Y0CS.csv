2401000,5,B000B5Y0CS,"`Cannibal Holocaust' is widely regarded as one of the most intense, affecting horror films ever, at least amongst the sorta viewer who would actually have seen this movie.  I'd agree with this assessment.  This film seems slightly less well known than `Cannibal Ferox', though I can't imagine why.  On top of being far better made, it's a lot more outrageous and offensive as well.  So, if you've seen that film, and weren't particularly impressed, don't just ignore `Cannibal Holocaust'.  Certainly, it's still got many of the flaws that come with low-budget horror film making, mostly being that the acting is often pretty amateurish and the dialogue fairly blas.  But, as H.G. Lewis said, no one ever walked out of `Blood Feast' because the police investigator couldn't act, and I think the same can be said of the guide or professor or whoever in `Cannibal Holocaust'.  And, again, these are standard shortcomings of the genre.  If you can't live with the acting in this movie, you shouldn't be watching this sorta movie in the first place.  But, if you do like this kinda thing, `Cannibal Holocaust is about as good as it gets.

Now, lotsa cheap horror films are fun to watch: They have cool gore or nice atmosphere or camerawork or whatever.  But few are really all that powerful or intense.  `Cannibal Holocaust' is, partially because of how it is structured.  The film concerns the investigation into the disappearance of 4 documentary filmmakers down in South America.  This allows for a sort of dual narrative, as we watch a professor and some others go search for them, then, and find that they're dead, but that their film reels survived, and so we watch them during the second half of the movie. This provides an interesting contrast, as the first half of the film is shot pretty as any film of this sort would be shot.  It's well done, by the standards of this sort of thing, but not remarkable.  But, the second half of the movie, specifically the film within the film, is shot in a very rough, pseudo-documentary style.  The transition from the traditional filmmaking style to the mock-documentary is very effective, as the contrast heightens the relative realism of the tape.  Of course, the documentary isn't terribly realistic, if you think about it all that much, as the acting is still questionable at times (though definitely better than the rest of the film) and it's all kinda theatrically amateurish, but it still tends to feel very realistic at the time anyway.  Though, getting back to that, I actually think the acting by Yates' team is pretty good.  Yeah, it's kinda hammy, but it fits their personalities.  They've got a totally destructive and adolescent mindset going into the jungle, so their yelling and pranking all actually makes quite a bit of sense.

I can't precisely say what the appeal of this film is.  With most gory horror films, I just kinda gawk at the  extremity and ingenuity of the violence and the gore fx.  As far as I can tell, there is nothing of real world violence in it.  But, this is different.  `Cannibal Holocaust' addresses violence in a more visceral sense, and it's not a fun movie, but it's got an undeniable appeal.  The violence is often more about the violence itself, rather than just the gore, emphasizing the cruelty and brutality of the aggressor. (Most clearly displayed in how they callously hack off their guides leg when he gets bit by a snake, more interested in documenting it then helping him, and how the crew dances around and celebrates as they decimate the Yakumo village, and later how the Yanonamo just continue to hack away at their dismembered corpses, on and on. etc.)  What can I say, it's just got a real gruesome intensity that makes it unsettling and yet compelling.  Occasionally, I'd say it goes slightly too far, such as the rape scenes that seem to go on forever, and the forced abortion scene, which I really could've lived without.

Some people argue that these cannibal films aren't horror movies, and while it may vary on a film to film basis, `Cannibal Holocaust' is definitely a horror film.  There is no adventure in the various treks through the jungle, just horror and death.  And it just does a brilliant job of building things up and up, with ever increasing horrors throughout the film within the film.  And the climax puts it all together perfectly, with the wild, amateurish camerawork and frantic pacing.  The gore effects aren't up to modern standards, but they're extremely good for the time, and are surprisingly convincing.  There is quite a bit of animal violence in this film, so if that bothers you ya oughta stay away.  I don't find this kinda thing morally offensive, though it can be pretty nasty, particularly the killing and dismembering of a turtle, which is pretty much the grossest thing, ever.  Also, there's is a *lot* of sexual violence, so if that bothers you too much, you'll need to steer clear.  Suffice to say, if you've ever been offended by any violent movie, you probably oughta give this a pass.

The score is perhaps slightly overbearing, but it's very memorable and quite powerful.  Definitely heightens the impact of the more graphic scenes.

This film is not yet released in Region 1, but Grindhouse is supposed to be putting it out in late October.  This may yet be delayed, however, as a couple companies have refused to print it due to the offensive artwork.  (Presumably, it's the naked, impaled native chick that's on the cover which is making them balk.  And, of course, the guys over at Grindhouse are crying censorship, and claiming the cover is 'banned', which is bullcrap.  They're aren't preventing the DVD from being produced, they're just refusing to help.  Claiming that is censorship is like claiming that your censoring a graffitti artist if you refuse to let him spray paint all over your house.  Of course, they're also claiming this is the  'most controversial film ever' which is ridiculous, so maybe they're just trying to be showmen and hype this up as much as possible.  But, whatever)  Anyway, I doubt it'll be too long, and that version is doubtless going to be the best one in any Region.  Personally, I have the Region 0 EC Entertainment version, and it looks pretty good, but I'm sure the Grindhouse one will top it in all areas.

Worthy of its reputation.  I'm done.

2401040,4,B000B5Y0CS,"This film is like no other. It was made in 1979, when real depictions of violence and sex were in vogue. I watched in three parts, mainly because some scenes were too upsetting and couldn't go on. I gave it another chance each time, because I believed I had to finish it (first and last time I will!) so I could understand what the director's message or intention was. It was a visceral, brutal, graphic, and disturbing film. I understood that was the intention of it. The depictions of violence looked very authentic. I really wished the animal violence wouldn't have been real. In conclusion, this movie is a must if you're a horror fan, film scholar, or thrill seeker. It's not a film to love or hate. It's a roller coaster of human, basic emotions.  Like a haunted attraction. (Spoiler) At the end, there was a social commentary moment, when one of the main characters asks himself: ""Who are the real cannibals here?""",1515024000,,921,4.615853658536586

2401062,1,B000B5Y0CS,"When this movie was originally released 35 years ago or so, it was definitely a shocker.  The passage of time has a way of reducing the impact of movies like this.

More than anything, the music just wrecks this movie for me.  It's designed to make you feel sad and that you're witnessing something beyond horrible.  Granted, the subject matter is pretty gruesome, but have to say, when the journalists get butchered at the end, I was cheering.

I also don't get the supposed animal cruelty that a lot of people seem to be crying about.  Yes, the animal killings are real, but I didn't see any instances of cruelty, unless you count the execution itself as being cruel.  One could easily argue that modern methods of meat processing are probably more cruel.  If you haven't ever seen an animal being butchered, then yes, it can be a bit of a shock, especially when there's some sad, sappy soundtrack slapped over it.

The premise of the movie is pretty absurd in my mind also.  What kind idiots would wander off into the jungle with only a rifle or two and commit the atrocious acts as these moron journalists do?  For me, the rape scenes were the hardest to watch.

The real travesty of this film, and I hate to jump on the bandwagon, is the exploitation of the indigenous people in it.  Regardless of the point of the movie, we the Cro-Magnon people are a savage lot.  It doesn't matter if we have a cell phone or just a stick in our hands.  Take the blinders off and you'll see constant, repeated reminders of just how brutal and savage we are across all cultures.

If you haven't seen this film, I suppose it's worth a viewing, just because, but don't expect anything great.  Even by the standards of its own time, it wasn't all that great.",1492560000,2,1744,4.468354430379747

Prepared for the not so good graphics being a 80s movie i was suprised to see its not as bad as i thought. But what little story there is is completely unbelieveable. *SPOILER AHEAD*

With pretty much only animal deaths (which were completely real ) and lots of rapes, all the deaths pretty much happened in the last 15 mins of the movie. And where it got ruined and turned 100% unrealistic, your telling me you see your friend (s) get taken and follow only to hide in the bushes and watch them be killed and or raped and you do nothing? No trying to help or no running away yourself?

Glad i saw this so now i know but i could definitely have lived without it. Green Inferno was much better of a movie than this junk. At least that had a story to it and made me laugh a few times.",1489968000,,884,4.074712643678161

If you like film as an art, look elsewhere.  This is just garbage.",1489968000,3,372,4.333333333333333
2401066,4,B000B5Y0CS,"I heard about this movie years ago and finally decided to watch because I felt drawn to watch it later in life.  While some elements of the music were distracting (string instruments and electronic sound effects mixed together) I learned from the story line.  We could all be those characters who traveled to see new places and new people.  But SPOILERS...the guide of the cast died and they were armed with little more than a flare gun and a compass.  The killing of the animals for food on camera was important.  (I see that now.)  It was foreshadowing.  I covered my eyes at some parts and don't think I missed anything crucial.

The natives seemed so innocent and the cast (young adults) were so disrespectful.  It was so easy to criticize their violent behavior, but how often are we indifferent or even uncaring about those who differ from us?  Example:  a woman went off to die alone due to a skin disease.  They recorded everything offering her no privacy or dignity.  They did the usual things people do in new lands:  gun toting and raping.  The only time they tried to do the right thing (in their eyes) is save a woman from ""social surgery.""  (She was being punished for unknown reasons and they tried to intervene with no success.)  But again, this was interfering with the native culture--not okay.  It ends as these situations usually do:  an uprising.  The natives fight back and we see our naive, foolish cast die one by one, just like the turtle and muskrat.  And you do wonder, just who were the cannibals in the story?",1488412800,2,1538,4.580882352941177

2401070,1,B000B5Y0CS,"Being a fan of horror, Cannibal Holocaust has been somewhat of a nuisance in the back of my mind. Ive always heard about the animal cruelty within this film and for a long its the reason why I never watched it. Because this film is mentioned over and over again by people such as Eli Roth and Rob Zombie, I decided to at least give this film a shot.

After finally watching Cannibal Holocaust I can finally see now that this is a poorly made exploitation film that is only known all these years later because of the animal cruelty and also the excessive rape scenes.

Cannibal Holocaust surprisingly has an amazing idea and plot that sadly was thought up by a man with apparently zero imagination and talent. The film begins with a professor working with a rescue team to find a group of filmmakers. Upon discovering they're dead, his mission then becomes to retrieve the footage they shot which he then brings back to America to be viewed.

Pretty great idea when you consider how lazy and mediocre the plots of other found footage films are.

Sadly this idea is used within a film that is the sleaziest and laziest possible version of exploitation. Not only is this a horrible film, its perhaps the very first found footage film so it would go on to inspire one of the very worst sub-genres in horror.

The terrible acting combined with the Italians guessing at how Americans speak make this film all the more unbearable. The woman in the documentary crew seems to be the very worst of the actors and has also been given the worst and cheesiest of lines which makes for a combination that even Ed Wood would edit out of his films.

If you were to take the excessive rape scenes and animal cruelty out of Cannibal Holocaust, you would be left with one of the most boring films imaginable. This really is the kind of movie that only a very edgy teenager in middle school or high school would ever think is worth their time.
Cannibal Holocaust becoming such a cult classic is somewhat infuriating since it seems to have been loved and admired by a group far too intelligent to like a film that is so poor in quality and uses repetitive rape scenes and real life animal cruelty to keep viewers not only distracted but awake.

At this rate, you might as well take the security camera footage of Sandy Hook and add a synthesizer film score to it.
Overall, Cannibal Holocaust is a film that goes to the most extreme in order to distract you from very poor filmmaking. If you need a film that is shocking and still makes viewers uncomfortable, Salo or The 120 Days of Sodom is a film that is similar to Cannibal Holocaust but with a quality and sense of direction.",1485475200,2,2658,4.479338842975206

2401115,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Yes, this film is every bit as brutal and controversial as youd expectbut its also a brilliantly made, stylistic film thats way ahead of its time and addresses important aspects of morality.

After a delightfully polite warning from Shudder this Italian cult classic opens with a lovely scored montage of shaky shots of the Amazon, known by its indigenous inhabitants as the Green Inferno (hence Eli Roths title Green Inferno).

Alan Yates, Faye Daniels, Jack Anders and Mark had embarked on an expedition to the border of Brazil and Peru to document the jungle tribes.  They followed in the footsteps of explorers who never came back, but they laughed at the amateurs.  After this new group failed to return within two months, a rescue mission was set up to recover them.

Our anthropologist rescuer Dr. Monroe teams up with a local roughneck guide and follows the same path as his predecessors marked by the decaying corpse of another jungle guide and Fayes lighter worn as a charm by a tribesman.

Very early scenes of military machine-gunning through forest natives is campy and bloodless such that youd think you were watching some PG-13 nonsense.  But don't be fooled so soon.  Not that I expect a lot of animal lovers to watch this, but you should be warned that real live animals are killed on filmand not even close to mercifully.  I felt so badly for that muskrat (about the 19 min mark).  Later in the film there is an even more disturbing scene involving decapitating a large turtle and then preparing its still-twitching body.  Just brutal, from prying the shell apart to sloppily yanking out its guts.

This brutality makes its way to humans as a woman is dragged across the mud completely naked and bound, and forced into some shockingly uncomfortable positions during a sort of torturous rape scene complete with vile genital mutilation.  The violence against women in this film is immense.  But then, so is the general inhumanity overall.

[BLOCK] In the past Ive praised some actresses for what they physically endure on film: Jo Beth Williams (Poltergeist), Jenny Spain (Deadgirl), Isabelle Adjani (Possession), Elma Begovic (Bite), Linda Blair (The Exorcist), the entire cast of The Descent, Monica Belluci (Irreversible), the women of Martyrs, Charlotte Gainsbourg (Antichrist, Nymphomaniac), Alison Lohman (Drag Me to Hell), Danielle Harris (Halloween), Caroline Williams (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), Jane Levy (Evil Dead), the cast of The Human Centipede films, and all actresses from the I Spit on Your Grave films, the women of all other TCM old and new, and Last House on the Left films/remakes/sequels.  Clearly Cannibal Holocaust must now be added to this list.

This film features abundant male and female full frontal nudity, rape and torture, horrible brutality against women and animals, and cannibalism.  It seems that if you are capable of being offended by anything, then this film will have something in it to offend you!  And this all happens in the first 30 minutes!!!

But wait, what ever happened to the original crew of documentarians?  Well, Monroe (and we) get to see their recovered video footage.  Speaking of which, was this (most of the second half anyway) one of the original found footage movies?

Whats really interesting about this stylistic film is that its so far ahead of its time.  We see footage from the original documentary crew, then half the movie follows Monroes rescue mission and interactions with the tribal people (a mix of normal and docu-reels), and then return to civilization and see the recovered found footage (both as footage and as regular scenes) with Monroes reactions to them for the second half of the film.

When we consider the title, we imagine that wed have sympathy for the lost crew and whatever horrible fate had befallen them.  But it turns out they may have very well earned their undoing.

The gore is perhaps a bit more authentic than were used to, apparently consisting largely of whole animal organs in lieu of the standard rubber guts popularized by Romeros original Zombie Trilogy, the actual brutal executions of some animals (the turtle scene was the worst), and various rape, birth and amputation scenes.

As if making a statement of our own acceptance and desensitization to violence and cruelty, disarmingly pleasant music often scores scenes of cruelty and mayhem.  Monroe calls the original crew out for their inhumanly soulless actions and the target of our sympathy shifts dramatically.

This film has a reputation for being brutal and unsightly.  I guess it is, and it especially was for 1980. But how had I never heard of how stylish and unique and ultimately self-realizingly moral it was?  This movie is reallywellgreat.  Great in a very non-mainstream, socially unacceptable kind of way, to some. But great, nonetheless!  I think this film is excellent!",1470528000,8,4863,5.01494396014944

(Viewer Warning! This DVD does have actual animal deaths! 2nd disc is just special features their is no edited version of this film!)

Start of the film Professor Harold Monroe is sent to find a missing team who were doing documentary on cannibal tribes. Monroe see's how cruel and brutal living in rainforest is. When they find remains of the team along with their camera and footage they bring it back to New York where Alan the director working with executives of the Pan American Broadcasting System want to air their footage live. However as Monroe see's what Alan and his team does and treating the tribe's people cruel he is degusted and sickened by it. The executives still wish to air the footage as Monroe has them watch the rest of the footage and after it's over the executives order all footage to be destroyed.

So in the end the team that went missing in rainforest got that they desired for being careless jackasses! I wish Alan that prick got a more painful death for being such a dick!

Like I said the start of the movie is good until it the ending comes and I wondered what kind of person hires a bunch of pricks to go and make a documentary only for them to do whatever they want and being rich from it? The boss of this PABS is a real cold hearted bitch! The more graphic and shocking the footage the higher the ratings will be. Which is how today's news stations work the more tragic and shocking the footage is the more views they gain.

And lastly their are real animal deaths as I couldn't bare to watch them. Also their is some footages of executions from dictator Idi Amin of people being tied up then shot. One of the more graphic scenes is a young boy getting shot as blood splatters both front and out of the boy's body. I think director Ruggero Deodato went over board with this film. If he had a bigger budget to work with he could have avoided using real animals which he regrets now and giving more into the story I think Cannibal Holocaust could have been a better film. But it's not for everyone so choice wisely before watching this.",1467849600,3,2223,4.399026763990268

Holocaust was very realistic but it was not as gory as I was expecting it to be.  The animal killings were the most nauseating and not necessary.  The thru the trees affect that is used while the natives are chowing down was very effective and did add to the realism, the gore that there is is well done.  I'm sure many people view this film out of sheer curiosity as so much has been said about it.  I cant say that I liked the film it just is hence the 3 stars; it's that kind of a film.  I don't see it as an entertainment film myself as much as a pseudo documentary.  It did not have the cheap look that I was expecting to see.

The ""found footage"" approach was quite fresh and effective in 1980. The moral question of: ""Who are the true cannibals?- The tree people? The Journalists? The viewers?""- was a direct strike at modern man as modern savage. The (human on human) violence and gore are extreme, but necessary to the narrative. The infamous animal cruelty in this film is nauseating, due to its being as absolutely real as it is unnecessary. As for the rest, this movie is meant to be shocking, as well as shaming to our rancid, media-obsessed world. Should HOLOCAUST be seen by granny or the kids? Hell no, unless shown to them by a sadistic psychopath! A disgusting, disturbing masterpiece that I'll not be watching again, anytime soon...",1453075200,,887,5.082191780821918
2401168,1,B000B5Y0CS,"I had heard about this film from my gore buddies here on Amazon for many years and being a fan of horror films I was always curious. Im not a gore hound by any stretch, but I can take the sick and twisted as good as anyone so I decided to find out what all the fuss was about.

Im not going to spend a lot of time on this worthless piece of garbage so let me say this film is no where near as horrific as it is famous for. The most disturbing parts of the film feature real animal killings which I certainly found disturbing as any normal human being would. If you like watching defenseless creatures being killed this film may be for you, but please know if you do your money would be better spent on medical treatment.

The movie itself is a complete bore with the crudest of unconvincing effects Ive seen in a movie in a long time. There are a few graphic rape scenes (by graphic I mean full frontal nudity both male and female) which would normally be disturbing, but because we do not care about the people in this film and the sheer lack of any knowledge on how to make a good film, these scenes are just oddly curious.

The human killings, well Ive seen much worse in mainstream movies, an early killing shows a woman being cut down the middle of her torso, sounds horrible right?, well no not when it is obviously just a very dull prop sawing back and forth across a spatter of red paint with no incision ever occurring. I actually laughed at how unconvincing this looked.

There is another scene where we find a woman who is hanging from a long pole with one end coming out of her mouth and the other end coming out of her ..well you get the picture, Right? (think Shish-Kabob and youve got it)  It just doesnt resonate with the viewer at all. I thought it looked very cheap. I wouldnt say this wouldnt disturb some people, but like I mentioned earlier I have seen scenes in mainstream films that were a zillion times worse. (Just take a look at Bone Tomahawk or Nurse Betty for two very different but effective murders to see how it is done right if you want disturbing.)

So now weve tortured ourselves for about an hour and twenty minutes to get to the grand finale which I will admit was the most convincing part of the film. This part of the film uses designed camouflaged to help the crude effects seem like real carnage.  The music is odd, but haunting as the natives go ape sh#% on the last surviving reporters who we care nothing about.  In fact I was happy to see them get theres considering they killed a defenseless animal or two during their journey.

I guess if I was to find any redeeming quality about this film it would be that it is thought provoking that the ""civilized"" humans behavior was even more disturbing than the natives.

Still overall, this film pretty much sucks, its overhyped infamy has now been laid to rest. Long live Cannibal Holocaust? I think not!",1452556800,2,2893,4.33086876155268

It's no doubt a snuff film. But at the same time it sends some pretty interesting messages, and makes the viewer think. Again, my number one biggest problem with this movie is the animal killings. I am not happy about this.

Setting that aside though, the movie itself has a very interesting thing going on. So these 'civil' people go to 'document' cannibal tribes in the Amazon.

Only instead of documenting them, they burn down their huts, kill several of them, and even take it as far as raping one of the tribe women, and impaling her. Even laughing about it.

The movie really makes the viewer ponder...just how civilized are we? This movie showed 'civil' people acting just as animal like as the cannibals.

Sure we wear clothes, we eat brightly colored snacks, we watch TV, we use computers and we keep clean every day. We have hospitals, police stations, office buildings, and all of this.

But despite this...just how civil are we really? The movie asks this question in a very disturbing manner. And well...it is a good question to ask. We're not cavemen anymore, yet we hear in the news every single day of murders, mutilations, rape, animal abuse, etc.

Despite the film's severe controversy, and real animal killings (Which i am not happy with at all) the movie does ask some very good questions about our 'civil' selves, and if we really are all that different from cavemen or cannibals or feral humans. I spent this entire movie not sure who to root for. The humans or the cannibals?

Truth be told, I found myself more horrified at what the 'civil' humans did than what the cannibals did. And that's quite strange and interesting.

Is it for you? Well....it depends. If you're looking for a VERY gory movie that will also make you think and question things, yea it can be pretty entertaining.

If you can't stomach watching people eat other people, rape scenes and REAL animal killings, stay away from this film. I can assure you the animal killings were REAL. No special effects. I can also let you know, this movie is banned in 50 countries. It was seized by the law in fact, ten days after its premiere.

Certain scenes were so gruesome with the humans, that the director was arrested and accused of murder. He was able to prove there were no human murders or anything of that nature during filming. However he still faced charges for the animal killings (which I'm glad he did)

So yea, its very obvious from the first 5 minutes of this film why its banned. If you like watching banned films just for the controversy and to study it yourself, yea it can be a fair watch then. But as far as a fun family film? Yea....no.",1447804800,,2859,4.51937984496124

2401213,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Hands down-- one of the most controversial films I have ever watched...not to mention the behind-scenes/on set stories I read about on IMDB under TRIVIA, which I highly recommend reading before watching this film.  For instance, Ruggero Deodato (the film director of Cannibal Holocaust) had the main actors and actresses sign a contract, in which he asked them not to appear publically nor start in any films for a period of one year, in order to give the viewers the impression that they all have been REALLY killed.  Another interesting story has it that, Francesca Ciardi who played Faye Daniels in the film told in an interview that she proposed to her co-star Carl Gabriel Yorke, who played Alan Yates, to have real intercourse in a jungle before the actual filming of their make-belief sex scene.  According to her, Yorke rejected the offer stating that he had a girlfriend back home.  There was a lot of tension between the director and the actors concerning cruel treatment of animals, terrible filming conditions, not being paid on time, and of course human ego, etc.

The DVD contains two discs...one with the film and the second one with extras.  I still haven't seen the extras...but as for the film, it is unrated and presented in the original version.

He is what the legendary film director Sergio Leone wrote to Ruggero Deodato after viewing the film for the first time, and I quote: ""Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that I think you will get in trouble with all the world.""--- and in trouble he did get.

I have no idea why this movie is listed in ""horror"". It is, truly, a sociology movie about humanity. Really. I HATE that animals were abused and badly suffered for the making of this movie, as if that had not happened I could see how this movie should be one of the #1 movies of all time. But, it was made, and we cannot go back and change that. It was an error that the director admitted and apologized for, remorsefully.

I don't know if a better ""nonexploitation exploitation"" movie has ever been made.

I have to thank Grindhouse for releasing THE penultimate version here on Blu ray. I would NEVER have watched it had this package not been released, and especially never would've watched it had I not had the option of skipping the animal exploitation/violence (I still find it ironic that this was supposed to be so much about NOT exploiting other humans, yet they totally exploited poor animals back when they made it, and that no one thought long enough to NOT do it. even with the director's ""apology"", this thought still rings in my head.

That said, EVERY human should see this as long as they are smart enough to realize what's going on here. AND absolutely get the versions that allow you to skip all the animal violence.

2401221,5,B000B5Y0CS,"The best movie in the Italian cannibal genre. A good movie but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece of horror like Pyscho or The Exorcist. It's not scary or suspenseful like Halloween--the best film of the slasher genre.  I personally liked the first half of the movie where the professor journeys to the Amazon to find what happened to the missing documentarians. The second half of the movie consists of the professor looking at the found footage which shows the grisly deaths of the documentarians.  The movie does play on some stereotypes of indians of the Amazon, but they are not the victims in this movie. The documentarians are exploitative of the indians and in a sense this film can be considered a critique of current reality television. Scenes in the film can be hard to watch for those sensitive to gore. I personally think the film went to far in sexual violence. The rape scenes and scenes of sexual violence are exploitative and the parts of the movie I found hard to watch.

2401260,4,B000B5Y0CS,"First the Roman Empire, then the Renaissance, and finally, Cannibal Holocaust. The Italians know how to deliver the goods.

Yeah, there's lots of whining and gnashing of teeth over this monstrosity, and rightly so. It's often hard to watch. Not because of the animal killing; if you grew up on a farm, or ever went hunting, none of what is shown here will come as any surprise, and by the looks of it they had the moral decency to feed what they killed to the actors. And not because of the rape scenes, although they truly do disturb. But violence against women around the world is as pervasive as it is arrogantly dismissed, and yes, we deserve to have artists rub our noses in that fact once in a while. No, what is hard to watch about this movie is that it bares not only the dark heart of humanity, but also our sick fascination with trivializing it. Critics like to point out that this is an original ""found footage"" film that influenced many others, and it does deserve that recognition. The movie does a nice job of portraying the dehumanizing sickness that comes with objectification, and the weirdly concomitant desire ""to be famous"". In this regard, I'd commend this film for being a sort of an original ""selfie"" that is stripped of the banal and shallow self aggrandizement that makes the suburban mall such a hellish locale.

The film is a little rough around the edges, but kudos to the Amazonians who turn in some pretty good work here, considering they're just day players. The sickos out there looking for their sicko thrills will tire of this film quickly. The true seekers of truth and beauty among you will see this for what it is: a grim, relentless tale of Western civilization that haunts us with its despairing love for something that in far too many of us has long been lost and paved over.",1428710400,4,1815,4.564417177914111

2401279,3,B000B5Y0CS,"Finally able to watch this last night. Watched the animal cruelty free version just really can't stomach seeing real animals being killed. The film itself is pretty interesting in a couple of ways. 1st, unless I'm wrong, this could be the very first ""found footage"" movie made. I certainly can't think of a film before this, but I could be wrong.
2nd, the whole idea that these so called documentarist go out to film and learn about these tribes only to raid, rape and torture these people was a interesting twist. In the beginning, you're obviously meant to believe that these 4 film makers met a horrible demise through no fault of their own. That the evil, lost cannibal tribe killed the innocent civilized man for being curious. Of course, once the lost footage is viewed, the truth is revealed. It's the film makers that are the real barbarians. The real evil lies within them and not the tribe. I feel it's the thing that separates this film from your typical grindhouse/exploitation cinema of this kind. It allows it to stand above the rest with a message of sorts.
There are a few gory scenes that are pretty cool. The best being Jack ripped apart and digested. There are a couple of rape scenes as well that are hard to get through.
The Blu Ray comes with a few odd extras. They include a mini poster and the music soundtrack on CD. Both are not something that interest me.

2401338,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Lets get this bit out of the way first.

As I'm sure you are already aware, this is possibly the most notoriously banned movie ever made. It features animal killings in extremely graphic detail and, rightly so, was banned. As a reviewer, I do not condone the use of such acts in film making, but what this brings to the film is quite astonishing in effect.

On with the Review

The violent nature of this film is well documented, and its my belief that overshadows the incredible direction of the film.

It is a film of 2 halves. The first, is the story of a professors search for a group of film makers who were documenting cannibalistic tribes. The search leads the Professor to the jungle, where he meets with a team of trackers who agree to take him to the tribal village where the documentarians were last seen.

This journey sets the tone beautifully, its a well executed insight to the tribes way of life, a brutal, savage and alien world. The direction is wonderful, Deodato, as brutal as his methods were, captures the essence superbly, as beautiful as it is horrific.

Upon reaching the tribal village, the professor discovers the remains of the young film makers and manages to acquire the film canisters containing the footage that the documentarians had shot.

The 2nd half of the film is the reviewing of the footage found by the professor, what ensues is a truly horrific masterpiece of cinema.

The footage shows the story of Alan Yates and his team. as they trek their way, unmercilessly, through the jungle to capture the footage they want at whatever cost.

As they quite unsympathetically brutalize the tribes people to film their reactions, they become almost drunk with power, as they rape, pillage and destroy their way through the tribes village.

Deodato builds these characters so well that you develop a hatred for them, which in turn, makes you cheer on the cannibal tribes to dispose of them. Despite its grotesque nature, the climax is incredibly satisfying.

Credit to the director Like I said at the start of this review, I do not condone the killing of animals for the sake of entertainment. But this is an incredibly well directed picture, the pace of the film keeps you watching till the end. The music is astonishing. In the scene where the film makers are burning the village, the main theme plays, which is a soothing piece of music, quite an irony to nature of the film. It adds so much to the main characters, it makes them seem innocent yet they are the ones who are savage.

Overall This movie excels all expectations, and Deodato made sure of that. Its a gripping story that is well executed. In spite of its obvious disrepute, this is a fantastic horror flick, it shocks, scares and disgusts to an extreme level. If you are a lover of horror, then this is a must Own.",1420070400,,2811,4.633802816901408

2401342,1,B000B5Y0CS,"This movie is not shocking nor is it gruesome. Completely uneventful waste of time. The actors are really bad in this ""film"". Its as if they pulled people off the street and said ""you want to be in a movie today"". Very hard to watch the acting is so bad. Little to no story. Very slow moving. All the hype of gore is a joke. Little happens until the last 20 minutes. And that stuff is not at all shocking. Its all terribly executed and fake looking.

Supposedly in a jungle. Looks more like upstate NY forest to me. First half is really dull. Second half promises to start moving then drags on and on until the end. What you see at the end isn't worth the wait. Its just a stupid movie that never gets going and does not live up to any of its hype. The only thing that looks real are the tribes. They also kill a turtle and a few monkeys which may have been real. Shocking? No. I am sure the tribes actually kill and eat turtles all the time. The turtle scene drags on and is also boring. The most graphic the movie gets and like the movie itself to long and stupid. You kill, cook and eat a turtle. So what? We kill cook and eat cows all the time. It happens more brutal than this, we just don't film it. Grow up folks - your food suffers the same fate.

Simply put - its awful in all respects. The human violence doesn't look real. The ""tribe"" women who are victims of violence quite clearly are not tribes people. They look like American actors made up to look like tribes people. So I assume they did use real tribes somewhere and likely would have been lynched for trying anything with them so Americans or Italians were used for those scenes. Which takes us to how utterly fake this all is. The white folks just wander in and take over. In real life I am sure skilled hunter tribes would have cut that off in about half a second. Hell, they wouldn't have even been able to approach these villages without being spotted miles away by the hunter/gatherers.  After many abuses, most of which are just chasing them around ... the tribes fight back. Its all so stupid looking. I cant imagine 4 white people wandering into a rainforest, finding a Cannibal tribe and then just taking over. Something tells me they would have had blow darts in their neck before they even saw it coming. These are supposedly people who hunt in the jungle like cavemen ... overpwoering a couple of American frat boys surely isn't a challenge.

The people that rant about the animal killings ... please. I bet the pig was dinner as were the monkeys. Its not a snuff film. Its just a bad film. The claims that the director got arrested for making a snuff film is just media hype. No educated/reasonable judge would watch this movie and think it was real. Heck, a half wit wouldnt buy it.

Being an animal lover myself, the film offended me on so many levels, but that is what it's suppose to do.  Francis Coppola filmed an live animal being killed for Apocalypse Now.  Why is he called a genius and Deodato called a savage and a brute for depicting the exact same thing?  Films like this are often dismissed as being pointless trash with no redeeming value whatsoever, but I would debate that stating that the film's realism in depicting human kind's atrocities to races of people we often regard as savage and uncivilized are all too real.

The NC-17 rating is about right as the ""banned"" version contained herein has things that PETA and the film industry would ban today.  Whether they are necessary in the film and how they got the animals is unknown, but there is live animal killings (in some cases needless) in this film with the largest and last one probably the most wasteful.  They could have chosen a different animal, I will not ruin which animal was used but surely there were others to choose from for this shot.

The film sets the stage in the now ""classic"" Blair Witch style, first-person, shooting.  It is an exploration to find lost explorers, being filmed by the second set of explorers - sort of weird, but you will get it when you see it.  The vast amount of extras used, the overall cinematography (if you can get past the audio that does not quite match the mouths) and basic acting are pretty good, given there is no one you will recognize.

The group bonds well and although the first 30 minutes are slow, it builds to what is deserves, which is one of the most disturbing and psychologically frightening aspects of the film.  Keep in mind this is shot over 30 years ago, limited budget, etc.  It would not be approved to be shot today so you are seeing history, albeit banned history.

The special effects are excellent for the time as is the gore factor, and it is not all killing gore.  There are some scenes that will stay with you for the rest of your days and others that mimic most horror films that Americans are numb to these days.

All in all, it is a worthwhile buy, but beware, it is disturbing and NOT for younger viewers, not even 14-16 year olds.  This is not a fictional SLASHER film, it is realism and can have lasting effects on viewers, esp. the animal scenes.",1409788800,,1864,4.431085043988269

2401402,5,B000B5Y0CS,"I first saw Cannibal Holocaust when I was 16 years old and after viewing it, I instinctively wanted to call the police because I felt I was watching an actual murder. I'm 35 years old now and the movie still stands up today as it did then. This being something extraordinarily shocking, disturbing and truly a landmark film and a horror masterpiece. It's a film that is infamous specifically for the torture and death of animals, real animals being filmed savagely and brutalized. I'm here to speak on the new release the three disc special edition Blu-ray brought out by Grindhouse Releasing.

This comes with the soundtrack and a bunch of beautiful and amazing extras. I've owned many versions of this movie but I have to say clearly that this is a perfect Blu-ray disc of perfection. It could not have been refreshed or brought out any better. This was brought out by fans for the fans. This is a film that has always stuck with me and I consider it my second favorite horror film of all time.

It's a movie that is disturbing, not just because of the animals but because of the nature of these persons going into a different set up, a different reality of life and being cruel, mean and foolish. In all honesty this film can be looked at in a different way. The natives are not really the bad guys, it's the white adventurers that are the bad ones.

They humiliate, disturb the way of life and what they experience can be said, they got what they deserved. The old biblical saying you reap what you sow. I have always recommended this movie to diehard lovers of cinema, horror, and true cinema horror. It is not about the torture porn garbage of today but the real horror of the 30's 40's 50's 60's 70's and some of the 80's.

This movie came out at a time when horror was at its greatest. Horror films touched the very audience, not the reality we see today, pretty boy actors playing vampires, silly stupid cell phone signals being lost. This was when you got dirty, you got gritty, and you got the Grindhouse treatment of horror. This was at a time when The Grindhouse movement and the foreign horror came to America.

The video nastys, those that shock. Those films that were banned and this is one of the biggest banned films ever. Movies this day and age cannot even grasp the reality that Cannibal Holocaust was. This came out during a time when you didn't see things like this.

Grindhouse Releasing also offers a plethora of extras that make it a full night's worth of entertainment and the film itself is presented flawlessly in its original aspect ratio. As a matter of fact, this could be considered the first ""found footage"" film, since the majority of the film is spent watching footage ""journalists"" have filmed before the tables are turned on them by the cannibal tribe they are seen controlling. Once watched, never forgotten. I just wish that they didn't use real animals being killed just for the sake of the audience being disgusted. I held back one star because of that fact.

2401429,5,B000B5Y0CS,"I think its a well-known fact that Im a huge horror fan.  But even so, there are many classic horror flicks out there that I have yet to see.  I have to hang my head in shame when I admit CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST was one of those films.  I had heard many things about it over the years, and I even came close to renting it on VHS way back in the daybut something always kept me from seeing it.  Well, thanks to the fine folks at CAV and Grindhouse Releasing, I finally sat down and watched this film on the special edition 3-disc Blu-ray versionand I am happy to report that all of the hype is true:  this is truly a masterpiece of horror cinema!

You might think this movie would be quite dated since it is 30+ years old.  Quite the contrary.  Aside from a couple of old hairstyles and the clothing, this film stands the test of time on many levels.  And from a horror standpoint, it certainly does!  This film is described as the most controversial movie ever made, and for good reason.

The acting in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is excellent, especially when you consider director Ruggero Deodato actually used real indigenous tribes in the Amazon as some of his actors.  Likewise, the story is enthralling and sucks you in right away.  On a side note, this is the first found footage film ever made, which gives it even more notoriety in the horror world.

But the brutal depictions of graphic violence and cannibalism are what truly make this film amazing.  I appreciate good gore and special effects, but WOWthese are truly astonishing!  There is a castration scene that left me gaping in shock, and there are many other visceral aspects that left me speechless.  The films iconic image of the girl impaled on a large spear is what really makes me shudder; it is truly a testament to a talented production crew.

I cannot find a single flaw with this film, however I will say it won't be for everyone.  I would even bet there are horror fans out there that won't want to see it.  I, on the other hand, loved every minute of it, and I wish I had not waited so long to see it.  If you can stomach the brutality, give this film a look for sure.  But be warned:  its been banned in several countries for a reason!  This special edition set arrives on July 1st, so make a note.",1403568000,5,2263,4.358851674641149
2401430,3,B000B5Y0CS,"Minus some scenes, Cannibal Holocaust is actually a pretty good movie. The film was asking a viable point, who are the ""savages""? It is gruesome, it is disturbing, some scenes are difficult to watch. Being a horror fan, I can stomach a lot. However, when a film includes real footage of  animals being slaughtered, the film no longer holds any entertainment value for me. The turtle scene, as well as the muskrat killing scene made me sick. Also, the shooting of the pig with a shotgun was a bit much.  In my opinion, this film is worth a watch, but not something I would watch again.",1402963200,,584,4.5
2401431,5,B000B5Y0CS,"This is the grandfather of ""found footage"" movies.

One of the best horror films ever made, this one centers around a group of pretentious American documentary filmmakers who decide to invade the privacy of a tribe of savages and get what they deserve.

Screw the crybabies who scream animal cruelty. This film should be studied by every horror fan, and this is one remake I'd welcome with open arms. Five stars!",1400976000,3,412,4.788732394366197
2401432,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Okay, first things first. This film is brutal!

It's shocking, gory, violent, depraved, unbearable to watch, sexist, (borderline) racist, vicious, nasty, cruel, mean-spirited, disturbing, grotesque and not for the faint-of-heart! I say that not as some kind of badge-of-honour, but as a genuine warning to those unwary folk who think they've seen everything! This is horror, turned up to the max, and unparalleled in cinema history! Nothing will make your stomach churn more than this film will, for the simple reason that what you see on film really happened!

With that said, if you are a horror film fan, and are prepared to sit through some of the most uncompromising material ever committed to film, then this is the Granddaddy of cannibal horrors. There is no equal!

Five NYU students head out to the Green Inferno, deep in the heart of the Amazonian Jungle. Whilst there, they annoy and distress the locals, cause untold grief, and end-up being cannibalised. Some time later, a noted anthropologist sets out to discover what happens, and soon enough, he discovers the truth of what really occurred, and this is when the nightmare begins!

Simply put, this is one of the most vicious films ever made. With that said, it is also a masterclass of true horror film-making. No other horror film has ever come remotely close to being as horrific and distasteful on the one hand, whilst simultaneously being one of the most intelligent, provocative and downright cool films at the same time!

Many viewers have tried and failed to sit through this film. Do not be upset if you can't stomach it! You aren't the first, and you won't be the last!

As such, I say in no uncertain times, you will almost certanly find some material in this film offensive. Be it the sexism, the racism, and/or the animal-cruelty. And yes, unfortunately, the animal-cruelty is all 100 per-cent real and genuine! Real animals were actually killed as depicted in the film. So bear this in mind, before you purchase this set! If you are remotely squeamish at animal cruelty, then avoid this movie at all costs, as it will push every single morality button you hold, and destroy it!

In spite of all of the violence and cruelty, there is a story, and it's a pretty sophisticated one. (One non-plot-related minor spoiler lies ahead!) The film, as nasty and vile as it is, is all about deception: about what is real and what is not. It deconstructs the whole issue of violence-as-entertainment in a way that no other film has ever come close too. The one possible exception, could be HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. The film deliberately sets you up to fall, because just when you think you've sussed out what is real and what isn't, the film shocks you and twists everything you thought you knew, up on its end.

All of the animal-cruelty is real.

All of the violence to humans, is staged/faked...

...except for one moment in the infamous ""Road To Hell"" footage. In this footage, what you are seeing is genuine war attrocity footage. Those are real people, really being massacred.

It is this deliberate twisting and subversion of what you think is real, and what you think is fake, is what has given CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST its infamous notoriety, for the past 35 years! By the end, you will have been chewed-up and spat-out, and will be suffering one of the biggest WTF moments ever! Even in 2014, you may still regret seeing this film, no matter how cast-iron your stomach is, or how mentally strong you think you are.

This is absolutely NOT for youngsters. It isn't even suitable for most adults!

But for those of you who are willing to push-aside the animal-cruelty issue, there is a genuinely smart and sophisticated story underneath. It's just a case of asking yourself ""Do I want to know what that story is"", and ""Am I prepared to endure what this film throws at me""?

CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST dares to go where few others will. Are you willing to tag-along for the ride?!

Many think they are. Few make it out the other side!

But in a country that raises hundreds of thousands of animals in inhumane conditions and slaughters them for our dining pleasure, worrying about a turtle is a joke. Go visit a chicken or hog farm and then tell me about this one poor turtle. Now, if you are a vegan who wears no leather belts, shoes, or jackets then I respect your honest feelings. Maybe actually seeing the cruelty in the death of any animal will jar people from their complacency and make them realize that Whopper or Big Mac didn't come out of a petri dish in some lab.",1400025600,10,812,4.554794520547945

Well I'm not sure this DVD shown here has the alternate cut versions, one sans animal violence and the other a ""clean"" version minus all the stuff that made this film notorious.

The violence in this film makes SAW look tame and HOSTEL look like a 3 year old's nightmare. I was shocked and horrified despite it's slow pace. It was just brutal from some of the rape sequences to impaling scene, by far animal lovers will probably die watching them dismember the sea turtle. Of all the death in the film, the animals were actually killed on screen including the endangered sea turtle which landed the director a hefty fine.

Overall it's an over-the-top film that has strangely happy music during the most horrible of sequences. I thought I was shocked when they burned the hut down with villagers inside, but that didn't compare to the end. The end was where I began questioning who was really the monster and who was the victims.

DEFINITELY NOT A POPCORN FILM! I recommend watching on an empty stomach, lest you find yourself emptying it later. I think the real terror begins during the end which feels like a documentary gone to hell, when one of the characters screams ""We're screwed!"" Then the bloodshed begins. The only other film I can recall seeing a castration of a human being was I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (2010), this film was the first.

In Cannibal Holocaust , the forest, it is not simply a branch creaking every twenty minutes and a pumpkin hanging from a tree! To frighten people , one has not simply to move the camera in all directions by sounding strong, jerky breaths and showing the faces of frightened actors. The director is not suggestive and goes even outright in pure gore cinema.

I felt nothing for the four people that go off into the jungle & manipulate, stage their own horror & rape the land & people for cinematic value except...they get what they deserve. And rightly so. Ruggero Deodato did a fine job & whether or not u think hes genius or an insane monstrosity, this film is the standard by what ""found footage"" movies are based and made over 30yrs ago, had some captivating ideas & was before its time in making people believe this was real horror, just not on our continent. People don't want real any more & they didn't then, they only think they do. The real horror movies based on true life, such as An American Crime, are the ones that make us believe that Man is the true Boogeyman. Thats why Henry is on most top 10 lists.

To my knowledge the deaths concerning the people in Cannibal Holocaust aren't real- but the ones involving animals *are*.  If I'm wrong about this please correct me.  Some are calling Cannibal Holocaust a mockumentary either based on what others are saying or maybe they simply don't want to believe the nature of a tribe (and the film crew, for that matter) can be as cruel and vicious as the ones portrayed here.  Well surprise surprise- they *are* that cruel!  It's how tribes survive.

If you have a weak stomach when it comes to watching animals die, DO NOT WATCH THIS!
If you dislike rape and think it's wrong, DO NOT WATCH THIS!
If you're easily offended by the sight of blood stains, meat butchering, and private parts being penetrated by objects occurring right before an eventual death, DO NOT WATCH THIS!

The killing of a turtle -while maybe fascinating in some morbid way since I've never actually seen the meat inside a turtles body- is quite disturbing.  Then again I've grown accustomed to watching deer butchered since I live with a family of hunters (and granted it does make me sick on occasion, if the meat smells).  Obviously the message ""No animals were actually harmed during this films recording"" isn't mentioned anywhere, and for good reason- I believe these animal deaths are 100% real.  Chopping off a monkey's head and pretending it's no big deal is really hard to watch, but the one that really bothers me is the baby pig shot to death in the sand.  Was too similar to a puppy for my liking.  I realize as a eat meater, I'm a bit on the hypocritical side since I don't have a problem eating meat, but I *certainly* have a problem watching animals die (especially when they die without any feeling or compassion like the ones in this film).

Anyway, the storyline- a group of Americans attempt to record a documentary about the ruthless and barbaric nature of tribal people.  However, this film crew steps out of line WAY too many times and pretty much deserves what eventually happens to them, in my opinion.  Unbelievable that any human being would actually think it's morally acceptable to act the way the ones in this movie do.  Rape, murder, sex, and... did they really think they could get away with it just because they're outdoors away from the society they grew up with?  The tribal people are actually respectable in comparison.

Of course my 3-star rating is based on two reasons.  One, there's several hard to watch moments concerning the subjects I mention above, and two, there's no actual storyline other than the film crew walking around filming the tribal people go about their daily lives while constantly pressing their luck.  Very selfish and immature to assume they can walk onto other peoples territory and be ignorant towards them without any concern for repercussions.

Anyway, for the sake of curiosity Cannibal Holocaust delivers, but for weak stomachs and those with strong morals?  Strongly recommended to skip it.",1366416000,8,3341,4.848324514991182

Seeing Ruggero Deodatos infamous CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST again has heightened further my respect for the film. Its without doubt the finest film of its genre and one of the few, IMHO, that can withstand severe artistic scrutiny. Am I saying its not an exploitation film? Not in the least. HOLOCAUST is a veritable singularity of contradictions. Through the mouthpiece of a character, the film chastises the ironic barbarism of so-called civilized society, denounces our cultural voyeurism of violence (recall that Nam was in the very recent past when this was made), speaks with enlightened anthropological eloquence  all while feeding the very culture it criticizes with the very content it appears to revile. Irony piles upon irony, contradictions entwine serpentine into a Gordian knot. Beyond the catalog of horrors  some of which cause ME to flinch and look away from the screen, and this is not my first time seeing this film  past the guts and grisliness, there is meat for thinking, food for thought. My writing is starting to coil upon itself just like this movie. But the ouroboros of apparent contradictions that magnify the twist of the tail-devouring serpent of archetypal yore are part of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUSTs transcendence. Its just as much daring arthouse as greedy grindhouse. Its brilliant for the brave viewer willing to plumb its layers. Regarding the film from a creative and technical standpoint, its use of found footage beats Blair Witch to the punch by decades  though the footage has a wraparound story also, lacking in BW but which enriches CH  and is more effective. This is partly of course due to the horrifying content  both on the surface and beneath  of HOLOCAUST versus the Witch. (No offense to BW, btw, I thought it was a good movie.) But Deodato is also a maestro of horror. His horror is graphic and visually vicious by design, but also equally masterminded is the visceral connection the visceral acts of horror have with emotional, psychological and even spiritual components of his victims the viewers. Deodato, in other words, does what few horror filmmakers have done, by horrifying us on every level, from base gross-out to sublime gut terror, from grisly gore to existential absolute zero, all at once. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST really deserves the emotional rollercoaster quote too quickly applied to other, far less impacting films. I would dare say HOLOCAUST is among the upper echelon of truly great horror films. It belongs on the same shelf, call me blasphemer if you will, as the likes of Stanley Kubricks The Shining and William Friedkins The Exorcist. It stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of Fulci or Argento. This is stratospheric praise from me. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is a great horror film because it is not only a great horror film but because it transcends genre boundaries by being vivid, searing art. Art is art. Great art is great art. Regardless of its phenomenal form. And GRINDHOUSE RELEASING has given the film a release it deserves. TWO discs and bonus features piled up like innards in a gutmuncher flick. Even an article by the great Chas Balun AND a mini CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST POSTER. The DVDs look like film rolls and are labeled Reel 1 and Reel 2. Its a badass package from the main guts to the special treats. A smorgasborg of smart horror.",1362268800,4,3324,4.9891696750902526

2401504,3,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust is a pretty ghastly film. Everything you could ever possibly want of your average cannibal rape exploitation frenzy of gore is present and correct. It's a complete checklist of all the now legendary things one might expect to find in a subgenre that is remarkable if for no other reason that it club membership is as small as the genre was fleeting. And once you wave away the half-hearted attempts at any distinctive plot, this,Cannibal Ferox, And Eaten ALive! (especially Eaten Alive actually, for all it's Jonestown plotting it's little more than a montage of the other two) are pretty much the same film.

But of the three, I personally consider this the stand out. And actually, even 30 years later, I find it really quite unsettling viewing. The Ogrish/Liveleaks gorefiends will scoff at that, they've seen actual beheadings. But there's just something about the sheer grit and the lengths that Deodato went to in attempting to achieve some level of genuine authenticity, from the awesomely foreboding 'green inferno' locations, the garish Mondo styling, the shaky handcam, and yes, those reprehensible scenes of animal torture. It all comes together to make an edgier package than one might expect from a movie that's has a reputation it shouldn't ever be able to live up to.

When judged in it's own place and time, I'm not in the least bit surprised that those Italian courts thought they were dealing with snuff. There's enough going on here, despite the typically woeful acting and script, and often wobbly effects to make you hold your breath now and again and wonder ""What the hell did I just see?"". I suspect a lot of it does actually hinge on the animal brutality - if you can make it through those (most definitely not National Geographic, believe!) without fast fowarding or closing your eyes/putting your fingers in your ears, it's odds on that you're likely to at least feel a sense of unease about what might unfold next.

It is classic exploitation stuff, it's as raw as the giblets, and it's wall to wall whacko of a kind that the start of the 80s was famed for. But then aspects of the film surprise, from the excellent quality of the soundtrack, to visuals that I find strangely appealing despite some of the goings on, no doubt due to those locations, but also because of the mondo documentary ambition that's so evident.

And then there's the 'found footage' aspect. I'm a sucker for them, no matter how poor or how formulaic they turn out to be. This is the Grandaddy as far as I know, and because it's not following an established formula,it's pulled off in a way that's not without mistakes but still manages to fit in very well with the overall way the film has been shot, even the obviously traditionally set up dramatic scenes have those nasty reels woven into them, to great effect.

Cannibal Holocaust is not a film one can comfortably enthuse about, it's classic exploitation and things happen here that few movie makers, even the French, could get away with. They literally don't make them like this anymore, and that's probably a good thing for reasons that go beyond the gore. But doesn't mean this movie can be just palmed off as another video nasty that doesn't live up to it's legendary status, it's a little more than that, maybe not too much, but enough.",1359849600,4,3316,4.76

I will give credit where credit is due:  This is probably the first ""Found footage"" films, which happens to be a genre I love.  I still wish I hadn't seen this.

The extended scenes of suffering in the movie happen to women and only to women.  The men do suffer too but not as long and as explicitly on screen as the women.  Why?...The first third of the movie is kind of an interesting look at the jungle and the people who live in it. I found this to be the most interesting part of the film. You won't find many movies that actually go to the jungle to film and it's fascinating to see it all.

Long before ""the Blair Witch Project,"" & much more gruesome (still one of the most gruesome films of horror cinema), & still controversial today, is 1980's, ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" which featured live animals being killed, though not as cruel as it's led people to believe that did not see this film, it was still very unnecessary. The animals were killed as food, but you don't need to kill real animals for that in a fictitious film. It does get it's point over strongly though. Survival.

More gruesome is it's total depiction of cannibal debauchery, torture, & mutilation, but this film does have a purposeful question to ask, & moral to teach. Who is worse, us or the Cannibals?

Initially I didn't keep much expectations from it, but as the film went further my eyes widened and got glued to the screen and I was holding my breath every second. Robert Kerman is brilliant as the protagonist and everything from the atmosphere to the characters will keep you engaged. Not even for once you feel you are watching a film, it is more like witnessing a raw and explicit  documentary on cannibalism. Rarely is a film so visually engaging and gives you much more than just a cinematic experience. A film to look out for, everything from the characters to the violence is brilliantly showcased and moreover, very genuine.

2401588,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Yes, I love this movie and I not ashamed to own up to it and No, I'm not a sociopath. In fact, I've been waiting for years for Cannibal Holocaust to make the transfer to DVD. And the wait has paid off. I won't go into the details of the storyline as you can read the other numerous reviews for that. What I will say is that ""Sometime during the 1970s, four young adults disappeared in the jungles of South America while shooting a documentary. Six months later, their footage was found"" and what was captured on film were some of the most depraved acts of savagery ever seen. Rape, a village massacre, penis severing, and numerous acts of animal cruelty are just a little sampling of what's to come in this masterpiece of sadism including the most iconic scene where a woman is found impaled on a post from her rear through her mouth. So why did I give it a 5-star rating? Because the film achieves exactly what it sets out to do which is to shock and disgust you. This is extreme horror at its finest and its the patriarch of this ""found footage"" craze that we are going through right now. Without Cannibal Holocaust, there would be no The Blair Witch Project, no Paranormal Activity, no Quarantine, or no Apollo 18. So if you're in the mood for an extremely in your face horror movie, grab this movie now. And for those of you that are still whining about watching animals die, there is a version of the movie on this disc that cuts all of critter deaths out all together. Too bad it doesn't feature that ""Chick-vision"" feature that Cabin Fever had where a pair of hands appeared on screen that blocked out all the scary, gory parts. But then again, you'd miss about 98% of the movie.",1332028800,3,1686,4.389776357827476
2401589,1,B000B5Y0CS,"First of all this review was to me a personal need: Basically, I've made it my habit, to find out prior less as possible about a book or a movie to form my own impartial opinion. On ""Cannibal Holocaust"" I knew that it was a controversial in Germany confiscated mockumentary (it is said, one of the first of its kind, but sources appear to me now rather dubious). I must confess that my intention to be impartial has been repented in this case, because when I finally saw the movie, I was appalled and disgusted.

Ruggero Deodato leaves the viewer in his film, among other things, participate in it as a living coati pup is repeatedly stabbed with a sharp stick in the torso until it dies in the hands of the actor (after several minutes of death struggle). A snake and a spider are hacked to pieces alive with a machete. In another scene, a turtle is turned on its back and then cut up alive and eviscerated by several people. Shortly after, a  squirrel monkey is tortured to death brutally, and finally an actor in close-up is shooting a pig with a gun in the head. He is visibly amused in kicking the frightened animal repeatedly kicked in the stomach with a shod foot. Any questions?

What gives the filmmakers the right to commit such atrocities to animals? It is disastrous to see the idea of man and the world view expressed by the filmmakers. In the book ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" Dostoevsky once wrote: ""Love the animals, God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled. Don't trouble their joy, don't harass them, don't deprive them of their happiness, don't work against God's intent.""
This quote unmasks Deodato as a nihilists and misanthrope, because he also, to convey his message (I will get to it later), was not even able to heed this golden rule. Deodato gives us a sick and sadness-inducing destructive work, which is in a horrible way significant for pathological excesses of human egotism, arrogance, narcissism, perversion, decadence, indifference, lack of empathy and a ruthlessness that offers unequalled opportunities. This film is a shame and a crime. So I threw it from the DVD player into the dustbin directly because it belongs there.

Nevertheless I will try to have a closer look at the film. The first question that arises for me is, that is: Is it really art which Deodato, a largely unsuccessful director in retrospect, presents? A film like ""Irreversible"" works in principle with similar dramatic depictions of violence and can be called functional (even without a lot of goodwill) because this film is able to touch the audience in a very unpleasant way. The difference lies only in the choice of means. The one film draws on fiction, the other idea goes back to real killings, to unfold its effect. I think that Deodato here tries out to show lurid perversions and to give pervert under the guise of art an unjust legitimizing intellectual aristocracy. Maybe it's because that Deodato simply misses the artistic greatness of a Caspar Noe, so that he could realize his vision only in sacrificing the categorical imperative and contradicting himself. Sergio Leone, who was present at the premiere in Italy, expressed it this way: ""What kind of movie, but they will wear you down for it."" Deodato, who is now ashamed of the animal snuff scenes in his film, significantly could never repeat the success. In Italy he had to answer for his botch in court. There he said that the film crew ate the killed animals after having finished film shooting. Shown as a justification for cruelty to animals, I think this is a weak and pushed forward argument. It may be excuses of miserable hedge lawyers, with the aim of revoking Deodato's punishment. Well, everyone deserves the best possible plea; that is for sure. But that does not mean you must accept this nonsense. The Italian judges may have seen it similar, because they imposed the director a multi-year professional ban. The lurid, brutal, violent pornographic images only serve to an end in itself and cause the target of Deodato's film concept to paradoxical absurdity (Ruggero Deodato tries to express a moral critique of the sensationalism of mass media). So the film doesn't shake as an admirer of this film once so smugly posted, ""on the self-righteous dream of the superiority of civilization"", but lives this dream without reflection in an exemplary manner. Yes, dear fans, there's a difference and even an important one. I also read in connection with this botch over again that you should evaluate the animal snuff from of the rest of the movie. I cannot share this opinion because it is a work of art in which the director has assigned the animal snuff an important role in building and strengthening the film atmosphere. A mockumentary is a feature film that pretends to be a documentary. So the atmosphere is like often in horror films, an essential element. The question if the project would have worked even without the snuff works, illuminates an abstract scenario, which is of no interest to the review. Even with the argument of many fans that the meat on the table is the same, I'm not d'accord. In general, one can assume that the suffering of slaughtered animals should be as short as possible. Besides it's here for food whereas in the movie is about entertainment. This is clearly an important qualitative difference in the motivation of appropriate action.

Another popular argument of the fan base is that Cannibal Holocaust was already made and therefore it is of no difference if you watch the film or not. I believe it is extremely questionable to see it like that. For this position you might also claim that the consumption of child pornography is not wrong because it already exists. I think that these two genres are quite comparable in moral terms. Both genres show the conscious and sadistically motivated destruction of living beings documented on film.
Finally you have to admit that the film impresses the viewer. This is probably on the one hand because of the excellent film soundtrack and on the other hand because of the drastic measures used by its director. For me, the physical integrity of creature is more important than the cult status of this film, and I'm proud of not being so indifferent that I would not care. The real killings disqualify this film.

If you are looking for a well done mockumentary, I can recommend you the film ""Man Bites Dog"" (a media criticism with wonderfully sardonic humour). If it should be a study of violence, watch ""Irreversible"". You will be to be getting smaller in your seats. But please do not let yourselves be drawn in the dirt, in which Ruggerio Deodato wallows himself with his sadistic nihilist animal snuff ""Cannibal Holocaust"". You can differentiate between Deodato's unworthy idea of man, and be aware of such an insult.

For me, the physical integrity of creature is more important than the cult status of this film, and I'm proud of not being so indifferent that I would not care. The real killings disqualify this film.

If you are looking for a well done mockumentary, I can recommend you the film ""Man Bites Dog"" (a media criticism with wonderfully sardonic humour). If it should be a study of violence, watch ""Irreversible"". You will be to be getting smaller in your seats. But please do not let yourselves be drawn in the dirt, in which Ruggerio Deodato wallows himself with his sadistic nihilist animal snuff ""Cannibal Holocaust"". You can differentiate between Deodato's unworthy idea of man, and be aware of such an insult.

2401591,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust makes Saw look like a Barney film... ha ha, basically this movie can't be compared to others in it's class, if there even is a class, it's gory, violent, and apparently they kill real animals on set, it can be pretty gruesome, and if you doubt you have the stomach for these kinds of films i wouldn't recommend watching it. I gave this movie 5 stars. i truly believe it to be a real piece of art, some may disagree, but when you think about the plot, the way the film was shot, and some scenes which look incredibly realistic, you get the feeling that a lot of time and effort was put behind it. If your a horror genre freak like myself I highly recommend purchasing this movie, watch it once, watch it twice, and you may never watch it again, but the fact that it's in your arsenal and many people have never seen it says a lot. Good luck, and oh yea, watch it with the lights OFF!",1325203200,3,901,4.213872832369942
2401592,1,B000B5Y0CS,"First of all this review was to me a personal need: Basically, I've made it my habit, to find out prior less as possible about a book or a movie to form my own impartial opinion. On ""Cannibal Holocaust"" I knew that it was a controversial in Germany confiscated mockumentary (it is said, one of the first of its kind, but sources appear to me now rather dubious). I must confess that my intention to be impartial has been repented in this case, because when I finally saw the movie, I was appalled and disgusted.

Ruggero Deodato leaves the viewer in his film, among other things, participate in it as a living coati pup is repeatedly stabbed with a sharp stick in the torso until it dies in the hands of the actor (after several minutes of death struggle). A snake and a spider are hacked to pieces alive with a machete. In another scene, a turtle is turned on its back and then cut up alive and eviscerated by several people. Shortly after, a  squirrel monkey is tortured to death brutally, and finally an actor in close-up is shooting a pig with a gun in the head. He is visibly amused in kicking the frightened animal repeatedly kicked in the stomach with a shod foot. Any questions?

What the f... gives the filmmakers the right to commit such atrocities to animals? It is disastrous to see the idea of man and the world view expressed by the filmmakers. In the book ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" Dostoevsky once wrote: ""Love the animals, God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled. Don't trouble their joy, don't harass them, don't deprive them of their happiness, don't work against God's intent.""
This quote unmasks Deodato as a nihilists and misanthrope, because he also, to convey his message (I will get to it later), was not even able to heed this golden rule. Deodato gives us a sick and sadness-inducing destructive work, which is in a horrible way significant for pathological excesses of human egotism, arrogance, narcissism, perversion, decadence, indifference, lack of empathy and a ruthlessness that offers unequalled opportunities. This film is a shame and a crime. So I threw it from the DVD player into the dustbin directly because it belongs there.

Nevertheless I will try to have a closer look at the film. The first question that arises for me is, that is: Is it really art which Deodato, a largely unsuccessful director in retrospect, presents? A film like ""Irreversible"" works in principle with similar dramatic depictions of violence and can be called functional (even without a lot of goodwill) because this film is able to touch the audience in a very unpleasant way. The difference lies only in the choice of means. The one film draws on fiction, the other idea goes back to real killings, to unfold its effect. I think that Deodato here tries out to show lurid perversions and to give pervert under the guise of art an unjust legitimizing intellectual aristocracy. Maybe it's because that Deodato simply misses the artistic greatness of a Caspar Noe, so that he could realize his vision only in sacrificing the categorical imperative and contradicting himself. Sergio Leone, who was present at the premiere in Italy, expressed it this way: ""What kind of movie, but they will wear you down for it."" Deodato, who is now ashamed of the animal snuff scenes in his film, significantly could never repeat the success. In Italy he had to answer for his botch in court. There he said that the film crew ate the killed animals after having finished film shooting. Shown as a justification for cruelty to animals, I think this is a weak and pushed forward argument. It may be excuses of miserable hedge lawyers, with the aim of revoking Deodato's punishment. Well, everyone deserves the best possible plea; that is for sure. But that does not mean you must accept this nonsense. The Italian judges may have seen it similar, because they imposed the director a multi-year professional ban. The lurid, brutal, violent pornographic images only serve to an end in itself and cause the target of Deodato's film concept to paradoxical absurdity (Ruggero Deodato tries to express a moral critique of the sensationalism of mass media). So the film doesn't shake as an admirer of this film once so smugly posted, ""on the self-righteous dream of the superiority of civilization"", but lives this dream without reflection in an exemplary manner. Yes, dear fans, there's a difference and even an important one. I also read in connection with this botch over again that you should evaluate the animal snuff from of the rest of the movie. I cannot share this opinion because it is a work of art in which the director has assigned the animal snuff an important role in building and strengthening the film atmosphere. A mockumentary is a feature film that pretends to be a documentary. So the atmosphere is like often in horror films, an essential element. The question if the project would have worked even without the snuff works, illuminates an abstract scenario, which is of no interest to the review. Even with the argument of many fans that the meat on the table is the same, I'm not d'accord. In general, one can assume that the suffering of slaughtered animals should be as short as possible. Besides it's here for food whereas in the movie is about entertainment. This is clearly an important qualitative difference in the motivation of appropriate action.

Another popular argument of the fan base is that Cannibal Holocaust was already made and therefore it is of no difference if you watch the film or not. I believe it is extremely questionable to see it like that. For this position you might also claim that the consumption of child pornography is not wrong because it already exists. I think that these two genres are quite comparable in moral terms. Both genres show the conscious and sadistically motivated destruction of living beings documented on film.

When I got this the movie disc had fallen out and been scratched all over and didn't worl. The seller was VERY helpful though and got me a new copy :) I was then able to watch the entire movie. So great seller first of all.

Onto the movie: If you read any other reviews you'll know what this movie is about and that theres plenty of real animal killing. If you can look past the animal cruelty and have an iron stomache this is a very thougth provoking and entertaining movie. This is that film that you see that makes all other horror/grindhouse/shock cinema films look like sesasme street. 6 on-screen animal killings, 4 rape scenes, a castration scene, 2 decapitations, impalement, dismemberment, burning, and of course cannibalism.

This movie makes you think what true savgery is, who is truly civilized on this planet? Is it the natives with their lack of technology and different culture that are the savages? Or is it the ""civilized"" and ""educated"" city people that take advantage of their being no laws and attack the natives? This movie will shock, possibly disturb many viewers. I admit its a little dated, its well over 25 years old now, but for the most part its just as gruesome as the daythey released it.

However I give this film 4/5 because its just simply TOO disturbing to just pick up and watch. This is the kind of movie you watch o see if you can do it and the maybe watch a few years later. If I could do 4.5 though I would because of the AMAZING amount of bonus material. I do reccomend this for thoe into this kind of film.",1317254400,3,1687,4.418006430868167

2401623,2,B000B5Y0CS,"I have been on a quest now, for the past decade or so, to watch every off the cuff, exploitative, Avant-garde, artsy, cult and B movie out there.  I would have to say, for the most part, I have done a pretty good job (yet still work to be done).  I have many notches in my belt and it was just a question of time before I would watch ""Cannibal Holocaust""!

I have known of this movie for many, many years but have been dragging my feet to actually watch it.  The primary reason, to be perfectly frank was I had no real interest in watching actual animals killed/tortured on camera.  I will return to this notion a bit later.  Notwithstanding, I finally decided to ""suck it up"" and lose myself in everything that is ""Cannibal Holocaust"".

I am not going to rehash what has already been stated about this being the most controversial and banned movie ever made.  Watch it for yourself and decide on your own.  The plot is very straightforward; a college professor travels into the jungles of South America to recover the film footage of a missing film crew.  There are many theories and much speculation on what did or did not happen to them.  Therefore finding the film is paramount in understanding their fate.

Using the ruse of paraphrasing, the professor uses a guide, goes in the jungle meets some natives and is able to attain the footage.  The footage is then brought to New York City and is reviewed by the professor and media producers interested in making the lost footage into a documentary. The moral of the story, and I don't think I am giving anything away, is who really are savages, the ""primitive man"" or the ""sophisticated man""?

Is this movie as raw as its reputation precedes itself?  Yes and no.  I have viewed many gory and graphic movies. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is an Italian horror film and Italy is known for pumping out some pretty gruesome stuff.  Decapitation, eating human flesh, nudity, killing, violent raping, violent sex, torture of people and animals are some the elements viewed in this film.  Some of it was pulled off well, where some of it was really cheesy.  Fake heads, shoddy acting and some of the special effects were awful. There are better gore flicks out there. And the soundtrack has some music that sounds like unreleased ABBA instrumentals, which seemed totally out of place, what's that about?

The part of this movie that really rubbed me the wrong way was the killing and (yes) torturing of real animals.  This motive was purely exploitive and did nothing for the film itself. I have heard some critical response saying that seeing these animals killed isn't anything worse than what one might see on the National Geography Channel.  Well if I may be so bold, I have yet to see any NG program show natives cut a turtle up with an ax and then play with its head.  Or a coati that is being stabbed in the neck with a dagger as it shakes and shrieks.  How about a pig kicked then shot? Also if an animal is killed on a NG program, it is by the natives, who need the animals as a source of food. In this movie most animals aren't brought to their demise by natives.  Under the assumption that realism was the goal, use fake animals for close ups. If you have a good editor then it will look authentic.

Perhaps I am sounding a bit too sensitive or wimpy about animals that have perished well over 30 years ago.  However, I watched this movie with a friend of mine and he didn't care for the animals being killed either.  As a matter of fact, it bugged him several days afterward.  Not that I was pleased about seeing murder, torture and rape, but this was done by actors, who were acting (some not that well).  Therefore it allows me the viewer to know that this is make-believe, not real.  Now if I can be freaked out (or moved) by a performance and know it was make-believe, and then you have the ingredients for a damn good movie.

Bottom line, gore hounds and B movie buffs are going to want to see this movie.  I did, despite my personal protests, so my review is not intended to keep or discourage anyone from watching this film.  I did find aspects of the movie interesting; the ""lost footage"" angle was the original ""Blair Witch Project"".  The moral was also a timeless message.  However, this is not a movie I would return to.  I watch many movies again and again.

I am a horror fan, and always gravitate to anything that claims to be shocking. Honestly, this movie really disturbed me, and not because of the gore and scenes of cannibalism. I am a jaded person, and can handle blood and guts without so much as a flinch ;) But, animal torture (especially when it's real) and rape will never sit well with me, and these reasons prompt me to never watch this movie again.

I have been hearing for years about how they killed a bunch of animals on film in this movie and must admit this go's way to far to shock the viewer and is really just animal snuff. I have seen enough animals die in real life and have no need to see it on film. The sad thing is the regular effects are not bad for a early 80's cheapo and I for one thought they were pretty creepy.

Yeah, I'll grant that it has a certain off-putting quality and it isn't exactly light viewing. But still, it is basically a very low budget, amateurish gore-fest, with little redeeming quality. The closing scenes are pretty vivid and the impaled girl is fairly horrendous. But, in the end, Cannibal Holocaust is pretty weak. The final detractor is the fact that several animals were actually killed during its filming. So not only was it amateurish, it was unnecessarily barbaric. In the end, there are many more legitimate films which are far more scary, disturbing and creative. Take a pass on this BS and try: Irreversible, Antichrist, Jacob's Ladder, Requiem For a Dream, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) or many many others.",1294876800,3,890,5.061224489795919
2401627,5,B000B5Y0CS,"I think the stigma that still floats around this film--ie. claims that it is the most ""shocking"", ""banned"", and ""controversial"" film of all time, or Grindhouse's fallacious claim that this is the film ""that goes all the way!""--is actually doing it a disservice. I would also argue that these claims are grossly inaccurate in this day and age.

True, there were multiple waves of chaos and outrage stemming from the film's release.  In fact, Deodato was thought of as a murderer or a ""snuff director"" and had to produce the living actors in the film in order to clear his name with Italian authorities.

But there is also more to this film than shock, gore, and over-the-top violence.  This is what separates Cannibal Holocaust from every other film in this genre. The cover, the description, and the assumed basis of the film lies to you.  This is not a shock film about watching tribes cannibalize others.

Robert Kerman makes a pretty good transition from the world of pornography into the world of cannibals.  He plays Professor Monroe, ""NYU's noted anthropologist"", who is commissioned to travel to South American Amazonia to determine the fate of a documentary crew comprised of 4 young adult documentarians.  These ""brave children of the space age"" are partly artists, partly thrill-seekers, and partly sadists.  The crew became lost while documenting two primitive tribes on the Orinoco River. Monore is fairly excited about getting in the jungle, and nobody that has been exposed to the jungle can see what interest he could possibly have in the ""Green Inferno"" (the Rainforest) or in the Amazon ""savages"".

The film is shot in ""found footage"" or ""gonzo"" fashion.  This adds a gritty, yet intriguing quality.  Perhaps one of the main points that comes across in this film is the uneasiness of the cast.  Sure, there was supposed to be some tension built into the script.  However, there is a very real, very palpable tension that becomes pervasive and supersedes the actor's roles.

There was a lot of sub-textual communication and struggle evident in the film.  The actors appear to have become drained, both physically and mentally, both on and (presumably) off-camera. There was a lot of unintended tension and sorrow that inadvertently 'contaminated' the final print of this film. This adds a dimension that extinguishes the novelty of the cannibal movie genre and casts this flick into a different territory altogether.

There are some negative things about this movie I would be hard-pressed to ignore.  The animal violence can be troubling, as Deodato went through 2 monkeys, a river turtle, a pig, a ""muskrat"" (a South American coatimundi), a snake, and a tarantula (I think).  The graphic, up-close cannibal dinner scenes are plentiful.  And the documentary team from the new world act as savages in their own right in some very difficult, non-palatable, and chaotic scenes.

While the film has it's share of hard-to-stomach scenes, it also reflects a somewhat simple innocence throughout, highlighted by a better-than-expected soundtrack.  Monroe, Chaco, and Miguel are like little kids on a treasure hunt.  In this hunt, we observe a savage way of life, but the difficult imagery forces us to question the basis for our contextual morals.

Does modern Westernized society really exemplify human progress and development at the core?  Is there really a divide between the state of nature and the exploits of ""advanced"" thrill-seekers, adrenaline junkies, and exploitative 'artists'?  Who are the real antagonists in this story? These are the questions that Kerman's character, and by extension Deodato, force us to confront.

If you are looking for a simple and semi-ridiculous cannibal tale, check out ""Cannibal Ferox"" (Kerman's other major offering in the cannibal genre), ""Eaten Alive"", or any other of the cannibal-exploitation era's notable offerings.  If you are looking for a thought provoking, challenging, and curious film, give this one a chance.",1292630400,4,3974,5.14797507788162

Fortunately, I loved the music. In addition, I was highly disturbed by the real animal killings portrayed by the cowards(I meant the camera crew). I have a puppy of my own and I would never kill her for entertainment! But deep down, I bet that heard of the actors(mainly the camera crew) have regretted their actions(Perry Pirkanen actually cried after the turtle scene>_<, <no kidding!>). All and all, my opinion is that the cannibals(despite their barbaric punishments to adulteresses and soon to be mothers) should be praised as the heroes instead of the cowardly film crew.(And if you disagree with my opinion, feel free to express yours and I won't be offended).

I did not care for the animal killings, but I wasn't watching the film for that.  It was for the overall message about human civilization and the question raised by Prof. Munroe, Who are the real cannibals? The FX were passable for it's time and by my standards it was a pretty bloody film and the impaling scene was pretty intense to take in, very realistic.

2401680,3,B000B5Y0CS,"Let me get this out of the way...

This one is absolutely positively NOT for kids...let me say that again, as a father:

THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR KIDS!!

There, I feel my burden of responsibility fulfilled.

OK, now that you've read my title, I can say that while it's a true statement, it doesn't reflect my opinion of the movie as a work.  I myself haven't enjoyed quite a few Best Picture Oscar-winners, but that doesn't mean they were bad films.

I'd heard of this feature for years, everyone telling me how gruesome and horrific it was...I'd heard how the director was arrested for murder, and had to produce the actors to prove he didn't actually kill anyone, etc...so finally, I was able to take the plunge and have a screening of this ""holy grail of horror-dom""...

...I can't say I was disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled, either. For the time this movie was made, I found the misleading title interesting on my viewing...the cannibals were the VICTIMS here, thus, while accurate, the title takes you to a more horror film place in your mind. That said, the movie didn't SCARE me in any way...I was deeply unsettled by the animal scenes (although I agree with another reviewer that one can see much worse on NatGeo or Discovery, I tend to lean with the reviewer that said it was done in this film as shock value, and thus simply used the poor animals as exploited props; let's face it, it could have and SHOULD have been faked), put off somewhat by the gratuitious nudity (nudity in some respects would be necessary in a film about tribal natives, but this film definitely went further than it needed to), and found the attitudes of the characters deplorable and morally reprehensible...but it never SCARED me.

So it was quickly obvious, this film is a social statement about how little we as humans have actually evolved from our primitive beginnings disguised as a ""horror film"", using brutality and shock to make us understand it's point.

Now is this movie a standing social statement to be lauded?  In some circles, perhaps; it IS effective in what it attempts to show us, albeit over the top and without explanation in some cases, and I certainly don't believe it was ambitious enough to ""change your life""...but it could definitely change your outlook, depending upon the objectivity you watch it with.  There IS a message in the film...one we might not want to hear.

Now before you grab the straightjacket and shuffle me off to the booby hatch, I'm not in any way trying to say that this movie is Oscar quality...heavens no!  However, it's cinematography, score, and theme was surprisingly well done, especially for it's time...as the ancestor to ""The Blair Witch"" and ""Cloverfield"", I think cinema owes this little film a debt, especially us horror fans.  The acting wasn't very good, but it held it's own with other horror flicks of the time (and even today, in many cases).

Again, I did NOT enjoy this movie... but I don't think it's intent was to be enjoyed.",1284163200,3,2979,4.690978886756238
2401681,4,B000B5Y0CS,"This film is controversial as all hell.  I'm sure many know that the director was charged with murder shortly after the premiere because it looked so real.  In fact, the contracts for his actors said that they were not allowed to appear in public for 1 year after the debut, which, naturally, made the allegations of 'Cannibal Holocaust' being snuff all the more real.

However, he killed no humans.  Even the impalement scene was easily accomplished by having the actress sit on a bicycle seat affixed to the end of a wooden pole and balance a piece of balsa wood in her mouth.

So while no humans were harmed in the making of 'Cannibal Holocaust,' 7 animals were killed, some in a fashion more violent than others.

I'll break down what exactly happened to each animal.

1. A coatimundi was stabbed in the neck by one of the actors. I do not know if it was later eaten.

2. A turtle was decapitated and had it shell removed. The actors cooked and ate the turtle. I assume the rest of it was later eaten by the Natives used in the film and that the shell was also put to use. Its legs continue twitching after it's decapitated, but that's probably (I'm no doctor) a physiological reaction that comes from decapitation and not 'pain.' You can't feel pain if you have no head because pain is controlled by the brain.

3. A large spider is killed with a machete. If you have ever smushed a spider or indeed any insect, then you can't complain.

4. A snake is killed with a machete. It was probably eaten by the natives after the scene was filmed because snake is known to be quite tasty.

5. A squirrel monkey has its face cut off with a machete. This scene was filmed twice, resulting in the death of two squirrel monkeys. It has been confirmed that the indigenous cast members ate both monkeys because it's considered a delicacy.

6. A pig is kicked twice and then shot. I assume it was later cooked because...why waste a pig?

--

Now, I don't approve of the use of real animals and Deodato himself said that it was stupid to involve animals. However, the point was to show the barbarism of humanity, and, especially, Western 'civilization.' This point could have easily been relayed through fake animals and special effects.

However, if anything, this film made it necessary for animal usage in films to be overseen by a member of the ASPCA, so it did prevent further cruelty to animals in film.

As for the film itself, it's important because it was a pioneer of the 'found footage' sub-genre.  It blurred the lines between film and reality, and if you can't take anything away from it, at least appreciate the fantastic score.

If you're a student of film, you should see this because it's a landmark title, especially in the realm of horror.  But it's not for the faint of heart.",1282953600,3,2785,4.51195219123506

If you can sit through the SAW movies, this is an easy watch.  Very little bloodshed by today's standards and anyone watching this film just for shock value will not be happy with it and will be bored.  As for the ""animal killings"" shown in the film, I don't see what the fuss is all about unless it is comment on how screwed up our values have become.  Somehow we can watch inferred footage of bombs falling on a city on CNN and think little of it but to see an animal getting killed makes us all upset.  In this film a turtle is quickly killed and dissected and eaten.  It is not tortured.  It is not left to die on the side of the road.  If this were an episode of Survivor Man, it would be accepted without comment.  If you have trouble seeing animals killed than god forbid you should ever watch The Discovery Channel.  If you want to watch an interesting comment on how media and journalists can manipulate the truth and how corporations have a blood lust that matches none other, than this could be a good film for you.

2401683,1,B000B5Y0CS,"I rented this movie a couple of years ago, not knowing anything about it. How I wish I hadn't. Look I'm not condemning exploitation/horror films or the people who like them. I too went through a big phase of Euro-Exploit-Splat features, thus the renting of this film. However this film, and I am loathe to say this, should be censored or unreleased. I've never felt that way about a work of ""fiction"" before, but it is not the fiction which is so disturbing, it's the reality that goes along with it.

 The human violence scenes are pretty disgusting, and the rape scenes are vile. But what is indefensible (and I hope some of the people who gave this film 5 stars think about this) are the scenes of animal torture that where performed by the European cast, in which real animals were actually maimed, tortured and killed for the sake of an exploitation film.

I thought about not describing these scenes, as I have no desire to revisit the carnage, but I fear that some will be titillated at the idea of these controversial scenes and end up watching this as a result of our natural morbid curiosity as humans.

However, if seeing a) a rodent get stabbed in the neck repeatedly with a pocket knife until it (eventually) dies; or b) watching a giant tortoise having it's arms, then legs then head cut off while it is still alive; or c) a monkey (actually two, since the scene was shot twice) have it skull chopped open with a machete is something that not only you want to see, but would give a five star rating to, then I have serious doubts as to your worth as a member of civilized society.

As for the movie itself, it is a classic cannibal movie, far better than any of its imitators (CANNIBAL FEROX, SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, etc.).

The (human on human) violence and gore are extreme, yet necessary to the narrative. HOLOCAUST is meant to be shocking, as well as shaming to our rancid, media-obsessed culture.

2401716,1,B000B5Y0CS,"There have been a  slew of cannibal films made over the years. Much like the Italian ""Mondo"" or ""Faces of Death"" films - The Italian cannibal films make an attempt at a pseudo-documentary feel by mixing real with staged segments. The films are always salacious and mostly intended for audiences who want to be shocked, repulsed, or obtain crude topics for water-cooler conversation. These films typically hide their sideshow-like exploitation behind a pretense of a higher purpose - to lecture the viewer on something (almost always negative) about human behavior, in particular hypocrisy, stupidity and inhumanity.  Any information or messages provided in any of these films should be taken with a dumpster of salt. Even the best of these films are in no way real documentaries.  Most of these films tend to be patronizing to their audience and condescending toward the people, customs, religions and life-styles of non-Europeans.

North Americans and Indigenous South American people seem to be the main targets for the condescension in the Cannibal Holocaust.

The Cannibal Holocaust DVD has the option of watching the film without the animal cruelty scenes and this was the way I watched the film.

After experiencing the film this way, I have to say that the animal cruelty must be enticing high praises from the sickos who apparently enjoy the sadistic pleasure of seeing real helpless animals tortured and killed. For without the animal cruelty what is left is the following:

Horribly inept, amateurish acting.  Many actors look uncomfortable and clueless as if they had no direction at all.

Laughably lame dialogue delivered by very poor dubbing actors.

Lazy, unimaginative staging by director Ruggero Deodato.

The editing is the equivalent of a ditch-digger chopping together moments from his dull vacation at the local landfill.  Only this would be an absolute insult to both ditch-diggers, and landfills alike.

Cheapo film quality, cameras and lenses.

The Soundtrack by the usually reliable Riz Ortolani is the equivalent, in this film, to travelogue-style elevator music.

The locations are bland and uninteresting, considering this film was supposedly shot in South America. The film makes it appear that South America is made up of mud puddles.

If it's zombie-style gore that viewers are interested in - There is actually very little gore without the animal cruelty - the gross-out shocking gore is what these things are supposed to be about - isn't it?

Much of the film is meant to appear as ""found footage"", but not for an instant would anyone believe that Cannibal Holocaust contains one iota of real found footage.

Ultimately the film is slow, cheesy and unmoving with little to no action and cheap effects.  To top it all off - the film is not the slightest bit scarey.

The only positive eliminate that can be said for Cannibal Holocaust is a potentially interesting theme; that the behavior of some narcissistic western journalists can be as savage as the cannibals being investigated. But this theme arrives on an empty plate when you realize that the makers of Cannibal Holocaust chose to kill and film innocent animals for their movie.  Therefor the only real savages and hypocrites are the makers Cannibal Holocaust themselves.

Yes - unforgivably the director and producers of Cannibal Holocaust chose to film and include animal torture and killing in their dreadfully inept movie, which makes Cannibal Holocaust lower then the worst unadulterated k-rap that you might see ripped to shreds on MST3000. Even MST3000 found this film beneath them.

The film makers and all involved including those who praise this junk should be ashamed of themselves. I will not mince words here - Cannibal Holocaust even without the animal cruelty is extremely cheesy, very dull, and poorly made junk.  Adding in the animal cruelty brought this poor excuse of a film to an unmeasurable low level.

From what I read, there are six actual on-screen animals deaths filmed expressly for the movie. I understand that some animals were then vivisected in front of the camera as well as a notorious brain eating scene performed on a monkey and dismembering a turtle before killing it. I also understand that at least one additional animal was killed for the movie as some animal brutality scenes had to be re-shot using a different animal.

There are people who give Cannibal Holocaust merit because they state it's ""found footage"" idea was an original concept and inspired Blair Witch?  That's a reason?  The Holocaust was an original concept and inspired Shindler's list to some degree too.  Is that a reason to praise the Holocaust?

Blair Witch is like Citizen Kane in comparison to Cannibal Holocaust. Blair Witch, shot on a lower budget, is actually creepy, moves forward, suspenseful, had believable acting and good dialogue, its not horribly dubbed, and its scarey, but most of all Blair Witch never resort to animal cruelty.

Just because someone, something, some book, or some film comes up with an original idea and and then proceeds to be as cruel, gross, mean and tasteless as possible, as a pretense for some contrived message, does not mean it automatically merits a place of honor. Apparently some morons who praise this film think otherwise. They should be ashamed.

Since writing this review - I have learned that director of Cannibal Holocaust, Ruggero Deodato has since regretted his use of animals in the film. Whether his remorse is genuine or merely an empty response to pressure and criticism, only Deodato knows. But Deodato's mea culpas do not excuse the  so called ""human beings"" who continue to heap praise on this or any film that exploits the torture and killing of people or live animals.",1278288000,,5729,5.06063829787234

A snow storm delayed the arrival of this dvd and I eagerly awaited the arrival of this dvd with much anticipation and little patience.  When it finally arrived weeks after I had ordered it, I drove two hours to watch this with another horror film buff friend of mine.

What a let-down.

Everything you have heard about this movie is true, except that it is good.  It is gory, violent, sexually violent, cruel to animals, and more.  None of this bothered me, I know the difference between reality and a movie, and although the animal cruelty scenes may upset some people, it is no worse than documentary footage of slaughterhouses like ""Blood of the Beasts"". What is unforgiveable is that this movie is BORING!  The dialogue is so poorly written that I wouldn't have been surprised to find out that the whole film was adlibbed.  The acting is par for 70's horror (so it was bad) and some of the action sequences where so incongruent with the story line that one can tell the scenes are only being filmed to shock, and not to advance a plot of any kind.

Save your money, save your time. Life is too short to watch bad movies.

I'm no vegetarian or PETA member, but I am an animal lover and have an issue with animals being slaughtered for the sole purpose of a film, which Deodato admitted to having done and also claims it is his biggest regret. I found that a little disturbing, not in a horror film sort of way, in a pissed off kind of way. I don't disagree with animals being used for food, but not slaughtered for entertainment. That's just sick in my book. I would characterize that similar to torturing animals for fun. I just don't think your right in the head if that is your idea of entertainment. And to make matters worse, it was clearly just for shock value and those scenes had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. It was like the film maker said ""Gee, we have to interject this somewhere to disgust people. Just put it here."" I also feel similarly about the half dozen or so brutal rape scenes in this one. They had NO plot value, were clearly intended solely for shock value and didn't shock me, they just ticked me off because there was so no reason for it.

The plot in and of itself is completely unimaginative and hasn't a single original idea. It still follows the typical sin factor rules, it just runs it in reverse. First we find out who is dead, then why they deserved it. And the word Cannibal in the title is purely misleading. Cannibal? Where?

I heard this was outlawed in many countries worldwide including Italy (its native country). So it initially struck me as right up my ally of cult horror, but had no real value whatsoever, and I wish I had been warned more sternly about some of the controversial elements. Hell, I might even be willing to live with those if they at least had some value to the plot line. So if you want to watch it, go ahead and be my guest.

Due to the notorious reputation of the film and its status as a '70s Italian cannibal film, one may expect this film to be yet another gore-flick.  Surprisingly enough, the film carries a somewhat strong and poignant point addressing the dangers of the media.  It is typically viewed by gorehounds and people with strong curiosities at face value; look underneath the graphic displays of violence and anthropophagy, and you will see that Deodato is speaking against the media and using the nauseatingly realistic scenes to invoke sensationalism in the viewer.  This is what sets this film apart from mindless, self-indulgent gore flicks such as Saw II-VI, Hostel, Lucio Fulci's movies, and Cannibal Ferox--which, unfortunately, is often compared to this film.  This movie also effectively uses the technique of role-reversal; in other words, the civilized become the ""savages"" and vice-versa.  Cannibal Holocaust must be commended on for its great gore FX, naturalistic photography, and Deodato's somewhat meticulous realism with the ""documentary"" footage which ultimately got him into trouble with the law.  The continuously-commented-on animal deaths, although not defendable or justifiable, further add to this realism.  Despite the graphic nature of Cannibal Holocaust, it is, nonetheless, a film I can recommend because of its versatility of being viewed thematically, metaphorically, and allegorically, or viewed at mere face value to satisfy morbid curiosities and gorehounds.",1266364800,,1723,5.5

The killing of animals for entertainment purposes is beyond the pale and the brutality of the characters could have easily been portrayed using props. My first reaction after seeing this garbage is that I wanted to tear out some of the director's limbs to see how he liked it.

If Ruggero Deodato had any true talent, he could have made this movie without hurting or torturing a living thing. He should have learned something from Lucio Fulci, who made many films that are horrifying, shocking and realistic-looking.

I saw this movie for the first time at 17 years old and it wasn't even the uncut version and I was blown away by the violence and macabre this film had to offer, I remember saying to myself wow I don't know if I would ever watch that again, sure enough I maned up and watched it again when the uncut version came out and the extreme power of this film just blew me away.

I just wanted to point out that this particular release is the Australian 2-disc special edition released by Siren Visual. It is EXACTLY the same as the limited edition 11,111 2-disc set that was released by Grindhouse in the USA. I actually own both editions, and they have the same cut of the film, same menus, same features, same easter eggs, etc. So it appears that Siren Visual have just re-branded the American discs in different packaging for Australian release. It is not a limited edition in itself, it's just that not a huge amount were made for the small Australian market.

2401767,3,B000B5Y0CS,"I am not sure what to make of this movie. Basically, it is in two parts. A group of college kids go to South America with a camera to film a caniballistic tribe. There must have been something in the water down there, because before they even introduce themselves, they rape a little native girl, and begin terrorizing the local tribespeople.

Maybe the water was fine. Maybe the film students were sadistic little SOBS to begin with. They seem to be making up their story instead of documenting it, burning huts and yelling Vietnam---getting off on brutality as well as filming it. The sociopathic little creeps become the stars of their own horrormentry. Two of them get so excited, they have to go have sex during the rampage.

Needless to say, they soon, litterally, get their heads handed to them--the female student is savagely raped-and then their hosts have them for lunch. Not easy to watch, but you can't work up much symapathy for the brats, either. Their stupidity alone makes you think they had it coming. What did they think would happen?

Soon, a professor goes to find the kids. He, unlike them, actually knows what he is doing. Obeying the customs of the tribe, he and his party are well treated. The professor is able to recover the canisters of films--this was the late 70s, no cell cams or digital chips to hold footage--and he brings them back to New York. He discovers both the activites and the fate of the students.

What to make of this!?: Obviously, the film documents violence, and few are innocent. One cannibal rapes his wife to death for adultery, but when we see the students behavior, it is just as maddening.  You obviously get to ask the question ""who are the real savages?"" but this is a hackneyed question that goes back to the crusades. Unlike a Pechenpah or a 1990s Clint Eastwood film, Cannibal Holocaust does not have a lot of moral ambiguity  or complexity to its violence.

The scenes are also horribly graphic. When the kids are killed, you do get some sense of vindication  as a viewer, but it is not a strong catharsis and the killing is  brutal. Would they have lived if they had conducted themselves differently? Hard to say. The professor came back unscathed, but it is immpossible to know if it is because of his repect for the natives or his expertise in their culture that saved him.

I can't decide whether this is sensationalist violence or a study in behavior that does not pose enough questions to make it high art. I also don't understand why it is termed as a horror film--it does not contain suspence or use the dramatic devices most movies of this genre do.

Still, this does have cult status and thinking about what Cannibal Hollocost means is interesting. If you are not overly upset by this type of film, it is gripping enough to take a look.",1247875200,4,2804,4.610441767068273

cannibal holocaust has me torn. CH goes beyond b-movie gore, shoots right past grindhouse and touches upon the land of snuff. i believe that CH was the first film to be shot documentary style, and also the first film to be banned by everyone on planet earth. graphic depictions of rape, torture, & mutilation are par for the course in this film. worse still, CH features REAL depictions of animal torture & decapitation for the juvenile sake of simply shocking the audience.
CH starts with a professor hired to locate some missing documentary filmmakers that had gone to shoot warring cannibal tribes in the ""green inferno"" (amazon). the first half of the film is shot like a regular movie: the professor finds that the filmmakers are obviously dead, locates the reels of footage they took, and then heads back home to New York. the second half of the film sees the professor reviewing the film, then trying to convince some tv execs not to air the material due to the fact that the content is far too graphic and cruel. he shows the footage to the tv execs and we (the viewers) are also subject to the documentary. right of the bat, the film crew leaves much to be desired: it seems that their cruelty knows absolutely no bounds: the first footage is of a turtle being utterly mutilated. to compound the degradation of the animal, one of the filmmakers starts playing with the twitching & severed head of the animal. the turtle's body goes into shock and then begins to convulse. it's legs are then systematically severed and then its shell is torn off. after that, the turtles internal organs are removed and thrown, played with and then eaten. i suppose this is to show the audience the film crews ability to survive in the wild- yet the cruelty to which the animal is subjected is all that is apparent. this is shock cinema at it's most gruesome and depraved. next, the group finds a tribe of natives. they gang rape one of the women, then proceed to herd most of the tribe into a straw hut where they then burn them alive. the only reason given for this barbarism is to show the tribe that they are dominant and that they should be feared. more terror, forced human abortions & animal torture continue, finally finding the filmmakers captured by another, this time cannibal, tribe. the filmmakers are then mutilated and eaten. the female filmmaker is raped, then mutilated, then eaten. after seeing all the footage, the execs agree to not air the film and instead, to burn all the footage. finally, the professor asks a question to the audience, ""who really are the savages? us or them?""
again, this film has me torn: on one level, what a breakthrough in film narrative. simply put, a documentary within a film posing a compelling question about modern man. genius! on another and far more personal level: i hope everyone who had a hand in the creation of this film burns in hell. how dare you torture & kill animals in the name of 'art'? in 1985 a film called cannibal holocaust crossed a line it had absolutely NO REASON to cross! without the real animal cruelty, the film would have been shocking and disturbing enough. instead, the creators wanted to get their rocks-off by torturing animals in hopes that it would take their film to another universe of realism. sad and desperate, CH only succeeds in being a vehicle made to shock when it could have been so much more.",1244592000,8,3398,4.644518272425249

The movie is pretty good considering it is one of those cheap-made gore-fest types. What I hate most about these type movies is the camera-shaking, which makes me sick. This one is not too bad in that department, and I managed to watch the whole thing and get only a mild headache from it.

This movie contains rape, gang rape, gore, evisceration, vomiting close-ups, frontal nudity, people being set afire, radical leg amputation, radical penis amputation(yes they show it), and other stuff you will never see in a theatre.

But what bothered me, as an animal lover, is that all of the scenes showing animal harm appear to be absolutely real. Several animals were killed for this movie including a large turtle, a pig, a monkey, a water rat,a snake,and a tarantula. The turtle, a specimen about 3 feet across, is obviously real and they really decapitate it. Then its severed head is played with.

With all of the fake human-killing going on in this movie, you would think they could have made a little effort to fake the animal killings as well, but they obviously did not want to bother. For this reason alone I don't recommend this movie which uses real animal cruelty as a filler between the staged scenes of human gore. Sick.",1243641600,3,1383,4.63265306122449

""Cannibal Holocaust"" is little more than a snuff film with animals, in lieu of humans, as the actors and murder victims.  The stomach-turning filming of the actual killing and mutilating of animals is not art.

2401775,4,B000B5Y0CS,"For a 30 year old film, it still reigns as highly disturbing. Each scene pushes the limits of the human psyche, whether it is the extreme animal cruelty, the over the top rape scenes or the devourment of human entrails. The film starts off with a professor and two well trained men going into the jungle seeking answers to a film crew's disappearance. The first half of the film is rather mundane with little intensity, however, your interest is still held. With that said, there still remains some controversial scenes to the dissatisfaction of the weak willed. The second half of the film, where the film crews reels are recovered and brought back to ""modern"" society, begin to slide into nothing more than an exploitation film. This however, is not necessarily a bad thing if you are into such. The camera view changes to ""actual footage"" the film crew shot.  The rape scenes are somewhat over the top and not very convincing, and at times drag on too long. The animal cruelty is real and you do not get more convincing and nauseating than that. Having a strong stomach for
gore, I found myself disturbed by the beheading of the turtle and the stabbing to death of the squealing ""muskrat"". There are four other views of animal killings, however the impact pales in comparison to the two previously mentioned. The gore filled cannibal scenes of entrail devourment and the mass squabble for raw meat are gruesome, however typical fare for zombie films.

In the end, you feel justified that the film crew got what they deserved, but are left with disturbing thoughts of who the real ""savages"" were, not to mention, how modern society relishes in the exploitation of others for money and for continued sensationalism.

That was when I really got into horror films by George Romero, Dario Argento, Sam Raimi, Wes Craven, and on and on. Recently I watched Cannibal Holocaust uncut at age 19 on the internet thinking I was ready but I wasn't ready enough(lol).
  Ruggero Deodato directed this and remains a cult director today, even appearing in Hostel II and currently making Cannibals(a sequel or Americanized version of Cannibal Holocaust) for mainstream release. The cast includes former adult film actor Robert Kerman, several lesser-knowns, and mostly real natives(if it's true but not sure). The film is actually centered on a professor who goes to a South American jungle to find out why ""the"" documentary crew disappeared. The professor brings the reels back, then we find out what happened and see the footage(which is part of the story). The film has 80's independent Italian drama graphics while the ""footage"" has realistic documentary graphics. The score has mainly two theme tracks with one as the pleasant theme track and the other as the disturbing theme track(which stays in the mind).
  Now I'm sure people want to know alot about the content. It's graphically violent and graphically sexual. There is frontal male and female nudity as well but it's mostly cultural and the male nudity is not up close. The violence is again graphic and looks real in the ""footage."" I was disturbed by some killings and animal slayings. The animal killings where genuine, graphic and some even perpetrated by the actors(other than the natives). The sexual content is graphic, not hardcore, but graphic since there are brief rapes and casual sex scenes. This is not for everyone and not many get away not shocked.
  My opinion is the film is bad for the acting and such but yet it's good for it's cinematography and elements. I like how it's a film-inside-a-film like those films about a fictional snuff film inside like 8mm. This film has no point yet it does have satire.

It's true, the scenes of animals being killed were authentic, but here's a very important detail that people leave out: all of the animals killed were then given to native tribal people (many of whom acted as extras in the film).  These native tribal people cooked and ate the animals.

This film shows the killing of the animals in all its horror and ugliness.  And, make no mistake, it IS both horrifying and ugly.  But the killing of these animals provided a food source for people; how is this morally any different from what goes on in slaughterhouses across the world every day?  I have a sneaking suspicion that many of the people expressing such outrage over these animal scenes aren't vegetarians.  The meat you and I eat is killed, often in just as brutal a manner as what is portrayed in this movie.  Is the killing of animals acceptable only if we don't look at it?

I have no beef (pardon the pun) with people who dislike Cannibal Holocaust because they are uncomfortable looking at the scenes of animals dying, and I'd agree that anyone who enjoys watching the animals being killed has something dreadfully wrong with them.  But to equate anyone who appreciates the film on its own merits with those sick individuals is deeply unfair.

As for my review of the film as a whole, I come down somewhere in the middle.  It's quite thought-provoking in places (not to mention its propensity to shock), but the pacing is extremely uneven, and it becomes quite boring at times.  The film is fairly effective in making a point about what we consider to be ""civilized society"", but I feel that other movies have made a similar point more effectively (Wes Craven's 1977 classic The Hills Have Eyes comes to mind).  Ultimately, I wish I could give this movie 3.5 stars, as 3 seems a bit low and 4 seems a bit high. Since that's not an option, I'll err on the side of caution.

Maybe I have become descensitized by viewing real crime scene video and pictures on the web, but even if I hadn't, there are still horror flicks out there that can rival this in a heartbeat (effects wise).

Yes, for its time, it was ingenious. It was right up there in the nitty gritty of realism. It still holds that but the acting was terrible and not believable. That was my tip-off for a hokey gore fest. But to me, it really wasn't a gore fest at all. The only WTF? moments I had were the animal killings (which were real) and the rape of a villager by the ""film crew"".

One thing I am anal about is when I see movies portraying certain types of animals as they are most certainly not (anachronisms?). When the guide was bitten by a snake in his boot, anyone who has a most basic understanding of reptiles knows a Red-Tailed Boa Constrictor on sight. But yet, they go on and kill the juvi snake and amputate his leg.

The next thing is the raping of a captured woman. Faye isn't pissed off that the rest of the crew are raping hthe woman, but she is more concerned that they might not have enough film left for the project!?!?! She only gets pissed off when her boyfriend (the film director) gets in on the action? Personally, she deserved what came to her.

One thing this film tells us is that you reap what you sow.",1226966400,2,1535,4.29757785467128
2401854,5,B000B5Y0CS,"This review is from a fan's perspective of the film. There are tons of plot summaries out there, and to go over it again would waste you (the reader's time) on whether or not to see this exploitation masterpiece.

The first time I saw this movie was when I was in eighth grade. Being young,  and interested in the ""unseen"" side of horror I traveled to a comic convention where my friends and I were recommended this, and from that night on this film has stayed with me.

In the years since I've first seen this film my opinion of it has changed. Then I viewed it as a graphic film to only offer violence as a way to shock it's audience, which it does flawlessly. Now I view it as a film that looks at how modern media exploits the horrors of our world. We as a society still thrive off of our violent news, movies, music, and numerous other sources of media to allow ourselves the sensation of the macabre. I feel that this film shows that, and though while it is grotesque and disturbing in it's method it's also effective. Yes this film does contain numerous (and deplorable) acts of animal cruelty, in my opinion they are done to emphasis the horror of the media in which this tale is presented.

Due to this film's increasing cult status (in large thanks to the amazing Grindhouse DVD's over the past few years) this film is being sought after by younger and younger audiences. Even though I myself saw this at a younger age, I do not suggest that for everyone as this is a brutal film and to be viewed only by those who can handle the content.

With all of that being said, I understand that this film will not be for everyone, even those who enjoy the horror genre. This is not a positive film, and you wouldn't walk away from it with a smile, but maybe you'd look at yourself and find out why you enjoy these films. It very well might be that you're deranged, but if you're anything like myself then the reason you watch films such as Cannibal Holocaust is to look at the horrors of the world. Because even in the darkest depths of the human psyche, there is still some beauty to behold.",1226880000,3,2094,4.318066157760814

The only reason anyone even watches ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is to see what all of the fuss is about.  That is why I wanted to watch it myself.  I just wish I had known that I would be watching cruel tourture of innocent animals. I had to turn away and actually covered my ears so that I couldn't hear the poor animals dying.

Not just the f/x - which to this day the director refuses to disclose - it's a relentless examination of man's inhumanity to man. Brutal, real, sickening - and it IS sickening. Comparisons have been made between this and Umberto Lenzi's Cannibal Ferox - but there is truly no comparison; the latter is just an outlandish gory fantasy; CH may scar you for life - I wish I'd never seen it; otherwise I wouldn't be writing this, trying to purge myself of its poison.",1217548800,4,659,4.454545454545454
2401861,4,B000B5Y0CS,"It's still a fantastic film. I think its important to state that this movie is really by comparison not the all out gore fest it is sometimes portrayed to be. The shock and horror stems more from the realism in which events such as impalement are shown. The Movie almost succeeds in its goal of appearing as an actual documentary however a few moments of bad acting disturb the illusion somewhat.  Yes their is animal cruelty however its no worse than the abuse suffered from countless animals everyday in slaughterhouses etc. At the very least the seven animals here were killed for someones artistic vision and were eaten instead of wasted like so many animals killed with no real purpose. Their is no need to condemn he film for this and even the filmmaker himself has said he regrets the decisions he made concerning the animals. All in all I would say that this is one of the most intelligent and realistic films of the exploitation era of film making. For a fan of the genre it is a most see, for the curious I would say know yourself before watching it is certainly not for those who do not appreciate a good splatter flick",1217030400,3,1130,4.512195121951219

We watched it and were not disappointed. But we were astounded as to how well the movie was made. This is not a ""horror"" film. Sure, it is gory and repulsive and shocking, but that is where the traditional horror element ends. The social commentary still holds true today and packs a punch. The ""civilized"" journalists are far more cruel and sadistic than the cannibals, and as a result they deserve everything that came to them. The commentary on news media's credability as well as the savage nature of man are all explored here. Would i watch this movie over and over again? Not at this age, but when I was 16 I may have watched it over and over for the sheer shock value.

2401883,4,B000B5Y0CS,"I will admit first of all that I am a ""Hardcore Horror Fan.""  That said, I would have to say that Cannibal Holocaust is not as bad as I had been led to believe.  It is shocking without a doubt.  Gory is also an affirmative.  However, the style of the film made me feel like this film was made for a purpose.  Modern civilization has repeatedly been nasty to less civilized culture in history.  Slavery would be a good example.  In Cannibal Holocaust we follow this Proffessor character as he uncovers the mystery of what happened to the missing Documentory Crew.  The Professor is a good character, and represents the ""good"" and enlightened aspect of modern society.  The missing film crew ends up representing the ignorant and hateful aspect of modern society.  I believe one review on the website stated that they did not know who's side to be on.  I truly felt that the ""cannibals"" did what they had to do.  I was on their side.  Without giving too much away, the crew did absolutely terrible things to the cannibals.  If the crew came to my house and did what they did to my family, nobody would blame me for doing the same.  The point is that I believe that Deodato had a vision with this film either on purpose or by accident.  I believe that this film is very well made and has an amazing amount of power.  However, I also believe that it should be watched responsibly and with an open mind.  I love horror, but I did not watch this film like a horror film.  I looked at the violence and gore as a very real and understandable way of life in some parts of the world.  I am certain that much worse occurs on this planet.",1214784000,2,1626,4.338870431893688

The actors were forced, at gunpoint, to disembowel a massive sea  turtle, shove a knife through a monkey's throat, and other horrific things that actually caused one of the actresses to lose her lunch on camera. The actors, once free from their ordeal, described the director as a ""madman"" and talked about the movie as though it were a hostage situation. The film includes real locals from the area, and fantastic human SFX, but the animal brutality is more suited for a Faces of Death movie. After filming, the director fled to Europe, and most will say he was only seen, anonymously,  in the film Hostel Part 2 as the cannibal fetishist. He was in the film, though stories circulate about him making films in Europe whilst incognito. The story is difficult to follow, sort of a pre-Blair Witch thing, but it's one of those films that everyone should see once, then put away and lend it to friends.

Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is easily one of the top 5 greatest and most important horror films ever made. What Deodato and company pulled off here is something that can't be replicated in this jaded, falsely cushioned & politically correct world of lies that we live in today. This film to me personally is the ultimate example of cinematic, artistic trickery. Over the years it has grown into one of the most sought after cult classic horror films and that in it self only adds to it's brilliance. While viewing ""Cannibal Holocaust"" you are assaulted with the feeling of impending doom, to the heights of which no other horror film since has been able to reach. The solid rock director invites the viewer to go on a rollercoaster ride through a hell on earth where down is up ,wrong is right and the line that is drawn between fiction and reality is simply wiped clean. This one is not for the faint of heart and if you're an avid animal rights activist or a vegetarian then don't even bother. Yes! There are real animals being killed right up in your face and there is nothing you can do about it except look away or watch. This is a truly offensive and disturbing film, but despite the reaction of it's critics it's these same controversial components that make the movie what it truly is and that is an exercise in exploring the core of human nature, it's fears and it's greed (Deodato's greed maybe?). I will admit when it comes to the animals being killed it's a hard subject and both sides of the argument have legitimate points. I myself won't try to deny my mixed feelings about the whole thing but I also know that these mixed feelings are exactly what Deodato was intending to tug on when he made the movie. All I know is without the real killings in the film the fake ones would not have been half as believable. Even some of the actors began to wonder of there own demise after witnessing the animals being butchered and how far Deodato was willing to go for the sake of cinema art & or a buck.  I'm speaking for myself as a meat eater though... I can not be a hypocrite and say whole heartedly that I believe it was morally wrong to sacrifice these animals for the sake of the film 'cause I don't believe it was totally wrong. If you think differently then don't watch the film! To me the killings were just as important to the whole of the film as the perfectly unpredictable score and cinematography. I believe Ruggero Deodato is a controversial filmmaker that made a film within a film about a group of controversial documentary filmmakers that walked well over the edge of sanity for the sake of greed disguised as art and in the process may or may not have stepped to far over the edge himself, but as a mindless horror film fan I feel the obligation to admire and respect the man and the film and at the same time be totally disgusted by it.",1206230400,3,2941,4.454545454545454

Italians in the 70's loved nothing more than to take a good idea and run with it. ""Go where the Lira is"" was a way of life for a good many directors of the time. Like Argento's The Bird With the Crystal Plumage (2-Disc Special Edition) started the Giallo craze before him, Deodato is credited with kick starting the cannibal film craze. For those who dig on the sleazy and shocking underbelly of international cinema this film was long considered one of the harder to find titles. Banned in numerous countries for graphic, mean-spirited animal cruelty and snuff allegations leveled at Deodato by the Italian Government, it was almost impossible to find an uncut copy of this film. Now, thanks to a renewed interest in all things of bad taste, it's re-packaged, uncut, and ready to disturb a whole new generation of sickos!

Beautifully shot, the sweeping, panoramic views of lush rainforest at the start of the film, coupled with a feel-good melody scored by Riz Ortolani(Mondo Cane)quietly lull the viewer into a feeling they are watching something educational on the Discovery Channel or maybe Mutual Of Omaha's Wild Kingdom instead of being plunged into a world of images and sounds so realistic and profoundly disturbing that some I've shown it to state that they were overcome with a sense on numbness and overwhelming desire to shower upon viewing it to completion.

Cannibal Holocaust follows N.Y.U. Anthropology Prof. Harold Monroe's rescue mission into the amazon rainforests in search of a lost American film crew.

Monroe takes off to the Amazon and meets up with his guides, Chaco and Miguel(a hard-case amazon expert and his assistant), and a hostage from a nearby tribe to use for negotiation upon meeting the natives. After hiking deep into the green inferno they happen upon a rock-wielding native brutally raping and murdering what turns out to be his wife. The good Prof. is informed that the muderer is a member of the Yacumo tribe and is merely serving out the punishment his people reserve for adulterers. Following the tribesman closely, the party confronts him and offers up their hostage in exchange for permission to enter the Yacumo Village.

Once in the little village, the rescue party is confronted with anger, fear and hostility, until Miguel wins them over with a little old fashioned bribery. It seems that the last white people to come thru had left the village in turmoil. The next morning, the Yacumo leads the group to the edge of their territory, where they meet the neighbors: the Yanomamo and Shamatari. Both flesh-eaters, the tribes are perpetually at war with each other. The team witnesses the death of a Yanomamo woman at the hands of a group of Shamatari warriors, and then follows the warriors to a riverbank where they encounter a large group of Shamatari's preparing to massacre some Yanomamo men. The rescue team steps in with superior fire-power and the Shamatari warriors are forced to retreat into the jungle in fear and confusion. In gratitude, the Yanomamo invite the group to join them in their village.

The Yanomamo village is unlike anything you'd imagine. An elabotate shelter system is built into large clumps of trees, giving the place an overwhelming sense of malice and instilling in the un-initiated a sense of zenophobia. They quickly find that the same rules seem to apply here as in the Yacumo village...Don't Trust Whitey. In a bizarre attempt to gain some trust from the natives Prof. Monroe goes skinny-dippin in the river. Soon he's surrounded by brown skinned Yanomamo girls frolicking nakedly and playfully pinching at the good Professors johnson. When the bath-time fun ends, the small group of naked amazonians leads Monroe to a crude shrine made from the bones of the missing film crew. Prof. Malones worst fears are confirmed upon seeing the decayed remains of the Americans, but within them lies an unexpected bounty...Film Cans! Frustrated and angry at the brutality and viciousness the documentary team obviously experienced prior to their demise, Monroe confronts the tribe in their village and shows them the power of ""White Man's Magic"" by playing a tape recorder for them. Under the magical spell of the tape recorder, the leader of the Yanomamo trades the shiny film cans for the powerful, speaking box.

This is pretty much the end of the part of the film I like to call ""The RIGHT WAY To Interact With the Natives"", and the beginning of the ""How NOT to conduct Yourselves while filming in Amazonia"" part of the film...

Fresh from his arrival back in the states, Monroe is approached by executives of the Pan American Broadcast Company and they offer him the job of hosting the airing of the lost filmaker's documentary. The good Prof. states that he will only consider it if he can view the lost footage beforehand to see it for himself. The suits agree, and show him a short segment from one of the lost team's previous documentaries, The Last Road to Hell to get him up to date on the lost teams work. After the viewing, an executive tells him that the documentary was staged by the director Alan Yates to acquire more exciting footage. Puzzled, Monroe continues on to view the footage he himself fought so hard to recover from the Amazon.

The first film reel begins by showing the group preparing for their newest expedition. Joking, slap-assing, and playfully teasing each other in a way that illustrates the tight-knit unit that a documentary film crew often evolves into. The sight of a naked Faye drying herself non-chalantly, and barely registering any anger when she is teased by other crew members only strengthens the idea that these people are friends as well as co-workers.

Upon landing in the Amazon, Yates and his crew begin their journey into the ""Green Inferno"" and death and destruction are almost immediate.  While making camp on the first night, the viewer gets a glimpse of what's in store as they witness the male members of the film crew(with the help of Felipe the guide)capture a gigantic turtle in the river and systematically destroy it under the guise of preparing a meal. The joking manner and adolescent way the western men toy with the decapitated and flayed-alive turtles still spastic head gives a glimpse into the true character of those in front of the lens.  While the men prop the turtle head in front of the camera to film its futile gasps, Faye, the lone female on the trek gets sick at the sight and sulks along the riverbank in(soon to be hypocritical)protest of the poor reptiles treatment.

During the next days trek, Felipe is bitten on the foot by a poisonous snake. After killing the snake on camera, Jack cuts off Felipes leg in a futile attempt to save him from the poison. Quickly and painfully, Felipe dies. The crew buries him in a shallow grave, and argues about going forward with the filming faced with no guide. The film team decides to continue and in no time at all stumble into a small group of Yacumo standing in a clearing. While the tribesmen are in the open, Jack takes aim and shoots one in the leg with the idea of easily following the wounded tribesman back to his village, and hopefully, some great footage.

As the projectionist changes reels, Prof. Monroe voices his disapproval of the team's actions to the executives, stating that there are easier and better ways to introduce yourself to the natives.

When the second reel starts, the group is just arriving at the village. They descend on the villagers in a swarm of fire and gunshots, quickly herding terrified villagers into a large hut and burning it down to stage a scene for their documentary: the evil cannibal Yanomamos brutal burning alive of the Yacumo. After the fires, one of the crew shoots a baby pig in the head and watches as it slowly dies a suddering, pathetic death, while Alan and Faye make love in front of a large group of captured villagers.

Monroe breaks in with concerns about the films authenticity seeing firsthand that most of the footage is faked, but the executives ignore him and babble about how groundbreaking the documentary will be. They plan to air it without watching the rest and adjourn for the day. The following morning Mr. Monroe continues to view the reels alone, and in horror watches as a pregnant Yacumo woman has her fetus forcibly removed and buried in a muddy riverbank. Knowing that the executives are still planning to air the documentary having only glimpsed a taste of whats truly on there and hoping to change their minds, he decides to invite the suits to watch some un-edited footage that only he's seen.

The final two reels contain images of the film crews brutal gang rape of a young Yanomamo girl and subsequent fall-out with the natives..
The glee and animal behavior of the men during the rape is countered by Faye's furious(but ultimatly useless)attempts to stop them. The final reel begins with the group arriving at a site where the same poor girl is clumsily impaled on a pole(the image most associated with this film). The crew slowly circles the girl on a stick while describing the atrocity as an ""Obscure Sexual Rite"" of the Yanomamo Tribe. Shortly after leaving the site of the impalement, the team is attacked by pissed off tribesmen seeking some serious payback for the girls horrific death. Jack the cameraman is stuck with a spear in the ensuing attack, and instead of trying to help, Alan decides to shoot him and film the natives torture of his buddy. They sit and watch as Jack is systematically emasculated, cut into pieces and consumed by the ash coved savages. Faye is captured by the Yanomamo after jacks demise and Alan forces Mark the soundman to go back with him to try and save her. The two sneak up on the Yanomamos and film from the bushes as the tribesmen each take turns raping Faye before chopping her head off. The remaining two members of the team are quickly found hiding in the bush and chased by screaming tribesmen before first Mark, and finally Alan both fall victim to their own bad deeds. The film reel flaps to an end as the final image of Alan's lifeless and bloody face falls in front of the discarded camera. The executives sit in shocked silence as Monroe walks away, finally in the end, one of them orders the film to be burned.

It's been said that Cannibal Holocaust's ""found footage"" premise was in part the inspiration for The Blair Witch Project, and after viewing both titles, I'd have to agree. While wholly different films, the core premise of both is that someone got lost in the woods/jungle with a movie camera...bad stuff happened, here's what they filmed.",1200960000,15,10809,4.789699570815451
2401917,5,B000B5Y0CS,"I have heard so much about this 2005 controversial movie that I had to see it for myself.  So many Amazon buddies have recommended it and warned me as I am an animal lover.  If you prefer, this particular DVD has, in addition, an animal cruelty free version

This movie is definitely not for everyone.  I however, was not scared one bit.  Bottom line is (like it or hate it) this is a South American tribe's culture to perform what we ""civilized"" people think is grotesque and sadistic as portrayed in this movie.  Given that, I, more or less viewed, it as documentary style, even though it is not a documentary.  My father was a photojournalist, took photos in many parts of the world and told me about different cultures of people that are, to us, very weird.

The movie is about a professor that goes to the jungles of South America to look for a group of missing young journalists---3 men and a woman.  The professor's group encounters the Yacumo and the Yanomamo tribes, the latter one being friendly.  He finds the remains of the group and the film footage and brings it back to view.

Warning!  There were actual scenes of animal killings---muscrat, turtle, monkey and a little pig, which I believe the director could have used props and special effects to achieve the same results.  This film was actually made in 1985, not the 1960s!  Then there was the very bloody footage of the 4 young journalists, who thought they were invincible, succumbing to the wilds of the Yacumo tribe---rape and mutilation, gore at its best.

I did, however, like this film---it told a very brutal story very well.  It was not scary to me---Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween (the original) had far more of a ""fright"" impact on me.  So I'm not sure I would call this horror, just gore.  See this with a warning...",1200700800,4,1804,4.601880877742946
2401918,4,B000B5Y0CS,"I remember the controversy when this flick was shown back then on local theaters. I never forgot the film's title, gruesome as it is catchy. Well, to me horror and gore films are like riding roller coasters, the more terror and thrill inducing, the better. I sure don't watch expecting the next Citizen Kane (although Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street ARE classics).

For 'its type', this is a good movie. It is gory and exploitative (with even nudity never wasted if male or female actors had the hotbod).

Pluses are the shlocky 'banquets' and even the soundtrack. Some scenes are gratuitiously cruel, inserted to appeal to baser interests but, again, this is no Clint Eastwood vehicle. And these things CAN be cathartic, you know.

Anyway, are you really, really looking for an eye shutting (or covering) and/or head away turning celluloid experience? Look no further.",1200441600,2,875,4.97945205479452
2401919,5,B000B5Y0CS,"The other review for this movie did not give an insight to this movie. I bought it anyways and im glad I did because its now out of stock. The movie is said to be The Most Controversial Movie Ever Made! I found it not be that shocking because movies always try to raise the bar. However, I did enjoy the movie. It showed a guy filming his voyage then cut to a office and then they watch the film with the four filmmakers. I don't know how it happened but oh well. The final forty minutes are very realistic and brutal. It shows the filmmakers destroying a village and then the villagers take revenge on them. It does contain scenes of rape, animal killings, and cannibalism. It was a good movie and very surreal. I wouldnt really call it a horror movie because this stuff really happens in other countrys and does look real. Maybe its so controversial because it says something about humans and what we do for revenge.",1200355200,4,918,4.374269005847953
2401920,5,B000B5Y0CS,"""In 1979 four documentary filmmakers disappeared in the jungles of South America while shooting a film about cannibalism...Six months later their footage was found...""When their film-reels are found, they are brought back to the U.S., TV executives in New York City want to see if the documentary footage is suitable enough for public viewing. As they see through the eyes of the filmmakers on their parrellous adventure searching for the much rumored cannibal tribes, along the way they eventually find them, but they didn't get quite what they hoped for, instead they end up getting maimed, raped, killed and eaten alive.

A devestating and unique Italian-Columbian made horror flick that is the ultimate movie of it's subgenre! banned and censored in almost every country, this movie has been called the most controversial movie ever made next to ""Caligula"". The film came out in Italy in 1980, it became a minor success for a week until the authorities arrested director Ruggero Deoato and his filmmaking crew thinking that they actually murdered the actors. During the trial, the actors appeared in court to prove no one was actually killed in the filming of the movie, the film was banned in Italy for 4 years until in 1984 it was finally re-issued. There's alot of graphic imagery and violence throughout the picture especially towards real live animals such as a Raccoon-like creature getting gutted alive with a pocket knife, a monkey having the top of it's skull sliced off with a machete and a large river turtle dismembered and gutted alive.

The film has a very documentary-like feel to it and almost feels like a semi-snuff film! It's not for everybody but if you have a strong stomach then this is a must see if your into Italian horror movies and you'll definitely see why it inspired ""The Blair Witch Project"". The CD soundtrack by the film's composer Riz Ortolani is very good especially the memorable theme score with some emotion put through the tracks like the depressing ""Crucified Woman"" and the more upbeat jazzy-like track called ""Drinking Coco"", the soundtrack is a must have for serious horror soundtrack collectors. The 2-Disc Grindhouse DVD has some fantastic extras like audio commentaries, a documentary, interviews, hidden easter eggs especially a secret trailer for the legendary ""Debbie Does Dallas"" if you can find it, poster-and-still gallery, music video and trailers.",1199664000,2,2405,5.086075949367088
2401921,1,B000B5Y0CS,"I'm sure that I'll get attacked viciously for this, but what the hell. This movie is terrible in so many ways that finding a starting point is difficult in itself.

For starters, the acting is so bad (even for a B movie) that it's impossible to be lured into this world because of the horrible performances. I think that part of a great film is how the actors convince you that this is all happening, there are many films in this genre that contain ""believable"" performances without having ""heavy"" actors in them. After viewing the film, I can understand why Ruggero had to resort to this inept bunch of monkeys to split the so-called acting duties, because NO serious actor would go near this train wreck with a gas mask, helmet, face-guard or 1000-foot pole.

The concept of watching real animals slaughtered for audience entertainment is horrifying. These animals were not given humane deaths, instead they are butchered so callously and brutally, one has to wonder what kind of sick, screwed up sicko Ruggero Deodato really is. Apparently he made some B.S. claim about how these animals were subsequently eaten by tribesmen and NOT wasted. Who cares? Great filmmakers have studied brutally for decades and didn't need to resort to sensational tactics to get their point across.

The footage of the professor going back to the ""Green Hell"" was probably the least annoying part of the film, although still heavily trenched in crap acting and infantile dialogue.

Now, the really juicy stuff! The documentarians. I understand the depiction of those who manipulate information to make it more visceral. I understand the concept of not believing every thing you see or hear on TV or in the news. I understand how destructive man is! Having said that, this group of ""documentarians"" has to be unequivocally the biggest joke depiction of whatever Ruggero considers to be embodiment of the ""hypocritical man"". Going back to my initial criticism of the acting, these are by far some of the worst actors in the history of thespians. They almost revel in their ""mediocrity"". The problem is how absurd their actions are even for the sake of showing something sensational. I absolutely DO NOT believe that student filmmakers would set fire to a small village, killing and raping the people just for exciting video footage. The main character, Alan Yates, is the kind of guy you would take pleasure in beating the hell out of over a period of 10 weeks. He's an absolute moron (and did I mention a really crappy actor?). His girlfriend, wife or whatever the hell it is, is quite possibly even worse. She's a total one-dimensional cardboard cutout, the most annoying type of woman you would ever want to meet, and quite obviously sicker than all of the guys she's surrounded by as she not only condones the heinous violence these idiots commit, she joins in on it. I find it very hard to digest that a ""supposedly"" intelligent woman, who apparently is sane and in possession of common sense, would allow such horrible acts to be perpetrated on these defenseless people. It's utterly unbelievable and repugnant. As for the other two melon-headed documentarians, well, what more can I say... ""We'll get an Oscar for sure"", ahhh, no, actually, you won't!

In the end, I suppose Ruggero set it up so that you want these people to be killed. I still can't help but think that maybe there's another way to do it. There are plenty of grizzly horror movies out there that amp up the violence and heighten the sense of reality in over the top ways that still create the desired effect. Horror movies should be about excess, freaking people out and flat out bloody violence. As well, great acting has never been a pre-requisite for horror movies, nor is believable topic matter, but for crying out loud, at least films like Zombie, Deep Red, Suspiria, The Beyond (I've listed fellow Italian directors for the sake of continuity) have a sense of entertainment and intelligence, coupled with a sense of craft and dignity. Cannibal Holocaust has neither; it's utter exploitation without any of the perks.

In the end, Ruggero Deodato has committed the worst kind of artistic crime, mediocrity masked as expression. The biggest problem with dross like this is how it gets smeared with sycophantic accolades and so drenched in controversy that young buffoonish directors like Eli Roth parade around thinking it's a masterpiece and perpetuate the lineage of this kind of rubbish.",1199232000,14,4451,4.888741721854305
2401922,5,B000B5Y0CS,"I went into Cannibal Holocaust expecting it to have very little dignity, and a whole lot of shocking gore and violence. However, what I saw was quite the opposite: The gore was just as bad as any other movie, except for in the very end, and this movie actually had a very powerful message, and alot of artistic integrity. It seems like it soars over alot of other reviewer's heads, although it's pretty obvious. With scenes like two of the adventurers having sex right after they massacre a peaceful tribe, and one of them cracking a smile at seeing a native impaled on a stake, it becomes clear that there really are no ""civilized"" characters in the movie.

I highly reccomend it, not to those who expect to see an over the top gorefest, but those looking for a very powerful although not scary horror movie.",1199145600,14,809,4.541095890410959
2401957,5,B000B5Y0CS,"After always being on the look out for the most disturbing and shocking movies that really attempt to push the envelope, I stumbled upon Cannibal Holocaust on the advice of a friend.  To this day it remains the most graphic movie that I have ever seen.  I have a very macabre sense of humor and enjoy dark and disturbing slasher films that leave nothing to the imagination, but to this day I have never found any other movie that is like Cannibal Holocaust... and I challenge anyone to find another movie that is so disturbing and unforgettable.

I remember that my graduate school roommate and I ate Pizza during this movie, but she couldn't bear to eat while watching this after a while.  To this day whenever we watch a modern horror flick, we always comment on  the fact that post-Cannibal Holocaust, most contemporary movies (i.e. Hostel, House of 1,000 Corpses, SAW) pale in comparison with respect to their levels of gore, violence, and sheer horror.  Albeit simple, the soundtrack in this film is fairly disturbing and has an enormous effect on the visuals.

In sum, while this movie may be somewhat 'old,' there is still nothing out there that tops it in terms of sheer brutality and unadulterated violence.  There is a message at the end of this movie relating to the impact on western civilization on indigenous cultures--which many people will miss/ignore--but it is there nonetheless.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of this genre and who wants to see the movie that is the be all end all of macabre cinematography.",1198281600,3,1550,4.732342007434944
2401958,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust is one of the most convincing ""snuff"" films ever, although its not really a snuff film. Some of the special effects scenes in this are scenes that other s.e artists to this day try to recreate but to no success. The effects were so convincing that it was band in many countries! The most amazing aspect of the movie consists of the cast, a real life cannibal tribe! Its completely amazing how the director was able to have these tribesmen act accordingly. This is a underground classic for the hardcore horror fan!",1196985600,2,533,4.680851063829787

Is it everything it says it is on the new DVD packaging? YES. My only gripe was the senseless animal killing. So if you're big into animal rights, there are 2 scenes that will make you quite angry. It is also easy to see where movies like Blair Witch took ideas from. I have pretty much seen it all. 2/3 of my DVD collection is horror or sci-fi and this takes the cake. Considering when this film was made, it has effects that rival or beat a lot of what is out now. I don't think this is one I will watch often, but I got through it. The bonus dvd is quite good with a bunch of features as well.",1194048000,3,771,3.8860759493670884
2401961,3,B000B5Y0CS,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" is neither the film its most ardent admirers nor its disgusted detractors take it to be.  A grisly exploitation shocker with much about it to regret, it achieves at times considerable force and shows definite signs of conscious artistry, but hardly competes, either emotionally or viscerally, with the likes of ""Straw Dogs"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"", to name two masterworks of its era that meditate much more fully upon the brutality of individuals and their societies.

  To address the animal cruelty heads-up:  undoubtedly it would be a better world if Deodato had not chosen to slaughter these animals gratuitously for this film, and the film would not, in my judgment, suffer for having spared real animal life.  However, I feel that we should remember that, in this same filmmaking era, serious accusations were made against the likes of Kurosawa and Cimino for brutalizing the horses of ""Kagemusha"" and ""Heaven's Gate"", while reports and documentaries captured the very serious dangers that extras were exposed to during the making of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Fitzcarraldo"", the latter of which hazarded the lives of dozens of jungle-dwelling extras by the madly driven Werner Herzog.  Auteurs, real or self-described, took a lot upon themselves in this period, and we can be thankful that in that respect, at least, the opening ""disclaimer"" is not entirely unfounded.

  Now then-- ""Cannibal Holocaust"", I'm afraid, is done in by its ambitious structure.  The opening ""television"" scene is a satirical hoot, rendered all the more delicious by the dubbing.  Deodato's impressionistic glances at the NYC skyline ominously render it as a kind of steel jungle, and we are well primed to find out just what those ""four fearless young Americans"" were all about.  But the film's entire 1st act, with Professor Monroe heading in on their trail, is a huge let-down.  The whole saga sags terribly, and is only made worse by Deodato's misplaced decision to throw what is arguably the film's ugliest scene of (pretend) violence on the viewer early.  We witness a display of porno-Sadean pseudo-anthropologic violence, the ritual murder-by-dildo of an adulteress, by the muddy banks of a truly Stygian river.  This hellish act, made all the more terrible since it appears to be the only violent deed in the film which fills its perpetrator with remorse, is, if justified in representation, still misplaced in the film.  Imagine if it were captured instead as part of ""The Green Inferno"", perhaps helping to drive the diabolical documentarians on in their crimes?  As it is, I fear Deodato didn't want all the ""yummy"" bits of the film to be caught on the scratched-up documentary footage-- this scene is filmed therefore with a chilly kind of detachment that is unnerving, yes, but blatantly exploitative.

  A representational problem of another sort plagues the notorious turtle-killing scene.  The actors faces tell the whole sad story of their own revulsion over this, which should have told Deodato this was a mistake.  Are we to believe that the same characters who become stone-faced over the dismembered turtle can conduct a gang-rape as though it were a fraternity prank?  It might be one thing if the film were charting a progression to insanity or dehumanization on the part of these characters, but this is not ""Apocalypse Now"" we're watching.  Psychologically, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is an EC comic:  these little rats fooled the world, but they were amoral little rotters and, by god, they got what they deserved.

  If too much of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" drags, the 1-2-3 finale, alas, may be a bit underdeveloped.  Francesca Ciardi's callous reaction to the rape of the tribal girl ('You're wasting film!  We're not making a porno!') is a brilliantly ugly satirical swipe in a film whose great merit may be that, yes, it can impact your thinking about the media! (the dvd's spurious credits for these young shockumentarians gives them dubious appelations like 'anti-war activist', 'animal rights advocate' and 'feminist'!).  Still, one wishes Deodato would try to provide SOME motivation:  are we really to believe the director would rape an underage girl under the nose of his fiancee?  What, even in his dastardly evil little head, could he be thinking?  And then the film jumps immediately to the infamous impalement shot, which makes me wonder whether we are to question if the filmmakers decided to take their own shot at an ""authentic"" cannibal brutality (I mean the gang of four, not Deodato!!)-- and then they are cornered and picked off in the grisly denoument.  While this finale has an undoubted ghastly impact, it would work better as horror if we had a little more sense of cause-and-effect in terms of their encirclement.

  But then, so much of ""Cannibal Holocaust"", especially at the end, depends upon how mindful we are of what the ""camera"" is doing-- what is he thinking behind it as he films his pals, his fiancee being brutalized and devoured.  Does he really think he'll still make it out?  Is he at a loss for anything else to do, so instinctual is his voyeurism?  Is he titillated by the horrors he records?  Does he take some paroxysm of masochistic narcissistic delight in capturing his own dying mug?  Such are the grisly questions ""Cannibal Holocaust"" poses.  But it could have done these, and other things, more effectively if it had tried a little more drama and focused less on simple shock.  And the turtle could have lived.",1194048000,5,5475,5.026637069922309

2401963,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust what can I say that has not already been said about this classic.  You know your in for a good movie when the movie in question is still being banned in countries to this day.  Everything you have heard about this movie is true, and the movie has had a troublsome history and upon it's release it landed Deodato in jail, and even gained him alot of enemies but in the long run it solidified Deodato as one of the greats.

This is the holy grail of the cannibal movies, there is no other that comes close, this a tough movie to take in I have shown it to friends who watched a couple of moments of it and than left the room due to disgust, I can handle the gore element very well but there were some parts of the movie I had a tough time with.  Before going into viewing the film you really have to go in with an open mind, and you have to metally prepare for what you are going to see.

I would like to point out that The Blair With Project blatantly ripped this movie off.  Cannibal Holocaust tells the story of a group of reporters who go down to the amazon to document cannibalism, and mysteriously end up missing.  Another doctor soon travels down not to long after to investigate the dissapearance the doctor soon learns the truth as to what exactly happened, he also has to go through some test to gain the trust of the cannibal tribes in doing so he obtains the footage the crew members shot while down their, the footage also holds the key to the truth.  What ensues is horror history, if you want more you'll just have to see it for yourself.

The movie is not uncut as stated on the box, there is still one scene that is missing and that scene is one of the most infamous scenes in horror history, the scene is question is the piranha scene where a member of a cannibal tribe get's his leg cut off, and than he gets fed to the piranhas.  There is alot of debate saying the scene exists (on vhs versions) and there are people who say it does not exsist.  There is a photo on the internet showing a picture of the scene.  People who say the scene does not exsist say that the scene was hard to shoot, as they could not control the piranha, and they had a malfunctioning underwater camera.

Before the movie was released there was alot of talk going around that the piranha scene was going to be restored upon the intial release date nothing was there.  More talk started that the scene is hidden on the disc as an easter egg, again it was never discovered.  However there is something intresting on the disc in one of the easter eggs, it shows Deodato anwsering questions on the movie, someone asks him about the piranha scene, Deodato get's extremely upset and storms out ending the segment.  I personally spoke with Sage Stallone (I am not name droping either) who runs Grindhouse Releasing on the issue, and he really did not go into to much detail but he told me that the scene was a headache for everyone invovled.

Scene or no scene this is hands down the ultimate version of Cannibal Holocaust, also included with the disc is a nice poster from the film it is also a 2 disc set with both discs including tons of extras and various easter eggs hidden through out both discs.  Although be prepared to be shocked when you open the case up as you will see a picture of a vary graphic scene from the movie.  Cannibal Holocaust is my favorite movie of all time and every time I see it it makes me proud to wear my Cannibal Holocaust t-shirt.  Hopefully you enjoy this movie as much as I have as well as others!!",1193184000,4,3539,4.27736131934033
2401964,4,B000B5Y0CS,"I first became aware of this film while shopping in the mall not too long ago. I was instantly intrigued after reading the quote ""The Most Controversial Movie Ever Made"", and reading about how it was banned in most countries for so long, and the filmmakers nearly went to jail over it!! But I didn't buy it then, one reason was it 35 bucks!!! So, I found it on here and bought it for $25. First off, I'm a huge horror fan, and the more blood,guts and gore, the better. Nevertheless, there's more to horror than mindless gore, there has to be some substance. So going into this movie, I wasn't expecting this film to be that great, cause most movies don't live up to the hype. And after watching it, I must say that I'm at least, in part, correct with this assumption. Now let me just say, this is by no means a horrible movie, in the sense of basic plot and exposition. One complaint that I do have, is that it took too long to get to the actual part of the film were the recovered footage is being viewed. And yes, the Blair Witch Project did ""borrow"" from this film to a certain extent!! The acting could have been some better, but its not horrible by any means. But I suppose that the real reason that this movie is such a cult classic is not for its acting, but for its straight-forward brutality and violence. I've read reviews about this movie, people saying that they were deeply bothered and disturbed by it and all that. From my perspective, this film really didn't bother me. In fact, I was somewhat disappointed. From the way the cover of the DVD read, and the reviews by fans and critics alike, I was expecting something far worse. I must admit, however, that I was surprised in the fact that REAL animals were used in the making of this film. This was the main reason that got some of the people involved with the film in legal trouble. So note to any animal lover, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU!!! lol Though I think I did notice an option on the DVD to view the movie with the animal violence cut out. Anyway, the other effects in the film were great too, especially for the time it was made. The film was filmed in a ""real time"" sense, which made the film even more effective. Yes, this movie has pretty much everything..nudity, rape, extreme violence/gore, animal cruelty, etc. And for someone who's not used to seeing that kind of stuff in films, I can understand how this movie may upset people. But with all that said, I don't think its as ""controversial"" as people tend to think. Maybe its because I've seen a lot of gory and violent films, and it takes a lot to bother me. However, I have to tip my hat, cause I really haven't ever seen a film quite like this one before. Now, as far as the DVD goes, there are a lot of special features with this one. It includes a director's commentary, interviews from cast members, an hour and a half documentary (In Italian, but subtitled) about the making of the film, filmographies and biographies of the actors/director, poster art and still gallery, as well as digital restoration of audio/video of the film itself. And though, I was expecting something more horrific than I got (though it does rank up there on my list), I still really liked this film. It was done well, filmed very effectively, and like I said, the effects were great. So if you're a hardcore fan of horror and don't mind seeing in-your-face violence and brutality, this one's for you. And to the squeamish, the animal rights activist, or just the casual movie watcher..stay away!! Though, I must say that everyone should watch this one at least once before they die!!!

It has poor attempts to create shock factor by killing animals cruely.  This movie had a ton of dialouge and very little GORE.  Yes, very little gore.  You freaks who think that this movie is gory need to get a life.  It's just STUPID.  I found this to be filled with absurdity, rape, and fake animal endtrails portrayed as human remains, WOW, NOT!  Thankfully I only paid 8.00 for this pile of junk.  I'd have been TICKED if I paid Amazon's price of 20.00.

2401987,5,B000B5Y0CS,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" showed up in the mail this week and as I got into the movie I found myself wondering why this was in my queue, and then I remembered.  In some online discussion regarding the relative merits of the torture-porn films that are presenting themselves as the cutting edge of contemporary horror cinema, there was a consensus of sorts among those who had seen ""Cannibal Holocaust"" that this was the film that would get you if you had never been gotten by a horror film.  By that standard, this 1980 film delivers as promised.  The advertisements for this film back then lauded it as the movie that goes all the way, and most viewers will agree that is indeed the case.  For some that will be the gruesome deaths of some of the native women and for others it will be what happens to the turtle.  What it probably will not be is the death of the faux documentary film crew, because what you see pretty much convinces you that they get what is coming to them.

Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) is persuaded to go to the jungles of the Amazon and lead the search for a missing documentary film crew that consists of director Alan Yates (Gabriel Yorke), his girlfriend and script girl Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi), and their friends cameramen Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Barbareschi).  Monroe travels to the rainforest and in the first half of the film is eventually able to recover the equipment and footage taken by the missing team.  The second half of the film takes place back in New York City where the Pan American Broadcast Company wants Monroe to host the broadcast of the found footage.  However, Monroe insists on seeing all of the footage first and is informed that Yates and his crew were award-winning documentarians who often staged their most exciting footage.  In that context we see both the footage the network wants to air and that which they did not want Monroe to see.  The footage proves to be shockingly graphic and reveals not only what happened to Yates and the others, but why.

Yes, I can appreciate that the people who came up with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" probably saw this film.  You do have the whole bit about a documentary film crew disappearing and finding the film that reveals what happens to them, but in the end ""Blair Witch"" proved to be almost a shaggy dog story, because you never really see anything, and that is most certainly not the case with ""Cannibal Holocaust.""  What gave ""Blair Witch"" its power was that it was constantly giving the audience cinematic clues that something was about to happen, without getting to that moment.  Essentially the audience is as taunt as can be for over an hour while watching that film.  ""Cannibal Holocaust"" gives you amply opportunity to lose your lunch, and the film of recent vintage that I was remind of more was ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vacancy/dp/B000RGN2JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vacancy</a>,"" specifically the snuff films that we see on the videos on the television (and which are a bonus feature on the DVD).  Both have the same grainy, cinema veritie quality, and both produce disquiet because of their style as well as their substance.

I know that I came across this film because it was mentioned as being superior to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Creek/dp/B000EOTVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Creek</a>,"" and other torture-porn films, but clearly it is more of an exploitation film than a horror film.  I am also old enough to remember ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mondo-Cane/dp/B0001FGBWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mondo Cane</a>,"" which they actually showed us in high school, and clearly ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is in that tradition.  It has been three decades since I saw ""Mondo Cane"" and I still remember the guy with the machete decapitating the bull, people eating insects, and the Oscar nominated song ""More.""  However, nothing in that film compares to what happens when the ""documentarians"" drag a turtle from the river in the scene that could make you eject the film from your DVD player before it is even half over.  This becomes the most disquieting scene in the film because it is totally real.  What happens to the human beings in this film might look real, and Ruggero Deodato was actually accused of making a snuff film (he made his actors sign contracts to ""disappear"" for a year to maintain the illusion they were real people who were killed and not just actors), but it is all faked, albeit in an extremely effective manner.

While I am convinced ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is rightfully considered an exploitation film rather than a horror film, the harder question to graphic with is whether it should also be considered social commentary.  The documentary film crew goes to the Amazon rainforests to show the barbarity of these cannibal tribes, but it is the Americans who are revealed to be the monsters.  Is this social criticism or a convenient excuse for all the blood and gore?  After all, when Monroe goes to South America he sees evidence of how brutal the natives can be when he sees a man punishing to death is wife for adultery.  It is telling that what happens to Yates and the others does not bother us as much as the atrocities these supposedly civilized people inflict on the ""cannibals.""  The conclusion of the film ultimately convinces me that the social criticism aspects are just to allow Deodato to get away with the blood and gore.  This film might be in a class by itself as an exploitation film, but that is what it is in the end, and by that standard it belongs on the dubious A-list that exists for such movies.

""Cannibal Holocaust"" is an unforgettable film, which might be why some of you will never want to see it, and hopefully those of you who need to be warned have been.  This 2-disc DVD certainly tries to defend, if not explain, its place in the history of exploitation cinema.  There is a commentary track and a different on camera commentary version of the film, so you can just listen to Deodato or you can watch him watch the film and listen to him.  There is an Animal Cruelty-Free Version of the film that you can see, but while I can understand wanting to refrain from seeing the turtle scene ever again, it is, of course, impossible to judge ""Cannibal Holocaust"" on its own terms if you see an edited version (even if the deletions reflect the regrets of the director and others for having included them in the first place).  The shooting script is also available as a DVD-Rom extra so that you can see how much ""worse the film could have been.""  ""Inside the Green Inferno"" continues the conceit with title card the biographies of the filmmakers, the search team, the three cannibal tribes, and an alternative version of ""Last Road to Hell,"" the film-within-the-film viewed by Professor Monroe before he goes off in search of the lost documentarians.",1188864000,7,7260,5.133276740237691
2401988,1,B000B5Y0CS,"Even if you cut the sadistic and immoral animal kill/torture scenes from this turkey, this video would be unwatchable for several reasons. The premise is weak, actors subpar, the soundtrack sounds more 1950's than 1970's. Worse, there is very lttle suspense, it's basic filler material of a group traveling through the rain forest and the ""meat"" in this malnourishing stew are a few scenes of gore, some with real and live animals.
I love my prime rib rare. I don't care about how Mr. Chicken makes his way into my frying pan. However I don't appreciate cowards killing helpless creatures as a substitute for good gore FX or suspenseful filmmaking.",1188518400,15,648,4.9
2401989,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Let me just say this. This movie goes over the limits of any horror movie i've ever seen, and then some.  The realism of this film is terrifying, the aspect is disturbing, and the special effects are great.  At some points in the movie, you think it's very interesting, and at other points you try to find out why on earth your watching it.  This film is also very draining, which I found very unique for a horror movie.  After you watch this, the images of it stick in your mind.  You basically feel like your mind was raped.  This film is DEFINATELY NOT for the weak at heart. I have a very strong stomach when it comes to horror movies, and this even made me squirm.  From animal cruelty, to rape, to forced abortion, this film's every aspect will have a great effect on your mind.  Forget what you ever thought about films.  This may be the first horror movie to ACTUALLY go over the limits.  Enjoy it, if you dare to watch it, and let the nightmarish thoughts kick in...",1188259200,10,975,4.3076923076923075
2401990,3,B000B5Y0CS,"I've heard a lot about this movie over the years and tonight I saw it for the first time.  It is not an enjoyable horror film at all and I will probably never watch it again, the graphic disturbing images and sequences stick with the person long after viewing it.  Now, this could be taken as a compliment being were talking about horror film.

If your into horror and heard of this and are on the fence about seeing it let me give you a heads up of what you'll see.  Brutal, humiliating, and degrading rape scenes filmed at length.
Killing of animals again filmed at length one of a large turtle who's little legs flap around as he is mutilated and killed in an exploitive way.  Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the infamous turtle scene, which is kind of comforting.  A cute monkey has the top of his head cut off and then the natives drink it's brains, another starts eating its face in a corner which we get a close up of.  Originally, Deodato had a fake monkey head with fake brains in it to have the natives eat instead of actually killing and eating a monkey. The natives talked him out of it, however, as monkey brains were a delicacy to them.  Also there were two takes needed so two monkeys were killed.  That's just nameing a couple of the animals killed.
I am not a hypocrite and I do eat meat and in the same situation in the woods to survive I would kill an animal.  I also realize there are a lot more disturbing things in the world like the war in Iraq and other such things, and I'm not a member of Peta.  However this is a film, so real animals did not need to be killed and in such brutal ways.  The turtle scene made me sick.
There is another scene where a baby fetus is basically ripped from this natives womb as she is standing, then bloody baby umbilical cord and all are tossed in a muddy hole and dirt is kicked over it.

The Internet Movie Database trivia says  ""Though uncaring towards the nature of his film during shooting, Ruggero Deodato now regrets everything he did, mostly the actual animal killings. He said once that he wishes now that he never made the movie.""  I believe my point is made if the director himself wishes he hadn't done this.

The movie is trying to say something and has a message if it wasn't and there was no message then I'd hate this film and find it pointless.  It is said that  Deodato was inspired to make the movie after seeing his son watching the violent news on TV, and thinking about how the journalists focus on the violence.  I'd agree the news is violent and that statement rings true today as it did when the film was made and probably every decade before and since.  Another film that tackled the media was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000CNESU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;by the great Sidney Lumet which is on Afi's top 100 films of all time and has reached much more audiences to get it's point across, so I'd say more effective.

As for the Blair Witch Project yes in both movies filmmakers go into a wooded area that never come out and there footage was found.  However they have totally different plots.  Cannibal Holocaust uses horrible images to make the viewer sick whereas The Blair Witch Project leaves it up to your imagination, both are effective.  However I would say what you don't see is almost always scarier, leaving it to your imagination.  Although with Cannibal Holocaust I don't really see your imagination making it anymore brutal.  This movie to me was more disgusting, disturbing and brutal, then scary.
Also what horror film hasn't in some way consciously or subconsciously been influenced by others.  Nearly any movie you point out, you could think of something that had that in it or was influenced in some way by another film.  I mean it's a compliment to call a film Hitchockian.

The movie is well made and the transfer looked really good also the sound and the score were very effective.

If someone asked me to recommend something disturbing or disgusting and something that pushes the envelope, as i did, then this would be the film.  If you want to be shocked or are a huge fan of gore and like being grossed out, or a fan of slowing down when there is an accident on the other side of the highway (which i'm not) to get a glimpse of carnage this is for you.  However, I'm not insinuating that everyone who likes this would enjoy seeing a car crash.

I debated on what to give this movie for a rating and tried to be biased.  I didn't enjoy this film however the genre is called horror and this is a horrifying movie.  However if you witnessed a surveillance camera catching a robbery where the thieves brutally kill and dismember the store clerk, that's not exactly great film making, yet it's still horror.

This is a hard film to review and doing this right after watching something like this is even harder.",1187222400,11,4944,4.603881278538813
2401991,4,B000B5Y0CS,"I recently purchased this movie based off of the rave and disturbing reviews I heard about it.  Having liked disgusting horror movies in the past I thought I'd give this one a try to test my mettle.  I had heard about the animal killings and rape scenes and nudity galore, so I figuerd what the heck.  This movie, by far was the most disturbing film I've witnessed.  I have a very strong stomach, but even I found myself becoming sick when watching the ""turtle"" scene.

The rape scenes are rather outrageous and a little too long for my liking(any amount of raping in movies disturbs me, but this was asinine).  The countless bashings in the head and dimemberments were nicely done and were what I was expecting all along.  But nevertheless, the animal killings will get to you the most, especially if you love the little critters like I do.  Rightfully so, I believe the crew that went filming this ""documentary"" got what they had coming to them.  With their torturing of the animals and the tribes' people,I kind of enjoyed watching these sick pukes get what they deserved.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.

While this movie did disturb me, I can't help thinking what possesed me to buy it in the first place.  I guess I just wanted to see what a true ""shockumentary"" looked like, and I definitely got it with the film.  This flick and the revolting scenes of torture, killings, cannibalism, and animal cruelty will fry your senses.  Not for the faint of heart or queazy, this film will stay embedded in your brain for quite some time.  I'm nervous to bring this home to my wife once I return from Iraq.  She would probably throw up all over me if I made her view it.  Maybe it's best if I just sell it to the next private or sergeant coming in.  LOL.

I gave this movie 4 stars opposed to five as I found the acting very laughable and cheesy, as well as the voice-overs to be quite bad at times.  But that is expected in a film such as this.  The gory parts are suprisingly realistic and very well done for that time period.  No CGI, so kudos on that to the filmmakers.  Overall, you get what you pay for-a sick, twisted, haunting depiction of cannibalism and torture, mixed in with rape and animal cruelty scenes aplenty.  If you want a film that will stick with you and make your skin crawl for weeks and weeks to come, this is your scene.  Pleasantly disturbing, but one viewing is enough for me.

2401992,3,B000B5Y0CS,"Where do I even begin? This one will shake you to the core. I went into this mentally preparing myself to see the most disturbing horror film of all time and reading reviews about how people had to turn off the movie or look away during some scenes. I went into it scared and it got worse when the opening scene rolled. 'The Disclaimer' warning viewers of what they are about to see scared me. During the first 20 minutes it was somewhat boring and i was there anticipating on what could happen next. I managed to get through the whole thing without looking away or turning off the tv in a somewhat apathetic state about the whole thing. Ive seen many horror films and this one was some parts documentary, media and what humans are capable of.

The film centers around some filmmakers who head into the south american jungle to find some cannibals. A professor manages to get the footage of these filmmakers who never returned. What they find on that film you will most likely never forget and never want to remember again.

 The young filmmakers in this movie are asking for trouble by taking advantage and setting the cannibals huts on fire and doing unspeakable acts to them. In a sense they are almost as bad as the cannibals, you don't know who to side with. Most definitely not the cannibals but also i don't see how anyone can have sympathy for the victims until maybe the end when they suffer a horrible and disturbing fate.

The most disturbing scenes were the turtle and the blonde guy at the end who gets it from the cannibals. Now during the film im telling myself this stuff has most likely happened in the past, maybe even in more recent times somewhere out there and to view it with an objective mind. Animals are killed all the time but that does not excuse the animal cruelty. The turtle scene was unecessary in my opinion.

I didn't realize the impact this film had on me until after it was all over. Let me put this way, i couldn't eat for 2 days, i could barely look at food and i could sit through 'Dead alive' eating something. If you don't know what Dead Alive is its probably one of the most gory films of all time though more comedic.

Cannibal Holocaust is not what i would call 'scary' per se. Im sure if i was there to experience this nightmare I would be scared but I can only describe this film using one word- Disturbing.. to the max. As for me, not so much while watching but after is when the majority of feelings came into play. This is a cruel violent yet realistic in a sense movie. This is hard to swallow and i cant say i would recommend this unless you are a HARDCORE horror film lover. I am and this one had some kind of effect on me. During the turtle scene i was thinking, hmm, who would enjoy this movie? a certain serial killer came to mind. If you have a stomach of steel and can handle brutality and gore unsurpassed then maybe you should watch it. If you want to call this horror then its 4 out of 5 stars but im going to leave it at 3 and let you decide on your own.",1185667200,24,3014,4.278947368421052

It does have the point of not only going all the way....but it takes the bar,....raises it and passes it.  There are those segments where you look at it and say ""How did they do that?"".  I use that same question because of (a)How the film makers were able to get away with that much violence and make it seem real....and (b)how it was filmed because it is hard to see anything that looks faked.  I'm sure there were the appropriate editing and visual effects that were there....and it was incredibly realistic.
The only downer to this is that you can tell where the overdubs and lip-synching didn't match up.  I found it to be very similar to many of the spaghetti-westerns that were made.

This show sucked. It was retarded, the only halfway beneficial quality it possessed was that the music was pretty top notch. It really reminded me of other Italian cinema such as the classic western ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"".

The acting is top notch and thoroughly brings us into the world of evil. The sound is sharp. The special effects are effective even after all these years. The script is concise and piercing, with very naturalistic dialogue. And the editing perfectly matches the pacing of the narrative.

This is the enigma of Cannical Holocaust; it is both deplorable and laudible. Unlike most exploitation films, it is masterfully crafted and delivers a moralistic message about America's (and the rest of the world's) invasion and destruction of indiginous cultures.

What this film gives you is the most realistic over the top, uncalled-for phony snuff film ever made. The film is so graphic and realistically shot that the filmmakers were charged with murder and had to produce the film's actors in a court of law to exhonerate themselves of the charges.  This is a powerful, incredibly well made and original film that certainly inspired the ""Blair Witch Project"", but while ""Blair Witch"" managed to terrify by not showing you anything and letting the storytelling do it's job, ""Holocaust"" has a silly story and shows you EVERYTHING: genital mutilation, gang rape, forced abortions, more internal organs than you'd think could fit inside the human body and, of course, cannibalism.  And let us not forget the very real animal torture the viewer is forced to endure.  One furry jungle creature (incorrectly dubbed a ""muskrat"" by one character) is held up to the camera and carved up, writhing and screaming in pain, with a knife.  In another instance which almost caused me to vomit, a very large turtle is dragged out of the river and hacked apart with a hatchet, internal organs jiggling like so much gelatin and limbs still kicking.  There's also a shot of a monkey getting his face chopped off with a machette.  The real kicker there is that they messed up the first take and had to get another monkey to redo the shot.  I should also add that none of these sequences advance the plot in any way, they are there just to be ghoulish.  That's where the irony comes in; you see the theme of the film is about the impossibly unethical and downright disgusting ends the film's documentarians go to to get sensational shots for their film.  One could easily make the same claim about the folks behind ""Cannibal Holocaust"" regarding these authentic animal mutilations that we are forced to sit through as we view this movie.  So again I wonder if, by deliberately attempting to make this film a morality tale about how humans dehumanize each other, they were being ironic and putting one over on the idiots who would take that line about who the real cannibals are as some deep philosophical commentary on our society.  If so, bravo.  But I doubt that's the truth; I'm of the opinion that it was a lame attempt by the purveyors of this garbage to justify a film that only exists to be so utterly disturbing and vile that only those looking for the most hardcore gore they could find would ever even attempt to watch it.  I love gore and horror as much as anybody (hence my viewing of the film), but this film is waaaay over the line for me and unless watching a newborn pulled from its mother's womb and thrown into a hole and buried as the mother's head is smashed in with rocks or a woman being violated with a disturbingly large piece of wood and then killed is your idea of must-see TV, I can't recommend you ever come near this film.",1176681600,13,3541,4.6293929712460065

I understand the violence against the animals was to show the brutal side of human nature, but using real animals was inexcusable. I can only hope the images fade from my memory.

The things i didn't like was that the movie drag in certain parts and the animal killing i didn't have a problem with (cause they were getting it ready for food), what i did have a problem with is that they let the camera linger on the animal killings which wasn't really cool, and no, its not about being weak, its about being decent..in other words, show the viewers what has happen (cause by then the viewers get the picture) and move on to the movie, not on a longggg version of how the animal is getting killed. The other thing i didn't like was that it boosted out too much like ""Blair Witch Project"" (a movie i hate with a passion)...sooo, ""Duh E"" for me for finding that out later on in life and for being ""Controversial""..take that word with a grain of salt OK..it doesn't have that much hype in it..geees. What i did like about the movie is that it had that ""campy"" 70s feel which i liked, and that during the filming the characters ""emotions"" played out very well, and the other best thing, is that, the tribe getting their revenge to the film makers and pretty much ending there lives because they ticked off the wrong people, the gore was OK, but thats the 70s for ya, cause todays horror would put this movie to sleep and make it look like a cake walk. But, most of all, the ending said it all, at the end, a question of thought of who are the ""real"" cannibals out there in the world..us or them?.

2402053,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust is like that freind who speaks everything on his mind, says it like it is, and does not sugarcoat the very obvious and sometimes hurtful truth.
As I watch Cannibal Holocaust for the 20th time now, the first scene with the brilliant music and the beautiful, yet haunting guitars still give me chills and raise the hairs on the back of my neck to this day.
Does Cannibal Holocaust go to far? Maybe. Is it offensive? Most definitely! If you are vegan, will you have a heartattack watching CH? Very possible. But the thing that intriuges me about CH, and others of it's kind, is the brutal honesty and realism, a vision of the real, very messed up world. This is life, this is death, this is the jungle we live in. Some people do not want to face the reality and dysfunctionality of life, they like to watch stuff that makes them feel ""good"", but I think the more people face the realities and atrocities of life, live with them, and accept them, the more man-kind will benefit from it's existence.

""It behoves every man who values the liberty of existence for himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others""

One of the other things I love about Cannibal Holocaust is that they really filmed it in the Amazon jungle. The scenery is THE best I've ever seen in a movie, you get close up lion shots and various animals, it just really sets the tone for the movie. They also used real tribes people for the movie, and it adds a authenticity to it.
Another thing I love about Cannibal Holocaust is that it starts up right from the beginning with no hesitation and is very fast paced.
If you notice, the guide, Miguel and Robert Kerman follow the exact same trail of the four people making the documaentary months before and pass by the turtle, Pedro, the villiage ect.
I also love how the movie jumps around with the time, I thought it was clever and pulled off really well. There is kind of a pattern with the time seqences. If you notice, the first shot after the wonderful open theme song is in Time Sqaure, and the last shot is in Time Sqaure.
Now, is Cannibal Holocaust art? Without a doubt in my mind CH is art.
Cannibal Holocaust is the highest form of art. Art is about a message, art is about being creative, art is about doing something that has never been done before, art is life and death.
My favorite scene is the one with the ""tree people"", when they hear the tape recorder and have dinner, classic.

If you don't have the mental capacity and understanding to watch a movie like this, you A) Won't like it, and B) Be disgusted by it. There are some scenes where the disgust is understandable, the animal cruelty scenes. Though many people might not be able to stomach the rape scenes in it. There are many films with more violence than Cannibal Holocaust, but this is the most realistic. It's not only a graphic movie, it has a good plot, and you want to know what's going to happen next. No problem with the acting, especially on the native side of it, great job. I'm a little late on my review having seen it a few years ago, but I decided to watch it again recently and remembered how great of a horror flick it really is. The atmosphere is untouchable, it raised the bar for showing how scary a jungle can really be. It's like a green nightmare, or should I say Green Inferno. The film is raw, rusty, dirty and everything else a cannibal film should be. It's a powerful film, and supposedly Hollywood is looking to remake this classic, if they do (which I hope not), it will never be as real as this, ever, the camera quality is untouchable.

2402055,1,B000B5Y0CS,"This is a classic example of how controversy generates unwarranted revenue. Still banned in several countries, this film teases audiences with ""the forbidden."" You see, the work was mistaken for a ""snuff film"" slightly after its initial release . . . and the director Deodato arrested. Of course, no actors were actually murdered. So, much of the controversy is deflated in a single breath.

Others find controversy in the depictions of animal cruelty. While Deodato himself has said, ""it was stupid to introduce animals,"" some viewers still find the ""verboten"" scenes titillating. Apparently, none of these people have ever seen the nightly news.

Professional critics dismiss the film as less-than-amateurish: as though the work were shot by a film-school freshman. Still, this attracts the ""cult"" viewers. Meanwhile, academics declare the work is devoid of meaning. Oddly, this entices some. I guess the idea is if scholars find it useless, the unwashed masses will find it amusing.

Still, none of these is the real problem . . . which is that the film is just boring. I am not asking for a work to have merit (who cares if it ""has meaning""), I am not asking for the director to have a great grasp of cinematography (some of the best films are shot by novices), I am not even asking for professional actors (having a SAG card does not make you a remarkable thespian) . . . all I am asking is to be entertained. And this film does not even fulfill that very modest request.

So, do not buy this work if you believe you are going to behold a truly ""forbidden"" film. There are a host of Japanese films that can fulfill that request. And do not buy this film if you are seeking relentless gore . . . again, the Japanese have that market cornered.

2402081,5,B000B5Y0CS,"First, I don't know how to effectively rate this, so I'll put five star for the cheer effectiveness of it, but that's irrelevant. I'm not sure it's a movie that's made to be rated in any normal way.

No use rehashing what the plot is once more, suffice to say it's very efficient and was, at the time, pretty innovative. But the plot device would have been moot were it not for the stunning craftsmanship of Ruggero Deodato and co. It's an extremely well done production, and I have never seen anything like it before or since. One of the main protagonist of the movie is often overlooked: the Amazon jungle. It's probably one of the most terrifying place ever rendered in any movie. Cannibal Holocaust wouldn't be half the movie it is were it not for the permanent sense of foreboding one feels amidst the oppressive scenery. It's easy to have empathy, at least on that level, with the film crew. Deodato makes the viewer feel like he's lost in the middle of nowhere, in an incredibly dangerous environment where everything can happen, at any time. By ricochet, this sense of terrible isolation takes its toll on Alan Yates and friends, and is also part of why they snap and produce mayhem on the tribes they later encounter.

The last reel of the crew's footage is probably the most intense thing I've seen on a screen. It is apocalyptic, disorienting, sordid and heartbreaking. In more than one way indeed, Cannibal Holocaust is a sad, despairing movie. And even though, by that time, the viewer is supposed to despise the film crew, it is quite disturbing to see anyone end up that way. The Pirkanen scene is a moment of such savagery, of such disregard for a human being that it stays with you for a long, long time. From his castration to his complete dismembering, it's a vision that will make anyone suffer, one of the most haunting scenes in any film.

I have to add that these scenes, and most of the rest of the movie, wouldn't pack such a punch if it were not for the incredible score by Riz Ortolani, which is the soul of the movie, and the reason why some parts are so hard to watch.

On the touchy subject of the abominable animal killings: perhaps everything and its contrary have already been said about those, but there are some precisions to add.

The ""they were killed for food"" line of defense doesn't hold under scrutiny, I'm afraid. The shot baby pig wasn't eaten afterwards, but left for dead as is, for one. Secondly, the infamous monkey scene had to be shot twice, so they in effect killed two animals. I highly doubt the friendly tribesmen stuffed their face twice with monkey meat because of the movie's needs, their love of monkey brains notwithstanding. Same as, I'm not quite convinced that tribes people do have goofy fun with turtle guts prior to eating it, when they hunt one. When I saw Pirkanen enjoying his fun and playing with the turtle's severed head (still gasping for air) in front of the camera, I somehow doubt it made his food better.
Same as I'm at a failure to understand how viciously kicking a pig twice before shooting it at close range will make it more tasty, but that's just me.

For those who have the Grindhouse DVD edition, it's said in a crawling text introducing the feature that this matter has been ""a subject of regret for everyone involved, Ruggero Deodato included"". Allow me to highly doubt that, to say the least. As ""recently"" as 2003, when the one-hour documentary on the feature was shot for an Italian release, none of the crew involved seemed to regret anything in that area, to put it mildly. Barbareschi (who is the one who shoots the pig, among others) goes even so far as saying he simply didn't give a s*** at the time, and still thinks today that the scenes and the movie ""called for it"" (i.e. the animal butchering). So please. Enough hypocrisy already. It seems to me that the crawl text regarding the so-called regret of the makers was put there by Grindhouse only to justify what is otherwise a good idea, i.e. offering an ""animal-cruelty free"" version of the film on the DVD. I don't believe for one second that it is a sincere comment, though. The only ones apparently genuinely disturbed by this aspect of the movie are Carl Yorke and Robert Kerman (""it was like they had pierced heaven,"" as he put it, in reference to the coatimundi's cries of pain and anguish as it is being slowly and painfully sliced open). Not Deodato, not Barbareschi, despite everything they might tentatively say to the contrary. I also don't find his latest ""regrets"" (as exposed in the bonuses in a more recent UK blu-ray edition) that much more convincing. One may be a visionary and technically gifted director, and be a slimy hypocrite, cynical bastard as a person at the same time. Which I believe Deodato is.
As it stands, I think the film suffers much from the animal killing crap, and hampers its message provided it does have one. It's the movie's major drawback, as has been said repeatedly before.

No matter what the ""message"" is, annihilating lives for entertainment's sake is vulgar, cowardly, and inelegant. It's a cheap shot, and plain lazy film-making. Case closed.

All that being said, I think the point is not to like or hate this movie. Its qualities are obvious, as are its few but very nasty drawbacks. The point being, it's an experience unlike anything else in cinema. Whether one wants to have that experience or not should really be an informed decision. The first time I saw it, 25 years ago, I wasn't in the least aware of what was ahead, and at the time I deeply regretted having seen this. Watching it again recently has put, of course, a perspective on the way I see the film, if only because I've read so many things about it since I first saw it, but even so, many of the old sensations came back as the film unfolded when I watched it again.

This is a very, very potent piece of film-making. This is something you can't ever unsee, and it's very unlikely you'll be able to forget some of the imagery once you've seen it, so proceed with caution and don't presume of your resistance to awfulness.

There are some serious issues apparent with anyone who finds the killing and/or torture of any living thing 'entertaining'. We aren't talking about the usual performance killing or rape of humans in this semi-movie. We all know (or we should) that this is done by semi-actors and isn't real. No humans were hurt in the making of this semi-film, unless you count the unfortunate few who actually (YEECH) watched the thing.

I will also say this: I do NOT believe in censorship or banning of art in any way.  However, the slaughter in Cannibal Holocaust involves BLATANT and INTENTIONAL animal torture.  This is unacceptable.  This, coupled with the abysmal script and production values, makes this one of the most awful, hypocritical, and insincere films I've ever seen.  I say ""insincere"" and ""hypocritical"" because the film views the atrocities committed upon the indigenous tribes as cruel and barbaric (which it certainly is) but COMPLETELY dismisses (and condones) the atrocities committed upon these helpless animals.  I'm not claiming that animals and people are the same, but any compassionate and rational person would find fault with this.  One can view humans as superior to animals and STILL value animal life.

2402087,5,B000B5Y0CS,"*** May contain possible Spoilers ***

At the beginning of the movie, I was treated to a very long disclaimer from the distributor that they do not want to be blamed for the content provided by the filmmakers. (They do, however, want to make loads of money off of it.) They even went so far as to quote Thomas Jefferson (?!?!), play the opening credits, then provide another disclaimer.

This film has the most interesting history behind. It is famous for the real animal slayings and for being accused of killing real humans. Deodato went to court to prove the film was not snuff and appeared on TV with his actors to prove they were still alive. The film grossed $1.9 million ($5 million today) in the first 10 days of it's opening before the film was banned in it's native country of Italy. Besides for the sheer cruelty and ""realness"" of the film, they put fake documentary information on their DVD Extras and website ([...]) to pretend this was real. I am not surprised the filmmaker was accused of making snuff.

The basic plot is this: A Professor and Explorers discover the fate of a missing documentary crew that disappeared in the jungle. They locate the missing footage and learn what really happened with the ""savages"". The Professor finds that after the crew finds the tribe to be docile, they push them to the brink of madness for the sake of good film-making, with disastrous consequences.

It is hard to side with anyone other than the Professor in this. The young crew members are shown at first as just young filmmakers looking for the truth. They have fun together, fall in love, and want to expose the truth. The real truth comes when the Professor discovers their footage and watches their slow decent into chaos. They become savage themselves by first killing animals, then the people. They suffer a horrible fate by the end.

Deodato should be proud for blurring the lines. The direction here is excellent. There is a social commentary at the nasty little heart of this film. It speaks volumes of civilization, the effect of media on society, ethics, morals, etc. This is not a sleazefest as you would think by its outward appearance. There are nuances added to every scene that adds something new to the story. For instance, in one scene the couple in the crew is having sex in the jungle. What adds to the creepiness is when you realize that their friend is filming it. The camera slowly turns and you can see that they forced about 50 villagers to watch this happen to ""teach them how Americans have sex."" The sex was not put in this film to draw attention, but to draw attention to the complete disregard of humanity.

{Portion of review removed to stay within word limit. View full review at [...]}

This is an incredibly effective and powerful film. It is too realistic to be considered entertaining, but it is the first film in a long time that made me feel something real. Horror films disappoint many adult lovers of horror today. They can no longer make you squirm or give you nightmares. Well, this one hit home for me. It might be today's events (War on Iraq, Genocide in Africa, Bordertown in Mexico, etc.) that make this all too real. I felt shell-shocked when it was over. I felt like a victim watching this as though I was assaulted too as these are crimes against all of humanity. At the same time, I felt guilty for watching as though I was committing the crimes myself by not intervening. There is a huge blame placed on the rest of society because these crimes do occur everyday and we sit and watch the news and believe everything that is told to us without question. This film will make you either hate mankind or want to hug your neighbor.

I should mention the animal slayings. These are all real. The camera looms over the animals with the gore shown in detail. The worst part is hearing the animals screaming. The muskrat killing was the worst and almost brought me to tears. It took multiple stabbings before it was killed.

The sound quality was decent considering it was shot in a jungle, but there was weird transitioning between dialogue and background noise causing a bit of ""popping"" in a couple scenes. The film quality of course was fantastic. The look and feel of the film was real giving the viewer the sensation that they were watching actual footage.

Favorite Quote: One of the main characters says, ""It's Survival of the Fittest. The strong overcoming the weak,"" as a little piglet is tied to a stake in the ground, kicked repeatedly, falls down squealing, then is shot for no reason at all. This scene is real. It is said that the actor practiced his lines repeatedly then flubbed them due to the nastiness of this scene. They could not reshoot it as they could not find any more pigs to kill.

DVD Extras: Audio Options, Commentary, and Trailers. ""Inside the Green Inferno"" gives detailed fake bios for each character, tribes, ""New Findings"", and the original script.

Bottom Line: Do I think it should be Banned? No. For the disillusioned horror fan of today, I highly recommend this. It will blow your mind. The 25th Year Anniversary Collectors Edition is being released now. But for the weak of heart with weak stomachs, most definitely pass on this. Animal lovers beware.

Rating: 0/10 for the Atrocities and a Perfect 10/10 for Effectiveness.

2402088,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Okay, there are many, many things in this film that are totally unexcusable.  Real violence against animasl (though the Grindhouse version has an option where you can watch the movie without that), sexual violence, unchecked gore and more.  It is the kind of film that gets distributors in trouble, and the kind that makes people sick.  That said, it's an incredible film.

From a serious, critical point of view, this film was way ahead of its time in its portrayal of blood-n-guts ratings and reality television.  As I write this, the Crocodile Hunter was killed a few weeks ago, and while not exactly in the same vein, it's definitely in the same mindset.  Viewers can't help but watch to see how far the filmmakers will go, even as those same filmmakers are making social commentary about that very thing.  It's surreal and very real all at the same time.  It's also not gore just for gore's sake, though plenty will argue that.

With all this praise, it must be noted that this film is not for everyone.  It's not for people who think ""Scream"" is the height of horror.  It's not for those who think ""Saw"" went a little too far.  It's also not for those who just ""get off"" on senseless violence in order to seem cool in the eyes of their equally pitiful friends.

2402121,4,B000B5Y0CS,"This is a film that will test the bravest souls. I had reviewed this film earlier but Amazon doesn't seem to have shown it perhaps due to it perhaps being seen as an overly hostile review and maybe some coded politics as well. The truth is, with the story the way it pans out ( which I'm not going into detail since plenty here have explained it better ) is that this is indeed, a highly political film. While you may question why it has to show excessive amounts of gore, it is a fair representation of the world we live in. There are morals to this film, but only if you want to learn them. If you just want gore galore then it will also satisfy. It's a film that questions Western society's morality and really pushes to the limits of what people would find decent or indecent. Mankind we learn as we've known before are savages, no matter what environment they are in. It should also teach that you should not mess with people, or things in which you do not know. And of course greed.....but you'll learn that from watching the movie.

It's not surprising that this film is still banned in some countries around the world. I've never been a fan of censoring films but perhaps there are some things that need some censoring...but that will only make people more curious. Howandever what you will see in this film is a horror movie that puts others to shame.

2402122,4,B000B5Y0CS,"The Blair Witch Project stole the idea from this movie where a idiotic yet professional camera crew travels to Colombia to shoot footage of a primitive cannibal tribe in their native habitat where of course things go wrong and the crew becomes lunch. Not really a horror movie but an exploitation/grindhouse flick, it contains gallons of (real and f/x) blood and guts, bad dubbing, an effective music score and is loaded with nude scenes.  That being said, the story is lucid and not at all confusing like other movies in this genre (Italian horror), and competently directed although the director had to defend himself from murder charges which delayed the release by 4 years.

Cannibal Holocaust's reputation, since it was (supposedly) banned in 60(!) countries, was for the killing of a pig, turtle and a couple of monkeys which seems ridiculous since they were all eaten anyway.

However salacious the title may sound, it's never boring and has a goofy sense of humor including the sex scene while the village is burning, the crew cavorting naked in the hotel while their camera's rolling and other (graphic) mayhem. The only negative aspect was the heavy-handed theme of comparing our society's morals with the cannibal's morals.

2402123,5,B000B5Y0CS,"A film by Ruggero Deodato (Jungle Holocaust). Ripout! Barbecue! Devour! How long can you take it? A New York anthropologist, named Professor Harold More (Robert Kerman), travels to the wild, inhospitable jungles of South American with two local guides to find out what happened to a documentary film crew which disappeared nearly a year earlier while traveling into the same jungle, called the 'Green Inferno' to film a documentary about reputed cannibal tribes. After a long search and encountering a few primitive tribes, Professor More finds the remains of the crew and several reels of their undeveloped film. Upon returning to the USA, Professor More views the film in detail featuring the travels of the director Alan Yates (Gabriel York), his assistant Faye Daniels (Francesa Ciardi), and cameramen Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi) venturing into the jungles where the inexperienced, street-wise film group, after finding the indigenous tribes to docile for their film, decide to push them for kicks, with drastic consequences.

2402124,4,B000B5Y0CS,"During the 1970's, Italian cinema, which was not subject to the usual copyright laws, embarked on a spate of copycat productions based on the success of US movies in Italian movie houses. For instance, after George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', or 'Zombi', as it was known in Italy went through the roof, a ton of celluloid was devoted to numerous ""Morti Viventi"" schlock, such as Lucio Fulci's rather good 'Zombi 2', or 'Zombie Flesh Eaters', as it was known outside Italy and Bruno Mattei's 'Zombie Creeping Flesh'. Both of these films, among others, increased Romero's onscreen blood and guts fetish a few notches and generally tried to outdo the American director's 1978 opus. Each production tried to out-gore the other and up the ante a little more every time. These spaghetti ""zombi"" films thrived on ridiculous story lines, fabulous make up and horrific death and kept the undead alive in cinema well into the 80's.

Alongside the zombie massacres, arose another more home-grown attempt at pushing the barriers of cinematic revulsion. The Cannibal movie subgenre, initiated in 1972 by Umberto Lenzi's 'Deep River Savages' and Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal' in 1976, owed little to the living dead or US box office success, even though both types are often linked together. The ""mondo movie"" was the real father of the Italian cannibal cycle and the undertones of ""mondo"" can be seen in most cannibal movies.

Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust' was one of those movies that made it clear that Italian cannibal productions were born out of the dubious onscreen delights of the likes of 'Mondo Cane', even including a nod to Mondo's inhibition to placing faked footage alongside genuine documentary footage. One of the Deodato's characters even states that obvious genuine documentary footage of people being executed was being ""faked"" by Alan Yates (Gabriel Yorke), the leader of a documentary film crew who are at the centre of the movie.

'Cannibal Holocaust' concerns itself with disappearance of the aforementioned TV crew, who made their names with hard hitting documentaries about Africa and Cambodia. The crew went missing while filming their current project, 'The Green Inferno', a travelogue expose of the cannibal tribes of the Yamamonos and the Shamataris in South America.

Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) of New York University is tasked with finding out what happened to Yates and his crew. His search leads him to uncover evidence that the TV crew were, in fact, dead. But, he manages to recoup some of the film footage that was shot by them and returns to New York with the un-processed film cans. Thus ends the first half of the film. All fairly harmless so far.

The second half of 'Cannibal Holocaust' deals with Monroe's viewing of Yates' film and his growing reluctance to have anything to do with the project. Yates' footage is presented in a very convincing hand-held ""documentary"" fashion, giving the later half of the movie (including its gory effect's) a quite realistic and genuinely disturbing feel.

Yates' documentary reveals the extreme lengths that he and his crew went through to achieve the ""fame"" they desired. Yates and Co. go deeper and deeper into depravity, pushing native tribes people to the point where they eventually turn on the TV crew with a vicious retribution, resulting in the liberal use of some very effective gore prosthetics. This is really all you need to know about the second half of 'Cannibal Holocaust' and I don't wish to give too much away to a potential viewer.

'Cannibal Holocaust' is no polished production as one would expect from a film of this type. But, somewhat surprisingly, it's no turkey either. The acting of the first half is generally mediocre to bad, which is to be expected in a production of this sort. But the goofball / depraved antics of Yates' TV crew in the second ""documentary footage"" half suits the piece well. This depravity is showcased well in the famous scene, where the TV crew come across an impaled native girl and Yates has to be warned to stop smiling as the camera is rolling. The joy expressed at this truly classic 80's ""video nasty"" image by Yates is indicative of the mindset of the people we are dealing with.

There's not many movies like 'Cannibal Holocaust' and that's one of the reasons it deserves its 4 stars. For those with the stomach, the film exhibits a genuinely creepy and disturbing atmosphere throughout its running time, helped no end by Riz Ortolani's weird and compelling score. Its convincing atrocity, violent rape, murder, gut chomping and appalling real animal slaughter take the viewer to a level that few movies can manage, or should even attempt. In short, it does exactly what it says on the tin. In fact, it did it so well that the film was ""outed"" in some quarters as a genuine ""snuff"" movie. The director was even taken to court over the ""death"" of the documentary teams actors! This backfired spectacularly when the actors in question were actually subpoenaed and had to appear in the courtroom.

Despite (or perhaps because of) all the nonsense, 'Cannibal Holocaust' was a notable success in Italy, but was either cut heavily or banned outright in many other countries. It topped the list in Britain during the hysterical (and politically motivated) ""video nasties"" bill of 1984 and remained unavailable for many years, gaining more and more notoriety every time the film was mentioned. All of this seems rather silly now, as mainstream Hollywood productions have continued to push various cinematic taboos throughout the period. But as mentioned earlier 'Cannibal Holocaust' offers something that will not be contained in the average Hollywood horror flick or any other flick for that matter and it's unlikely that such material will be produced in the same manner again. For that reason alone, it's a film that should be viewed by people who are interested in the horror genre or cinema in general. Of course, everyone who approaches it should be aware of its content. But few people who'll look at this film will be unaware of its past or reputation.",1155686400,9,6099,4.9715686274509805
2402125,3,B000B5Y0CS,"This movie shows scenes of raw sex, rape, ritualistic torture, murder, and cannibalism.

Ok so much for the good parts.

It also shows actual video of animals being killed.  There's one scene where they kill a turtle that is probably over 100 years old.

In that sense is it a movie about people from modern society going into the jungles and ruining everything ?  Or is it a real example of people ruining everything while making a movie ?  I don't know.

A lot of the footage in this movie is supposed to be 'recovered' from an expedition of a bunch of fun seaking film makers who just happen to enjoy putting the natives into straw huts and then setting them on fire.

There's a lot of scenes where the camera is moving around, pointing up into the trees, etc..

They probably recite the line ""Turn that *&^@#$%' camera off !"" about 100 times while ranting and shouting about various things.

Fortunately real indigenous people don't behave like they are portrayed in this movie.

Still if you like scenes involving rugged sex and rape plus gore this is the movie for you.

2402126,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocuast film is known all over the world for being one of the most controversial films ever made and it is well deserving of that honor. This film depicts a group of documentary filmmakers that travel deep within the Amazon jungle to do a documentary on jungle tribes. They disappear. Later when a scientist and a guide are sent in to see what became of the group they discover the filmmakers lost film cases. Taking the film back to New York and upon viewing them, they discover the hideous acts the filmmakers inflicted on the tribes and also the horrendous acts the tribes then inflicted on the filmmakers themselves. This is not an easy film to watch as torture, rape, and real animal killings will offend many viewers. Cannibal Holocaust however is a well made film that rises far above other such films in the so called ""Italian Cannibal"" subgenre. Director Ruggero Deodato takes us down a disturbing road to show us that life isn't always nice and sometimes civilized humans can be just as inhuman and animalistic as the uncivilized. Exploitation film it is, but a good exploitation film with brains that will be sure to stay with viewers for long after they view it.

I LOVED it!! For those who will immediately dismiss this movie as sensationalistic(it is), over the top gory(it is) or mindless(It is NOT) You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It is defintely NOT for everyone.

In my opinion, this is NOT just a great Cannibal movie, this is a great MOVIE regardless of the genre. It will leave the viewer definitely disturbed and feeling as though they have just been hit by a truck. The documentary style footage of the ""lost"" film crew is so profoundly disturbing on so many levels. I don't want to give anything away and it would be so easy to do, but if you are a horror/gorehound/underground film fan, you MUST see this movie.

It has been said that CH is the inspiration for Blair Witch. Dont let THAT prevent you from watching it either. It is NOTHING like BW. Only the premise of lost footage being found is similar. What is ON that footage is MILES apart.

If you are looking for cinema that pushes the boundries that is what you get with Cannibal Holocaust. This is by no means a good film, the animal killings (real or not) were redundant, and all the other brutality was over the top.

2402191,1,B000B5Y0CS,"The rest of the reviews for ""Cannibal Holocaust"" presented here will give you a pretty good example of what to expect from this film. So, I'm just adding my two cents from an alternative perspective.

I won't go into the gratuitous nature of the violence, since I've always felt such a statement is redundant when it comes to horror films anyway. That being said, the on-screen killing of animals, even if they are consumed afterward, seems even more pointless than the litany of violence normally associated with these types of horror films. The cannibal sub-genre that had its heyday in the late 70s was known for pandering purely to exploitation and grotesque imagery, rather than for suspense or terror. Don't mistake ""Cannibal Holocaust"" for a frightening film.

As a fan of the horror genre, I've seen a wide variety of fictional human deaths, and so the gore and violence of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" didn't impact me terribly. There have been, for me, more disturbing ""people being eaten"" scenes amongst the zombie sub-genre. After reading so much about the supposedly visceral nature of the violence, I felt it to be competently portrayed but nothing to write home about. When characters you've developed an affection for are killed in a film, with or without gore, you feel a twinge. When so many nameless victims are disposed of, the reaction devolves into ""meh... nice special effects"".

Ultimately, what disturbed me most about ""Cannibal Holocaust"" was that, with the exception of one male at the end, the most brutal violence is reserved soley for women. Several rapes, the forced abortion, and a variety of brutal deaths are visited upon the female natives while the men are occasionally shot or beaten, but not subjected to the level degradation aimed at female characters. By the end of the film, it was this fact that left me sick at having ""experienced"" ""Cannibal Holocaust"".",1148860800,23,1889,4.9904761904761905

I just remember that when I got done watching, it had made me sick to my stomach for a little while, and I didn't want to eat any kind of meat for a few hours!!!!  I'd say it's kind of a sad film.  These filmmakers in the jungle who are being mean to these cannibal tribes end up losing their lives, which in a way they deserved it.  They were mean and they burned some of their homes, raped their women and thought watching an abortion was funny all while taping it.  It didn't make me think that the movie was sick.  It probably had some truth to it of real live things that could happen that we never see because of where we live and the kind of lifestyles we choose.  I find the acting was a bit cheesy, but to be expected because the movie is old.

2402194,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Ruggero Deodato made a couple of dozens of movies, and hardcore horror fans might know some of them, but in cinematic history he will be forever remembered as the creator of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" - one of the most disturbing and nauseating flicks ever made. By the way unlike many other ""most disturbing"" movies this one, made a quarter of century ago, still shocks. Seems like time doesn't affect it at all.

Probably ""CH"" was originally intended to be another exploitation film - like ""Cannibal Ferox"", ""The Last Cannibal World"" of Deodato again, ""Eaten Alive"" - to pertain to this subgenre of cannibal horror. But somehow Deodato managed to make it out of the genre's framework, and ""CH"" now I think may be viewed not just by gorehounds around the globe but by more general audience in spite of the fact that it's really gory and violent.

If to compare ""CH"" to Umberto Lenzi's ""Cannibal Ferox"" you'll see that the latter copies and echoes Deodato's film practically frame by frame, line by line, but nevertheless

""CF"" has no sense - it's simple and stupid exploitation schlock. But ""CH"" has some meaning if you will. I strongly believe those who say all the film's torture, mutilation, mayhem and brutality was gratuitous are wrong. They were director's instruments to show the inadequacy of today's world. To show the corruption and vice of ""civilized"" people who would do anything for money and fame. Who'd maim and rape just to get their 15 minutes. And all the cannibals' cruelty is just an act of self-defence - by means appropriate TO THEM. It's their savage world, it's what they used to. By the way we can clearly see the difference in how distinctly cannibals accept intruders. When they are visited by people with no evil intentions they welcome them and no one dies.

We see the greed of TV-officials who want to air the brutal ""cannibal documentary"" no matter what to get their poll numbers. Even knowing it's a pseudo-documentary, knowing beforehand what their relentless crew was capable of. Only professor Monroe played by Robert Kerman tries to study out the situation and prevent the notorious documentary from being aired.

So I saw much more to ""CH"" than it seemed at first. And I guess most of the people don't get it right, their eyes being shadowed by all that violence. But when you watch it draw your attention to the music which marks the most shocking scenes - I'm pretty sure this downbeat sounds were to emphasize their effect. When you hear this music you realize all the brutality was not gratuitous - the director knew quite well what he was doing, and he was doing it for a reason.

And finally I have to say: think twice before you watch it. If you're squeamish better don't. It's utterly disturbing at moments just like some docu-footage of wartime atrocities. By the way (and this is a well-known fact) all the animal cruelty in the film was real. But the Grindhouse Releasing edition has a feature letting you to skip all those scenes. Anyway if you could handle ""August Underground"", ""Men Behind the Sun"" or ""Scrapbook"" you'll manage ""CH"".",1146355200,21,3080,4.769230769230769

I will admit that for its time, this film was way ahead.  I can see why people thought it was real, and the movie was banned in many contries.  This is one of a kind, the way it was shot, I think it is cinematic originality.  Yes it's gross, yes it's violent, yes it will stay in your mind for a long time.

There's still talk to this day on what's real in the movie and what's staged(like the much debated scene of an impaled woman in the jungle)but what I can say with 90% certainty(10% just in case)is that the human deaths aren't real but all the animal deaths are.

2402233,5,B000B5Y0CS,"After 25+ years, Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece of celluloid horror sees the light in a beautiful transfer courtesy of Sage Stallone and Bob Murawski at Grindhouse Releasing.  For everyone who doesn't think that a horror film can have an intelligent angle to it, you NEED to see this movie. Along with MONDO CANE and the other films of Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST cast a long fore-shadowing over the television networks and their quest to gain ratings by showing more and more shocking items (tv news), what lengths people will go to for money (FEAR FACTOR), fame (AMERICAN IDOL) and just to prove themselves (SURVIVOR).

  For those who think that the carnage and gore in this film is real, HOW could Perry Pirkanen (the blond dude) appear 2 years later in CANNIBAL FEROX and CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka THE GATES OF HELL) if he were dead?  HOW could Gabriel Yorke be a professor at a college in New Hampshire if HE were dead?  Deodato has proven himself a force to be reckoned with many times, but with the release of this dvd, people can now see the ultimate slinging of mud back at the organization that started many stories of this type, TV News and the garbage that runs it.",1142208000,5,1212,4.666666666666667

2402236,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Call me crazy if you must but I love the mondo-canibale genre & will buy any film made by Lenzi or Deodato which exploits cannibalism. This, by far, may be one of the most difficult ones for me to stomach however as it's very disturbing. Needless to say, it rocks!

Unlike other cannibal films in this genre, this one actually forces us to question who the real cannibals are. After we're finished watching the film, we are left with too many questions to ask ourselves & others.

In the beginning, Professor Monroe sets out on an expedition to find out what happened to four film-makers who had initially stepped into the green inferno to make a documentary on the natives themselves. Having successfully made friends with the natives, Dr. Monroe is able to bargain with them & they actually let him have the footage which is well kept inside the film canisters used by the four film-makers. Ofcourse, not before we are able to see their skeletal remains in a grisly monument of some sort which contains all the canisters of film.

When Dr. Monroe returns to the states, he in turn interviews all of the immediates of the documentary kids themselves & one could say they weren't anymore popular over here than they would've been in the green inferno itself. Ugly Americans? But wait, we're getting to the good stuff. The footage is developed & viewers  are able to witness what the film-makers were truly like. They flayed a gigantic turtle. They burned the villagers homes. They raped a young girl repeatedly. After having seen what savages these kids really were, we no longer think about the natives of the green inferno as cannibals. Most of us are already sick of watching these disgusting Americans wreak havoc on someone else's land & are ready for them to die.

Needless to say, the viewer is now subjected to watching their excruciatingly painful deaths in loving detail. That's Deodato detail. Yes, nothing here looks fake. Rumour has it that real animals were slaughtered during the making of this film for purposes of authenticity. While I do not condone the killings of animals to make this film, one can't deny the power of the film overall. Cannibal Holocaust is Grindhouse fare indeed although the quality of the craftmanship here is on par with anything Hollywood could've made.

I can see now why this film would've been banned although I think Cannibal Holocaust teaches a valuable lesson in humanity (or lack thereof) if you think you can stomach the montages. I definately give it my highest rating for a film in this genre. The only other film I found as gory or repulsive was Emanuelle & The Last Cannibals. While the latter is less disturbing than the former, I think the gore would satisfy most gorehounds.",1140652800,7,2732,4.765327695560254
2402237,5,B000B5Y0CS,"i had the pleasure of seeing this uncut at last year's dublin horrorthon (with director present, shook his hand afterwards) and have to say it was one of the most intense films i've seen in years.  sometimes, even though you're enjoying a movie, you can be all too aware of where you are - here i sat transfixed throughout.

you know the history of course, how it's been heavily cut and banned down the years, features animal cruelty and some disturbing rape/ torture sequences and was considered one of THE NASTY video nasties of the 80s, a generally 'nasty' decade politically, come to think of it.

so while video nasties were something of a scapegoat, that's missing the point of this film.  and, unlike numerous other movies i could mention of around the same era this HAS a point, which has been documented by several other reviewers here (kudos, esp to the guy who mentioned the lemmings footage, never knew that).

director deodato (sp, i'm in a hurry) superbly shows the documentary makers as ruthless and unfeeling in their pursuit of footage, at first lulling you into thinking this was going to be another film about ""savages"" through the discovery of their film, which is gradually reviewed by a professor as a tv station look to use it as a documentary.  the tables are turned, and you're left feeling shocked and slightly ill as events unfold.  it's not an easy film to watch, but it's not the exploitation flick people have it pegged as either.

2402271,5,B000B5Y0CS,"This is one of those ""legendary, unseen"" films like El Topo or Satantango (for the record, I've seen both).  Now that one is able to see it on a superb transfer by the boys at Grindhouse Releasing, it more than lives up to its reputation.  An incredibly bleak, disturbing, and probing look at man, his propensity for violence, the media's manipulation of facts and footage, and the barbarism that exists everywhere, this film is a masterpiece.  It starts out as your usual exploitative Italian horror film, but when the ""documentary"" footage comes into the film, it gets more and more intense and haunting.  The music of the film is one of the greatest scores I've ever heard, subtle and haunting, making a brilliant counterpoint to the sheer brutality of the film.  The film itself pulls no punches, and makes no apologies for what it shows or how.  Many ""gorehounds"" don't really like this film, because it is not a fun movie.  Gorehounds tend to like their films gory but cheesy, able to laugh afterwards.  You can't laugh or shrug this film off, even though many have tried.  Especially telling is the hidden Easter Egg on the DVD credits, where Grindhouse taped a showing of the film in 2001, and you see the audience before, during, and after the screening.  Before the screening, the audience (mostly guys and a few girls) act all cool, mug for the cameras, and generally try and act like their ""hip"" and ""ironic"" (in other words, the smug Gen X types).  But during the film they sit there stunned, and at the end, they are completely numbed by it.  Some try and crack a smile, but to no avail.  They are affected.  You can't laugh this film off.  I object to the disclaimer Grindhouse runs before the film when you watch the original cut (there's an animal-cruelty free version as an option).  It gives the usual ""we believe this film to be important (which it is), but it is extremely irresponsible"".  Yet, they release a special 2 DVD edition of it, and give the usual ""we don't believe in censorship"" speech.  Stand by the film and say ""yes, it's a difficult film to watch.  But I don't apologize for it at all.  Make of it what you will."".  This is what I would have done.  See it soon, before it disappears again....",1137888000,5,2229,4.575757575757576
2402272,5,B000B5Y0CS,"So where should i start. This movie is vile, disguisting, and made irresponsibly, and with total disregard to taste. However the film is structured very well, and uses great technique when it comes to cinematography.

Is this ART or Schlock.

That all depends on the viewer. I'm sure most of those thinking about purchasing this film are ultra gorehounds. The last sequences of the film feature some amazing gore fx, and do not dissapoint. However it takes a bit of time for the good stuff to start.

There's also the issue of unexcusable animal cruelty. I'm not sure anyone could be that depraved to enjoy seeing a monkey get it's skulltop split and it's brains eaten. fortunately there's the animal cruelty free version available on the disk.

That gets to the point of special features. Grindhouse did an excellent job providing a list of features to make this disc worth ever  penny. Part of the fun is finding the easter eggs hidden throughout the 2nd disc. They range from fan reaction to the first theatrical showing of the cannibal holocaust tour in 2001 to a debbie does dallas trailer.

If you are a fan of this movie you should definently check out: The Mutilator, Jungle Holocaust, Dead Alive, and Guinea Pig.",1136073600,4,396,4.925373134328358
2402274,1,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust (1980) is one of the most legendary of the legendary video nasties, mostly because it features scenes of actual animal slaughter, and all manner of faked rapes, beating, stabbing and, in one particular scene, a violent, ritualistic abortion, and all that is on top of the titular allusions to cannibalism and physical dismemberment!!  The plot prefigures the ber-successful Blair Witch Project, in the respect that the second half of the film is supposedly made up lost-footage from a film crew who disappeared whilst making a documentary in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.  Thus, the first half of the film involves a university professor who retraces the steps taken by the film crew in order to retrieve the lost footage.  This half of the film plays (almost) like a Werner Herzog film, with the roving, naturalistic camera work and drifting shots of rivers, swinging tree-canopies and locals positioned ominously amongst the tall jungle grass.

The second half of the film is where the nastiness begins... although, to be honest, none of the actual human atrocities can rival the appalling sight of a turtle being dragged out of a river to be butchered and played with in graphic detail!!  Director Ruggero Deodato revels in every moment of the violence and the gore, but sadly, fails to offer anything approaching character, drama, tension, artistic intelligence, imagination, technical proficiency, or depth.  With the exception of the lead character, the aforementioned professor, none of the characters manage to become anything more than obnoxious frat-boy caricatures, leering and mugging to the camera and possessing all the charm and talent of a plank of wood.  The only saving grace of the film is Deodato's moralistic message (which really arrives far too late to take on any real relevance), in which the filmmakers turn out to be morally bankrupt opportunists only there to torment and torture the Amazon natives in order to create heart-wrenching social propaganda (the director further reinforces this idea by showing us the crew's previous film, snappily titled Road to Hell, which features actual stock-footage of real-life political executions).

Deodato's concept of a morally-bankrupt media in love with ratings and awards at the sake of human suffering is an important one... a prospect still very much relevant today, what with the over-abundance of reality TV shows, atrocity websites and the concept of happy slapping.  However, for me, the relevance of the debate is dwarfed by Deodato shocking treatment of animals.  To my mind, any film that uses violence in order to comment on the violence in the media (or, indeed, society) is unbelievably hypocritical, and, in depicting the violence in such a glorified and exploitive way, is really just as appalling as when such material is used to sell newspapers or to illicit sympathy during the six o'clock news.  You may disagree with me and see some sense of truth in Deodato's sub-textual ideology... either way, you've gott'a ask yourself, why are you watching this film??  Instead of creating an intelligent and emotionally moving depiction of media manipulation and the double-standards of war (the most successful aspect of the film were the allusions to Vietnam, with the American film crew, apparently the heroes, invading these small, peaceful villages and causing a great deal of damage and offence in a manner that recalls the massacre at My Lai), Deodato mostly creates a sluggish vacuum of attention seeking set-pieces and over-the-top gore.

As a result, Cannibal Holocaust only really works as a morbid-curiosity piece.  Like most of these once-banned video-nasties, the film is one that anyone with an interest in film should see, in order to see how things used to be.  It's also likely to attract an audience who just want to see how violent the film is, or to revel in the excess and the cruelty.  I watched it to see if the Slant Magazine review was accurate when they referred to it as; ""artful enough to demand serious critical consideration, yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering"".  They're probably spot on.  Not only is the film shallow and empty-headed, it's also quite dull.  The 95 minute running time drags at a snails pace (as I've said before, the first half feels almost like a demented take on Herzog's Cobra Verde, whilst the second half is a vacuous collection of shock-moments and calculated gross-out tactics), whilst the rough editing, over-exposed images and out-of-synch dubbing (not to mention the atrocious acting) is enough to drive you to distraction.

Seriously, arguments that the footage is purposely bad in order to evoke a sense of reality are bull-sh*t.  I've studied TV production for three-years.  If the quality was so wilfully bad, it would never get shown on TV (simple as)... the same can be said about the Blair Witch.  I don't buy the validity of the moral message either... anyone with so much compassion for the human race wouldn't feel it necessary to chop a monkey's face off, or cut off the head of an endangered turtle before waving it around in front of the camera.  There's also a lot of sexual violence, particularly involving women and blunt objects being inserted into various orifices.  This kind of leering, voyeuristic excess renders the anti-war, anti-consumerist, anti-media message obsolete (you can say the same about Man Bites Dog, Funny Games, etc).  The people who have written about this film as if it's some kind of important social document, or worse, a horror film that is actually scary (it's not scary at all... we want the filmmakers to die and the cannibals to win, and they do... huzzah!!!) must have been watching a different film than me.  Even the notoriously dodgy Zombie Flesh Eaters was more disturbing than this.

If you really want to see how violent this film is, then by all means, give it a try... if only to satisfy your curiosity.  But please, don't buy into the hype that this is some kind of disturbing, ultra-realistic parable about man's capacity for violence (the prosthetic gore effects are really dated anyway), and don't waste your money on something you'll probably only ever watch once.",1135814400,47,6218,5.056751467710372
2402275,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Deodatos Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most famous exploitation horrors that emerged from the wildly inventive 1970's. This was the era that had ripped open the horror genre and quite literally pulled it's insides out for all to see and holcaust neatly bookended the 70's by taking it that one bit further. Often reviled and critisised by the media around the time of it's release CH was thrown into the stew with abominations like 'Driller Killer', 'Devil Hunter' and 'SS Hell camp' as so called video nasties along with other benchmark horrors like 'Last house on the left' & 'Evil Dead'. Only in the wake of modern horror films like 'Blair witch Project' and current indie horror directors like Rob zombie & Eli roth who cite CH as a major influence has CH finally got its justification. Watching it today you can see why Mother was a little worried about our poor children, it's not disney but even in 1979 something tells me that mother still had the option of hiding the tapes or better still not bringing the tape into the house at all. Yes it's shocking to see fetus's being pulled out of women by hand, or watching strange moustached man's genitals being lopped off but it wasn't just the senationalism of the violence that got the censors and the peoples front against artistic freedom all bothered it was the realism of the movie within a movie scenario thats so well documented. Deodato shot his film makers so well that once the pay off kicks in in the final third of the movie, not only do you believe that these guys are being slaughtered you actually secretly detest them so much that you want them to get eaten, the director intensified this belief by showing various real deaths of animals, most famously the needless slaughter of a turtle by the film crew, in the hope that it would make the whole exercise seem more real, that maybe this could all be happening and it's here that holocaust has to be critisised, for all it's inventiveness surely the film makers could have made a fake turtle or shot blanks after all they did an excellent job on the human make up surely it was possible to drum up some fake animals. There really is no excuse for it and for the most part this is where the film has suffered at the hands of most critics & those alike, it's not pleasent viewing and largely quite hypocritical of the movies underlying message. These points aside, Deodato is clever in not giving his protagonists an inch of regret in there barbaric behaviour as not to make any emotional attachment to the audience, this after all is the point of the movie with the famous 'who are the real cannibals' voice over. The effects are still fantastic but this is largely due to super 8 film and a lot of inventive camera work and editing (Latex never looked this real ever again) and believe it or not for an italian horror a pretty solid and believable cast. These days theres not much point in dissecting these movies too much as with alot of these so called 'Video nasties' the people who critisised them in the first place missed the point completely. Deodato was making a horror film and succeeded, yes a bit of social commentary was thrown in aswell but for the most he made an entertaining horror film that opened the doors for future genre movies by pushing 2 fingers up to the censor (if only he had removed the animal violence.) Horror movies have evolved into cartoons almost with lunchbox accessible slasher figures and tom and jerry violence so it's nice that companies like Grindhouse make special efforts to dig out classics that can still pack a punch even today, after all with efforts like Boogeyman, the fog and Jeepers creepers we have to get our shocks somewhere haven't we.

2402276,4,B000B5Y0CS,"this is the most disgusting movie i have ever seen, not only because of the intensely graphic violence (human deaths were faked, but several animals including monkeys were tortured and killed in the making) but because of the sheer brutality of the film's ""protagonists"", four seemingly likeable American filmmakers.  The plot summary tells that the Americans are killed by a ""savage"" tribe of cannibals.  However, by the time they finally meet their end in the movie, is is only after an unchecked spree of raping, killing, and burning alive the natives.  While the scenes of the Americans being dismembered and eaten are the most violent in the movie, the natives seem to be wholly justified.  The reason for the intensely sadistic behavior of the Americans is never given.  Is it simply the madness caused by the complete freedom they enjoy in the jungle?  Or is it some sort of social criticism on the part of the filmmaker?  The last line of the movie - ""i wonder who the real cannibals are"" - indicates that there was at least an attempt at a socio-political message.  The natives, in fact, are portrayed in a fairly favorable light, since they welcome the professor who comes to investigate the dissappearance of the four.  Although their customs are shocking, they are portrayed as having a strong sense of justice, which they adhere to very strictly.  The American filmmakers on the other hand, are simultaneously hypocritical, naive, and senselessly brutal (with the exception of the one female character).  Regardless, the social commentary of the film is nearly buried in the intense gore.  Which is the real reason why anyone would buy this movie in the first place.  I can understand why the movie was banned - the violence is not only extremely graphic but also quite realistically done.  I gave the movie four stars because it delivers 100% on the gore, and the weaknesses in plot and character development shouldn't be anything unexpected for gore and horror fans.",1135382400,3,1981,4.927710843373494

Many Italian horror fans have only heard of this one, or have had to watch it in varying degrees of quality via foreign laserdics or vhs.  This dvd is the best this is ever gonna look.  Cannibal Holocaust isn't so much a horror film as much as it is a gruesome adventure/drama.  Most Italian horror films, though gruesome, have a cheese element to them that gives them a humorous quality.  Cannibal Holocaust isn't really like that.  It's not the kind of Italian horror flick that you can watch with the guys, have a pizza and a chuckle over.  Some folks might chuckle in the beginning at some of the dubbing and dialog, but they won't be laughing by the end of the film.  In fact, whether you loved it or hated it, it's not the kind of movie you're just gonna shake off right after you watch it.  It does manage to get under your skin for better or for worse.  It does live up to it's reputation of being disturbing.  Sure, you got the two manly men below that claim to have not been affected by it, but most likely you will.  And yes, it's very brutal and very violent.  Fans of this genre already have an idea of what to expect in terms of violence, but those who don't watch these films will be apalled I'm sure.  Plus, they manage to make the violence look very realistic.  The murders at the end of the film are extremely well done, it's no wonder Ruggero was arrested for making a possible snuff film.  It's not real of course, but if you told someone it was, there's no reason they wouldn't believe you.  I think that might be why the animal stuff was done.  Using the real animal butchery does kind of make the other violent scenes seem real.  I'm also in the camp that doesn't care much for the animal stuff.  It is rather pointless, it's only purpose is shock, that's all.  And that's a rather underhanded and cheap way to shock.  The film is shocking enough as it is.  Extras are nice too.  An hour documentary with cast and crew as well as some seperate interviews that are around a half hour each.  Surprisingly, the documentary doesn't cover as much about the film as you think it would.  I thought Deadato would have an awful lot more to say.  Robert Kerman's interview is great.  He pretty much hates the film and Deodato as well!  Yet he does the commentary with Deodato which I'm interested in hearing asap.

2402279,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Well here it is at last, i've had the EC region 2 version for a while now and was curious to see what grindhouse would do with this, it's great how these smaller distributors go to all these lengths to remaster/remix these (relatively) obscure films but I wonder how much can you really do with a film that has such low production values in the first place? You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear (that is of course after you've tied the sow to a pole, kicked it and shot it)

 It was refreshing to learn that the actors didn't approve of the cruelty and I think the most valid point is made by one of the stars, when referring to the skewering of a live muskrat, ""does it make it a better film?"" well the answer is quite patently NO!

Deodato comes across as a rather cold individual who clearly puts no value on the suffering of other species. and while the film is, on the whole quite watchable, that aspect does leave a nasty taste compared say, to Fulci's ZOMBIE which is just great fun, now I know New York Ripper etc are sadistic but it's not real! That's the difference!

 It's like watching the destruction in INDEPENDENCE DAY or ARMAGEDDON which is fabulous and then saying the footage of the Twin Towers collapsing has the same entertainment value, it stops being fun when it's real.

Well done for the option then to view this without all the senseless cruelty.

Great packaging but i'm not convinced by the hype about printers refusing to handle the artwork, it's not that bad. Look at some death metal album covers, they seem to get away with it. Now come on Grindhouse and do the same with FEROX!!!",1131753600,2,1621,4.383333333333334
2402300,4,B000B5Y0CS,"I love how they have a special notice in the beginning about how they as the distributors of this movie think this is an incredibly irresponsible and offensive film of the type that should never have been made and should never be made again.  But we must promote free speech no matter how vile the voice may be. Then they give some quotes about free speech including Thomas Jefferson.

Yeah, we must remember the past so we will never be doomed to repeat it.  This movie is an abomination and we hope a movie like this never gets made again.

So, here's our 2 disc totally uncut special edition complete with director commentary.

You can tell they are truely sincere about this because they state that they have ""absolute sincerity""!

Too funny!

It's funny and yet a dangerous view of the force of the new liberal control forcing its values upon every one else.

As for the movie, I was entirely undisturbed by the ""animal cruelty"".  It showed people killing animals to eat them.  Not long ago families would behead chickens infront of their kids no matter how young.  But hide animal killings in a slaughterhouse or processing plant and suddenly society can't handle seeing it in a film.

As for all the rapes, forced abortion, castration, etc. they were done more convincing than other films I've seen (Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals and the laughably unconvincing I Spit On Your Grave).

I admit I've seen 4 of the 5 voted most disturbing movies of all time (and a respectable percentage of the top 50) and haven't been even slightly disturbed by any of them.  I just don't suspend my belief for films in this way.

For those who would be disturbed, I guess this is the most realistically gruesome film I've seen.

For my own taste, I prefer outrageous offensive films but movies of this type really aren't that enjoyable.  I prefer films that have a comedy or outrageousness to them aside from this kind of supposed ""disturbing content"".

For example, I enjoy films like ""Visitor Q"", ""Untold Story"", ""Terror Firmer"" and movies such as ""Salo"", ""Beyond the Darkness"" and the ""Guinea Pig Series"" usually just bore me.

For the type of movie this is, it is fairly interesting.  It is much better directed than other films I have seen of the Amazon cannibal genre.",1131321600,10,2268,4.679292929292929

Anyone who claims they can't watch it more than once a month are just plain wimps. I can't watch it more than once a year because it's so boring. It won't send shivers up your spine, it won't make you vomit, it won't make you turn away from the screen -- the only thing it might make you do is turn it off from sheer lack of excitement and/or interesting plot.",1131235200,3,678,4.183206106870229
2402302,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Grindhouse is slowly becoming the Criterion Collection of sleazy, drive-in cult classics. Ruggero Deodato's CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST has lied in limbo for quite some time. Just like Pasolini's SALO, both controversal films have not been banned in the USA, but a proper DVD has eluded us...until now!

Grindhouse did an excellent job here:

Picture: [A] HD remaster is superb though its not up to the standards of modern HD programming, its still nice to look at. A lot of effort went into this.

Sound: [A] Every line of dialogue, sound, and music cue came in loud and clear. Very nice. The music may sound different from earlier ""bootleg"" versions, perhaps a new orchestration but its not really noticeable.

Packaging: [B] DVD comes in a slip cover which reveals a slim case with the two discs on each side. No booklet or linear notes but instead a mini poster that on the other side has a greeting to the DVD buyer. A worthy introduction. Warning to those with children: The case is quite gory and unpleasant throughout.

Extras: [A+] here's where it gets really good! A commentary by Deodato and Robert Kerman with a video feed option, trailers from around the world, engaging documenatry and interviews, and even a music video. Some of it is in Italian with subtitles, so wacth out. Oh, and there are some still galleries but they play like slideshows overlaid with Riz Ortolani's creepy soundtrack. Check around for easter eggs. Hint: look for bonus trailers in the filmographies. The previews for possible future Grindhouse DVD's look nice and shlocky (the way I like it!).

Finally, the thing that really made me give the supplements extra points was the ""Animal Cruelty Free"" viewing option on the first disc containing the film. Kudos to Grindhouse for at least trying to make the film more accessible being that the animal torture scenes turned off many horror fans.

Get one now, supplies are limited. Mine was like 9777/11,111. So, they're on their way of being sold out. Don't get stuck with knockoffs, cheap imitations, and ridiculously high prices.",1131062400,11,2058,4.913544668587896
2402303,4,B000B5Y0CS,"The first time I saw the infamous Cannibal Holocaust I was under-impressed.  After all, I had heard so much about it and it didn't quite live up to everything that had been said about it.  Then again, I had seen the Substance dvd version, which left much to be desired as far as visual quality.

Upon reading about the film again in Jay Slater's ""Eaten Alive"" book, I decided to give the film another shot.  I watched the Substance dvd again and realized that this truly was an impressive film.  It really is hard to watch, it really is brutal, it really is unflinching and disturbing.  I almost felt bad for sitting through it.

I was thrilled to receive the Grindhouse 2-disc edition in the mail.  The packaging is unbelievable, although the first disc was loose in my package also (although it plays fine).  The film itself looks amazing and the entire second disc of extras is worth the price alone.

Buy this now before you're paying $75 on ebay for it.",1130716800,4,958,4.517441860465116
2402304,5,B000B5Y0CS,"I'm not going to spend a lot of time time on plot synopsis and what not, there are is enough written about this movie, I would rather just get to the DVD package.

  This has not been an easy DVD to find until now. There has been one from Europeon Cinema which I have not seen and one from Revok which I did see. While the Grindhouse DVD is not perfect, it blows the latter out of the water

  The case looks pretty cool. It is book shaped, has cardboard on the outside and plastic inside. The front of the cover shows the infamous image the woman impaled on a wooden stake. The only complaint I have is that the case is kind of tricky to close. Also, upon recieving the DVD in the mail I noticed the first disc was loose. It doesn't appear to be scratched so that didn't bother me too much.

  The video and audio quality are way better than anything I have seen. The new video transfer shows how well this movie was actually shot and shows a much sharper contrast between the first half of the movie and the 16 milimeter documentary footage of the second half. The soundtrack is excellent in stereo but if you prefer the original mono soundtrack it is available on the second track.

  Next is the extras. While the commentary and interviews are informative they are not exactly entertaining. The commentary is by no means as good as a Kevin Smith or Bruce Cambell commentary. It features star Robert Kerman and director Ruggero Deodatto. Deodatto's english isn't fantastic(he sometimes uses a translator) and Kerman isn't the sharp articulate professor type you see in the movie. Thats not to say he is dumb, he just doesn't talk as much as Deodatto. That aside it is interesting to hear, and thanks to selected on-screen commentary, see the tension between the star and director (more on that later). My favorite part was seeing the two watch the muskrat scene. Kerman, who most likely hadn't seen the movie in decades clearly can't stand it and even tries to lay a guilt trip on Deodatto.

  The second disc starts with an Italian Documentary. Aside from the segment in which they talk about the charges brought up against Deodatto by his own country, plus a few anecdotes here and there, this documentary is nothing too terribly exiting. Add the fact that you have to read subtitles and I give this part a 3/5 stars. The interviews are a lot better. One is with the soundrack composer and is in Italian with english subtitles. This is informative and appropiatly short. Another is with Gabriel York, who played Alan Yates. It provides a good American perspective of the making of the documentary part of the film. York shows little or no pride in his involvement with the film.

  My favorite extra on the second disc is the interview with Robert Kerman. This was shot four or five years before the commentary. Kerman appears to be a tad on the crazy side and at times rambles on. He clearly states his his hatred for Deodatto and this movie and blames it for ruining his career. He more than anyone else interviewed, is clearly upset by the animal killings and even suggests that Grindhouse remove the muskrat scene.

  That leads me to the most notable feature on the set, the animal cruelty free option. In my opinion, this is what keeps this film from being a classic. I myself can't stand these scenes but at the same time don't want anyone to tell me what I can and can't watch so I am very pleased with this option. It also shows the films ability to shock and disturb without them. This is not pulled off perfectly though, if you try to skip or scan it reverts back to the original mode.

  While it is not quite up to the standards of an Anchor Bay release this package is more than anyone has offered us on DVD and for the quality of the presentation and the animal cruelty free option this DVD is well worth the money.",1130630400,7,3835,4.469153515064562
2402305,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust is like a horrible traffic accident that you can't look away from, no matter how much it disturbs you. The movie is unrelentingly sick, and that' the entire point.

It's not great cinema, and it doesn't intend to be. It strives primarily to shock and disgust you, so be forewarned: this is not for theose with weak stomachs. You've been warned.

This is also not a movie for animal lovers. If you're a card carrying member of PETA, stay the hell away. For me personally, the most disturbing scene in the movie is the murder of the muskrat. It's graphic, cruel, horrible, and (most importantly) real. A man holds the animal in the palm of his hand, and then stabs it repeatedly while it squeals and squirms. A giant turtle has its head cut off while it's limbs continue to jerk and convulse while it is subsequently gutted and ripped apart. A cute little monkey gets its skullcap cut off before it is tossed around to be eaten.

It's all gratuitous and nasty, and it will disgust you.

Nevertheless, the authentic and disgusting murder of the animals in this movie is not without purpose or meaning. There's an unavoidable parallel between the brutality of these murders and the infamously gory conclusion to the film. The hideous nature of the animal killings intentionally desensitizes you to the following violence.

The movie comes across as a parable about the Vietnam war, and the intended message is blatant and obvious. The scenes where the documentary crew burns the cannibals alive in their huts make that much clear.

While the movie indulges in the torture and horrible murder of the crew, you aren't supposed to feel sorry for them, and it's pretty hard to not hate them. They are just as overtly barbaric as the cannibals. They rape and murder the natives, all the while smiling and obviously enjoying themselves in an almost juvenile and playful way. In a way they deserve it, and you pretty much want them to get it.

Still, you'd have to be pretty sick to cheer the cannibals on while they torture, mutilate, and even castrate the crew. The movie does a good job at manipulating your emotions there, and in doing so makes a statement about the varying manifestations of evil through their collisions. Everyone's a cannibal in the movie.

The packaging and content of this DVD are incredible. Limited to only 11,111 copies, the DVD is a lovingly presented gift for all the sick Cannibal Holocaust fans out there. There's a second disc of special features, which include, among other things, interviews with the director (who was originally arrested immediately after the Italian release of the movie). The picture quality is incredible, and the overall presentation of the film is almost undeservedly deluxe, and is an indespensible addition to any gore fanatic's collection. Given the relatively small and cultish fanbase that this movie caters to, I wouldn't expect it to become very hard to find any time soon, but I'd highly recommend it.

Still, as I said, you've been warned.",1130371200,6,3015,4.8388349514563105

2402308,2,B000B5Y0CS,"Cannibal Holocaust (Ruggero Deodato, 1980)

The mother of all cannibal films. This is the one that inspired Lenzi, D'Amato, and all the other folks who came up with cannibal flicks during the eighties. As such, it's got some archival value to it, but not terribly much more.

As is the case with most of the late seventies-early eighties low budget horror flicks of this nature, the film stock had degraded somewhat by the time anyone to round to putting this one on a DVD, so it looks painfully dated. Even so, a pristine copy would still show all the hallmarks of low-budget film; the editing is amateurish, the acting terrible, etc. (And this is in the frame scenes; the actual ""documentary"" is supposed to look this way.) The basic story is that an anthropologist visiting a primitive tribe recovers footage shot by a documentary crew who went to study the same tribe, brings it back, and puts it together into a film, which is then screened by the anthropologist and a few studio execs. The movie is roughly half and half, with the documentary comprising the latter half of the film (a two-minute frame piece is after the documentary, but seems as if it were tacked on as an afterthought). Thus, you can safely assume the first half of this film is going to move at a glacial pace. The real action (and the exploitation) gets going with the documentary footage, roughly forty-five minutes into the film.

To say the least, there is a select audience for this movie. Cruelty to animals (and one's fellow humans), rape, pillaging, murder, cannibalism (of course), you name it. It's not surprising the film was banned in Italy, Australia, Finland, and various other countries (interestingly, IMDB mentions it is one of Japan's top ten grossing films in history); it originally received an X rating in the United States, but was ultimately released unrated. Definitely of the ""endurance test"" school of cinema, but lacks the consistent action (found, say, in Lenzi's Cannibal Ferox), strong storyline, or acting ability to be anything more than a curiosity at this point. Even Joe d'Amato did it better in Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals, and that's saying something. * ",1128988800,7,2173,4.864864864864865
2402309,5,B000B5Y0CS,"Filmed in the deep, harsh jungles of Amazonia in 1979, Ruggero Deodato's cannibal tale is a gritty film that also has something to say about it's own excesses and extremes when taken in regards to the media and how it portrays violence.

Grindhouse Releasing's new October 25th release, which has been dealt with much critisiscm due to it's numerous delays, has had 8 printers worldwide refuse handling their artwork due to the supposed offensive nature of the inside of the cover art. This would not be the first time this film has been met with such regard; Deodato and company were originally hauled off to court to prove the all-to-convincing effects weren't real.

The film is purportedly banned in over 60 countries, and that simple fact alone has only added to it's notoriety; in 1995, Lucertola Media in Germany printed only 1000 copies of it's haunting, incredible soundtrack, which may be one of the best ever realized for this kind of film. The film itself has popped up in many countries, in a surprising amount of cropped and various forms, leaving some left in wonder and doubt as to what it's true uncut form really is. Many believed at one point there was a version including the infamous ""pirahna baiting"" sequence, but it has since been learned that scene was only photographed, and never actually shot.

There are two narratives which drive the film; it's second half takes on a pseudo-documentary style exactly as that seen in ""The Blair Witch Project."" This is also the most harrowing part of the film. It's first half consists of a New York City Professor who is sent to the jungles in search of four missing documentary filmmakers. He is led on this journey by a guide and a Yacumo prisoner, who ""is like a passport into the green inferno.""

The Last Road To Hell sequence, notorious and infamous in it's own right due to the fact that much of the footage is supposedly real, (shot out of Uganda), and this sequence is the very bridge that fills gap between the first and second half. This is the sequence that introduces us to the ""footage"" that is found by the filmmakers, which in turn, leads us into the films most devestating aspects. There are many ghastly atrocities commited in the first half of the film, but what proceeds to unfold in it's final half hour/45 minutes is nothing compared ot the first.

The film still stands today as a grueling testimony to the ugliness of 70's ultra violent exploitation filmmaking; it is remarkable viewing, but it's also not for everyone. Everything you have heard about this film stands true on it's own terms, and is a must see for anybody with the stomach to take it.

8081946,4,B000B5Y0CS,"Though shocking and grotesque, the film 'Cannibal Holocaust' does manage to bring up some pretty valid points. When viewing this film as a criticism or metaphor of: colonialism,  American sensationalist culture, or simply a statement on exploitation films, the experience becomes much more thought provoking and engaging.",1526688000,,321,5.829787234042553
8081947,5,B000B5Y0CS,"By one of those lucky accidents in life, I ran into this movie while leisurely browsing online. It immediately brought back childhood memories of me walking inside a video club, and seeing the movie box in the shelves, but my brothers would never let me rent it. The images I saw back then were so powerful that they stuck to my brain to this day, as sure enough, they came back as soon as I got back in touch with this little diddy.

When I started reading more about it, my curiosity burst into flames. I just had to watch it. And I am so glad I did. This is not just a stunning work of gore, its a masterpiece! Everything about this movie is incredible: from the genius found footage concept idea (the first of its kind! honestly, how cool is that?... take that Blairs witch!), its intriguing ultimate message, and of course, all the glorious non-stop carnage. Deodato takes no prisoners. This film goes all the way like its publicity says!

I found the decision of using Robert Kerman as the leading actor an odd one (but one that in the end, worked). By the late seventies, Kerman had not really done anything of importance except porn (the notorious Debbie Does Dallas at that, one of the most famous movies of that genre), so he was a non-obvious choice, to say the least. I think he does a decent job in this film, in part probably because hes someone who wouldnt feel intimidated by its gruesome nature (and definitively would not bother being groped by a group of enthusiastic native women). His acting is all you would expect from a porn actor, stiff (pun intended) and subpar, but after all it serves the purpose, because this is not a film about great acting, but about great being (especially in regard to the cannibals).

Filming real native tribes (I doubt they were actual cannibals) appears to many as an unsurmountable challenge. How the hell do you direct natives on film? The answer, surprisingly, is pretty simple, and its given by Deodato in the full length commentary. You just ask them and they obey. As simple as that. They do whatever they are told. Apparently, being on camera (whether they understood what it meant or not) was a real treat for the natives, and they all were making fun among themselves thinking these light skin people were crazy! But, free meals and lots of fun, hey who would say no to that??

The extra materials in this DVD are a real treat which makes it a must for real fans. The booklet contains two posters of the movie in different languages and some liner notes. The audio commentary was very revealing, particularly of the personalities of Deodato and Robert Kerman. They ended up being the total opposite of what I expected them to be. You would think of Kerman, as the alpha male porn star, pricky, arrogant, full of himself, but instead heres this sweet, insecure, slightly depressed quiet little man. On the other hand, I was thinking of Deodato as the humble, professional, introvert director, but he happened to be all what I thought Kerman would be. Blunt, stuck up, and quite a jerk at times. Throughout the commentary audio, you could tell that Robert just couldn't stand being with that guy. He must hate Deodato with a passion. There was zero chemistry between the two. To make things worst, between Deodatos broken English and Kermans one word per minute speech pace, the commentary was very painful to listen to. Its contents could also have been more interesting. I think there were far better things to discuss than what was included, so tragically, this commentary was a lost opportunity.

Now lets move on to the on-camera interviews. Kermans interview produced in me a shock only comparable to watching the movie for the first time. Now it makes sense why there is virtually no interview of him to be found anywhere in the internet. I wonder if he ever gave interviews at all. The conversation starts with Kerman sitting at the weirdest, most uncomfortable angle with respect to the camera, so you can see him most of the time almost from behind. Hes sitting in front of a mirror, so you can see the camera (and Kerman) reflected on the mirror all the time (seriously!?). Its all so unprofessional that it looks like a 3-year old set the whole thing up. Later, the cameraman moved to another, slightly better angle, revealing that the interview is taking place in a locker room of sorts, where you can see things thrown over the floor everywhere. Kermans appearance is thoroughly pathetic, he obviously did not care about his looks at all (I wonder if they even told him this would be a filmed interview, as opposed to just audio). He keeps on sipping his coffee making annoying noises, rubbing his face, and speaking at the aforementioned one word per minute pace. All those years in porn must have eaten half of his brain away! In the end, the interview leaves you with a bitter taste, you can tell that his life nor his acting career went where he wanted them to go. He gives the impression of being a total failure in life. And it looks that he didn't even like the movie after all!

The other interviews were much better. Yorkes interview was by far the best of the three, giving a structured narrative of the whole filming process, unlike Kermans which was a hot mess. The rest of the extra materials in the second DVD are really tasty for a fan of the film.

Finally, I want to talk about the music, composed by Riz Ortollani. Part of what makes Cannibal so epic is precisely this soundtrack masterpiece. The main theme and many of the incidental pieces are not the dissonant cheap scares you would think (though there is some dissonance in the sound at some point), but rather some of the sweetest, most melodic music of its time. It may sound funny, but the continuous use of the pew pew bite works extremely well and one of the most original ideas for a horror movie soundtrack ever! I guarantee you, it will stick to your head for weeks after youve heard it. The extreme contrast of the brutality of the scenes and the ethereal music is part of what makes this movie so powerful and memorable. Deodato himself has said that this approach was borrowed from him by directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Oliver Stone to recreate the overly dramatic effect. I imagine it could also be the inspiration behind the final scene of The Mission by Roland Joffe.

Deodato is unquestionably a legendary director. He deserves much more praise than he gets. Maybe its the kind of movies that he chose to make what relegated him to cult director status. However, Cannibal is far from being the B movie garbage that many people think it is. Leaving aside the gruesome gore and the obscenely graphic scenes (not speaking about the infamous animal butchery, of which Deodato does not seem all that regretful in his interview it looks as if hes just sorry that he was caught); the theme, rhythm, shock and ultimate message of this movie are all of everlasting value, and this film will always be among the most dreadful, daring, horrendously delicious pieces of degenerate art there will be. And if you want to know who the real cannibal was, his name is Ruggero Deodato!",1525046400,,7140,4.620961386918833
8081948,4,B000B5Y0CS,"This is the only movie I've ever seen that gave that heart pumping anxiety.  I know there is actual real footage that is much worse, but I don't watch those kinds of things. I found it ironic that an Italian made this film about Americans since the worst savagery of western civilization was committed by Ancient Romans and as far as I know it's not customary for young Americans to go off to the Amazon with a mind to terrorize natives. Another irony is that the filmmaker was actually filming the future scene of one of histories most savage acts, which was perpetrated on Americans at the World Trade Center. So the final commentary ""who are the real savages?"" ended up being a terrorist. If anything I think this film gives civilization a dose of humanity at it's lowest possible level and destroys the romanticism of ""going native"" which is so often portrayed in western cinema. The most recent example is ""Lost City of Z"" which portrays Percy Fawcett's death at the hands of the natives as a kind of mystical end that Percy welcomed. In reality it was probably more like Cannibal Holocaust with Percy and his son meeting the worst kind of end. The fact is the meanings in the film are nonsensical, because in truth everybody involved in this film probably didn't trade their homes in society and go off and join the cannibal tribe. Are they so comfortable in their life that they have to invent outlandish comparisons? I'm sure you could also take the communist approach as well and say the film is about American capitalism and how the Americans are driven, as portrayed by the 4 journalists, to commit savage acts to achieve monetary gains. Once again, it's nonsensical because that is not reality because if was reality they wouldn't have to use a fictional story to achieve their message. Despite that, I will say the film succeeded where almost all films fails, which is somewhere in it is some deeper truth about life and humanity that might not be utterly clear, but regardless you feel it.",1524441600,,2003,4.674220963172805

8081954,2,B000B5Y0CS,"Donno how innovative by the time this movie first came out but watching this movie in 2018 seems like it's a totally fake unrealistic movie to me.
All the torturing scenes were fakish and I never felt anything from them.
Two hours was just boring to me.
They should make this film again this time really realistically.
Shame on the movie.",1522886400,,338,4.557377049180328
