8534768,2,B000FFT6Z0,"DVD came in an envelope with no case - only a paper sleeve. Can't expect much more for $2.95. No narration - no sound, no captions. Some good footage though. If you were to view this DVD not knowing there was an earthquake and fire in San Francisco in 1906, you'd have thought it was bombed. Shows well the destruction and devastation. This DVD would be a good candidate for a knowledgeable narration and better editing.",1165622400,4,420,4.5394736842105265
