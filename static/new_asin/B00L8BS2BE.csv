8664281,3,B00L8BS2BE,"Always looking for good evangelical tools but like so many of these movies the producers try to cram every possible scenario into the one film. The young actor playing the lead is excellent but others are a bit ham, some very! However the group of youth I showed it to age 13-17 mostly really enjoyed it and it provoked some good questions.",1426550400,2,340,4.5

8664283,3,B00L8BS2BE,"I found this movie to be something of a jumble of ideas. Characters in the movie seem to be important and then lose their importance as the film goes on. Many of them are plot devices only in order to move the story where the writer wants it to go. One character in particular, the absent step-father, could have been eliminated altogether. That's a shame because he could have had a great effect on the movie had he been used to contrast the father who really wasn't there. One father can't be there for his kids while the other one can but is too selfish to do so. A really dramatic point was completely abandoned. I expected that the youth pastor would have some positive effect on the life of the troubled teen. He did, but only off camera and in ways that were not explained well. He just drifted out of the picture until he was needed to preach a salvation message. The love interest had no dramatic moment at all. The love birds started holding hands and smiling at each other. But, when the troubled teen was trying to sort out the dramatic event that was to change his perspective on his parents, she wasn't involved at all. Neither was the youth pastor. Neither was his mother. God didn't even seem to show up. He just got over it. I didn't totally buy the big reveal about his absent father either. It didn't seem to be realistic that the father could have  pulled that off for so many years. The younger boy had an important role to play, too, but his character was under utilized and, as the kid who can't play baseball well, was hackneyed. His hitting the home run at the end had no purpose except to make me feel good at the end...When the baseball game was the major scene of parental neglect that could have led him down the same  troubled path his big brother was headed down. This was another missed opportunity. I also didn't buy the homeless guy's sage advice about ""living the dash"" because  He wasn't doing that. He was avoiding the dash. This would have been more believable if it had been said by the youth pastor and if the teen had confronted the homeless guy with this message, only to have the homeless guy take that to heart and end up turning the teen's world upside down and spinning him into emotional turmoil.

I gave this movie three stars though because the acting was good by actors who didn't have a lot of experience themselves. They made the characters real, which made the missed opportunities in the plot all the more evident. The mother and the two boys were especially good. I hope they get more opportunities to be in other films. The production values were also good, especially the short war scene, which had me believing that it was shot in some foreign country instead of in some local venue (as I assume it was). This was a good effort, but the folks who made this movie would benefit from some script editing by real, experienced professionals before filming their next movie. (I'm not a professional film writer and I saw the flaws.)",1410134400,4,2985,4.471559633027523
