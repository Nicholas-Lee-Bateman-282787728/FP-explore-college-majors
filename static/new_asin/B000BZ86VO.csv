8094669,5,B000BZ86VO,"I ordered this album because I am a HUGE fan of Tokio Hotel. I am soooo in love with Tom Kaulitz, the guitarist of the group. Bill, Georg and Gustav are amazing in their own way but there is just something special about Tom. He's so beautiful. But I am happy my DVD arrived ahead of schedule =] and if I find some more TH stuff from this seller, I definitely will buy from them again.",1392854400,,384,4.065789473684211
8094670,5,B000BZ86VO,"I'm not sure what else to say besides it's very nice. If you like Tokio Hotel, you will like this. Personally I like THTV and Zimmer the best. But this one is nice too.",1328400000,,168,3.9705882352941178
8094671,4,B000BZ86VO,"Even if you don't understand German (sorry no subtitles - but ya don't really need em) you'll just have  to watch and enjoy their energy while you watch this semi bio type docu-promo DVD that includes the music video ""Durch den Monsoon"" plus a totally hot, jaw dropping, symphonic concert performance of ""Durch den Monsoon"" and ""Schrei"", other concert footage, the music video ""Schrei"", and the making of it.  There are old clips, live concert performances, commentary, a picture gallery, a question and answer clip, more live performances  You'll be amazed to see how young they started out at and get to watch as they start growing up.  There's a lot off stuff on  this DVD. I don't understand German but liked it immensely none the less.  I guess they're having the same effect on me as they are on their French fans.  I want to learn some German now cuz of them.  I don't know about this copy but mine is in PAL standard which cannot be played back on US machines.  If you're American look for it in NTSC format.  In case you're wondering I'm not a bopper either.  I'm over 50 and a dude!  America needs to get charged by them the same way they're electrifying Europe.",1188086400,24,1172,4.5285714285714285
