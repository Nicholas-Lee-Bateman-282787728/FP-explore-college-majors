The film is good, but I don't really get the humor behind it. I'm probably not the right target for this film, but the dry humor wasn't making me laugh or giggle.

I thought the acting was good. The don was convincing. Art of Love kind of reminded me of Dollhouse and The Godfather, just strictly about sex. If you are a fan of dry humor, I recommend this film.",1341273600,,481,4.117021276595745
