5775649,5,B00D6I7IPI,"I have virtually everything Waylon ever recorded, and the songs on this are repeats of ones I already had.  But the picture on the cover was worth the cost of the album.  I should have realized there would not be any new songs since he died in 2002.",1379203200,,249,4.166666666666667
5775650,5,B00D6I7IPI,"Watching Waylon lifts you high, murmurs in your ears, wraps his mouth, his throat and hisself around every note, pause, syllable, and feeling in every single song. True this is one single concert, but the energy is so high and his voice so rich, evocative and naughty/sly that mixing different performances together would only dilute the power and fun of Waylon Jennings playing his songs for the folks! We loved every bit of this DVD and fervently hope more concerts surface. We cannot get enough!",1378425600,,498,4.870588235294117
5775651,5,B00D6I7IPI,"You can't say enough about the Hoss, this is a great dvd. The picture and sound is great and it feels like your right their live watching the show. If you like Waylon music you won't go wrong it was awesome entertainment.",1378166400,,221,4.285714285714286
5775652,1,B00D6I7IPI,"This DVD is very mis-leading.....It is not at all what it is packaged to be, This is the same concert as the Lost Outlaw Performance at the Grand Ole Opry House in 1978.... the quality is very poor..... Thought I had found another early concert by Waylon but the joke is on me.... If you want a good copy of this concert Find the Lost Outlaw Performance",1377907200,8,353,4.2835820895522385
5775653,2,B00D6I7IPI,the description stated that this DVD was from various concerts in Waylon's career. I was very disappointed with the wording . Waylon is always good but I already have this . This DVD description was off a mile. I think that this really will caution me in the future when getting music from Amazon.,1377475200,14,297,4.518518518518518
5775654,3,B00D6I7IPI,"This DVD is the 1978 concert that is already available on DVD.  This DVD is not a musical documentary.  I thought this would be songs from different times in the 1970's, but it is not.",1377475200,14,184,4.228571428571429

8590029,3,B00D6I7IPI,I too am disappointed and agree with most of the comments regarding this.  It is a replica of the Lost Outlaw performance - minus the credits and of poor quality.  I thought too that I had found one different from what I have but that didn't turn out to be so.  Don't waste you money on it!,1385596800,4,290,4.052631578947368
8590030,5,B00D6I7IPI,"Excellent delivery and price. As one of Waylon's fans, it was good to watch him just as I remember him. Just as I've come to expect from Amazon.",1381449600,,144,4.178571428571429
8590031,5,B00D6I7IPI,Waylon couldn't disappoint.  Have loved all of his music and always looking for that rare album of songs not previously released or re-released original vinyl albums transferred to cd.  A great disc.  Thank you.,1379980800,,211,5.147058823529412
