There seemed to be some biblical references, personally I take no offense to this.  The idea of the first Toa, or Glatorians, battling each other is a concept I thought wouldn't have been introduced into the Bionicle movies.  It was nice.

3909906,2,B002D755C6,"It had been four years since I'd seen the release of a new Bionicle movie. After waiting for what had seemed like forever, Bionicle gave me the fourth installment in its movie series, Bionicle: The Legend Reborn. But does this movie truly deserve to live in your movie collection?

The story starts off when we're introduced to Mata Nui: a Bionicle who had recently dropped from the god of his own universe to a simple warrior on the plains of Bara Magna. The first scene is shot from what seems to be Mata Nui's homeland. After a while, a mask lands in the desert area millions of lightyears away. It is here where the mask assembles a body out of dust and dirt and becomes Mata Nui.

Along the way, Mata Nui meets a desert beetle--which he would later named Click and also use as a shield--Metus, Raanu, Ackar, and Kiina. Metus is a cocky Agori who likes to make business, Ackar is the ruler of his own village, Ackar is a nearly-retired Glatorian fighter, and Kiina is a Glatorian desperate to get away from Bara Magna.

Later in the story, Mata Nui, Kiina, and Ackar head into Kiina's village: Tajuun. Unfortunately, they discover the village was raided by Bone Hunters and Skrall: the two main antagonists of this story. It is here where they run into a Glatorian named Gresh and a mischeivous Agori named Berix. Shortly after meeting Berix, we discover that he and Kiina have squabbles with each other.

It is before making their way to Gresh's homeland when Mata Nui blesses his friends with the elemental powers similar to those of the toa powers from the first three movies. After this, the Glatorians are able to convince the Agori to start a war against the Bone Hunters and Skrall.

At the end of the movie, we come to a slightly unsurprising twist.

To be completely honest, I hate this movie. There is only one thing I found about it that spat on the old movies: the visuals. Everything else is terrible. For example: the music is bad, most of the actors are terrible, and the humor of the movie is just way too childish for my taste.

If you ask me, there are only three things you should do with this movie. These three things are the following: don't buy it, sell it to somebody who doesn't care for Bionicle, or smash it with a hammer. All this said, Bionicle: The Legend Reborn is NOT a good movie and should NOT be bought by anybody.",1322092800,2,2353,4.470862470862471
3909907,5,B002D755C6,"Both Janda (the actress) and Wajda (the director) met before. Both of them have high profile in polish culture. In 2010 they teamed again to create this little masterpiece. It's dedicated to Janda's husband who had died before the filming begun.
Janda portrayes two characters here: herself and Marta.
In both cases she delivers amazing performance. Her monologues based on her personal life are moving and won't leave you indifferent.
It's a quiet and very modest enterprise about life, love, death, sadness, emptiness after loss. With marvellous pictures, direction and music. Kudos for all actors in supporting roles.

It has some very good moral moments and points considerably towards male integrity and honor.

3909915,4,B002D755C6,"The story begins where the original comics end: MataNui, a god to his people, has been cast out of his own enormous body by his traitorous brother, Makuta Teridax (though the film never mentions his name). Trapped within the legendary Mask of Life, MataNui (voiced wonderfully by Michael Dorn) is banished to the depths of space, only to crashland on the (not-actually-so-distant) desert planet of BaraMagna. Once he awakens and the Mask forms for him an all-new body, he quickly meets many new friends and foes alike.

Ackar (Jim Cummings) is an older, highly experienced Glatorian, a race of mighty warriors employed as mercenaries and combatants. After his life is saved by a golden-armored new-comer in the arena, the two team up with other Glatorian, Kiina and Gresh, as well as the collector Barix, in a quest to save Bara Magna from the Bone Hunters and Skrall, and help Mata Nui to return to his homeworld to save his people from the tyrannical rule of the Makuta.

1 point off for the horribly-animated water in the very beginning, and another for the still-thriving island of Mata Nui, which in the comics was left a barren wasteland devoid of any signs of life (this was necessary to awaken the being MataNui).
I won't spoil any major plot points, but the 1.25 hour movie does end on a cliffhanger, leaving plenty of room for at least one sequal.
Action is in no short supply, acting is solid, and plot is plentiful in this latest installment of the BIONICLE storyline, and I personally can't wait to see what happens to our newest heroes as their journey continues.",1257033600,4,1577,4.751824817518248
3909916,1,B002D755C6,"Let it never be said that I am overly unfair in my reviews or that I am anything less than a true blue BIONICLE fan. I have followed the franchise quite eagerly since its inception in 2001, when I was just an 11-year-old boy who happened to receive the first BIONICLE comic book packaged with the new issue of LEGO Magazine. I remember the 2003 release of Mask of Light quite fondly, and I still find the film rather enjoyable all these years later. 2004's release of Legends of Metru Nui thrilled me even more, as I quickly discovered that Toa Lhikan is arguably the best character ever to appear in BIONICLE canon. 2005's release of the last movie, Web of Shadows, was also highly enjoyable, as the series took a nice dark turn. I eagerly anticipated the release of the next movie, but it never came until now.

I suppose my first warning sign should have been when I looked at the back of the box and saw the logo of some no-name studio I'd never heard of in place of the familiar Miramax logo, but I didn't care too much; I popped the DVD into my laptop and sat down to watch.

The first few minutes of the film are actually acceptable; everything shown before Mata Nui gets exiled from his own body is roughly on par in terms of animation quality and writing with the previous Miramax films. Mata Nui's arrival on Bara Magna is similarly nice, right up until he finishes making a body for himself, at which point the film moves down from ""acceptable"" into ""mediocre"" and doesn't stop moving down until it reaches the end, which I would give a name except it would likely result in me being banned from all civilized conversation for a period of no less than five years. Michael Dorn, who voices Mata Nui, did a reasonable job during the intro voice-over, but unfortunately seems to be trying to play the character using a voice that suggests a horribly-done combination of Dan Green and Peter Cullen.

At first I thought I'd merely have to deal with an poorly-acted main protagonist, so I wasn't too worried, but then more characters were introduced and I realized that I was dealing with a poorly-acted film. ""This has to be a record,"" I thought. ""I don't think I've ever seen a movie that I desperately wanted to end after watching only the first ten minutes.""

The film appears to suffer from poor voice acting all around, but I'm not entirely sure that's a fair accusation, because voice acting can only be so good when you're forced to read some of the blandest and most unnatural dialogue imaginable. Arguably the best voice acting in the film comes from the characters who are actually supposed to be annoying: since the characters were deliberately supposed to make me want to shatter my screen with a golf club, I'd say they can declare Mission Accomplished on that count.

As for other counts, I have to attack the film's visual style now, being that film is supposed to be a visual medium. While I will admit that the characters themselves are extremely well-animated, the rest of the film ISN'T. The character animation quality has received a solid step up from the older films, while the environments has been downgraded to roughly third-rate-PS2-launch-title graphics quality, and the contrast is rather jarring, though not as jarring as it could be, since the character animation quality starts to become distinctly inconsistent during battle sequences.

And now we're onto the battle sequences. The previous films had battle scenes that actually looked somewhat like actual actors performing a well-choreographed fight scene, the kolhii match-of-death from Mask of Light notwithstanding. This new film, however, seems to have decided that the best possible fight sequences should look less like people fighting and more like toys fighting, and the resulting battles come off looking unnatural and uninteresting, rarely involving the dramatic poses and awesome acrobatics that previous films like Web of Shadows featured. I'll show you what I mean: early on, Mata Nui, having just formed himself into a full body, finds himself in a fight with a savage beast called a Vorox. Near the beginning of the battle, Mata Nui finds himself quickly thrown down onto his back, trying to avoid the Vorox's stinger tail as it whips down at him. The first time, he rolls to the right, then rolls back to the center. The second time, he rolls to the left in almost the same exact way, then rolls back to center. The third, he rolls to the right AGAIN, using almost the same animation as the first time, and then rolls back to center AGAIN, followed by him blocking the fourth attempt with his new shield, which causes the stinger to break off entirely and causes the Vorox to flee. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU MAKE AN INTERESTING BATTLE, EVEN IF YOUR HERO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT YET.

This review is already running a little long, so I'm going to flash through the remaining points at the same time, which is convenient, since they're essentially the same category anyway: the sound. Any and all sound in the film. The sound effects all seem to have been pulled from the ""stock cartoon noises"" pile, while the music is lacks any of the majesty or power that the Miramax films put into their soundtrack, settling instead for what really comes off sounding like a stock cartoon soundtrack.

About the only thing that could possibly anger me more than this movie is the fact that Tinseltown Toons, the studio responsible for this festering pile of shovelware, has already been contracted to do the NEXT TWO BIONICLE MOVIES. If this doesn't scream ""prematurely killing the franchise"", I don't know what does.",1256342400,6,5605,4.735655737704918

3909918,5,B002D755C6,"Have both long-time fans of the Bionicle franchise as well as new fans in my household (11 year old and 5 year old) and they both loved this movie.  The production quality of the film was great, with the characters really coming to life, more so than in any of the previous films.  The story line was exciting and easy to follow for the new fan, while delivering on established storyline for our long-time Bionicle devotee.  All in all was even better than we expected and a film I am sure they will watch over and over.",1255305600,10,520,4.34020618556701
3909919,1,B002D755C6,"I am an adult, but I am a very involved parent so I get into what my two boys are into. We've been fans of Bionicles for 5 years now. We collect all of the construction sets and have pretty much every one. We play the lame video games. My kids even do jobs around the house to earn money so that they can buy the older sets off of Ebay, which have been discontinued. The previous three movies were extraordinarily good and we watched them countless times as they were something that they loved and that I could appreciate because there was real production quality; much like a Pixar production. I frequently marveled at all of the detail and the obvious passion that the production team put into these movies. To be honest, I enjoyed them as much as my kids; they're very entertaining and well crafted movies with great action, stories and tremendous production value.

However, this one changes all that. It was as if they hired some cheapo production company to capitalize on the franchise's potential to make a quick buck. Gone is the incredible character designs and wicked animations. Gone are the exciting action scenes. Gone is the great layout and cinematography. Gone is the solid voice acting. Gone is the excellent lighting effects. And most tragically, a complete thrashing of the tremendous quality in sound and score. These two areas where were the first 3 movies truly excelled. The scores in the first three movies were legitimate, well-crafted scores by a reputable Hollywood film composer. The score in this latest movie is so horribly bad and off the mark, it seemed as though it was thrown together by the director's 15 year old cousin hacking and slashing his way through Garage Band for the first time. It's really that bad.

The sound effects are even worse. They're just average, bland horse pucky which would be fine if this were a hackneyed Saturday morning cartoon, however the precedent set by the previous 3 movies makes the sound in this one an absolute crime. We watch these movies in our home theater and play them loud, so I used to really marvel at the sound work in the first 3 movies. It was really extraordinary. This one however, is so bad that these characters just aren't cool anymore. They're wimpy and delicate sounding and that makes them less cool not only in my eyes but in both my kids. One thing that I really notice in movies is that you can make a bad animation good with good sound and music, but if you have bad sound and music with bad animation, it's all just miserable, and this movie is exactly that: MISERABLE.

What once made my kid's jaws drop and got them excited and enthusiastic about animation and filmmaking in general, is now something we joke about in my house. My 9 and 6 year old boys rolling their eyes and throwing popcorn at the screen says it all. This movie is just plain awful and it made my kids passion for the toys diminish significantly. It's really sad and just makes me wish that we had skipped this one entirely.

3909920,1,B002D755C6,"As a huge fan of Bionicle I have been looking forward to this movie for ages. Unfortunately it blows on so many levels. The voice work is pretty cool but the actors are dealing with such cliched material that they can only take it so far. The camera work, as mentioned by another review here, is ordinary. Like the director fell asleep at key points during the shoot. The art and design is really cool in parts but what's with the crappy opening? A really poor finale for what has been a great series.",1253923200,7,501,4.340425531914893
3909921,4,B002D755C6,"This one is a bit of an odd trade-off. The first three Bionicle movies won praise for their directing, writing, music and sound design, but garnered criticism for their graphics, voice talent, and action. This movie is like the opposite of those movies. The voice acting is great (with two exceptions). All of the characters are voiced appropriately at the very least and artfully at the very most, except for Kiina, whose voice actress was unconvincing and sometimes annoying; and Tuma, whose voice actor did a fine acting job, but sounded inappropriate for the character. All of the characters are represented in this movie with three exceptions, but I don't mind that as the cast never felt cramped. The look of this film is beautiful. The artists who worked on this film show a religious dedication to toy accuracy, which cannot be said for any of the other films. Even the pins that hold the sets together spin. The environments are lush, and only one shot in the whole movie really stands apart from the others as bad looking. And the fight choreography is not only lengthy, it's exciting. Unfortunately, the camera work is not up to par with the fighting, content to sit still and watch the action happen rather than move with the characters in a meaningful way. The music in this film, while not terrible, could definitely have been better. And many of the sound effects are cheesy and instantly recognizable from a dozen other films, commercials, and computer games (the Wilhelm scream is in there, too). The actual writing of the movie is fine, but the story comes across more as part of a TV show's unfinished plot arc than a stand alone piece, and the ending of the movie confirms fears that the whole thing is a set-up for a sequel in what i suspect will be a trilogy. But, this movie's good points far outweigh its bad ones, and I found it to be highly enjoyable as a long time fan of both Bionicle and Michael Dorn (who plays the leading role). I recommend it.",1253664000,8,1975,4.62962962962963
3909922,5,B002D755C6,"Whoever thought that a toy line would become the star of a movie franchise?  (with the exception of GI Joe of course)

Years ago, when bionicles first hit the marketplace, and my boys discovered them,we always thought they would make a great film.  With CGI advances,they are now here.  Even if you do not know anything about the Bionicle line of toys, you will like this.

In terms of plot, Mata Nui, a great and powerful ruler at one time, helps win a monumental battle.  The local population asks him to help fight the Skrall and Bone Hunters.  There is bionicle action, great animation, and and excellent plot.  For those familiar with bionicles, the characters transform well to film especially when it comes to their high range of motion.  In one scene, Michael Dorn voices a character, and as in all animated films, reflects a Worf like pose.  It would take a Trek minded viewer to see that one though.

On the DVD, the bonus features include  ""Bye Bye Babylon"", ""Metus Revenge"" ending, a character gallery, and deleted scens.  The embossed cover is pretty cool too.

With every film these get better.  We look forward to the rest.

The movie is fantastic - it looks great (incredible animation for a direct-to-video title!) has a great cast, and is just a lot of fun. Sure, if you're not too familiar with the world it may take a few minutes to understand what's happening, but all in all, it's a very satisfying film. If you have young boys in the household it's perfect for them - although, I should add my little girl is walking around quoting it too - there's a strong female character in the movie as well that she really responded to. A very high quality and thoughtful production - definitely recommend!",1252972800,11,721,4.3088235294117645

LEGO ENDED THE SERIES IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE
THE SETS
MISTIKA/PHANTOKA
AND STARS WERE BOTH BAD
AND THIS MOVIE THAT CAME BEFORE
I DONT LIKE THE MASK AND HOW TOA DIED TO SAVE MATA NUI
ITS ALL BULL
CAUSE AFTER SEVERAL SACRIFICES WERE MADE, MAKUTA TAKES HES BODY AND FIRES OFF MATA NUI TO THREE PLANTS
LANDS ON ONE WERE THE PEOPLE THERE FIGHT FOR CONTROL
AND JUST LIKE THE MASK OF LIFE
HE MAKES A BODY
NOW THIS MOVIE HAS MISSING CHARACTERS
NO ELEMENTAL LORDS
HECK, MALUM ISNT EVEN REAL
INSTEAD ITS JUST A BUNCH OF BUGS
ALL TOGETHER, MEGA LAME
ODD MATA NUI DOESNT AWKEN ELEMENTAL POWERS TO THE OTHER HEROS
MATA NUI THEN FINDS A WAY HOME BUT IT ENDS
