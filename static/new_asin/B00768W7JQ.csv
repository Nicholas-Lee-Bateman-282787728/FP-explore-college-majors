8510778,5,B00768W7JQ,Jean Ashton's creative mind is at its best with this tidy little video that will help your child enjoy a good sleep and keep everyone in your household warm and fuzzy.  The live action work of the chicks and toys in this film bring back many of my fondest childhood memories.  The Mozart soundtrack is unsurpassed in creating a mood of wonder and tranquility.  This is a perfect video to share with your small child as you both drift off to peaceful and sleepy experience.,1388966400,2,472,4.529411764705882
