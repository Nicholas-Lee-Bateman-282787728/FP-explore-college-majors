7907329,1,B00000F9XS,"Okay first of all, we will forget that to remake or make a sequel to a movie of Alfred Hitchcock's is both obsurd and Stupid. . . Actually it is just plain WRONG! This sequel isn't even interesting as a curiosity item. It is so boreing! You can tell that it was made for television and it doesn't even really justify itsself as a made for tv movie. It just drags out with a cliche' storyline. Even the Tippi Hedren cameo isn't interesting. Save yourself the time, money, and effort. SAVE YOURSELF!",1102032000,,497,4.413043478260869
7907330,2,B00000F9XS,"If you're going to make a sequel to a film like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, you'd better try to at least match the original.  Ooops...director ""Alan Smithee"" (name given when a director pulls his name out) has no idea on how to build suspense, or sustain a mood of impending doom.  The birds seem about as threatening as Pee Wee Herman in a senior citizens club.  The pace is slow; the children are obnoxious.  In fact, the only likeable person is played by Jan Rubes and he's not in it very much.  Brad Johnson looks like someone just woke him up from a long winter's nap; Chelsea Field looks terrified of the camera; and James Naughton gives a phone in performance.  Poor Tippi Hedren..she's relegated to playing a clerk in a souvenir shop and she probably wondered why in the world she would participate in this poorly conceived mess.
Not recommended, even for fans of the original.  This one just goes nowhere.",1087516800,2,909,4.608695652173913
