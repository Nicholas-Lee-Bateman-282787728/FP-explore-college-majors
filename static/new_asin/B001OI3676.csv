8470716,4,B001OI3676,"A thought provoking film reflecting the real life challenges for a group of young men destined for a life contrary to the environments that enveloped their developmental years.

The realism of the film, brought into focus the personal impact of social economic indifferences in the lives of those that have limited choices.  The production was viewed from a evangelistic prospective in mind; however a separate but similar impact in the area of leadership training had to be noticed.

The Lord had Ezekiel sit in the place of the people to better understand what they felt; he was to be touched by the feeling of their infirmities.

Ezekiel 3:15 (KJV) Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.

This production is a must see for the church leadership, it will present a view of life most chose to look away from.
