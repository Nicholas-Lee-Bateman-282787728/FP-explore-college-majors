2443103,1,B000BVM1WI,"I am embarrased to be a human being. I cannot believe this movie was made. It is the most worthless piece of garbage ever thought of and produced. Who let this slip by? This , my friends, is what is considered enterntainment in 2006. Who is Nick Cannon, and why does anyone believe he is an actor? If he's an actor, I'm about to make it big in Hollywood. Do not waste your time, people. For the love of god, I beg you!!!!!!",1137456000,7,423,4.108433734939759
2443104,2,B000BVM1WI,"There's nothing new in Underclassman. Not good plot, the acting is below average, and the jokes fall flat. It wants to be a mix between 21 Jump Street and Bad Boys, but it's really neither. It's made for teens, and I'm not sure if they'd even like it.",1130544000,3,251,4.25
2443105,4,B000BVM1WI,"To be honest, I was skeptical when I first saw the previews of this movie. I thought it would be pretty lame. But I really enjoyed this movie . I thought the plot of this movie was very funny and realistic. Except for the part about Rosalyn Sanchez characer and Nick Cannon character getting together that a little over the top. But otherwise, Underclassman was first rate to me.",1126224000,2,379,4.507246376811594

2443127,1,B000BVM1WI,This DVD was listed as NEW and when I opened the case the disk was severly scratched up on both the top and bottom of the disk. It would not play. Given how much I paid for it I did not bother with the hassle of returning it but I was very disappointed.,1346630400,,253,3.792452830188679

2443129,3,B000BVM1WI,"I happened to catch this movie on T.V. this afternoon, and... dear lord, it is mind-bogglingly bad! I actually thought that it was some low budget after school special, or perhaps some fan-made sequel in ""The Substitute"" series. Boy, was I surprised when I found out that this was actually in the theaters when it was released!

The most ridiculous part of this movie is that the protagonist (Nick Cannon) is sent into a school as an undercover cop, to earn the trust of his classmates and unmask the crime ring that exists therein. There is slight problem with this logic, however... Nick Cannon's character is a black kid who promotes himself as being from the ghetto, and the school is made up entirely of privileged white kids! HOW could he ever earn their trust? The cops couldn't find one white kid to use as their undercover agent? This alone would make the movie hilarious, but the acting, dialogue, and ""action"" sequences are just as funny.

So why did I give this movie three stars instead of one? Because it's hilarious! The producers sought to make a crime drama/action movie, but they unintentionally ended up with a comedy. This movie is so bad... it's actually kind of good! This level of badness is a thin line, indeed... it's sort of like a low budget movie made for the SyFy Channel, in that regard.

If you can appreciate the humor in the film being so absurd, you will definitely get a kick out of it. If not, then you should avoid it at all costs.",1328918400,,1468,4.553030303030303
2443130,4,B000BVM1WI,"fast service, awesome price.  i was a little unsure if it was the right movie at first.  stars nick cannon but did not have his name listed",1237852800,,139,4.111111111111111
2443131,3,B000BVM1WI,"I disagree with most of the Amazon reviewers.  I thought this was an interesting little movie.  I disagree with most of the reviewers who say this is unwatchable and say it is trying too hard to be Beverly Hills Cop.  I didn't find Cheech Marin's character as the Captain as hard and abusive as the Beverly Hills Cop capt/inspector.  Besides, to me, Cheech Marin elevates any project he's in.  I disagree with those who say Nick Cannon was unbelieveable as a high schooler.  He was actually more believeable as a high schooler than he was a cop.  And to the reviewer who says that Cannon should have steered clear of this project and others that call for him to be a student just because of his real life age... that doesn't matter because he still looks like the high school senior he portrayed in this movie.  I wouldn't mind seeing him in this character again, perhaps not in high school, because it was a fun character.  It was a not boring movie and that is the only criterion in which I care.  I was bored senseless with Academy Award winning movies like Out of Africa and The Piano.  Take this movie for what it is and stop comparing it to others movies that it may remind you of.",1215734400,,1187,4.39908256880734
2443132,1,B000BVM1WI,"Take out everything that is appealing about the Beverly Hills Cop series and replace Eddie with Nick Cannon(who nobody finds funny) and Underclassman is what you get.

Premise: Tre Stokes(Nick Cannon) is a rookie bike cop who is assigned a case on a mysterious murder of a teen. He is instructed to go undercover as well as inducted into a high class private school to finish high school. Later on as the plot develops you find out that the head of the private school is forcing preppy teens to steal cars so he can trade for an extasy knockoff called ""bliss"".

Opinion: I can only stand Nick Cannon in one movie and that is Drumline. When he tries to be funny he falls on his face. Let me show you all the ways that this movie wants to be Beverly Hills Cop. 1. Nick Cannon's character Tre tries to be funny but Axel Foley didn't have to try to be funny because he already was funny! 2. Tre' gets himself so deep into the case that it cost him his job just like Axel Foley does. 3. Tre's boss is just as hot-headed as Axel's boss. 4. The action scenes mimic what you would see in BHC. The only difference between the two is that in Underclassman, Tre is not visiting LA he lives there and BHC had more credible villains. The villian in this movie... what a ham! He definitely wins the the ham of the year award. Some irascible dean who forces preppy punk kids to steal cars so he can trade for an exctasy wannabe? Just slap that hoe and end the story! The script sounds like it was written by some hack who got inspired by BHC and said hey, I can do something like that. Rosalyn Sanchez is gorgeous as usual but that is still not a reason to see this movie. Another thing that bothers me is that Im sick and tired of seeing these cheesy white boys trying to act black in these movies. It's not funny and it will never be funny! Give it a rest PLEASE! In closing this movie 93 minutes of dry humor and hackneyed action scenes. I'd recommend Beverly Hills Cop III(the weak link in the BHC series) over this movie. Its THAT bad.",1211068800,,2025,4.243523316062176
2443133,2,B000BVM1WI,"The only good thing about this movie is Roselyn Sanchez, she is fine and as far as Nick Cannon I can't stand him, he's not funny at all and tries too hard to be tough and I recommend not getting this movie unless you wanna see the sexy Roselyn Sanchez, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars!!",1187395200,,297,3.966666666666667
2443134,4,B000BVM1WI,"This movie isn't bad it was ok to watch but i wish Nick Cannon would stop taking rolls that put him back in high school even though he was playing an undercover cop as much as i watch i couldn't see him as an undercover cop..if he wants people to start taking him serious he can still do comedy and whatever but stay away from the high school rolls he is like 25,26 yrs old..",1154563200,,375,4.013333333333334
2443135,5,B000BVM1WI,"Wouldn't it be great if people wrote a review on the actual movie and not just the lead actor? What did you do, look at the cover, see Nick Cannon, and write your review? Because this isn't like any other Nick Cannon movie I've ever seen. I was kind of disappointed because normally his movies are more for girls than guys and this seemed more like a guy movie.

Nick Cannons CHARACTOR (not him!) is a police officer. He goes undercover at a high school campus to find out who has been stealing cars and commiting murder. It's a really funny movie and for guys there's lots of action and guns and stuff blowing up. And for girls Nick Cannon looks almost as hot playing basketball as he did banging the drums in Drumline.",1153872000,3,720,4.373134328358209
2443136,3,B000BVM1WI,"Granted that Nick Cannon is not the best actor, his charisma and sense of humor make a great addition to this comedy/action flick. The plot is good considering it's genre. It has everything a person who likes action movies wants. It has explosions, beautiful women, and sweet cars! This movie is definitely worth renting if not buying as well.",1144022400,3,343,4.830508474576271

2443139,4,B000BVM1WI,Is this film really by the director of Pretty Persuasion? Anyway - it is Nick Cannon so I figured it was a commercial film. The story is kind of generic and it seems a little disjointed but no more than these genre films normally tend to be. good mindless entertainment,1138320000,3,269,4.4
2443140,1,B000BVM1WI,"Who does this guy (Nick Cannon) know that keeps getting
him parts in films, album deals, television shows, etc.?
Either he has the greatest, most connected agent in history
or he must be incredible on the casting couch!
Now he's Mr. Mariah Carey, so I guess it doesn't matter
if his career is a bizarre joke!
At any rate, please don't waste your money!
If I could give it a half a star I would!
I normally don't post a negative write up, but this
guy has just got to go, man!---Yiiish!!",1138233600,6,486,4.293478260869565
2443141,3,B000BVM1WI,"Nick Cannon plays ""Tre"", a young detective who goes undercover at a preppy school.  His goal is to catch a stolen-car ring in it's act.

Roselyn Sanchez plays her role nicely as Karen Lopez, a teacher at the school. She stands out in the movie and is very sexy too.

Cheech Marin is convincing as Tre's boss, Captain Victor Delgado who happened to work with Tre's father, who was killed in the line of duty. Tre and Capt. Delgado eventually form a bond after many ups and downs.

Kelly Hu plays Lisa Brooks, a co-worker of Tre on the force.  They have good camraderie throughout the movie.

This movie won't be nominated for any awards, nor will any of the many actors/actresses.  But it's not as bad as many of the previous reviews have made it out to be.  Sure it's hard to believe Nick Cannon playing in the role of a detective.  Even I have to admit he isn't fit for the role.

Watch and see for yourself.",1137888000,3,909,4.325443786982248
2443142,1,B000BVM1WI,"this movie was like 10 movies rolled into One&none of it any good. Nick Cannon has some chemistry but it never has developed into much beyond what he did in ""DrumLine""(which was a decent film to me)&I like a few songs he has done over the years,but He ain't gonna ever abandon a singing Career for Movies because it ain't fully there.but this film  tries way too many things&very cliche jokes,&themes. I did Love seeing Rosalyn Sanchez. yes Lawd she was the most happening thing about this Clunker.this film runs just like Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley's Blue Chevy did in  Beverly Hills cop:slow&out of gas before it gets a chance to even get started.",1137801600,6,648,4.675438596491228
