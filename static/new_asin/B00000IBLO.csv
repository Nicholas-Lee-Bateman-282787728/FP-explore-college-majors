1219217,2,B00000IBLO,"i have to say i was pretty disappointed by this film.  afterseeing indochine, queen margot, and le libertin, this vincent perezfilm was a sleeper!  not only is the dialogue stilted and undeveloped, but the different accents kinda threw me off.  (vincent perez speaks decent spanish--but his english is tinged with a french accent while the rest of the family speaks english with a spanish accent!) the actors make a valiant attempt at salvaging the movie, but the result is a cheesy, overblown, wannabe epic.  (it's almost painful to watch mary and francisco interact.) while the scenery is gorgeous, there are other films with far better stories, character development, and dialogue.  try belle epoque (with ariadna gil and penelope cruz) or le bossu (with vincent perez) for a better representation of these actors' talents.",954979200,5,826,5.180451127819549
1219218,5,B00000IBLO,"""Talk of Angels"" is truly a beautiful, romantic and sad movie. It captures the period of the revolutionary 1930's in Spain magnificently with  breath-taking scenery. The characters are both beautiful and  inviting; you feel for them and want to know more about them. Overall the  movie was very well put together with terrific actors, a good storyline,  and the ending almost tragic. I loved it! This movie reminded me of Evita  & The Horesman on the Roof both very good movies.",930096000,14,478,4.851851851851852
1219222,5,B00000IBLO,"This is a lovely, inspiring and ultimately sad film.  It is not for the audience that has to have endless discussion and psychobabble about feelings, conflicts, etc. or action, action, action.  The story is set in Spain in the 1930's as the Fascists were gaining power and the Spanish Civil War was in the air.  Both the hero and the heroine are from a strong Catholic tradition that elevates family and adherence to the church's teachings (however flawed they may be).  The two actors involved not only have chemistry, but it is smoldering. However,  it is also quiet and restrained, as it would be in that setting and at that time.  Many things were happening that involved the family into which the young Irish tutor had come and they were monmentous events, involving the lives and wellbeing of all the members,as well as the fate of the country they love.  The father (Franco Nero) and the son(Vincent Perez) were both anti-Fascist and they were in more and more danger as the movie progressed. I found the love story to be moving and the portrayal of the torn feelings of the lovers and other family members to be sensitive and engrossing.  It was a terrible time of conflict in Spain and the young tutor had just left her homeland, Ireland, which had recently undergone a similar tragic upheaval.  I think this story is about things that mattered greatly at that time and place--conscience, patriotism, devotion and integrity.  It was beautifully filmed and acted and had a deeply moving message about the passions, needs, and duties that drive decent people in times of turbulence.",1241740800,2,1589,4.8088235294117645
1219223,3,B00000IBLO,"Beautiful story, well done. Would like to see more of the leading lady in other things. Not the ending I would have hoped for but probably more true to life.",1224460800,,157,4.266666666666667
1219224,5,B00000IBLO,I was deeply touched by this movie. It was well made and beautifully written. The casting was excellent. I think no other could have played Mary and Fransisco better that Polly Walker and Vincent Perez. You could feel the attraction between them and the chemistry was amazing. I was so moved by the story that I ordered the book that it was based on...Mary Lavelle by Kate O'Brien.,1181174400,6,381,4.617647058823529
1219225,5,B00000IBLO,"I have watched this movie several times and love it each time. However, I have showed it to some friends and none of them liked it. You really need to love history, romance, and period pieces to fully appreciate this movie.",1154649600,6,223,4.463414634146342
1219226,5,B00000IBLO,"TALK OF ANGELS is a beautifully photographed, well written, and sensitively acted story about how political upheavals alter our interpersonal relationships.  The time is 1936 and the place is Spain in the throws of Fascism and Franco.  A wealthy family (Marisa Paredes is the mother, Franco Nero the father with three daughters the eldest of whom is Penelope Cruz) in an unnamed Spanish city has just hired a governess from Ireland to teach their children proper English.  The governess, Lavelle, (Polly Walker) has taken the job to put distance between her Irish activist betrothed and herself, finding the need to explore the world before settling for what she has. In her new Spanish home Lavelle encounters other Irish expatriots who have fled Ireland's upheavals only to find those of Spain.  Among these eccentric women is one (Frances McDormand) who falls in love with Lavelle. The family for whom Lavelle works attempts to stay outside the political upheaval that fills the streets at night. All proceeds smoothly until the son Francisco (Vincent Perez) visits with his wife and family in tow.  Francisco supports the Spanish activists, and Lavelle slowly falls in love with him - the embodiment of the ideals of her own betrothed. Sides are drawn and defined in the political arena and in the personal arena, and it is the resolution of both that provides an open end to the story.
The acting is first rate with Polly Walker incandescently beautiful and delivering a character role with great sensitivity.  Vincent Perez is her perfect foil and the rest of the fine cast draw unforgettable characters. There is much to be learned here about the political milieu in Spain in the 1930s.  And there is even more to experience in the beauty of the conversations, the dancing, the vistas of Spanish landscapes.  The musical score is lush and wisely orchestrated.  This is a little sleeper of a film that deserves repeated viewings to catch all the levels of meaning.  Recommended.",1077235200,44,1984,4.984848484848484

1219228,5,B00000IBLO,"This wonderfully acted tale takes place in the mist of the Fascist's rise to power in Spain.  The movie tells the story of an Irish nanny, how she contends with her peers and the family she works for.  She falls in love with the married son of the family--but while a theme in the movie, it is not the major one.  Instead, the movie focuses in on the family dynamic and how different members of the family contend with the social and political strife around them, told through the eyes (to use a cliche) of the nanny.
Sadly, because this movie doesn't rely on nude scenes, things blowing up every five minutes are cursing every other word, few have heard of this movie.  My recommendation would be that you get a copy of this movie ASAP.",1016150400,35,737,4.397058823529412
1219229,4,B00000IBLO,"I watched this movie because I am becoming a fan of the strikingly handsome Vicent Perez. I not only tremendously enjoyed Vicent Perez in this movie but I actually enjoyed the story it told.  Being an American with an hispanic background and a history buff, I often wondered what Spain's role was in the World Wars.  This little story not only let me see a little of what my ancestors stance might have been during this period, but by the way the Spanish people where portrayed in this movie I also caught an insight on their way of life and made me proud of the scence of pride, strength, and intelligence they seemed to have possesed and passed on to future generations.  The chemistry between Vicent Perez and Polly Walker had a little to be desired though.  I am sure this could have been improved if the charactors had been able to explore each other a little more instead of trying to cram their story into 1 dance and one afternoon.  All in all the story was meaningful, enjoyable and encompusses the whole families views and emotions during these trying times.",992304000,5,1068,4.570680628272251
1219230,5,B00000IBLO,"I would not worry about Vincent Perez's accent in Talk of Angels, especially as he is part German, part Spanish, and was born in Switzerland of all places. With his sultry good looks and bedroom eyes, chemistry should be the least of your concerns. Vincent Perez is sensational in this role and above all else, this movie is so passionate that your fingers will tingle and you will weep for these lovers.",985651200,7,404,4.625
1219231,2,B00000IBLO,"Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, ""Talk of Angels"" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest.",982627200,5,547,5.2272727272727275

7909620,5,B00000IBLO,This is one of my favorite movies.  An Irish woman going to Spain to be a nanny to a family steeped in tumultous period of Spanish history which guarantees a lot of action.  It's a movie of loyalty and intrigue and characters who have to make grave decisions about their lives.  It's topped off with a love affair that decides the heroine's future.  Not a dull moment.,1455753600,,368,4.447761194029851

7909626,3,B00000IBLO,"I love this movie but cannot enjoy it b/c there are problems with the subtitles feature. 1/3 of the movie is in Spanish and there are no subtitles for the Spanish portion to show what is being said, only the English portion. I exchanged the first copy I got for another but the 2nd copy had no subtitles whatsoever. I ended up returning it for a refund. Not sure where these dvd's are from but they don't seem like originals to me. There's no way to understand the full extent of the film without the Spanish translations.",1394064000,,522,4.391752577319588
7909627,4,B00000IBLO,"Franco Nero still looks great as the owner of an estate in Spain, and Polly Walker arrives on her ""adventure"" as a governess. Instead of being brats, the children all love her in time, which is a plot change which is refreshing. She shares funny moments with other governesses, who become her good friends - and they know when she's falling in love with the son of the owner. He's beautiful Vincent Perez, and it's ""love at first sight"" - but, of course, he's married, so it's hopeless. He unrealistically asks her to run away with him, and she sees the impossibility of the situation. It's formulaic, predictable, to the point that Vincent Perez dies as always in his movies. I would enjoy seeing one he lives through. Purchased through Amazon.",1292371200,2,745,4.694656488549619
7909628,5,B00000IBLO,"the scenario is excellent, but Polly Walker steals the show, and while I have a bone to pick with French movie actors, Vincent Perez is also very good.  My only problem is I do not understand why Polly Walker did not become a better known actress, she has the looks and talent that a Julia Roberts would beg for.",1283731200,2,312,4.288135593220339
