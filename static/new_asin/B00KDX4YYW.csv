I wavered between four stars or three, because for anyone who enjoys Cantinflas' work, this film is sure to be among the favorites. Yet people who look for four-star movies also usually look for an identifiable plot, and they won't find one here. All the same, there are marvelous moments in the life of a kind man who begins as a letter-writer for the illiterate, comes to work in a bureacracy, and eventually returns to his place behind the typewriter. Along the way, he has hilarious encounters in the appraiser's office (where they want everything in triplicate, along with birth certificate, kindergarten diploma, etc.), moving encounters with a friend's deaf granddaughter, and adventurous encounters in an antique-car race. As with most of the films of this talented -- and under-appreciated -- actor, the so-called ""plot"" merely serves as background for Cantinflas' humor.
So I ended with the perfect compromise: A Spanish-language review with four stars, this English review with three stars ... and in both, a hearty recommendation of this charming movie.",1067644800,2,1105,5.213483146067416
