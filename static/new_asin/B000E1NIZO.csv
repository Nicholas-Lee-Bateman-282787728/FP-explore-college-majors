2480085,4,B000E1NIZO,"I reserved this at the library by accident. I liked her hip hop dancing dvd.
There are three levels of dancing - beginner, intermediate & advanced. There is also a video terminology where she demonstrates what a step, hook, kick, three-step, tap, ball chain, grapevine, swivel, toe or heal fan, etc. are & they are very easy movements.
Christy (on cover) teaches you alone. She's very lively/enthusiastic & speaks quickly & gets to the point quick which is refreshing. She's a little OVERLY enthusiastic, a bit corny, but better then dry/boring instructor any day.
Christy teaches you about once the moves w/o music in 1/4-1/2 speed, then again in normal speed with music (she still calls out the name of the step here). During teaching, she has her back to you, calling out the type of step as she goes. If there is turning & repeating involved, she teaches you the part up to the turn, has you practice normal speed quick w/o music, then goes on since directional changes can seem more confusing then they are.
She encourages you to rewind. I think she teaches well, going 1/2 time when teaching, back turned, calling out the name of the steps instead of just counting in 8s. I wish all dance videos did that. The only thing people could wish for is more practice, but since this is low budget (though professional sound, lighting/camera work), you gotta cut costs somewhere.",1201737600,7,1377,4.741666666666666
2480086,1,B000E1NIZO,"Very, very disappointed in it.  The music was horrible; she is a good dancer; but there should have been a brochure with it showing the different foot steps.",1200009600,4,157,4.607142857142857
2480087,1,B000E1NIZO,This a sad example of instructional tools.  She was too fast and it was not clear at all.  Would not recommend this video to anyone.  I am so sorry I wasted my money.,1193961600,3,166,3.9696969696969697
2480088,1,B000E1NIZO,"I love to dance and I pick up dances pretty well, but this video has really old line dances that are not even played in country clubs. Christy Lane also doesn't explain how to do the dances at all, so, I wouldn't recommend buying this video.",1178755200,,241,4.260869565217392
2480089,5,B000E1NIZO,"This truely is a favorite.  I love the dances and I love the way the DVD is set up to review steps easily, making the dances easy to learn.  I also have the CD to practice to, and I love it as well.  I also enjoy Chrisy Lane's enthusiastic presentation. It's a great DVD.",1168560000,3,271,3.9814814814814814
2480090,4,B000E1NIZO,"This line dancing guide is great for those that are committed to learning how to line dance AND have taken some beginner level classes before. The video moves through each dance step very quickly and begins the dance moves shortly after. For beginners, you would have to replay many many times. For intermediate dancers, the video may be a comfortable pace. I've enjoyed learning several of the intermediate level dances that are still popular in dance clubs today. It was truly an enjoyable purchase!",1141776000,16,501,4.976190476190476

8103942,2,B000E1NIZO,"The way she introduced dance steps are great, I'll give 5 stars.  Her leg...bad, not closed properly, if u are learning only steps it's ok.  If u are bigger.  Find better teacher than Christy lane.",1452556800,,197,4.571428571428571
8103943,3,B000E1NIZO,"Good dances, but not easy to learn by yourself.",1426982400,,47,4.333333333333333
8103944,5,B000E1NIZO,"If you are a quick visual learner, a teacher, or a dancer, this tape is a great addition. There is  *lot* of territory covered, and since you can re-play, nothing is repeated endlessly. Goes from beginner to advanced. Great teaching tool. It is a companion to the book and CD. The DVD does not contain the music on the CD ~ which has actual cuts. S'ok because all you want from the DVD is music without words. Buy all 3!",1376438400,,420,4.25
8103945,5,B000E1NIZO,I've never line danced always wanted to learn.  Christy's made it easy.  Her instructions are thorough and easy to follow. The music is excellent.  Without lyrics you can concentrate on what she is saying.  Two thumbs up!!!,1338595200,,223,4.945945945945946
8103946,4,B000E1NIZO,It was pretty good but couldn't figure out to go to the different dances without going back to the beginning.,1328227200,,109,4.5
8103947,5,B000E1NIZO,"I knew the"" electric slide"" and that was the extent of my line dancing skills, until I watched this. I am now such a fan! What a great video and style of dance! This video will get you up to snuff, so when you go out to the country western bars you can join in on the fun. This is a great dance style for those who are shy, because you are dancing with a group all doing the same movements so there is no fear.
I'm not a fan of most country music either; however, Christy did a wonderful job of selecting songs that are fun and easy to dance.",1243036800,3,542,3.891891891891892
8103948,5,B000E1NIZO,"This video is great.  The nature of videos is that you can pause and rewind, and Christy's organized, clear method of teaching makes this a really great video to learn.  She keeps it interesting and energetic too...you don't get bored.  This is a GREAT way to learn these dances!",1242691200,3,279,4.653061224489796
8103949,4,B000E1NIZO,"Ok, so the music is really bad but she gives great instructions on the basic steps for line dancing. I bought this when I first wanted to learn to line dance and even though several of these line dances are not done in this area, I've been able to pick up other dances because of the basics I learned from this video. Pretty Cheesy music but hey, if you really want to learn how to line dance, this is a great way to start!",1236556800,,423,4.0476190476190474
8103950,5,B000E1NIZO,"5 stars.  I loved this DVD. It has 22 dances on it unlike other DVD's!  It also had all the steps I needed to learn.  It really helped with my self confidence.

I totally recommend this video.  Christy Lane really knows her stuff!",1212019200,3,230,4.255813953488372
