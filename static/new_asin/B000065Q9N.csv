7961100,1,B000065Q9N,"This dvd is pretty bad. I've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the ""triple feature"" dvd.",1095292800,16,199,4.714285714285714
7961101,5,B000065Q9N,"Above standard triple feature DVD chock full of classic and deserving films. This review will discuss each film included on the disc, explaining the movie quality, picture quality, and audio satisfaction.

  Nosferatu: The tale of a century old, immortal vampire creature named the ""Nosferatu"". This is an undead creature that has survived since 1443 and has superhuman qualities. This film tells the experience of two innocent villagers who encounter the evil creature. Jonathan Harker and his wife Nina are living their usual lives, when Harker receives a strange business letter from a rich count that wishes to buy a house adjacent to theirs. The sequences when Harker arrives at the castle and falls into the clutches of the count are frightening even to today's standards. A memorable scene is with Harker in the count's castle bedroom. He opens the door to the mess hall, to see the count standing motionless at the fireplace, 7 feet high. Harker literally grins with fear and shrinks into his bed. Later, Harker manages to return to Bremen, just when the plague has hit. The count arrives by ship, killing the crew in his wake. The plague curse can only be broken when the dreaded and powerful vampire is destroyed.

  A classic silent film and a very entertaining one. However, note that this is NOT the restored Nosferatu included on this triple feature. Instead, we view a scratchy, 80 year old, fuzzy focused print. It is quite watchable, but inferior to the more recent Kino Video release.  The film looks and sounds its age frequently on this DVD.

  Phantom of the Opera: My very first horror classic was this 1925 masterpiece starring Lon Chaney Sr. My favorite movie of all time. The Phantom is physically a mountain, and has face is terrifying. It takes a whole mob to outwit and kill this cunning man, who is far worse than your average film villain. Countless classic moments. Note that this isn't a film for young children. The transfer here is suitable.

  Metropolis: The son of a heavy authority in a futuristic city discovers the bleak conditions of the working class, who live in the underground catacombs of the city. The young man works to fight the slavery. However, when the authority, the man's father, discovers floorplans in the uniforms of workers killed in a machinery accident, he orders his threatening accomplice, C.A. Rotwang, to construct a robot of a worker girl to cause revolts. There is a near apocalypse of the giant city when the ranks clash in a revolting fight. Also a historical classic directed by Fritz Lang.

  The title cards during the film are legible, but the print looks rather overexposed and pale. This is also the oldest DVD print available and certainly not the best. If you are picky for quality and want a superior print, buy the Kino DVD.

  This first volume of the ""Triple Feature"" Collection by Navarre Entertainment contains three classic films, and is well worth the extra money. The picture quality is from old, unrestored prints, and will displease intolerant viewers. But this DVD is recommended for carefree horror classic fans, which include me and some reviewers here on Amazon.",1092441600,8,3153,4.903954802259887
7961102,3,B000065Q9N,"All three of these movies are very good, but the image quality isn't good. I found all three movies watchable, but would definitely prefer a nicer copy. If you are willing to pay more for one movie than you would here for all three you will definitely see and appreciate the difference. These are silent movies so the audio tracks are music - not original recordings, so the sound quality is better.
Metropolis - A sheltered young man in a futuristic society comes to realize the slavery on which is society is based and works to fight it. This is a very good movie - my favorite on this disk, though I would probably have put it on one of the science fiction disks - not horror. The titles are all readable (which is import in a silent film!). The worst problem with this copy is that a large number of scenes and shots are too pale and look very overexposed. The visuals were often frustrating but I was always able to see well enough to see the important details and the story was engaging enough to keep me watching.
Nosferatu - This is the story of Dracula. They changed some of the names and I couldn't tell whether they were trying to pretend it was not Dracula. The vampire was called ""Dracula"" once in the movie that I caught. (I'm sure there's some history I could read up on if I cared enough.) I didn't find the movie all that scary but most of the original elements were there. The vampire makeup was not very mobile so the vampire seemed card-boardy. Some of the titles were cut off by the screen width which was annoying but I was still able to follow everything. Another reviewer mentioned that this version is also a bit cut up with some interesting pieces missing, which I didn't know from watching this version. If you are a serious Dracula fan I know that there are other editions available and you would probably prefer one of them. For myself, I found this sufficient.
The Phantom of the Opera - A disfigured and insane man lives in the catacombs beneath an opera house and gains a reputation as a Phantom. He falls in love with a singer and helps her reach stardom but when she falls in love with another man he kidnaps her and trys to kill everyone who gets in the way of his marrying her. I enjoyed this one a lot, though I kept expecting them to break into the music from the Broadway production. This was a very well done film at the time with some very impressive sets that feel like real spaces. This is probably the best quality video on the DVD of the three movies. Everything is visible including the falling chandelier, the titles are readable and don't get cut off. One scene is done with a red light to very interesting effect when the Phantom arrives at a masquerade ball costumed as Death. With this film I think you are losing less against a more expensive separate release.",1037059200,12,2812,4.4096153846153845
7961103,1,B000065Q9N,"I never realized people had the balls to make such abysmal tranfers of films and sell them on DVDs.
The title of Fritz Lang's film sums it up.  It's misframed, scratchy, and fuzzy focused.  You only see, ""Metropo"".  The rest is off screen.
The DVD is complete garbage.  If I could return it, I would.
What a shame considering the three films it contains are such extrodinary classics.",1034121600,63,384,4.602941176470588
7961104,2,B000065Q9N,"If you're looking for the easy way out in obtaining these magnificent silent films, I'm afraid you may be disappointed.  I bought this set because I didn't want to spend [$$$] on the remastered Nosferatu, but sometimes a bargain isn't really a bargain.
Nosferatu suffers from being a transfer of what may be the worst print in existence.  It is so poorly framed that the title cards run off the screen and you have to try and decipher what's left.  Not that the titles are anything to write home about - they are from some terrible English translation that changes the characters' names back to their Dracula counterparts'.  There are also huge chunks of the film that are absent.  Over the years, Nosferatu has been reassembled over and over, but this version even omits all but a split second of the famous negative image carriage sequence.
The other two films fare a little better, but not much.  At least Phantom includes the red scene...I was a little surprised after seeing how poorly Nosferatu was handled.
If you simply want to get some idea of what these films are like, and don't really mind a relatively poor presentation (these did have somewhat poor image quality even with the best prints), then this DVD may be for you.  This DVD was never intended as an archival copy, but more of a cheap, quick fix.  If you're really interested in cinema, then I'd look for these wonders individually.  The restored Nosferatu (watch out-there are several on the market) has two music scores and a full commentary, and is actually well worth the extra money.",1030838400,54,1558,4.719557195571956
