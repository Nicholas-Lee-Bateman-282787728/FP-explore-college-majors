8127085,5,B000FV8SB2,"The Police Story series is one of the main reasons why Jackie Chan is as famous as he is. This boxset is a great buy; uncut and digitally remastered (the best way to watch Jackie's movies). The picture and sound are great. There are zero problems with the discs and they are all region 0, meaning they'll play in any dvd player around the world. I love to show my friends these movies so they can see how action movies should be done!!!",1277683200,,436,4.265060240963855
8127086,5,B000FV8SB2,"I'm glad I was first introduced to Jackie through these films, as I'm not to big a fan of his collaborations with Hollywood. If you want to see Jackie Chan at his best, buy this set, you won't regret the purchase. Keep in mind these are 'B' grade films, you only really watch Jackie Chan movies for the absurdly dangerous stunts he peforms, he is truly willing to die for his audience. The actual DVD transfers are of a good-not great quality (considering the source material), if your DVD player has upscaling ability, you probably won't feel the urge to buy these on Blu-ray at a later date either. I like to think of these movies as ""good quality junk food"", and I mean that in the nicest possible way.",1256515200,2,705,4.430769230769231
8127087,4,B000FV8SB2,"Pros: I was VERY pleased with the video quality of this set, and the packaging is very attractive.

Cons: English subtitles don't match up that well sometimes with the audio, Not much in the way of special features.",1179964800,3,215,4.657894736842105
8127088,5,B000FV8SB2,Bought this Police Story box set and was very surpise on how awesome this set is.  Loaded with special features!  I love Police Story and this is by far the best tribute to the trilogy. New and transformered into a modern look to our eyes and DVD players.  I say...buy it!,1152230400,6,272,4.294117647058823
