8409761,2,B001AYMMDS,"A good introduction to real life violence, if you're into that sort of thing.  I bought this to study how criminals fight on the street as opposed to MMA/Boxing/Combat Sports.  For this respect it is eye opening and of relatively decent 'shock' value.  But be forewarned: more than one watching of this and you will become sick.  It is indeed shocking, disturbing, and over the top violent.  If you want to see how criminals really fight, it's worth a view.  However, you may be surprised to see how much of it starts up as stand-up boxing and evolves into brawling on the floor.  *ADULT MATERIAL WARNING* There is an abundance of soft core pornography and topless women all throughout this DVD!  Didn't expect that!",1490832000,,716,4.717741935483871
