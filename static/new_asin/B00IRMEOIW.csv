8644815,1,B00IRMEOIW,"I returned this dvd because the English subtitles were on top of the Asian subtitles, and it was very difficult to read.  I am not Korean and don't understand the language, but I love Korean movies and subtitles.  If this can be fixed, it would be great--the story is great.  Sorry for the low rating.",1398038400,2,301,4.4363636363636365
