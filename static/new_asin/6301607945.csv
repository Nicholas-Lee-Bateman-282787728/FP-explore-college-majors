7814838,2,6301607945,"Poor casting kills this thriller about a sculptor (Rick Rossovich) who is getting screwed in both senses of the word by a frighteningly needy gallery owner (an excellent Sally Kirkland) who is using him for sex and refuses to pay for any of his work she has sold.  When she is murdered by the sculptor's newest pal who is both an avid art-collector and a psychopath the sculptor becomes the primary suspect since her death frees him to sign a much more lucrative contract with someone else.

There's no nice way to say it--Rick Rossovich wasn't a good enough actor to be a lead--giving him a part with more than a dozen lines was pushing it.  He grew a beard which was meant to make him look artistic but that's pretty much the full extent of his performance--he's completely unconvincing as an artist or even as a living, breathing person.  There are no standout performances performances in the supporting cast besides Kirkland.

Tim Hunter directed some episodes of Twin Peaks around the same time he made this and his early theatrical films Tex and The River's Edge displayed a strong talent with actors.  There is no sign of that director here--it seems like Hunter might have been brought on at the last minute with little prep and no input as to the casting.  Both of the screenwriters on Paint It Black used pseudonyms so this was clearly a troubled production and there's really no good reason to sit through it.",1419638400,,1421,4.66
