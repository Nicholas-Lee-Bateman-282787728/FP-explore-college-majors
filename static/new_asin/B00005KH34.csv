1619878,5,B00005KH34,"It is difficult to get ahold of a good copy of this film - my version is a pirated copy that I got in college years ago. Why did I go out and hunt down a pirated copy? When I was about 9 years old I would fake sick to stay home from Sunday School and watch Kung Fu Theatre on Sunday mornings. I have seen countless movies, but this one stood out in my memory. So 20 years later I decided I had to have it. I bought a couple of versions, mis-named movies, movies that had the right description on the back of the case, but a different movie in the box, you name it... it was painstaking. I have seen it called Master Killer (obviously that is not this film), I have seen it called Return to the 36th Chamber, The 36th Chamber, etc.

Be careful - there is a Gordon Liu film in which he plays an abbott in the Shaolin temple, that movie sucks. Its ""Return of Master Killer"" that you want.

Here is a little background on this film. Liu starred in the awesome film Master Killer, where he plays San Te. Its a serious film, and a classic in its own right. The Return of Master Killer really has nothing to do with it. Its how the production company's rename these films that gets this all confused. In this film, a comedy, that Gordon Liu plays a con-man who tells everyone he is San Te. When he is exposed as a fraud, guilt drives him to the Shaolin Temple to learn real Kung Fu. Again, he has to con his way in.

Once in the temple he is punished, and put to work. He is not ""taught"" Kung Fu, however as the movie unfolds he learns it anyway by observing as he works... where the motions he makes while working become Kung Fu motions. NOBODY ever says it, but this movie has to be a direct source of inspiration for the Karate Kid. There are so many similarities. There are tons of other films that have come and gone that draw upon this great film for inspiration, another that comes to mind is the Jet Li movie Romeo Must Die. During this film there is a fight scene that takes place on some scaffolding where Jet Li uses zip-ties to tie up his opponents... yeah, you can see the original version of that very fight scene on the bamboo scaffolding in Return of Master Killer.

No Kung Fu afficianado should be without it.",1176768000,4,2220,4.155813953488372
1619879,3,B00005KH34,"I ordered 36th Chanmber and Return of the Master Killer. I recieved 2 movies with different covers and write ups thinking it was part one and two but they were both the same movie. nobody can tell me the difference in the title for part one and two. Other than that buy the one from this seller, real good quality vs the other with was horribly boot-legged.",1155859200,7,357,4.343283582089552
1619880,5,B00005KH34,"The more I watch Gordon Liu, the more I like him, not only for his excellent martial arts abilities, but also for his expressive acting abilities (even though constrained--or enhanced(?)--by the dubbing), which this film showcases.

Liu plays a winsome, selfish con-man who in the course of the story unwittingly masters a very unique kung-fu style and overcomes his selfishness, but who does not lose the vitality of the character he portrays (with a sort of easy-going brashness) in the process. This film genuinely made me laugh!  And that is not a frequent event for me while watching movies--even intentional comedies.  Liu vents a natural, unforced humor, that carries the story along and even cheerfully colors his fights; he's funny without, apparently, trying to be.
This is one of my all-time favorite kung-fu films for hero portrayal and development.  Top shelf, for sure!",1037750400,24,883,5.153846153846154
1619881,2,B00005KH34,"This movie has potential.  Gordon Liu, Shaw Bros., Shaolin Master Killer.  Sounds tasty right?  Rent this movie. Its mildly entertaining.  But not enough to own.  The best part of the DVD are the extra fighting sequences provided as Special Features.  There are a few money scenes, but it cant even begin to compete with other Shaw titles.  Admittedly, the fighting styles are things you have never seen before, but are really pretty lame.  (I cant get into it with out spoiling, sorry.)  The Shaolin temple is only in the movie for a brief period.  The Master Killer isn't really ""that other Master Killer.""  The plot doesn't even begin to convey any drama or passion.  Skip it.  Or rent it.  Or if you are a die hard collector and need to expand go get another one of the Deadly Venom films.  If you own all of those, get any of Toshir Mifune's samurai films (not really the same style but will be a much better investment.)  If you must get this, you've been warned, its amateur at best.",1028332800,6,990,4.508474576271187
1619882,4,B00005KH34,"This was one of first kung fu movies i saw on the old VHS system and what a movie - titled over here as "" Return to the 36th Chamber"" its a sort of sequel to the Classic movie ""The 36th chamber of shaolin"" - aka Shaolin Master Killer .
Again it stars Gordon Liu this time not replaying his role from the original movie(San te) but playing a new role as con man who comes to the aid of his oppressed dye workers who are being bullied by manchu henchman , originally hired to fool the henchman into believing he is San Te from the shaolin temple , when his bluff is called , he is severely beaten and thus vows to learn kung fu at the shaolin temple to avenge his friends . Great martial arts feature throughout this movie (as you would expect from a shaw brothers film) with a all star cast as well as the lovely Hui Ying Hung (in a non fighting role)this is a must and with the low price how can you go wrong.....",1014076800,9,913,4.021978021978022
1619883,3,B00005KH34,This movie is a little annoying. I know this is named Return of the Master killer but he's weak. If this is supposed to be part 2 of Enter the 36th chamber he must have got hit on the head and lost all of his kung fu skills & know how or something. He (...) in the first part Gets beat up repeatedly & is always trying to get back into the temple where they don't want him. He does at the end all of a sudden get his skills back & Kick some major butt though. The last 30 minutes is actually worth purchasing the movie.,1005177600,2,519,3.8598130841121496
1619884,4,B00005KH34,"Gordon Liu plays a young no good who tries to help out some of his friends from being forced out of thier jobs by manchurian thugs.  After failing he is ashamed and promises to go to shaolin and learn kung fu to fight off the Manchurians.  Attempt after attempt he tries to enter the temple, each time he is caught and sent out until finally he is excepted due to his persistance and his good will.  Liu then encounters the legendary master killer himself (played by another) Sa Fe.  After trying to trick his way through the tests and training Sa Fe forces him to surround the temple with scaffling and forbids him to touch the floors of the temple.  For a year Liu sets scaffle and looks on as the other students train, picking up bits and pieces of the styles.  Finally after completion Sa Fe tells him to take it all down and then leave the temple.  In a rage Liu storms out of the temple feeling betrayed by the Master fo the 36 Chambers.  After returning home his old friends now jobless and moneyless surround him asking hime to fight for them. All he can tell them though is that he was never taught kung fu.  But after several acts of amazing strength and ability he begins to wonder if what Sa Fe made him do wasn't actually training itself.  With his new formed honor and attitude he returns to set the manchurians straight.  This film showcases some very original and impressive styles, The Roofing style used by liu, and then the Bench style used by the master villian of the film played by the spectacular Wang Lung Wei.  Gotta see this one to.  Gordon Liu films are not ment to be missed, by anyone.",995673600,,1614,4.375838926174497
1619885,4,B00005KH34,"This movie is classic Liu Brothers! The story has nothing to do with  36 chambers of Shaolin aka Master Killer, however, Gordon Liu does visit the Shaolin Temple once again only this time he is a vagabond type that scams people for money. In an attempt to help his friends who work  company that makes material for clothing, he assumes the role of the  Shaolin Temples Monk San Te. In reality Liu's character knows no  Kung Fu and he uses tricks to make the companies slave drivers think that
He is a master. When Liu confronts the owner of the company played by Wang Lung Wei, Wang quickly defeats Liu and then makes life 20 times  Worse for his friends. Liu, feeling like he has let his friends down vows to  Learn kung fu and defeat Wang in attempts to make things better for his Suffering brothers. Liu goes to Shaolin and tries to bluff his way into the  Temple but is caught by the Shaolin priests every time. Eventually the  Real San Te see's what Liu is trying and allows him to stay at the Temple, However, Liu is only allowed to fix the scaffolding around the 36 chambers And is not taught kung fu...so it seems. Liu, while fixing up the temple watches And learns kung fu by imitating the movements of the Shaolin Monks. After many years, San Te kicks Liu out of the temple knowing Liu has learned Kung fu, but Liu thinks he has not learned a thing until he returns to his friends. Exciting kung fu follows as Liu and Wang Lung Wei get it on!! Very good transfer of the fullscreen version of the Shaw Classic, however the movie Is plagued by overblown comedy, and comedic training sequences that actually Bog down this movie until the climatic fighting in the last 30 min, but that fighting Is so off the hook!! I'd get this movie if you are a classic Shaw collector as  Gordon Liu makes every movie he is in shine, but if you aren't a avid lover Of classic martial arts movies you may not enjoy it that much.",994723200,15,1919,4.337988826815643

7943255,5,B00005KH34,"I won't go into detail about the story, but I saw it many years ago, forgot the name, and lately used the internet to figure it out and find a copy of my own.  Wow.  It was an impressive story, lots of action, good moral lesson, and just fun to watch.  The title, Master Killer and Return of Master Killer really takes away from the actual story.  I wish the title had been more realistic, like Fence Builder Becomes Hero, or The Man Who Learned Kung Fu from a Scaffold.

7943258,4,B00005KH34,"Now I never give a good review based solely on the last half of a movie, but this is an exception.  The sequel to ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" (aka ""Master Killer"") will reward patient viewers with an incredible ending.  The sequel is mostly a comedy, and does get some originality points for being so different from its predecessor.  Unfortunately the comedy itself gets some banality points, especially Hsiao Hou's ridiculous teeth.  I read some reviews of this (not just here) where it has been said that this is ""on par in every way with the original"".  That is a load of crap.  In terms of story, this doesn't even come close.  In terms of training and fights, well then we might have something to talk about.

Gordon Liu plays Chao Yen-Cheh, a con-artist.  His brother works in a dye factory whose owner recently brought in some Manchu thugs to bully the employees and give them a 20% pay cut.  The employees talk Gordon into impersonating the Shaolin monk, San Te (who he portrayed in the original film), and frightening the owners into refunding their money.  It works at first, but Manchu baddie Johnny Wang is on to their little scheme and exposes it as such.  Humiliated and angry, Gordon decides he should sneak into the Shaolin temple to train for real.  Once there, the monks also expose him as a fraud, but the real San Te takes pity on him and allows him to stay on to fix the roof, where he erects oodles of bamboo scaffolding and observes the students and monks practicing.

Recently, I reviewed ""Chinese Super Ninjas"" quite favorably, saying that the fight scenes in it were some of the most creative I had ever seen.  Yeah, well they have been usurped... a lot.  A lot a lot.  I watched with a gaping jaw at some of the stuff that Gordon Liu does in this film.  I was initially angry that he didn't play San Te in this, but when I saw the kind of dexterity he displays, I don't think it could have been duplicated by anyone else.  I've never seen him move the way he does in this flick and I've seen a TON of his films.  Amazing.

The Red Sun distributed disc is well remastered and partially widescreen, so there are no presentation complaints.  It is English dubbed and there is a selection for ""original language"", though on Red Sun discs they almost never work.  Sorry, I didn't actually try it.  The back cover actually shows pictures from the first film.  There are a few more things about the story itself that bothered me but might not bother others so I will just let them go.  Even considering that, it's still well worth checking out.  Again, the assets FAR outweigh the liabilities.  Followed by ""Disciples of the 36th Chamber"", aka ""Disciples of the Master Killer"", which is actually more of a real sequel to the first film than this one, and also a great flick.  Get all 3, baby!

7943259,4,B00005KH34,As with many Gordon Liu movies there is some comedy here.  The action is pretty good and the story is ok...just a good old fashioned kung fu movie.  It's a fun one to watch more than once.,1187827200,,188,4.054054054054054
