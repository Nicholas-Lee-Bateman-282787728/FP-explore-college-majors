8413771,1,B000BFH2LE,"I bought this 4-Disc DVD set on another website. I was happy at first because there were about 6 or 7 episodes of GANGBUSTERS that I didn't have on DVD. Plus I had no episodes of THE MEDIC period on DVD.
I watched both DVD's of GANGBUSTERS as well as THE MEDIC. The picture and sound had been digitally redone and were better than expected considering these shows were made in the early 1950's.
What aggravated me was that this DVD company edited out one of the best parts of GANGBUSTERS on all the episodes on this collection. They edited out the sequence in which the guest police officer each week would show a certain felon being wanted by the police which they called, ""A clue"".
I was VERY disappointed at this as it was one of the reasons I bought the DVD set in the first place. Also they edited out the commericals which I also was hoping would have been included. Another DVD company put out GANGBUSTERS on a 2-DVD set WITH the ""clue"" segment included.
If this part of the show being left out doesn't bother you then go ahead and get the DVD set of these really cool 1950's shows.
It's just that when I buy something I'd like the complete show, unedited.",1217376000,3,1163,4.364055299539171
