8135230,1,B000GYI3I6,Due to my Mail Man and the post office I never got it because there was never a tracking number available and my post office didn't have no information on it!!!!I really wanted to see it too because I like Trina! I really never have problems with Amazon.,1265414400,,254,4.3125
8135231,1,B000GYI3I6,"I rented ""With Friends like These"" because I thought it would be a funny urban comedy that me and by girlfriends could watch. I will try my best night to come across to harsh while I try to explain how bad this ""pilot"" was in my opinion. The acting was T-errible! The story line was L-ame!!",1215388800,,290,4.196428571428571
8135232,1,B000GYI3I6,THIS DVD WAS TERRIBLE.  IM A TRINA FAN BUT SHE CANNOT ACT.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD B/C YOUR NOT GETTING A FULL LENGTH MOVIE ON 30 MINS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY IF YOUR PLANNING ON BUYING THIS.  I WISH I HAD SAVED MINE.,1169424000,5,230,3.8297872340425534
8135233,1,B000GYI3I6,"First of all, I thought it was the whole movie and it wasnt. It was just a episode that Melvin James made into a ghetto show for 30 minutes.  Then you got DJ Khally or Khaled, (whatever he wants to be called) having a reality show with Trina.  It wasn't very good at all, the whole thing.  If I were you, I would save your money and skip this DVD.  Trina shouldn't have put this into the market, very big mistake!",1163980800,4,413,4.061728395061729
8135234,1,B000GYI3I6,"i am a huge trina fan. i have purchased all of her cds dvds and even her perfume, diamond princess. trina is so wrong for putting this dvd on the market. first off, i thought that this would be the entire season of with friends like these, but it is only a 20 minute episode. the rest is a behind the scenes look at her doing a brief interview with dj khaled and a brief look at her behind the scenes at the ozone awards. i want my money back.",1163548800,5,443,3.933333333333333
