1682133,5,B000060MVX,Great movie ! Even though its a little different from fact none the less great movis a must for all mobster fans !!,1394668800,,115,4.043478260869565
1682134,5,B000060MVX,i liked this what if story. roger corman has always been a favorite of mine. his movies have action in them and doesn't bore the audience. i believe corman also did the st valentine's day massacre another favorite of mine. martin sheen and f murray abraham also give great performances. Capone who was supposedly afraid of needles need not die from syphilis. one must also wonder if Dillinger was actually killed in front of the theater. melvin purvis never lived that one down and died in disgrace. hoover wanted Dillinger alive because he believed Dillinger had information on much of the corruption in the various police forces.,1366934400,,631,4.906542056074766
1682135,2,B000060MVX,This was not a good gangster movie.  All of the actors talents were totally wasted on this film.  This is what I call a payday movie.  Just for a paycheck.  I couldn't even finish watching it.,1365379200,,192,4.25
1682136,4,B000060MVX,It was a great movie I never thought or knew that capone asked dillinger for help on robbing a bank he asked the right guy robbing banks was dillingers number 1 hobby,1353024000,,166,4.21875
1682137,4,B000060MVX,"Although this is a totally fictional story, it is very entertaining. Martin Sheen does (as alwas) a fantastic acting job.
  The FBI gun down the wrong Dillinger, killing John Dillinger's brother. So John takes it on the lame going straight with a new life, and family.
  But Al Capone finds out about Dillinger and gets him to pull one more heist. A bank robbery where Capone has his money stashed away. Capone holds Dillinger's wife and son as hostage.
  I bought this in the bargen bin for about $5. Well worth it.",1073174400,5,516,4.554347826086956
