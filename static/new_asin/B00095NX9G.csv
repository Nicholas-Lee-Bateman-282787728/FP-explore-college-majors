2267695,5,B00095NX9G,"Ok. I wanted to write a more detailed review. But, geez, I just don't want to stop the DVD! (that should tell you something!)

WDNY just released Rachel Brice's latest piece, Serpentine. It's a 2-DVD set, divided into a drill/yoga section and a dance/choreography section. I received an advance copy as I review DVDs for several different places and cannot emphasize enough just how good this one is. I'd say it's hands down her best DVD yet as it finally has what I know I've wanted to see for so long - a comprehensive overview of her own unique signature style. The other DVDs were great (one is a historic gem that has the baseline material and moves that are the building blocks for tribal fusion; the other is a bible for tribal style arms), but both seemed to lack that unique quality of Rachely goodness - her fluid technique, nifty combos, and dance mechanics.

Well, if you want to learn her signature style, it's all here - from the yoga she uses to prepare her body to the drills for strengthening to the actual movements arranged in not one but two sample choreographies. You can read the info on exactly *what* it has (the descriptions on amazon, the back of the DVD case, etc will give you the lowdown), but I can tell you from viewing it that the quality is excellent and really well done. WDNY brings in their specialty of creating an easy to follow format, presented in several variations that will allow you to choose how you want to practice, which is a very nice touch. My favorite part? Drills of course. Overall, I'd say that the drills alone on here are excellent and fairly unique in terms of building up strength for traveling (I really enjoyed that section) and footwork as well as tribal fusion style shimmy drill. Every Rachel workshop I've attended (and I've had the pleasure of going to about 5 or so) have featured yoga and drills with a delicious focus on technique and you'll find that in this DVD.  I like to think of it as a Rachel Brice workshop in a box - an excellent DVD that follows her in-class teaching format exactly.

So the first DVD is drills and yoga. But, beyond that, there's an entire second DVD that includes two choreographies, each of which is broken down and explained, along with Rachel performing each individual choreography in full costume (don't worry there are two *additional* performances too so you can get your Rachel fix). The breakdowns assume you have knowledge of tribal fusion and basic bellydance movements - this portion of the DVD is definitely not for beginners. The combos are presented clearly, but quickly, so you will need to make sure that you know the movements as not all of the individual moves are broken down. Again, this will not be an issue if you have a good working knowledge of the dance. At times, it is pretty challenging (something along the lines of ""now you're on relevee...and traveling back with this foot pattern/arabic. and let's layer the arabic on. and then when you're comfortable with that, here are the arms and the 3/4 shimmy on the up to go with it...whew!). But often the layers are presented in pieces, so you can work with what you *can* do before adding on the extra pieces. The nice thing is that the setup facilitates you learning Rachel's more complex combinations - the combos are broken down, and there's a ""practice loop"" section for you to jam out to. One choreography offering is fast and cheeky, and one is slow and slinky, so you're really getting the best of both worlds. And, in the tradition of WDNY DVDs packing in as much material as possible, there are two smaller classes on the second DVD, a yoga for backbends (FINALLY!) and a lecture class.

Overall, a great DVD (but you probably expected that). If you're into tribal fusion style in general, this is definitely one to pick up. I know, I know - lately there have been lots of other DVDs on the market now that will give you wonderful material as far as combos and movements, but I promise you that this is THE one to own if you're looking for Rachel/the Indigo technique and dance form. And a good yoga practice for bellydancers. And some excellent drills. You get the idea ;)

You will like this DVD if:
* You would like to improve your bellydance practice by adding in yoga and drills (these will benefit dancers of any style)
* You are interested in refining and perfecting tribal fusion technique
* You are interested in improving dance footwork, leg strength, isolation, and shimmies
* You would like to learn some new tribal fusion choreographies and/or combinations
* You're a huge Rachel Brice/the Indigo fan :)

Again, DVD 1 recommended for dancers of all levels, DVD 2 for those who are intermediate or higher level",1274572800,189,4705,4.614097968936679
2267696,5,B00095NX9G,"Rachel Brice's ""Serpentine"" DVD is full of superb instruction, both in belly dance and yoga, for the beginner and any serious student who wants to have perfect technique as a basis for their movements. The yoga warm-ups and strengthening exercises add to the belly dancing by giving agility and power to areas of the body most needed in belly dancing, like a flexible, strong back, and in facilitating the isolations in the torso.

Disc 1 is all about technique. It trains your body in the basic steps, from arm movements to a tremendous shimmy drill that starts slow and builds to become a marvelous workout. These exercises build muscle tone, good posture, correct breathing, and everything you need to advance in learning the art of belly dancing. Rachel also gives you a ""menu"" of how you can best use this 2 DVD set, with a daily selection to make the most out of your practice, depending on how much time you have to give to it.

Disc 2 has 2 choreographed pieces to learn. Starting with a wonderful performance, and then breaking it down so it can be learned in sections. There is a section of ""practice loops"" which is very useful, so you can repeat each section until you know it by heart. The first piece is lively with a touch of humor, and the second piece is slow and sensual. Both are terrific and as taught by Rachel, easy to assimilate. There is a final yoga practice on Disc 2 for relaxation and to cool down which is great to do, and there are some ""Lecture Classes"" which are not to be missed!

The music is excellent and some of it unusual. It includes the Balkan brass band Brass Menazeri&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazen/dp/B000R7HS9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vranjski-San/dp/B001HEIHU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vranjski San</a>, percussion dance rhythms from Helm&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Itneen-Tribal-Dance-Tribal-Drums/dp/B0009S4IPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Itneen: Tribal Dance/Tribal Drums</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tribal-Dance-Tribal-Drums/dp/B0009S4IPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tribal Dance * Tribal Drums</a>, and the beautiful ""Whisper Hungarian in My Ear"" by The Toids.

2267699,5,B00095NX9G,"This dvd is structured more for the dancer who wants to sharpen skills and learn a free style choreography.  Not really a beginner dvd but a beginner could follow along.  She doesn't go into detail explaining breakdown of moves. So, if you are new to her style, not a bad idea to watch video first and go to other sources to learn a more precise breakdown of technique if you feel need to. I will say, She is the one who inspired me to take this journey.  I watched a video of her and was mesmerized. I too suffer from ADHD and it has been quite a challenge learning all the drills and technique.  I have had to work really hard to find concentration to coordinate movement but once I got that down, this dvd made more sense.  It is a must have. I like the warmup and cool down yoga sections. It is a workout trying to keep up with her during dance section. Especially, if you're not use to learning fast choreography. You will sweat and at moments curse.

In the different lessons, she also has a mirror around her, so you really get the idea of how to move all angles of your body to get the moves down!!! Super excited to finally have Serpentine.

2267707,5,B00095NX9G,"Excellent drills and beginning dance moves that are simple, yet challenging and for me require some practice!

I have recently started learning belly dancing with a local teacher. I bought this a month ago and I use it for practice on days that I cannot attend class. I am also able to share my experiences with my teacher who gives me further advice. I have practiced yoga almost daily for the last 11 years so I am physically able to perform the instructions. It's the sequencing where I need the practice.

Rachel Brice' sequences are really delicious despite their simplicity. I find that I love performing them at all times of the day when I get some spare minutes. Since sequencing seems to be my challenge I get to practice them and train my brain too. Besides that she is so lovely to watch!

I am just beginning to learn belly dancing so my knowledge of different dancers and styles is limited, but i have heard of some others and their styles. I would like to study those too, but for now I am content with my own teacher in town and learning as much as I can from this amazing dancer.

The yoga classes alone are worth the investment. Drills are very challenging and an excellent compliment to my dance training.

I enjoy the yoga and her extensive knowledge of the Vedic Indian system and her extensive drills for perfecting each movement.. She is professional and it shows. I enjoyed her not putting on a ""happy go lucky"" persona, it's not about her, she's just giving you the tools she learned and passing them to her students. She reminds me of a belly dancing guru.

2267738,4,B00095NX9G,"4.5 stars, so far. This DVD has been great so far. I haven't had a chance to go through the whole second DVD but from the looks of it I like what I see.

Now, I read some negative reviews on here complaining on certain things. Let me clarify for you that this might prove difficult for a beginner, even an intermediate. Don't get me wrong it has great content. But the layering and the lack of detailed explanation will leave some beginners or newly intermediate dancers baffled. About the ""robotic voice"". That's just how all the voice overs sound like, even Neon's and Irina's DVDs have a ""robotic voice over"". I mean what did you expect? They're not voice over actors! They're dancers! Lol Besides she only does a voice over in the first DVD which has the drills and on yoga sections. Which makes sense since 1. When your drilling how can you sound descent without sounding out of breath? 2. Yoga is supposed to be relaxing, her speaking is not going to set the mood, at least not for me. The second DVD she actually is speaking and is using a microphone, very similar to Neons or Jaya's instructional. There she teaches the choreography to two of her dances. Which are amazing and in it of itself challenging, but this brings me to another thing complaint.

Another complain I read about was about ""awful Mexican polka"" music. Let me clarify that it is NOT Mexican polka music, I should know, my parents heritage stems from there. It's actually Hungarian, from what I read. But regardless of that, Rachel is a tribal dancer, meaning she uses music that is not typical or cabaret nor Raqs sharqi. Her music style, dress, and dance is inspired and is very reminiscent of Early 20th century music, circus type, Romani aka gypsy music. Just google her on YouTube and you'all get an idea of what music she uses here. There's actually a video on YouTube which features this performance with the polka music.

Anyway, going back to my original point. Don't be discouraged to purchase. It's a great investment. But my advice would be to take some classes first, if not get some basic background on cabaret and then tribal. Come back when you've mastered the basics, as this will not.",1424736000,3,2179,4.596401028277635

This is more of a practice DVD for someone who has already mastered the basics of belly dance. I found it really maddening that the first DVD tells you to use a set of foot and arms patterns for which no explanation is given. I found out from reading another review that these are explained on the SECOND disc. This is not on the menu either. Also, clear instructions are not given for the layered steps so I found myself having to continually stop and replay the same section over and over to try and figure out what she was doing. A verbal explanation should have been given from the beginning. The format also makes it hard to use this DVD if you have a limited amount of time to practice and want to just pick certain sections. The menu should be broken down into smaller sections.

This set might be useful when I am more experienced in dance but for now I just found the lack of instruction frustrating. I am very confused at the raving reviews given for this disc.

2267756,1,B00095NX9G,I was hoping to use this to learn the basics of belly-dance and it promised to be easy but I got very frustrated very quickly because the instructor moves through the movements so fast that I couldn't pick it up and I've taken classes before. I tried to rewind for each move but what a pain that was. I do not recommend this video if you are new to belly-dance. This is for someone who is much more advanced than that.,1413417600,12,418,4.172839506172839
2267757,5,B00095NX9G,Very good. I love it. The exercises r good,1411257600,,42,3.7777777777777777
2267758,5,B00095NX9G,Was exactly as I hoped.,1410134400,,23,3.8
2267759,4,B00095NX9G,"I feel like there is a lot more yoga than I expected, however I think that could be a good things since yoga should help with flexibility which plays a major part in belly dance. Edit: When I finally started this video I did about 15 minutes of the yoga and lost patience. The moves are very repetitious and I've never been much for yoga anyway. I had hoped to gain something from that part, but apparently I will not be. Also, just for the dvd intro yoga it takes 36 minutes of the 2 hours. The last yoga is 25 minutes. That means for drills and techniques you only get an hour of the video. And both videos have the yoga. In other words your 4 hours turns into only 2.

It seems that the technique sessions may be somewhat short, but there are some point of interest that I haven't seen in other dvd's. Specifically how to do backbends safely and yoga to stretch correctly for it.

The shimmy exercise is this is much more extensive than I'e seen in the others I have bought, however they are not necessarily for beginners. I have danced off and on for about 10 years and I may struggle with this some since I have never done much traveling or footwork with shimmies. But where others complain I see that as a great thing. I want to grow and do more, that's why I bought this. It is just over 14 minutes, but there's quite a lot of movement to it.

The leg portion I don't see as for strengthening but you certainly see the drilling. Lots of movement and making you more comfortable with what to do with your feet and legs. It's 20 minutes long. Again, longer than most I have seen. Edit: I have actually done this part and I feel like the first strengthening part is pure junk. I jog 3 days a week so this does zero for me. The movements part is good, but I'm not used to doing actual choreography and she moves along quite a bit faster than I can catch on, especially toward the end of it. She says so much that you don't really understand and then she tosses other stuff in. I still like the section it's just going to take some work for me to get it down. After that first sequence she does kind of a squat with a shimmy that easily tires me out.

Isolation drills is 31 minutes long. Again for beginners this is beyond what they can do. Patterns for how to move are fairly easy and yet graceful and pretty. I feel like I will really enjoy this and get a good shoulder and ab workout from it. Edit: After actually doing this I feel like this work out for arms is just as good as her arms video so if you get this one don't bother buying the other one. The workouts are not the same, but they get worked alike. The thrown in foot patterns kind of throw me off for right now. I've done 25 of the 31 minutes and there aren't enough drills. What is there is good, but you do each move for about 3 min. tops and then move on to something else. She moves on too quickly.

All in all it was worth the $18 I paid for it.

I also have her Arms and Posture dvd that wears me out in 5 minutes. Which led me to buy this one as well. She is very technical without being boring about it. She informs you of what you need to know and she generally shows you a lot, whether you are at that skill level or not.

For beginners, many complain of it being too hard. I feel like a beginner can push through it. You have to understand that even though you can't go as quick or as good as her, if you continue to do it, eventually you will be.

I would say this is an intermediate or possibly advanced intermediate. There are very few instructions and you have to be used to that. I have actual intermediate videos that have much more instruction than this and much simpler moves.",1409875200,14,3663,4.113286713286714

2267764,5,B00095NX9G,"I took my time buying this dvd after having my eye on it for a while because I'm on a tight budget.  I looked over the reviews as I mulled over the purchase, especially the least favorable ones.  RB is such a great dancer, I was sort of looking for the chink in the abs, as it were, basically hoping for any excuse not to buy this product.  But I'm glad I did.

Less favorable reviews of Serpentine seem based on the expectation that a dvd can replace in-person classes.  I think people expect to somehow just *watch* a video and become better (through visual osmosis or something) rather than putting in the time to really ENJOY the ups and downs of working on technique.  This program is ideal for anyone who has made a commitment to their dance practice and wants to ""show up"" and be there for themselves on a regular basis.  I sometimes alternate this disc with videos that have a jumpier fitness/workout slant (still all strictly belly dance), but not because Brice's dvd is lacking anything.  It just means that any dancer who wants to supplement her in-person classes could benefit from having a variety of go-to videos at home.

The dvd is shot well - the demonstration of movements is clear and clean, and the camera angles show exactly what is being described in each moment.  I am only a ""high beginner,"" but I feel encouraged and empowered as I stick to the segments and gradually master them in stages.

As for the level, I have to agree with some reviewers who say it's not, strictly speaking, for absolute beginners.  But for someone with a grasp of the basics, there is a lot here.  It just needs to be gradually unpacked with some common sense.  Watching the mini-classes frequently as I slowly begin to advance is helpful - I recall one reviewer was annoyed to discover the mini-classes ""buried"" on the 2nd disc.  Fair enough, but now that you found them, just watch them!  If I had to nitpick and find any criticism of the dvd, it would be that absolute beginners and even intermediate folks might have found it helpful had there been more repeated periodic reminders in each segment as to where they might stay and drill before moving on.  There could have been something like, ""If you're a beginner, you might want to master this move first, if you're comfortable here, your next step is to add....""

p.s. - Those who found the music for the choreography to be strange just have to get out more.  The cage door is always open, people!",1404691200,13,2455,4.526077097505669

2267766,3,B00095NX9G,"Most other reviewers have said what needs to be said about this DVD set. There are two DVD's and the first starts off with 10 point check for posture, a proper breathing segment and beginning yoga. It then goes into leg strengthening drills that get progressively harder, a shimmy drill and a bunch of other things. I don't use the second DVD so I can't speak to that one.

 I am an absolute beginner, and the first time I tried this DVD set I was completely lost. I own two other DVD's (Bellydance for Beginners with Layla which is AMAZING) and Bellydance Superstars Tribal something or other with Moira, Sherri, Kami Liddle and Samantha. I bought this dvd to improve my basic dance skills since I live in a very small town that does not have any teachers. My background of dance is in ballet from my college classes. So in short, I move as a ballerina would but am trying to do bellydance.

The only sections of this DVD I use are the beginning and ending yoga sections. Everything else, I know I would need to have someone point out to me so I don't seriously injure myself. Even with a dance background, things are still challenging for me. I had to stop after using the leg strengthening drills simply because I could not keep up.

The yoga on it's own is very good, and quite relaxing. It's about fifteen, maybe twenty minutes long. Like I said, it's the only part of the DVD I use faithfully, since I want to get toned and have a strong core before I move on to the more challenging moves. While I can certainly appreciate this DVD, I won't be able to get full use out of it for quite some time, maybe not for years. That was dissapointing. If you are an intermediate or advanced dancer, this might be a good video for you. If not, I would keep looking.

I'm going to try another DVD with Rachel Brice, this one with a specific emphasis on Yoga and bellydance moves explained more in depth. I've gotten to quite enjoy the yoga part of dance (so relaxing and leaves you feeling so good afterwards) so another dvd with a strong emphasis on that with some dance moves explained would probably work very well for me.",1403481600,,2119,4.3816793893129775

2267804,5,B00095NX9G,"I would like to say first that the yoga on this 2 DVD set alone is worth it. Brice includes 3 different yoga sessions. First there is a regular yoga practice for belly dance, then she has one specifically to help you with back-bends and then she includes a cool down yoga practice so after you are done exercising you can stretch and cool off. The finishing yoga practice is included on both DVDs so whichever DVD you have been using to practice you don't have to switch disks to go to the cool-down section. Following the yoga included has really improved my sleep a lot. I'm one of those people that normally takes a while to fall to sleep every night and I sometimes suffer from insomnia. But, after a few days of yoga I started noticing that I would fall asleep at night instantly and even if I woke back up in the middle of the night I would still go back to sleep quickly. I think the deep controlled breathing that is taught has been mostly to blame because I find it easier to clear my head at night before going to sleep and just relax and let go of stress and everything that's on my mind. So I haven't had any more sleep problems since I've been doing this yoga nearly every day.

Although Brice teaches the tribal fusion style of belly dance anyone wishing to learn any type of belly dancing can benefit from this DVD. This is the first real formal training I've had in belly dance (besides training in floor work). I sat down just to watch Rachel Brice do the drills and isolations a few times and now that I understand what she is doing better I can follow along with her. I like to warm up with her isolation drills and then I move on to dance by myself remembering what I have learned. Knowing the correct posture and the different ways to isolate muscles groups allows me to create my own dance and movements and do my own thing. I don't really follow her choreography but it gives me an idea of how to start doing my own footwork and has helped me feel comfortable in dancing. Of course, I don't dance for anyone else but I love to do it as a work out at home and knowing proper technique helps me get the best results from belly dancing.

In the first section of the first DVD she quickly goes through your 10-step dance posture and in every section where she does the drills she makes sure to remind you to stand in 10-point dance posture and she makes sure to exaggerate the way you are supposed to stand that way you will get it (like taking her hands and showing you to lift the ribcage and make sure your lower belly is lifted, etc...)

I'm not a huge fan of the tribal style. I feel that most of the dancers are a little too overdressed and the set a little too gothic for my taste. But, I love the smooth movements that this style creates. Especially for those dancers who love dancing to music such as Solace knowing how to create smooth movements can help you dance to any style of music. And, of course, what Brice teaches here in this DVD can help you even if you want to dance to traditional style belly dance music or some Egyptian style drums such as Hossam Ramzy as well.

Rachel also has a small section where explains the technique to do a beautiful and safe backbend. I found that listening to her explain the technique also helped me do backbends such as the snake movements in floorwork. My backbends look MUCH better now.

Now, this DVD can work well for beginners as well as more experienced dancers but it is not your one stop place to learn all there is to know about belly dance. For more serious dancers who wish to be well rounded in all areas you will need more instruction than what this DVD alone can offer you. For instance, Brice does not explain floor work technique (although you do see her go to the floor and do a back bend in the choreography section) and she doesn't go over techniques such as belly flutters. You know, there are just some popular belly dance techniques that she doesn't go over. But, you can take the basics of what she is telling you and add onto it. For instance, she normally has you stand with you feet together hip distance apart- as is standard- for belly dance but you can still take those basic isolations and extend them to say, taking one foot forward and isolating that side of your body doing the lifts and drops. When belly dancing you shouldn't spread your feet out further than hip width apart or you won't be able to work the intended muscles properly and also it doesn't look good if your feet are too far apart (she doesn't say this, but just thought I would throw that in there but she does emphasize that feet should only be hip distance apart in part of her 10-point dance posture).

Brice teaches both upper and lower body isolations in her isolation drills section. Also, watching her shimmy drill section I have been able to learn how to follow along with both the primary and secondary beats of the drum. So, say on faster songs I can shimmy and then lift my chest or do rib-cage slides with the slower/in between beat of the music. I find myself belly dancing all over the living room and I get a good work out. Then when I'm done and have brought my heart rate back to normal I use Brice's finishing yoga practice and stretch all of the muscles used.",1365379200,8,5252,4.321501014198783
2267805,5,B00095NX9G,"As an experienced dancer, this was my first belly dancing DVD and it really inspired me to delve into this as a hobby!  I can't even tell you how many times I've done the isolation section!  It emphasized posture and form and fools you into thinking that you already are a belly dancer.  The shimmy drill is ridiculous.  It's fun just to watch, but if you're willing to practice you'll be able to get through it eventually.  The combinations are nice- they get you thinking about layering.  Though I love yoga and do this as a separate exercise session, I wish it was a little shorter for a warm-up and cooldown.  My only other complaint is that there are a couple of synching problems that last a couple seconds each- definitely not a deal-breaker, especially if you are looking at the quality of content and education as number 1.  I've owned this for three months now and this DVD has definitely helped by flexibility (especially in my back and shoulders), my overall posture and my confidence in my ability to do the basic movements of belly dance.",1364083200,,1052,4.588235294117647

I'm now practicing with Rachel's DVD, and I have to say I'm getting to know, to feel some thing about belly dancing. Thanks to the DVD and thanks a lot to Rachel Brice.

I'm a beginner, but I was willing to work through the video executing one move at a time.  If you're a beginner who loves a challenge and has patience with yourself, you'll enjoy this DVD.

Intermediate dancers will surely learn a lot and gain useful techniques for a professional polish.  I will get great mileage from this DVD and it will serve as a permanent reference as I advance in my dance skills.",1362355200,,556,4.5

2267820,5,B00095NX9G,"Rachel Brice has been a huge inspiration to me; seeing her dancing was one of the key reasons I started taking belly dance lessons.  I have been learning traditional belly dance for a few years now, and bought this to give my practice some variety and to enhance and hone my skills, as well as finally take the leap towards tribal/fusion dance.  I just tried disc one of this set last night.  It's a very long workout if you do everything on the disc-over two hours of activity!  I did it all last night because I had some free time on my hands, but most days I wouldn't have time to make a 2 hour workout the norm.  Thankfully, Rachel suggests different combinations of the drills you can do over the week to break it up and make it more doable every day.  The yoga she begins and ends with is excellent, and the drills all start out with basic, easy to do movements that gradually incorporate more layering techniques to make them more challenging.  She breaks down most of the movements step by step, though I did find one or two moves that befuddled me a tiny bit.  I found her description of the taxeem the most lacking in detail.

Rachel Brice did a great job with this lesson. Its challenging for me, It will keep me busy for a long while. I especially like her lecture on backward bending, and the yoga specific to belly dance activities. The way I see it, self care and self respect of the mind body and soul  are part of Belly dance, so yoga training is essential to this.  It may be somewhat complicated for some people, but the beauty of a DVD is you can keep watching and rewinding until you understand the techniques and character of Rachel's unique style.",1354060800,,704,4.535433070866142

I am new to belly dance and I try to do different parts of this dvd twice a week and also have a weekly class and mix up various dvds to add. I think what is good about a dvd is that you can rewind and replay certain parts. And, she also explains without taking too long and does the steps a few times before changing it or adding something else, which is helpful to know what you are practicing on and how to do it. I also recommend this dvd do to the yoga sections, which I do with the drills and instructions or on their own. She also has a lot of performances to watch. I have only taken classes a few months and am not advanced enough to do everything she does, but I got the dvd with the goal of doing them later. I do her things, plus some Tribal Fusion Fundamentals conditioning and exercises to build my balance and strength ahead of when I hopefully learn more difficult techniques.

It is assumed that the viewer has mastered the fundemtals (it's not stated. But, it's the impression I got).  This is a ""work your butt off"" DVD. You will need to pause it and practice a lot of what's on here.  Five stars to this one for the amazing amount of content, two choreos, two performances and the mini lectures are just some of what's on it.  And, I must say, Rachel Brice looks sooooooo beautiful in this that it makes me want to work and sweat to get through all the material with a big smile on my face.",1350432000,,798,4.189542483660131

If you're a beginner, this has ALOT of isolation technique work which will help to give you the fundamentals for you to learn belly dance seriously.

Rachel Brice takes it slow, shows each move step by step and then slowly speeds it up so that you can follow it and enjoy--but boy those drills left me SORE!  Which is good because it meant that I was using muscles that I hadn't used before;)  The yoga helped me to stretch out my body, particularly my back, and was a great warm up.  Takes a bit of time, but I highly recommend this to any belly dancer who wants to learn more about technique, layering moves and wants to push herself to be the best dancer that she can be;)

2267839,5,B00095NX9G,"years ago i heard someone in the SF tribal community publicly suggest rachel brice needed to ""smile"" more. like what? a hooker? i, myself, thought she just was working her own badass ""attitude"" as we all must when we dare to swagger out as ourselves.

but as a reformed performer, artist, and writer who's on a mid-life rampage through the rest of my years here, i was also wrong. i now see that rachel's taken the art of performing, being objectified, to a new level of ""i'm doing my own hot thing, and if you wanna enjoy it, fine. but this is for me first and foremost.""

and good for her for not ""smiling more."" we ought to be lucky if she merely acknowledges us at all.

the other day when i was turning a dancing friend onto her work, i accidentally found a video clip of her without her ubiquitous heavy makeup mask on, and was astounded at the sacred intensity that emanates from her soft feminine face. no wonder all the eyeliner! I GET IT! she'd be eaten alive if she went any further to make us all feel at home with her epic talents and sexuality.

and thank you for showing us all things we can never possibly do like you. but it's way more than ""smiling more"" for us when you dance like that. i'm relieved that it's on video. for that i'm grateful once again to your producers at world dance new york for such a high quality production that befits your work.

thank you again and wow. what a gift.

and you all, who cares if you ever can do ANY of this. just WITNESS her! once again it's her bringing fire from the gods that we even get to TRY.

don't get this to necessarily copy her. that's not the point. if you want another zumba workout video to make you wear out the living room carpeting, walk on by. get this DVD to witness, enjoy, and maybe even TRY to vaguely emulate what she's doing in the hopes that you'll do the rain dance and end up wherever she goes when she's doing her own thing. it's bliss. it's what we artists get strung out for. it's god, y'all. it's channelling all of time and there is no ""genre."" only what this individual did with their time here.

talk about such epic gifts.

you did way, way more than ""smile more"" miss rachel. thanks. do this life and art thing however you want. let the cabaret girls ""smile more"" and dance for the tips. you're cavorting with the gods.

smile whenever you damn well please.

and thank you.

It confused me a little because of how the video is set up . I had a hard time
finding the instructional part of the video . I have been bellydancing for two years now . Although I am not I tribal fusion dancer ;I still found this dvd very helpful. The first videos starts with yoga ; then it gets into the instructional part where it starts of easy ,but it does get more intence torwards the end ;then it goes to a shimmy drill ,and ends with yoga again . The secend video teaches the coreography then ends with yoga . I do believe that this video is good for intermediate and advanced dancers only .

2267845,5,B00095NX9G,"I like this DVD and feel that I can use within a regular practice...eventually. I have not taken a belly-dance class in my life so I do not know how to do the basics. I don't know how to properly shimmy, rib slide, hip drop, etc... This DVD is for people who know how to do all those things. Perhaps, it's me. Perhaps, I was a bit over-zealous to think that I could learn tribal fusion belly-dance without any knowledge of the belly-dance basics. I have no prior dance experience and I'm not a trained dancer in other forms at all. Maybe that plays a part in why I cannot catch on to the lessons as quickly. In my opinion, a person should have good body control and overall awareness before attempting to use this DVD. Buy it as the end goal in mind. Buy it so you have something to work towards. That's my suggestion because that is how I intend to use it.",1341360000,3,857,4.2
2267846,5,B00095NX9G,"WHAT MAKES THIS DVD SPECIAL - The learning/drilling method is new for me. Now that I have seen Irina's DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bellydance-Tribal-Fusion-Workout/dp/B00095MBQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bellydance Tribal Fusion Workout</a>), I find the method similar. The isolations are layered from the start, some of them are quite difficult, since the lower body and the upper body move in opposite directions or at different speeds. If you are a beginner you can stay with the specific isolation/shimmy that is being drilled, whereas if you are more advanced you can try to layer the steps/arms combinations to it. This can be quite challenging, since it is difficult to ignore the other movements and just stick for example to your chest circle and not move your feet; so you feel you cannot follow. But at some point you manage to stick to one movement and at some next point and without really noticing it, you will add the feet in one combination (some are quite intuitive moves, so you get into the steps gradually and at your own pace). Same applies to the choreographies, they are complete choreos as an advanced dancer would perform them, but you can leave out the hip shimmies that accompany some footwork or undulation. Your dance will not look as ""rounded"" but simple steps performed elegantly and with precision also look good. This method allows you to ""grow"" with the DVD, so you can use it for a long time period.

YOGA BONUS -I was not the yoga type, I thought it would be boring, but after doing this DVD and observing the results, I would say that only for the 1st yoga practise I would pay the price of this 2 DVD set. (Please note that I do not have any other yoga DVD to compare with). The yoga session is not fun, but somehow it is also not boring. I have workout DVD's (Gym-style with weights, etc.) and all I can think of is when they will finish. With the yoga session, although it is slow paced and repetitive I can go through it quite ok. The session is perfectly doable by anybody (nothing complicated, just alternating down dogs, planks, child poses and similar), but still the day after I did it, I felt completely different. Posture and carriage improved, my back, abs and hips felt terrific, I was energized...For one week I only did the 1st yoga practise and my dance improved significantly without even dancing, I can do the hip drops faster, my shimmy's are a bit better and without pain afterwards... The only DVD's of which I can say I noticed immediate results are:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-Burning-Fusion/dp/B000ZZT7BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat Burning Fusion</a>&nbsp;which makes you feel immediately energized and is fun to do and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Basic-3-DVD-Workout-Set-Basics-Step-By-Step-20-Minute-Workout-Accelerated-Body-Sculpting/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Basic 3 DVD Workout Set (Basics Step-By-Step/20 Minute Workout/Accelerated Body Sculpting)</a>&nbsp;of which only by doing the step-by-sep instruction- not even the real 20 minute workout- my back felt right where it should be and I slept like a baby (better than with yoga). However, the Winsor Pilates DVD is boring to such an extent that I have only done it twice, even though I really think it helps. On the other hand, this yoga session is easier to do and shorter than almost anything I have tried and it combines the benefits of the other 2 - energy + correct alignment of spine and abs support, plus it is the only one in which I also feel my hips sit in the proper place to support the upper body. Although it should not surprise me, it's ancient wisdom after all...

CARDIO CHALLENGE: From low to high, depending on the section  TONING: Medium  CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate  INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good  MUSIC: Very good  FUN FACTOR: High

CONTENT:
1ST DVD - DRILLS:
1) Yoga practise (this is a full yoga section, not a brief warm-up)
2) Leg strengthening - has a classy look: simple steps combined with elegant arm postures. In this section Rachel teaches you some footwork that will be used later in the choreographies.
3) Shoulders/Ribs/hips isolations - drilled at different tempos (1/4, 2/4, 8/4 and 16/4 notes, this latter on releve). In the ribcage section you start layering these on top of four different travel steps.
4) Shimmy session - Best shimmy layering section in my collection. It definitely increases your heart rate (cardio element) and it is fun to do. In this section be prepared for a lot of layering, since here you practise everything you have learned before (arm trajectories, shoulders, ribcage, mayas, etc.), but layered on top of your shimmies, travel steps and turns (quite challenging).
5) Yoga cool down (this is a full yoga section, not a brief cool down)

2ND DVD - CHOREOGRAPHIES:
1) Yoga for backbending
2) 2 Choreographies (step by step break down/Practise loops/Full Choreography) - Nice choreographies explained in detail in the step-by-step section, drilled extensively in the loops section, where each segment is repeated indefinitely until you manually stop it. You can also play the full choreography non-stop. The choreographies consist in four combinations each containing four 8-counts. This is almost as long as other choreographies, only these seem more difficult, because everything is completely layered on top of travelling shimmies and many are also on relevee. Even though it has no popping and ticking the layering is difficult.
3) 5 Mini-lessons (Arm movement, Steps, Technique for backbending, rythm, yoga breathing) - of these, the technique for backbending and the rythm lessons are the best, the others are nothing special.
4) Yoga cool down (exactly the same as the one in disc 1)
5) 2 performances

MUSIC: Very good choice
1st DVD, mainly drums to mark the beat for the isolations (excellent decision to my opinion)
2nd DVD one slow and one fast tempo, for each choreography (nice pieces, I specially like the fast one)

EMPHASIS:
Good overall emphasis, you have simply everything in this DVD-set.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
Shimmies, drills, music selection, nice choreographies, yoga sections, arm embellishments - I specially like the tribal style signature arms and hips (almost everything is excellent).
With this specific DVD I will rather put the very few things I would have liked different:
1) One of the yoga sessions should be smaller, so as to really use it as a warm-up/cool down, the space in the second DVD dedicated to repeat the yoga cool down from disc 1 could have been used for 2 smaller independent sessions.

2267847,5,B00095NX9G,"An absolutely fantastic pair of DVDs that holds your hand throughout your entire learning experience. Rachel does an excellent job, I was and still am truly impressed by how thorough her lessons are.

Only a few things I would like to note:

Prior dance experience, especially ballet, is very helpful. I realized while learning the various dance moves that if I had not had several years of ballet under my belt, I would have had a good deal of trouble learning the moves and putting them all together without getting all tied up and frustrated. It is important to remain relaxed, shoulders down, hips loose, and comfortably graceful.

Also, Rachel occasionally gets her rights and lefts mixed up, or her ""inhale"" and ""exhale"" commands backwards. Not a big deal, but at the times I've found this to be confusing, I've just followed her example rather than listen to what she says.

And lastly, when the yoga starts to get easy after consistent practice, it is good to modify the various yoga poses that she teaches. However, she doesn't tell her viewers exactly how to modify them, so I had to experiment a little on my own, being careful not to hurt myself. Again, not a big deal, more nitpicky than anything else.

Overall, a wonderful, wonderful experience. I absolutely love Rachel, and hope to see her one day in person!",1340582400,2,1325,4.743478260869566
2267848,5,B00095NX9G,The video contains moves I have yet to learn in my journey in dancing.  Her voice is pleasant and gives a unique reflection on learning that isn't found elsewhere.

I'm pretty new to belly dance, I've been taking classes for a few months and did sporadically for a few years before that, but I've never performed or anything like that. There is SO MUCH material on this DVD, it will easily take several more months before I can even use all of it on a regular basis. So far, I've mainly used the yoga parts since I take belly dance classes 3 days a week already. The yoga on this DVD is challenging, but I'm noticing a ton of improvement in my flexibility already. I work out a lot, and I love to do one of Rachel's yoga routines before I go to bed to help keep myself from getting to stiff from the weight machines and body weight strength training I do. It's been a major lifesaver in that regard. I love the drills as well, and I use them religiously when I travel or can't attend my classes for any reason. I haven't gone through the choreography parts yet, but I can tell from watching them that they will be very useful for practice as well.

It is an excellent supplement to in class work.

2267857,3,B00095NX9G,"So let me first tell you my dance level which definitely affects whether you buy this DVD or not.  I would describe myself as an advanced beginner.  I took one year of formal classes then moved to a smaller town that didn't offer classes but had a troupe I could join and could pick up tips from more advanced dancers.  For example, yes I know what a maya is but nope still can't control my belly undulation very well.

So if you find yourself at my level as an advanced beginner I would say just wait until you get a bit further along in your dance before you buy this DVD.  It's just a little bit beyond my level if I am perfectly honest with myself.  On the otherhand maybe if I practice it more (without getting frustrated) I will get better....hard to say as I've just had the DVD for two weeks.

Also on another note I do practice yoga and did not love her yoga instruction.  I think she is an AWESOME belly dancer and should stick to that instead of aspiring to be a yogini.  If you want a yoga dvd sara ivanhoe makes a great beginner one or if you are more advance Shiva Rea is amazing.

So there you go - that's my two cents = )",1325894400,59,1137,4.081081081081081
2267858,5,B00095NX9G,"Rachel Brice's style is one that I try to emulate - slow, slinky, and serpentine. I'm so glad that she released a DVD set that teaches her own personal style so well.

This DVD comes with a lot of yoga, as usual for Rachel Brice. If you're not interested in yoga at all, this dvd is not for you. It includes a 33-minute yoga work out, a yoga work out for backbends (yes, backbends!), and some finishing yoga work-outs. I've been trying to improve my posture, flexibility, and stamina in belly-dance, and doing the yoga work-outs before my belly-dance practice has been proving to be very useful for me. I pop in one of these DVDs every day to do one of the yoga work outs, then I do a few of the drills or work on one of the choreography sections, then I do a finishing yoga work out. It takes a lot of time if you're not used to practicing at least an hour every day, but it's been so worth it.

Even though I've been dancing for a few years I still had difficulty keeping up with a few parts. In some parts it's very easy to follow Rachel Brice and she explains things very well, then every now and then she'll pop out with one of her crazy Rachel Brice moves with not enough explanation, and you're not sure how to keep up. But overall it was very easy to follow and well explained - still working on that shimmy drill, though!

I'm also very grateful she included yoga for backbends as well as explanations and safety information (go to the mini-class section before you try the backbends, and do the yoga!)  I know some people just want to try and emulate Rachel Brice's crazy wonderful backbends, but it does take a LOT of practice. The yoga and explanations has helped me improve my backbend, though.

I also appreciate the occasional small moments of humor Rachel Brice includes in the DVD. Her last dvds seemed a little more serious, which I don't mind, but the random bits of humor are appreciated.

Overall, my favorite DVD ever! I use these dvds every day for my practice and have gotten a lot of good work out from them. I would recommend these dvds only if you're very serious about combining yoga with your belly-dance work out, and if you're interested in Rachel Brice's signature style.",1325030400,4,2203,4.400491400491401

2267860,5,B00095NX9G,"I am entirely new to belly dance, but this is explained in such a way that I completely understand it.  It also leaves room for me to improve my moves.  There are many things I can't do yet, but I feel confident that with practice I'll get there.  This DVD doesn't leave me feeling like I have to be there right now or I shouldn't be dancing.  It is enjoyable, fun, and challenging!",1319587200,,382,4.191780821917808
2267861,4,B00095NX9G,"Although I admire Rachel Brice and her ability, I'm not a hardcore fan, I've never taken an ATS/tribal class and am not planning on it at the moment. I do like aspects of her dancing though, and thought it could make me a better dancer. Ultimately I decided to buy the DVD based on the emphasis on yoga and that, at two discs for under 30, it's a steal.

Serpentine is indeed packed with info, it'll take me ages to get through it all. It's definitely not for absolute beginners, basic bellydance moves are not explained thoroughly, but if you're motivated, a quick study or have already taken some sort of bellydance class, you'll be fine.

I love the yoga sections and use them when I feel too lazy to do my regular ashtanga practice.

What I dislike: the discs don't tell you how long each section is and it's organized a bit poorly - the backbending, breathing, and arm and leg pattern mini-lessons should be at the beginning of the first disc, not the end of the second.

For someone like myself who's been learning more traditional styles of BD, this DVD also gives a peek into the world of ATS/Tribal.

I would certainly recommend this to any motivated dancer who wishes to improve and clean up his or her technique and develop strength.",1318982400,3,1244,4.511111111111111
2267862,5,B00095NX9G,"This DVD set is 2 disks, and it's so loaded with information that it's REALLY worth the price! The quality is good, it's very professional, and you also get to see very clean, lovely, well done performances by Rachel.

You actually get the equivalent of 2 yoga classes, which pays for its self, since yoga classes add up.

You get a number of drills, plus you get instructed with choreography classes.

The usefulness of just 1, or the other, disk is a good value, because you can use, mix, and practice lessons for years.

Plus, she also gives lectures, pointers, and teaches a number of things. And, she's already thought out how to use the material and lessons to make the most of it.

This is THE best DVD set Rachel Brice has ever done. It's not difficult to understand, it's challenging, it's VERY professional, is of high quality, and is very thought out and thorough.

She makes the lessons easy to understand, easy to follow, but there are also many VERY challenging parts, and very hard parts, that it give the viewer an incentive to WANT to eventually reach that difficult challenge in the future, and work for it. She's also very aware as a teacher that some parts have this difficulty to them so she will urge the viewer to just keep trying, because it's the only way to eventually get it. Even when you find a difficult part, she will never discourage you, but encourage you.",1317686400,3,1389,4.5582329317269075

I wanted a Belly Dance DVD where the instructor was a bit more believable than a lot of the others, and I found all that I was looking for in Serpentine!  This is the perfect addition.  With this DVD you can pick and choose which segments you want for your workouts, or for your belly dance learning experience.

I love that there are 2 DVDs:

DVD #1: Focuses on yoga strength training for belly dance,isolation & shimmy drills.

DVD #2: You get to see choreography, then the demo, then the choreography is broken up into loops so that you can practice a part over and over again.

I was treated by a fantastic doctor who manipulated my spine, legs, and arms.  Rachel Brice's DVD, especially the yoga sections, was also *extremely* helpful as physical therapy.  Yes, I checked with my doctor.) It was slow, gentle and attainable.  Having done ATS and a little Tribal Fusion bellydance in the past, I also enjoyed the other exercises.  Ms. Brice as an excellent instructor; Thank you, Rachel, for helping to straighten my spine!",1317168000,4,649,4.91743119266055

I love the choreographies and the way she teaches makes it sooo easy to pick them up even though I would consider the moves pretty advanced.  The production was perfect as were all the views and the voice over.  It's something you can watch time and time again and not get irritated with it.

Although some dislike the music, I kind of appreciate that it's not your typical bellydance music and I for one liked it.  The yoga to me was a little excess but part of the reason I purchased this one in particular was because I wanted to know what positions will help me increase my flexibility.  I learned that with this DVD, though after going through the yoga once or twice, I picked out what I felt was a benefit and now take it at my own pace.  Little patience for full-on yoga I guess.

There is also a section for drills which is really great as well.  Overall if you love Rachel Brice (and can you not??) and want to dance more like her, you have to get this one.  You won't be disappointed.  Ok, there is one drawback...now I want to relocate to Oregon so I can take her actual classes!",1316563200,2,1168,4.211711711711712

2267867,4,B00095NX9G,I realized I'm a way too rusty on my yoga to follow any of the warm-ups. She moves kind of fast. I feel it would be best to work with the DVD off so you can follow your own pace with the yoga movements. Flexibility is needed to gain the most out of this DVD.Once you get the breathing down you should be fine. The rest of the instruction is pretty easy to follow. I'm super psyched for the outcome.,1314748800,2,398,3.9875
2267868,5,B00095NX9G,"I was told that Rachel Brice is the forerunner of Tribal Belly Dance and I can see why. She is excellent and her cues are perfect. I would argue however that a lot of the footwork is for those who are either 1) VERY good with dance and 2) have experience in this form of dancing. I am not all that rhythmically inclined which certainly begs the question of why I continue to do these work outs but the fact is they are FUN and they do work. Brice does an excellent job with direction and shows you different angles so that you can see what the body does when you do the move properly. It helps someone like myself who likely looks more like someone having a seizure than sexily dancing about. ;) I found that I was better able to envision the move and do it properly, faster, because of her extra attention to the angles and direction.
Brice is definitely one of the best to go with regards to dancing be it to learn from or watch so I give this video 5 stars but it is something that DEFINITELY takes time to master.",1314057600,,1017,4.16751269035533
2267869,5,B00095NX9G,"I am 61 years old and needed to move and lose weight for health reasons.  I joined a dance for fitness/low impact aerobic class.  Meh--it was all right but not exciting.  Then I tried yoga.  Didn't find my zen place.  Then I tried cabaret style bellydancing.  I loved it--the instructor was amazing and made classes fun as well as a good workout.  I incorporated bellydance into my lifestyle, lost weight, got into shape, and am hooked on bellydancing. One of the other instructors begged me to try tribal.  I was in love with the control and movements--if I could just get my body to do that. She suggested I look at anything by Rachel Brice.  I saw Rachel's recommended list on Amazon and bought two of her DVD's--this one and Bellydance Arms and Posture.  Since I have sciatica, the movements keep me moving and off a lot of pain killers.

The yoga workouts with the dancing are step by step and easy to follow.  Rachel's voice-over constantly reminds viewers that if they cannot perform a movement, it's all right.  Do what you can.  I like that approach since I am not in the shape she is in and some days, I can barely move.  Do I look like Rachel when I dance with her?  Absolutely not!!  But I can pretend  :)

This DVD has inspired me to come up with an elderly/wheelchair version of bellydance as a community education class.  I could also teach this in a nursing home setting.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who not only loves tribal, but needs/wants to move and get fit.  While I may never dance like Rachel, I am able to do a lot of the movements and keep in shape.  BTW--the instructor and 30-somethings in the class are in awe of my flexibility.  That tells me something  :)",1313798400,11,1697,4.431818181818182
2267870,2,B00095NX9G,"I was very disappointed by this video. I had high hopes because it had so many great reviews, but I didn't enjoy either disk. There were several things that I didn't like. One, it feels like being instructed by a robot. During the entire first disk, the instructor is completely silent while voice-over instruction is played, and that instruction is very mechanical and not very personal or adapted to the particular exercise: i.e. same phrases over and over. This is probably my number one complaint: the instruction is cold, especially in the first disk. Second, she uses a lot of terminology that she doesn't explain (i.e. second foot pattern, second arm position, etc). It turns out that these phrases are explained at the very end of the second disk in their own section. Third, the music is seriously heinous, especially the first routine on the second disk. Another reviewer mentioned ""polka."" That is EXACTLY what it sounded like. I don't know about you, but the sound of the tuba does not make me feel like dancing. Fourth, I was under the impression that this dvd set focused primarily on technique, but I did not feel that it contained very good technique instruction. The voice over might say, ""now undulate"" or ""now do a ribcage figure 8."" But the dvd offers very little advice for perfecting those moves. It offers a lot of opportunities to practice different moves in the drills section, but if you don't already know how to do these moves correctly, you won't be taught how to do them. This is especially the case in the shimmy drill section because she stops giving instruction half way through. Fifth, I had trouble with the fact that the different moves aren't really explained: she just throws out the name of it, or the name she uses for it, and tells you to do it. I learned several of the moves under different names, so it took me a second to catch onto what she meant. Sixth, there are only two routines. I was hoping for either more routines, or instruction on how to recombine patterns into different choreography. Seventh, the overall feel of the dvd set is not very...fun. To me, dancing should be fun. You should be in a great mood when you're finished and feel awesome, not be annoyed by the music or feel hammered and frustrated by the drills.

On the positive side, her technique really is amazing and she is a great dancer. I think the drills will be good practice, and I think that the yoga sections and the strengthening sections really do help strengthen and tone the belly dancing muscles. I have been doing belly dancing for a while, so I think I'll still be able to get some use out of the drills section. But I would not advise beginners to get this video.",1313452800,42,2697,4.607068607068607
2267871,5,B00095NX9G,"I'd say this is the best bellydance instructional video I've seen. I have always been one for drills, and this has 'em. The instructions are clear and concise, and charmingly given with little smiles and encouraging dialogue.

Not only is La Brice a fabulous dancer, but she's an excellent teacher.",1313366400,,298,4.96
2267872,3,B00095NX9G,"dont let the missing star fool you.. i love this video. the yoga work out alone was worth the purchase. the dance instruction is good.. but not great for a beginner.  some of the steps you have to watch closely because she does them so smooth and elegantly you cant really be sure what youve just seen. after a few tries though you can get the hang of it (a mirror is helpful) and its a good feeling work out that leaves you feeling light and relaxed.
I haven't tried the choreographed video yet so this is based only on the dance techniques video.

I wanted to update my review as I have gotten more into the different drills. They are not all for beginners. I feel that the instruction in the yoga section is good and the legs section is also fairly good (until the last bit of the work out) However in the shimmy section suddenly the instruction dies off.. she will just give you a VERY general instruction like start with a big shimmy. she never shows how to do the shimmy. it is easy enough to figure out the basic step but the further you get into this exercise the more complex and difficult it is, she doesn't slow down and show you how to do any of it.

Again. Updating. i finally watched the second disc. the Yoga portion is good.. the rest of the disc is worthless to me. HOWEVER! the first disc was worth the money spent, so i don't really feel robbed of anything.",1312675200,4,1376,4.244274809160306
2267873,4,B00095NX9G,"I have been using this DVD for about a year and I appreciate it now more than i did to start with. I have 4-5 years belly dance experience.

The best of this DVD set is that it contains several sections (15-30 min each) that you can combine and include in your own practice, so it is very flexible to use according to your needs. Each section is at the right pace to be followed like if you were at a dance class, with the right number of  repetitions so you get the movement without getting bored.

 The first DVD is technique. It is similar to a classical tribal-fusion dance class. It is very good practice: you can feel the muscles work at the end, the coordination is tricky at first but gets better after practicing a while.  It includes most of the basic isolation moves, without  much explanation. To each movement with the body there is a routine with different steps associated, which is a good idea. Most of the yoga training is similar to the basic stretching that a dancer would do. I did not find it  improved my backband.

The second DVD are two choreographies. Yes, the music is kind of weird like many people pointed out- however, it is tribal fusion, AND, most of the combos can be easily adapted to other music- they are not that specific to the music piece. They are full Rachel's style and can add different combinations of ondulations and isolations-shimmies to any dancer's repertoire. Especially, the footwork and some details in posture to obtain the final effect are made clear.

All this said, Rachel's technique is definitely great, and, if this DVD has had so many good reviews, probably it is worth to try it. It will give you new ideas and combinations, and each of the sections is  a good workout by itself.",1311724800,2,1739,4.509554140127388

I nearly always open and close my workouts with her yoga sessions even if I don't do her drills and switch to another BD disc.  The instructor is pleasant and the moves are clearly explained for beginners.  I do my best to keep up with this fun yet challenging workout.

HOWEVER, whether you like tribal fusion or not you can get a lot out of this DVD. There is a ridiculous amount of content here for the price. The yoga sections- one for strengthening and preparing the body (particularly the spine) for belly dance, one for backbending, and a closing sequence- are excellent. I have done Ashtanga and Hatha yoga before and her adaptations of asanas are really interesting and unique (to me). Rachel's instruction is very clear and concise, and I find her voice very soothing (a major plus for yoga!). I really like how they taped her and then had her voiceover her instructions- I have not found that very often in bellydance dvds. The technique sections are great, as are the practice loops in the choreography sections. I agree about the music being somewhat different, but hey, to each her own. I will continue to use this DVD, especially the yoga sections, every week. Bellydancing can be hard on your body, and it is so vitally important to make sure that our abdominals, arms, shoulders, knees, and back are strong and flexible enough to support the kinds of moves we are doing. The yoga sessions DVD really address this important aspect of practice. I'm so grateful to have found this DVD!",1307059200,,1378,4.651639344262295
2267887,5,B00095NX9G,Rachel Brice is the eminence of tribal so its no surprise that this video is a great resource when learning the tribal style. It is a major plus that she offers a workout to condition and help stretch the body and that the video is filmed in a studio and of great visual quality unlike many instructional videos out there. I think this is a great video for anyone that wants to belly dance not just Tribal.,1306454400,,406,4.285714285714286
2267888,5,B00095NX9G,"I do very few reviews on amazon but had to get my feelings re this dvd out there. I'm 39 and never danced in my life until about a year ago when I discovered the joys of belly dance. I've practised yoga for years and had heard mention in a magazine article that the drills that belly dancers practice would be great for yoga practice, now I was sceptical I will admit but I decided to give it a go, also I seem to fit snugly into the long line of women out there who are curvy and who are made increasingly aware that 'curvy' is not acceptable for a womans body type in this media driven world(at least according to all the magazines out there!!)I discovered that belly dance drills were great for learning to isolate but I also had an amazing experience, I actually found myself loving my curves!!! and began to experience my body in a completely different way, so I continued to buy a few more dvds and also purchased Serpentine.  This dvd is spectacular and difficult and challenging but amazing and I'm so proud that I can do most of it!! and get a great work out!! So whether you have dance experience or not I suggest you buy this dvd, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!",1306022400,,1162,4.281818181818182

But searching for something a little more advanced, I got this. WOW! There is so much material on here. I love all the specific dance moves she teaches. I just rewind and go over and over until I have a move mastered. Very easy to follow, challenging and fun. I have done yoga alot too, and the yoga in this dvd is challenging but doable, I feel GREAT afterwards. I just had my second child and still carrying the baby pooch and feel like I've lost my stomach muscles, but I can actually feel and see them coming back, praise the Lord, with the help of this dvd.

Some of the dance terminology was foreign, but I did not have a hard time figuring out what she meant.  I am not a dancer, but I love to dance.  I was a little out of shape, but after doing the yoga and leg strengthening drill, my legs feel so much stronger--there is even visible muscle definition after only a few times doing the drill.  My back is stronger and my dance technique has gotten smoother.  The yoga is kind of difficult as I've never really practiced any yoga poses.  The leg drill definitely got me sweating. If I had a complaint, it would be the music that her routines are to set to.  Didn't match her style and sounded more ""carnival dancer"" than ""senuous serpentine.""

I have since come to appreciate that the technique she offered was more than worth the cost.  However, this DVD is beyond all my hopes for it. Ms. Brice has generously given us a wonderful gift of her outstanding teaching for an incredibly low price. I am wondering if this is her way of showing her appreciation to her fans. I have more than 30 belly dancing DVD's and use many of them often. But, since purchasing this DVD about a month ago... it is the only one I use.

All the movements and drills she shows here positively impacts all my dancing, as was the case with her other videos.  I liked this one in particular because it can be used in so many ways.  I LOVED the music, and I fell in love with ""Whisper Hungarian in my Ear"" that is used on this DVD.  Rachel does a beautiful dance performance to it.

One previous reviewer was spot-on...the music was AWFUL.  I couldn't decide if it sounded more like polka music or a mariachi band.  My husband walked in the room and asked me if I was listening to a mexican tuba or something.  It was THAT bad.  It's funny, because during the choreography demo sections, after each combo she puts it to music, and the first two times she does it, she does it to actual GOOD belly dance music.  Why can't the entire routine be to the good stuff?  Who knows.  The first routine (the evil mexican polka) is also quite complicated to learn.  I was really looking for some great choreography and probably could have done well with this, but I just can't get past the music enough to learn the routine itself.  Seriously.

I think it is a very good example of Rachel Brice's style of bellydance, and even if you enjoy more traditional and less fusion styles, the movements and control of body she teaches can be used for any style of dance. There is a slower and a faster dance, and there are live performances of each dance available on the dvd. She breaks down the movements and shows you how to put them all together. It isn't a dvd for a beginner, but if you have the basics down, it is a very nice dvd to have in your collection.",1295740800,,584,4.086956521739131

It's a great value for the price.  The instruction is very well done, Rachel does a great job of explaining the moves, reviewing posture and reminding you not to put too much pressure on yourself.  There really is everything, a lot of really great yoga, a fun strengthening warm up, comprehensive technique drills, yoga for back bending and fast and slow choreography.  I love that her isolations are taught over foot patterns instead of stationary and that she encourages you to work up to arm patterns.  Through out the dvd there are opportunities for layering.  This is a dvd that will be very hard to outgrow skills wise, and even if you get to a point as a dancer where the moves are all easy you can use the dvds to keep up your flexibility and technique.

My only very very very small dislike, that didn't even cost the dvd a star, was that I wish there was more flowing of movements.  I loved the way I got to move in the warm up and wished there could have been a bit of cue and dance portion where you got to dance the moves without doing choreography.  That's just a personal like of mine and probably comes from taking a few ATS classes.

All this to say that Rachel Brice has given us all a very great set to learn from and train with.",1290816000,4,1403,4.300380228136882

The first DVD is quite long and you soooo get your money's worth. Then the second DVD she teaches you choreography for one of her dances and then breaks it down piece by piece. She is incredibly clear and percise. You learn lots of vocabulary. She is a true master of belly dancing. This was a gift from my mom and sister for my birthday and I LOVE IT!

2267915,5,B00095NX9G,"This dvd is so full of technique, drill, classes, choreography, and yoga, that it seems impossible to me that it should be sold for so little.
I think my favorite thing about Serpentine is that (other than that it's Rachel Brice teaching it) it's designed to be able to be used in many ways. If you have time every day (or even once or twice a week) you could get through the whole 200 and something minutes of it, but since it isn't likely that you have that kind of time, it's been set up so that you can set up a weekly routine (such as mine where I will, every day, do the yoga warm up, and some days do the Leg Strengthening Drills, and other days I will do the Isolation Drills) and build on it each week or so.

On the downside, I find myself often having to pause because Rachel just breezes through things and I (being only a year or so into belly dance) have a hard time keeping up. I often rewind so that I can watch and re-watch how she's moving. She does give good direction, but often the technique or drill in question isn't repeated enough to hammer it home in my head.

Otherwise, I love it. I think I'll be dancing with it everyday. I won't give a long review here on everything this contains, since others have already done so, but I will say it is worth it. World Dance New York really know what they are doing.",1284940800,,1331,4.155038759689923
2267916,5,B00095NX9G,"I've been practicing belly dance for a couple of years, and I still found this dvd useful. The first dvd starts with about a half hour yoga routine - mostly good for strengthening and opening the parts of the body you use most in belly dance. It's a little boring, but if you're at all serious about dancing, it's probably a good thing to do. What I like about the first dvd is the drills are actually useful. She has leg strengthening drills, shoulders, upper abs and lower abs, then shimmy drills. It's not the most fun ever, but again - useful if you're serious about dancing. It's particularly good practice for traveling while doing upper body movements and for level changes while dancing. She also includes some practice with different types of body rolls that could help with anyone who struggles with belly rolls, or differentiating different types of camel. It's hard to get that kind of practice in a classroom or workshop setting. It ends with a cool-down yoga practice.

The second dvd teachers two routines that cover all the material you've drilled. It also includes a yoga section to prepare your back for back-bending. There is a lot of yoga and a lot of drills in this set, but it's all stuff you should be able to do if you want to dance well and for a long time.

Warning - this dvd is LONG. Don't expect to do it all in one sitting, especially not every day. The nice thing is she gives you a recommended schedule for when to practice each section.",1284249600,,1469,4.49812734082397

I only labeled it a 4 star because I can't stand one of the choreography music choices that sounds like a big-top circus. It's all personal taste of course, I had no fun learning it. I am glad however she chooses a fast tempo song and a slow tempo song so you can be snakey like she.

I still think this is a DVD worth purchasing for the educational value and love of RB.

I love that she adds mini classes which include how to time music aka music theory, and yoga for back bends. Everything else has been said by previous reviewees as to contents. Thank you, Rachel!",1283731200,8,706,4.285714285714286

If you like Rachel's style, and who doesn't, this DVD will certainly teach you how to achieve it. She narrates as well a giving a couple of little lectures. I think a beginner could use this product but having a little BD background would be better. I plan to use this regularly through out the winter months instead of hibernating in front of TV.

2267919,5,B00095NX9G,"My belly dance style is pretty much Egyptian Cabaret. I have only taken about a two dozen classes in Tribal Style belly dance. I watched Serpentine with my dance teacher Alnisa Robin Wood. We thoroughly enjoyed it. From a safety stand point, she gives a wonderful posture and warm up section with tutorials on bending backwards as well as a few other movement jewels. This DVD is mandatory for anyone who wants to add a special 'something' to their dance without getting hurt. For the money it's so economical. Her mini classes allow the student to not become overwhelmed and she even gives you a workout plan if you are a person who doesn't have much time or a workout plan if you have plenty of time. Isolations are not always easy but she makes the isolation drills doable as she reminds you that with practice, you will achieve your goal along with doable helpful hints. Every choreography is broken down into sections so that the student doesn't feel overwhelmed and can learn at their own pace. Her arms are beautiful and your arms will be also. Even though I dance cabaret, I know I will be incorporating some of her arm and turn movements into my dance. Her leg strengthening section is helping me after two knee surgeries and a major spine surgery. I love that safety is a PRIORITY and she gives you a point by point posture check. And then...a beautiful inspiring performance as only Rachael can do!...Beautiful costumes!...Like I said, I have prefered to express myself with Egyptian Cabaret and have only taken two dozen Tribal Style classes, but I will benefit from this DVD!..and I didn't even mention her yoga and body strengthening sessions!..Very few belly dance DVD's go down as a contribution to our art...but this one is!",1281657600,,1741,4.730263157894737

2267921,5,B00095NX9G,"I have a whole library of bellydance dvds and this is by far one of the best.  Rachel's instructions are very clear, the camera is focused on where it should be, and the pace is fast enough so that you are not bored but slow enough that you don't feel like you're doing ""speed yoga"" or are trying to learn a choreography in 4 minutes or less.  As others have mentioned, the choreographies are probably not going to work well for someone who hasn't ever taken a lesson.  If you are totally new to bellydance I would still recommend buying this set, just because disk 1  will prepare your body to dance well and you'll gain flexibility you never knew you had.  Still, for a total beginner (or someone whose only instruction has come from videos) I would recommend taking a good class to learn proper technique, posture, and basic dance terms before doing disk 2.  A good instructor will be able to watch what you are doing, keep you from injuring yourself, and I really do think that disk 2 will be very frustrating for someone who has never taken a class.  And HOORAY for the backbending instruction!  I have not found many instructors in my area who want to teach laybacks and such, and this is a very informative section that I will be watching over and over again.

Like one other reviewer I'm not really fond of the music chosen for the 1st choreography.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Any dancer who hopes to someday be part of a dance troupe will probably have to do a dance that they don't like or dance to a song they don't care for, so just because I don't really like the music doesn't mean that I will not bother to learn it.  Sometimes learning to dance to a song has caused me to learn to like it just because it becomes familiar and I'm having FUN!

The only problem I had with the yoga/exercise portions of this video are that the instructions flip-flop.  At the beginning, when she is facing you, the voiceover will say something like ""move your right arm...."" and she moves her left so she is mirroring you.  Further on into the workout the voicover will say to move your right arm/leg ands she actually uses her right arm/leg and therefore you will have to either do the opposite of what she is saying if you want to mirror her movements, or actually go the way she says which will NOT mirror her movements.  I think they could have done a LOT better with the voiceover as far as that goes.  It is confusing to most people to hear ""move left"" and see someone move to their right, especially when the instruction starts out so well.  Other than that this is a great dvd.",1280966400,6,2594,4.36875

the Bodines. Go figure. LOL. But you cannot beat ""Whisper Hungarian

I'm not a fan of tribal belly dance and I'm so impressed with the quality of this DVD. It is superb in content, instruction and choreography. I'm mostly impressed by Rachel's instruction: she is clear, direct and concise. She goes to the point and tells you exactly what you need to know. The way Rachel Brice presents herself and the dance studio location give me the feel that I'm in an individual class, just Rachel and I. It feels really personal and doable! It delivers what it promises. I can not see people getting disappointed with this buy.

The drills by themselves stand alone. They are lots of fun and a serious, very complete workout that makes me sweat. The yoga portions are very adequate, basic beginner's yoga that anybody can do. The 'full bow' pose could be the hardest asana for yoga newbies, but that's about it, nothing impossible here that nobody will get better over time. The yoga here is mainly focused on back bending and consists mostly in alternations of downward-dogs, modified planks (chaturanga dandasana) and upward-dogs (not official sun salutations). Since this is not a yoga DVD, I don't have anything to complain about. All I can assure is that the more yoga you practice, the better your dancing becomes and viceversa. Casually, I started vinyasa yoga and belly dance almost simultaneously, 4 yrs ago and was surprised of what a bomb they are together -ever since, I have been practicing and loving them both. Yoga and belly dance work in amazing, synergistic ways and Rachel does a nice job integrating them both in a single DVD.

The choreographies and performances are great! I love the fact that Rachel did NOT choose really easy, silly choreographies that you'll get bored over time. They are beautiful-to-watch, fun-to-do and APPROPRIATELLY challenging. Any dancer will be able to master the two choreographies with practice because Rachel dissects them in a very nice, easy way. I may have mixed feelings regarding the music tracts for the choreographies but nothing worth to take off a star. Tract in choreography #2 is lovely Hungarian classical music; sublime and seductive with the real serpentine feel. Tract in choreography #1 is Mexican band music (msica de banda de Mxico), with the tuba a striking instrument. I don't like this track because, agreeing with a previous reviewer, it gives me the feeling of a circus. (But it's all about taste and some Mexican belly dancers may really love it.) I got over this and truly enjoy Rachel's grace on displaying her art in any rhythm. Her performances are stunning and her customs are to die for. Again, one of Rachel's performance tracts takes me back to the circus, but again, I admired her grace and art instead. After all, out-of-the-box music -hideous for some, (me included) - is what tribal fusion it's all about.

Clearly, tribal fusion is not for everybody. It's not my style of belly dance (classic Raqs sharqi and Middle Eastern music are more my league) but I can appreciate the quality and inarguable talent of what the tribal princess, Miss Rachel Brice, offers here. End note: You don't have to be a hard-core tribal fan to enjoy this DVD. The belly dance technique presented here is a hard-to-find jewel that many of us haven't found anywhere else. This DVD is for any belly dance lover -any- tribal or not!

Bravo Rachel!",1279324800,8,3391,4.839655172413793
2267926,4,B00095NX9G,"This pains me - I seriously wish I could give this dvd 5 stars - it certainly deserves it for the content, and all the evaluations by the other posters are spot on. It is a tremendous instructional tool and exactly what we have been waiting for from Rachel. I just can't get past the music for the choreography, especially the first one. Everyone else seems to have described it as ""fun and peppy, upbeat"" or some such corresponding adjective, but I find it annoying, ridiculous and distracting (I will also throw in goofy and dorky as that is honestly how it sounds to me.)Thankfully, all the drills and wonderful instruction on Disc 1 are accompanied by something more traditional. But I was so sad to get to the choreography section - I find it odd and disconcerting to see bellydance done to something that sounds like circus music. Actually, it sounds more like a polka with the tuba and all (Yes, you guys, I am aware it is Hungarian or someone even said Balkan, but, whatever). While I appreciate the ""artistry"" of the musicians, and I understand that there is much personal interpretation and artistic license taken by each dancer, particularly in Fusion (which is what the word ""Fusion"" implies)I personally find it very inappropriate and I was longing to watch and learn combos from Rachel with a little more traditional ME sound and feel that I came to bellydance for in the first place. (As far as I know, Ive been trying to learn bellydance not the polka.) Oh well, I know it is just my one lone, personal sentiment. But I truly am disappointed to have to try to learn the choreography with the sound turned off (I REALLY hate it that much) and trying to apply it to some of my other music. Would it have been so hard to do a choreography that was a little more ""across the board""?

Now that I have that off my chest I would just like to say that, sans the aforementioned music - Rachel was fabulous, glorious, fantastic, incredible and really gave tremendous instruction and insight into achieving that ""style"" of hers that we all love so much. I will always be a Rachel fan so don't flog me too much when you read this.",1279238400,26,2134,4.51421188630491

As a tribal belly dance instructor I've been able to use adapt of the drills and moves into my regular class along with my usual curriculum.  Some of the material may be a bit challenging to a beginning student, but if one continues the use the dvd, she should be able to learn the material.

2267930,5,B00095NX9G,"This dvd is phenomenal and more than exceeded my expectations. I would classify myself as an advanced beginner. I already had a strong foundation with Ariellah's dvd and Jenna's Belly Dance Basics and Beyond dvd, and while they are more great dvd's, I was beginning to find myself getting bored. Enter Rachel Brice Serpentine!

It's VERY comprehensive. There is enough material on here, to keep the most ADD dancer busy for quite awhile. I won't go through everything thats on the dvd, as it's already been mentioned. But I will say that since working with this dvd, I've already seen major improvements in my flexiblity and dance!

As far as the level of this dvd, I believe that ALL levels can do this dvd. I would say that a very MOTIVATED beginner could definitely use this dvd, provided that they have taken A dance class before. Obviously if you've never ever done belly dancing, than you may find this challenging as you would any belly dancing dvd, I suppose. But I definitely think Rachel does a phenomenal job at making this dvd accessible to those just starting as well as the more advanced dancer. I'm surpised at myself that I'm actually able to do some of the choreography, no doubt I can only credit Rachel Brice and her drill section portion of the dvd because of this. She has a very good way of breaking down choreography in that it's not too slow (for advanced) but not too fast (for beginner's to get).

What made me a true believer, was that since purchasing this dvd, I've gotten other bd dvd's that left much to be desired. The production quality and content weren't nearly as up to par as Serpentine. It's definitely in a class all it's on.

All I have to say is make the investment. Where else are you going to get tons of drills, TWO choreographies, a thorough warm up and leg streghtening, tips for weekly practice, lecture and yoga for backward bending and all for under $23 bucks?! No where I'm sure. The only thing that could possibly make this dvd better, is if Rachel were to be wrapped in the package herself. Now I""m gushing, but I'm sure you guys get the idea.

Bravo Rachel, now I see why you really truly are the queen of modern tribal fusion!",1278633600,2,2180,4.536895674300254
2267931,5,B00095NX9G,"This is a wonderful DVD, especially for the price.  It's very advanced, so it's not necessarily for absolute beginners who don't know a choo choo shimmy from a Lebanese style shimmy, but if you are knowledgeable of the basics, this is a great tool to improve your dancing.  The combination of yoga and bellydancing drills is great for improving strength, techinique and stamina and Rachel builds on each activity as she goes so you can work up to that level without a lot of guess work and/or confusion as to what she just did.

Rachel's friendly, warm and often humorous narrative gave me a greater appreciation for her as a person, but also as a dancer/performer/choreographer.  As a newbie to bellydancing I didn't realize the intricacies and layering in her dance, but thanks to DVD 2 (choreography), I have a much greater appreciation for her skills and a broader outlook on the Tribal Fusion style as a whole.  DVD 1 is a great fundamentals builder and a must have for Tribal Fusion dancers looking to advance in the form.

I would recommend this DVD for the serious dancer who has a solid basic knowledge of bellydance technique and terms.  While I would not recommend this DVD as an introduction to bellydance, I definitely recommend it to intermediate dancers looking to move on to advanced work or for advanced dancers looking to polish their skill.",1278547200,,1359,4.782051282051282

You get tons of instruction, the production values are excellent, and she really takes you from A to Z for the whole Tribal Fusion conditioning experience. I was really not impressed with her first DVD, but she has come a very long way since then. She is very professional, thorough, and pleasant to watch. Her technique is simple, precise, and easy to understand, and she gives you the whole spectrum of her dance artistry from yoga drills to full-out performance. I intend to work with this DVD quite a bit in the coming weeks, as it seems to be an excellent training program for those who want to improve their Tribal Fusion skills. Highly recommended.",1277769600,,805,4.676056338028169
2267933,5,B00095NX9G,"Disclaimer - I am not really into workout videos, however I know that structured practice is useful in any endeavor, and videos are can be a very useful tool when it comes to workouts, etc. Out of the half dozen or so belly dance videos I've seen, the only one I really have liked is Aziza's Ultimate video because it's pretty intense and Aziza's personality makes the video fun.

I previewed Rachel's new video set yesterday and before the ""How to use this video"" section (which I watched first) was over, I knew this was an excellent purchase. The video is broken down in to sections and subsections (as others have mentioned) of technique discussions, yoga warm up and cool down, shimmy drills, hip work, upper body work, leg strengthening (which would be challenging to almost any athlete) and routines. The video is structured in such a way that you could do just one or two sections and get a complete ""work out."" Or you could take an entire afternoon and go through the entire video set. The DVD is set up specifically in this way and in the ""How to use this video"" section, Rachel reviews suggested practice schedules for those with other things to do in life, and those with more time to focus on dance.

Each section is detailed and thorough. The thing I ADORE about these sections is nothing is rushed. Other dance videos I have worked with seem to rush through things - you can tell that the artist is cramming as much as she can into one hour. In this video set, there is no rush... Rachel takes her time, in REAL TIME, to go through everything at a pace that is realistic. For example in the yoga section, when she says ""take a few breaths here,"" she is actually taking several slow yoga breaths!! I haven't even gotten that kind of realistic pace in an actual yoga class!! There are sections that are great for anyone, and sections (shimmy drills especially) that will be a real challenge to even advanced dancers (which I am not.)

Speaking of realistic, I also love how Rachel's presence in the video is very ""real,"" especially in the mini-courses section. I was able to take her choreography workshop a couple months ago, and was tickled pink that she used the very same moves, techniques, etc. from the workshop (albeit much more abbreviated in the workshop since she had so much material to cover) in this video, and her speaking style in the workshop is the same as in the video. Her personality comes out well in the mini-courses section, and during the shimmy drills section and a few other points in the video you can see her personality peek out with smiles and thumbs up... all while maintaining a very professional and relaxed demeanor. I also like how she has reminders to check posture regularly - she actually adjusts her own, and it's nice to see that even Rachel Brice has to double-check herself.

In short, I would declare this the best $25 I have spent on belly dance.",1277596800,2,2903,4.566218809980806

I have to honestly say that this is the best bellydance tape of this genre that I have purchased.  I wish it had been released years ago because it would have saved me a lot of money.
The yoga portion of the tape is gentle with clear and easy to follow instructions.  A lot of the poses are ones I used during physical therapy for strengthening my lower back but unlike my PT sessions this tape offered instructions that made it a lot easier to follow and in my opinion will prove to be more beneficial than the PT sessions I received because it is easier for me to follow.  I like the instructions of pulling in the low belly before doing any of the forward bends.  Also I noticed that there was usually a soft bend to her knees when doing the forward bends.  Doing these 2 things took a lot of the stress off of my low back.  I wish she would do an exclusively yoga tape.
Oh and by the way it also had one of the best shimmy drills offered on any tape/DVD I have seen so far.  This DVD was well worth purchasing.",1276646400,2,1209,4.004166666666666

2267940,5,B00095NX9G,"WDNY's already impressive Tribal Fusion lineup has an addition from the star who defines this genre: Rachel Brice herself. Starting with a nice and basic introduction from Tempest in 2006, they've steadily been taking it up a notch and then another notch until the just-released Serpentine.
I know that dancers who read my reviews will want an answer to the general all-encompassing question, ""So what's it like?"" As is often the case with WDNY's videos, I find it a difficult question to answer because above all, there is invariably a stupendous amount of content - more than from any other producer. And for a really low price. Serpentine is no exception. In fact, it's a 2-disk set in which Rachel Brice gives you the whole foundation of the unique signature style she dances. In four hours.

Yoga, the foundation
I think we've seen from Rachel's previous two DVDs that it is yoga that got her where she is. It is the very core of how she moves and on this set of disks, she takes you through a complete program of preparation through yoga and isolations, the way she believes will lead to ""strong, relaxed and sinuous movement."" In previous reviews of her videos, I remember saying we didn't want yoga from Rachel Brice, but the secret of how she dances. Well, it looks like yoga is that secret. If the aim is to dance like her and not do any yoga - forget it. In fact, this set is making me see the previous ones differently.
Both the disks in this set have yoga programs spread over them. The content does not particularly repeat what's on her previous videos, so this set doesn't make those redundant at all. As an Indian, I'm happy to see she refers to the Sanskrit names of all the asanas. I think that's a nice acknowledgement of where yoga came from in the first place. The yoga instruction is calm, disciplined and smooth - much as expected from Rachel Brice. It takes patience and motivation, until you get nice and addicted to it as people do, from where you're on to a good thing. Rachel uses the downward facing dog position as a base and builds sequences for the starting or Yoga 1 session that starts the first disk.. On the second disk is the back bending yoga session. This section is unsurprisingly challenging but all doable except for one scary asana - the one where you put your hands backwards next to your ears and then lift everything up. You're instructed to try this only if you're really comfortable with it. I'm surprised not to find some of the positions other dancers recommend when conditioning the body for backbends. There's the position where you sit between your knees (that takes weeks to get to) and then gradually bend back and place each hand on the feet. But well, since Rachel does very relaxed backbends, I have no quarrels with whatever her selection happens to be. If she says it works, I have no doubt it does.
Each of the two disks has a ""finishing yoga practice"" recommended to relax and stretch with. In fact, Rachel has a small guide on how to use this whole program and change which chunks or classes you pick up to work with on each day of the week. Nice touch, that.
Isolations, the technique
There's a ten-point posture check and then we begin with a shoulders drill. This is easy enough. But then, we go on to torso drill and things begin to change from other DVDs. Right from the start, she has foot patterns and timing variations for you to deal with. That's fantastic. While this is accessible to all levels and genres of belly dance, absolute beginners would do well to use a video focusing only on plain vanilla isolations first. Or learn these in live classes. It's interesting but here's where you'lll see Rachel Brice in regular belly dance mode. It's interesting that WDNY or Rachel chose to use music loops of rhythms instead of the modern music they usually go for. Well, it's better for concentration and timing but worse for motivation and variety. It's also more drilly, I guess. We cover side to side chest seesaws, isolated waves of the upper body, and bigger waves that involves the back. Then we get into hip work in short but powerful drills. These include obliques and glutes on the up and down, pelvic locks, alternating small pelvic circles, interesting maya variations and other layered moves involving footwork and chest moves.
The whole isolations session isn't what you'll find on other videos and has a lot to work with. Breakdown here is brief and there's quite a bit of layering and really, dancers who've got over the first brush with isolations will have a better time of it.
Shimmy drills
Overall quite a challenging shimmy drill. A few seconds into it you're layering with shoulders, arms and torso moves and undulations. At one point there was a shimmy on, torso roll down and chest slides going on all at the same time. Come prepared to do sharp clean moves! You work with locks as well. Shimmy layering on other moves such as slides and circles also feature, but there isn't a breakdown. As Rachel says, you just have to keep trying it. We also do the 3/4s. It's a killer drill - the killerest I've seen for shimmies because it's a lot of stuff squeezed into an intense and concentrated session.
Leg strengthening drills
There's a nice segment focusing on building strength in the legs, much needed for keeping moves going while you change level etc. Toe-heel changes, releves, knee lifts, grapevines with pass, chair poses and level changes feature in this section. It's a very nice addition to the whole program.
Two Choreographies
On Disk 2 are the goodies that we've wanted from Rachel Brice all along - combinations in her style. This is where we move into full-fledged tribal fusion style, but of the two choreographies, the first would help belly dancers in general to learn and sharpen some rapid-fire hip moves. The first choreography, set to an unusual piece of music, Kozarica Kolo, is sassy and uses a lot of contrast moves - sometimes slow and sometimes really fast. It's a short piece and divides into two combinations repeated. But tough for those of us who haven't worked on so much control.
The second choreography is set to Whisper Hungarian in my Ear and in this one, the moves luxuriate to the music. It's also about as short. In fact, I do wish both had been about twice as long. In the performance Rachel does at the end, the Hungarian piece is extended to more combinations. The choreography ends in a backbend and a truly serpentine and Rachesque pose. There's a great Practice Loops feature so you can keep running through the combo until you're happy with how you're learning it.
Instruction
In the yoga sessions, Rachel is calm as she slowly leads you the asanas. I find this a relief after working with some of the videos that never seem to pause for breath while shooting instructions at you. I think yoga practice needs tranquility - it's part of the package.
With the drills, she is businesslike as she makes you get on with it. And in the sessions for the choreographies, she's warm and funny. As ever, she looks exotic and amazing no matter what she does or says.
The Rachel Lectures
At the end of the second disk we have a fantastic set of lecture classes. In these, Rachel demystifies and advises you on various tricky aspects. These little lectures are accessible separately on the menu, in case you want to work with one part and not another. So here, Rachel takes up backbends and gives some critical advice on what to do and what not to do. Very important for the safety of your back. Then, she takes up basic footwork for those who are fairly new to belly dance. She explains and teaches four arm patterns --- simple ones. There's a portion about how to understand the basic beat of the music. And finally she teaches you how to do the Ujjayyi breathing for the yoga. These lectures add impressive depth to this already solid program.
I'm often amazed at how dancers can ""give away"" their skill, knowledge and style and that too for just a few dollars. This is one of those times. Although I still feel I'd have liked less yoga (which you can, after all, learn elsewhere) and more and easier combinations and arm paths, I think one can't complain. Two choreographies, drills, technique, yoga, advice -what more can one want!",1275004800,54,8258,4.629175187457396
2267941,5,B00095NX9G,"This is my first experience with a Rachel Brice belly dance class/dvd and I must say that I am quite impressed with her technique and ease of movement.  Serpentine Belly dance is jammed packed with 240 minutes of yoga, technique, choreography and mini lectures that will keep you interested for quite a while.
The classes take place in a studio with Rachel in front of a mirror for the dance sections.  The music for the yoga and technique classes is percussive and it is wonderful.  For a belly dance beginner like myself, rhythmic percussion makes it much easier to follow the accents.
This 2 dvd program is divided as follows:
Disc 1
Welcome
How to practice and suggested schedule
Yoga for belly dance
Leg strengthening drills
Isolation drills
Shimmy drill
Finishing yoga poses

Disc 2
Choreography 1:  An upbeat fun fast paced  dance done to  Hungarian music.
Yoga for backbending
Choreography 2: A slow senuous dance done to beautiful guitar music.  There is also floor work with a  lay back.
Each dance has a performance in full costume, a demo in the studio, step by step and practice loops for each combination.  There are 4 combos for each dance.
Finishing yoga poses
Mini classes: biomechanics of backbending, yogic breathing, arm and footwork patterns; musicality (how to count time,  , , 1/16 notes).  If you don't play an instrument or sing this will be very helpful.
2 performances by Rachel Brice

I have done this dvd 3 times so far.  The first time I did only the yoga on disc 1.  It is a slow paced, easy vinyasa flow of approx. 35 minutes.  I wasn't wowed by this style of yoga.  It is very hard to describe but it seemed to be too linear for me as I was expecting more of a circular, serpentine, dancey yoga ala Shiva Rea.  As such when I did the shimmy section of the dvd, I preceded it with the yoga flow from Shiva Rea's Yoga  trance dance dvd and it felt perfect for belly dancing.

The second time I did the shimmy section and combo 1 from choreography 1. The shimmy section, what can I say?  It looks so simple but I soon realized that there is so much going on.  Who knew how hard it would be to keep your hips moving at one rhythm, your torso at another rhythm and your feet and arms at still another rhythm.  I sweated bullets trying to keep up.  This is like no other workout I have ever experienced AND my stamina petered out  the way through.  Choreography 1 is long in that combo 2 repeats itself several times like a musical refrain.  However it is much easier to learn than Choreography 2.
Rachel is excellent and clear at teaching the choreography.  She counts beats.  Thank you Rachel.  You practice the combo w/ Rachel counting, with Rachel silent, with percussion music and then with the performance music.  You can also practice the combo loops which runs about ? times non-stop.  Each combo loop is its own chapter.
The 3rd time I did the warm-up from the Sera Soltice fundamentals dvd, and all of the drills on this dvd. This time I was able to get through the entire shimmy section.  I didn't quite get the upper body isolations, nor could I get the coordinated movement of keeping the shimmy going, moving the torso and feet all at different rhythms, but practice makes perfect. The instruction was excellent. I was soaking wet afterwards and felt satisfied. I can't wait to try it again.  My only complaint was that she didn't really explain how the shimmy works.  For that Sera Soltice's fundamentals dvd will be helpful.

I did the yoga for backbending one morning thinking that it was a complete yoga practice.  It is not.  It is about 15 minutes long and jumps right into backbending.  The poses include updog/down dog vinyasa; plank to push up vinyasa; locust variation; one legged camel prep; upward facing bow and supine poses.  My biggest complaint about this yoga class is that it did not include full camel and variations; and reclining hero. These two poses would have greatly prepared the dancer for the belly dance layback in choreography 2.  Why she left them out is a mystery to me.  Not everyone can do upward facing bow but everyone can do some variation of camel or heroes pose.

All in all this an excellent dvd for learning belly dance technique and choreography.  I will do the dance portions of it again and again as I think I am a belly dance convert...maybe.  As for the yoga, I have tons of yoga dvds that are more to my taste.  Get this dvd for the dance workshops as they are fantastic!",1274832000,7,4458,4.537013801756587

This 2 dvd program demystifies a beautiful path towards a transformatinal adventure of full body expression into tribal style belly dance. Rachel Brice, who well wears the adjective ""serpentine"", begins the two part program with a welcome and explains that the program is open level adding that ""consistancy"" is key in attaining your goals for this dance style. This program can be used in segments that can be applied daily in great length or in short segments for those with limited time. In addition, Rachel adds a mini class at the end of the program.

Disk one
Technique
Preparation and strengthening section include a fantastic conditioning workout based on standing and seated asanas, including proper breathing. For those of us who use yoga as a prelim to dance, you will find these poses beneficial for strengthening upper and lower back.  In addition,leg strengthening drills which I find useful for adding grace, fluidity and useful in ease of transition, isolation drills with 4 basic foot work patterns such as cross steps, triplets, grapevine and step touch and simple arm frames. Shimmy drills follow with challenging  shimmies topped with traveling undulations and mayas.

Disk two
All about choreography
Two beautiful dances with demos broken down simply. The practice loops very well allow an ease of transition from combo to combo to facilitate learning.
Dance one: ""Kozarica Kolo,""  by ""Brass Menazeri, fun, upbeat.
Dance two: ""Whisper Hungarian In My Ear,"" by the Toids.  Slow and enchanting, this is my favorite!
Finish the class with a yoga session (cooldown)
A Lecture class follows which is a great bonus- Rachel instructs on proper technique for backbends. footwork and arms patterns, yoga and proper breath which are essential to strengthen the body and create flexibility.
Two fabulous performances in the usual sinuous signature style that Rachel Brice is famous for which are utterly and absolutely breathtaking!
There is simply too much to write about. This program is abundant in technqiue, yoga, and key ingredients for a successful journey into ""Rachel style"" tribal fusion. It is wonderful that WDNY continues to bring forth fantastic instructors who share their creative success, and knowledge to enrich our belly dance lives.",1274659200,10,2570,5.253658536585366

Easy to understand

Not to mention, you do a lot of yoga. I have had fun learning belly dancing",1520035200,,118,3.9583333333333335
8057426,5,B00095NX9G,Such a thorough instructional dvd. Really recommend this for belly fitness but really good yoga segments too.,1517961600,,109,5.470588235294118
8057427,5,B00095NX9G,"This is my first introduction to Rachel Brice; heard of her, never saw her teach or dance, etc. However, I must say I think I picked a good one. I'm  very impressed with the structure of the DVD; I love her pacing, although I got a bit bored with the yoga portion. The drills are fab, and though I've been dancing for decades, if you tend to be both lazy and impatient like me, forced drills are a good thing.  It's good to get back to basics and focus.  I also love the fact that you can access online, the weekly sample schedules she suggests on disc 1, to help you stay focused and pack all that material into a purposeful, weekly practice; after all, practice makes perfect...results. You can also find TONS more info on her website RachelBrice.com.
I suggest you check it out if you want to find out more about her style of dance DATURA, various techniques, teachers who also teach her style globally, and just all things Rachel Brice - it's very cool.  Lastly, I must agree with many of the reviewers on two points; the first choreography music is just plain koo-koo. Not my taste all; learn the steps, use your own music. Second, this is not a DVD for rank beginners; possibly not even advanced beginners. You need a firm background in the mechanics of belly dance to get any real benefit out of it; definitely more than the average beginner might have. For dancers on that level, I wholeheartedly recommend most DVDs by ""The Belly Twins"", Neena and Veena Badasha. They have a great many that contain good instruction and great pacing; plus they're so darn cute to watch. That doesn't mean that Serpentine is wasted money.  Just think of it as something to work towards...",1515974400,,1679,4.528052805280528

8057430,3,B00095NX9G,"I love Rachel Brice, and I have always wanted to be able to dance like her..so I was super excited to get this! But as with most Bellydancing tutorials I always get stuck on the shimmying moves. I wish she would spend more time breaking down the moves, but I find I have to constantly rewind it and I just get more and more frustrated. I think the only way I'll actually learn is if I take a real class. Oh well..",1498953600,,413,4.048780487804878

8057432,4,B00095NX9G,"It's all good until you get to the choreography music which sounds like a band of kazoos playing the polka...it's awful.  What was she thinking?  It's not at all in keeping with the dance moves being taught.  Use your own music if you can.  The rest is great and she's a wonderful instructor, that's really my only gripe.",1488326400,,321,4.482758620689655
8057433,5,B00095NX9G,"I don't know why I didn't buy this sooner. It's been available for years. I took tribal bellydance classes for a long time, before I returned to graduate school and quit a lot of my hobbies to save money for school. Now I'm graduated, employed, and needing to get back into a consistent exercise routine. I can't seem to find anything I enjoy as much as I enjoy bellydance, and Rachel Brice is one of the best teachers anywhere. The series of leg-strengthening exercises alone make this set worth the price you pay. Although she has released few instructional videos, this one is very well done, and is a great foundation for her other classes, which she teaches online at DaturaOnline. I created a free account on Datura, and was able to get one free rental of one of her classes. Combine this DVD with her online classes available at Datura, and you will get a very good workout, and a very solid foundation in the basics of tribal fusion bellydance.",1488067200,3,952,4.573099415204679
8057434,5,B00095NX9G,"I really enjoy this set. The yoga DVD preps you for ease of movement. The choreography DVD breaks down the dance steps. If I were an absolute beginner, it would move a little too fast for me. But as I'm a bit experienced, I did fine with it. I recommend it.",1487635200,,257,4.0588235294117645
