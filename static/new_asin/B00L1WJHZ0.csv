8663227,3,B00L1WJHZ0,"Is there a bigger mark for mixed martial arts than ol' Hector Echavarria? I believe he's played MMA fighters more times than any other non-competitor, and now that he's returned from his four-year hiatus from the subgenre, he shows no sign of slowing down. ""Chavez: Cage of Glory"" seems to be another passion project for him, but it's merely another exercise for viewers. I don't think that many customers expect the world from Hector, so the movie exceeds expectations by default but still features plenty of disappointments.

The story: A struggling fighter (Echavarria) agrees to compete against the world champion (Heath Herring) so he can pay for his son's medical expenses.

The plot is basically a redo of Hector's previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unrivaled/dp/B0031XYLNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unrivaled</a>, not to mention a clear derivative of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAO5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>. As the writer, Echavarria's approach was to begin with a simple underdog storyline and pad it out with as much heartbreaking drama as possible - you see, not only does his son need an operation, but his wife (Sadie Katz) is seeking financial assistance, the greedy promoter (Patrick Kilpatrick) is trying to sabotage him, his manger (James Russo) repeatedly stiffs him, his corner man (Josh Samson) is a gambling addict, and he's repeatedly harassed by an aggressive gang leader (Danny Trejo). The lead character deals with endless tragedy, but not only does he avoid a mental breakdown, he's able to face the odds admirably. This is very much the kind of character Echavarria enjoys playing, but it's a little too much for me. Give me an openly egocentric Steven Seagal persona any day over Echavarria's tragic Christ figures.

That said, Hector has largely acquired the acting skills to support his screenplay. Apparently he's spent the last four years polishing his dramatic skills, as he remains engaging even in boring scenes - I mean, when he manages to make his retelling of a fight more interesting than the actual match itself, he's demonstrating some considerable chops. The rest of the cast does pretty well, too: along with Steven Bauer as Hector's priestly brother, this probably constitutes the best ensemble that Echavarria's put together. However, the utilization of the cast is thoroughly imperfect. James Russo is a no-reason jerk and Danny Trejo's role of a pointlessly sadistic thug is probably the worst he's ever had.

The fight content is a mixed bag, with at least one decent match and at least two absolute stinkers. I'm not sure who's to blame - the filmmakers or the studio - but someone involved with this either hasn't seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III/dp/B003FXXNBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III</a>&nbsp;or believes that slow motion and blocky choreography are desirable. There are only five fights, which is a pretty low count for Hector, and they slowly build up to the passable showdown against Herring. Echavarria is commendable for his physicality, stamina, and lack of reliance on stunt doubles, but his fight scenes just can't compete in a market that includes the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falcon-Rising/dp/B00M1CFRDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falcon Rising</a>. I really wish Hector would attach himself to a more innovative director who would be able to make better use of his talents.

I think this qualifies as a Christian film, given the prominence of prayer in it; take that as you will. Personally, I was not satisfied with the feature, which is easy to sit through but does not improve on its star's previous offerings. Established fans of Hector's may be satisfied, but I can't recommend this one as anything but a curious rental.",1430265600,,3952,5.795180722891566
