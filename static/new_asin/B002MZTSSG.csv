8374343,3,B002MZTSSG,"These are two great fantasy movies
with martial arts mayhem galore.
If you like fantasy cinema,
I am sure you will not
be disappointed with these
two examples of it,
Japanese style.

What you will not like is this
release/version.
Full-screen in the worst sense
of the word, they are criminally
""cropped"".
Also, the English dubbing is lame.
Much of the music, I assume is not
as originally intended.

Seek out the wide-screen versions
in the original Japanese language
with the original score.",1285286400,,493,4.927710843373494
