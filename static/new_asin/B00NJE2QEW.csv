6666061,5,B00NJE2QEW,"I saw this movie while flying on a Cathay Pacific flight to Bali. I wasn't able to finish so i was very happy to buy this movie as soon as I found it. This is an amazing movie and has it all. Great story, great writing, great drama , action and romance and I can't forget to mention the singing and dancing was well done. It's also a very funny movie and just overall one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. because of this movie I got into watching Indian cinema and now I'm a massive fan. I highly recommend it. Oh and another great movie I'd like to recommend is Ek Tha Tiger and Bang Bang! as well.",1456012800,,611,4.0578512396694215

6666071,5,B00NJE2QEW,"Salman Khan was very entertaining. ""KICK"" definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. It was great the way you were taken back and forth, wandering whether he was a good guy or a Villain in this movie.",1423872000,,200,4.153846153846154
6666072,5,B00NJE2QEW,Awesome movie! Funny. Like action. Shows Salman Khan feels secure about who he is and how his career has developed. I enjoy watching his movies.,1419811200,,144,4.8
6666073,4,B00NJE2QEW,"It's so weird. The lead looks like Javier Bardem if Bardem wasn't so self serious all the time. Basically, Skyfall Javier Bardem but this time as the good guy with musical sequences...Look at what amazing things this film can make you write.

Like most Indian movies, it's a hodge podge of other films and different genres that hopefully add up to something new by the time it is all done. It's similar to The Predator where they combined commando movies, buddy drama, space aliens, and The Most Dangerous Game. This instead is a mash up of anti-hero superheroes, musicals, kung fu films, heist films, romantic comedies, social commentary (shallow and silly), and maybe a few others I forgot. I loved it. It's so crazy.

The actors all work pretty well for what they need to do. The story is broad. They just need to be likeable enough while doing distinctly dislikeable things in some cases (one character is more than a bit racist and fascist and the other is very much might makes right...typical Hollywood stuff but much more open about it).

If there's one good reason to watch the movie it's that there is a musical sequence where the actress looks like she walked into a 1980's Danzig music video...but the music is distinctly Shakira like.",1419379200,3,1247,4.7373271889400925
6666074,4,B00NJE2QEW,"It's a little difficult to describe this film.  I love Salman and am an ardent fan-- not because he's such a great actor, but because of his overwhelming charisma.  There are just some actors who are compelling to watch.  Like Marilyn Monroe.  Or Humphrey Bogart.  They might not have the acting chops of Meryl Streep or Sir Laurence Olivier or Dustin Hoffman.  But they compel you.

Salman is one of those actors that hypnotize the viewer just by being on the screen.  He is magnetic.  And in this film, he is magnetic by being schizophrenic, which eerily reflects his real persona.

In Kick, Salman portrays two different people: Devi, the amiable, shiftless, high-IQ nomad who can't keep a job because it doesn't provide him with the necessary ""kick,"" and Devil, the scourge of the hapless police, who are always one step behind the clever robber.  But who is Devi/Devil?  The key lies in his motivation and it is the key to Salman, as well.

So we have a film which is packaged as an intense, stunt-driven film, filled with breathtaking action sequences, but is really a meditation on how a person's motivation defines them.  Devi found his ""kick"" and Devil was the result.  And Salman, who is characterized as the ""bad boy"" of Bollywood, stands revealed as the man with a golden heart.

So, how to characterize this film?  The songs and dances are standard, though not inspired.  They are actually a little disjointed, seeming to serve as a sort of shorthand, rather than amplification, of what the characters are experiencing.  Salman's chemistry with Fernandez has been touted, but this chemistry is rather pallid when contrasted with his chemistry with Preity Zinta.  However, his love for Mithun, who plays his father, is undeniable and, once again, eerily parallels his relationship with his own father.

To sum up, this film is well worth watching because it is entertaining, with great action sequences.  But it is an essential film for anyone who wants to unravel (or at least witness) the scintillating enigma that is Salman.  Part Devil, part lovable Devi, this is a man who compels you to watch both.",1418947200,,2116,4.849162011173185

8678681,5,B00NJE2QEW,It's too bad that Salman Khan doesn't sing in more of his movies. His deep voice is very appealing to Western ears. The music sets your heart pumping and it is impossible not to start dancing. The story can be a bit silly at first but Salman brings it home.,1505260800,,257,4.16

8678683,4,B00NJE2QEW,"Devi (Salman Khan) is an adrenaline junkie and does every thing he can to get a kick.  After breaking up with his girlfriend (Jacqueline Fernandez), he becomes a daring thief known as ""Devil"" who risks it all on high profile escapades.  Randeep Hooda plays the police officer who has made it his personal goal to catch Devil.

There are times when this action packed film is a bit confusing (keeping up with locations, for instance) but that doesn't detract from the fun.  Khan is wonderful in his role, as is Hooda. Though Fernandez is not as strong an actor as the other two, she acts naturally and believably.  The songs (with the exception of ""Hangover"") and choreography are average, but the filmography is grand.  Overall, this thriller will keep the viewer thoroughly entertained.",1501113600,,787,4.879699248120301
