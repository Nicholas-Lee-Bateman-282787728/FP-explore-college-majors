8724840,5,B011PS0SZW,"I love this DVD. I am an adult who wants to take ballet classes but I don't have the time and there's no classes nearby. I bought a pair of videos but this one is my favorite. The instruction is wonderful. I love that you can choose to go through the whole class without the instructions. These dvds are expensive yes, but worth it to me, less than one month's worth of ballet class. I can't wait to progress to the next one.

Since I had a few months prior experience in ballet class when I was a younger adult, I began with this DVD and not the absolute beginner one.

It helps to have your own barre. I made my own out of PVC in about half an hour for about $30. I found an easy pattern to follow on Pinterest and it really helps me during this video.",1485129600,3,754,4.02
8724841,5,B011PS0SZW,"I am 40 y.o. beginner, with no previous training in ballet. I discovered Finiss work about a year ago, on Amazon, when I was searching for introductory level ballet DVDs for adults. My experience with his initial Absolute beginner DVD in the red series left me deeply impressedand hungering for more. To say that Finis has profound understanding of ballet as an art would be an understatement; but he also possesses keen pedagogical sensitivities that enable him to make this knowledge accessible for adults who never set a foot in the ballet studio before!

This second DVD Beginner Ballet Barre is true sequel to the first: Finis intensifies the training in all the aspects that were introduced in the Absolute Beginner DVD: his signature almost isometric plie`, proper getting on your leg, balancing, strengthening of the feet, and spotting. New thingssuch as positioning in space, tombe` lunge, preparation for pirouette, and arabesqueare also introduced. As before, Finiss teaching attitude is very encouraging: the way he introduces new concepts and movements makes you believe that ballet is not only for the young and the flexible. His instruction is astonishingly clear and to the point. And, his snippets of wisdomyou are only as good as your plie`-releve`; keep your brain in your foot; arabesque is opening your heartstay with you long after the video is over.

Admittedly, this is not an easy DVD: I find myself going back again and again, because it takes time to truly strengthen your feet and to make it a second nature to work from your supporting leg. But every effort brings forth real results. First, there are ballet-related results: I can also do things that I have not been able to do before (e.g., the beloved pirouettes  now, I have not become a perfect turner by any stretch of imagination, but there is a world of difference between toppling over at high speed and being able to actually get around all the way without the manic flailing of the arms. I also feel I am getting more out of my regular ballet classes, because I am beginning to recognize the underlying principles (isometric plie, work in opposition, stand in # 1, expansion-contraction, lead from the foot, importance of the supporting leg, etc.).  Secondly, there are life-related results: I observe improvements in my posture, core strength, and daily balance.

Finally, the aesthetics: this DVD is high-quality film, set to a melodic musical score, and a beautiful demonstrator, Melissa Elstein, is a joy to watch (even if a challenge to imitate!). I strongly recommend this DVD to my fellow adult ballet students and to all who is interested in a fitness program that is both effective and safe. Thank you, Finis!",1481328000,6,2708,4.969094922737307
8724842,5,B011PS0SZW,"Great, great video for adult beginners who want a challenging yet doable full barre.  Level of clear, instructional detail is way more than what youd get in some other offerings on Amazon, with their bargain basement prices and corny cover graphics.  Head and shoulders above all that.  Its really convenient that there is also an exercise mode where you can plow through the whole barre without the instructional parts.  The exercises build on each other so logically so that by the time you're about to do the half and full pirouettes, you're totally prepared for them.  Just like its subtitle, emphasis is on your standing leg, and working the plie-releve correctly; he also emphasizes how to work your feet at the barre.  He gives you little demos of the wrong way to the exercises, which is really helpful because then you know what to avoid.  Basically he lays out the process of each exercise and tells you which muscles should be engaged.  Another thing thats cool is that inside almost all the exercises he incorporates short little relaxation stretches.  The demonstrator is a beautiful, gracious lady and a great sport!  Its nice that at the end of the video he sits down and talks with her so we see her as a person, not a mute ballet doll.  This DVD looks and is high level production and instruction. Its an investment, really, that you can refer back to over and over again, and believe me, you will need to because there are so many issues that he discusses.  Oh, and if you don't know who he is, just google him.",1461974400,4,1529,4.622222222222222
8724843,5,B011PS0SZW,"Most ballet programs for adults just use the same old drills that are used to teach children. That approach can work for kids -- their bodies are more resilient and absorb the information faster  -- but it's pretty frustrating for adults.

Finis re-invented the older methods of teaching ballet. He broke down the basic, foundational movements of dance and found simple ways to explain them to his adult students. I'm sure the method is helpful for kids, too, but for adults, it's a game-changer. Finis's method makes it possible for people to learn ballet later in life -- something that wasn't possible before with the older methods.

I started Finis's program in my late 40s (no prior dance background) and it has made remarkable changes in my body -- more than yoga or zumba ever did. My posture has improved, my core muscles are stronger, my legs and back are more flexible and more whole body looks leaner. And dancing is a lot more fun than yoga!

There's a reason people are willing to pay more for these DVDs -- they're worth it. You'll keep them for years and go back to them again and again. Even if you stick with dancing and you move on to more advanced movement, you can still get a lot of mileage out of this basic barre routine.

The format is clear and easy to use -- you can choose to watch each of the 15 exercises individually, or watch them all continuously, with no interruption. You get all the proper, precise ballet terminology along with the simple, clear instructions, and Melissa Elstein demonstrates with musicality and grace.",1461974400,5,1555,4.660583941605839
8724844,5,B011PS0SZW,"This DVD is a must-have for anyone interested in starting ballet, especially adults.

I was/am a long-distance runner  for 20+ years - with a desire to try something new. Thats when I discovered Finis Jhung.

Other DVDs I had tried assume that you come to ballet with extraordinary flexibility.  I don't think I watched longer than 2 minutes before I turned them off, thinking, This must not be for me.

Finiss DVDs are a little more expensive, but well worth it!  (As anyone can see from his Facebook feed, Finiss resume is beyond compare. He danced with the Joffrey for many years, and has taught now for 40+ years. He also taught the Billy Elliott kids on Broadway.)

So much of ballet instruction relies on rote, almost military-style repetition of movements  with little in the way of understanding what those drills are meant to accomplish.  Finis Jhung is the opposite of that  his style of barre work is much more intuitive, much more connected with actual dancing.

Hes also refreshingly democratic.  Rather than cultivating an air of exclusivity that sees people discouraged from ballet for not being a) super-flexible, or b) a teenager or younger,  Finiss  technique throws opens the door for anyone interested in moving your body in a new way, and exploring ballet.

Also - the beginner DVDs are for both women and men. (Guys  - don't let the female demonstrator put you off!)  I cant recommend them enough!",1461628800,10,1419,4.821576763485477
8724845,5,B011PS0SZW,"No matter where you are as a dancer, this video will reveal a hidden side of what makes ballet look so beautiful. While in many classes, especially for beginners, the focus is on positions and steps, people end up imitating everything, without any knowledge of the movement process and how to use their bodies. This DVD will teach you exactly what any good dancer needs to know and do: exercises to strengthen the feet by using the floor, insistence on doing any movement slowly so that you feel how you use your muscles, and what muscles you need to use. There is also an excellent explanation and exercises about how essential it is for a dancer to lengthen their psoas muscle in order stand tall and dance well. If you are struggling with your pirouettes, you will learn how to do the right preparation so you can turn successfully. Finiss natural demeanor, the clarity of his explanations and his sense of humor plus the demonstrator Melissa Elsteins effortless execution make this video a truly enjoyable experience. This is the Finis Jhung Ballet Technique at its best!
