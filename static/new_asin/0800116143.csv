167051,5,0800116143,This movie is the best generic movie I have ever seen in my life! A love story about a sweet and beautiful loud mouth from New Jersey. The beautiful and tacky young woman purposely seeks a rich man with class and style from New York. The wonderfully handsome and stunning man is running from his past. He seeks a rich and classy lifestyle of money and status. The woman of his worst nightmares runs into his brand new Mercedes Benz. She falls in love with him instantly and stalks her way into his heart. The wonderfully dressed and groomed man is reminded of his past by dating the loud fun loving woman. He  is caught between two worlds. Which world will he choose? Buy the movie and see. You will watch this campy movie over and over again. There is a special spark about it. The woman's fun loving wise cracking friends makes this movie a well beloved friend of your vhs collection. A great romantic saturday night flick. A winner!,1048464000,31,935,4.4678362573099415
167052,5,0800116143,"I first saw this movie about 6 years ago on T.V., and I never knew the name of it until I was channel surfing and saw it again a year ago.  I fell in love with it the first time I saw it and even more the second time, that is why I now own it.  Every girl who has been in a relationship needs to see this movie.  I have watched this movie so much, my picture quality isn't so perfect anymore.  The ending just melts me away.  Jamie Gertz is wonderful and Dylan McDermott is even hotter in this movie then I have ever seen him before.  I laughed with this movie and I cried with it too.  I highly recommend this movie, and I know for a fact you won't be dissapointed once you've seen it.  I just hope they release it on dvd in the near future.",1047686400,15,742,3.8675496688741724
167053,5,0800116143,"I first seen the movie on TV, I loved it so much I had to buy the tape. I have watched it so many times, and it still has the same magic to it as when I first watched it. The music is great, I wish there was an available soundtrack I would buy it also. You just have to see the movie to judge for yourself, if you like romantic love stories, then this one is it, as far as .....Dylan McDermott.... why else would I watch the movie a million times over!",999043200,7,452,3.8191489361702127
167054,4,0800116143,"Although not a great film, Jersey Girl is a well-done -- and very enjoyable -- version of the classic Cinderella story. In this case Cinderella (played by beautiful Jami Gertz) is a very pretty but very unsophisticated girl from New Jersey who sets out to find a Prince Charming in Manhattan. She succeeds in meeting him by accidentally wrecking his new Mercedes with her dilapidated Volkswagen. The subsequent events in their developing relationship are similarly unconventional, and even nearly disastrous. Nevertheless -- as it must in any good telling of the Cinderella story -- love wins out in the end. This movie isn't quite on a par with Pretty Woman, but it is an awful lot of fun.",980812800,,690,4.8559322033898304

167056,5,0800116143,I absolutely love this movie. It is perfect for any woman who has learned to accept herself even when an ignorant man cannot. It also shows just how close women can be in their friendships.  This movie also shows what  lengths we will go to for our friends.....or for true love.,941760000,,278,4.431372549019608
167057,5,0800116143,"I had to watch this movie for an American Studies class in college and fell in love with it. The tagline promotes it as ""a Cinderella story with big hair"" but Jamie Gertz's character does it all without the  help of a fairy godmother. This movie is for anyone who felt awkward or out  of place in front of the ""cool"" people. As the opening credit's  declare ""Jersey groove, she's got a jersey groove""",925171200,8,400,4.378378378378378

167116,2,0800116143,This movie wasn't really that good. Reason being that the main character seemed rather pathetic and border line stalkerish. I wanted to jump in the screen and shake her for being so needy. Also the plot was kind of all over the place. Her acting is very good. Just not a good interesting movie. It flip flops too much almost like the writters did not know how they wanted it to end. Not a great movie.,1477872000,,401,4.2894736842105265

167218,4,0800116143,"I have been wanting to find and watch this movie for many years as I am a Dylan McDermott fan. I had seen it before but the journey to see it again was a long one. Jersey Girl is an entertaining but unbelievable film. Jamie Gertz plays a Jersey girl named Toby. Dylan plays a successful NYC businessman named Sal. Their worlds could not be further apart. Toby decides she wants better for herself. She wants to date a man from NYC. She happens to spot Sal and in a desperate attempt to meet him, she intentionally crashes into his car. Because of the accident and because Toby wants to get to know Sal, she keeps popping up in his life until finally Sal becomes curious enough to want to go on a serious date with her. If you want to know what happens next, you will have to watch the movie. The movie is a modern day fairytale, not meant to be taken seriously. Dylan McDermott and Jami Gertz fans will enjoy Jersey Girl",1419292800,,920,4.2628571428571425

167250,5,0800116143,I also caught this movie on TV and instantly fell in love with it. I can and have watched it over and over. My one question is this movie has one of the best soundtracks and it is not available why is that. There is one song on here called Jersey Girl and it is so beautiful but you can not find it anywhere it was written by Tom Waits and sung by Jack Mack and the Heart attacks. If anyone can shed some light on this I would appreciate it. If you have not seen this movie you really are missing a GEM.,1400112000,,503,3.8461538461538463
167251,5,0800116143,"I love this movie. Jami Gertz shines and is absolutely lovable. Dylan McDermott is good looking and is caught trying to leave behind his poor past to move on to a brighter, wealthier future. He has it all...a great job, a  beautiful girlfriend from upper east side, a great place to live, and a great car! That is when Jami, this Jersey girl, smashes into him. She is determined to make this sophisticated guy fall in love with her, and along the way she realizes that he may not be as sophisticated as she thought. He definitely needs a little ""Jersey"" in his life. He realizes that maybe there is nothing wrong with Jersey, and he doesn't need to forget who he is and where he is from to be successful. ""Jersey"" is definitely missing in his life!",1392940800,,748,4.420289855072464

167282,3,0800116143,"Not the version I wanted but hey who would have thought there would be two different movies with the same name?  Typical chick flick where they look at a magazine and dream about falling in love with someone out of their league and then goes out and tries to find that person at a Mercedes dealership.  Comparable to a guy reading a Playboy magazine, falling in love, and then going to the Playboy mansion to find that person.  Interesting how a gal can fall in love and the movie is PG.  When a guy falls in love the movie is rated X.  Anyway, she gets tired of doing the same ol same ol every Friday and wants something new.  Her three friends are bored and counter the boredom by eating.  But the Cinderella of the movie, the one who NEEDS to eat thinks she's hot and falls in love with a guy who is so out of her league by running his car into  bus bench.  Mean while rich boys girlfriend is so horny suddenly becomes a bitch and Rich boy decides maybe the girl with the annoying accent isn't so bad after all.  After the second date they are already in bed making the bed springs squeak if ya know what I mean.  Now rich boy wants to take skinny girl to the Ball but she has nothing to wear (Women could have a closet as big as the United States and still have nothing to wear) until her Dad buys her a dress that has as much frill as a Katey Perry concert.  If this were to look like a certain fairy tale she would have worn glass slippers but I guess the writers didn't want to seem so obvious.  At the fancy ball, we find the first girlfriend showing up with some guy and her acting very snobbish - Who would have guessed she would be there!  Well, it turns out later on the first Girlfriend gets even by making rich Boy get rid of his goldfish.  oh, this sets off Rich boy to no end.  He thinks, You can't do that to my goldfish!  And he realizes despite all the money, the cars, fancy job that his life is a complete and utter bore and that life would be so much better if he dated someone that still lives at home with her parents.  So, he drives his $75,000 Mercedes into a fire hydrant.  Oh, this is really true love!  They realize they are made for each other and they will live off of the mere pittance the girl makes running a daycare and they all live happy ever after.

167300,4,0800116143,"I think the majority of these reviews are for the wrong movie. This is the Jersey Girl that came out in the 80s and stars Jamie Gertz and Dermot Mulroney, not the Jersey Girl that stars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. If you are looking for a review of the Ben Affleck version, then I can't help you. But I can tell you that 80s version is pretty silly and predictable, but I absolutely love it. It's one of those movies I watch every time it comes on TV, so I decided it was time to buy it. So glad Amazon has it in stock! I have always liked Jamie Gertz and I am a child of the 80s, so I guess that's why I like it so much. Plus Dermot Mulroney is pretty darn hot in it. It's the classic girl gets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy back plot. Love it!",1360195200,,754,3.9025974025974026

Jami Gertz' character is a Pre-School Teacher, however, and she is wonderful with the children.  This is good to watch with gal pals or with one's significant other.",1356048000,,332,4.9818181818181815

167305,5,0800116143,"I love this movie (had it before on VHS) but it got lost and I was so disappointed, but then I decided to hunt for it on Amazon, and I was so happy to find it there - it's a beautiful story about young love, but with some really good lessons, on what friendship really means, and respect for one's parents, in it as well. It's so good.",1348531200,,335,3.9411764705882355
167306,5,0800116143,"Another mcdermott movie i've fallen in love with. until seeing parts of this flick on youtube, i didn't know there was another ""jersey girl"" movie, just the one with ben affleck, jennifer lopez, and liv tyler. although it somewhat depicts how we tend to view people from new jersey, (i.e. big hair, fake nails, diners, having either irish or italian heritage, etc.), it's a very cute love story of a woman doing everything she can to get the man of her dreams and my favorite part of the movie is when sal and toby are making love and when morning falls in the big apple after they've finished having sex, sal(mcdermott)looks at toby(gertz)and realizes that he's falling head over heels for her, then he's back in bed with her, smooching her hand and then lifts her face up and smooches her while she's asleep. if an uber hot guy did that to me after a night of passion, i'd be in heaven and breathless. watch this movie if you like love stories about a chick wanting mr. right or to drool over dylan, as i've said a thousand times, he's one very good looking man and this flick is no exception. would totally recommend this flick,oh, forgot to mention that you'll get to see senor mcdermott in his birthday suit in the flick, GIGGITY!",1345766400,,1235,4.517857142857143

It's about a girl from Jersey who wants to meet a sophisticated guy so she goes to a BMW dealer and sees the man of her dreams. After causing him to wreck his brand new car she persues him diligently and they eventually fall in love. It has its bumps, just like every love story but I think it's awesome. This is another typical 80s movie but a definite must see!",1310688000,,479,4.052631578947368

She decides on the spot he's the one for her, based solely on superficial appearances, and then she begins stalking him!  That she succeeds in getting this guy is something that could only happen in a movie as dopey as this.
Jami Gertz's performance was one long screech while Dylan McDermott's was based solely on his ability to smile and look good.  This was no Cinderella story; this is why they have restraining orders!

Not a keeper!",1304726400,,554,4.622448979591836

She meets the man of her dreams when she causes a car accident with his fancy car.  I love her clothes, her hair and nails, her mannerisms.  Her girlfriends are just fab with their own big hair and brassy personalities. I know these people and I like them; every town has it's own Jersey girls.  The story is one that's been told many times but this one is more fun to watch and has great heart.  I just wonder where the Bon Jovi music was because that's the music these girls would have listened to.",1189728000,,622,4.327586206896552
167324,4,0800116143,"So we all know the classic cheesey 80s movies...from the rat pack movies like ""Sixteen Candles"" to the others like ""The Secret of My Success"" and ""Working Girl."" If you're looking for another romantic comedy, this is a true gem from that genre. And yeah, I know it's from the early 90s, but really, let's be honest, sometimes you can't tell the difference. So we all know it's no Oscar/Academy Award winning movie. And maybe it's  predictable too. But there is something to be said for a cute movie that just makes you smile. Another plus is that it stars a young Dylan McDermott. He's pretty adorable and yeah, he smiles a lot, but it's all part of what makes this movie endearing. And now, after seeing this movie, I'm suddenly a fan of his. I've seen my share of random 80s flicks both good and bad and this one really surprised me. So take a chance on this one.",1188000000,5,865,4.40625
167325,5,0800116143,"For anyone who grew up in ""Jersey"" and is familiar with the unique cultural aspects of the northeastern part of the state you will absolutely love this movie. The four women who play the ""girl"" parts are all exceptional in their portrayals of gum poping, tough talking, wise-guy (girls) with Jersey attitudes. If you're a guy from Jersey then you already know that a Jersey girl is the sexiest girl there ever was to roam the planet. All these girls.....albeit huge hair, tacky cloths, sewer mouths, and even a bit over weight all exude sex appeal. It's all very remarkable. Another ""exciting"" aspect is watching all the background B roll and scenery that all but makes you want to be sure you have your toll change ready before you get to the next scene. You'll see White Castles, Route 4, the turnpike, and if you really look close you will see the absolute ""King Of Jersey"" Vegas Lounge Legend Pat Galo making a cameo appearance. If you're from Jersey that alone is worth the price of the DVD! Jersey Girl is a must have for any loyal and dyed in the wool Jersey Girl. What am I saying.....this film is a must for anybody who has an ounce of romance in their heart. Jersey.....Jersey Girl Will Make You Proud!",1170028800,4,1212,4.538812785388128

The Jersey characters are a bit over the top, but Jamie Gertz wore her big hair with pride.

It's a bit hard to believe at first, but you gotta have hope when it comes to finding love. Rent this one for the sappy romantic in you or, at the very least, to glimpse Mr. McDermott's bare behind! Woohoo!",1169596800,,499,4.354838709677419

I also hate Ben Afflec (Shakespear in love, Changing Lanes)and any movie with a child star. That aside, I adored Jersey Girl, and this is coming from a 14 year old male. It's a great story, with witty dialogue by the Master of dialogue, a teriffic script. I think that a lot of these negative reviews coming from wannabe critics, were influenced by the general contempt for this movie. I thought it was awesome and hilarious. My advice, rent it, and make up your own mind, not be led by the general consesus.

It's a wonderful, love story. Probably one of my favorite movies. I actually recorded this movie thinking it was the other Jersey Girl movie with Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. I totally liked this one better. The girls voice was completely annoying, along with her choice of style. But all in all, this movie is amazing =]

Start with Working Girl, substitute New jersey for Staten Island, then take away the plot, the character development and just about everything else and you're left with the big hair and a plotless love story.  Jamie Gertz has had much better material to work with and Dylan McDermott's primary mode of expression in this role is a lazy smile.  Give the actor some dialogue! The ending was so contrived that there's no reward for sticking with this movie to the end.  You know how it will turn out just from reading the marquis.",1139097600,6,593,4.673076923076923
