And more in death about the story.",1416528000,,160,4.193548387096774
1896988,5,B00009Y3P8,"A film based on a very interesting concept. The thought behind the storyline is very intricate, making the viewer very absorbed as to how the story will end. I do wish there was more character development for the main 2 characters (like their background, etc...)

Overall, I think this is a great film to own. It really challenges people to imagine life from a different perspective and teaches a valuable lesson about trying to understand people who are different from you.

NOTE: I typically watch anime in Japanese and I have yet to watch the dubbed audio of this disc, so I do not know how accurately the story is interpreted.",1416441600,,630,4.666666666666667

1896990,4,B00009Y3P8,"4 1/2 STARS -- GORGEOUS ANIMATION AND FACINATING REALMS -- SECONDARY CHARACTERS CAN BE THIN

This post-apocalyptic tale of perspective is a very unique take on alternate worlds. The voice acting is top notch and the animation quite haunting at times. The wonderful worlds created here are fascinating and stunning to the eye. Whether it's the subterranean world of Patema, or the green surface world of her new found friend Eiji, it all dazzles. (They spell his name ""Age"" on the box, but Eiji is the actual romanized Japanese spelling.) The main characters are well fleshed and charming, but secondary characters can be thin.

THE STORY: Patema is the daughter of a chief and lives in a subterranean world where it is forbidden to travel out to the danger zone. She is vibrant and wrestles to explore, fueled by tales of another world and a photo of that world given her by a friend. However, something is strange about Patema's world and objects from the outside seem to float to the ceiling and defy gravity. During and event while exploring, Patema finds herself on the surface world and face to face with a boy named Eiji. However, she is floating upside down and in danger of falling into the sky. You see, gravity seems to affect Patema's people and the surface in opposite ways. This danger of falling upwards is a frightening thing to Patema. Eiji and Patema become close friends and share that they each have lost their fathers. Patema's subterranean world is restrictive, but we find that the beauty of the surface world is also tempered by its own restrictions. There is an evil organization that indoctrinates the people and teaches them they should not look toward the sky. They also hunt ""Inverts"" as Patema's people are called. We come to learn of the disaster that causes these gravitational anomalies. More worlds are there to be discovered and there is a little romance as well. Plenty of lessons on perspective and tolerance also.

Though I highly recommend this movie, it does have just a few moments where it loses steam. It's beautiful and complex enough for adults, but light enough for older children. There are some dark moments as the ""Bat People"" of the surface security forces hunt inverts that could scare really small children. But, this is a beautiful tale with plenty of animation eye candy. I suggest renting it first rather than buying it sight unseen.",1415836800,4,2387,4.817073170731708
1896991,4,B00009Y3P8,"Very nice anime to watch with your young kids (6-12) - there are very little violence and it's subdued. Story is nice (a bit weak, this is why 4 stars)  and watching it could spark some interesting questions about the world.

The BluRay itself recorded very well with DTS 5.1 English dubbing.  English voice cast performance is very good.",1415664000,2,338,4.694915254237288
1896992,5,B00009Y3P8,Lovely film with a very unique premise,1414972800,2,38,4.571428571428571
1896993,5,B00009Y3P8,"What if you met someone who was upsidedown? Or inverted? Meet Princess Patema, who lives underground. However, what she doesn't know is that there is a whole new world outside of her own...and that the people she will meet are Inverted. Meet Age, a young boy in a VERY crazy dystopian strict setting where you are forbidden to look up at the sky, where those who committed sins are sucked up into the unknown...and he just happens to be having a pretty boring normal day too, until he meets Princess Patema, who is Inverted.

Patema had been knocked out of her world after someone tried to kill her, and then meets Age, who decides to protect her until he can get her back home...problem is, that Patema will be sucked into the sky if she isn't holding on to something...so in a crazy, hilarious turn of events, Patema and Age have to cling to each other to stop her from being pulled away. Add in his world's crazy leader who is terrified of the Inverted people, that he wants nothing more than to destroy her, and you have an awesome crazy movie.

Why watch? Besides the insane concept, the quality of the film is Ghibli-worthy, and Makoto-Shinkai-worthy. It is a BEAUTIFUL film with plenty of allusions to flight that you can't miss Miyazaki's love for air craft here. We get to see both views of the heroes and wonder just who is really Inverted?

If you like Ghibli, Makoto-Shinkai, action, adventure, some cute subtle hints of romance, and a world you really want to visit, I have to point you to this amazing film. Just SUPERB!!!!",1414713600,121,1537,4.561594202898551

1896997,4,B00009Y3P8,Fascinating concept and sweet 'Romeo & Juliet' overtone. Agree with other reviewers that there is a lot of untapped potential in a gravity shifting space from an animation and story telling perspective but this movie was great and it was digestible enough that my 7 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed it as well.,1511136000,,314,4.943396226415095

1897011,5,B00009Y3P8,"This was a fantastic surprise!  This is a wonderful piece of science fiction that we really enjoyed; so much so that we went back and purchased it.  For context: we have only purchased 3 movies in our 5 years together.

Unlike a huge amount of anime, the excitement, suspense, and interest does not come from prolific amounts of gore.  I don't think a single drop of blood was shown in this work.  The story line is great and it is well executed.  We talked about it for a good while when it was over and have discussed it at least once each day in the last 3 since watching it.

Definitely worth a watch.",1497052800,,605,4.254385964912281
1897012,4,B00009Y3P8,"I liked this movie! It's basically about tolerance and acceptance of other people. However, it is masked in a manner so that it is not as simple as the color of someone's skin or the manner in which he/she speaks. The movie teaches social acceptance without bashing you over the head with the ideal. The plot, animation, voices, and story line were all excellent and kept my interest until the end.",1496188800,2,398,4.619718309859155

Good voice acting; although I guess those who saw in in Japanese don't care for the English voice over, it didn't bother us. We loved the stories and the characters. Very glad this came up as a suggestion. We rented it on Amazon with the English voice over and will probably buy the Japanese version with English subtitles.",1488240000,,417,4.5
1897022,5,B00009Y3P8,"Not sure why people are saying it's hard to follow. My brother and I watched it for the first time last night, and we figured it all out by the end. Sure, it's trippy, but it's not impossible to understand with some logical reasoning. I also watched the dubbed version. It really wasn't that bad. My only complaint is the main antagonist is admittedly rather weak, but hey, the fact that Potema can literally fall into the sky adds drama of its own. It's not the best anime movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty darn good, and I found Potema to be adorable.",1487721600,,557,4.365384615384615

1897038,2,B00009Y3P8,"I  won't spoil  it, but I got extremely bored with the pacing from the start. I struggled to make it though the end, restarting the movie a couple of times.

Others will probably like it. It's the standard rescue the princess tale. A lot of people will like that. I figured out the plot twists very early in the story so the ending was ultimately very predicable to me.

I've seen the other reviews about how well the animation is done. I didn't see it that way. It's fine, but nothing spectacular. May be it's just me, but I found the worlds to be rather boring. I tend to think, it was intended as such for an Orwellian feel. I just don't think the art style hit the right mood. I never felt scared of the villains. Maybe it was the English dub voice acting that was to blame, but I never felt that character interactions ever went anywhere. Pretty compelling to me.",1486339200,,868,4.306748466257669

The surface people live in a totalitarian society that regards the people underground as sinners who destroyed their world with a gravitational experiment gone awry.  The leader of this society sees Patema and her people as a threat that needs to be destroyed.

Nope. The paper cover was in perfect shape, and so we're the contents. I was very pleased with the shiny quality of the product ^ ^

However, I have seen the film Upside Down starring Kirsten Dunst years before seeing this film. After little research, it appears these films came out about the same time. So I cannot say that one film ""copied"" the other. I am curious, and unaware, if this has been a story (book, graphic novel) or a film plot prior to either of these films being released. That being said, this film had little extra to offer, in a sense of my awareness or being thought provoking. They are nearly identical films.  I read other reviews before watching Patema Inverted, and can confidently say that if you have seen Upside Down, this film offers nothing more than being wonderfully animated with great cinematography shots (if that's what you call it in animated films).  There are no twists or surprises. It is literally an animated, Japanese version of Upside Down. However, if you have not seen Upside Down, you will most truly enjoy this treasure. Having seen Upside Down prior, I still was able to enjoy the animated mastery of this film.",1485302400,,1112,4.697435897435898

Wow, that was something. I first found out about this movie a while back while browsing on Amazon, didn't really think anything of it, was watching other anime movies and series and didn't really think this was that interesting so I just let this movie sit. I was able to watch the movie today and well that was an experience I was not expecting.
I generally don't say this a lot with movies, as it can be difficult finding the really good ones from the ones that are good in certain areas but lack over here or there where you really want more work from those making the movie, but with this movie I honestly can say you get to experience consistently wondering what will happen next, trying to understand everything. In the beginning I was just like, I'm not sure I understand the whole upside down concept but I'll go along with it, and then you get to the world where you meet the main male lead of this story, and you begin to think, ""ok, I think I've got some of what's happening down, I think I'm beginning to understand the mechanics of these two separate worlds."" Well, that gets shattered to pieces as you hit one of the climaxes and you think again that maybe you were wrong and this is how the world works. Well...get to the end and oh look more revealing. In other words I can almost guarantee anyone watching this for the first time will not be able to figure out everything.
This is perfect for someone who thinks they can figure just about any movie or series out by now. Having seen a ton of stuff a lot of the elements that happen in movies have started to become predictable at times. Even if the movies really good, we still knew what would happen, but not with this movie, this will make your head spin and keep reminding you to just sit back, watch, and figure it out as it goes.
Awesome movie, continuously suspenseful, absolutely amazing and fascinating. I'm willing to bet Spock the Vulcan himself would get a kick out of this.
To those who have seen this movie do not spoil it for those new to this, or those you introduce to the movie. And to those of you who have not watched this movie before enjoy!! :)",1485302400,,2236,4.3621103117506

Though it is only hinted at until they actually meet, Age and Patema have opposite gravity, coming from people with opposite gravity, which provides for some wonderfully different perspectives on everything and requires them to rather quickly learn to trust each other in the face of opposition on both sides.

So why only 4 stars?  Because once all the mysteries are unraveled, only the most appalling stupidity remains, a stupidity so gargantuan that it all but justifies the actions of the most twisted villain, who arguably acted the way he did because the people who knew better never bothered to try and tell him (or anyone else) any different!

A story about two kids growing up in a world they don't understand, and their perspectives on their own lives are (literally) flipped upside down when they discover there's more to life than they had initially known.

I'm not going to give a summary of the story because I recommend you watch it for yourself.

The sound, music, and art all come together beautifully and make this movie really burst with emotion.

The characters were all surprisingly realistic and easy to relate to for being anime. When they talk about their lives, their memories, their dreams, you truly feel for them. Every character has a unique personality that feels real.

This movie teaches you that even though our world might be completely inverted to the one that other people have, we're still all people in the end.",1480636800,,908,4.614906832298137

1897166,3,B00009Y3P8,"It was a fun movie... the physics of it weren't completely thought through, though.  The acceleration of two masses with opposite gravity would be proportional to the ratio of net weight to total mass, i.e. with a 150 lbm person and a 130 lbm person, the acceleration would be 32*20/280= 2.3 ft/s^2 neglecting aerodynamic drag.  That would possibly work out OK for the scene where they leaped off the cliff together, but the impact would have been painful.  However, falling upward through the air for hours, they would have continued to accelerate towards terminal velocity, which is 120ish mph in a skydiving position, or more like 800 mph in the more streamlined position they assumed and presumably thinner atmosphere at that altitude.  They could have made it all plausible by drawing the inverted character to be heavier, and the lighter one would have had to carry a backpack or something to keep them on the ground.  The backpack could then have been released after the halfway point, whereupon the pair would have begun decelerating and reached a reasonable velocity by the time they landed on the structure in the sky, and hopefully grabbed onto something.  Nice artistic values though, it was worth watching overall.",1477958400,,1227,4.990196078431373

1897177,4,B00009Y3P8,"This was a charming sci-fi movie about two people from what seem to at first be vastly different backgrounds coming to a unique understanding and basically falling for each other. In many sense of the word.

While the villain was pretty standard, very stereotypical religious fanatic bent on destroying outsiders to his sect, the world and premise behind the movie were the real stars of the show. You could really tell that the creators had this interesting premise in mind and kind of cobbled together a last minute villain to forward the plot and provide a measure of tension.

Other than that, however, the characters were likable and the premise behind the movie, different people experiencing gravitational forces that are directly opposite to each other, was really fascinating and the ""camera"" angles and art direction very well conveyed the dizzying sense of being suspended over an infinite drop into the sky. This could have easily been worth five starts had it explored a different approach to the conflict of the story, perhaps focusing solely on the relationship between the two main characters and the unique struggles they would have to face trying to love each other from different worlds.",1476921600,,1206,5.055276381909548

1897191,3,B00009Y3P8,"This movie is based on an intriguing concept: an experiment gone awry causes gravity to reverse... for half the population. These people, called ""inverts"", now live in tunnels, and their trips to the surface are filled with fear of falling into the sky. The remaining population preaches that inversion is a punishment for sinners, and live in an authoritarian society with their eyes fixed safely on the ground. As the movie progresses, the characters learn more about their world, and the lines between ""right side up"" and ""upside down"" are increasingly blurred.

It's a brilliant concept, with beautiful, light-filled art to match. The characters, unfortunately, are flatter than the art. The male main character, Age, chafes against his authoritarian society. How did that work out for him before the invert Patema fell into his life? Was he a hacker, a rebel, or just a hopeless dreamer? We never find out. The other character's backstories are even thinner.

This movie came so close to being wonderful. I want to see this world done again, and done better. I want to play a video game where I can explore and watch gravity - and my perspective - flip from right-way-up to upside-down and back again.",1475366400,8,1206,4.935960591133005

1897259,4,B00009Y3P8,"The movie's premise is a bit peculiar but as an allegory for racism and other prejudice it sends a nice message (perhaps particularly this year). It's an interesting story of a society of survivors who has labeled themselves as the moral authority after some ""other people"" made a mess of things. They take this position to extremes,controlling and training their populace to follow their dogma.  As dark as that sounds, the story telling doesn't dwell on it.  For those wondering if it's good for kids:  It's got a few moment in it when someone threatens another with a gun and other moments when the hero and heroine are in real mortal danger, but none of these last very long.  There's an allusion to a death that could be troubling to younger kids--if they comprehend it--but, since they don't actually show the body in full it may be missed. In the dialogue I don't think any of the characters actually even say that he's dead.  Besides that, there is a lot of blustering dialogue from the bad guys--the main one coming off as a complete loon, and maybe a perv--but the protagonists balance this out nicely.  There's enough action and just weirdness of the story to keep the whole family entertained, and again there's this message of inclusion and labeling of the other that could be a good discussion to have with the kids.

Spoiler Alert:

At the end of the movie it's revealed that the ones who were assumed to be the ""sinners' are actually the ones who are the ""right way up"" after all.  The world the antagonist's lived in was fake and the real world was in effect below them all along..or above them, but still below because they're upside down.",1469491200,2,1657,4.6279863481228665

1897273,5,B00009Y3P8,"Patema Inverted is an excellent realistically detailed animated movie. It's like sci-fi meets anime, in a world where every point of view is in some sense inverted from what you might initially expect, and it's hard to tell which ways of looking at things are more familiar and which ways are more alien. I've wondered for many years when I would see a movie that explored something along these lines. Would love to see this become a bit of a trend. :)",1468800000,,452,4.524390243902439

This anime made you kinda think, ""Am I the right side or the wrong side?""  Of course it's about a boy and a girl who are literally from opposite ends of a world that believes they are the ""right side up.""  These two kids find eachother, hide eachother, and learn about eachother and over come the fear of the ""others.""",1468713600,,448,4.426829268292683

The only critique is I wish there had been more backstory about what caused the world to be like this. I know ""what"" caused it but I wish I knew exactly what happened and when. Also the main villain and his understanding of the other world was difficult to comprehend.

It has an interesting premise, but the pacing is a bit too plodding, and the characters never bubble with enough chemistry for viewers to build much of an attachment to, dulling any emotional punches. The villain is also pretty weak, and the ending is pretty clumsy. Visuals and character design are nice (and the flipping camera is effectively disorienting for the changes in gravitational orientation), and there's nothing really objectionable for family viewing, but overall it falls pretty flat as an experience.",1465084800,,539,5.352941176470588

The main concept of the film is also a really cool concept. Unfortunately, it isn't executed so perfectly. The characters seem kind of two-dimensional, no pun intended, and the villain is nothing more than a cackling evangelical wacko obsessed with law and order, and has no real identifiable characteristics whatsoever. Also, some of the big twists in the film are never explained. I'd say that if you can watch it on Prime for free, you might as well because of the really cool moments of interesting animation, and it's not the worst way to spend 90 minutes, but if you're expecting to identify with any of the characters or understand the world and the plot past the halfway mark, you'll be disappointed.",1464048000,,884,4.822368421052632

Most significantly, we ended up watching it on Hulu, because Amazon complained that we did not have the right set up for HD. We do, and so we watched it in HD on Hulu. I don't know why Amazon's site does this to us all the time. The only other thing I would complain about directly related to the movie was that a subtitled version (with original language track) was not available (on either site), and the dub was not so good. The main character, Patema had a voice that was way too high pitched and expressionless and was most annoying. One or two other characters' voices were also pretty grim. It's annoying when American voice actors try to imitate the pitch & cadence of Japanese (especially the female voice). It's awful. Give it up already.",1463961600,3,828,4.383116883116883

1897377,5,B00009Y3P8,"What I enjoyed most about this anime was that the female character wasn't all super girly and helpless. The story was unique and was told well.

I absolutely did not expect the ending although I do wish it could have had more closure.  But that is one thing that makes anime stories differ from the rest.

The story takes place on Earth I believe 100 years after some man made disaster and there are two distinct types of humans that have ""evolved""  and now exist together on the  recovering earth.

One of these humans accidentally comes to the other humans habitat and set off a chain of events that change both groups.

Again, a great original story.  If you are a fan of anime, particularly apocalyptic stories then this is one flick to add to your anime collection. It is slow at times but not in a way that will make you not want to finish watching. Definitely a must for anime Otakus.",1463097600,3,891,4.423312883435583

But no, lets just hug the whole time cause it's cute.

The ""story"" has one point to it and the writers try so hard to make a mystery of it. That they miss out on telling any real story at all.
I gave this two stars for the good looking animation. Too bad it was wasted.

I literally had to send them the link to where it says that my setup is supported. After going in circles for 20 minutes, I asked to speak with her supervisor.

Enjoy the reveal at the end, and watching again with perhaps a new perspective.

1897471,4,B00009Y3P8,"I thought this was pretty darn interesting and I liked it because it didn't try to get too scientific, it uses the theme of two different cultures meeting, but in a very interesting way. The bad guy is a little too stereotypical, but the other characters are more interesting. The art isn't terrific, but good enough to carry the plot and I did like the clothing fashion design. It must be hard to do upside down clothing. This plot doesn't push romance or have cute sidekicks, but it's good for adults and kids of all ages. It could lead to good family discussions about gravity, meeting people unlike you, following the rules. It sure puts meaning into the term ""turning the world upside down""!
Definitely worth a rental, but maybe not part of my permanent collection.",1457222400,,770,4.669117647058823

Annoying character voices, thin dialog, confused representation of physics (aside from the element that is supposed to be reversed, of course), and an end that can't come soon enough, led me to a 1 star review.

1897531,4,B00009Y3P8,"Cute story.  I thought the writing and voice acting was pretty well done.  The story was very well put together in my opinion.  I was never really sold as to why the leader of the ""nazi"" world was so hell bent on the destruction of the Inverted.  All I could think of was the incredible wealth that could come out of it.  Greed was not his driving passion.  It seemed he was trying to hide something that he himself didn't really know.  You'll have to watch the movie to understand what I mean.  Basically the story is about a scientific accident that destroys civilization that results with two groups of people.  Each consider the other the inverted.  They're inverted because gravity affects them reversely and one group would be repelled out into space.  The adventure is about a forbidden friendship between a boy and a girl from each group both with a think outside the box mentality.  How will they survive the gravity twists and the hunt from the dictator leader with his police state?",1455580800,,993,4.611428571428571

I was browsing around to see if there were any hidden gems. Movies like summer wars don't make as much buzz as popular animes but definitely worth watching for example.

1897603,3,B00009Y3P8,"A unique story and entertaining to watch. Some obvious science-based challenges for realism, but overall I enjoyed it. I think the style of the animation is really the standout feature of the film. Very clean cut and beautiful with some great little effects here and there for eye candy. The plot is a bit familiar - two opposing societies, each thinks the other is evil, boy and girl romance plot isn't too heavy which is a nice change of pace, one society justifies it's actions with religion. So on and so forth.",1453939200,,515,4.608695652173913

It is a bit slow but other than the music and the actual quality of the animation I don't believe there is anything really ground breaking about it. The characters are cute but listless and aren't much different than those you've seen in many other anime's. It's a little cliche at its depth although the story line is unique.,1452124800,,466,4.430232558139535
1897658,5,B00009Y3P8,I haven't yet watched it. But based off of the description it's an animated version of the acted movie Upside Down which is a beautiful awesome movie which I recommend to everyone. It's on Netflix by the way.,1452038400,,208,4.5

1897669,5,B00009Y3P8,"Was a great watch for an Amazon Prime movie, but I probably would not have gone out of my way to purchase this movie off of the shelf.  There was some confusion about the exact physics behind the animations, granted I understand that it is a work of pure fantasy.  My only complaint is this, temperature.  This single variable when briefly presented with it in the movie really threw me for a curve ball and I thought I was just beginning to get the whole ""inverted"" thing.  It was really well presented, beautiful artwork in the scenery/animations and a bit more detail given to a historical background behind the exact situation that the characters were in.  This may have created a lack of real character development over the course of the story, but I enjoyed the possibilities that it presented and was left with a feeling of wanting to know more about that crazy environment.  The variability of perspective is something that is clearly stressed in this film and is worth appreciating in the long run.",1450396800,,1007,4.693181818181818

1897689,4,B00009Y3P8,"This is a beautiful movie, and the premise is super cool. I liked that the backstory was given to us sparingly and that we were allowed to experience the movie through the two main characters' point of view, which led to the cool camera shifting. I thought Patema and Age's devotion to one another was touching and I liked the creative use of their weight/counterbalancing to fly. Very cool.

It did have a few shortcomings. Age's personality was pretty bland. I guess most of the people's on Aiga were, so maybe that was intentional. His lines, and some of the main antagonist's were REALLY BAD. I kept thinking looking for original Japanese or something but it looks like it was recorded in English. I'm pretty forgiving most of the time, but the ones like this from the Elder"" You're too upside down to understand."" UM WHAT?? I totally laughed out loud.
Also ****SPOILERS**** I guess the premise is wild to begin with, but it also gave you some ideas that could be hard to swallow. The part where objects from the respective places retained their original gravity even in the opposite place? Weird. That made the flying machine kind of nonsensical to me. The tunnel from Aiga to the underground where Patema lived went even farther down and then....came out the other side? And it was inverted? I was going, ""is this the other side of the Earth? What happened to like the molten core? Hmm...okay..."" The ending didn't quite wrap everything up as nicely as I would've liked either. I mean, Age can't really live with Patema forever, because if she lets go he will FALL INTO THE SKY AND DIE. Which is, by the way, a metal thing with lights that is completely unexplained. Don't get it.

So lovely movie, KILLER PREMISE, just some storytelling things I didn't quite get. I love ambitious ideas and projects, so I rated it slightly higher than I felt the storytelling deserved. We need more crazy things like this getting made.",1449446400,,1926,4.678466076696165

I've watched GitS, Black Magic M-66, Patlabor, Dragonball and DBZ, Paprika, Roujin Z, Vampire Hunter D, Dark City, Akira and all of Ohayo Miyaziki's films dozens of times, over and over.  I've only watched this one once.  And I don't feel the need to watch it again.  I don't dislike it.  If I did, I'd give it one-star.  It's just not that interesting to me compared to other anime.

I'm much more of a subtitle person, rather than dubbed, so I can't help but wonder if there was something lost in translation. I also was fairly annoyed when the background sounds were much, much louder than the voice over (which meant that I still had to turn subtitles on to understand what they were saying or be blasted with sound every few minutes).

1897768,5,B00009Y3P8,"A clever plot that intrigues and leave you wanting more. Patema Inverted is the most original movie I have seen in recent memory. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie not just because of different plot, but because I got into the two main characters and the relationship they developed despite the laws of physics (or lack there of.....???) working against them. The villain in this movie is easy to hate, leaving you to really want to see the main characters succeed. The story leaves you wondering which way is up and which way is down. The movie is also very thought invoking. It shows how fear of the unknown and trying to explain a cataclysmic event through invented religious beliefs can lead to unfounded, blind discrimination, crippling societal regulations, and, in the case of the villain, absolute insanity. It also makes you think to yourself, ""If you have any fear of falling to earth from any great distance, imagine how you would feel if you fell UP (shout out to Shel Silverstein) and off the earth......that instead of hard ground, you would fall toward the vast emptiness of space........Now imagine if the only thing that keeps you from falling UP is bear-hugging a person who weighs a little more than you that falls DOWN and is perfectly content with using your anti-gravity characteristics as a means to 'fly'..........Wow! This movie is $%#@! awesome!"" All of this from a movie that is only an hour and forty minutes long.....my hat is off to creators of this movie. Patema Inverted is original, thrilling, and thought invoking. Add to that an enticing friendship/romance between the two main characters and great animation, and you are left with a movie that I feel can be summed up in one word: ""FANTASTIC""! I strongly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies that makes you think with a dash of romance. ALSO, this movie is very re-watchable as I found myself rewinding the movie to watch certain scenes and each time I discovered a hidden detail that I had missed in my prior viewing.",1445126400,,2017,4.815561959654179
1897779,5,B00009Y3P8,"Wow.  Just wow.  I loved it.

The experience of the inversion and re-inversion was completely unsettling, and the fear that you could feel with the characters was undeniable.  The end was mind-bending.  I have to say, now many minutes after the film is over, I am still visually disoriented.  It's awesome.

There's no need to go into the ""moral of the story.""  Just enjoy it for itself.  If you enjoy ""intelligent"" anime, you're in for a treat.

While the story is confusing, and you will, more than likely, be left clueless after your first watch, the story and characters have a way of pulling you into their situation, and you really root for them!

1897822,5,B00009Y3P8,"Patema Inverted caught my interest after I had seen director Yasuhiro Yoshiura's previous work Time of Eve and just like that film, I enjoyed it Immensely. I have grown to like Yoshiura's style of story telling in which he tells high concept sci-fi while making it still easy to consume for a general viewer but does this without dumbing things down. Patema Inverted might feel a bit familiar to fans of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki or the amazing Mamoru Hosoda, in the sense that it's the very traditional story of ""boy meets girl"" and then they proceed to go on a adventure together  but I think it's still worth checking out for anime and movie fans in general. Yoshiura's style of directing and heavy focus on sci-fi gives the film a nice sense of uniqueness that's different than the two previously mentioned directors and overall gives an entertaining and somehow old school feeling movie. How the director creates a feeling of suspense and awe when playing twister with gravity is exhilarating and fun to watch and thankfully some solid character work makes the film a little more then just eye candy. Admittedly their are few issues with the film in that the dialogue can be a bit dry at certain parts, the villain feels a little too been their done that and the animation while great can be a little stale in some scenes but I felt these were far from deal breakers and didn't hurt the overall film too much. In the end if you want some good quality escapism, Patema Inverted should fit the bill nicely.",1441929600,,1512,4.641791044776119

1897895,4,B00009Y3P8,"A scientific experiment to harness the energy of gravitational fields for more...practical uses has failed, resulting in thousands of people having their gravitational centres reversed. After this incident, the 'Inverts' have to live their lives...upside down, underground, away from the surface world, where a Nazi-esque society have forbidden all human desires and expressions of imagination, desire for inventions and even looking up into the sky...supposedly to avoid such a disaster again.

Naturally, a story LOOSELY based on the tried Romeo and Juliet plotline ensued...Patema, an 'Invert' (what the film refers to the upside down dwellers) girl, was inspired by her guardian to find and explore the 'true world'. Her adventures leads her to meet Age, a 'normal' boy, who is born with a knack for breaking rules and laws...basically a pain in the backside for his tightly controlled society. ANNNDDD of course, both sides have...less than impressed reactions to this relationship.

DON'T let this get you down, I am not giving away too much plotlines to avoid spoilers, but if even this promise doesn't please you, the visuals will.
The unique style of this anime film is NOT its landscape designs, nor its character designs, nor even animation...all those are top-notch, vibrant and stunning to look at. However, 'perspective' is the master stroke that this film successfully employs. Just imagine...you have two main characters who have their own views of the world...and both consider each other's viewpoints to be 'upside down', the film constantly flips perspectives (literally by simply turning the image upside down). You MIGHT find Patema's fear of the sky to be childish, but within a few seconds of you merely THINKING about making fun of her in your mind, the camera flips and you find yourself gasping at the endless chasm that is the sky, as Patema would see it: Its basically our version of jumping off a cliff or airplane...WITHOUT a parachute.

The gist of the story seems simple enough: humans are incapable of supressing their curiosity. However, as you dig deeper, you uncover an even more BEAUTIFUL message. Both main characters are held back by their own worldsboth of them subject to education that forces upon them discrimination against the other 'opposing' society and BOTH of them are unsatisfied with their own worlds. When Patema and Age hold on to each other, their gravities cancel each other outallowing them to LITERALLY FLY! Message? Acceptance and understanding is the key to progress. I find this message to be hidden in plain sight in the film, and its a wonderful one at that!

Of course, the flaws are somewhat obvious, too. The film is too short to flesh out the side characters, the lore can be a bit more in depth, and the villain is a bit generic...I feel, that a 120 minute runtime would elevate this film to another level, hell a full 24-6 episode series would have been legendary to say the least. BUT, I cannot recommend this film ENOUGH, if Studio Ghibli can match or OUTmatch this film, I'm in for a GREAT marathon, once my blu-rays arrive.

The soundtrack? Holy...Michiru 'shima (mind you, she's the composer who composed for Fullmetal Alchemist as well...RESPECT her) must've listened to some Wagner and said to herself 'I want every orchestral CUE to end with a Wagner-sized BANG'. Basically...she got herself a bigass orchestra and...let them do their thing. The orchestrations may not be John Williams-level, nor did the film REALLY needed it...It's a glorious cross between Goldsmith/Horner Star Trek, Horner's unrestrained passionate melodies and John Barry lyricism (at least...that's how I perceive the sound coming out of that orchestra).",1437696000,,3703,5.134328358208955

1897945,5,B00009Y3P8,"Just finished watching ""Patema Inverted"" released by Cinedigmenentertainment.
""Patema Inverted"" is a delightful coming-of-age story with lush animation that almost rivals and sometimes surpasses Studio Gibli.
""Patema Inverted"" is an allegory of a the future of a world and humanity divided by an ancient scientific experiment to control the forces of gravity that had gone horribly wrong.  Humanity is divided between two types of people - those who have their feet firmly planted on the surface of the world and Inverts - people who live in a jumbled underground world where they live normal, hidden lives.  If an Invert accidentally or deliberately goes to the surface world they risk flying upside down upward into the sky of the surface world.
Surface dwellers are taught that looking up into the sky is bad and that all Inverts are sinners.
 Patema is an an Invert and a ""princess"" of the underground world.  She longs to break free of the rules and boundaries placed upon her and explore the worlds beyond.  She is inspired in part by an older friend who she has a crush on and is aware that he doesn't love her.  He has disappeared while exploring the world above, so Patema decides that she is going to search for him.
Meanwhile Age is a surface dweller who longs for the sky and his father who was killed by attempting to fly in an anti-gravity device. Circumstances bring Patema and Age together and they form a bond while trying to return Patema back to the underground world.  Unfortunately, the religious zealot who rules the surface world wants to extinguish all Inverts because they represent evil.
""Patema Inverted"" is a spellbinding story that entwines the fate of four people - two told in a journal - who are not at ease in their worlds and long to explore the worlds beyond their reach.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

I feel like there is an incredible story here, but some areas of the cultures and environments were either left underdeveloped or were super complex and rushed through. There are also some parts of the story that don't quite make sense when you poke them.

1897980,3,B00009Y3P8,"The great thing about anime is that it can tell a science fiction story just as easily as a story with no fantasy elements... quite the opposite from a live-action movie where the idea of reversed-gravity characters would be very difficult to produce convincingly.

Also this movie has great animation.

Otherwise there's not much new in this anime, boy meets girl and must fight the evil empire headed by Darth Vader. Yawn. Also the basic premise has some nagging details about the mechanics... like if reversed-gravity food and water would eventually make turn someone into a normal person in a long enough timespan.",1431993600,,618,4.990291262135922

I won't give away the story.  But like in the movie ""Upside Down"" it gives you an enjoyable but uneasy feeling when the two main characters are holding onto each other for dear life.  The cover art gives you an ideas of what to expect.  The animation is quite good and the pacing is good for a Japanese movie.

1897987,2,B00009Y3P8,"This review focuses on the blu-ray.  This is not a review of the quality of the film itself, which I rate highly.  The disc I received prevented subtitle switching, both from the remote and from the menus.  Subtitles are stuck on one of the subtitle tracks and cannot be disabled.  I have purchased three of these discs now, returning the first two, and all three had the same issue.  I tested these on four different blu-ray players, including different brands, and the issue was present on all of them.

I contacted the blu-ray producers (G-Kids), who confirmed that this is a manufacturing (disc authoring) defect, and I've been waiting patiently hoping that they will correct the issue and send me a replacement that fixes the defect; their representative says that their tech department is still researching the issue, but after several months, they have yet to fix it.

If you prefer watching anime with subtitles, this may not be an issue for you.  Unfortunately, if you prefer to watch dubs with subtitles that only translate the writing (signs, etc.) in the film, or subtitles in a different language, or no subtitles at all, you'll be out of luck until the defect is fixed and an updated blu-ray disc is released.",1431475200,3,1223,4.79047619047619

I would recommend this movie to anyone who like the other movies mentioned above.  Just be warned the detail in the cartooning is not as some of the others, but it has a really great message about prejudice and hating people who are different.  Also having the courage to try things that  scare you and standing up for those who may be different than yourselves.  You can also take political messages form this moving about the value the freedoms we hold so dear and never letting them be taken from us and what can happen when a dictator takes our freedoms all in the name of protection.",1430438400,,752,4.5

The whole inverted gravity concept is one of the most innovative idea I've ever seen. I'm not gonna spoil the story too much here, but I love the relationship between Age and Patema. Nothing wrong with that innocent love and romance. It's proof that you don't need tons of perverse humor and overly big boobs to make an outstanding movie!

I actually had to look up this movie on IMDB to find out if it was done by Studio Ghibli. It's not, but it's got a lot of the whimsy, creativity, and polish that makes Miyazaki's work stand out so much!

The only thing keeping me from giving a full 5-stars is that the English voice-work is not as good as it should have been. Unfortunately, I didn't find an option to watch it in Japanese on Amazon Prime Streaming.

1898105,5,B00009Y3P8,"I absolutely loved this film! The idea is that there are people with an opposite gravity from us, they live under ground so that they won't float away. Patema is a young adventures girl who accidentally makes it to the surface world. Age is a school boy who finds her and helps her by taking her indoors where she won't float away. But up on the surface world everyone is told that people with inverted gravity are all sinners, and that looking at the sky is a sin. Age loves the sky and by holding on to Patema, they cancel out each other's weight and can fly.

I really love this movie, the visuals are stunning. The scenery in this films are amazing and beautiful. I love the watercolor style of this art and it never fails to leave me breathless. The voice overs are also really good, matching the voice and character perfectly. I highly recommend this movie, if only to see something beautiful.",1427673600,,899,4.448484848484848

1898108,5,B00009Y3P8,"I had seen some ""Anime"" years ago and didn't like it, so I didn't give any other Anime movie a chance, but today, two friends recommended this movie to me, the trailer looked interesting, so I watched it and loved it.

Just like the Star Trek episode showing racism between people black on the left side and white on the right was an excellent commentary about this problem that still pervades our society, this movie uses two groups of related humanity, one for whom gravity draws people toward the center of the world, and the other for whom gravity pulls them outward toward the stars.

There is a lot of animosity with some of the old timers who try to keep the opposite group secret from the young people, but the young people still manage to learn about the others, and to learn more about each other.

This is an excellent movie. Even if you think you hate Anime, it is still an excellent movie with an excellent story and a great plot.

I highly recommend Patema Inverted. I didn't even realize that the English language soundtrack might have been the second language, it was that good.

I might add that this movie reminded me a little bit of the Star Trek Next Generation when they rescued Scotty from the hollow world. Can you imagine what that would would have been like if people lived on both sides of that hollow shell. It might make an interesting movie for a future Star Trek reboot.

1898158,5,B00009Y3P8,"I love anime a lot that I end up purchasing the official releases from Japan for the texture, extra goods and packaging that's put together with a special art box. I own the official limited edition release from Japan, it's twice the size of the Western counterpart and packs a lot of goods. Though the price is twice of what we have here. Let's talk about the movie:

It's awesome. I love gravity, I love manipulations of gravity and physics. This movie doesn't lack anything about scientific weirdness which never explains itself properly because the main focus of the whole movie is the relationship of two groups, two society and civilization which was split apart from an error that occurred long ago in the movie. Regardless of such, the entertainment and value is striking awesome. The atmosphere, the feel of my feet clinging so low to the never-ending deep sky when Patema was holding on, ah I shivered nonetheless. Each part has its own twist, every five to ten minutes a new twist jumps in, or a new scene sparks out of no where. It's great to have and I recommend it even to kids. I've recommended it to some fellow co-workers and they liked it a lot.

And that, is that.

There's a lot of interesting twists as you go through the movie, and some i felt skeptical about, but even so it was an interesting idea. it's better when you forget about the laws of nature and just assume they are in an alternate universe. there's very little to complain about the plot, other than a few plot holes. i've noticed other people complained that it's a little slow, but i think it's the perfect amount of time; movies nowadays are kind of on the fast side and try to fit too much in within an hour an a half, and this slows down at parts to look at the beautiful images these people imagined up for us. in a way, it's similar to how wall-E slows down at the pretty parts. the only true criticism i have is that the characters aren't very dynamic. the dialogue they exchange at times is kind of dull. even so, the characters are still likable, and you find yourself rooting for them anyways, so it doesn't matter all that much.",1425254400,31,1064,4.272277227722772

1898164,5,B00009Y3P8,"By far the best written, paced and animated anime I've seen in several years. While Patema takes its time world building, developing character and telling the story it builds both mystery and suspense rapidly and carries the viewer though to a conclusion that is satisfying and touching. In fact Patema manages to be suspenseful in a way I never expected an animated film COULD be. Many fantasy and science fiction anime turn in endings so subtle you puzzle over the final scenes for weeks before ultimately consulting Wikipedia or just giving up. Patema in contrast sets up a mythology, builds a world and answers all your questions in solid and satisfying ways. Patema runs about twenty minutes longer than most anime features but it never drags or wanders into extended sidebars or meditative errata. This is a fun and though provoking film start to finish. I simply cannot recommend it enough.",1425168000,,897,4.947019867549669

1898187,5,B00009Y3P8,"I enjoyed this. Fantastic both in the sense that its an imaginative idea and that it resembles a fairy tale. I definitely think that is the proper approach to this story -nobody complains about the lack of character development or two dimensional dialogue in Cinderella or Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, because these types of stories are too ""distilled"" and ""pure"" in their intentions to convey simple emotions or morals to get muddled up in the complexities of reality. Perhaps the story here is a little more complex than that, but still, the characters are more or less part of the details, the minutiae, and the real focus is conveyed strongly in the cover pose and background.

This is a story about trust, plain and simple. To be fair, there is actually a decent number of aspects here, with this trust touching beauty, purity, naivety, ignorance, danger, desire, and zealotry, to name a few off the top of my head. However, there is enough dangling information that an active viewer could easily construct an entire world of messages and meanings, not to mention round out the fictional universe here pretty nicely.

Sure, despite the depth of this one thing, the story itself is spartan, barren, or even skeletal in many ways. However, for those who think deeply or will think about a movie even after the credits roll, this feels much more like a purposeful invitation than it does any type of failure. I personally appreciate such an approach -sort of the inverse of reading a book.

And in the same way, I think this is best viewed with your full attention -turn out the lights, get close, feel your feet dangling toward the empty, cloud filled abyss while you hold onto a living lifeline. That fear mixed with the yearning for that kind of trust makes this highly worthy even ignoring the fun flips, pretty animation, and amazing implications.",1424390400,3,1857,4.796875

Watching the movie for the first time you are wowed by the perspective change that comes with seeing the sky as something you can fall into and never come back. I watched it a second time about a month later to show it to someone who hadn't seen it before. It wasn't as fun for me the second time and actually felt kinda slow. What other reviews have said when criticizing the movie for lack of character development is mostly true, so it won't be a movie you keep coming back to over again. What it does have going for it is a unique universe and sci-fi plot twists. I still give it 5 stars because it was a perfect movie for me on my first view.

1898206,5,B00009Y3P8,"I love this movie. Pretty soon 2014 is going to be over and this feels like one of the top movies of the year for me. This is because the story is very unusual.  Its about two worlds where certain things are in reverse - both materially/physically and also in terms of the world of thought.

I want to comment more on the artistic aspects since a lot of reviewers here have done a much better job on the story and other aspects than I ever could.

The colors are wonderful. You get two contrasts - one of world filled with lighter colors, tones, shades, etc. and another of the same only a good bit darker. So its bright blues/green/yellows and yellows/oranges/browns.  I guess this is cel-shaded primarily but streaked with other sorts of stylization. The lighting is done very well. Quite often the lighting exhibits a soft ambient glow that is quite pleasant. The background scenery strongly contrasts with the characters, that is to say that the styles are different. However it works well. One has rough lines and the other very smooth lines. The music also quite nice. It evokes a sense of wonder. Wonderful movie. Intelligent movie.

A lot of people dismiss anime as some kind of slapstick cartoon with silly humor. If I can just get them to watch this, they would see that anime is quite thoughtful and quite often better than many real movies.

Artist's Aside: I must say this movie has given me a new appreciation for aquamarine. Its been fuschia for quite some time.

1898217,5,B00009Y3P8,"Patema Inverted is an anime perspective-twisting science-fiction adventure about two people separated by opposite gravities. Fourteen-year-old Patema lives in an underground world. Although she is a princess, she is held back by the rules imposed by the elders of her clan. One day she explores a forbidden zone and tumbles headlong into a void and out into the wide open world above the surface, a place with reversed physics where she could fall up into the sky and be lost forever.

Age is a student on this surface world and part of a society whose compliant population has been brainwashed against the sinners who fell into the sky. When he spies Patema hanging upside down from a tree, he pulls her down to safety, struggling to keep her earthbound as she grips on to him for dear life. Together they master the art of navigating competing gravitational forces and set out to discover the secret that keeps their worlds apart.

Director Yasuhiro Yoshiura moves the story along briskly while playing with perspective and composing several wildly imaginative images that address assorted possibilities of being at war with gravity.

Bonus extra on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary, interviews with the director, and interviews with the original Japanese voice cast.",1416787200,,1281,5.119617224880383

And oh wow, I do not regret it. Loved it!

but that's the only annoyance I had.",1416700800,,289,4.78
1898219,4,B00009Y3P8,"Patema Inverted is a kickstarter-funded movie directed by Yasuhiro Yoshiura, the director of Pale Cocoon and Time of Eve.

The movie follows Patema, a young woman living in an underground society. She enjoys exploring the ""forbidden zone,"" a place that hasn't been inhabited or explored due to the dangerous ""bat men"" that prowl the area. Despite warnings from her peers, she continues to explore and one day, of course, she runs into one of the ""bat men."" He chases her into a mineshaft and she falls... up?

Patema literally falls into a world where gravity is reversed and she faces the constant danger of falling into the sky. With the help of Eiji (or Age, depending on the translation), a young man living in this upside-down world, she has to make her way home, avoiding the fanatic, totalitarian government ruled by a man who believes it is his holy duty to eradicate the sinners who fell into the sky.

With such an interesting and eye-catching premise, it's no surprise that Patema Inverted is a joy to look at. Gorgeous animation with a Miyazaki flair and brilliant direction turn the familiar sky into a dangerous, unfamiliar void. The scenes where Patema and Eiji fly and fall together are equal parts gorgeous, exhilarating and terrifying. The feeling of breathlessness and wonder I felt during some scenes reminded me of when I watched Dreamwork's ""How to Train your Dragon"" in theaters for the first time. Don't be surprised if people wandering by stop to watch too.

Unfortunately, for such a unique premise, the characters are a fairly bland. Patema has no real goal or motivation for most of the movie and no defining characteristics. Eiji is only a reflection of his father, whose dream to fly defines Eiji's whole personality. The government is every George Orwellian dystopia you've ever seen or read, although with a religious twist to it and the villain is the worst offender with no backstory or character aside from simply ""He's EVIL.""

However, all of this never bothered me during the movie. While watching, I was worried for Patema and wanted her to be safe. I wanted Eiji to accomplish his dream. I was frightened of the villain and what he wanted to do. It was only when I sat down to write this review that I realized how bland the characters were. But that just tells you how good the rest of the film is. By the time these issues become apparent, the movie has already enthralled you. If the premise interests you at all, you'll absolutely enjoy this movie. If you're not that interested in it, don't feel the need to go out of your way to watch it.

All in all, Patema Inverted is a solid film with a great premise that manages to hold up bland characters and successfully gets the viewer invested in their story.",1416614400,70,2748,4.702702702702703

7994354,4,B00009Y3P8,"Patema Inverted is a film about a split world where gravity points in different directions. This affects people, objects, and even natural stone. Wherever an object was created decides which direction the object falls. Of course, without some kind of protection, objects and people can fall into the sky.

That's the concept. As a concept, it's incredibly interesting. The gripping moments, awesome actions scenes, and interesting animation sequences have limitless potential. This movie fills that potential and does a fantastic job of executing the concept in a way that keeps things interesting.

Unfortunately, that's one of the only things the movie did exceedingly well. The pacing of the movie was strange. It started rather slowly until some revelations by the characters drew us into the action. The film takes a large amount of time to introduce us to Patema, one of our protagonists. While this is a good thing, Patema isn't an incredibly interesting character. She's the Chief's daughter, sure, but that only comes into play for a few lines of dialogue. She has some really emotional scenes that just don't feel as emotional as they should because the character depth isn't quite up to snuff.

In addition, Age, the other protagonist, doesn't get the same treatment Patema does, at least not right away. Until later in the movie, the only things we really know about Age is that he isn't happy with the authoritarian nature of his school/government.

The antagonist of the movie and the rest of the supporting cast are all extremely one-sided: dumb, in love, mindless goons, etc.

While the pacing is inconsistent and the movie starts off slow, once it hits its pace, it really takes off. The two protagonists really help develop each other, although the short amount of time it takes for each one to be willing to sacrifice their lives for the other is much too short.

Altogether, the plot is a means to an end. It is designed to force the characters together so their one-sided-ness isn't nearly as glaring as well as to give us a reason to see the world. The twist at the end wasn't terribly surprising, but it was executed well.

All in all, the movie was good, not great. The concept was fantastic, but the rest of the movie just held the concept back. It's certainly worth a watch (probably two), but it isn't something I'll make a point to watch at least once a year.",1517961600,,2387,4.821515892420538
