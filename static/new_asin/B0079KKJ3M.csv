5067581,5,B0079KKJ3M,I want to buy the soundtrak of this movie too. Is it available? I didn't find it. If is possible in CD. Thanks,1366502400,,110,3.8260869565217392
5067582,3,B0079KKJ3M,"Before Olivia Newton-John was known, she was part of a group called Toomorrow that made a movie by the same name. It was a disastrous flop, but I actually like it better than Two of a Kind. It will, however, never measure up to Grease. The story is better than in Xanadu, but the music in Xanadu is a lot better. The group gets abducted into an Alphoid spacecraft because of the vibes in their music, but they are returned to Earth as they can't produce these vibes in space, away from Earth. Later, however, their entire concert arena is beamed into Space. I'm glad that it finally got issued on DVD, but the DVD itself didn't live up to my expectations.  The quality is rather poor with some bits of footage lost here and there, and there's sound in only one channel. I would have preferred two-channel mono. Nevertheless, it does have some nostalgic value as it depicts some of the styles and general atmosphere at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s.",1351468800,,966,4.4576271186440675
5067583,1,B0079KKJ3M,"Sorry to say this, but the DVD is NOT DVD quality.  Far from it. At least the price was low.",1334448000,,92,3.6
5067584,3,B0079KKJ3M,"Back in the mid 70s when I discovered Olivia Newton-John, I had no idea she'd done the movie Toomorrow. Over the next few years, she'd refer briefly to the 'terrible' film that had been released in 1970, prefering to concentrate on talking about terrible films she was currently making. Such as Xanadu and Two Of A Kind! It was understandable that given Olivia's huge US success she'd rather the movie just slip away from public consciousness, but was Toomorrow really that bad?

No, of course not. It's not great, for sure, but is bright and peppy and the cast are young and attractive, especially ONJ who is noticably spunkier here than she was to become down the line. The dialogue is awful and the 'group' often seem like they've just met for the first time due to the stilted talking patterns. The songs aren't great either but are pretty 60s-ish pop fluff with Olivia's vocals standing out. The plot is dreadful but so are a lot of movies but they don't get shunted into a vault for 40 years!

The making of and subsequent failure of Toomorrow at the box office would make for a fascinating documentary, but it isn't on this DVD. I doubt there ever will be one with producer Don Kirshner, writer and director Val Guest along with 2 of the group members all dead. But this is the least of this DVD's troubles...

I'd previously only seen the Japanese subtitled VHS copy which was largely unwatchable, so it saddens me to say that this 2012 DVD version isn't much better. Actually, it's OK to begin with but as the film wears on the missed frames and picture freezes become more abundant. Indeed, the last 20 minutes are so bad I begin to wonder if I had a dud copy. It's a shame as the final number, one of the visual highlights, is all but ruined by the aforementioned problems.

There are no extras. There's barely a menu! So I can't really give the Toomorrow DVD anymore than three stars. If you don't own it I'd say get it but don't expect too much in terms of picture quality. Hopefully one day there'll be a better version available. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 40 years!",1333756800,3,2094,4.502631578947368
5067585,5,B0079KKJ3M,"I'm one of those rarest of individuals who actually enjoys this movie.  ""Toomorrow,"" with the two O's ""to make it more memorable,"" is quite humorous and it has a certain charm to it that original audiences might have missed when it first hit theaters in 1970.

The story centers around four university students--three guys and a gal--who have a band.  They've named their band ""Toomorrow.""  Their goal is to enter a popular and prestigious music contest.  What makes their band unique is their particular sound.  One of the members plays a rudimentary synthesizer that he created himself.  The sound vibrations it makes are genuinely cosmic.

So cosmic is the sound, it captures the attention of an alien race living in a galaxy far, far away.  The aliens have been to earth before eons ago, leaving an agent behind to observe the development of humankind.  When the aliens travel across space to track the source of this strange cosmic vibration, they learn it is emanating from planet Earth.  They contact their secret alien agent, who is disguised as a man and living in a conservatory near the university.  After beaming the agent aboard their orbiting ship (special effects were created by the late John Stears, one of the geniuses responsible for bringing the FX of ""Star Wars"" to the screen), the aliens notify him that their race is slowly dying.  The cause of death is a lack of sensory stimulation.  The aliens goes on to explain that a strange new vibration detected on earth could very well save their race.  The agent is instructed to return to earth, discover the source of the sonic vibration, and capture it on tape so it can be examined.

Meanwhile, back on earth at the university, students have gathered at the main hall and plan on staging a sit-in in protest of professorial laziness.  The four band members spontaneously break out in song to entertain their classmates.  As the band is playing, the alien agent tracks their special vibration to the school.  There, the alien invites the group to rehearse at the conservatory.  Of course, the band graciously accepts the invitation.  Once at the conservatory, the band breaks out in song and the alien records their cosmic vibrations.

Back on the spaceship, the aliens test the recording and confirm that the vibrations will indeed save their race from decline and death.  The aliens instruct the agent to talk the band into joining the aliens on a voyage back to their galaxy to share the lifesaving cosmic vibrations.  Not an easy task to be sure.  In order to impress the band members of the aliens' need for their cooperation, the aliens beam the band to their spaceship to explain their problem in person.  The aliens tell of their urgency and make their plea.  The band members sympathize, but fear leaving earth, their school, their friends, and the big contest coming up.

In a blink of an eye, the four band members are back on earth, seemingly as though they had just awakened from a dream-like trance.  They question whether they had just been on a spaceship or if they had dreamed the whole affair.  Nevertheless, the alien-induced dream ruse appears to have worked.  At least on a subconscious level, the members of the band are deeply concerned about the aliens' plight.

Knowing that the band is on the brink of agreeing to help the aliens, the agent goes to work even harder to convince the members to make the journey through outer space.  He enlists the aid of a fellow alien to disguise himself as a beautiful woman to seduce one of the male band members, since sex to humans is a powerful persuader.  At this point in alien evolution, sex is viewed as primitive and rather silly.  The beautiful alien laughs every time her assignment tries to put the moves on her.

Finally, the band gets word of a last minute cancellation of a contestant's appearance at the band contest.  ""Toomorrow"" is asked to appear in their place.  By now, it is clear to the alien agent that the group's conscience would never allow them to simply permit an alien race to perish.  The band enters the arena, jumps on stage and breaks out into song.  Knowing he has the band's full cooperation, even if it lies on a subconscious level, the alien agent signals the spaceship to beam up the band.  However, not only does the band (which is still performing) head skyward, the entire arena does, too, including the audience and dancing crowd.

We assume the band is successful in its journey to the alien galaxy to share their special cosmic vibrations, thus saving the alien race.

And just as the aliens had returned the band members to earth following their first trip aboard the spacecraft, making the band think it was all a dream, the aliens repeat their little ruse.  The band members awake in their own beds, each believing their trip to a galaxy far, far away was only a dream.

But we know better.

The movie ""Toomorrow"" has been circulating for years across our own planet in bootleg form.  There are at least three bootleg versions that I know of.  One is of the Japanese print of the film.  The soundtrack, including dialog, is in English, but Japanese subtitles appear on the right side of the screen.  The image quality is poor and appears to be a VHS copy of a copy of a copy.

Another bootleg is of a print from Spain.  The songs are in English and sung by the members of ""Toomorrow,"" but the dialog is dubbed entirely in Spanish.  The image quality is fair to poor.

The last is a bootleg from England.  The VHS copy of this bootleg has the clearest picture in comparison to the others, but I would still rate the image quality as less-than-good to fair.

The DVD on sale here appears to have been made from the same source material as the bootleg from England.  The transfer is definitely from at least a second-generation VHS copy.

Moreover, the DVD was transferred incorrectly, as audio only comes out of the right speaker.  However, the sound is crisp and clear.

The film itself was shot and presented in widescreen (2.35:1 aspect ratio), but the DVD is encoded in the standard TV format of 4:3.  If you have a widescreen TV, you will see black bars on the right and left sides of your screen, as well as bars at the top and bottom.  The movie will appear as a rectangle in the middle of the screen.

But for all its flaws, at least it's available.  US and Canada consumers should be aware the the DVD is in the PAL format, but is region free.  US and Canada DVDs are in the NTSC format (number of lines of resolution and frame-rate differentiate NTSC from PAL).  Unless the DVD player at home is capable of converting from PAL to NTSC automatically, US and Canada buyers will be restricted to watching the DVD on their computers.

A little trivia:  The gentleman who wrote the incidental music for ""Toomorrow"" also wrote the opening theme song for ""I Dream of Jeannie.""

This is in PAL  Video Format so you must have an all-region DVD Player to play this one on our home TV's.  Picture & sound quality not the best but an enjoyable copy. For me it's a one or two time video watch just because Olivia is one of my favorites. Music from the time is good. I liked Olivia better with Gene Kelly in Xanadu.

8512908,3,B0079KKJ3M,"1970 feature film ""Toomorrow"" had its 1st-ever ""official"" release on any video format with this 2012 Pickwick Visual Entertainment all-region DVD (cat.# 752199).  Potentially an Olivia Newton-John fan's dream come true, indeed it's wonderful to have a licensed, real DVD of this goofy ""cult"" film.  Newton-John's feature film debut is a reveal, in that it showcases the fact she is a natural comic actor.  Despite its weaknesses (plot & script, which actually strengthens its ""cult"" status), the film is an interesting snapshot of British pop culture, with near-accidental hints of the political unrest of the times.  For content, I would rate this with 5 STARS.  Unfortunately, for picture & audio element quality, the best I would rate is 2 STARS.  [So I'd give 3.5 STARS if able].  PICTURE: Not a film transfer; rather a generations-down video transfer that has frequent video hits and time base hits so picture ""flips"" (you can even see the VITC [vertical interval timecode] at those moments.  AUDIO: Mono (fine) but audio was encoded to only play out the RIGHT SPEAKER !!! (They didn't notice and correct this by making it ""dual mono"" at time of prep & encoding).  Sonic quality is fairly good, but I cannot believe they actually got so far as to release this on DVD and didn't pay attention to such a BASIC audio issue. That said, now that Real Gone Music got the rights to the original Soundtrack (just released and sounding quite nice!), one might hope TOOMORROW, the film, gets an actual Telecine film transfer and shows up on BluRay disc someday,,, sooner than later!",1392249600,,1577,4.920754716981132
