7981659,5,B00008DDV6,"I saw this film when it first came out in the 90's and I was so moved!!  It's great!! It's funny and there's adventure, and unlikely love story all wrapped into one movie.  If you like latin cinema, then you should check this out.  This would be a wonderful remake in the US  if Hollywood wasn't do biased against old people.  A complete shame.",1300924800,,344,4.3125
7981660,4,B00008DDV6,"Just to get this out of the way, Enrique Torres' review is a very good one of a very good film.  However, it does kind of have some spoilers, so if you read my review first, you might want to avoid his until you see the film (which I highly recommend), because he does give away some of the plot in his.

Having said that, let me recommend this very touching and inspiring film about facing growing older with courage and imagination, as well as holding onto your dreams.  It does have some subject matter that some people might find slightly offensive.  I did not.  I found the film moving and entertaining (and funny at times).  It is in Spanish with English subtitles (at least the version I saw).  It won 6 Ariel awards, which is the Mexican equivalent of our Oscars, I think).  And it deserved to.

The performances, writing and direction are all superb.  The only reason I give it only 4 rather than 5 stars is a) I save 5 stars for those films that I know I will want to watch more and more and that are classics in my book.  This is close to that, and maybe as I live with it, I will want to upgrade my rating some day and b) all the characters are pretty 3 dimensional and real, except for one or two.  It is not a big deal, but it just very slightly flaws this almost-masterpiece.

I recommend this film for anyone who likes spiritual cinema (in fact, I saw it via Spiritual Cinema Circle's monthly offering) and human stories.",1213488000,2,1437,4.277777777777778

It was brought to my attention recently(6-15-08) that my description borders on giving the movie away(sort of but not really, just part of a basic plot outline); so reader beware,here comes, SPOILER ALERT! Although there are five eldery men in the nursing home, Bruno, played by Jorge Galvan is the main character. He is a sentimental sort who has a special place in his heart for Rosita. Rosita is an aged singer in the nursing home who sang with Bruno as he played the piano. Rosita dies and her death is the impetus for the story line to develop. It seems Rosita wanted her ashes delivered to Tijuana for a final resting place and Bruno wants to make her wish come true. He escapes on a stolen maintenance workers bike  from the nursing home and the adventure begins. He goes looking for Margarita who is supposed to take the ashes. He hunts her down to her work which is a cabaret and more fun develops in the story. She dreams of Australia and following an old lover. The other gentlemen escape after seeing a most wanted image of Bruno on TV. They hook up with Bruno and then they really get involved with the wrong people. They are given new instrument cases which prove to have more than instruments inside. In the end all ends well and dreams are achieved and new ambitions realized. It is a good movie with a bit of the flavor of the American movies about old guys with Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon. Incidently ,this movie was the vehicle for a Best Actor for Jorge Galvan(also featured in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Optical-Fibre-Fibra-Optica/dp/B000069I16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Optical Fibre (Fibra Optica)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/En-El-Pais-De-No-Pasa-Nada/dp/B00005MEWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">En El Pais De No Pasa Nada</a>&nbsp;and Leticia Huijara for Best Actress in the Mexican Oscar equivalent, known as an Ariel. Recommended for a light hearted look at aging and resisting societies barriers. The antics of these old guys will surely make you laugh and that alone is priceless.",1050883200,10,2206,5.354466858789626
