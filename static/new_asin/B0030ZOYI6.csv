8386308,1,B0030ZOYI6,"I cannot tell  you the disappointment when we were half way through Jamaica Inn and the film suddenly skipped to the end. Useless. What do you do - buy another copy? This was only the second movie we watched in the collection. It quite puts you off even trying with the others. We got a refund, but what a waste of time. No need these days for faulty goods to be sold like this.",1342828800,10,378,4.108108108108108
