8176488,4,B000NA2UD2,"This is a really good Motorhead documentary, but if you are a big fan of this band (like me) you've seen or heard most of this before. It's a very nice package though because you get a general history/overview of the band on DVD 1, an excellent Wurzel interview on DVD 2, and a nice 42 page booklet about the band.
I was disappointed that this DVD really only focuses on the band up through Orgasmatron, and 99% of the focus is on the Philthy/Fast Eddie lineup. I don't think Mickey Dee is mentioned at all on the program. VERY little about Phil Campbell. However, I did like the in-depth review of the Robbo/Perfect Day era. That was really interesting. The other negative about this set is that it's not ""authorized"" by the band, so there is little (I'd say almost none at all) commentary from Lemmy himself. The discussion is from Motorhead fans and heavy metal critcs/reviewers (the same guys interviewed on the Ace of Spades classic albums program). But I would say it's worth buying because the Wurzel DVD and the booklet are both excellent.

Pros:
Good overview of the Philthy/Fast Eddie era
Rare footage and discussion of Another Perfect Day and Robbo (and even a little on Pete Gill)
Wurzel interview on DVD 2
Packaging includes nice booklet

Cons:
No Lemmy interview
No direct input/interviews from Philthy or Fast Eddie
Lacking footage and info about Mickey D and Phil Campbell
Gerry Bron is not a good interview (in this and other interviews he sounds like an idiot)

Overall this is a very nice set for Motorhead fans. I don't think it's as good as the Ace of Spades classics albums DVD. If you own that one and the Inside Motorhead DVD the Videobiography may be redundant. Although I do own those other two DVDs, have read Lemmy's book White Line Fever, and also own Stage Fright and the ""video EP"" with Girlschool, I still enjoyed the Videobiography.",1185753600,5,1865,4.6454545454545455
