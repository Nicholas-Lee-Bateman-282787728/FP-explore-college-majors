8174304,5,B000N30ATU,"Not only did the DVD arrive several days earlier than expected (and unopened), but it came with several decals (too bad that didn't include a ""Live Like Jay"" decal or an ""O'neil"" decal but the ones he sent will be put to good use even though I am merely an old body Soul Surfer (Single Overheads and Higher at Daytona Beach, Virginia Beach, Pensacola Beach, Myrtle Beach and elsewhere too long ago to remember fully).  The included one-page of information that any Mavs surfer needs to know (unfortunately, I will not likely ever be one) has already been placed in my ""Backstory"" file for the first of seven planned RomCom novels.

It was an incredible film all the way (especially the interviews with Jay and others) but sad to watch knowing that I was watching Mark Foo for the last time (I wish the film had included his first run).  While the cause of Mark's death will never be known, it is comforting to learn that there appeared to be no sign of struggle (according to ""Doc"" who examined his body at the scene).  The film did dispel a few misconceptions I had (I am a former body surfer and body flyer but will likely never ride a short board - much less a ""gun"" in this lifetime) and helps me now as I accept a similar risk in many ways, working on Project Pontiff.  We always know what can happen and probably to a person don't believe that the risk has played out until the last instant (the same way Greg Long fought successfully at Cortes Bank).",1390262400,,1457,4.4216417910447765
