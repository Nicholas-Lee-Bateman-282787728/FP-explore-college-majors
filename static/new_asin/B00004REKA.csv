7920723,5,B00004REKA,"I love these videos. While they're not ""mainstream famous,"" they are deeply moving.  Bryn Yemm, a fabulous Welsh singer, gives us some of our favorite songs from the sites that probably inspired them.  I especially love hearing him sing ""In the Garden"" from the Garden of Gethsemene.",1134691200,,283,5.0
