2350250,2,B000A26M1Y,"How Many Videos Have they made on the Masterbation Subject?

Sometimes A Theme can be overdone! How About Something Different

This is an over rated video and there may be some value however, it is way too expensive for the little value you get. There are far better videos and martial books (not to mention cheaper) that can teach you many aspects of female orgasm as oppose to this video focusing on one aspect of female orgasm.

How About Something Different, For Instance The Art Of Oral is just as important and takes the same if not more skill. They should make a comprehensive tutorial for women

learning oral how to perform oral ( on male and female )

Hey How about a Different Theme For change! It just might boost sales!",1130198400,36,732,4.515151515151516
2350251,5,B000A26M1Y,"This video has a very personal feel to it.  The woman in the video talks before and after the demonstration about how her ideas about masturbation have changed since taking courses with the Welcomed Consensus and the positive impact that masturbation has on her life and her relationship with her husband.

She peaks herself several times over the course of the video and the narrators' comments about what she is doing and feeling add greatly to the experience.

After several viewings I noticed that I could feel what it feels like when she pauses. I could feel that desire for her to put her finger back when she does, I can feel how much more intensity there is than there would have been if she just keep stroking until she went over. Just that alone, taking that ebb and flow and gradual building to great intensity into my make outs with my partner is worth many times the price of this video. It's great that this woman agreed to capture her own masturbation on film so that other people could experience and incorporate that into their own sex lives.",1129680000,5,1059,4.592592592592593
2350252,1,B000A26M1Y,"Too bad there is no such thing as a zero star.  This video is such a bored-fest.  I was actually given this video for free by a friend of mine but after viewing this now I know why this was free.  I came to Amazon to see just how much this pathetic video was and to my amazement, almost 30 dollars.  After viewing about 5 minutes of this video I was already yawning.  I thought, okay, pretty soon, I will learn some new fantastic technique or some sort of new secret but neither.  Here is the basic plot of the video - play with clitoris, drink water, play with the clitoris, end of plot.  It is probably better to burn your money and to buy this god awful video.  Another poor quality video by the Welcomed Consensus.  Folks before you buy this video, do the research on the internet about the videos and especially the company who is producing it, you will be amazed what you find out about this company.",1129593600,34,906,4.251461988304094
2350253,1,B000A26M1Y,"I wouldn't be surprised at all if people from Welcomed Consensus and their friends are beefing up reviews on their products.  I saw the other reviewer mentioning about the five star reviews and I did look into it and yes, it is the same reviewers and same five stars on all the videos made by this company.  I saw the video and I wasn't impressed.  I thought of returning it but it is a bit of a hassle and  Amazon has a limited partial refund policy within certain time period from purchase, although I would think if the video is so great that it would be the company Welcomed Consensus offering a money back guarantee even if it was purchased from Amazon as long as you have the video and receipt to prove it, but no such luck.  Other option is the dvd disc makes a good coaster for your coffee table be it an expensive one.",1129161600,34,827,4.24203821656051

8072379,4,B000A26M1Y,"This video show a woman pleasuring herself. She is real, she shares her orgasm with us. I appreciate she would make herself so vulnerable and let us see what she does it. She is not a model but a woman we can relate to, which makes it easier for every woman to relate to.",1335744000,,271,4.037037037037037
8072380,1,B000A26M1Y,"Denise is exceptionally NOT beautiful, although tastes may vary. She s covered in tattoos all over and you are forgiven for thinking she might have been picked up in a homeless shelter. For your 15 USD you get 25 minutes of almost motionless sitting and masturbating with very little action and no noise, in fact the only sound is a somewhat ""instructive"" female voice offering useless explanations from the off. The movie, if you want to call it like this, is cheaply made and cheerless.",1276214400,,488,4.752941176470588
8072381,5,B000A26M1Y,"A fun simple DVD of a woman sharing her experience with the viewer. I like the entire series because it is real. Denise answers questions about the good effects that self-pleasuring has on her sex life with her husband. The demonstration is simple, short and real. A little bit better quality in the production for the next one would be great. In my case, I prefer the reality of the orgasm over the quality of the production, having both would be even better.",1192406400,2,460,4.554216867469879
8072382,5,B000A26M1Y,"If you are looking for a real view of a woman masturbating, this is it and this really is an educational video.  I learned many things from viewing it.  Also included is an interesting segment where the woman featured talks about her thoughts and feelings about orgasm, masturbation, sex and sensuality.  I found it extremely refreshing to hear a woman speak so openly and candidly about such a personal topic.  So this video is not only technique but is content rich in addition.",1189209600,3,480,4.746987951807229
8072383,4,B000A26M1Y,"This woman tells her story of masturbating and

how it correlates with the sex she has with her

husband.  This DVD is different than the other

masturbation video that I have seen,

as it includes a personal interview by the

woman that tells the viewer what she feels in her

body when she's doing the actual masturbation.

There is also a lengthy demonstration of her

masturbating, with close camera shots of the

method she is using to bring about orgasm.  I

tried the approach she describes and uses, and

find it to be a nice way to treat myself.

I even notice a difference in

how my body feels when I get into bed with my partner too!

Great video for women that want to get more out of masturbating.",1181347200,2,711,4.3538461538461535
8072384,5,B000A26M1Y,"This was a different experience to watch another woman. It shows a woman actually giving herself an orgasm for all to see and talking about how orgasm has enhanced her life and made her a more sensual woman. The talk about masturbation is great, what it adds to a person's life, why do it, when and for what reasons. Hearing her speak so eloquently about her body and how she pleases herself, provides space for reflection.

This was not another Barbie-type erotic sex tape; this was educational, sexy and mature and actually held quite a lot of valuable information for someone like me, who wants to take my sensual and sexual experiences to a different place.",1180396800,13,661,4.698275862068965
8072385,5,B000A26M1Y,"An good video that goes beyond theory to show what one woman does to improve her sex life with her husband. Denise was candid and thoughtful in her discussion about exploring her body and I like her honesty. While masturbating she shows by example what she means when she describes her feelings about her orgasm. She explicitly shows how she explores the sensational potential of her clitoris which was a turn on to see in such detail

The video production is good, but not fancy which I think ads to the quality of what I'd call a perfect combination of erotic and documentary styles.",1177891200,16,585,4.625
8072386,5,B000A26M1Y,"I bought this video because I had had another one of the videos by the same people and I had liked it.  This one was also great in the same way, which is to say that you can tell that the woman who is masturbating really likes what she is doing. It looks like it feels really good.  This is a rarity in masturbation videos and I have seen a lot of them.

At the end, Denise talks about her experiences of masturbating and that part was particularly informative.  It was things I would want to ask my friends if I felt like I would get a straight answer. She was being candid.

I always wondered why sometimes when I masturbate it would feel really good and sometimes it would just be alright. I feel like I understand what goes into a more intense session now.

I could use this video just for the fun of seeing a woman do it to herself like she really would. However, I got a lot more out of it than just a short lived jolt.",1177891200,15,925,4.054945054945055
8072387,1,B000A26M1Y,"Definitely does not live up to the expectation. Not a great anatomy lesson, no great new techniques, only one technique - pause - in fact. Not worth the money or your time. Sigh.",1177804800,,178,4.424242424242424
