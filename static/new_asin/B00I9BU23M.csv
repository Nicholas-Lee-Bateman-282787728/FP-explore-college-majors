8640076,2,B00I9BU23M,"This was obviously intended as escapism film noir but it pales when you compare it to classics like ""Out Of The Past"", the penultimate film noir, or even ""Criss Cross"" or ""I Walk Alone"", both great Burt Lancaster film noirs. Lundigan was most likely this film studio's Dennis O'Keefe but he never attained the popularity of O'Keefe, probably because he was so wooden as an actor. I believe he did some TV guest appearances on popular TV crime shows when his movie career waned. Much the same for longevity goes for Lundigan's co-star in this, Jacqueline White. Does anyone remember her or anything she did either before or after this? No? I didn't think so.",1407888000,2,657,4.721739130434782

8640078,5,B00I9BU23M,"This fun and flavorful RKO crime film set in Mexico gave William Lundigan better material and a bigger budget than he was used to for his lead efforts, making this one of his best. Robert Wise's sure direction and RKO's trademark attention to detail, even in their mid-budget efforts, turned an average ""B"" crime entry into a lot of fun. Jacqueline White was pleasant and pretty as the girl Lundigan was chasing, and even surprised with a lovely song so good it could just as easily have been saved for a bigger budget film with more star power. RKO touches like this are only one of the reasons it is my favorite studio for classic films.

Steve Hastings (Lundigan) is an insurance detective more than happy to follow pretty Vickie Ames down to Mexico in search of her brother. The agency is still looking for both he and the necklace he may have stolen. Hastings needs to find out if either she or her brother are involved, and if not, just what happened. He starts cozying up to her on the plane and it doesn't stop when they get to Mexico, despite her initial cool reaction. We know, of course, they'll get together and figure it all out, because we've seen it all before. But this one is really enjoyable.

In one reversal of form, the Mexican cops are not only honest, but helpful, and in another, even though he's basically a private detective, he's treated on the square by the cops in Mexico, as sort of the good guy. It's a nice touch which will sort of jump out at those of us who've seen a million of these. A little Spanish girl's doll may hold all the answers when the bad guys appear to have the drop, but the best moment is saved for last, leaving a smile on the viewer's face.

Nice locations and sets, some fine if uninspired direction from Wise, and a really nice cast of ""B"" players make up for a not-so-lavish budget and the covering of familiar ground in this one. Just a really nice ""B"" mystery with an abundance of atmosphere that entertains in exactly the way it was intended. By far one of Lundigan's best films, and a terrific one for fans of this genre. This one goes down great with a big sub and a coke on a Saturday afternoon. A really satisfying ""B"" from RKO.",1393459200,8,2191,4.391625615763547
