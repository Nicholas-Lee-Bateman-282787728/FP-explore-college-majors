8756048,5,B01DJQ9ZEI,"If, like me, you enjoy these old 50s sci-fi movies you'll love this one.  This is a really bad, meaning great, movie.  I absolutely loved it!  OK acting (like anyone cares) and, actually, a fairly original plot.  The monster is great and, after all he came all the way from Venus!  Now that's worth somethin' right?",1503360000,,315,4.553571428571429

8756050,1,B01DJQ9ZEI,Great movie. Amazon streaming transfer is unwatchable. Buy the DVD instead.,1485475200,,75,5.909090909090909
8756051,2,B01DJQ9ZEI,A slow stupid movie we figured out in the first few minutes.  The only reason we kept watching was to see Zontar.  Just a demon what a joke.  Didn't look anything like the picture-tricks you into renting.  Shame on them for that!,1474416000,,229,4.380952380952381
8756052,5,B01DJQ9ZEI,Excellent vintage Science fiction!,1472860800,,34,7.75
8756053,2,B01DJQ9ZEI,I'm sure it's an epic film but all I could get was audio and pink lines...crazy man.,1467158400,,84,4.0
8756054,5,B01DJQ9ZEI,Mental b-movie scifi monster movie that is well worth watching. Lots of fun!,1461369600,,76,4.923076923076923
8756055,2,B01DJQ9ZEI,"A cheap remake of a classic Roger Corman low budget movie. It has John Agar, but doesn't have Martin Landau. It is a poor film to digital transfer. I would actually give it 2 1/2 stars just because it tries SO hard to be serious.",1460678400,,229,4.111111111111111
