7872340,3,6304438966,"This video is very ""skinny"" on actual video footage of Malcolm. It's well done as far as the quality of the footage (audio and video), however, you could buy an audio cassette and in some ways get much more for your money.  I was hoping for a series of full speeches and interviews but what I got was short clips disbursed between audio played over civil rights movement footage.
My suggestion: rent it from the library and decide for yourself whether it's worth buying.",993081600,21,470,4.595238095238095
7872341,4,6304438966,"Malcolm X was as close as the 20th century gets to a master of all the aspects of rhetoric, from tight logic to raw power of delivery, and from shrewd audience analysis to deep pathos.  These speech clips give you a  chance to see why.  Several major speeches are represented, and there are  especially good clips from the Jesse Gray rally and from his  probably-best-single speech, ""the Ballot or the Bullet"" (Audubon  Ballroom March 29 1964).  Editing is smooth and intelligent -- and  excessive, because there could easily have been 20 instead of 10 minutes  out of ""Ballot or Bullet"", and there is only one clip from one of  his many speeches on Islam, where at least three would be needed to  represent the major periods in his thought.  His speech against the draft  and against enlisting is excellent, also; for a good example of how fine he  was at extemporaneous work, see his replies to television  interviewers.
There are a couple of speeches overlaid with nostalgia  footage, but those may have been ones for which no visual track  was  available; some background hiss and rumble suggests they were originally  recorded on audio tape.
Clips generally don't suffer much from internal  cuts and are usually clearly labelled.  This would be a five star tape if  there were just twice as much of it -- which there should have been.  Bring  out volume II!",953856000,30,1362,4.746781115879829
7872342,4,6304438966,"For people looking for archival footage of Malcolm X -- this is a good start. The video features film and audio of the great leader Malcolm X -- mostly as excerpts from some of his famous speeches. While the video is  great because it is packed solid with Malcolm X and no supplementary  nonsense, it is very short, at 41 minutes -- the film will end long before  you want it to. I can't say this video gives a great overview of Malcolm X,  but it is definately good to have if you've never seen him in video or  heard some (parts) of his speeches.",948153600,19,548,4.180952380952381
