8229171,3,B000XPZTAS,"""Ghost Wife"" is only eight minutes long, and it is divided into three parts, each about two or three minutes. Each part also has beginning and end credits, thus reducing the time for the film itself even further. So ""Ghost Wife"" is one seriously short film, long on style and short on plot.

The first part seems like something right out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The/dp/B0006SGYL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grudge/dp/B00005JNJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grudge</a>. In a long shot, we see a woman slumped in a chair. Eventually, she slumps down further and crawls off screen, her hair hanging down over her face. I am loath to reveal what comes next since such a revelation might constitute a spoiler given the short length of the segment.

In the second and third parts, we do see the husband, and his ghostly wife appears again, once in a manner significantly reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks/dp/B000UX6THK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks</a>&nbsp;and once almost entirely through the eye hole on her husband's front door.

I should note that throughout the three films, the image jumps, one hears the sounds of a film projector, and the pictures are full of splotches, as if we are looking at a very old film on a less-than-state-of-the-art projector. Clearly, the filmmaker intended these effects, though I am not sure to what end. In addition, the film is in black and white, though this choice does make sense to me as it makes the images far more effective.

Since ""Ghost Wife"" is not really a narrative film but is instead more of a series of moods, it is difficult to assess. For potential buyers, the fact that there really isn't a story here is important, I think. We never learn why the woman is haunting her former husband or how she died. Naturally, film need not be narrative to succeed, but even accepting this point, I had trouble getting past my first reaction, which was, ""I saw this in 'The Grudge.'""",1198368000,,2398,6.324159021406728
