7938326,2,B00005ICGT,"So I grabbed this film because I love B grade action flicks. But even more so because it has Karen Kim from the classic 90's show Battledome and US seals 2 starring in it,in lets just say some ""ahem"" pretty revealing scenes. It turns out the uncut release is the PAL region 2 version,this one cuts the entire karen kim love scene out completely. Really unnecessary and for that this gets a 2,stop the censorship",1449446400,,411,4.493333333333333
7938327,2,B00005ICGT,"""The Silent Force"" is the last vehicle of former Hong Kong star Loren Avedon to receive a wide video release, and I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed in it. A good martial arts cast and an equally good action choreographer (J.J. Perry,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Bone/dp/B002FU8JTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood & Bone</a>) are under- and mis-utilized by a one-time writer/director whose attempt at a carefree action flick that didn't take itself too seriously turned downright lazy. Preemptively, I advise everyone to stay away.

The story: when an elite federal team known as the Silent Force is all but wiped out by a vengeful Asian crime lord (George Cheung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-First-Blood-Part-2/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: First Blood, Part 2</a>), it will be up to lone survivor Frank Stevens (Avedon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-the-Kickboxers/dp/6302128161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of the Kickboxers</a>) to redeem his fallen brothers and bring down the largest cartel on the west coast.

As I said before, the cast is promising for a martial arts movie but is not made the most of at all. Roger Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shanghai-Noon/dp/B00003CXJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shanghai Noon</a>) plays a top enforcer but gets only one short, lazy fight with Avedon. Karen Kim, who was great in Isaac Florentine's underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Seals-2/dp/B00005RDRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Seals 2</a>, plays an entirely fight-free infiltrator whose main contribution is a sex scene. J.J. Perry himself has a small role early on, taking part in one of the most blatantly staged weapons encounters I've ever seen. Matthias Hues returns at the end of the picture to give Loren a rematch of their showstopper in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender-2/dp/B0002ISFZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender 2</a>, and it seems like they could have a really good fight were it not for the constant cutting away to another scene and the abortive ending (by the way, when did this self-professed racist crime syndicate start hiring tall, blonde Germans?). Prior to that one, Avedon has a forgettably quick encounter with pro wrestler Nick Danger. The best fight happens about halfway through the film between Loren and an unnamed bounty hunter, and while it's pretty good, it neither reaches your expectations of the star nor is worth the price of the movie alone.

Sure, there are some shootouts and a boat chase, but neither is worth mentioning. The production quality is decent in a ""we blew all our money to get this cast so bear with us"" kind of way, (SPOILER) so it's forgivable when Frank's buddy (Clint Jung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shopping-for-Fangs/dp/B002JT6AL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shopping for Fangs</a>) ends up being fed to stock footage of sharks instead of the real deal. What isn't forgivable is the overuse of black fadeouts, which I haven't seen this many of since video production class in junior high, or the fact that too many scenes are simply uncomfortably blocked and inharmoniously edited. On a good note, the acting is generally passable with the exception of Brian Tochi as the mob boss' son: this is the same guy who voiced Leonardo in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Turtles-movies/dp/B0000VV3U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Turtles movies</a>, and damn if he's not the single most annoying character I've seen (and heard) in a long, long while. How come he didn't get fed to the sharks instead?

The fact that he'd only star in an unreleased film and a couple supporting parts following this one kind of brings Loren Avedon's career full circle, and the presence of Matthias Hues helps emphasize this point. It's a shame that it couldn't end as good as it began, and it's an even bigger shame that I had to spend ten bucks on a movie that disappointed me as completely as this one. There's nothing to see here that you can't find in better form anywhere else, so don't bother with this one.",1318032000,,4444,6.268412438625204
7938328,4,B00005ICGT,"Very B-grade but good action flick, especially if u like martial arts and Loren Avedon. I was hoping to see more of Roger Yuan in this film but he didn't have any fight scenes in it which was a downfall, however, the action in this was OK.

The Silent Force is an ultra-secret branch of the U.S Government's Drug Enforcement Agency whose training and experience makes them the ultimate fighting machines. Unknown and untouchable, they strike with blinding professionalism and deadly accuracy. There is only one problem: Hue Gung Poa. Hung is the leader of an asian ring of international drug dealers who has made it his life's mission to completely eliminate the Silent Force. Leading a brutal crusade, he is finally able to wipe out the entire unit, that is, except for Agent Frank Stevens Poa's arch enemy. Filled with a thirst of revenge, Stevens will stop at nothing to bring down the Poa empire. His only help and anchor of security is Nancy Woo, a beautiful undercover agent who has infiltrated Poa's organization. Together, they must stay alive long enough to extract enough justice they demand and emerge on top with their sanity intact.",1137110400,,1145,4.841836734693878
7938329,5,B00005ICGT,"This is the best movie yet that Teddy has acted in. His onscreen persona is simply amazing and beautiful. His lasting impression in this movie is going to be remembered by many people by the way he falls. As an early Teddy fan, I can say that this movie is a must have in everybody's collection.",1019001600,2,295,4.285714285714286
