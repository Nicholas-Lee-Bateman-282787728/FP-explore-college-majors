7564862,3,B0197DK3PW,"Wow, I have a lot of conflicted feelings about this flick. Overall it was pretty freaking creepy. Honestly though it took awhile to really get going for my tastes but it wasn't unbearable. A major problem I had with this movie though was the main camera guy Dan. He was such a terrible human being, like I'm talking borderline sociopath. Everything had to be what he wanted friends and sister be damned. Most of the other characters were alright but they were pretty crappy people as well. I would recommend this movie to people who like found footage movies that get under one's skin, but I can't give this more than three stars because I was to distracted by how terrible the characters were as people, like I don't know which was worse the characters or the slender-man. Speaking of which there was some decent background on the mythology of the slender-man thing but I would have liked a bit more.",1458604800,4,901,4.60248447204969

7564868,1,B0197DK3PW,Man!!!! What a rip off. A movie about Slenderman..but not even a glimpse of him!!! The film-makers should be ashamed of themselves!! Found footage fans pass on this one.

7564872,3,B0197DK3PW,"So far I've seen at least 2 Slenderman movies come out on dvd and quite frankly, I'm one of those people who can watch bad things and still get enjoyment out of them. I'd say the other reviews on here are pretty fair, depending on how long you can stand slow progress, acting, goofiness and whatnot. Always Watching, the other Slenderman movie, was basically a ripoff of Marble Hornets, which you can watch for free on Youtube and wasn't horrible...yet it wasn't great. This Slender movie...I'd honestly rate it higher than Always Watching. 2/3 of the movie does go on (rather slowly) and I'm still not sure why a prank had to be the highlight of the whole film where things really pick up. We never do get to see character development (typical of these movies) and the progress is slow. I mean REALLY slow. At least 20 minutes of the movie is taken up by the ""48 Hours documentary"" thing the characters in the movie have going on, then one of the guys gets it in his head to scare the woman who's story they were trying to tell all for the sake of a ""real"" reaction. That's where the movie finally picks up and it really doesn't lead to a good ending. For how the ending went, I enjoyed it up to the very end. It felt very...just not like an ending. There seemed to be a huge gap they could have filled in. And unless I missed something, Slenderman does not appear at all in the entire film. Not much of a spoiler there. I give this 3 stars because I found it pretty good for what it was. Certainly wasn't the best, but it wasn't the absolute worst either.",1462060800,,1557,4.3174061433447095
7564873,3,B0197DK3PW,"You could tell this movie was trying, but it never quite came together for me. Your mileage may vary, but I found it to be a long, slow build-up to not very much payoff. Also, I kept wanting to smack the main character until my arm got tired, what with the number of times he filmed people without their permission and the number of times he lied about the camera being on.

I gave this movie three stars kind of like an A for effort - making a film about the iconic Slenderman was worth a shot, and the movie deserves some props even though, in my opinion, they missed.

One way I think this could have been better is if it had been working in evidence that Slenderman was stalking the characters from very early on. At first, I thought they were going to do that during the skype call, but (spoilers)

it was just a cheap jumpscare.",1462060800,,834,4.232704402515723

7564876,1,B0197DK3PW,"This is one of the movies where there was just enough of a kernel of a good idea that I was hoping it would turn into something, but it never did. I've seen other reviews that praise the acting, and enjoyed the side ""plots,"" but I just don't see it.  I suppose that, if you like to see people acting like unlikable, narcissistic, indecisive sots, then you may enjoy this movie. I've used this phrase before, but it applies here as well: this is an idiot plot movie - if everyone in the movie wasn't an idiot, there'd be no movie. Spoiler alert: it's supposed to be about Slender Man, but he never appears in the movie. There are some very minimal ""found footage"" moments that could have been creepy, if they'd built a movie around that. Instead, the focus is on a ""documentary"" that apparently takes forever to make, then devolves into an insanely mean-spirited practical joke that no human being with a soul would ever contemplate, and leads to a completely unsatisfying and nonsensical ending.

This movie was terrible, slow, poorly filmed, the story sucked, the character development was bad.... I mean, this was bad. I really wish I could get my money back. I have watched you tube videos that follow the Slender man theme, that blow this thing out of the water. I mean, I wouldn't even watch this again if it was free.
You basically get to watch the first 2/3's of the film meander on while watching some crappie written witty banter jump between the characters, to them filming trying to scare a women whom came to them with her ""experiences"" to only get a slap dash and quite frankly, pointless ending....

7564880,1,B0197DK3PW,"This is a found footage film about Slender Man meant to be a documentary on two missing children, supposedly abducted. It takes 8 minutes before the group decide what they want to film poorly. They opt for a fictional anorexic figure which they apparently have never witnessed. Milli (Mili Parks) is the mother of said children and they PLOT SPOILER decide to surprise her with a fake Slender Man they created as a joke,

Okay, I am not going to tell you how that works out, but like most found footage junk, you don't get to see the title character. There was nothing interesting about the film.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. For those of us who have seen the real slender man, he normally appears at dawn or dusk when the shadows are long, almost never in bright daylight or at night. He comes out from the right side, not left like you see with the police footage. He is all black, no white markings. Slender, but not abnormally tall. He can travel alone, in numbers or with a wolf-like creature. And BTW you don't have to believe in him to see him.",1460419200,,1056,4.410256410256411

7564883,2,B0197DK3PW,"I really wanted to like this movie. It had some interesting moments during the story build up, but as other reviews stated it doesn't add anything new to the slender story.

This movie sort of strings you along with lukewarm creepypasta stuff and fails to pay off at the end.

Best/Worst part of the movie for me was in the beginning. When they are at the cafe brainstorming about making a movie/documentary.

One of them asked: 'What does a human being do when they just stop caring?'
The other replies: 'They make movies.'

This is followed by a gale of laughter from the actors and at first I was laughing with them. Until I realized that the joke was on me.

My reaction was this: 'Hah! Hahahaha..... oh....damn.'

It was a little hard to keep watching the movie after that, but I soldiered through it. So here I am wondering if this is what blue balls feels like for men.",1459728000,2,876,4.44375

7564888,2,B0197DK3PW,"The movie is about filmmakers making a documentary.  Slender has surprisingly defined characters, but nothing happens that the audience should care about.

7564890,3,B0197DK3PW,"I'm a sucker for found footage films, and I always found the Slender Man to be a good creepypasta.
But for what it is, down to the core of it, there's not a whole lot about Slender Man that's really THAT scary. With the original Slender Man game (2009), yeah, it was freaky at the time because it was pretty unique compared to others in the horror genre but it also played on other fears besides Slender Man. I dunno, I just think at this point (2015-16) its been too over done.
The build up to the ""scary"" parts was long over due, and I would have preferred watching cheesy scares for an hour of the movie with only a 20 minute build up than vice versa. At least it would have kept my attention longer. Don't get me wrong, I love a research build up some found footage films do, it can create a great vignette connecting the source material to the story. With Slender, that's kind of really easy/hard to do because the original material is so limited and honestly downright basic. Everyone who is into Creepypastas knows pretty much all there is about it.
The point is, I was sorta hoping a Slender movie from 2015 would have added something new to the table, a unique perspective, some artistic licensing, SOMETHING to give the concept of Slender a new facelift. Since the original game, there are now over 30 copycat games and/or mods that tell the same story over and over again. If you're going to spend actual money producing a film on the basis of an internet meme, at the very least make it your own! Make something inspired by it, add your own thing, maybe combine different things to make one thing, I don't know. But don't just slap a meme on a film title and give the audience watered down backwash from the internet, because at that point you are solely monetizing on beating a dead horse.",1459036800,5,1802,4.414414414414415
7564891,4,B0197DK3PW,"FINALLY! A good microbudget indie found footage horror movie!!

I really enjoyed this one. Believable acting (really good, actually - even from the supporting actors like the police officer and Millie, the mom), a compelling storyline, a good slow build. In looking at the bios online, it looks like this is Petrie's first film, so hoping for some more from this guy and the team.

The downsides to this one were perhaps not enough scares, especially in the first 3/4 of the film. And, unfortunately, the ending - the very end - was a bit disappointing.

But, overall, I really enjoyed this one. In fact, I'm watching it a second time right now. Well done, guys!",1458950400,3,662,4.689655172413793
