  True wit has to have an intelligence and grace to it.....SNL has more often than not appealed to the lowest in people.  We know why.  Comics call it ""Dick jokes"".  Always gets a laugh, but more important, gets the ratings. We know whats going on, right?  Money, money, money.
  There have been flashes of brilliance down through the years.  Its whats kept my interest in it.
Not much here, though.  If you're somewhat thoughtful, take a pass on this one.  If you're shallow, laugh easily, and pride yourself on being PC, this is for you.",1252108800,,687,4.56198347107438
7912496,4,B00000JL4P,"I bought this for the Norm Macdonald David Letterman skits. ""You enjoying the shirmp?!"" - hilarious!",1235779200,,100,5.3125
7912497,3,B00000JL4P,"I admit, I'm not the biggest SNL fan.  I really liked the older ones with Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, and so on.  The new ones are all right.  ""The Best of 1996-1997"" has sketches that are very funny.....and others that really aren't that good.
I mostly got it for the ""Joe Pesci Show.""  That has to be one of the funniest sketches I have ever seen.  I also liked, ""Celebrity Jeopardy,"" ""Goat Boy on Charlie Rose,"" and the sketches with Norm McDonald as Bob Dole and the one with him as David Letterman.  ""Hey. you got any gum?  Ha HA!""  The ""Star Wars"" auditions were also pretty humerous.  The other sketches I found not as funny.  In fact, I fast-forward through most of them because they were so unfunny.  Then again, that's just ME.
Was it worth the purchase?  Well, for the sketches I mentioned, yeah, it was worth it.  I just wish it didn't include the others, or if they were replaced by different ones.  Still, I found the tape pretty funny.  Again, I'm not the biggest SNL fan, so maybe you shouldn't be relying on my judgement.  I think if you enjoy SNL, you'll like this.  Hey, it's the ""Joe Pesci Show"" that makes this tape complete.  ""A little bit.  Little bit.""
Funniest moment:  ""Joe Pesci Show"":  When the REAL Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro confront the two actors portraying them.  Robert De Niro looks at the actor immitating him, points to him, and asks in a very subtle way, ""Who are you supposed to be?""  This was so funny that you even catch Joe Pesci bending down, trying to keep himself from laughing, but it's obvious that he IS laughing.  De Niro.  What a funny guy!",1026518400,3,1604,4.410958904109589
7912498,5,B00000JL4P,"This video is superb. I bought it from amazon a few months back and have watched it several times... definetly worth the minimal money I paid for it! it opens with a very funny Norm Macdonald impression of Bob Dole that gets interupted by... Bob Dole! and continues with some classics skits including... Spartans, The Roxbury Guys (With Tom Hanks), Star Wars Auditions, The Joe Peci show that gets interupted by... Joe Peci and a side splitting performance from Robert Deniro and one of the funniest Celebrity Jeopardy's ever with Burt Reynolds (Norm Macdonald), Jerry Lewis (Martin Short) and how could you have a celebrity jeopardy skit without Sean Connery! One of the cheapest SNL videos but also one of the best! You won't regret buying this comedy masterpiece!",1004572800,5,766,4.945736434108527
7912499,5,B00000JL4P,"This video Rocks!! Every skit on this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh or chuckle in some way. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this video as much because I'm more of a bigger fan of SNL's earlier stuff. Earlier as in Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, and Phil Hartman. But this video had me cracking up! I must have re-wound some of the parts 3 or 4 times because they were so damn funny! This video is well worth adding to your collection. It is highly recommended from an SNL ""Junkie"". Peace!!",983232000,3,499,4.208333333333333
