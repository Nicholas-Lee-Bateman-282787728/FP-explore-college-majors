5616245,5,B00BGC1GX6,"Who are you going to serve?  That is the Question of the day.  Augustine chose, but it was not an easy choice. Wealth, fame, power and a life of ease were all left behind, but he did it for the right reason.",1405555200,,207,3.9047619047619047
5616246,5,B00BGC1GX6,"It is sad how little today's Christians know of the men and women of the past greatly used by God. Children (and adults) today in many churches do not even know much about the most basic names in church history. Many no longer take time to read, preferring to be entertained by sports or television or other forms of worldly amusements. The Torchlighter series is intended for children, but should be seen by all ages. The extra interviews and other features are also well worth watching. We need to see once again what it really means to live the Christian life. We need to fill our hearts and minds with that which is good and leads us nearer to God. These Torchlighter videos help us do that.",1394668800,,695,4.480314960629921
5616247,5,B00BGC1GX6,I have all of the Torchlighters series to my knowledge and they are very inspiring and uplifting. I would recommend these to everyone.,1383264000,,134,4.869565217391305
5616248,5,B00BGC1GX6,It's nice to have a real example of someone doing the right thing when temptation and ego would encourage them to do otherwise.  I had had no exposure to this story until coming across this video.,1382745600,,196,4.444444444444445
5616249,2,B00BGC1GX6,"When I ordered this I didn't realize Augustine was a Catholic priest, not a Christian ""follower of Christ"".  After doing much research to Catholicisms MANY pagan traditions and beliefs i got rid of the movie. It was a bummer because all of torch lighters other movies are excellent.  My children and I were really excited to watch this one only to be disappointed, he may had done a lot of good things but the Catholic undertones and symbols were not exactly what I'm trying to teach my children.",1378857600,6,496,4.625
5616250,5,B00BGC1GX6,"I have watched lots of animated movies about Christian and Catholic/Christian heroes from different companies.  Some are good, but many are disappointing.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  First, it was very truthful, honest, and accurate.  Maybe not in every small detail, but definitely in all the items that matter.  Second, it was very entertaining.  The suspense was there and it kept your attention.  Third, I felt it would be appropriate for children, and they'd get a good Christian message out of it.

I do hear the concern that it would be better to have more on Augustine after his conversion. I agree, although I think the movie would then have had to be longer than 35 minutes.",1375056000,,707,4.785123966942149
5616251,5,B00BGC1GX6,We love this series!  Make sure to watch the documentary.  My children have enjoy watching this entire series and also doing the study guide.  My older children enjoyed leading a class of younger children with this.  They watched the animated portion and then worked on the activities.,1374364800,,285,5.0
5616252,3,B00BGC1GX6,"The torchlighter series is great because most feature a 30 minute animated kids-style featurette but the DVDs also contain a 1 hour documentary as well.  I had high hopes for this one as Augustine was one of the greatest Christian father's of the faith.  He was a great Christian thinker and after the apostles he was the greatest theologian of the first 1000 years of church history.  So I was very disapponted when 95% of the featurette as well as about 95% of the documentary majored on his life prior to his conversion.  The documentary seemed to be of lesser quality than other movies in the torchlighter series as well and primarily featured dialogue from a single historian of Augustine.  Again, both the animated movie and the documentary were okay....but so much potential was wasted.....",1369699200,7,797,4.874074074074074

5616264,5,B00BGC1GX6,"Watch this with your kids, it'll make you want to read the book!  I have only heard of this man in references in church sermons, he was a great ambassador for the Lord.  From what I gather, Augustine was Spurgeon before Spurgeon was Spurgeon.  A mom's prayers make a difference.  Now, off to the internet to find a copy of ""City of God.""",1437436800,,337,4.301587301587301
5616265,3,B00BGC1GX6,More about good teachings and good works than about Jesus Christ being the only hope for sinful man. But an ok story compared to a lot out there,1436918400,,144,4.178571428571429
5616266,4,B00BGC1GX6,Would recommend it. My kids ages 7&9 enjoyed it.,1436745600,,48,4.444444444444445

5616268,5,B00BGC1GX6,Well done and nicely animated. Much higher quality than many biblical/spiritual films out there. My kids really enjoyed them all!,1433721600,,129,5.5
5616269,5,B00BGC1GX6,The Torchlighters Series is amazing! It saddens me that not all the episodes are available on Amazon Prime Instant. These are incredible men and women of the faith throughout the ages and the world who stood up to act on salvation through Christ alone.,1433030400,2,252,4.75

5616273,5,B00BGC1GX6,"I watched this with my 2-year-old and loved it. While I know my toddler didn't understand all of it, I feel like it's appropriate to show her. She was entertained and will eventually understand it - by then, she will have memorized it.
My sister showed her 4 kids the Torchlighters series, and they loved them (from preschool to teen). My sister agrees that it is moving for adults as well.

The video is simple, which is good for kids. Other reviewers of other videos in the series said they are of poor quality, but I think that they are well made. The pictures are clear; the dialogue and story are easy to follow. With those combined, they actually can absorb the message.",1428019200,,676,4.495934959349594
5616274,5,B00BGC1GX6,Excellent!,1425686400,,10,10.0
5616275,5,B00BGC1GX6,"Don't let the animated format fool you--this is a dramatic story masterfully told, and shows an amazing depth of insight into the human heart.  If you've ever become someone in the eyes of the world only to realize the world doesn't see you for who you are, if you've ever set off on an adventure for riches and glory and ended up in the Catholic Church, if you've ever sacrificed a dream to God and received your true calling in return--well, this is just what it's like!",1422316800,,472,4.425287356321839
5616276,5,B00BGC1GX6,"Awesome story, great extras. This is not just a DVD but has a great lessons and activities for kids to increase their learning.",1422230400,,127,4.565217391304348
5616277,5,B00BGC1GX6,good story of real people. great for kids and adults.,1419638400,,53,4.4
5616278,3,B00BGC1GX6,Torchlighters is an excellent series for kids.  My kids watch them over and over again.  But this one does not live up to the standards of the rest of the series.  I don't know why.  This was a watch once and the kids don't care to see it again.  So I give five stars to the rest of the series to date.  But this one loose two stars for it lack of capturing the attention of the children.,1419120000,,388,3.91025641025641
5616279,4,B00BGC1GX6,This was a well done story. I did not realize it was an animated film when I ordered it. None the less it was well done and would be good for any child of faith.,1412899200,,161,3.6285714285714286
5616280,5,B00BGC1GX6,I love torchlighters... They are always so well done. We use them for homeschooling.,1406160000,2,84,5.071428571428571
5616281,5,B00BGC1GX6,"excellent, accurate portrayal.  The story was a little intense for my just turned four year old, but he really enjoyed it and learned a lot from it.",1405987200,,148,4.481481481481482
5616282,5,B00BGC1GX6,"This mini-documentary is about the life of St. Augustine, who lived in the Roman Empire around the 300s. In the beginning of his life, Augustine pursued wealth, fortune, honor, etc.(Sounds like many Christians of today.)  Augustine was highly educated; he went on to be the ""voice of the emperor"" (he was a great rhetorician) and because the emperor was only 12 years of age. However, after his encounter with Jesus Christ his life was never the same. He would discontinue to be the voice of the emperor; he decided to leave Milan, the residence of the emperor, and return to his native Africa. Back in Africa (modern day Algeria), Augustine would write many inflectional Christian books like, Confessions of St. Augustine, City of God, and On Christian Doctrine. Although this movie is made for kids, I, as an adult, greatly enjoyed this mini-documentary film.",1405641600,3,861,4.979166666666667
