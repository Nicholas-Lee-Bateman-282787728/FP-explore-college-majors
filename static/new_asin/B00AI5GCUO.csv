I am a tourguide in Japan.
I am going to use this movie when I guide visitors from overseas to let them laugh seeing a high-tech restroom scene.",1462665600,,187,4.529411764705882
8551872,5,B00AI5GCUO,"Thermea Romae is one of those movies destined to become a cult classic. It doesn't stop to explain how or why the hero can suddenly time travel, so if you are looking for logic please move along. The very Japanese looking hero moves through no fault or doing of his own through time between ancient Rome and modern day Japan getting into all sorts of scrapes on both ends.
Who knew baths could be so interesting? The movie draws on the common obsessions that both Japanese and Roman culture had with bathing, cleanliness, and baring it all as a form of relaxation. There is a quirky twee-ness about the entire movie with the seeming very low budget effects that depict the time travel travel sequences, but overall the story has a great deal of heart esp with the romantic elements.
Watch it for a good giggle, preferably in a bath with a mate and some bubbles.
Frothy, funny and worth getting.",1363737600,,894,4.559006211180124
