8640362,5,B0021YI73U,"I was not aware that Father's Day with Robin Williams and Billy Crystal is a remake of this movie.  I have to say I think the original is much better. I especially liked the scene where Gerald Depardieu teaches Pierre Richard the proper way to headbutt someone.  I laughed out loud.

Although very challenging for those learning French and wanting to work on listening skills, this movie entertaining enough to keep interested.",1485129600,,427,4.902777777777778
