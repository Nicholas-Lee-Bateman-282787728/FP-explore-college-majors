7276854,5,B00ZE500TM,"I loved this movie and was thrilled when they decided to turn it into a television series on Hallmark Channel.  After the first year of the series, they then decided to change the format and the channel.  The TV series became a series of movies and they moved it to Hallmark's newest channel:  Hallmark Movies and Mysteries.  At first I was a little upset with the move as I didn't see the advertisement and missed the first movie - but I've since changed my mind and this new channel has become my go-to television.

In the movie that started the series, we are introduced to Oliver O'Toole (Eric Mabius) who is the head of a group who tries to keep items in the mail from ending up in the dead letter files.  They are a group of individuals who work, or rather, have a calling for finding out where undeliverable mail should have been delivered.  Along with Oliver, is Norman Dorfman (Geoff Gustafson) a kind of ninja sleuth on all things undeliverable, Rita Haywith  (Crystal Lowe) a sweetie and expert on postal codes and procedures and who has a photographic memory, and Shane McInerney (Kristin Booth) the girl from the big city with advanced technical skills who has a potentially great career ahead of her in the postal service and just may have been mis-assigned to the group.

I was so pleased to find Eric Mabius in a great role after watching and enjoying him in ""Ugly Betty"".  He has been a favorite of mine including a couple of Hallmark movies.  The ensemble cast works great together.  Oliver is a little straight-laced and oddly formal, Shane is a breath of fresh air and ideas while bringing a bit of modern techniques to the group.  Norman is sweet and is a font of good ideas but is oblivious to most of what is going on in the world.  Rita is a real fun character.  She remembers everything she has ever seen or read.  She thinks the best of everyone and everything and is incredibly modest about herself.

I highly recommend this movie, the first year of the series and the follow-on movies (at this point there have been two but I understand there will be another coming out in September 2015.)  It is fun television that the whole family can watch together.  This movie really introduces the cast and sets the tone for everything that follows.",1439856000,68,2267,4.553086419753086

7276937,4,B00ZE500TM,"This is a review for the original movie Signed, Sealed, Delivered, not the two later movies Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas and Signed, Sealed, Delivered From the Heart, that share the came product page, though I would give those later movies this and higher ratings as well.  Just FYI, because when I bought this movie it was somewhat confusing to find out three of the movies from the series share the same page.

After watching the movies that take place later in this series several times now and loving them, we decided to buy this first movie because they never seem to re-show it on Hallmark Movies and Mysteries like they do with the others in the series, so we had never seen it before.  I can see why it became so popular, the concept is a very fun idea and seeing how viewers were first introduced to these characters was actually really interesting, because we were already so familiar with these characters from watching the later series and movies, seeing them before they've gone through all their later experiences was really fun.  This is a fantastic Hallmark movie series, with a very unique premise and characters, we have really enjoyed it and I completely recommend it.",1495584000,4,1198,4.7729468599033815

7276965,5,B00ZE500TM,"I was disappointed when Hallmark decided to switch SSD from a weekly series to a series of two hour movies, but as it turns out, the two hour format works very well for this series.

This movie has so many great moments, including some of my favorites in the whole series.  It is a true pleasure to watch any time of the year!",1488153600,,449,4.385542168674699

Each character's roles are superb.  Hats off to the producers and actors.  In the Christmas one, I love the part of Jordan--want to see more of him.

Each of these movies are so delightful and you never get tired of watching them.  I want to buy as many as come out for my collection.  Great for family watching.

Absolutely one of the most fun Hallmark movies either of us has seen in years! The plot was great, the characters delightful, the ending--well, great twist to the ending. (I sort of guessed it, but never figured how it would work out).

Highly recommended--and follow it up with the TV series! Too bad they ended the TV series after one season and just made a lot of SSD movies (which are kind of pricey).

7277149,5,B00ZE500TM,"Im no stranger to Hallmark movies.  I watch them because I like stories with happy or at least resolved endings and because I find no entertainment value in the gratuitous violence that dominates 80% of scripted programs on TV.  I cant always get all the way through a Hallmark movie  glaring factual errors, inconsistencies within the story, bad editing and terminally slow pace will send me running to a news channel.  But when I find a good one I often watch it more than once.  So it is with Signed, Sealed, Delivered.  I think Ive seen the whole set  the original pilot movie, the series of episodes, and the four later movies including Signed, Sealed Delivered for Christmas (2014), which is my personal favorite.  I hope there will be more.  There are many things to like about this series, but Ill mention the ones that might be of greatest interest to someone considering a purchase.  The characters are endearing  quirky individuals with certain complexities that make them less than predictable and yet understandable.  They are well-developed over time, not reduced to caricatures.  If one pays attention one learns something new about each of them in each episode.  The story from the pilot to the most recent movie is all of a piece.  Care has been taken to be true to the information already provided about the characters lives and experiences, and there are frequent references to past events to keep tying things together, which means that if the viewer, for example, watches Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas and hasn't seen the series he or she will figure out the context and essential character features and relationships pretty quickly.  The humor is subtle.  The basic premise is humorous  the seriousness of the work of the Dead Letter Office of the U.S. Postal Service  and it goes on from there.  Unlike the worst of Hallmark movies, there are relatively few script inconsistencies  occasionally a character refers to a document or past event inaccurately, but its a minor distraction.  Most of all, the relationships of the main characters with each other  what they learn from each other and teach each other, and how they approach the problems they are responsible for solving  is inspiring without being overly sentimental.  Ultimately it is Oliver OTooles story, and he is a very interesting, complicated man  well-educated, a lover of words and of things of quality from the past, a person with a heartbreaking story, a man of principle, and a man of faith.  The religious element is not overwhelming.  Often the story includes a moral dilemma or a challenge to a characters courage.  I particularly like the treatment in several episodes of questions of readiness and redemption  how when bad events separate people they need time to be ready to try to make amends or resolve the thing that separated them, and ultimately good usually comes from the effort, even if the passage of time has changed circumstances so that a full reconciliation is not possible.  For anyone on his or her own spiritual journey, stories of hope, goodness and the unexpected are food for thought.  Signed, Sealed Delivered, as a whole, is engaging and satisfying.  I recommend all of it highly.",1452384000,4,3211,4.9309701492537314
7277150,5,B00ZE500TM,"After watching this movie I can see why the series was not renewed, I mean after all a movie that refers to GOD and actually has characters that truly care about other people and are NOT jumping in and out of relationships and beds!!  Goodness!!  An actual honest to goodness non violent family movie?  What were they thinking?

I appreciate that each series' episode has a completely new--stand-alone---mystery story to enjoy.
It's a light 'n' breezy sort of detective show; no by crimes or murder! Also, there're new guest stars
every  couple episodes; such as Carol Burnett, Valerie Harper, Valerie Bertinelli, etcetera, which make
things more interesting... in an old-school, retro, '70s kind of way! Know what I mean, Vern?

He is the manager of the dead letter office in Denver and works with  two postal employees until they are joined by Shane, who has been sent to this location in error.  She finds herself drawn to this job.  The team normally picked letters out of the many they get and try to locate either the sender or the person it was meant to go to.  They have to follow clues in the letter after being unable to  garner the information
from the envelope.  This moving has Shane convincing them to locate a man who has been sent a letter he spent one day with and fell in love.  She insisted they use only first names and no other information.  Getting in contact with him sends the team on an unusual quest but with a successful ending.

However, I'm disappointed that it's airing on the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel rather than the original Hallmark Channel where it started.  For those of us who cannot get the Movies & Mysteries channel, Hallmark, please reconsider!",1442188800,6,400,5.092307692307692

8719975,5,B00ZE500TM,"Really nice movie.  Wish I'd been able to see it when it first came out on the Hallmark Mysteries Channel (I didn't have cable TV until last August).  They had a marathon back in January of this year, but I missed most of it unfortunately.  From what I have seen so far (the pilot movie, the 10 shorter episodes, and several of the movies), this series is far superior to ""Touched By An Angel"".  Hope that Martha Williamson continues to create SSD episodes for as many years as possible ... and that they come out on DVD as soon as possible (for those of us who didn't catch most of them on TV).",1525219200,,595,4.238938053097345
