8688313,3,B00PJOSTBO,"Weak story and character / dialogue writing, bland uninteresting action scenes (too reliant on CGI and fast motion), in other words, completely meaningless action scenes.  The first two movies were really good, but this third movie really only has value if you want closure from the end of the 2nd movie.  I'd really love the director to come out and say he'd made a big mistake and was going to go back to the drawing board, re-write & re-film the entire 3rd movie",1421798400,,465,4.590361445783133
