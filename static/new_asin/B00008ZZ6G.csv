1876696,1,B00008ZZ6G,"You have been warned!  Save your money, this movie is just plain awful.  The acting is terrible, and the film quality is even worse.  It looks as if the movie was filmed over a weekend for a high school film project.",1126396800,9,216,4.219512195121951
1876697,2,B00008ZZ6G,"Family Reunion the movie was not a bad movie in fact some parts of the movie was acctually funny, but the movie could have been better than what it was. I think maybe if Ringworm's character had been more funnier than it would have made a big differnce. I saw this movie last year, and when I bought it I thought that with the cast that Family Reunion had that the movie would be a hit. Well it's just a movie, but I would recommend this movie.",1122163200,3,444,4.114942528735632
1876698,1,B00008ZZ6G,"This was by far the worse so called movie I have ever been force to view, forced because I wanted to be fair if ever the ocassion came to comment on it.  A waste of everyones time.  I hope no one got paid from this.",1120867200,6,215,3.7555555555555555

1876700,1,B00008ZZ6G,I almost took it out of the DVD player and put it in the trash. The only thing stopping me is knowing that I paid money for it. Maybe I'll just leave it at the bus stop and let someone steal it. It got 1 star out of me because I can't put zero.,1112054400,5,244,3.537037037037037
1876701,1,B00008ZZ6G,"This movie is a waste of money. The only part that was funny was the character Mike. Don't buy this. A better movie would be friday, or poetic justice, or tyler perrys madea's family reunion.",1111017600,4,191,4.485714285714286
1876702,2,B00008ZZ6G,"This movie is awful.  There were a few (very few!) funny parts, but for the most part it was just plain idiotic.  The quality was even worse.  Looked like someone shot it on a cheap camcorder. Don't waste your time on this one.",1067904000,19,227,4.232558139534884

1876717,1,B00008ZZ6G,"1 star for effort -- and because it's the lowest possible rating.  A cheesy pastiche of stereotypes with boring dialogue, the thinnest possible storyline and far too few laughs.  Hokey acting and at times an almost painfully forced delivery of the lame lines provided.  This cinematic turd simply doesn't measure up to other black comedies.",1446940800,,340,5.1454545454545455

1876733,1,B00008ZZ6G,"I could only watch about 5-10 minutes of it. I could not take it. I don't mind watching a low budget movie and even poor acting but this one was an insult to my brain. I just could not take it. The ""funny"" parts were not funny at all and it was just plain stupid. Now I am giving my opinion only after a few minutes of watching and can't say how the whole movie was. I just didn't want to waste my time.

1876738,3,B00008ZZ6G,"Definitely not one of the better movies I've seen. Amusing at times, but very low budget. Acting wasn't even close to mediocre. Maybe worth a late night giggle or used as possible backround noise while cleaning.",1411948800,,211,4.888888888888889
