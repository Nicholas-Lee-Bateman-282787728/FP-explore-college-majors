8098676,4,B000CEV3PA,"The second volume of this lovely series is even better than the first. This DVD contains the next four episodes - Sleepless, Painless, Tearless, and Trustless. As Soubi refuses to tell Ritsuka why his older brother Seimei was killed Ritsuka loses trust in Soubi.  Ritsuka again sees his therapist, but keeps it a secret from his classmates and Soubi, as he wonders if he has any true friends and the meaning of friendship.

More ""battle units"" are deployed from Septimal Moon in an attempt to capture Ritsuka. After the attempts in the first DVD failed the unit Sleepless decide to use bribery by telling Ritsuka that he will find out about his brother's death if he joins them. While the cruel unit Zero, who have been created to feel no pain, use mind control on Ritsuka's teacher. Before they can use her for their purposes, Soubi accidently comes across them and battles them alone. With only a quarter of the strength of a normal unit, Soubi finds himself in serious trouble and facing physical attacks. Meanwhile, due to the bond that has already been created between them, Ritsuka begins to see visions of butterflies - being a representation of Soubi's need for help, but without knowing what they mean.

During these episodes we learn more about Soubi's past, the severe treatment he suffered as star pupil of Septimal Moon, and a darker side of him than previously seen. We also learn more about Youki's, Ritsuka's teacher and his therapist's feelings. The series becomes darker in this volume, so if you enjoyed the first volume, this is a ""must-buy.""",1146355200,7,1562,4.82089552238806
