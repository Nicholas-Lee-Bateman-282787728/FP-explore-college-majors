8014764,5,B0001ME5CQ,"I watched this movie the other night and was sitting on the edge of my seat all the way through it. This movie has alot of suspense and mystery to it that also has a very complex plot. Yes, this movie is very strange and wierd at times, but is also very enjoyable to view. The actors were very strong and the plot very deep. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a ""different type of movie"".",1171065600,,411,4.08641975308642
8014765,5,B0001ME5CQ,"This is a bizarre little underground film. Set in the 1970's in Salem, MA. Old friends search to uncover some hiddens secrets. The acting for a low budget film is excellent, and it looks like it cost a lot to make it, given that most films from The Asylum don't. John Doe rules, and I love the old guy Hobbes that was in the film Road Trip. Way cool.",1137715200,,350,4.086956521739131
8014766,3,B0001ME5CQ,"Coming from the usually graphically violent Asylum Films house, RED RIGHT HAND is more of a murder mystery with supernatural overtones.  A group of friends reunite for their fifteenth reunion, and we gather from their apprehension, all isn't well.  Seems like on the night of their graduation, one of their friends died under mysterious circumstances and the friends tried to cover the death up.  Some of the sexual dialogue borders on being laughable but the performances from  group of unknown actors are strong and the movie has a forboding sense of impending doom with a rather predictable dark ending.  A faster pace may have helped build better suspense, but it's much better than most of the films from this studio's catalogue.",1134864000,,734,5.033057851239669
8014767,5,B0001ME5CQ,"A high school reunion reveals a dark secret of a select cadre of attendees: That they have bloodied their hands with the corpse of a fellow student buried in the town. An interlocking web and past and present sexual relationships contributes another layer of sinisterness and amorlity to the story, which takes on a supernatural dimension as it progresses.

A superbly acted, sharply filmed psychological study of ordinary people confronted with encounters of the murkiest kind.",1091836800,,478,5.2894736842105265
