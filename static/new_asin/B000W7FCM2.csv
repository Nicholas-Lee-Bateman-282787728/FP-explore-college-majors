8221462,5,B000W7FCM2,"Like a low-fi horror version of Lar's Von Trier's ""The Five Obstructions"", director Mel House and his game cast manage to shine the large turd that is the long-running Witchcraft series to a golden gleam, while staying within the narrow confines of the tropes set forth by previous entries.

Cast standouts include Tim Wrobel as warlock with a heart of gold and libido of indiscriminate taste, Will Spanner and Zoe Hunter as the ""witch who keeps her clothes on"". Wrobel manages to get across Spanner's world-weariness even as he beds every witch in sight while Zoe displays deft comedic skill in a brief sequence where she receives ""help"" from a good Samaritan on a lonely Texas road. I suppose that Roxy Vandiver's athletic performance in one of the most methodical and varied sex scenes ever filmed deserves some mention, though it is hard to watch without hearing the less-than-subtle sound of jackhammers in the back of your mind.

Moving into the director's chair after handling DP duties on the Wolinski brother's previous effort, Mel House shows a flair for interesting camera work and a sense of pacing critical to genre films. Though sometimes falling short of the mark, his use of effects, both digital and practical, greatly enhance the look and feel of the picture. If he overreaches on occasion, it's only because his vision outpaces his budget (and sometimes his actors).

I've heard that his next project will be a completely original film and I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll do with a bigger budget and a greater degree of control.

A nice film to watch while devouring the heart of your loved one.",1523664000,,1623,4.869565217391305

8221464,3,B000W7FCM2,could have been better with a higher quality camera and more sound edits and acting that didn't sound like it was being read from the script,1514764800,,140,4.423076923076923

8221467,1,B000W7FCM2,"haven't seen a witchcraft series movie in a while so decided to check it out.  yikes!  ultra-low budget as the previous reviewer stated, but are the typical beautiful women in this dvd?  sorry to say, no.  not that i want to get insultive or anything, but the actresses, with the exception of one are very homely and unattractive.  it's like they went out and found some women to volunteer to do this movie for credit rolls or something.  bad acting, bad editing and horrible and i mean horrible lighting.  they used natural lighting and everything is super dark.  which is probably good since you don't want to see how bad this film really is.  i like the series nevertheless and will have to check out some others.",1268179200,6,716,4.574803149606299
8221468,3,B000W7FCM2,"Fans of the extemely low-budget Witchcraft franchise know what to expect: gorgeous women, desktop computer special effects, video cinematography that was not done with a hi-def Panavision Genesis camera, and clumsy editing that must have been done in a big hurry!  So Witchcraft 13 won't disappoint, and it gets down to business right away in the pre-title sequence: a beautiful girl in a tight white blouse and black cheerleader mini-skirt vigorously seducing a man before she rips out his heart.  (Or some hunk of rubber covered with goo that is supposed to be a heart)  Later there is another good sequence featuring a short-haired blonde witch in a skimpy white halter doing the same with the hero Will Spanner.  This film actually has some fairly smooth editing and adequate direction in spots.  The production values of this film are about the  same as that for Witchcraft 2, but who cares?  I'm ready for Witchcraft 14 and 15.",1201564800,11,933,4.904458598726115
