7826248,5,6302369096,"I bought the entire collection of this series, including the story of Joseph. I started with the David story and was arogantly going to return it as I wanted to give my then 2 year old only complete bible truth. So I went to my Bible and realized that I was basing my knowledge on the watered down versions of Bible stories from my childhood. There it was (in the book of Samuel)I was amazed at how acurate the series was. (The only one that had a slight error in it was the video on the Nativity but only because of the wisemen's visit to baby Jesus not at the manger. He was already living in a home which is why King Herod killed all babies under the age of two... but I believe the makers wanted to get the full story in the 20-30 minutes of the video... smile) The entire series is a great success and my daughter, now nine, still enjoys them and is a mini Bible Scholar. The Pastors are baffled with her Bible acuracy and comprehension. My hat goes off for the entire series! God Bless",1097366400,2,991,4.193717277486911
7826249,2,6302369096,"Aside from the less than best illustrations, the Joseph story itself in this telling takes second seat to the promotion of Bible reading today.  The three main characters are not the Biblical characters but three modern figures.  A female Biblical archaeologist, what may be her male assistant or colleague (he seems less knowledgeable), and a rather racistly portrayed side-kick in the form of a native Egyptian boy.  Little time is spent on the Joseph story, most of it focuses on his role after assession to power and less on his reasons for being in Egypt or the lesson is story is supposed to teach.",1003881600,7,604,4.788461538461538
