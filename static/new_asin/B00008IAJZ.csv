1847889,4,B00008IAJZ,"Any time I see a movie that portrays family members as bullies , it is hard to digest.  Family is supposed to be supportive and loving...in my opinion.  The world has lots of bad people in it and -Family -again in my opinion, should be loving and supportive, when it is not, it creates problems for the World.",1359590400,,309,4.310344827586207
1847890,5,B00008IAJZ,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. And I was not disappointed. He was wonderful in his role in this film (it was more like an extended appearance). He was a hero, once again. And I loved that. Karisma Kapoor was AMAZING!!! I was so impressed with her performance in this film!!! From the perspective of a mother, this film had some heart-wrenching moments. I enjoyed being able to look at and think about the way of life different people live. I liked being able to see the contrast of those living a western life-style and those who stick close to older, more traditional ways. It was interesting to me to contemplate how a violent way of life seemed to be the only way for some people to survive. This film made me think a lot, which I liked.",1334880000,4,766,4.289655172413793
1847891,2,B00008IAJZ,"Very disappointed with this dvd.  The quality was so bad it took away from the story especially when you have to use subtitles.  Had read another review before buying this dvd and that had said the quality was very bad I should have heeded their advice.  Also disappointed that Aishwarya Rai  only appeared in a dream sequence where she only looked sexy while dancing such a waste of a good actress in such a second rate role.  Her role only lasted a minute so I take it the producers of this film only used her as a draw card.  Do not buy this dvd if you are expectly to see Aishwarya Rai acting, well its hard to see anything really because of the bad film quality and reducing the size of the screen does not improve it one iota.",1305072000,,732,4.23021582733813
1847892,1,B00008IAJZ,"Powerful perhaps; the movie is a domino effect of terrible, unbelievable choices that lead to the deaths of far too many primary characters. Simple cinematic transitions end up being over-dramatized five minute segments. Two hours into the movie, you'll be asking yourself: where's Shahrukh? The answer is not worth the wait.",1276905600,,325,5.392156862745098
1847893,3,B00008IAJZ,"This movie plays the ""power"" of love against the ""power"" of fear. Karisma delivers an excellent performance, and Shahrukh does want he normally does so well- he entertains. The dance scene with him and Aishwayra is mind-blowing and packed with energy. It alone is enough reason to see and buy the movie. All the supporting cast were purely incredible as well. This film is a total package: a little bit of drama, a little bit of action and a little bit of comedy.",1259884800,3,463,4.590361445783133
1847894,5,B00008IAJZ,"A wonderful movie, but you have to be patient.  In the beginning, you cannot figure out what is happening, things seem comical, up and down & quite lighthearted.  Before you complete your viewing you will be ""Totally Shocked"", Horrified, Mystified, & Enlightened(culturally).

The actors in this movie are amazing & play their parts extremely well, including the youngest member of the cast.  This entire movie had me glued from beginning to end.

You will experience: comedy, murder, liberation, chauvinism, Feminism, Eastern Culture, Western Culture, War, Peace, Cruelty, Kindness, Weakness, Strength, Heroes & so much more...............

1847895,5,B00008IAJZ,"This film is intense and very riveting. I enjoyed every moment and did not know what to expect next. This movie really champions the power of the woman. I see why it is named Shakti. I originally bought this movie mainly because Shakti is my daughter's name and it is great for her to see her name as the title of a film. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I geniunely enjoyed the film as well. Of course, I routinely watch Hindi films because I love the singing, the romance, the adventure and how much is put into each film. I think the plot and story line is very good and one worth watching.",1236556800,5,600,4.226086956521739
1847896,4,B00008IAJZ,"ON THE WHOLE SHAKTHI THE POWER ROCKS! THE FILM HAS A HARD HIITING STORYLINE,SUPERB MUSIC AND NOTEWORTHY PERFORMENCES.

  NANA PATEKAR IS FANTASTIC!

  SANJAY KAPOOR IS VERY GOOD

  KRISHMA KAPOOR CARRIES THE FILM ON HER SHOULDERS.

  SRK SHAHRUKH KHAN ROCKS IN A CAMEO.

  A MUST BUY.",1143072000,10,284,5.0
1847897,4,B00008IAJZ,This is an excellent movie if you are into feminism and can get past the gory details.  It is quite a powerful movie and Karisma has really proved herself as an actress in this movie.  It's about a mother's fight for her child.  Nana Patekar and Sanjay Kapoor also star in this jam-packed film.  It's definitely a must see for any women (as well as any daring men).,1107907200,13,365,4.323529411764706

7984399,5,B00008IAJZ,"Good
Shakthi (The Power) Is a Action and Drama movie, very good powerful, lovely story of a wife who visits her husband family in India and finds herself in the middle of a frustration civil battle.
Shah Rukh Khan was my favorite in the movie Ishq Kameena is my all time favorite song :)",1425340800,,287,4.333333333333333
7984400,2,B00008IAJZ,"Liked Ms. Kapoor's acting. Thought the storyline  was very disjointed. Could not understand how the dream/ dance sequence helped advance the plot of the movie. SRK 's cameo role was heroic ( as usual)  and may have helped the movie along, but not much. I am a loyal  fan of SRK but feel that this movie was a waste of his outstanding acting abilities.",1419465600,,351,4.453125

7984403,1,B00008IAJZ,"Weird characters trapped in an unbelievable plot set in an imaginary medieval land, spewing foul language and engaging in gory bloodshed. Pure junk. All you feel is revulsion, disbelief, annoyance, and anger -  not entertaining at all. I practically watched the movie in 'fast-forward', it was that bad. I am surprised why Sharukh decided to take this movie for what seems like a guest or supportive role. Or Karishma for that matter, for her character does nothing but yell and cry, half the time covered in tomato ketchup.",1401148800,,524,4.954545454545454
7984404,5,B00008IAJZ,"Great movie and Shah Rukh Khan is at his most mischievious, daring, macho, adorable, honorable self. Even though he is not in the movie through-out it, he has a pivotal role. Great dance scene with him and Aishwarya.",1394409600,3,216,4.7105263157894735
7984405,4,B00008IAJZ,"Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor) and Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) are friends living in Canada with their two uncles. Shekhar proposes to Nandini and she says yes and now they have a young son named Raja. Shekhar hears breaking news of violence in India, the family journeys to his ancestral house in rural North-East State of India and Nandini is shocked to see that Shekhar's family is embroiled in feudal gang wars. Shekhar's father Narasimha (Nana Patekar) has many enemies.

Shekhar tries to bring peace between the warring gangs, but is attacked by the rival gang & killed on way to a reconciliatory meeting that he wanted to attend on his father's behalf. Nandini feels insecure and decides to leave India with her son but Narasimha imprisons them. But as she is desperate to escape, she goes on a difficult journey to return to her home in Canada with the help of Shekhar's mother and sister but when she leaves the house Narasimha sets his men on them.

Aishwarya Rai only has a small bit part.  She danced in a song video. It's nice, and definately very sexy, but they didn't need it to sell this otherwise great film. I'd enjoy this film even if they left her out.

Meanwhile Nandini and Raja meet drifter Jaisingh (Shahrukh Khan) who helps them board a train to Jaipur but dies while battling Narsimha's men. Back at Narasimha's house, his wife revolts against him, telling him to put a stop to the bloodshed and let Nandini leave. Later when Nandini and Raja are about to check-in at the airport, Narasimha comes and bids them goodbye and lets them fly back to Canada.

This film was both frightening and educating about the warped sense of humanity in other countries.",1371945600,2,1669,4.7020547945205475
