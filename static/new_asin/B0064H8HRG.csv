If you've ever visited San Francisco or live and or grew up in San Francisco,or if you have visited The Cliff House Restaurant and wondered what those ruins to the north were, this DVD will amaze you. See Sutro Baths in all it's glory. From construction all the way to it's demise, it's entire history is covered through footage and photos, most of which have never been seen previously. I highly recommend this DVD!",1321660800,8,446,4.5875
8492597,5,B0064H8HRG,"This is a wonderful video showing film and archival footage from Sutro's Museum, which I visited while growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Tragically, the museum burned in the early 1960's. Considering ,all of the wondrous treasures it held, it was a cultural and historic loss as well. Sutro's Baths had been rebuilt a number of times. Both it and the museum are gone forever, brought back to life only in this incredible DVD....I'd been searching for this type of documentation for many years. Any and all who had a chance to visit either (or both!) of these gems will find themselves quite taken when they are able to have their own copy. I strongly recommend this DVD.",1427932800,,679,4.658333333333333
8492598,5,B0064H8HRG,Excellent history of Sutro's - I skated there from 1960 - until the last skating session in 1966. I was interviewed for this film - had a great turnout at the Surf Theater in San Francisco.,1427414400,,189,4.277777777777778
8492599,4,B0064H8HRG,"A native San Franciscan, I spent many a year on the ice rink at Sutro's.  The pools were there in my grandparent's time.  My children and I watched it burn to the ground one afternoon..  It broke my heart.  If you are an older San Franciscan, this will bring back a lot of memories.  If you are younger, it will give you a glimpse of the City at the turn of the century and into the 60s.",1394064000,2,387,3.9740259740259742
8492600,5,B0064H8HRG,I am old enough to have experienced some of Sutro's Buildings at Lands End but we never went there when I was growing up.  I have a total fascination for the whole area and wished I could have seen the buildings before they burned down.  I go to the Cliff House as often as I can and love it!  This video was very interesting and informative.  I would definitely recommend it.,1389225600,,376,4.253521126760563
8492601,4,B0064H8HRG,"My parents took me there when I was growing up.  I had never been to a place like that before so it made a lasting impression.  We didn't live in San Francisco, so we didn't visit often.  It was a favorite place of mine and I have thought of it often through the years.  This DVD helped me relive a lot of those wonderful memories.",1373155200,,331,4.046153846153846
8492602,5,B0064H8HRG,This was everything I hoped it would be. It was a gift that delighted the person I gave it to and it continues to delight.,1362873600,,122,3.92
8492603,3,B0064H8HRG,"This Dvd was ok,but started to get boring with the same two guys talking and going over and over the same thing for an hour. The Sutros Baths were and still are a sight to behold --- deserving of more film footage of the indoor sights of it all --- and there were thousands of things to see there. I can only hope that there really are more films and photos in the archives somewhere,yet to be seen.",1348876800,2,399,4.128205128205129
8492604,5,B0064H8HRG,I am of the age to have enjoyed the original wonder in San Francisco. I was not sure I wanted to waste time in a model setup but what a pleasent surprise! This trip down memory lane is worth the effort and time to visit. Not to miss if you want to capture memories or just wonder what all the noise was about by those who actually were there and enjoyed it all at the time.,1347840000,,373,3.9210526315789473
8492605,4,B0064H8HRG,"The history of San Francisco's legendary Sutro Baths is quickly told. Built in the 1890s by Silver Rush magnate Adolph Sutro, this natatorium/amusement park/museum/swim stadium/gathering place was 3-1/2 acres of entertainment under one roof. Sutro even built his own railroad to transport the public to the 7 pools with 517 private dressing rooms, and then died 2 years after it opened. The Baths were never profitable and were passed down to various descendants before being sold in the 1950s. Many attempts were made over the years (including the addition of ice skating in 1937) to update/remodel and restore dwindling attendance before meeting its final demise in a 1966 fire. Today the ruins are part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and there has been an exponential growth in recent interest, beginning with Marilyn Blaisdell's San Francisciana books published in the late 1980s.

Sutro's: The Palace at Lands End, written and directed by Tom Wyrsch, is the documentary you've been waiting for if you have even the slightest interest in the subject. Interviews with historians James Smith and John Martini, as well as a number of attendees/collectors/artists tell the entire astounding story from the 1890s to the 1960s. Even if you've never been to San Francisco, this lost architectural masterpiece with its Greek temple entrance, stained glass windows, 100,000 square foot crystal glass roof, and a museum ""on steroids"" will truly captivate. Your local YMCA/health club will seem puny and paltry in comparison, and the huge (hundreds) photo collection and ancient private footage (both b&w and color, including the final 2 fires) allow this film's viewer to see Sutro Baths in all its immensity. The interviewees talk of being overwhelmed and ""mass bedlam"". There was so much to see and do over the years: restaurants, theatres, bands, orchestras, the Sky Tram, even an early 1960s ghost story. Today the mysterious ruins still resonate with ""the sublime energy"" of a time gone by, and it's hard to believe a place like this ever existed. Signage informing ""do so at their own risk"", and burned-out wreckage being bulldozed over a cliff edge (imagine the environmental furor) are just not seen in today's Age of Entitled Petulance.

This DVD is definitely recommended, but a few qualms must be voiced. At 85 minutes, we're given almost too much of a good thing, and there's a long digression covering the arcade and automata of the Musee Mecanique. This will be fascinating for collectors, but too much time is spent away from Sutro Baths: 10 minutes could have been trimmed without lessening the impact. There is also an issue regarding the sound mixing: a vast discrepancy between the interviews/narration (quiet) and the soundtrack music (1890s ragtime piano music - much louder) might lead some viewers to continuously adjust the volume. The only bonus on the disc is a brief slide show of recent photos from the ruins site. Otherwise, there is much to enjoy here for both San Francisco nostalgists as well as for lost architecture buffs.",1347494400,,3064,5.11377245508982
