7922075,2,B00004STVC,I didn't like this film at all. I'm sorry that I had purchased it. Once I saw where this was going I was no longer interested. A film like this no one I have to say that I would not recommend this one. But I'm sure some people of that kind of spirit probably would enjoy it.,1384732800,,274,3.824561403508772
7922076,4,B00004STVC,I enjoyed this film because it starred Tim Roth.  His character was quite interesting.  It was a quite unusual film and would not be to everyone's taste.,1361664000,,153,4.62962962962963
7922077,5,B00004STVC,"This movie was so awesome and the seller was very good. The acting was great by all but Tim Roth really shines over everyone else. Very sexy, and exciting. Please remember that it is a VHS and the picture and sound quality are reflective of that fact, but please don't let that stop you from acting asap to make the perfect husband part of you're movie collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!  caution this may produce urges of a sexual nature,"" and a fan is recommended.  ""ENJOY""",1252022400,,478,4.678571428571429
7922078,4,B00004STVC,"One star away from being a masterpiece.  Tim Roth was the least-convincing person in the film, playing a wealthy gigolo artist and sex-love addict whose trysts with married women gets him into endless duels with insulted husbands.  That part was a tad corny for me.  However, the music, the sets, the costumes and the basic Dostoevsky story were superb.  I couldn't wait to see what luscious scene or hat or gown would show up next.  My favorite was the flower-forest wallpaper at the spa.",1239148800,,491,4.7976190476190474
7922079,3,B00004STVC,"Having just viewed this film, I must say it makes for a pleasent evening's viewing. Revolving around two freinds Milian (Tim Roth), a gifted pianist and notorious womanizer, and Franz (Peter Firth), the manager of a luxery  spa, who meet again after seven years. Set in 1900, the story opens with  Milan having been challanged to a duel after he attempts to seduce the wife  of a Military Officer. Milan wins the duel, his 29th by shooting the  officer in the behind. Meanwhile we first see Franz aboard a train with a  little girl where he throws a dog off after it's owner throws his pipe out  the window. The meeting of the two invokes memories in Milan of a long ago  summer and fall when he first met Franz at a spa and the two quickly become  freinds. Milan also falls for Franz's lovely wife Therese (Ana Belen), but  she at first repulses his advances. A three way freindship soon develops  however, much like that in Truffauts Jules and Jim, culminateing in the  trio having a fully clothed swim party in the spa's pool. After this point,  Therese and Milan's illicit affair heats up behind Franz's back and we see  it unfold in the flashbacks that are interspersed with the main action.  Although Franz makes no outward sign, Milan begins to suspect the other man  knows about the affair and has waited seven years to seek revenge. But  neither he or the viewer are really sure about this, or if the little girl  is the product of the long ago affair until the films final moments. If you  like period dramas that carry you along with the story, then A PERFECT  HUSBAND is a must for your film library.",960508800,23,1612,4.496551724137931
