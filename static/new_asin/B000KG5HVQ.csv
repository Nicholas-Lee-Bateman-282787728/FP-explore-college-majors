8156328,5,B000KG5HVQ,"This is the BEST Sports DVD on Speed on the market today. The most extensive and innovative speed training video ever produced. It dissect each move to its very basic to its most complicated aspect. All the exercises as athletes clearly demonstrate every drill, as verbal explanations are given to why, and how of every concept. It is not a DVD for Throwers, not for Jumpers. It is definitely an instructional speed training DVD for Runners and Sprinters. It gives you a plan to follow. One can easily understand the exercise or drills for a beginner, an intermediate, and advance. It offers several drills and variations for developing speed, agility, and quickness.  Great for coaches, young athletes, and parents who want the right techniques to help the athletes to gain speed in either basketball, running, sprinting, football, or soccer.",1428883200,,843,5.0647482014388485
8156329,2,B000KG5HVQ,"I read several human kinetics book and I was very satisfied with knowledge and information in them. So I had some expectation on human kinetics dvd. I bought this one for test, if it is OK I will buy all of their dvds. I did not found almost any new or interesting information here in this dvd. In any book aboot speed you will find much much more. The level is low, and the content is 95% only running speed and 100% leg, but nothing new here. Jumping speed,leg movement speed or kicking speed or any other speed in sport is even not mentioned. So the title is totaly wrong, and content is imho low level. For me, result is that I will not buy any other human kinetics dvd, it is not even close to the level of their books.

Today,(Aug. 2008) I opened a ""Training for speed, agility and quickness"" book(with included DVD) also from human kinetics. It is much better and more complete product than this DVD, and recomend it highly.",1214179200,3,931,4.350574712643678
