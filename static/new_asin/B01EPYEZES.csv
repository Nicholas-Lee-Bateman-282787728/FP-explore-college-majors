7739330,4,B01EPYEZES,I own both gem glow and the return and i am surprised that they don't have all the episodes. Season 1 has 52 episodes both DVDs have 24. I didn't notice until i finished both because it didn't seem right. i noticed some episodes were missing but thought maybe i wasn't paying attention. I love this show but if you really want to watch all episodes youll have to find them elsewhere. Other than that the quality is great. The feels are real. <3,1475020800,6,444,4.2976190476190474
7739331,2,B01EPYEZES,"The DVD is missing various episodes.
It has a few, such as 25, 26, and 28, but is missing 27 and 29-34.
Not worth it if you want to see the entire season.",1474934400,2,154,3.696969696969697

7739333,5,B01EPYEZES,"Steven Universe is an absolutely beautiful series, simple & colorful animation mixed with quality writing and emotional depth and maturity unseen in nearly anything else on television.  I truly hope Cartoon Network releases proper season sets soon!",1473638400,,248,5.702702702702703
7739334,2,B01EPYEZES,"For some reason, rather that collecting this episodic, story-driven series into Seasons DVDs as anyone with sense might, Cartoon Network has seen fit to create this mess. In a series that actually tells a story, this kind of random episode collection makes no sense and only enrages. Avoid this.",1473638400,59,295,5.040816326530612
7739335,5,B01EPYEZES,Awesome!!!!!!!,1472688000,,14,14.0

7739341,5,B01EPYEZES,Steven Universe is a wonderful show that people of all ages can enjoy. The humor and songs are very entertaining and the reason this show has become a cult favorite.,1468972800,,165,4.533333333333333
7739342,5,B01EPYEZES,"MINOR SOUND ISSUE: There is a minor sound issue with the DVD, the opening song starts out super quiet on ""WE"" and quickly returns to proper volume on the next few words on almost every episode.

As to the content, this is a great collection of mostly plot heavy episodes and a long over due addition to Steven Universe on home video. I'd still love actual season collections with all episodes rather than the themed sets that have come out so far, but these really are some of the best episodes with a lot of rewatchability. If you like Steven Universe, or are trying to get someone else interested in the show this a great DVD to get.",1466553600,,635,4.38135593220339
7739343,5,B01EPYEZES,"Please, make a season DVD for Steven Universe. We would love that more than a theme DVD with out of order episodes. If the product is bought a ton, maybe they will consider a season DVD. Please buy.",1466294400,2,198,4.2368421052631575
7739344,5,B01EPYEZES,Steven Universe is always a great purchase no regrets here!!!!,1465862400,,62,5.3
7739345,5,B01EPYEZES,"Psst, Hey, Cartoon Network? Can you please just release the episodes on DVD in order, and not skip over things? The show drops little hints in each episode, and if you play them out of order (or not at all), things can get confusing for newcomers!

OTHER THAN THAT: Awesome show, with awesome plot and complex characters. Would recommend for anyone, of any age. Please support this show!",1465430400,19,387,4.6911764705882355
7739346,5,B01EPYEZES,My daughter was very excited! It was a nice surprise gift!,1465430400,,58,4.363636363636363
7739347,2,B01EPYEZES,"Cartoon Network keeps splicing the show up into these horrid little theme DVDs instead of giving us an actual season.  I refuse to ""buy"" platform locked digital copies of episodes (I'm old enough to have seen more than one ""backbone of the internet"" close its doors to waste money on a virtual collection that can go away at any time), so if I want to show this series to someone my only choices are to buy a dozen of these theme discs and swap the DVD out every 10 minutes to get the right episode, or use a pirated fan-created ROM burned to disk?

No thanks, these things can all sit on the store shelf collecting dust.  If its not a full season set, its not worth buying for me.",1465257600,30,681,4.223076923076923

7739349,5,B01EPYEZES,I love this show I've seen all the episodes at least 5 times and I'm in love I pray to the DVD or blu Ray gods that this comes out on complete series! This show has a shockingly good storyline and the songs... Oh my god the songs! You feel like you've grown to the characters please watch this show!,1462492800,17,299,4.0

8759376,5,B01EPYEZES,"While it obviously isn't the whole season, the episodes contained are really great! I hope CN releases the season boxsets someday, and I think they will. But I definitely recommend buying this DVD until then.",1498348800,,208,4.9714285714285715
