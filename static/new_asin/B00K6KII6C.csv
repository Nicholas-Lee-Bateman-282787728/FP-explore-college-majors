6403804,3,B00K6KII6C,"LADY L is a film about an octogenarian aristocrat (Sophia Loren) who reminisces about her steamy life as lover of an anarchist (Paul Newman) and wife of the sophisticated David Niven. The film has a lot of great scenery and a thoroughly competent cast but not much of a story.
Loren's husband Carlo Ponti is the producer. Peter Ustibov is the director and screenwriter. The film is based on a novel by Romain Gary. The supporting cast includes Cecil Parker, Claude Dauphin, Philippe Noiret and Michel Piccoli.",1062201600,10,509,4.862068965517241
6403805,5,B00K6KII6C,"This movie is so ""nutty"" that you are laughing the whole time... Paul Newman and Sophia Loren sizzle the screen! A great movie with a humdinger of an ending!
The movie is about eclectic Lady Louise. A friend wants to write her biography and she is delighted, but boy is the friend in for a surprise... she takes him to her summer home and tells her life story, ending it with a shocking revelation. A very good movie.",1056412800,14,417,4.358974358974359

6403807,5,B00K6KII6C,"There were supposedly numerous attempts by screenwriters and possible directors to make a movie out of Romain Gary's wonderful book, ""Lady L.""  Carlo Ponti, Sophia's husband, wisely allowed Peter Ustinov (""Billy Budd"") a try and he turned the whole very complicated story into one of Sophia Loren's triumphs and cast opposite her in this are Paul Newman and David Niven, both giving wonderful performances.  The picture is so successful in Ustinov's hands as screenwriter and director, it is hard to imagine it being any better.  The film was made in Eastmancolor and Panavision and the MGM 1965 release is presented on DVD by Warner Archive, although the color is faded in certain scenes that distract you from thinking what you are watching, the music, art direction, photography, costume design and make-up, is perfect.  A triumph all around, does the book justice.  Needs to be seen multiple times.",1436486400,12,902,5.108843537414966

8656344,4,B00K6KII6C,Love the movie but the on demand Quality Control isnt. We are missing about 10 minutes in the middle. I plan on calling Warner Brothers Archives for a replacement since there is not an easy way to do that with Amazon. Delivered on time but the dvd recording quality was a fail.,1531612800,,277,4.346153846153846

8656350,3,B00K6KII6C,"This is one of those movies for people who like quirkiness for quirkiness's sake.  Quite honestly not my thing.  Much of the humor is of the sort that I think of as particularly appealing to the British because it challenges long-standing social mores, etc., etc., in which British society once abounded and perhaps still does.  This sort of thing doesn't really hold up over time because the long-standing social mores concerned have already vanished.  David Niven's character, Duke L, is the most interesting and has the best lines, with perhaps even a hint of Oscar Wilde.  Sophia's Loren's character is simply an opportunist with no real center.  Armand, the supposed French anarchist played by Paul Newman is more of a conceit than a character.  Newman's American-ness is exaggerated by the fact that he's the only person in the film without a European accent.  Perhaps a low point for Newman.  It's a very pretty cinemascope movie with gorgeous clothes and interior sets.  I kind of wish I hadn't bought it but will keep it in my library as a bit of a curiosity.",1453507200,,1068,4.818681318681318
8656351,5,B00K6KII6C,"I Have Absolutely No Idea What This Movie Is About. But, Sophia Loren is 115 in the shade.

Sophia Loren, God's example of a perfect woman. Zero defects.

Even though I really didn't understand the movie, I enjoyed it very much. David Nevin was a pleasure to watch also.  Very glad to have this movie in my Blu-ray/DVD collection.

I was a little disappointed because the movie was burned, rather than pressed. But, I will take what I can get. Buy this movie while you still can.  The video and audio quality was superb.",1451520000,,520,4.48936170212766
8656352,5,B00K6KII6C,Lady L starring Sophia Loren was released in 1966. It is one of her best comedies. Paul Newman provides good support. Fans  of Sophia Loren will like this the most.,1449878400,,164,4.466666666666667
8656353,5,B00K6KII6C,Paul Newman is wonderful!! As always! I love that this movie once again shows his great talent. It was actually one I had not seen and I really enjoyed it.,1445558400,,155,4.2
