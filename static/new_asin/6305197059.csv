984156,5,6305197059,"I saw this on cable years ago.  It's funny, sweet, touching -- I was blown away and forced friends to watch who ended up loving it as well!  It has its message but it earns the right to convey it by being massively entertaining.  GOOD STUFF!",1221350400,,241,4.195652173913044
984157,5,6305197059,This is a charming and emotional little short about a subject matter that all teens really should see.  I'd swear this film was a biography of my own life.  Even the story's character shares my name.  Definitely a must see.,1131235200,4,223,4.525
984158,5,6305197059,"Get out the tissues and prepare to laugh.  This short film was excellently written, directed and produced!  So many people believed in this project and I see why.
This film is saving lives!  It's teaching so many adults about what children go through in their young lives.  It tells the story but doesn't make it heavy with depressing moments but lightens things up with humor.  I cried at the end because of the joy I felt yet the sadness I felt as well because I knew that many children are still suffering today.
This should be a requirement for EVERYONE to see!",1058832000,12,565,4.5
984159,5,6305197059,"This was an enjoyable short film. The acting was very good and the story was well told. It's an up-lifting story that will make you smile and feel great. It's sweet and gives you a story that many will relate to about being or feeling out of place and looking for acceptance. It is fairly short, about 16 minutes of actual movie with an additional 5 minutes of introduction. I recommend this as a solid addition to your video collection because it's unusual and done very well. It is clean enough for mixed crowds of all ages. A good tool for enlightening narrow minds.",1046217600,17,569,4.480769230769231
984160,3,6305197059,The movie made a good point. But it was only 30 min or so for this film. and not enought move time for the money I payed.,1043107200,7,121,3.5185185185185186
984161,4,6305197059,"I saw Trevor in a film class at UCLA and it had everyone laughing hard.  I loved the humorous approach it had to the taboo subject of homosexuality.  To me, it was reminiscent of All in the Family's comedic presentation of  difficult topics such as racism.  Although the film was great, I still  cannot give it 5 stars simply because I believe only a handful of films  ever created deserve such reverence.  It was entertaining and touching,  nonetheless.  And definitely worth viewing time and again.  Enjoy.",939859200,48,508,4.8023255813953485

984339,2,6305197059,"I bought this movie on Amazon, but I couldn't wait to watch it, so I saw it on YouTube. I'm too sure what to think of this. I mean, we're talking about a young boy with unrequited feelings for another boy (which is not unusual, if kept to oneself) whose relationship with his parents seem strained (and haven't we all had difficulties getting along with family members), who spends his free time either listening to Diana Ross records (in an obsessive manner, I may add) or writing a diary (which is read and shared by others), and after a halfhearted suicide attempt (as a result of other people finding out of his homosexual inclination) is able to get tickets to see Ms. Ross at a concert (not a problem-solving fix, to say the least). All I was able to get from watching this short was confirmation of homosexual stereotypes, which in my opinion really does no justice to the homosexual. But since I like the music of Ms. Ross, I'll add one more star to this rating than I find necessary.",1464307200,,992,4.486187845303867

7884797,4,6305197059,"OMG. A Water Bearer film that didn't totally suck. Usually I HATE all their films. I can't believe the few reviews that gave this poor ratings. Good Lord, it is a very short film, not an expensive budgeted mini-series. Cute story about growing up knowing you are gay and different. May every boy who knows he is gay isn't as feminine as this boy, but I think everyone who knew they were gay as a boy could identify with some parts of this film. Great job.",1523491200,,455,4.3023255813953485
7884798,4,6305197059,"Not bad, but you can die from too much aspirin. I've struggled with being gay for much of my life. For me, I was so brainwashed and surrounded by hardcore Christians that I didn't even know what gay was until I was an adult. I just knew I was different. Due to brainwashing, I even tried being who I wasn't. I found a woman, dated her, and married her. Of course, it didn't last. For anyone wondering, there is nothing you can do to change who you are. Accept yourself and be proud. Those around you may or may not accept that you're gay, but it doesn't matter. Suicide is not the answer. I tried once and failed, and I'm very glad I did. Things do get better after high-school. Hang in there, find people to talk to. School is but a small part of your life. There is so much to see, so much to do, so much to experience.",1519689600,,821,4.105590062111801

7884804,5,6305197059,"I was laughing from the very first moments of this little film. I grew up knowing I was different but wasn't sure how or why. I was teased by family and others and it took me years before I could accept myself as this young Trevor has. I can totally relate to his journey and love the way this film presents this issue. I think of how this could have been a tragedy had Trevor chosen a different method for his ""final solution"" and how many lives have been senselessly lost when one has reached the end of their rope. But hope springs eternal and you can find self-acceptance and find that not all the world is against us. Twenty minutes well spent.",1487721600,,649,4.284552845528455

7884806,1,6305197059,"I take exception to the main theme in this DVD that such a young boy has already determined his sexual preference, as implied by the misguided term sexual orientation.  A young boy entering puberty will have many experiences and emotions that can be homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual inter alia.  As he matures and comes of age, the final decision about his sexuality will arrive.  Today there is too much pressure from the standard bearers of LBGT and Political Correctness on such young adolescents as the one portrayed in this DVD.  This is a very complex subject and advocacy in itself is no solution.",1485734400,,606,4.911764705882353
