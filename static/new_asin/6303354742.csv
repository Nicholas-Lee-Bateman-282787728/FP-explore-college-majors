630441,5,6303354742,"Bette midler never greater , doing dramatic scenes , singing on stage live as two personae , herself and Janis Joplin.

630481,3,6303354742,"The Rose, 1979 film

This drama was inspired by the life of Janis Joplin, whose career was cut short by liquor and drugs (like other show business performers). She seemed more like a screamer than a singer, but some liked her. The use of drugs and whiskey are a lethal combination especially when self-administered. She traded in all her tomorrows for just one yesterday. They show an argument because of her schedule, she cant take time out. Not having regular hours can interfere with sleep patterns, then its pills and stimulants to compensate. The other danger is just being on tour. Hank Williams, Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, Eddie Cochrane, Otis Redding and others died on tour. Then there are the irregular meals. How many popular singers are still on tour (or popular) after they pass forty? The drop in popularity led to a longer life for Jerry Lee Lewis and others.

I don't know how accurate this story is, drama is needed for an entertaining popular movie. Some singers are popular because they speak for what many feel but cant express. But there can be a danger in that. Barry McGuire sang The Eve of Destruction and saw his career stifled by an Establishment who didn't appreciate the lyrics. In an earlier age Joe Hill paid a heavy price for his parodies of popular songs. The career of Chuck Berry was also squelched. Or popular tastes change; the Beach Boys were eclipsed by The Beatles and other bands (who had a new sound for a fickle public). Some popular singers from the late 1960s are still played on classic rock stations. Just enjoy this story about a singer who burned out before her time.

Drugs, sex, and rock and roll are not a formula for a healthy life; theres always a price tag. Can the problems of being a popular singer be avoided? Only in so far as their work resembles a regular job. Touring is necessary to sell records or albums to fans who want a souvenir of their attendance at a performance. When sales increase others will follow, like peer pressure from advertising. The scenes tell about the business of popular singing. Is it still that way? Would you want a relative or friend to live that kind of life? Burning the candle at both ends? You could point to Hendrix or Morrison as examples. Know of more recent examples? Rose and her driver have trouble at a diner. We don't serve hippies here. I never eat them.

The late 1960s showed political conflicts that didn't occur in earlier decades (as far as I know). Rose seems to be searching for popular approval of fame. Is this a wise choice? If you do the right thing you shouldnt worry about popular approval since many people will criticize you no matter what. The basic measure is still the bottom line, however measured. Is it better to be rich or famous? You may not be able to have both (or either). At times the movie runs on too long. Roses promoter finally decides he had enough of her misconduct and fires her; she is quite upset by this rejection. Rose decides to go to Mexico, they visit a bar. The ending shows Rose performing before a huge audience. Then she collapses on stage! Its lights out for her.

This movie has a lesson about the personality defects of a popular singer. What will you learn from it?",1464825600,,3218,4.570190641247834

Bette Middler is an effervescent and untiring actress who most definitely poured her heart and soul into this movie. Her acting is ""Bette"" and her singing and performance spotlights her tremendous singing and performing abilities along with acting. I can not think of a better person to portray this small bit of Janis Joplin's life. This moving is not only entertaining, but takes you to the 60's/70's and exposes you to a capsule of time.",1437696000,2,535,4.702127659574468

She does not sing in this movie. She screams, and screams and screams. If you took a pair of metal claws and scraped them across a blackboard, you would be getting close to the sound of her screaming. There's a bar scene where she performs with a bunch of cross dressers.....the scene is sheer agony.....thank god for the mute button. If this is at all representative of how she performs in real life, how she ever became famous is one one the wonders of the world!.

Whoever said the movie labors on because it shows too much concert footage, obviously does not enjoy Bette's talent, nor Janis Joplin' style music nor music in general> There was the PERFECT amount of singing and concert footage in it. If you want to pick on a movie that went on too long with concert footage.. try watching Oliver Stone's, ""The Doors""!

I understand oh too well what happens when you let pressures YOU create (and those around you) run you ragged. When we do not honor our bodies and our need for rest, healing, and balance, we, especially as women, lose touch with our wombs ( our intuition and cocreative capacites) our gentle yin energy. We get so far off balance that sometimes we can never regain balance. This was so well acted and so real. I was very angry at the axxxxxxx who gave her the bag as a present. You never give anyone you love a bag. It makes me sick. Anyway, now i have to figure out where I can check it out or watch it for less than amazons $30",1417824000,,1070,4.270935960591133

Well, my husband I bought the DVD--which arrived quickly, and in absolutely perfect condition, even though listed as used--and watched it.  I can tell you that it was no more fit for me to watch at 40-something than it was for me to watch at 8 years old.  I have to hand it to my Mother, who protected me from the trauma of watching The Rose at a young age.  So much for ""knowing better"" than Mom now that I'm a ""grown up.""

My issues with the movie are that it is depressing, the acting is not good, and they failed at making me believe that the events happened in the 60s.",1402617600,2,817,4.006172839506172

631004,5,6303354742,"Great Movie, Loved the Story and Bette Midler Played such an amazing part in this movie. Such a sad ending!",1380326400,,107,4.4
631005,3,6303354742,"I finally got to see ""The Rose"" (1979) last night. It's a sad tale of a Janis Joplin-like rock star, Mary Rose Foster (Bette Midler), who desperately wants to take a break from the rock 'n' roll train, but her manager (Alan Bates) won't let her due to business obligations.

It's not all sad though. The film plays-out like a docudrama with quite a bit of lively concert footage. If you like this style of rock (guitar/horns/etc.) you'll like the movie more than I did. The Rose falls for a limo driver (Fredric Forrest) and they have some misadventures, mostly at bars and other places of the night, like a drag queen show. The plot culminates in The Rose' ""coming home"" gig at her hometown in Florida.

Bette is passionate in the role, but I was never a fan. Nor do I dislike her; I'm neutral. The role calls for a lot of hysteria because that's the rock star lifestyle, at least it was in that era, 1970. As such, the film's really over-the-top. If you can't stomach a lot of hysterical scenes I'd suggest staying away.

I prefer 1991's ""The Doors"", which has the same theme, but is about a real individual, Jim Morrison, and contains more recognizable (better) music.

BOTTOM LINE: Unless you like Bette Midler and the style of music, this movie won't likely trip your trigger. It's the story of a rock star who needs a break but can't get it, so she goes totally out of control. It's ""sex, drugs and Rock 'n' roll,"" but it's mostly alcohol and rock 'n' roll -- music, alcohol, bars, music, alcohol, bars, repeat to the end. That's the movie. I'm skipping something, but I don't want to give it away; it should be obvious anyway.

631135,5,6303354742,"Even though it clocks in at two hours and fifteen minutes, I wish ""The Rose"" went on longer with the complete musical numbers that appear on the soundtrack album. The story and acting are great in themselves, but when Bette gets onstage as Rose, it's electric! It's almost easy to forget she's playing a fictional character (though based on Joplin), Midler's performance is so committed and raw. You can see she's giving everything she's got.

So many great scenes in this from Rose being humiliated by the ""hillbillies"" to the rousing performance at the gay bar (look for the late Sylvester as Diana Ross and late Michael Greer as the MC/Baby Jane Hudson) and Rose's homecoming in the dive bar where she got her start. Alan Bates' performance as the driving, unsympathetic manager will make you despise him and Frederic Forrest is likeable as the chauffer/AWOL Army seargant who enters Rose's life just when she needs it most.

An awesome film that still holds up and desperately in need of a Blu-ray upgrade.

631137,5,6303354742,"When The Rose was originally released, in 1979, I was not even a glimmer in my mom's eye, but, knew well of the famous title song, growing up and into my early college years. The haunting melody and lyric are so beautiful and memorable, I even learned to play it on the piano and sing it for a music class. It nearly made me cry. While a young teenager, I had the great good fortune of being introduced to some of the most legendary music of the 1960s and 1970s. My mom had been a radio show producer, for some five years, and had a great record collection and wonderful ear for good songs. One of the singers I came to fall in love with was the late, great Janis Joplin, who became a part of the ill-fated ""27 Club."" Some of the best and brightest musicians were snuffed out, at age twenty seven years old, due to hard living (read: substance abuse, destructive life choices).

This film depicts the life of a Janis Joplin-esque rock star (Bette Midler), who goes by ""The Rose."" She is burnt out by her hard life on the road, filled with empty affairs, hard drugs and plenty of alcohol. She is exhausted, drained and self destructive. Though she begs for time off from the road - a year off to get some much needed rest - from her manager (Alan Bates) he does not allow it. There is too much money riding on her gigs. So, The Rose must force herself to sing, tour and takes different measures to maintain her fiery, sultry and charismatic stage persona (self medicating with booze, drugs and picking up groupies along the way - male and female).

Bette Midler has an amazing and ethereal quality, here. She is funny, haunted and absolutely unforgettable. She sings and struts her way through a string of hard, bluesy and sexy songs. You feel her character's emptiness, despair and instability. Her wicked manager uses her as his cash cow, even though it is clear that she is destroying herself over her level of fame and the pressures of the road that completely take her away from any sense of peace. The performances are sensitive, gritty and unabashedly believable. It saddens me that Bette Midler did not win an Academy Award for this wonderful performance of her career. What a brilliant performer - as actress and singer. Wow. This film will stay with me for some time. Unforgettable.",1340755200,,2291,4.518072289156627

631141,3,6303354742,"It is about 12:30 and I just finished watching The Rose. Though, I've always be fond of the song, I've never seen the movie before.

So,so sad. My eyes are watery and my stomach tight. My heart, broken.

What a lonely, cold tale about a rock star living on the edge. And, being a film from the 70's, they really take their time here to let Bette Midler feel and live through this character. A character who is raw, impulsive and self-destructive. At times, very much like a little girl lost. She is just outstanding here.

But what is so sad about this character is she is merely just a puppet. Her manager pulls the strings and refuses to listen to her pratically beg for some time off....'Just one year.' she promises.

Another character, an old female friend/lover, who comes late into the movie also pressures her for attention. Her new young guy friend, obliviously her first 'true love', or...(is it just desperation to feel wanted?)...also pushes her for a commitment. He wants her to run off to Mexico with him and leave everything behind.
And then there's her old buddy,from her home town, the drug dealer that dangles the stuff in front of her even after she says 'I'm clean now'.

I know this is just a simple review of things that happen in the movie and to the character. There is so much more going on under the surface that only a true movie lover would appreciate. Or, someone who is interested in 'what goes on behind the scenes' of falling celebrities. And then, of course, if your a Bette Midler fan, well, I'm sure you have already seen this or know about.

Remember, the movie does take it's time (which is usually the norm for character dramas back in the day) and the concert scenes go on for awhile, often giving the movie a docu-drama kinda feel.

For me, 'Beaches' will always be my favorite Bette Film. But I'm not going to compare them. They are two totally different styles. I like soap opera like drama, and  'Beaches' has that in spades.

I remember being introduced to Bette in the 80's when I was about sixteen. I remember seeing 'Ruthless People' 'Outrageous Fortune' and a few of her other comedies in the theaters and hearing people roar with laughter. About a few years later, I was in Washington, D.C. with my then boyfriend, and, on the way back to home, we passed a theater and decided to see a movie there at random.

Well, when I saw it was 'Beaches' on the marquee, I said 'hell, why not. Let's go see another Bette Midler comedy.' I had no idea that, even though it was a comedy, it was also a drama. I was still thinkin' she was making silly films like 'Big Business' with her and dorky Lily Tomlin.

Boy, was I wrong! The melodrama hit me like a tidal wave and the moment I saw the hearse, and heard Bette's 'Wing Beneath' song play, tears squirted out of my eyes like a little baby. Seriously. I cried the entire 45 minutes back to Baltimore, non-stop that night. Thank God I wasn't driving. And I hardly ever cry at contrived Hollywood films. My favorite genre is horror movies for crying out loud!

Anyway, that's when I really took notice of Bette Midler. Okay, sorry to digress. Back to The Rose!

Midler is really wonderful in it. She is the star, along with her manager. I only wish it had trimmed some of the concert footage and fleshed out some of the minor characters around her.

I would of liked to learn more about her connection with her parents, and definitely more about David Keith's character who plays a military boy she picks up in a bar. It seems like a huge chunk of story concerning him was left out. I also picked up on a small hint of 'hanky panky' three-way action between Bette, him and the other guy she falls for. There is eyeball play for a quick second between the guys, and later, Bette and Keith get trashed and 'have a moment'...but nothing really shines any light on that.

I guess that's not the point of the film. But I wish they didn't introduce characters, and then just toss them to the sidelines, especially when the players feel so, erotically-charged.  There IS a story going on, somewhere, between her and her two young handsome suitors, but, like I said, it's only hinted at.

I guess I just wanted more melodrama than is needed here. Or, I'm looking for a homo-erotic edge that just wasn't there. You tell me. Nevertheless, The Rose is a fine movie and Bette is incredible! Check it out. Thanx for caring enough to read...Kevin Brian",1331769600,,4425,4.483830845771144
631182,4,6303354742,"I saw this in 79 I guess when it hit the theatres on its first run.....I got the DVD on a whim and just finished watching it for the second time.  My thoughts:

Bette turns in a fantastic performance............I guess this was her first film and what a debut!

I saw Janis Joplin at concert once and Bette does a pretty good job of channeling her.................I may be biased, but Janis sang much better.

Alan Bates is just terrific as her manager.........this guy is good in everything I have seen him in.

The movie needed more Harry Dean Stanton..............what an actor!...in his short time on the screen as the country singer/songwriter Billy Ray he sure makes an impact.

The concert footage is amazing..................only a film like Last Waltz which is a real concert documentary surpasses The Rose.

The music is great!!!  Very nostalgic for me.

My only quibble is it loses some pace before the final concert............overall I recommend this film highly.",1331078400,2,976,4.9753086419753085
631183,5,6303354742,"The Rose is a classic.  It contains excellent storyline writing and drama along with an *incredible* soundtrack.  These songs are awesome.  I wouldn't expect anything less from the 70's, however.  A golden period for music of ALL varities.

The film is about Bette Midler playing the role of the main character that goes by the name Rose.  She's a character that's a very successful performer and singer, however, her life goes through plenty of ups and downs... mostly downs.

For one thing, she has a severe drinking problem.  She drinks alcohol like most of us drink water, and she's usually drunk when performing on stage.  She's also extremely belligerent and stuck in her ways so it's really hard to explain anything helpful to her.  She'll just ignore it.

Her manager is a control freak basically who's stuck in his own ways as well.  This means the manager and Bette Midler's character constantly get into preventable arguments.  Rose wants to take a lengthy break from all the touring and singing because she's burnt out and needs some time to recover, however her contract doesn't allow any time off whatsoever.  Sooner, rather than later, her life spirals out of control as a result.

She meets a nice man during a limousine ride (the chauffeur) and they quickly hit off a wonderful relationship.  If you think for a moment that this extremely courteous man has the potential to change Rose into a better, more civilized woman... think again!  She's too far gone, unfortunately.  This is what the movie revolves around- her story.

I appreciate how the movie writers took time to allow Rose's stage performance to complete a few really good songs.  Like I say above, the soundtrack is really surprisingly memorable.  What the writers succeeded in accomplishing the most, however, is allowing time to build the character of Rose so we're able to witness every single aspect of her emotions.  This is best expressed during the final 20 minutes which is nothing short of brilliant writing.

I won't spoil the ending so I'll just say this... I should have paid closer attention to a certain unexplainable scene in the very beginning.  Seeing as how the movie is over 2 hours, I completely forgot about it by the 2-hour mark, though.

The Rose is a surprise.  Sure, it's dated (what movie from the 70's isn't dated though?) but I really love everything about this movie.  The writing, the song selection, the acting, everything is really phenomenal.",1323388800,,2456,4.883777239709443

631284,5,6303354742,"It's hard to believe that I've missed this film until now!  When I picked it up, finally, in the library I thought it was the life of Janis Joplin.  Well, obviously it's based on her life but this is presented as a fictional character.  I was a big Joplin fan back in the day but I really can't imagine that she would have done a better job than Better Midler.

The story is pretty predictable.  We've seen the brilliant, talented, self-destructive, musicians' lives before, complete with romantic heartbreak, booze and drugs.  Nothing new here.  But Midler does is so well.  Her singing and acting are both superlative.  This is not a one-dimensional performance.  As firey and wild as she is at times, she's also amazingly delicate and fragile at others.

Frederick Forrest is wonderful, too, as the fellow who seems to have the best chance of saving her from herself.  He's a terrific actor and very cute.  Alan Bates is good, too, as the greedy manager with the 70's hairdo.

There are a lot of concert shots which are filled with energy and style but some of her best performances are the smaller ones, like in the drag club.  Midler, as the Rose, fills her performances with so much energy and joy that you have to love her and root for her.

The film is a perfect shanpshot of a moment in time---the rock scene of the 60's and 70's.  But it holds up today, unlike others of that genre, mostly because of the performance of the Divine Miss M.  She's a great singer, a terrific comedienne and a powerful dramatic actress---what a combination.  She is quite slender and beautiful here, too.  As tragic as the story is, it's also highly entertaining with lots of humour and certainly great costumes.",1277337600,,1702,4.61

Throwing all of herself into this role, Bette Midler must have been exhausted at the end of shooting. It was exhausting just watching her character unravel. I have an insight and I may be wrong, as I am no psychiatrist, but I feel strongly that Mary Rose suffered from borderline personality disorder; she showed all the symptoms: fear of abandonment, alcohol/drug abuse & addiction, impulsive rage, impulsive sexual liasions, self-loathing, striking out at the one who loved her most, to name a few. Even though she was a fictional character, albeit loosely based on Janis Joplin, she felt real to me. Her reckless self-destruction was painful to see and I must admit I wept for her. This is the film to see if you appreciate strong, gutsy performances by excellent actors.

The thing that makes this movie awesome is that the live music was performed live, in front of various live audiences. Hats off to members of Alice Cooper's backup band at the time for kicking butt as Rose's band! Stellar performances. Apparently, the directors told people to ""show up just like it was the 60s again"" and they did! Midler has some pretty salty and memorible lines in this film...she can be wonderfully crass, yet we feel for her, pity her, and route for her throughout the story. That's called good filmmaking folks, and great acting. I disagree with the reviewer who said the film drags....no way. We are treated to long takes on single cameras. Even the live shots are not all choppy like an MTV video, thank goodness! This move was ground-breaking for it's time (1979) due to certain adult themes and language, it was very powerful and hard hitting and remains so. I saw this in NYC at the Ziegfield on opening week.

However, Bette Midler is this film's saving grace, not only with her first rate concert performances (the soundtrack is even more essential than this film), but with the depth she gave to a typically one-dimensional stock character.

Joplin was called ""Pearl"" while Mary Rose was called ""Rose"" as well as many other aspects that they share that I am sure that you can figure out without me pointing them out pretty easily without even seeing the film ...

Personally I enjoyed the film Thoroughly, I thought that the screenplay was well done, the direction was pretty descent & even the visuals were pretty cool for the 1970's BUT it is Bette Midlers performance that really lifts the film into greatness.

Midler nails all the details in her performance. Not only does she act superbly but also sings like a 60's rock star with extraordinary ease. Her facial expressions and body movements are timed perfectly and just about everything that an actress should do, she does ... perfectly.

Bette Midler sings all the songs and her role here is terrific. The movie is from the late 70's, so don't expect fancy film effects. Just enjoy the performances by Midler and the aura of those old Rock 'N' Roll artists who gave everything for their audiences, maybe a little bit too much. Those were the times where there was no difference between show and life. Those were the times when an artist could just drop by any Night Club/Hole any city in the US and give their very best, just for the sake of Art. Enjoy this movie and if you can, buy the Soundtrack as well. The Rose, the song that closes the credits in the movie, is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever listened to.

Recommended to any Bette Midler fan, to sex-drugs-& R'N'R fans, and to all Rock fans from the 60's, 70's, and fans to Janis Joplin. Rated R for drug use, alcohol abuse and strong language. After all of these, there is an after-sex scene where The Rose is in bed but you see her ""purely"" covered so we can't see anything. Makes no sense, but those were the 70's.

631392,2,6303354742,"Described as, ""loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin,"" The Rose would be much more entertaining if the film makers had gotten the rights to Joplins songs.  Bette Midler does an incredible job of re-creating a life of turmoil through the eyes of a sixties rock diva. An exhausted, burned out alcoholic who begs her promoter/manager (played by Alan Bates,) to give her a year off to rest, ""The Rose,"" is on the path of destruction.  When she hooks up with an AWOL Vietnam War Veteran, you find yourself hoping he can calm her down enough to save her, but of course, you know that won't happen.

Much of the movie is actual concert footage of Midler singing her heart out, doing ""Janis Joplin like,"" tunes, but again, this movie misses something by not using the real stuff.  And, as well as Midler belts out the songs, she sounds like Bette Midler singing 60's rock anthems and bluesy ballads; she doesn't sound like Janis Joplin at all.  Of course, Bette Midler doesn't look anything like Joplin, either.  Midler is a red-headed Jewish girl and Joplin was a bushy haired brunette from Port Charles, LA.  So, there are no physical similarities whatsoever between the real Janis Joplin and ""The Rose.""

This movie showed how the world at that time abused alcohal,drugs,sex,and Rock N'Roll. It is about this tired overworked singer(entertainer)who is trying to have a life and a career. She returns to booze and drugs to comfort her. Till one day she falls in love with a handsome drifter to help comfort her. But even he can't help her out of her self-created hell. She finnaly get's so tired that she can't take it anymore and she dies while performing on stage. Her manager is who to blame,because she asked for time off and he said no. This was a way for Bette Midler to show her great vocal talents as well as her brilliant acting talents. This was a beautifully done,great movie. I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as i have.

631440,5,6303354742,"Actually, as a movie simply taken as that (a movie) the film isn't so great, but as a concert film, its one of the greatest of all times... tied together buy the tragic rise to fame/pressures of success in ""da biz"" story... as a showcase for the Divine Miss M's enormous talents and a great rock and roll films with incredible high energy its probably the best ever made.  The onstage scenes are among the best ever captured on film... Bette Middler, the band, and the entire production company were obviously in top form.  At the time and even now no one accept maybe Tina Turner) was anything like her...  Most of the shooting even puts to shame the ""live concerts"" you see on MTV today, even with the latest state of the art technology ! ! !

Loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin, the film doesn't really go much into her upbringing, origins and rise to stardom, but moreso shows her demise at the hands of her greedy manager who simply won't let her quit... She does her best to ""get away"" (acting out, escaping, wreaking havoc, falling in love, going on drinking binges) between the concernts, but can never quite escape... and always winds back on the stage, which is where she shines and perhaps the only place she was meant to be...  and with a band like that, why not ? I remember playing the soundtrack over and over again as a child.  Incidentally two other great ""concert films"" were made in this era, THE JAZZ SINGER (starring Neil Diamond as a rock and roll singer who marries a shikseh and decides to strut his stuff on Yom Kippur to the aghast of his alte kakker father) and the (deservedly) much forgotten WAY OF THE WORLD, featuring live concert footage of Earth Wind and Fire... The BLUES BROTHERS would follow a few years later...

This was an era when THE CONCERT was a major part of American life (pre VCR, DVD, digital audio and cable) and that going to concert was part of the American experience... this movie was more than aware of America's fascination with the whole scene from what was going on backstage and the ""glamour"" of what was happening behind the scenes... and it did it unforgettably well.  My only dissapointment is that this film doesn't yet have the true cult status it deserves.",1118275200,11,2226,4.519900497512438
631441,5,6303354742,"It's hard to imagine any one else but Bette Midler in this role.

What helps of course, is that Midler is so thoroughly an *honest* artist, one who brings so much truth to her performances: she has not a phony bone in her body. There is not a false note in Midler's portrayal of a neurotic, desperately needy, burned-out, over-stimulated rock star who's had too much of everything in the wrong dosages. Midler brings a buzzing, physical charge to the movie, one that carries itself over to the viewer: it can leave you exhausted long before the movie's end. Enacting the role of a rock singer, Midler is the real thing. It helps, of course, that her true calling is that of a concert singer, but she has all the vitality, hyperkinetic presence and true star quality of the greatest female performers: the audience's response to her in the concert scenes has total believability. It's entirely possible, too, to feel both revulsion and a deep pity for the character's horrifying unpredictability and destructive lifestyle. Midler is such a charismatic presence that when you see her downing all the pills and booze leading to her death, you can actually feel the force of her own personality (and unerring acting skills) transmitting through to the viewer, of the drug's increasing take over. In the end, as her Rose, in the midst of a song, teeters further into her drug-induced stupor, and topples over in death, Midler achieves a genuine horror and tragedy. How Midler manages to leave such a feeling of dread and queasiness is a testament to her genius; her voice, her body, and soul seem to be dying right in front of our very eyes - it no longer feels like a performance.  It's as if a real singer was somehow caught on film in the last stages of being self-snuffed out. Bette Midler by this performance alone confirms herself as an extraordinary artist.",1116720000,5,1859,4.734567901234568
631442,5,6303354742,"Simple maybe...but not stupid. Why did I say that? Because I am so tired of these reviews by people who can't seem to simply enjoy a movie. This movie was what established me as a fan of Bette Midler. I felt that her performance was genuine and heartfelt. You can feel the lonliness and lost feeling a rock performer might have when on the road. However, you also enjoy the passion she exudes when on-stage. These feelings are what pull at you. I also loved the brassy way she has of telling people to *#@^>-off!

From the first moment Bette was on screen it was powerful, dynamic!  She tore up the stage belting out those ballads, and ripping our hearts out with her pain and addiction.

I never really enjoyed musicals, but this was more.  I know its based on Janis Joplin, but it could have been any rock star.  The pain and suffering seen through Roses eyes was so believable that I thought it was almost Bette's life story.  The skillful direction of Mark Rydell, who manages to blend the electrifying concert footage to the crazy back stage antics to the real isolation of the main character is rare to see in films.  This film is a prize winning rose in any movie garden.",1099180800,5,821,4.245161290322581
631444,5,6303354742,"This film brings back memories, and I'm glad the DVD finally came out, though there are no extras. Bette, in her film debut, was brilliant and deserved every award she got. Often compared to Janis Joplin, I think the screenplay of Bill Kerby & Bo Goldman gave Midler a bit more personality and personal angst. Midler handled it all like a seasoned pro. A truly excellent performance. Her concert scenes were good, too. Frederic Forrest was nominated for an Oscar, and he was quite fine (he was also in ""Norma Rae"" with Sally Field, who won the Oscar over Midler in '79). But it was Alan Bates as the oily, manipulative agent (baby-sitter?) who truly deserved recognition. The Oscars also recognized the film for its Sound and brilliant Editing. Sorely missing from the nominations were the Adapted Score and the wonderful title Song, written by Amanda McBroom.  This is a powerful and entertaining film, with fine acting and great direction by Mark Rydell, loaded with humor, pathos and sadness, and all brought to life by the remarkable Bette Midler. It's worth watching again. Also, watch for David Keith (her personal bodyguard/masseur, later on), who later made such a strong impression in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"".",1073260800,15,1223,4.936893203883495
631485,3,6303354742,"First of all, this is a fantastic movie with a great searing performance by Bette Midler and electrifying musical numbers. However, I am disappointed with the lack of features. It didn't keep me from buying the DVD, as I did not own this movie previously. The only features are a theatrical trailer, some trailers for other movies and DVD issues, as well as a commentary by director Mark Rydell. A movie like this definitely deserves a Special Edition, single-disc or double-disc. However, I bought it in Best Buy for $9.99, so for $10, it's a good DVD, but in the future, I'd love to see a special edition.
Another pro to the DVD, besides a commentary and a low price, is the picture and sound quality. Much better than what I saw on television, although it could probably stand to be restored to even better quality. Maybe on the Special Edition DVD, if there ever is one, it will be fully restored.
All in all, if you don't own this movie, like I didn't before I bought this, then buy it, even though it's pretty bare bones. If you own the movie on VHS, I'd hold out for a Special Edition, unless you absolutely have to own it on DVD, then go for it!",1073001600,8,1153,4.392523364485982
631486,4,6303354742,"This biopic of Joplin can be enjoyed on its own merits as the age-old theme of the outsider rising to fame and then falling from grace. It doesn't really capture Janis Joplin's personality as revealed by the biographies and her own music. Also, for me it's impossible to picture Bette Midler as a rock singer.

631487,4,6303354742,"Those of us of a certain age well remember the ultra-talented and ultimately doomed 60s icon, Janis Joplin.
In this thinly disguised Joplin biography, Bette Midler outdoes herself as an out-of-control, incredibly talented, self-destructive singer who turns to the bottle, sex, and anything else she can to hide from her intense inner pain. It sounds like a cliche, and by now it is, but that was Janis--and Bette does her one better. Her angst shines through with great poignancy, even when she is belting out hit after hit, responding to her audience as though she is making love.
Hard living, hard boozing, and bent on destroying herself, the singer has us riveted to her story. Her tearful phone call to the father who never approved of her is one of the high points of the film: Bette pulls out the stops.
Alan Bates is divine as always as the singer's manager, but this film belongs to Bette. If you are not aware of Midler's incredibly wide-ranged talent, this is the perfect movie. It can make you a lifelong fan.",1025654400,90,1020,4.70391061452514

Bette Midler is absolutely fantastic (as always) and her songs are pure energy. I'd say an alternative title would have been 'Forces of Nature'. For me the best part ever is the last one, from when she's left alone in her home town and makes a stop at a bar she used to sing. After she's dragged out and takes all the pills she is so out of it and how can't you feel for her. She drives to the old school where she makes one of the most sad calls in history, to her parents, and if you have seen it before, you know it's the last time their parents will ever speak to her. Then she recollects what's left of her power and manges to call her manager, only to pull herself up to the stage and sing her last song. How can you not die when you see what happens next? And right after it, the title song, most depressing song ever, starts and plays on the end titles and on a moving bulb light. The 'Camellia' scored part where she's choppered in as well, a prelude to this sad end. One of the best movies for me, just for this part and for all of it. I hate the manager character.",959558400,12,1192,3.9502074688796682
