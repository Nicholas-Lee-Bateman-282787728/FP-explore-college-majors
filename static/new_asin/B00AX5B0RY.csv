5524893,5,B00AX5B0RY,I loved Stoney Burke since I was young and I don't care who brings it out as long as someone did and it doesn't matter if its closed-caption or not as long as you can watch it but some people do need it but not me I will take it any way I can get it and thankyou for bringing it out shout I will be so glad when mine arrives.,1366070400,2,325,3.591549295774648

5524895,5,B00AX5B0RY,"In 1962, 2 shows about rodeo cowboys hit the air.  There was ""Wide Country"" starring Earl Holliman and Andrew Prine, Thursdays 7:30 on NBC and this series starring Jack Lord, Monday nights at 9 on ABC.  They were both good series, both lasted one season and were gone.  The only difference was that Earl Holliman on ""Wide Country"" was a champion and Jack Lord on ""Stoney Burke"" was trying to become one.
A couple of years ago, Timeless video released the entire series of ""Wide Country.""  I watched each episode and it was an excellent show.  Also, for timeless video, the quality was good.  I hope they do the same fine job with ""Stoney Burke.""
One of the many good things about Stoney was the supporting cast which included Warren Oates, who became one of the movies great character actors (appearing as several filthy and repulsive characters in Sam Peckinpah westerns) and Bruce Dern, who became a major movie star, starring in, (among other things,) Hitchcock's last film ""Family Plot.""  Another of Stoney's buddies was Robert Dowdell, who enjoyed a four year run as Chip Morton on ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.""  The show was created and produced by Leslie Stevens, who continued on ABC Monday nights, after Stoney's cancellation, with the classic ""Outer Limits.""
As for Stoney himself after the cancellation, Jack Lord allegedly turned down the leads in ""Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" ""Twelve O'Clock High"" and ""Star Trek.""  (While Stoney was on, Lord appeared on movie screens as CIA agent Felix Leiter in a little movie called ""Dr. No"" starring a little-known actor named Sean Connery as a little known character (at least in the U.S.) named James Bond.)  Anyway, in 1968, Lord finally agreed to another series as a police detective named Steve McGarrett in a new cop series named ""Hawaii Five-O.""  And the rest is tv history.
""Stoney Burke"" was a good, solid drama series.  Like the other rodeo series ""Wide Country,"" I remember watching and enjoying it.  I look forward to its release on DVD.",1359590400,35,1999,4.826979472140763
5524896,4,B00AX5B0RY,"STONEY BURKE (1962-63; 32 one hour episodes; created by Leslie Stevens; a Daystar Production), Starring Jack Lord (""Hawaii 5-0""), Warren Oates, Bruce Dern (""Silent Running"") and Robert Dowdell (""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") comes to DVD at long last from Timeless Media!

Just a heads up that die-hard fans of THE OUTER LIMITS **might** be interested in purchasing STONEY BURKE on DVD, since many of the cast and crew from THE OUTER LIMTS had previously worked on STONEY BURKE.  Quoting from THE OUTER LIMITS COMPANION Book (1998) by David J. Schow (page 15): ""A quick look at STONEY BURKE's credit roll...reads like a dry run for the soon-to-come OUTER LIMITS dream team.  Every episode features at least one actor who would later appear in a pivotal role on THE OUTER LIMITS.  Many of the music cues composed by Dominic Frontiere to augment cowpunching action found their way into assorted OUTER LIMITS episodes as part of Daystar's permanent library of soundtracks.  Episodes of STONEY BURKE, weirdly enough, even LOOK like episodes of THE OUTER LIMITS--albeit an OUTER LIMITS in which the concerns are bronco-busting, rather than hobnobbing with creatures from outer space.""

5524910,5,B00AX5B0RY,"I have watched 3 of the DVDs discs--about 15 episodes.  It just gets better with each episode.
The lighting and shadows and photography are probably better than anything I have seen---truly amazing.

I was trying to figure out how to described the show---the one word I could come up with is  absorbing.  Completely absorbing.
The show is deep and stories interesting.
The characters play off each other so well.

Jack Lord's portrayal of Stoney Burke is completely different than his portrayal of Steve McGarrett on
Hawaii Five O.
Steve McGarrett was a little stiff and all business.
Stoney Burke is more 3 dimensional.
There is a toughness to him but also an honesty and softness---he is kind -----I love kind and gentle men.
He accepts people for who they are.
He sees behind the faade they put on.  He seems able to understand why people act the way they do---even if they beat the heck out of him or is a liar and cheater as is the Warren Oats character.

I liked Steve McGarrett but I love this Stoney Burke.
I love how the show comes on---I love how happy Stoney Buke looks as he comes in and puts his saddle down and spins that spur---he just loves doing what he doing.
This has become one of my all time favorite shows---I mean really---what is not to love about this show.

I read an article about the photography that went into this show  as well as the writing, directing and acting.
It is a great article and fun to read. It inserts some pictures to demonstrate what they are talking about and I would
recommend you read it before you watch the DVD's. Here is the title along with the link:

5524949,4,B00AX5B0RY,"Hey...what can I say?  It's a TV series that came out nearly 50 years ago!  (darn...how time flies)  I haven't viewed all the episodes yet, but so far the ones I've seen have been well written, scripted and acted. Bit of ""moral to the story"" or ""life lessons"" type endings sweeten the pot too. Jack Lord is pretty credible as a rodeo cowboy climbing to the top of the championship standings while trying to maintain his integrity.  Warren Oates is wacky/fun as usual (for a character actor).  Entertainment from a simpler, perhaps 'purer' more naive age.  If you were there ""in the sixties"", you probably don't remember this short lived series either. But if you DO remember it, you might recall how this series stood out (similar to the way ""Combat"" and ""Twelve O'Clock High"" did).  Fairly good quality.  Does it stand up today?  Technically, yes.  Culturally, no more than ""The Dukes of Hazard"" does...or ""I Dream of Jeanie"".  If you buy and watch this, you are watching nostalgia and/or recalling your youth.  But you are also watching a good quality show that ""tells a story"" each episode w/o today's distracting 'back ground theme music', social commentary or lurid/vapid dialogue, themes or ""un-reality TV crap.  So if you want entertainment from the start of TV's golden age that lasted into the 70s, this one's as good as any from that era.",1441152000,,1348,4.783549783549783

5524962,5,B00AX5B0RY,"The previous fine review by Don McGregor covers the excellence of this series in passionate detail, so there's no need for me to duplicate his efforts there. But I will mention a couple of other points that occur to me while watching these episodes in all their black-&-white glory.

First, the approach to violence. Not only is Stoney depicted as a man secure enough to avoid unnecessary fighting, he isn't an angry or violent man. Yes, he'll stand up if the situation requires it -- but more often than not, it's on behalf of someone else, not himself. He's capable of understanding what might drive a man to fight with him, without feeling the need to even the score. As he says more than once, ""In the end, they're all people.""

Even more importantly, this is one of the few times I've seen fighting depicted as having serious, even potentially fatal consequences. Nobody just gets up happily & shrugs off a punch; people are cut, bruised, and often in danger of concussions or worse. The first time we ever see Stoney throw a punch, we also see him rubbing his hand afterward & grimacing because it hurts. How many times have we seen people knocked out by a blow to the head, with not a second thought on anyone's part? Here, such a blow could well be deadly, and the characters know it. Violence is ugly here, not entertainment.

And beyond physical violence, there's also emotional violence, which drives & damages many of the people Stoney encounters on his quest for the Golden Buckle. ""They're all people"" -- and quite a few people are wrestling with demons they can't control, or even can't see when they look in the mirror. The series reflects the exceptionally literate writing of early 1960s drama, as seen on other shows such as ""Route 66"", ""Naked City"", ""The Defenders"" -- writing that draws on novels & the stage for its rich, sinewy style. No need for CGI or explosions or high tech here -- the human heart in turmoil offers all the drama you'll ever want.

Then there's Stoney himself. We don't get to see this sort of essentially decent man in TV & films too much these days, and that's a shame. He's not too improbably good -- he makes mistakes in judgment, he can be briefly tempted by the easy life at times -- but on the whole, he's doing his best to live an honest, meaningful life in a world that can too often be corrupt. And while he enjoys an evening with an attractive young woman, he's unusual (especially for that era) in his ability to simply be good friends with women, to enjoy their company & empathize with them as fellow human beings, not merely as potential sex objects.

Which brings us to another key point: the danger of power & money to distort & sometimes destroy human lives. This aspect of the series is frighteningly relevant, as Stoney encounters those who think everything in the world has a price tag -- and if people won't sell their souls to the wealthy & powerful, they're in danger of being crushed for daring to stand up for themselves. If it was true then, it's even more true today. This hollow, destructive urge for wealth & power is in opposition to Stoney's quest for a personally meaningful goal achieved without harming others, or betraying his own integrity.

The acting is both subtle & sharp, with Jack Lord turning in a multi-faceted performance, one that not only reveals plenty of personal strength, but a great capacity for empathy & compassion. The supporting cast & the guest stars are equally good, with special attention to Warren Oates as a trickster type who stands half in the shadows, but brings tremendous vitality & humor to every line he speaks.

Sadly, this superb series only lasted one season, and we never get to see if Stoney finally wins the Golden Buckle or not ... but that really doesn't matter. He's already proven himself a champion in a deeper sense, maintaining his dignity & self-respect while doing his best within the rules -- both the rules of society & the rules of life he's set for himself. I agree with all the previous reviewers who can't praise the series highly enough. It really is a lost treasure, and I'm grateful that it's been made available on DVD. Simply wonderful in every way & most urgently recommended!

Edit 1/17/15 - While the entire series is consistently well-written, well-acted, and well-directed, I want to call special attention to the two final episodes, ""The Test"" & ""The Journey"". In these stories, Stoney is pushed to the limit & beyond by both Fate & human evil, with Jack Lord giving performances of astounding subtlety & power. ""The Journey"" in particular is not only a mythic rite of passage, a descent to the very gates of Death & Damnation, but a poignant & heartfelt statement by creator Leslie Stevens on the network cancellation of this impressive series. The passion & integrity expressed here puts just about any contemporary TV show to shame. Not to be missed!",1416096000,,4899,4.662037037037037

While I was fairly young (7) when this show was on TV...it didn't ring a bell and I can only assume it was on late or competed with an alternate favorite.  Back in the day, VHS/DVD were just letters.  I've just finished first DVD and it was great.  Loved the story lines and various messages being sent.  Jack Lord, Warren Oats, Bruce Dern and Robert Dowdell blend well together within excellent acting.  Most exciting are the guest cast members...Ed Asner, Caroll O'Connor, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Duval (to name a few).  For fans of yesterdays early sixties fashion, cars, housing...you'll get all that and more!  Truly recommend.

Update: Just completed the entire set and I must say, well worth the watch. This program went beyond standard TV and contains high moral values that teaches as well as entertains.

The quality, sound and stories are great and when I was through watching all the episodes, I found myself wanting more.  It's too bad old Stoney Boney didn't last more than one season.  It is important to note here that Stoney Burke was my introduction to Warren Oates and Bruce Dern.

I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but I'm missing three episodes.  On three occasions on three separate discs, it would skip over an episode, so three discs actually only have four episodes on them.

The acting was first class by some of the highest trained actors to come out of New York and the West Coast. This is not just a modern Western like but Route 66 and Naked City and later I Spy this was an example of the great writting of the 60's that made each episode a human interest story and a time capsule of the times.

He's surrounded by loyal and not so loyal friends who move from one rodeo event to another. Many of the shows are centered around the people the cowboys encounter in the different locations where they appear.

Jack Lord is very close to his Steve McGarrett character of Hawaii Five O, but he's not a cop here! Half the character actors on this series are known actors today and it is their performances as well as some interesting storylines that make this show a good watch.

The writing is probably similar to much of what was being written for television at the time, but because of the unusual basic premise of the show it stands out. Shot in black in white the prints and dvds are of an excellent quality.",1384819200,4,878,4.585987261146497
5525052,5,B00AX5B0RY,"A Fantastic TV jewel,worth its weight in Gold! ""STONEY BURKE"" is the vintage series,because it was Leslie Stevens very 1st TV
series,for his Daystar Productions company,which he founded in 1959,as well as being among the finest of the United Artists TV
library,which flourished heavily in Primetime durring the 50s and 60s. being this was Jack Lord's first series before ""HAWAII FIVE-O""
in 1968,these episodes do not disappoint,as viewers are drawn into the intimate universe of a struggling Rodeo Rider,trying to pursue
The Golden Buckle,while also seeing the superb writting,and the talented directors,like Tom Gries,Robert Butler,and Laslo Benedek
among the few,who,with Leslie Stevens,directed most of the 32 episodes,durring the 1962-63 TV season. and seeing the episodic
promos in some of these shows,gave it more value,since these things were rarely seen,in the 50 years since this show debuted on
ABC-TV. but the main value with ""STONEY BURKE"",was seeing the credits of the many people at Daystar Prods-people like Robert
H Justman,who later became associate producer for ""STAR TREK"",and most of the technical crew,along with Dominic Frontiere's
music-among which,were familiar scores,that would be used in Daystar/United Artists' next groundbreaking TV series,""THE OUTER
LIMITS"". but the joy of watching a good drama-adventure series like ""SB"" is just a great appreciation,especially with the familiar
guest stars,many of whom,later worked with Jack Lord in ""FIVE-O""-the value is truly for those like myself,who are very familiar with
many of these people,both actors,and the crew,many of who,went on to achive greater accomplishments in other cinema work! but
of the totally rewarding episodes of this series,was its last episode,""The Journey"",which gave this superior TV drama the kind of
conclusion,rarely seen in shows today! Leslie Stevens,may he Rest in Peace,sure had lots of passion for ""STONEY BURKE"",
especially with the doomed Horses,that the charecter just couldn't let these wonderful animals die like that,showed that really superior level of drama in the last episode,,and it was powerful!! i highly recommend this vintage TV series to serious fans out there,
because before ""THE OUTER LIMITS"" made sci-fi TV history,""STONEY BURKE"" was a seriously great piece of TV viewing,with
charecters that viewers could really appreciate and enjoy! kudos to Timeless Media Group and MGM/UA for finally making this
rare TV gem availible on DVD-it is worth it!!",1382918400,5,2472,5.612299465240642

are interesting, and some quite unusual, leaving me guessing until the end.  And I also get a real kick out of Jack's performances--many of his mannerisms and inflections are what you see in Hawaii Five-0!  And funny:  contrary to his phenomenal powers of perception in H 5-0 (NO ONE gets the better of Steve), as Stoney he is sometimes rather naive, and prefers to give even the creeps the benefit of the doubt--until they prove themselves unworthy, of course.

5525091,5,B00AX5B0RY,"Before ""Hawaii Five 0"" there was ""Stoney Burke"" with Jack Lord in the title role. It's about a rodeo rider who longs to become the Champion of Champions by winning the Golden Buckle, the highest accolade a bronc-rider can receive. This is a well-made series created by Leslie Stevens who would also produce the classic Sci -Fi series  ""The Outer Limits"",""Gemini Man"",""Search"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"".The series falls between action and drama with a supporting cast that includes Bruce Dern,Warren Oates and Robert Dowdell [Chip Morton on ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"".Oates' character as Ves Painter, is  a childhood friend with flaws. Always ready to run away from trouble and leave his best friend in the lurch who he always referred to as ""Stoney Boney"". Just as Jack Lord coined the phrase ""Book em Danno!,murder one""in Five 0, had this series lasted longer, ""Let's Dance"" would have caught on as this is what he says whenever he comes out the shutes  on a buckin' bronco.
Plenty of footage of rodeo exhibitions are interwoven into each episodes story. Jack Lord gives a masterful performance of a rodeo rider portraying with conviction all the glory and danger that comes with a job such as this. As with everything he has done he gives a wholly convincing and believable and professional performance.
My favourite episodes are:
CHILD OF LUXURY: A woman spurned by Stoney vows to exact revenge by stopping him competing in the rodeo. But will she stop at murder? Guest Ina Balin
FIVE BY EIGHT BY EIGHT: A man holds Stoney hostage as he breaks out of prison after the rodeo performs there. Guest Ed Nelson
DEATH RIDES A PALE HORSE: A man [STEVE COCHRAN] stands beside two graves. One a woman's another a little child's. Why? What's his connection. Also why does he want Stoney dead. Guest Steve Cochran
KING OF THE HILL: Stoney's hero comes to town. But the man considers Stoney a threat as his time has passed. But can ageing stop him from trying to prove he is still the best. Guest John Dehner
WEB OF FEAR: Someone is out to get  Stoney, threatening his life with mysterious phone calls. Then accidents start to occur. Guest Caroll O Connor
FORGET NO MORE: A woman comes one night to the rodeo looking for her father. Why? As he was killed years before in front of her. Guest Laura Devon
THE WEAPONS MAN: An accident at the rodeo happens when an indian arrow hits one government official. But was it an accident or murder? Guest J.D.Cannon
THE TEST:Stoney is paralysed after he is caught in the shutes on a bronco. Guest James Coburn

You have to like rodeo and cowboys, but Jack Lord is comfortable in the skin of the cowboy, and makes you want to watch
him in that role. I looked for years before this release was available. Stoney Burke and Route 66 are two series well worth owning - if you like cowboys or Corvettes. What's not to like.",1376524800,3,549,4.083333333333333

I think some reviewers put a lot of high and mighty ideals into this show such as comparing Stoney  to a knight and his squires, etc.  I just plain like the characters, listening to how the cowboys talked, watching the rodeo scenes, enjoying the great photography, being transported by the wonderful music and learning about the struggles of being good and honest versus bad and sneaky.  Strong people with deep principles can't be bought off with money - ""You better believe it""  It had good lessons for when I was 10 years old and good lessons for today.

Individual episodes stand alone, but there was the underlying theme of Stoney's quest for The Gold Buckle (Saddle Bronc Champion) throughout the one-season run. As the series wound down, he did not get the buckle and it left you hanging for the next season, which never happened.

Part of the lack of recognition for this series (and probably the main reason for it) is that it is repeatedly mislabeled as a western. What a bunch of bull! It was a modern-day drama that happened to be set to the backdrop of the rodeo circuit. It was not a western.",1370563200,8,785,4.6

GENERAL DESCRIPTION NOTES
""Stoney Burke"" is a contemporary and realistic short-lived cowboy series (one season and thirty two 50 minutes episodes) based on the rough life of rodeo rider Casey Tibbs and whose leading character (played by pre-""Hawaii Five-O"" Jack Lord) walks in the path of David Miller's pessimistic feature film: ""Lonely Are The Brave"" (starring Kirk Douglas). The concept of the series is summarized like this: rodeo drifter Stoney Burke works for and with the Bristols by crossing rural America and each episode shows hostile third party (business men, millionaires, politicians, salesmen, the town hall, local committees, convicts, gamblers) trying hard to prevent him from organizing his job and riding at the rodeo and therefore he becomes embroiled in the personal drama of the people he meets.

...

This country-dweller-oriented drama is shot like a harsh Film Noir and deals with the daily miseries and moral issues of maverick Rodeo contestants! The social backdrop is a blend of many influences: from John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (starring Henry Fonda) to Nicholas Ray's ""The Lusty Men"" (starring Robert Mitchum) and the television traveling series ""Route 66"". Actor Jack Lord is credited twice--at the start of the opening titles and of the end titles--which indicates it's his show; for the anecdote, actor Warren Oates used to call him Coop because Lord worshipped actor Gary Cooper's acting style. Oddly enough, during the same season (1962-1963), Revue studios launches a rival show: ""The Wide Country"" (starring Earl Holliman and Andrew Prine).

...

The quality of ""Stoney Burke"" lies in the production values, thanks to series creator Leslie Stevens and head of Daystar productions who directs ten solid episodes and writes eleven scripts. Apart from the series producer, three directors distinguish themselves as inspired artists: Tom Gries (see ""Five By Eight by Eight"", ""Cousin Eunice"", ""Death Rides a Pale Horse"", ""The King of the Hill"", ""To Catch the Kaiser"", ""Kelly's Place""), Leonard Horn (see ""The Wanderer"", ""Point of Entry"", ""Kincaid"", ""The Test"") and Laslo Benedek (see ""Bandwagon"", ""Cat's Eyes"", ""Web of Fear"", ""Color Him Lucky"", ""A Girl Named Amy""). Most of the cast and crew come back the next season in the science-fiction anthology, ""The Outer Limits"". Above all, this is the first official assignment by academy winner cinematographer Conrad Hall which teams up with his working teacher Ted McCord (see Leslie Stevens' ""Private Property"" and ""Hero's Island"").

...

And we catch a glimpse of Stevens' wives: Kate Manx in ""The Contender"" and Allyson Ames in ""The King of the Hill"". Four episodes are intended pilots for spin-off series: ""The Mob Riders"" (alternate title: ""Tack Reynolds"" with young mechanic-test car driver Tack Reynolds), ""Point of Entry"" (alternate titles: ""Border Patrol"" and ""Border Town"" with Mexican police Lt. Luis Escalon and American police Lt. Joe Cardiff), ""The Weapons Man"" (alternate title: ""Mark Vickers, Master of Weapons"" with weapons scholar Mark Vickers) and ""Kincaid"" (with New York City youth worker Detective Sgt. Andy Kincaid).

BEST DRAMA NOTES (in broadcast order)
 ""The Contender"" (directed and written by Leslie Stevens and guest starring Kate Manx, Phil Abbott, Bartlett Robinson). Stoney Burke is falsely accused of letting kill saddle bronc champion Harland Bristol while riding Megaton and the family clan (the old Clay Bristol and his youngest son Cody Bristol: his sister Erlie and her fianc rodeo contestant Royce Hamilton, his friend and employee E.J. Stocker) turns against him but one day and after signing a contract with Everett Fields, Stoney gets injured on a horse and his friend and manager Ves Painter abandons him to his predicament and, instead, works with shady businessman Fields. Stoney asks the help of his former enemies: the Bristols.
 ""Child of Luxury"" (directed and written by Leslie Stevens and guest starring Ina Balin, Eduard Franz). A wealthy young woman named Sutton Meade is attracted by Stoney Burke at the rodeo but he declines any offers because of her spoiled kid manners and that's the beginning of his trouble. She complains to her influential father in order to punish Stoney and gives him a lesson.
 ""Point of Honor"" (directed and written by Leslie Stevens and guest starring Scott Marlowe, Patricia Breslin, Ian Wolfe, Harry Dean Stanton, Ben Johnson). A young and drunk man named Soames Hewitt from a Southern family of lawmen signs up to ride a bull in order to pay back his debt--an irregular check of $300 taken from his father's bank account--and stirs up Stoney Burke and his friends to hide his guilty conscience. Act 1 starts with a fantastic scene showing bull and bronc riders edited in slow motion. One scene is edited out (minus 2 minutes 32 seconds) in which Ves Painter makes a political digression at the pool bar.
 ""Sidewinder"" (directed and written by Leslie Stevens and guest starring Edward Binns, David White, Gail Kobe, Strother Martin). Stoney Burke busts a bronc which crashes through a safety fence and therefore a female spectator is severely injured. There goes a lawsuit but things are not what they appear to be and Stoney investigates to thwart a devious plot.
 ""The Scavenger"" (directed and written by Leslie Stevens and guest starring John Kellogg, Paul Comi, James Mason credited as Enoch Gates). At night, Ves Painter is arrested at a bar by the local police who accuses him of murder. Stoney Burke tries hard to help his friend and to obtain evidence of his innocence with the help of an old tramp carrying a wristwatch stolen from the victim.
 ""The Wanderer"" (directed by Leonard Horn and written by Milton Geiger and guest starring Albert Salmi, Jacqueline Scott, Milton Selzer). Stoney Burke meets an old acquaintance at the rodeo named Leora Dawson who is on her way to have a baby but her reckless husband is missing so Stoney becomes her surogate husband.

CHARACTER STUDY NOTES
 Stoney Burke (actor Jack Lord) is born in the imaginary small town of Mission Ridge, South Dakota and is depicted first as a maverick loner and then as the righteous leader who behaves like a Spartan driving his partners in a Ford pickup car, an idealist, a saint, a rationalist and a puritan, refusing alcohol and tabacco and favors coffee. His diehard honesty breeds trouble amongst the new and dubious people he meets. When Stoney comes out of a corral, he exclaims: ""Ok, let's dance!"" Stoney Burke has five personal entries: ""The Contender"", ""Bandwagon""--in which he mentions his father--, ""Web of Fear"", ""The Test""--in which he looses the control of his legs after a bronc accident--, ""The Journey"".
 Vesper Painter (actor Warren Oates), the friend of Stoney Burke from South Dakota, is depicted as lonesome driver of a vintage convertible car and as a corrupted rat who sells his friends to the local big brass: see ""The Contender"" and ""Flight Night"". He has a criminal record as we discover it in ""Sidewinder"". Anyway, he represents the light side of the series because the character is a natural-born petty con man who looks for easy bucks, laughs, sings and plays the guitar. Ves Painter has one episode around his persona in which he fails to be sentenced to death for homicide: ""The Scavenger"". In the prison episode ""Five by Eight by Eight"", all the convicts know Ves. In ""A Matter of Pourcentage"", Ves first behaves like a crooked man at the start of Act 1 because he used to syphon the fuel tank of Stoney's pickup car and tries to con his friends with a jerry can and then gets along well with city-dweller gambler Harry Marsh (actor Jack Weston). In ""Forget No More"", Ves tries to swindle a mechanic with rodeo tickets and an old credit card in order to pay his repair and also rigs the pinball machine of a motel with a long wire. In ""Kelly's Place"", Ves seduces a hostess at the club by posing as Stoney Burke and swindles singer Kelly Stewart with a $10 dollars bet at the rodeo. In ""Tigress by the Tail"", Ves faces his female counterpart named Donna Weston (actress Elizabeth Ashley) that he hates instantly. In ""Point of Honor"", actor Warren Oates plays against his real life friend Harry Dean Stanton from Kentucky.
 E.J. Stocker (actor Bruce Dern) has his episode (""Cousin Eunice"") in which we meet his relative Eunice Stocker (actress Cloris Leachman)-a country brat-that Stoney Burke tames and educates to be a woman and a glamorous trick-rider. After ""A Matter of Percentage"" (episode #17), E.J. Stocker vanishes from the series.

__________
CHARACTERS BACKGROUND NOTES
From the pilot, ""The Contender"", we learn all about the title character background and his friends: opportunist Vesper `Ves' Painter (wonderfully played by the colorful Sam Peckinpah's actor Warren Oates), Los Angeles-born Cody Bristol (pre-""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" Robert Dowdell), E.J. Stocker (Roger Corman's actor Bruce Dern) and El Paso-born and cigarillo-smoking Red alias Lorenzo Smith (stuntman Bill Hart); and we even see producer Leslie Stevens' wife, Kate Manx who plays the sister of Cody Bristol and Stoney Burke's love interest. It doesn't feature a prologue or a teaser. Actor George Mitchell plays the semi-regular part of Cal Bristol, the uncle of Cody whose profession is rodeo stock contractor and only pops up five times.

__________
CINEMATOGRAPHY NOTES
Director of photography Ted McCord shoots six episodes--the pilot ""The Contender"", ""Flight Night"", ""Child of Luxury"", ""Point of Honor"", ""A Matter of Pride"", ""Sidewinder""--unlike Conrad Hall who achieves the bulk with a total of 26 episodes, starting with ""The Mob Riders"" (episode #5) but his Film Noir artistry takes off from ""The Scavenger"" (episode #8)--as well as in ""Web of Fear"", ""Joby"" and ""The Test""--and helped by lighting technician Lloyd Garnell (see Daystar Productions' ""Hero's Island""). For the pilot, Ted McCord is helped by two technicians: camera operator Richard Betcheller (see Daystar Productions' ""Hero's Island"") and assistant cameraman Bert Eason.

__________
GRAPHIC DESIGN NOTES
The main titles is divided in two parts: first the leading man comes close to the camera to show the rowelled spurs of his boots and then we see a series of rodeo stock shots edited with freeze frames. The last episode entitled ""The Journey"" has a unique end titles in which we see Stoney Burke and his friends training a horse at dawn in the background of a prairie while the camera crane goes up! The typeface used for the main titles is a white and shadowed ""Franklin Gothic Heavy"" originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton. Daystar Productions use the same one for the next show: ""The Outer Limits"".

__________
FASHION NOTES
Apart from his complete black jeans outfit, Stoney Burke wears a white sheep wool coat in seven episodes: ""Web of Fear"", ""To Catch the Kaiser"", ""Joby"", ""The Weapons Man"", ""Kelly's Place"", ""Kincaid"", ""Tigress by the Tail"".

__________
SOUNDTRACK NOTES
Composer Dominic Frontiere is also credited as production executive, musical director, associate producer which means he is in control of his work. Three craftmen assist Dominic Frontiere: music supervisor John Elizalde that is also credited as associate producer in selected episodes, music coordinator Roger Farris and audio supervisor Clem Portman from episode #2 to #15. The scores to notice are: ""Child of Luxury"", ""Point of Honor"", ""The Wanderer"", ""Point of Entry"", ""To Catch the Kaiser"", ""The Weapons Man"", ""The Journey"". Some of Dominic Frontiere's cues are so good that they are recycled all along the 1960's series as ""stock music"": see the first season of ""The Outer Limits"" (episodes like ""The Sixth Finger"", ""O.B.I.T."", ""The Zanti Misfits"" and ""The Guests""), the first season of ""The Rat Patrol"", the fourth season of ""The Fugitive"". A recursive action cue used for Stoney Burke's fistfight scenes will be recycled in ""The Rat Patrol"". Furthermore, the music supervisor also tracks a romantic cue from Dominic Frontiere's ""Hero's Island"" many times. For the aficionados of ""The Outer Limits"", you'll hear a proto-version of both ""The Outer Limits Signature Loop"" and ""The Galaxy Being"" in ""Forget No More"" and a proto-version of ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"" (Cf. ""Assassination"" cue) in ""The Weapons Man"". In ""Kelly's Place"", actress Elizabeth Allen performs songs in a club called Kelly's Place. ""Kincaid"" features a crime jazz score to encapsulate the urban feel of New York City. For the anecdote, when Stoney and his team go to a people bar at night we can hear a typical laid-back tune made out of accordion--Frontiere's favorite instrument--, bass and drum.

__________
CAPTION NOTES
There are no foreign subtitles, no closed captions, no English SDH.

__________
PICTURE QUALITY NOTES
The Timeless/MGM set features 6 discs, each disc contains 5 black and white episodes except disc #5 and disc #6 that have six, each episode has five chapters and none of the prints are restored--especially the main titles--but they look decent and crisp.

__________
BONUS NOTES
Apart from the pilot and thirteen episodes (""Point of Honor"", ""Sidewinder"", ""The Wanderer"", ""Five by Eight by Eight"", ""Cat's Eyes"", ""Joby"", ""Color Him Lucky"", ""The Weapons Man"", ""Kelly's Place"", ""Kincaid"", ""A Girl Named Amy"", ""Tigress by the Trail"", ""The Test""), the rest features a next week's trailer before the end credits which is the added value of this DVD set.

__________
CONCLUSION NOTES
The DVD set alone deserves three stars because of its two lacks (subtitles, image restoration) and the edited episode (""Point of Honor"" lasts 47 minutes 28 seconds against the regular 50 minutes). On the other hand, the series itself earns five stars as the logo of Daystar Productions because it is a bitter sweet social drama filled with poetic realism. Here comes the final verdict: ""Stoney Burke The Complete Television Series"" gets four stars to support it.

Compared to today shows Stoney Burke was excellent show.",1369180800,4,179,4.294117647058823
5525131,5,B00AX5B0RY,"I just finished watching the 32nd and final episode of this recently released DVD set. I was curious about it from having been a fan of the Outer Limits and knowing that Leslie Stevens, Dominic Frontiere and Conrad Hall all worked on both series. I had never seen Stoney Burke before. I was too young when it was on ABC originally and it never made it to reruns in NYC.

This series far exceeded my hopes or expectations. The formula is tried and true. Stoney Burke (Jack Lord) can be viewed as a knight on a quest to win the Gold Buckle (National Rodeo Championship), with Cody (Bob Dowdell), Red (Bill Hart) and E.J. (Bruce Dern) as squires. Burke can at other times be viewed as an almost Christ-like character with the others as his disciples. Either way, he is a man who is pure at heart and dedicated to winning the Gold Buckle. He is NOT however a man who will do ANYTHING to win that Gold Buckle. He is highly principled and honest. His high principles and morality are contrasted against another of his followers, Ves Painter (Warren Oates), who is one of the least moral or principled characters ever to play a regular role in a series.

The series is much like other 1960s television, with the main characters traveling from town to town, meeting different people in each episode, and becoming embroiled in their dramatic life struggles. This gives the best character actors from the era lots of opportunities. The format enables the writers to examine every dramatic possibility. There is romance (of course) and corruption and greed and dilemmas of conflicting commitments and self-destruction and small-town prejudice and salvation. In one way, the earliest episodes are some the best.

Leslie Stevens wrote all the earliest and he understood the characters the best. He obviously LOVED the Ves Painter character, and the episodes Stevens wrote are those that Ves is his most vivid and vile. Warren Oates steals many of those shows, spouting some of the best and most colorful dialogue and providing both comic relief and intense frustration. Stevens also made sure that Stoney's followers/friends had a lot to do with the action. They get into many scrapes with- and on behalf of- Stoney. In the middle of the 32 episodes, when other writers took over, the followers move farther into the background and the series suffers a little for it. Still, that being said, I can't say there's a dog in the entire 32 episodes. Even the weakest shows are good, solid TV drama. I was hoping that the series would end strongly and I was not disappointed. Stevens wrote and directed the final episode, in which all the recurring cast members play an important part. Stoney takes a mythological journey during which his soul and faith are at stake and he is almost literally staring at the abyss. 'Nuff said. You'll have to watch it.

You can't talk about Stoney Burke without talking about the music and photography. Dominic Frontiere's music is very lush and romantic and is employed judiciously throughout the series. Just as he did the following year with the Outer Limits, he provides just the right flavor to the emotion of each situation. Outer Limits fans will be shocked at how much of that series' music was lifted directly from Stoney Burke. At times, it almost felt like I was watching an Outer Limits episode, but without the aliens.

Conrad Hall took over all the photography after the first 6 or 7 episodes, when Ted McCord fell ill. Hall was McCord's camera operator. I cannot possibly praise Hall's B&W photography as much as it deserves. Under the least visually interesting directors, such as Tom Gries, he is perfectly competent and quite good. Under the more daring or innovative directors his work is sublime. He does things with camera movement, lighting and angles that gives me chills. His work makes good scenes great and great scenes unforgettable. His work here is some of his best B&W work- and that's saying a lot.

The sound and visual quality of the DVDs are perfect.

I highly recommend the series to anyone who likes old B&W-era TV, and especially to fans of Jack Lord (you'll see some of Steve McGarret's stalwart integrity here), Warren Oates, Conrad Hall or 1963 Lincoln Continentals, Thunderbirds and pick-up trucks, for that matter.",1368921600,17,4271,4.810626702997276
5525132,5,B00AX5B0RY,"I am very glad to have this in dvd format.

Jack Lord was a dear friend of mine. The first time I saw him was as Stoney Burke.
Most people think of him as Steve McGarrett of Hawaii Five-0 but he's done a lot more in stage/film/television. His favorite role was as Stoney Burke. The series only ran for one season on ABC-TV.

The series is based on the life of rodeo champion Casey Tibbs (1929-1990).
Casey Tibbs was World All-Around Rodeo Champion in 1951 and 1955. He was Saddle Bronc Riding Champion in 1949, 1951 through 1954, and 1959. He was also World Bareback Bronc Riding Champion in 1951. He made the Life magazine cover that year. He was also mentioned in the movie 'Bus Stop' starring Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray.
{by the way: Jack Lord was a classmate of Marilyn Monroe at The Actor's Studio and he tested for 'Bus Stop'.} Mr. Tibbs was the consultant for Stoney Burke and guested on the show as himself and as a rodeo judge.

After the series, Jack Lord toured the country giving talks at schools and appearing at various other venues including Rodeos in the southwest. He sang songs,played guitar and did some rope tricks. Some people say he didn't play guitar. I have news, he did and he won an award for it too. It is my understanding that the attendance records at the rodeo venues still remain unmatched. In addition, Jack also received a 'Wrangler' award from the Cowboy Hall-Of-Fame for his realistic portrayal of Stoney Burke.

If you love Jack, you'll love Stoney Burke --",1367452800,12,1496,4.550185873605948
5525133,5,B00AX5B0RY,"The question many of you will have coming to this piece is: Who the hell is Stoney Burke, and is there any reason I should care who the hell he is.

Stoney Burke is a TV series created by Leslie Stevens and airing in 1962 and 1963. Stevens' company, Daystar, would produce The Outer Limits the next year.

Stevens wrote and directed the first eight episodes of Stoney Burke, a series about the rodeo circuit used as an arena for a number of anti-establishment themed stories, in a time when there were few television shows examining or questioning the status quo. At first it seems curious that this modern-day western be used as a motif for living a non-conformist life-style, but in a tilt of thought, it's appropriate, because despite the closed environment of the rodeo, the people who live it travel from place to place. The dream of winning a golden buckle is meaningless to most outside of the rodeo circuit. The dreams are big. The challenges are physically harsh.

Stoney Burke has just been released on DVD by the Timeless Media Group. In terms of classic TV I think it is one of the most important additions to DVD this year, along with Maverick - Season 2 from Warner Brothers and the upcoming Have Gun, Will Travel - Season 6 by CBS DVD. This is not because all three have a western motif, but because they are all unique series, with charismatic stars and tightly written scripts and a tone that is all their own.

I want to thank Daniel and Ruth Blair for gathering stills for me, to give you an idea of the look and ambiance of Stoney Burke. These photos are NOT taken from the DVD set, and some may not be as sharp in look as they are on the DVDs. But they will give you a visual idea of how subtle, how unique Conrad Hall's cinematography for this series was. A tip of the Stetson to both Dan and Ruth.

The Casey Gibbs rodeo company provided an authentic backdrop to the bronc riding and bulldogging events.

Why should you care about Stoney Burke?

Here's a list of reasons.

Stoney has been an almost ""lost"" show, unlike the others I mentioned. I have been in the New York area for over thirty years and I have never seen the series syndicated. I had read about the show, knew of its existence and that some cinema historians held it in high regard. Now, with this release on DVD, Timeless has included every episode, uncut.

Many of the episodes even include the half-break bumpers and at the end, the trailers for next week's episode. You might want to be careful in watching those previews in this age of spoilers because sometimes they sure show a lot of what happens, but still, something many companies fail to realize is that the collectors and the ones who loved these shows want them as close to the way they aired as possible.

And Timeless has delivered on that front.

I still can't figure out why Warners, which is doing a beautiful job with its Warner Archives in restoring films and TV series, doesn't include the bumper breaks and their trailers with shows like Maverick. Nobody went into commercial breaks better than Warner Brothers in the 1950s. Jack Warner may not have wanted to spend much on the TV series, but William T. Orr made them seem special, the way Walt Disney made whatever you were watching seem one of a kind. On series like 77 Sunset Strip, the theme song would come up, the title of that week's episode would flash over the logo, the announcer would intone with solemnity that 77 would be back. The opening fanfare with a downshot on the Warner Studios as the announcer intoned, ""From the entertainment capital of the world, produced for television by Warner Brothers!"" made me want to go there more than Disneyland. Yet, Warners continually cuts down on many of these features that made them so unique.

Stoney has it all included, even if by this time television is using less fanfare to orchestrate what they are bringing into your homes.

So, the first thing you'll be missing about Stoney Burke, if you never see the show or buy this set, is that this is Leslie Stevens writing fervently and with passion, bringing together talent that would go onto long histories in television and movies. But this show, these stories, would be hard to find.

There's much more, and many stills from the episodes, up on my Comics Bulletin piece,
for those who want to read and see more Stoney.

If you haven't seen the show, it should give you an idea how strikingly beautiful Conrad Hall's
cinematography is.

Check it out.

And hope you enjoy it and the DVDs.
