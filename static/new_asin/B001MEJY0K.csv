8321115,3,B001MEJY0K,"First off, this movie is in B+W and not color, as Amazon indicates in the product details. Bummer, as I figured it would be awash in late 60's psych colors, if little else. Secondly, I should have realized that having seven directors helming a flick that clocks in at 73 minutes was sure-fire cinematic suicide. Thirdly, there is no dialogue spoken by any actors in the film, it`s all voiced-over in English though it`s a French flick. It begins with a visual montage of late 60`s iconography for a few moments before one of it`s directors delivers the first of many tales that begin and end nowhere before the next director takes the wheel on another joy-ride to a dead end. Each vignette gets more nudity involved, so I guess we're building towards a climax I must've missed. There is a generous amount of nudity, but as an Arthouse film, it`s a total bust because no pertinent statements are made, and there`s nothing artsy involved. It has more in common with the nudie-cutie 60's sexploitation flix distributed by Something Weird Video than anything else. And it has as much to do with Giovanni Boccaccio`s 'The Decameron' as a Missionary has to do with the Missionary Position... no real stories, no real art, no real sex, no real satisfaction for me.",1272672000,6,1257,4.718181818181818
