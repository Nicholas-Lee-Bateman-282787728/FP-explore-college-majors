5126079,5,B0083TUEDS,Thank you Paramount for deciding to release season 6. I do believe that everybody and myself are unpatient when it comes to the release times but at least paramount is stepping up more than Warner bros releasing their products.,1338163200,24,227,4.846153846153846
5126080,5,B0083TUEDS,"Glad to see season 6 is on the way for Gunsmoke. CBS has given us A-1 great quality in this series. Will buy more Gunsmoke as quick as you release them, keep them coming!",1337817600,29,170,4.029411764705882
5126081,5,B0083TUEDS,"Season six was the best season of Gunsmoke, as the writing and characterizations had improved with each successive half hour season; the compression of stories into 26 minutes each guaranteed brilliance. CBS has digitally remastered all the half hour episodes, which hopefully they will continue doing for the hour seasons 7-20. CBS, please pick up the pace on Gunsmoke DVD releases, as none of us are getting any younger!",1337644800,52,422,5.130434782608695

5126117,5,B0083TUEDS,very good,1474502400,,9,4.0
5126118,5,B0083TUEDS,Story writing or scripts begin to get better and you can tell why this show eventually went to a one-hour series. I always thought that the early seasons of Gunsmoke would leave almost each episode hanging because of the half hour time restraints of each episode.  This DVD is still high quality even in Black and White.,1473033600,,320,4.614035087719298
5126119,5,B0083TUEDS,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,3,883,4.966216216216216

5126124,3,B0083TUEDS,"I was a high school kid during the first 5 seasons of Gunsmoke and often didn't have time to watch the show.  I had forgotten the early years were half-hour and I must say I now prefer the short version.  I am struggling to decide which character is more annoying, Chester or Festus.  I note with interest that Ken Curtis(Festus) appeared in several early episodes as various characters.  Very enjoyable.",1460678400,,404,4.728571428571429

5126242,5,B0083TUEDS,In my opinion Gunsmoke is one of the all-time classic western shows. The shows are well written so the whole family can enjoy them. Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference.

Always amazed at the array of outstanding ""unknown"" character actors this series used.  You would see an actor and think what a terrific performer and read the credits and the name was no one you could remember.  Perhaps the secret behind the success.  Instead of being bogged down with big-name guest stars, the producers showed wisdom in choosing the perfect actors for the roles, however small.  Great stuff!",1369180800,,533,4.943820224719101

I have very fond memories of watching Gunsmoke when I was growing up and I enjoy it just as much today. Of all the westerns that were so prevalent on TV in the 50's and 60's there are only a very few that have stood the test of time and are every bit as entertaining today as when they were first broadcast. Gunsmoke is at the very top of that list! The actors played their parts so well and played off of each other to add humor to each episode, which often was also a lesson on life!",1357430400,,569,4.0

5126328,5,B0083TUEDS,"I watched Gunsmoke when I was growing up and loved every episode of the program. I didn't get to see all of the episodes because I joined the Air Force and was stationed in Japan for 3 years, so I missed a lot of the programs. It wasn't always Matt Dillon that the episode featured. Sometimes, it was kitty who was the main character in that episode, another episode was mainly about Doc. Adams or Chester Good, and later, Festus Haggan. Most TV programs, the main character (in Gunsmoke, that was Matt Dillon) was always the hero in the program. Not all episodes was a shoot-out at OK corral, but some of them were almost a comedy show. I enjoy every disc that i purchesed from you. I just received notice today that Seson 7, Volume 2 has been shipped to me and I will enjoy every episode on the discs. Keep more volumes coming!",1350345600,,829,4.354838709677419

5126352,3,B0083TUEDS,"I order the season's of Gunsmoke for my Grandpa all the time and he loves them, but they take forever to come out.  The only problem with this is that the people that most likely want Gunsmoke on DVD are an aging population and with the 20 seasons that need to come out it will take way to long if you are an older person.  I also feel that the season's should just be released as a full season and not volumes because then then maybe 2 seasons could come out a year, not just one.",1345420800,3,481,4.0

The hourlong shows started to concentrate more on other characters while adding more fill and fluff to fill in that extra 30 minutes.  To me the stories just weren't as good.

The episodes provide great insight to what life was about back then, and sometimes how strange ""manhood"" was viewed and the consequences that wrought.  Couldn't agree more with another reviewer...with 20 seasons to produce, they do need to be stepped up in release so us older generation fans have a chance to see them all.

5126359,5,B0083TUEDS,"Of all the releases of old shows the consistency of quality prints remain with Gunsmoke. The only problem is the expensiveness of the dvd. Should be priced in mid thirties for a full season is a feeling most of us fans agree is fair since the show ran for twenty years. As a matter of further agreement the releases should be excelerated since most of us baby boomers who watched the show back then won't be around for the availabilty of the last season. If memory serves this is the last season of the concise story telling represented by the 30 minute episodes. The show went to an hour in length in the 1962 season and Big Jim was rewarded with his own production company to partner with the CBS network as a means of greater financial incentive to do an hour. People in their reviews have remarked about the great character development of the stars, which began in season one and made the show the success it became instantly. When the show became an hour the beer timeouts in the Long Branch, a source of great comic relief with Doc and Chester, and later outright hilarity with Doc and Festus, became more numerous and longer duration. Guest stars got more air time, extra secondary characters were introduced..and grabbed more air time...and besides slowing the pace of the show with outright filler, the ultimate consequence was less of MATT DILLON!What the Duke was to movie westerns was what Jim Arness was to television westerns....yet the show lasted another 13 seasons until 1975. The last six or seven thanks to Mrs. Paley who loved the show and was the wife of the chairman of CBS network. They moved it to Monday nights and it rose again phoenix-like to the top 20 list....the rest is tv legend and "" get out of Dodge "" became part of the English language and lore.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodspiller-Book-One-Warriors-of-Palahia-Series/dp/B007055JQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series</a>",1340323200,15,1995,5.066869300911854

8524686,5,B0083TUEDS,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This episode, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive years.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1529366400,,803,5.083333333333333
