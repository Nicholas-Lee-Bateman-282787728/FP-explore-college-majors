8052486,3,B0007VY4O0,"If you set your DVD player on auto repeat, and don't mind constant full male nudity on your TV screen, this could be used as a screen saver. It is almost appropriately named, it is an aquarium with young men instead of fish. And I guess ""Boyfish"" does sound better than ""YoungMenFish"".
The set of Atlantis consists of a couple of columns and three broken statues. Most of the time the camera is stationary showing the six young men (around the age of 20) swimming in the nude back and forth through the set. A few times the camera zooms in for a closer shot as one of the young men swims past then returns to the original setting. Also a few times one or more of the young men will interact briefly with a prop on the set or with one of the other young men before swimming off set.
The quality of the video is fair, might be considered good taking into account that it is all shot underwater. The audio is only soft music.",1386201600,,922,4.214689265536723
8052487,1,B0007VY4O0,"The film presents several nude men swimming through a set meant to resemble ruins of Atlantis.  The lighting is murky in the extreme, making it difficult to enjoy the one thing ""Boyfish"" has to offer, the beautiful bodies of the swimming men.  Nothing happens onscreen beyond the swimmers crossing the screen from time to time.  It is animated wallpaper for your television.  Erotic?  I don't think so.",1156464000,5,402,4.940298507462686
