3787714,5,B001T21QPQ,"This is a very happy/sad spanish soap opera. I watched it all the way through until it was over and I wished that it would never end. I'm not a fan of how long the american soap operas last, but this one would be worth watching for the rest of my life. It has some of the most famous actors in the novela industry and it takes place in the presant time. I really don't like the novelas that take place in the past. All in all, you've gotta see this one!!!!",1238371200,4,456,3.967391304347826

3787736,3,B001T21QPQ,"I adore this telenovela and like everyone else I was hugely disappointed that they cut the main scenes with Milly and Alejandro out.
Ahem! Attention Televisa, the ONLY reason people purchase these dvd is to have a memorable couple tucked away in our sacred dvd collections. And while this is a wonderful story...once again the main couple is key.
Hopefully this helps with the next telenovela compilation they make.",1482364800,3,415,5.028985507246377

3787738,4,B001T21QPQ,"i don't know why the reviews are not higher. i have seen a lot of these dvd soaps, and this is one of the better ones.

cesar evora got a good role here. he gets to show a strong range of emotions. i love laura flores. she plays one of those characters that starts out mean and eventually becomes good.

basically, the rich son falls for a girl raised in an orphanage who goes to work in his house as a maid. his mother tries to keep him away from the girl, because his father once fell in love with a maid, who was forced to leave after she became pregnant. his father (cesor evora) hates his wife, because he was pressured to marry her and send the maid away.",1469232000,,661,4.076923076923077

3787742,2,B001T21QPQ,"What the heck? I don't know who the showrunner was, but they deserve to be fired from network television for the horrible job done in post. All the good stuff was edited out! There wasn't any of the relationship development between Rocky and Valeria. And what about the Lina/Bobby hookup? Oh, let's not forget about Socorro's daughter becoming a stripper, and her relationship with Hugo. The DVD series is the equivalent to a bone being tossed to a dog.

Milagros works as a maid for the wealthy Belmonte family. She and the family's youngest son, Alejandro, share a secret love. However, his wheelchair-bound rival Hugowho may or may not actually be crippledis also in love with Milagros.

One day, our lovers discover a secret that will change their lives forever: Siblings can't get married, and... guess what!

Yup, lots of secret pregnancies, wildly jealous lovers, outrageous plot devices, ""who's your daddy?"" and entertainment from the get-go. I'm not very fussy and I find telenovelas highly diverting. I got mine from Amazon.",1407542400,,653,5.1415094339622645
3787754,3,B001T21QPQ,"This ""movie"" is really good but the discs that came with it missed lots of details of the story.

3787755,1,B001T21QPQ,"Dont waste your time or money on buying this dvd. I am a big fan of telenovelas and i have to say this is the worste that you can receive. There are many points to cover but the min problem is the run time. If i had known better to read the box instead of just seeing one of my favorite novelas and adding it to the cart i would have caught that this set of dvds are incomplete. This novela is currently being aired and if you compare it to the dvd, you will be dissapointed. So much is taken out of the dvd that it becomes unwatchable. Its like a bad high school video project, so much skipping that if this was your first time watching it you will be comfused. Much of its humor is cut out, especially my favorite scenes!
Dont buy this, you have been warned.",1404950400,9,760,4.039735099337748

3787757,1,B001T21QPQ,I purchase the DVD because I saw the soap opera a few years ago and I really enjoyed it. But was very disappointed with the DVD unfortunately the way they formatted lost a lot of the key point of the original story. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE,1378944000,,250,4.122448979591836
3787758,3,B001T21QPQ,"The series itself was just ok. I don't normally complain about the editing because I understand the concept. These series can get long and its great that the effort is being made to condense the story and make it available to a wider audience. Still, the editing is very important. I felt like they missed the mark here. There was a lot missing from the story that could have made the edited version a bit more engaging. As is, the story just lacked something and fell shy of pulling me in because I could tell that I was missing out on some key moments.",1372377600,,554,4.336538461538462

3787761,1,B001T21QPQ,Bought this because I fell in love with the story. I had watched this with my grandma growing up. The DVD skips a lot of scenes. Which helps make the story what t is but because it has scenes messing it leaves you confused,1368057600,,222,4.068181818181818

3787766,1,B001T21QPQ,i was very disappointed with this product. it does not state that this is an edited version of the tele-novela. it's only about 14 hours long so they rush it a lot to get to the point. you miss out on a lot of moments that aren't worth missing.,1361404800,,244,4.0
3787767,3,B001T21QPQ,"I love this novela. The packaging and everything is good, but they cut out so many scenes! If you have a favorite scene from this novela then chances are they aren't in the DVD! All of Milagros musical numbers are cut out! There's not one scene where she's singing or performing! All the musical numbers are gone. I think this product is good but it was disappointing to see so many things missing.",1353801600,,398,4.465753424657534

If youl`ve seen ADCLG then this is a good buy. If not you will be lost! better off scanning the spanish channel late night/early moring they are bound to run it again,1352505600,,305,4.186440677966102

3787772,3,B001T21QPQ,I bought this DVD set for my little sister who feel in love with this novela. When we got it she poped it right it in. But right of the bat we realized that a lot of scenes were missing. I've watched this novela in full so I could tell that some important scenes had been cut. So viewing it is kinda hard because you go from one scenes to a completly different one with no clue what happend in the last one and no clue why your now in the middle of a completly diferrent conversation. Why cut those scenes out? To make it shorter? I have no clue why they messed with it. I rather pay more for one extra disc then for it to be choppy! But this novel all in all is great! Full of laughs and good times with a great plot! Just wished they would have kept it the same.,1335571200,,764,3.9038461538461537
3787773,4,B001T21QPQ,"Me Gusto Mucho la Historia Original de esta Novela, Mueca Brava que aos atras fue Protagonisada por Natalia Oreiro y Facundo Arana y aunque no he visto mucho de este Remake me dare la oportunidad de Comprar el Dvd para ver que tal esta.
Me Gusta Mucho Allisson Lozz y Eugenio Siller, hacen una Bonita Pareja y actuan muy bien, creo que tienen mucha quimica. Por otra parte me tienta muchisimo la Idea de ver a Ariadne Diaz como Antagonista, a Tania Vazquez y a Michelle Vieth, creo que son Buenas Actrizes y por los Avances que estube mirando me gusto mucho y fue que me decidi a Comprarla.
Espero no me desepcione, parece estar Muy Buena la Telenovela.
Cuando tenga el Dvd y lo vea les cuento que tal me ha ido con la Experiencia...
9/8/2011: Exelente Telenovela, Muy Bien Adaptada, Me Atrapo y esta Muy Bien Resumida, Contiene Las Mejores Escenas, Lo Mas Importante. Muy Recomendable el Dvd!!!",1311984000,,895,4.6

3787779,3,B001T21QPQ,"I teach an upper-level Spanish class in a high school and the students really wanted to see an authentic telenovela in installments during the school year.  I read reviews of a lot of storylines and checked out the scene selections of various popular titles.  This novela seemed to be relatively ""PG"" and so I gave it a go!

I would have liked Spanish subtitles to go along with the Spanish audio but only English subtitles are available.  The zippy Mexican Spanish can be a little hard to capture so subtitles are important to me.  When the English comes up on screen I feel like I'm ""cheating"".

The main character, ""Mili"", is a little abrasive for my taste.  I'm trying not to let her obnoxious personality get in the way of my enjoying the story.  I have to say that the high-schoolers don't seem to mind her as much as I do.  They like seeing her get way up in the face of ol' Alejandro.

Lots of people really loved this novela and at least it's contemporary.  The final chapter aired in June of 2008 so it's only about a year old.  That helps the clothes, cars, etc. look like they belong in this millenium.  I think a 1980's novela wouldn't hold my class's attention.  (That being said...check out Cinco Amigas.  A little dated but kids get into the story.  Available on Amazon!)",1254700800,5,1287,4.482758620689655
