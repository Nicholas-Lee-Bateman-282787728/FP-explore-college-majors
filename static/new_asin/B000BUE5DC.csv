2441919,5,B000BUE5DC,"Magnum P.I. is my favorite TV show of all time. Season 3 is my 2nd favorite season. (Season 2 is my favorite.)

Here are the episodes from season 3:

Did You See the Sunrise? - This 2 hour episode is my favorite episode of this season. This is a complex tale about the Vietnam War, a POW camp, physical and psychological torture, brainwashing, and assassination. This episode helped to define the intensity and seriousness of the series. Magnum has some very traumatic flashbacks to the Vietnam War. This is the episode that introduces the Maggie Poole character. This is also the episode where Higgins constructs his model of the Bridge On The River Kwai. We find out that Magnum's favorite movie is Stalag 17. This episode is classic Magnum all the way through.

Ki's Don't Lie - This is the first part of a crossover with the TV series Simon and Simon. Morgan Fairchild also appears. An old Hawaiian statue brings trouble to anyone who possesses it. The complete story, including the Simon and Simon episode, appeared as bonus material on the season 1 DVD set.

The Eighth Part of the Village - Magnum goes to the loading dock to pick up a package for Higgins. The package contains a surprise.

Past Tense - T.C. is forced at gunpoint to fly into a prison and help one of the prisoners escape.

Black on White - This wonderful episode creates some humorous odd couple type moments as Magnum and Higgins are quarantined together in the guest house because they may have been exposed to ""African Hemorrhagic Fever."" Meanwhile, Higgins is being targeted for assassination by an African Mau Mau who is sneaking around the estate. We hear some fascinating stories about Higgins's military experiences in Kenya. Hearing that handheld Pac-Man game always cracks me up. Bibi Kiamini is such a babe!

Flashback - Magnum wakes up in the year 1936. Other than that, everything else is the exact same as it always is. This fantasy episode is highly enjoyable.

Foiled Again - Higgins enters a fencing competition. During the competition, Higgins kills his opponent. Oops!

Mr. White Death - Ernest Borgnine appears as a professional wrestler.

Mixed Doubles - Magnum is the bodyguard/babysitter for a spoiled brat teenager who also happens to be a professional tennis champion. Her character is so deliberately awful that the episode is kind of fun, in a cheesy sort of way. Just don't take this one too seriously, and I think you'll enjoy it.

Almost Home - Magnum has to clear the name of a World War II soldier who was wrongly court martialed.

Heal Thyself - Magnum has to help an old military friend who has been falsely accused of murder.

Of Sound Mind - Roscoe Lee Browne appears as Magnum's butler. Yes, Magnum has a butler, because he just inherited $50 million dollars. This crazily fun episode is a wonderfully humorous satire. The masquerade party is quite interesting.

The Arrow That Is Not Aimed - Magnum befriends a Samurai warrior, who is trying to protect a valuable ancient porcelain plate from 6 ninjas. This is a wonderful tale of friendship, action, adventure, and humor. I love the way that Magnum finds out which plate is the real one. This is a great episode.

Basket Case - Magnum acts as social worker for a teenager who lives with foster parents. (Yeah, yeah. I know. Not every episode is a winner.)

Birdman of Budapest - In this relatively bad episode, a guest on the estate is driving Higgins crazy. (And no, I'm not talking about Magnum.)

I Do? - In order to solve a case, Magnum pretends to be married.

Forty Years From Sand Island - Magnum tries to find out what really happened at a World War II Japanese internment camp.

Legacy From A Friend - Magnum has to solve a murder case.

Two Birds Of a Feather - This horrible episode was to be the pilot for a new spinoff series. Fortunately, the new series was never made.

By Its Cover - Magnum helps protect an old friend from a corrupt police officer.

The Big Blow - This is a cheesy satire of Key Largo. With a hurricane in progress, several guests are trapped at the estate. All the usual cliches are there, including a woman who is 9 months pregnant.

Faith and Begorrah - This masterpiece of an episode continues a running joke that was started in ""The Elmo Ziller Story"" from season 2: around the time of World War I, Higgins's father served in the British military. As a result, Higgins has many illegitimate half brothers and illegitimate half sisters scattered all over the world. Naturally, this causes much embarrassment for Higgins. This time, the half brother is an Irish priest. Note how Zeus and Apollo react when Higgins tells Magnum, ""He's... illegitimate."" The desk clerk at the hotel is played by Donald P. Bellisario, the guy who created the Magnum P.I. series.",1130112000,152,4759,4.700361010830325

You'll have to take that up with Mr. Bellisario, I'm just the lowly flunky crashing in the guest house on this ocean front estate for my third season.  But, once again I'm running circles around Higgy Baby with the (usually reluctant) help of my pals TC and Rick.  As usual, all of my clients are lying to me about their true situation and I have to investigate them before I can solve the case.

Yes, it's all been done before.  But with my crew it's served up with lot's of laughter and a wink for the audience.  See, I just raised my eyebrows...again.",1427155200,,692,4.4015748031496065

2442007,5,B000BUE5DC,"Season 3 is my second fave, alongside 1 which has the Sharon Stone episodes, but never being a S&S series fan I found that one to be a bit unneeded- so I usually skip it when watching season 1. Season 3 is great! I did encounter some freezing/skipping on used but spotless DVDs but blowing on them and clearing them seemed to help stop the odd skipping. I can't believe Magnum cast members are now into their 80s age wise! I was watching Magnum at age 15 and was hooked back then....Long live Magnum PI!!",1406332800,,504,4.315789473684211

2442042,5,B000BUE5DC,"Seriously, this is a trip back to the 80's where life in tv was simple... You know who's good and who's bad...

2442043,5,B000BUE5DC,"I had a little trouble with the first season 3 that Amazon sent to me. All the disks were full of scratches and the picture was faded on the tv screen. The magnetic theft prevention sticker was stuck to the last disk, which after removing it caused one of the programs to skip. That is not for this that I am giving a five star rating. The five star rating is for Amazon's response to my request to return season 3 and to send a replacement. The process of making the exchange was seamless and Amazon sent the replacement season three overnight, so that I had the replacement seasnon 3 in my hands the next day. The new season 3 is in beautiful condition.",1398729600,2,655,4.290322580645161

2442058,5,B000BUE5DC,"If you can't digest the modern shoot 'em up horribly violent TV/Cable shows , take a trip back to the '80s  style of good guys.  Fun, stress free entertainment with Tom Selleck in the most gorgeous place on the planet.  Da Da Da Da.",1385078400,,232,4.2272727272727275
2442059,5,B000BUE5DC,"Beyond Rockford files, I find Magnum PI quite enjoyable.  Always situational, always good watching.  Since he isn't on TV anymore, having the DVD is rewarding",1383782400,,158,5.28
2442060,5,B000BUE5DC,"My husband and I LOVE ALL things Magnum,P.I.!  We're a military family and lost this season during a recent move and had to repurchase it!  Can't say enough wonderful things about Tom Selleck and Magnum, P.I.!  This was THE BEST season!",1375747200,,236,4.7073170731707314
2442061,5,B000BUE5DC,"Great service. Didn't take long time to reach here, and I live in Norway. I yet have to buy a codefree mobile DVD to see it(bought it for the English subtitles) but checked on my DVD at home. Great quality of the DVD. the wrap was all New. Tom Selleck will never disappoint me as an actor - so I am glad to have this DVD right by me now. The DVD is extraordinary because the American Version is better than the European. a better looking wrap. Johanathan Higgins Rick and T.C here are their best(from episodes i saw on t.v of this season long ago) - more sophisticated than before, and acted With more experience as part of the plots in the episodes. It's great serie because it's not all serious it's fun too and Higgins the ever stubborn guy made some surprises too. There are few series as popular as Magnum but without Hawaii, without Higgins Rick and T.C - that is - if Magnum would operate alone - it would be a dull serie. So all the characters contribute to each other. Again - T.C Rick and Johanathan grew up here With Magnum. it's the mid- season, the most important one.",1375488000,2,1081,4.303921568627451
2442062,5,B000BUE5DC,I recommend the third season of Magnum especially if this appeals to you. The DVD's/packaging were in very good condition. The price was very reasonable and that's the main reason I purchased it.,1375228800,,195,4.9393939393939394
2442063,5,B000BUE5DC,"Folks they do not make series like this anymore. I believe TV has gone way down hill since the end of the 1980's early 1990's. So sad, however you can buy these and make up for some of it. Awesome series with clean suspense, drama and a back story as well. Thomas Magnum was my hero in the 1980's and early 1990's. I did over 24 years in the Military with his training...lol Anyways I recently did a trip to Hawaii and I visited the Robin Masters estate. And yes it does exist. I actually swam in the tidal pool as well.",1374537600,2,520,4.107843137254902

2442089,5,B000BUE5DC,I really do like Tom Selleck's excellent portrayal of this character.  And only the good parts of Hawaii are presented.  Such beauty wrapped around such handsomeness and a good story line to boot.,1371945600,,196,4.909090909090909
2442090,3,B000BUE5DC,Ok,1364947200,,2,2.0
2442091,5,B000BUE5DC,"Season Three of Magnum, PI includes some great episodes (Did You See the Sunrise, Parts 1 and 2) and one of the worst (Two Birds of a Feather), but over all, it's got lots of the elements fans love: engaging and diverse stories, interesting mysteries and great interplay between the characters.  It's a must-have for any Magnum Fan's library and a good choice if you just want some 80's flashback fun.  The nice thing about Magnum is that the stories hold up very well, with time, unlike a lot of shows from the same era.

As for the DVDs, themselves, there have been no problems.  They are double-sided and we struggled with a few technical difficulties with the first season's double-sided discs, because of poor quality (had to return the discs for exchange).  However, season three has been just fine!",1361750400,,805,4.7214285714285715

2442093,5,B000BUE5DC,"Great show, another classic season of Magnum. The episodes though got NO special treatment for this DVD release. MONO sound, no picture remastering. They used probably the best available prints and it just barely makes the grade. Had they been any older they would have deff needed to be remastered and cleaned up. There are alot of specs and dirt marks on these prints, not enough to make you throw the set away but you can fro sure tell these are the original untouched prints. Maybe a tad or coloring would have helped, some of the episodes have a slight faded/washed out look to them, but again, enough to get buy with. Compared these to the remastered Hawaii Five-O or even Charlies Angles, which are a few years older and you see the huge difference in what remastering prints can do, those shows I mentioned look pristine quality, amazing colors and depth.  Anyhow....enjoy the show!",1359936000,,890,4.741935483870968

2442109,5,B000BUE5DC,I love this show and at $10.46 per season on DVD you can't go wrong.  I've bought seasons 1-3 already.  They arrived on time and in great condition.

2442113,4,B000BUE5DC,"""Magnum"" was one of the better programs of the '80s, and in spite of the occasional trite plotline or cliche, it's still worth watching. Unlike Jim Rockford of ""The Rockford Files"", Magnum can actually defend himself and doesn't constantly allow  himself to be made a fool of.  John Hillerman's character, Higgins, keeps things from getting too silly or melodramatic, and adds a note of dignity to the cast.",1315180800,,407,4.970588235294118
2442114,4,B000BUE5DC,"I see that the ""new"" DVD sets from the 3rd party vendors like Movie Mars have gone up in price. I bought Seasons 1-3 from these 3rd parties, and I paid something like $20 + S&H. Now, the 3rd parties have prices more in line with Amazon. I am assuming Amazon laid down the hammer and told them they couldn't undercut Amazon that much and still sell their products on this site.

I have not had severe problems with discs skipping and/or freezing. There have been a couple minor instances in the first 3 seasons. Once a disc skipped or froze, and I just removed it, dusted it off, and it worked fine. In another case, I couldn't fix it, and I just forwarded past that minute or two. Hey, it's a 30 year-old TV show that I've already seen. I'm not going to get in a twist and scream at the TV like Higgins. ""OH MY GOD!""

One thing I would note about Season 3: I bought it from a 3rd party vendor named aokmovies2. Well, the inside of the cases for each of the 3 discs has this black discoloration, which looks like it was burned. The exterior of each cases has a clear plastic coating which looks to have been subjected to some heat. The discs themselves worked fine. I don't recall any problems, except as noted above.

As for the TV series itself, I was a fan in the 80's. Now watching the show 30 years on it does seem to be a bit hit or miss in the first 3 seasons. Some of the episodes are just poorly written and/or edited. It's like they just wrote scripts on a cocktail napkin, and sometimes they lost the napkin. I swear, sometimes an episode just wraps up lickety split, and I'm thinking, Whoa! I feel kind of cheated. TV has gotten more sophisticated, and I don't know if this level of quality would have survived in 2011.

Having said that, Selleck and Hillerman are great. There is the car, the helicopter, and the Islands. And there are enough good episodes in these first 3 season to ensure I buy season 4, albeit at a higher price. As I recall, the series did get better, in terms of the quality of the writing and story ideas. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all ends.......again.",1313884800,2,2099,4.279596977329975

I purchased the first 2 seasons and had to send both back for replacements due to the terrible quality of the discs. I did manage to get a good set of each of the first two seasons by mating two copies of each. Even then, I've had one disc of season 1 professionally cleaned since. A HUGE hassle, but worth it to be able to enjoy Tom Selleck-y goodness whenever I want.

I ordered the third season with some trepidation, knowing the previous issues, but am relieved to say that both sides of all of my discs are in perfect condition this time! Absolutely NO errors in play, hooray! Perhaps the production company has noticed all the problems and is starting to put these out in slightly better quality.

I also gained GREAT respect for him for his handling of the Rosie O. attack he endured! I also find his cowboy movies are especially terrific examples of his acting ability, great story telling there. Never payed much attention to Magnum PI in the 80's when on TV, but now with TODAY's TV which is...well... total garbage, this show is a breath of fresh air. So I thought I'd buy the first season of Magnum, as I recalled it was a pretty good show, plus it has Selleck. What a great decision. The whole cast and the way they interact is like a tight family, funny, strong and loyal ties that bind, and is great fun to watch. You may find that a few episodes (here & there in season 4, 5, 6) are pretty simple (poorly written), BUT the actors tried to work with it and it's still the Magnum PI family.

2442140,3,B000BUE5DC,"This 1982-83 Season of MAGNUM, PI wasn't as good as the 1st Season, 2nd Season, 6th Season, 7th Season, or 8th Season, because the Third Season of MAGNUM wasn't quite as funny as the first 2 seasons, plus I had noticed that on the Closed Captioning mode of each 3rd Season episode of this MAGNUM, P.I. DVD had left out a lot of the words in the subtitles that were actually said and they had revised and/or edited the way the words were actually said on each episode, unlike it was on the DVD box sets of Season 1, 2, 6, and 7.

Therefore, MAGNUM's 3rd Season kind of lacked some of the more sophisticated traits that all of those other seasons of this detective drama had throughout MAGNUMs whole 8-year run on CBS. So creator(Donald Bellasario)should've done better on MAGNUM's 1982-1983 Season especially more like he did with the first 2 seasons along with the fact that MAGNUM's honeymoon phase of this show was fading while the detective drama MATT HOUSTON's honeymoon phase of the show was just starting when MATT HOUSTON made its debut on ABC in the Fall of 1982 on Sunday September 26th, 1982 which coincidentally happened to premiere on the same night KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC.

On the other hand, it was nice being able to watch all these 1982-1983 Season episodes complete & uncut with the appropriate introduction just like they were originally shown on CBS on their original air-dates as opposed to watching them edited & revised like they were on COZI-TV, WGN, USA, and A&E with too many deleted scenes to allot more time for commercials.

Additionally; I also loved the crossover episode ""KI'Is Don't Lie"" when Magnum(Tom Selleck) ends up teaming up with the short-tempered gonzo private-eye Rick Simon(Gerald McRaney)and the often festidious Andrew Jackson Simon(Jameson Parker)from the detective drama SIMON & SIMON to solve a bizarre rash of mysterious deaths plaguing the islands of Hawaii along with the fact that the detective drama SIMON & SIMON was kind of a spin-off of MAGNUM, PI.

This was also the season when Lance LeGault known for his role as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col. Decker),joins the cast as Magnum's disgruntled Navy nemesis(Col. Green)in the ""Did You See The Sunrise"" episode.

I also liked the episodes ""The Arrow That Is Not Aimed"", ""Birdman Of Budapest"", and ""Forty Years From Sand Island"", since they bring up things from Magnum and Higgins(John Hillerman)past and bring in some unusual intriguing things to those episodes like trying to retrieve a stolen priceless Japanese Picaso plate in the ""The Arrow That Is Not Aimed"" episode along with the fact that I got a kick out of Magnum and Higgins being called ""Magnum-San"" and ""Higgins-San"" by Magnum's client(Mako).

Additionally, the Third Season seemed to talk about Magnum's days in Vietnam the most more than any other season of MAGNUM, P.I. throughout Magnum's whole 1980-88 run on CBS for some reason.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1982-83 Season like
*Stuart Margolin in the ""By Its Cover"" episode after his co-starring days as Rockford's sleazy ex-con buddy(Angel Martin)on THE ROCKFORD FILES

*John McCook in ""The Big Blow"" episode before his co-starring days as Eric Forrester on BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Joanna Kerns in the ""Two Birds Of A Feather"" episode before her co-starring days as Maggie Seaver on GROWING PAINS

*Peter Brown in the ""Heal Thyself"" episode before his days on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL and YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Bill Lucking in the ""Two Birds Of A Feather"" episode during his co-starring days as the overzealous nemesis(Col. Lynch)on THE A-TEAM

*James Whitmore, Jr. before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's doofus fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwilliger)

*Nick Hammond in the ""Foiled Again"" episode after his co-starring days on the short-lived SPIDERMAN

*Ernest Borgnine in the ""Mr. White Death"" episode before his co-starring days as Hawke's faithful co-pilot buddy(Dominic Santini)on AIRWOLF

*Keye Luke in the ""Forty Years From Sand Island"" episode after his co-starring days on KUNG FU

*Richard Roundtree in the ""Two Birds Of A Feather"" episode after his co-starring days on SHAFT

*Barry Van-Dyke in ""The Big Blow"" episode before his co-starring days as Stringfellow Hawke's long lost MIA kid brother(St. Hawke)on the new AIRWOLF series

*Nick Coster on the ""I Do?"" episode after his co-starring days on SHERIFF LOBO and his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA, ALL MY CHILDREN, and ONE LIFE TO LIVE

I also liked the way Universal provided the posting of each of these episodes original air-dates along with a brief summary like Universal did with MAGNUM's first 2 seasons, KNIGHT RIDER's first 3 seasons, and THE A-TEAM's first 3 seasons.

For instance, the original air-dates to each of this seasons episodes on CBS were
9/30/82-DID YOU SEE THE SUNRISE?
10/7/82-KI'S DON'T LIE
10/14/82-THE 8TH PART OF THE VILLAGE
10/21/82-PAST TENSE

12/9/82-ALMOST HOME
12/16/82-HEAL THYSELF
1/6/83-OF SOUND MIND
1/27/83-THE ARROW THAT IS NOT AIMED
2/3/83-BASKET CASE
2/10/83-BIRDMAN OF BUDAPEST

This 1982-1983 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency.

So now that Universal has released all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to finally get MATT HOUSTON released on DVD soon, since I've been dying for MATT HOUSTON to be released on DVD for nearly 4 years now along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON was in competition with MAGNUM throughout MATT HOUSTON's whole 3-year run on ABC, since MATT HOUSTON was kind of a carbon copy of MAGNUM, P.I. not to mention that the stellar Matlock Houston(Lee Horsley)had a slight resemblence to Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck), except Houston was a lot huskier, a tougher, a lot more organized, and a lot more fortunate than Magnum ever was since Houston was a very wealthy man living high on the hog in a ritzy penthouse in Hollywood who had a detective agency in Downtown LA and was never broke, unlike Magnum who was always indebted to people since Houston was a filthy-rich playboy from Texas who moved to the L.A. Area to take over a family business overseas and did detective work on his leisure time as a hobby, unlike Magnum who lived on a shoe-string budget & rent-free at the so-called Robin Masters estate in Hawaii always struggling to make a living on a private eye's salary barely able to make ends meet, but Houston was always rolling in bucks and always had foxy babes around him, even more often than Magnum ever did.

Therefore, you could say that MATT HOUSTON was like a rich-mans MAGNUM along with the fact that many people used to tease Lee Horsley by asking him if he was trying to copy Tom Selleck, but would always tell them he wasn't, but that he was flattered they saw a resemblence, but would never take it personally because MATT HOUSTON was a very popular TV show just like MAGNUM, P.I. was, except MATT HOUSTON was obviously a more upgraded detective drama than MAGNUM ever was, despite the fact that MATT HOUSTON tanked after it's 3rd Season since it took a nose-dive in the ratings when MIAMI VICE premiered on NBC in the Fall of 1984 and was shown at the same time slot as MATT HOUSTON was which resulted in ABC cancelling MATT HOUSTON in the Summer of 1985 when MAGNUM's 6th Season was underway on CBS.

Fortunately I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON out on DVD on March 9th, 2010 and SIMON & SIMON is scheduled to be released on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both available for pre-order as we speak which shall give us 2 new classic private detective show releases to look forward to in the Spring of 2010.

In the meantime, I hope Universal re-releases this 1982-1983 Season of MAGNUM on DVD on single-sided discs like MAGNUM's last 3 Seasons are since the double-sided discs on this DVD box set keep freezing & skipping, especially in the ""I Do?"" episode of this DVD box set along with the freezing & skipping I have also gotten on KNIGHT RIDER-Season 1, 2, and 4; THE A-TEAM-Seasons 2 and 4; and MIAMI VICE-Seasons 1, 2, and 3; which is why Universal doesn't make them on 2-sided discs anymore.",1200960000,2,8564,4.893719806763285

Not only do I not know how I did it, it had turned itself off again the next day when I ran the DVD again. It is, in my opinion, a very poor system.

2442159,3,B000BUE5DC,"Is it just my imagination or is there something really, really wrong with Magnum?  There has to be.  Here we see him getting in all these exotic adventures and, nearly always, landing a top-quality girl in the end.

Not just that, but the girls in question are invariably bright, seductive, and willing.  Make no mistake:  over the years, Thomas Magnum has bagged dozens and dozens of high-class babes!  Rarely do we see him strike out.

And yet, something is awry.

Come the next episode, the newly-won girl is nowhere to be seen.  Magnum is once again free as a bird, with no prospects on the horizon.  What's happening?

I can imagine if one or two of these women turned out to be total flakes:  addicted to drugs, interested only in a one-night stand, besaddled with serious emotional problems, etc.  But all of them?

I have a theory.  Magnum, you see, despite his manly physique and swoon-inducing moustache, is possessed of private parts that are laughably diminutive.  Or categorically non-functional.

This is the only thing that could explain how Magnum can never seem to hang on to a single girl, regardless of how taken with him the woman seemed at the end of the last episode.

I can see them now, storming indignantly out of the guest house, chuckling cruelly as they light a cigarette and hail a cab, refusing to waste another moment with our protesting hero, who stands wrapped in a bedsheet at the door, tears welling in his eyes.",1178409600,3,1447,4.697211155378486

2442162,4,B000BUE5DC,"Magnum has aged much better than other Donald P. Bellisario shows and other action dramas of the 1980's (like A-Team, Simon and Simon, Battlestar Galactica, etc.).  Perhaps it's the ""exotic"" locale (and the fact that Hawaii today looks very much like Hawaii of the '80's).  Perhaps it's the performances.  I think it's really because of the timelessness of the episodes - Magnum is so firmly grounded in its own history that it is a complete universe and each episode further strengthens the series as a whole.  With this season, the full regular supporting cast is filled out with the first appearance of Carol, the District Attorney (although she is not played by the regular actress who, confusingly, does appear in another episode as a guest star).

It takes a while to build up a fictitious universe, which is why seasons 1 and 2 of the series are curiously normal - I don't think anyone watching the average episode from those seasons would understand the huge cult following the series has.  But, little-by-little, each episode added to the mythos, and it all pays off starting in Season 3.  There are many good episodes (and, to be sure, some dreadful stinkers - noteably ""Two Birds of a Feather"" and ""Basket Case""), but all of them are rooted in the histories of the characters, the history of the Hawaiian Islands, or both.  Certainly, a big hurdle was overcome by the producers of the show when they refused to succumb to the obvious gimmicks of the show - the Vietnam vet angle, the Ferrari, the locale - instead incorporating the ""gimmicks"" into the fabric each and every episode.  All the good shows of the series (and of this season) could only be told by this show.  They include:

Vietnam vet stories: ""Heal Thyself"" - a nurse Magnum knew in 'Nam is accused of murdering patients, and herself suffers from post-combat stress disorder; and ""Did You See the Sun Rise?"" - Magnum confronts a sadistic Soviet-Vietcong liaison officer he met while a PoW in North Vietnam.

Hawaiian Island stories: ""Forty Years from Sand Island"" - a murder at an internment camp for Japanese-Americans in 1942 has modern-day repercussions; and ""Almost Home"" - a grieving daughter tries to scatter her father's ashes at the Arizona Memorial, only to discover her father was courtmartialled for being AWOL on the day of Pearl Harbor.

Other history of the characters stories: ""Black on White"" - while Higgins is recovering from his wounds, his unit commits a massacre in a Nigerian uprising in the '50's, and a survivor is trying to exact revenge; and ""Faith and Begorrah"" featuring the first appearance of Higgins's illegitimate half-brother, Father Paddy, the drunken Irish priest.

The other hallmark of the Magnum series is the combination of heart and comedy - even the most dramatic episodes have moments of comedy, and there are a number of purely comedic episodes that contain a surprising amount of heart.  Cases in point: ""Flashback,"" where Magnum literally dreams up the solution to a case he's working on by transporting himself (in his dream) to 1936.  Similarly, master ham-meisters Ernest Borgnine and Donnelly Rhodes (best known to Canadians from DaVinci's Inquest, Danger Bay, and Soap) guest star in ""Mr. White Death"" and ""...of Sound Mind"" respectively, two shows that can only be described a comedies.

Overall, most of the episodes are good, and those that aren't still have something about them that helps build the overall ambiance of the series.  It's certainly the best season so far.",1160092800,19,3501,4.93526405451448
2442163,4,B000BUE5DC,"I have written reviews of the Magnum seriew on DVD and what I have said before still holds true of this season three release.

The only real difference is that whoever is making the transfer to DVD is in some cases stopping the transfer before the credits of each episode are completed. Now, this fact does not particularly bother me. My main concerns are the quality of the transfer, etc. However, if you are someone that is just very into getting every bit of an episode, including the credits, this collection might cause you some frustration.

I don't recall this issue with the seasons 1 or 2 releases, but have definately noted it regularly with this release.

Season three is a great time. While later seasons take more introspective looks at the main players, this one is still working along the tried and true plot lines that made everyone watch in the first place.

2442169,5,B000BUE5DC,"Season 3 was the breakout year for this series, with Tom Selleck and company at the start of their peak of comic/action/adventure with occasional serious undertones.  Some of the most memorable Magnum episodes, including ""Did you see the Sunrise?"" are in Season 3.  Unfortunately, aside from the 22 episodes themselves there are few extras, such as commentaries or short features, to attract fans or collectors. I realize it is unrealistic to imagine Tom Selleck volunteering to record detailed commentaries of episodes shot 25 years ago, but there must be contemporary promotional material and features shot for shows like Entertainment Tonight that could be added to each season set, or perhaps a cast commentary on a groundbreaking episode like ""Sunrise"". The single bonus is a Season 4 episode, which is redundant if you intend to buy Season 4.  Other reviewers have noted poor disc quality, and I did have one show where the playback ""hung up"" in the middle of a scene, even though a visual inspection of the never-played-before disk showed no blemishes or scratches. In all, this is still a good buy for loyal fans who want to enjoy uncut episodes without commercials, but will leave most of us hoping that Universal does a better job on releases of later seasons.",1143072000,5,1270,4.981132075471698

I guess it comes from the cool attitude, the decontraction and the obvious pleasure the actors had filming the show. They are also charismatic, Tom Selleck first. From my point of view, the whole 8 seasons were equal on a scenario and play level. It's always with a great enthusiasm that I re-watch the episodes and sometimes I even feel a little nostalgic. I know this review is quite short but to conclude, I definitely want to go to Hawaii!",1141689600,,605,4.3628318584070795

I had previously bought the first two seasons and had no problems with the DVDs. However, I've had nonstop problems with the discs from Season 3. Many episodes skip terribly, or stop in the middle and bring you back to the menu screen. One episode won't play at all! I'm extremely frustrated trying to watch these DVDs, and I feel ripped off. For all the money these sets cost, you'd expect them to be top quality! It's too bad for such a great show.",1140825600,37,583,4.407407407407407
2442176,1,B000BUE5DC,"What has happened to quality control at Universal?  These DVD's are terrible.

What a shame to put a truly great show like Magnum PI out on crummy DVD's!  I have season one and two on DVD, and they are great.  Season Three was a terrible shock.  Several episodes skip, freeze, loose audio or just lock up.

I have no problems playing any other DVD's, but these new Magnum DVD's are really defective.  The color transfer is also weak, and the images are noticeably grainier than season one and two.  Why?

The first two seasons came with four hours of bonus episodes; season three came with only one.

Also the subtitles are terrible now.  The subtitles no longer include French translations and the English subtitles are so abbreviated that they no longer accurately convey the spoken words.  Compare subtitles from season three to the subtitles on season one.  Two things are obvious:  Season One = Top Quality.  Season Three =  Total Cheapness!!!

I think that Universal knows there are millions of Magnum fans and it looks like they have cut their manufacturing costs and are shipping defective products knowing that the Magnum fans will buy these DVD's anyway.  That is a shame.

If you love Magnum get Season 3 but expect playback problems on a third of the episodes.",1140220800,17,1272,4.752293577981652
2442177,5,B000BUE5DC,"SPOILERS!

Never mind the rest of the episodes in this DVD set, it's worth the money just for the season opener, the two part ""Did You See the Sunrise?"" For my money, it was the best TV episode EVER.

We learn that during the Vietnam War, Magnum, TC, and a guy named Nuzo had escaped from a North Vietnam POW camp where they had suffered under the sadistic KGB Colonel ""Ivan.""

Nuzo then returns to 1982 Hawaii to tell TC that Ivan is back after them--the only three to ever escape from him. Meanwhile, Colonel Buck Greene of Naval Intelligence knows that the Soviets are up to something--and that it involves Magnum.

The real payoff of this two parter comes at the end. The Soviet plot is thwarted, with Magnum, Rick, Colonel Greene, Lt. Maggie Poole, and Admiral Hawkes all working together in the end. But the State Department decide not to offend the Soviets and let Ivan go.

As Magnum tells us in his voiceover: ""That wasn't good enough.""

Magnum ambushes Ivan and takes him into the woods at gunpoint. But Ivan tells Magnum that he is a man of fair play and honor and would not shoot an unarmed man. As Ivan moves past Magnum to go back to his limousine, Magnum asks him that question in the title above and then raises his M1911A1 pistol and fires.

I remember watching this episode as a child and being shocked--this was not how TV action heroes behaved in 1982. It was edgy, hardcore stuff for back then. Yet it ultimately fit with Magnum's character of doing what had to be done despite government bureaucracy. It was one act on the small screen something everyone frustrated with kowtowing to evil could enjoy. No wonder that nearly every Magnum fan lists this episode as their favorite.

(Curiously, this incident never came back to haunt Magnum. One can only think Admiral Hawkes and Colonel Greene were happy he acted.)

Every other episode on these three discs are just gravy.",1138752000,15,1893,4.593471810089021
