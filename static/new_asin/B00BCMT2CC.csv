5577990,5,B00BCMT2CC,"So let me get this straight...people are reviewing Wrestlemania 29 before it even happens?  That's like reviewing a game before you play it, or a book before you read it.  It makes zero sense to me, and is pretty hurtful to the events perception to others.  Therefore to fend off all these bogus 1 star reviews, I'll place my own thoughts here with a 5 star review (which I'll be sure to edit once the actual event takes place).  All I really see on this page is a lot of hypocritical and confused fans.  They all cry for the Rock to be there, and he is (as the WWE Champion no less), in a rematch with John Cena to what was arguably the biggest match of all of last year (sorry end of an era), and it's somehow not good enough.  Nope.  You take the biggest rematch WWE has to offer, throw in the WWE championship this time around, and people will actually turn their noses up to it?  You think fans would have done that back in 1991 if Hogan and Warrior had a rematch at WM 7?  Or Bret and Shawn had had their rematch at WM 13?  Not a chance.  But now, with Rock and Cena?  Like I said, makes no sense.

Then you have people crying because the ""Undertaker isn't there""...except anyone actually reading ""dirt sheets"" and believing a month ago that the Undertaker was gone for good is nothing more than a fool.  Of course the Undertaker was gonna be there, this is Wrestlemania after all.  When was the last time Undertaker WASN'T at a WM?  Here's a hint, you'd have to go back THIRTEEN years ago to Wrestlemania 16.  So moving on, yes the Undertaker is back to defend his streak, this time against CM Punk, and yet again somehow this isn't good enough for all the fans out there.  CM Punk isn't ""believable"" enough to beat Taker they say.  Well who has been ""believable"" enough?  The guy is 20-0 for crying out loud.  I don't think anyone with half a head on their shoulders would walk into a Wrestlemania actually believing that Taker was gonna lose that night.  That's not the point of the streak....it's about the build up to the match (which has been decent so far), and watching Taker and his opponent bring out the best in each other for a sure to be classic, which is exactly what is going to happen between him and CM Punk.  So how about just be happy and enjoy the match for what it is?

Nooo though, lemme guess...most people want to see CM Punk in some triple threat match with Rock and Cena.  Yeah, a rematch between Rock and Cena is too much, but a triple threat involving three guys who have faced each other over a dozen times total in the last calendar year WOULD be good enough?  Makes no sense.  And another thing, most triple threat matches in WWE are duds anyway.  It usually ends up being a one-on-one match anyway, with the third guy knocked out of the ring for a while while the other two hit their spots, then they trade off.  Yawn.  No thanks.  I'd rather see a classic rematch, and a new streak match over that any day of the week.

And lastly, you have Brock Lesnar coming back for his first Wrestlemania in 9 years, something that people have been begging for, and what happens?  People find something to complain about and mark this as 1 star.  Big surprise.  Or not.  All I've gotten from reading reviews on here so far is that unless an event that hasn't even taken place yet doesn't conform to some fantasy booker's dream card, then it's not worth watching.  Right, makes a lot of sense doesn't it?",1363564800,13,3430,4.328100470957613
5577991,1,B00BCMT2CC,"The reviewer that said lets not kid ourselves was right on target. Wrestlemania in its present state if presented as the first one back in 1984 would have sent Vince McMahon Jr. to the bankrupsy court. This years Wrestlemania will only be remembered for one thing and that is Bruno Sammartino going into the Hall Of Fame. Years ago Bruno will tell you the story that Hulk Hogan could not fill the houses even though he was touted as this huge star but it was Bruno who was brought out of retirement and ask to wrestle in buildings to bring the attendance up,well what do we have here low and behold here is Bruno once again riding to the rescue to save a Wrestling event which has become boring and the same things over and over again. The man Vince McMahon Jr. who said back in 1983 that his competition meaning the AWA,Mid South,World Class and all the others had become stale now has to look in the mirror and admit that he and his WWE (no longer WWF because McMahon The braintrust forgot to copyright his three initials)have become the same stale boring Wrestling. If TNA was smart this is the time to strike hard and give fans what they want Wrestling not this s*** that the WWE is presenting. Sad to think The WWE was once so inventitive is now just copying everything they did before. Also Vince McMahon a note no one CM PUNKS size could take the Undertaker,the believability is no longer there. To Verne Gange you sad one day McMahon would see happen to him that he did to you and you are so right.",1363305600,6,1506,4.382142857142857
5577992,1,B00BCMT2CC,I have ZERO interest in watching this randomly thrown together card. A couple weeks of building interest in some rematches? Hot shot booking and nonsensical feuds? Pass.,1363219200,6,169,5.296296296296297
5577993,3,B00BCMT2CC,"If it wasn't for Taker/CM Punk and HHH/Brock.  WM would have been a total lost. Vince has totally lost his touch, has since 2009.  Look at the magic of Punk's pipe bomb 2 years ago and how it could have turned the WWE around.  Hell, it could have been the launch of a new bomb period of WWE.  But he p*ssed it away.  That would have never happened 10 years ago.  Never.

WWE will be better off when the ball is past to HHH when he takes over.  Because WWE dropped the ball this WM, period.  Everybody's attention went to soothing the egomaniac's ""Hogan"" sized ego, to a point that, other than 2 above mentioned matches, WM sucked.  It was another WM 13 (only 2 good matches.)  WWE has lost it's  it's focus on the big picture, has for some time.  There's no argument to made here, well not with the truly intelligent fans.  I know that will be some idiot that will argue my post, but just overlook them.  They don't know any better.

WWE won't get any better till they get rid of the two biggest problems they have, Vince and Cena.  Vince is just too old, and Cena is only out of him self and how he wants the fans perceive him.  And we, the smart fans, know this, and I think everyone is too.  I don't agree with the booing during the Make-A-Wish video package because it takes a low person to boo dying kids,  but I knew that was not the intent.  They were booing the fact that Cena only does that to make himself look good, building his ego up even more (""Look at what I'm doing, I'm here visiting dying kids.""  The smart fan sees through all his bs.  He couldn't care less about those kids,  he's a bigger a**hole than Hogan was and still is.  I don't respect anybody uses these kids for there own purposes.  I'm just glad that more fans now are seeing what type of person he truly is.

I got off point,  but the WWE won't get any better till they retire Vince and get rid of Cena.",1363132800,5,1885,4.161111111111111

WRESTLEMANIA 29

I have to be honest and admit that now a days I get more excited for Wrestlemania for the Hall of Fame more so than the event. Not to say that I don't like the events but you get what I am saying. This year the big story for most was the rematch of the ""once in a life time match"" or the streak. For me it was mostly as far as the card goes all about The Shield. Of course my boy HBK was back to be in Triple H's corner against Brock Lesnar.

1. THE SHIELD VS SHEAMUS, RANDY ORTON, & THE BIG SHOW-one of the best matches of the night and a great way to start off the show. I personally love The Shield [I always like groups like this] and thought there were going to come away with the victory here. This was a great match with everyone looking great here. The big thing in this match was if Show's team could get along, or really if Show could get along with them. Of course The Shield worked great together from start to finish ""making the numbers work for them"" as JBL said even with the teams even. That was the story of the match as the other teamed looked like single wrestlers trying to outdo each other. The action was of course fast paced with six men in there but never felt rushed at all. In the end The Shield comes out on top and Show takes it out of his teammate.

2. MARK HENERY VS RYBACK-this was your typical big man versus big man powerhouse match, but the outcome was a little surprising. Mark Henry really controlled most of this match and worked over Ryback's back. Ryback had some spots but for a guy that had been feuding for the WWE title not to long before this I was surprised. Henry ends up winning the match. After the match there may have been a new inductee into the Hall of Pain.

3.[TAG TITLES]TEAM HELL NO VS DOLPH ZIGGLER & BIG E. LANGSTON-another good match that left all four guys looking good here. Langston in his debut looked strong here even taking to Kane and Ziggler was great as always. But it would be the reigning tag champs that came out on top. Kane delivered a big chokeslam here followed by a diving headbutt from Bryan. That lead to the win but it was a back and forth battle and a good match on a good card.

4. CHRIS JERICHO VS FANDANGO-this was the debut of Fandango and I have to say that it was a pretty good one. It was not the best match on the card but it was good and helped put him over. Jericho of course is great and controls most of the match. Still he gets rolled up and Fandango gets that big win at Mania. If it wasn't for Jericho I don't know how Fandango's debut would have gone against someone else.

5.[WORLD TITLE]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS JACK SWAGGER-this was a good match between these two that featured some good back and forth. The submission attempts and counters were great as both tried to outdo the other. Of course Swagger had some help at ringside but it was not enough as he was forced to tap out. This gave Del Rio the victory and he retained his championship.

6. UNDERTAKER VS CM PUNK-talk about a great match and how could it not be with these two guys in there. From the beginning Punk is still as disrespectful as ever to Taker slapping him while Paul still has the urn. They go back and forth the entire match countering and applying each other's signature moves and holds. Of course there are many near falls and highlights throughout the match including Punk going into the table like he did. But fear not Taker fans as he holds on to the streak after defeating Punk with the tombstone.

7.[NO HOLDS BARRED]BROCK LESNAR VS TRIPLE H-I will admit that I was looking forward to this match and a little bit of it was because of HBK being involved. But I also felt that it had a big fight feel to it and honestly looking back that may have been because of Heyman and his mic work. Still this was a good match and felt like a fight especially as the match went on. Both men are brawlers here and the fight went all over the place. But despite Brock being a ""beast"" Triple H was able to get the victory after a pedigree on the steps.

8.[WWE TITLE]THE ROCK VS JOHN CENA-the rematch of the ""once in a life time"" match from the previous year's Mania. Now while this match was a good one and maybe even matches last years as far as the performances go it still felt, well not as big as last year's match. The atmosphere here was of course more so for Rock like last time but even then it didn't feel as big and the crowd didn't seem as into it as the last time. That may be just me but regardless it was still a good match with both guys ""bringing it"". The counters were many and there was a great moment that almost was a repeat of last year. Still Cena comes out on top this time regaining the title, maybe a rubber match is in the future.

BONUS MATCH

1.[I-C TITLE]WADE BARRETT VS THE MIZ-I still have no idea why we got all those commercials and stuff on Mania but this ACTUAL match was on the pre show. Cutting just one of them would have made enough time for the I-C title match as it is short. Both start out strong but it is The Miz that keeps working for that figure four. He eventually locks it in pretty creatively and gets the win and the belt.

You also get the complete Hall of Fame which was excellent this year. It featured the great Bruno Sammartino, one of my all time favorites Booker T, Mick Foley, Trish Stratus, Bob Backland, and Donald Trump. That is one of the best things about this set, maybe the actual best thing. You also get a few other extras like the Q&A with Rock and Cena. This is a great buy for any wrestling fan out there looking to add to the collection. Highly recommended, HOF is always the best on these sets.",1384300800,12,5647,4.18491260349586

Wrestlemania. i get it every year. but, i will say i am a big Brock Lesnar vs Triple H was and is one of the best matches to take place. when something is going on with Brock Lesnar, you know, someone will get hurt. the ending? predictable, in my opinion. ever since Triple H got a REAL job and is in charge of what wrestlers do and how he puts them in charge of their own DVDS/Blu-Ray, things have gotten so much better! i won't go into each match and a rating. its not a bad Wrestlemania , just not one of the best.

5578083,4,B00BCMT2CC,"Overall it was a good but not great Wrestlemania, hurt a lot by its overall predictability. No shocks or surprises but that doesn't mean the card didn't deliver. There weren't really any bad matches per se, and most were pretty good actually. Won't do long recaps as they've already been done so I'll keep mine brief. Had a perfect opener with solid action between The Shield and Orton, Sheamus, and Big Show. My least favorite match was next between Ryback and Henry and I even enjoyed it for what was in my eyes the surprise victor. Team Hell No vs Ziggler and Big E was good given the time they had. Seeing the whole stadium do the yes chants after the match was a cool sight. Jericho gave Fandango a great debut showing as expected. Del Rio against Swagger was just sort of there, nothing special. The hands down match of the night was next with CM Punk vs The Undertaker. If nothing else I can take away from this event I saw this match in person. The atmosphere in the crowd changed the minute they started showing the promo material pre match and were crazy throughout actually kind of burning the crowd out for the rest of the show. Triple H and Brock had a solid match only knocked down a little due to the burnt out crowd. And Rock and Cena kind of ended on an anti climactic moment, was pretty solid toward the end though.

Overall it was a pretty good Mania. There have been far better and far worst but at least to me it was entertaining throughout, just nothing that will stick around in the years to come. Stadium show crowd was different. Chants would break out a lot but in different parts of the stadium and never all at once. That and it was pretty cold which took a little enjoyment out of it for me. This isn't football so when night fell and it was in the 40's you knew it. Wondered how they kept the wrestlers warm but after watching the DVD you can see the heaters up above the ring. The little things that were missing bugged me a little. No America The Beautiful or preshow fireworks. Not that those are important but I noticed them.

5578095,4,B00BCMT2CC,"This year's show was a good solid show,;it just lacked the special something you'd expect of ""The Showcase of the Immortals"".There wasn't a truly bad match and I do appreciate that every match did get at least a few minutes,unlike that 18 second world title match last year. However,I will say last year's show was still a better experience. Part of the reason for that was Rock/Cena 1 at 'Mania 28 was a much better match than Rock/Cena 2 this year. The rematch was just missing something,could've been due to Rock's injury suffered early in the match,or just the fact that we all saw this last year and that was billed as ""Once in a Lifetime"".
Anyway the show stealer was clearly Undertaker vs CM Punk. Those 2 put on an amazing performance taking the audience on a roller coaster ride full of power and emotion with each near-fall and plot twist...2nd best match was the physical battle between Triple H and Brock Lesnar. Those 2 beat the crap out of each other...The Shield vs Orton/Sheamus/Big Show was a really good action packed opener. The tag title match was a lot of fun while it lasted,but under 7 minutes just isn't long enough for a match to really be memorable...Jericho/Fandango was a nice match with a bit of a clunky finish. The great veteran did a good job of bringing the new guy along in his 1st big match...Del Rio/Swagger was a fine but uninteresting wrestling match. The live crowd really wanted a Dolph Ziggler cash-in but didn't get it. No surprise on the finish after the Swagger arrest that happened the month before the show...Ryback/Mark Henry was definitely the least impressive match on the show and I knew it would be. I'll give Ryback credit for the feat of strength ShellShocking Henry.
So there you go. I liked this year's show but just can't say I loved it. Well worth the purchase though for a quality show highlighted by Taker vs Punk and also for a really good star-studded Hall of Fame ceremony. Check it out.",1371254400,,1949,4.619596541786744

- Slow at first, but it does pick up. Cena finally defeats The Rock and gets his redemption. A lot finishers in this match. I give Cena/Rock II, 3/5  stars.

No Holds Barred, Triple H's career is on the line: Triple H battles Brock Lesnar
- Crowd seemed to be dead from the previous match, but I still enjiyed it. Brutal. A lot better then there match at SummerSlam and maybe even better than at Extreme Rules. Triple H gets his revenge after a pedigree on steel steps. 3.5/5

'The Streak' Undertaker takes on CM Punk

Lets run through it by what I saw,

Preshow, Miz Vs Wade Barrett(Champion) for The Intercontinental Championship- **3/4 Was excited when Miz came out, First wrestler I ever saw live.

The Shield Vs. Randy Orton, Sheamus and The Big Show - ***1/2 Match was cool.

Mark Henry Vs. Ryback - **3/4, Alright match, glad to see the wrestlers.

Team Hell No(Kane and Daniel Bryan)(Champions) vs. Dolph Ziggler and Big E. Langston with AJ Lee For The Tag Team Championship - ***, Good match from what I remember, wonderful seeing Kane's pyro live.

Fandango Vs. Chris Jericho -  *** 3/4 -  Loved seeing Jericho, grew up watching him for a long time, very good match.

Alberto Del Rio(Champion) with Ricardo Rodriguez Vs. Jack Swagger with Zeb Colter for The World Heavyweight Championship - *** don't really remember match quality.

The Undertaker Vs. CM Punk(With Paul Heyman) -  Match of The Night, **** 1/2, from entrance to 3 count, crowd loved it, and it was amazing, coming from a guy who doesn't really enjoy Punk.

Triple H(With Shawn Michaels) Vs. Brock Lesnar(With Paul Heyman), No Holds Barred match; If Triple H had lost, he would have been forced to retire. - ****, very exciting match

The Rock(WWE Champion) Vs. John Cena For The WWE Championship - ****1/4, Had it not been for the ending, it would have been amazing.

Overall great show that I was at Live, section 126, just brought the bluray, Prayed to Jesus that I am in it and can see myself, hopefully I can go to Wrestlemania XXX next year.

5578113,4,B00BCMT2CC,"The 2013 Wrestlemania from New York Jets/Giants stadium was one of the most hyped events in Wrestlemania history. Did it meet the hype. As almost always, the answer is NO. I would have been extremely disappointed if I had paid $65 bucks to watch this on PPV. But this a review of the blu ray, which is quite enjoyable.

The event itself was a very full stacked card. Out of all of the matches, in my opinion only 2 were very memorable. I actually really enjoyed the Team Hell No vs. Zigler/Langston for the tag team championship. This match had a twist with AJ and Ziggy at the beginning that resembled AJ and Daniel Bryan from last years Wrestlemania. The other match that I enjoyed was Undertaker vs. CM Punk. This was an instant classic. Undertakers Walking Dead entrance was also very cool. Rock vs. Cena Twice in a Lifetime was extremely overrated. All it was was counters  with finishing moves. That match was very much crap!!!

The video quality of the blu ray is crystal clear, as is the norm for WWE releases. The bonus features are cool, with the pre/post shows and some segments from WWE Raw leading up to Mania. The Hall of Fame is also included.  Overall I would recommend this Wrestlemania. Even though it was highly overhyped it still turned out OK.",1369094400,,1264,4.5550660792951545

5578115,4,B00BCMT2CC,"Honestly I thought this Wrestlemania was fantastic, Idk why people dislike it so much, I thought it was the best Wrestlemania since 2006 with Wrestlemania 22.

Wade Barrett vs. The Miz - WWE Intercontinental Championship - Okay this match was on the pre-show and it deserved to be on the pre-show. It was short and terrible and having Miz win (his 1 day reign with the title) with the figure-4 leg lock was disgusting, 1/5

The Shield vs. Big Show/Randy Orton/Sheamus - 6 Man Tag Match - Although this doesn't live up to Elimination Chamber, but this was a pretty good opener. Very fun and entertaining match, got some wrestling, some brawling, made for a great start. 4/5

Mark Henry vs. Ryback - I normally don't like big man matches but this one I thuroughly enjoyed. Ryback got beat up for most of it and that brings happiness for me. 3/5

Team Hell No vs. Dolph Ziggler & Big E Langston - WWE Tag Team Championship - Okay, I'll admit that this match is very lackluster. I'm glad they finally gave Daniel Bryan a real match at Wrestlemania, but it lagged. 2/5

Chris Jericho vs. Fandango - This match was honestly very good, I don't know if I would have had the same thoughts if I didn't watch the next Raw and watch the rise of Fandango thereafter. But for a mid-card match it was very well done. 3/5

Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger - World Heavyweight Championship - I honestly enjoyed this match, but I wanted to see more. I got so into the match that I was sad when it ended, and it was only 10 minutes. I hoped it would be a 20-minute match. But was a great technical contest 3.5/5

Undertaker vs. CM Punk - Without a doubt the match of the night. Unlike the last 2 years where the Undertaker matches I honestly don't want to watch a second time, this is a match I'd gladly watch over and over again. Just amazing and so well done from start to finish. Course I'm sad that it did not go to 20-1, but was a great match. 5/5

Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar - No Holds Barred Match - Another great match. I really got into this match and the fact that Lesnar did get his butt kicked in the end was awesome. I legitimately don't like Brock Lesnar and to see him suffer just makes me all warm and squishy inside. This is the hardcore match that Wrestlemania needed and it delivered 4.5/5

The Rock vs. John Cena - WWE Championship - This match I will say was much better than last year's. The match at WM28 wasn't bad, but it wasn't a 5-star showstopper as I was hoping. And while this match still isn't a 5-star classic, I will say it was much better than last year. Tons of counters, they attempted each others finishing moves (which I really wanted to see last year) and I thought was just better match overall. 3.5/5

The storylines: Fantastic storylines this time around. The Taker/Punk storyline with the use of Paul Bearer's death was controversial and so well done. The short build for Cena vs. Rock was not as good as last year, but that had a year to build, this built in only a month and I thought Cena did his best work in the weeks building up to the match. HHH/Lesnar was very well done, hell I'll even say the build for the World Title match was superb! One of the few times I'll make sure to sit down cause I wanted to hear the stuff between Zeb Colter & Alberto Del Rio.

The concerts: The P-Diddy concert was absolutely brutal. The worst of the night, it felt very phoned-in and lackluster. But then I saw the Living Colour concert and was absolutely blown away by awesomeness. When I brought the dvd home that's the first thing I wanted to watch. But the Diddy one was terrible. I'd rather have Limp Bizkit getting booed like crazy at Wrestlemania 19, I'd rather have Flo Rida getting booed like crazy last year.

Overall: I thought this event was very well done. One thing WWE gets attacked on is lack of wrestling, this event had no backstage interviews, no dumb ""entertainment"" segments (and yes the 8-person tag match was undelivered), and no real celebrity involvement (referring to celebrities getting in the ring and competing in a match). This event was about the wrestling, the crowd was awesome, this crowd didn't feel as Anti-Cena as Wrestlemania's in the past (which I'm sick of hearing honestly). It lacked in a couple places but I think this Wrestlemania was overall very good, despite popular opinions.

For the DVD: It has the event, the 22 minute post-show, and the entire WWE Hall of Fame 2013 (which runs 3 and 1/2 hours). Mick Foley's part is on Disc 2 and the rest is on Disc 3.

Match 6 CM Punk vs Undertaker: The best match on the card and maybe of the year epic match as Undertaker puts his 20-0 Streak on the line, IMO my 3rd favorite Undertake match at Wrestlemania behind Take vs HBK at WM 25 and Taker vs HHH WM28. Match Rating 9.5/10

Alberto Del Rio vs Jack Swagger (World Heavyweight Championship): Big and hot promo, sad and short match.

CM Punk VS The Undertaker: The Best in the World VS The Best at WrestleMania. Great back and forward action including lots of counters and using each others moves such as ""Old School"".
- [10/10] The best thing to watch in the event.

Triple H vs Brock Lesnar (No Holds Barred Match. If Triple H loses, he must retire): Hahaha! It was made a ""No DQ Match"", and yet there wasn't really any No DQ style action. Boring.

5578121,1,B00BCMT2CC,"this WM blew donkey pole. Undertaker vs Punk was good, but for all the trash talking Punk does and really thinks he is the best, he is a damn sloppy worker at times. Cena and Rock...ugh. ENOUGH of these 2 imbeciles. There is no magic in WM like there was back in the good ole days like Savage v Steamboat or Hogan v Andre. Everything today is over sold and booked horribly. This WM is a perfect example of why the WWE is old hat and worst yet, too predictable. Not one surprise. garbage story telling. THe one bright spot the WWE has is the Shield. otherwise, WWE is stale and this show is a perfect example of stale wrestling. oops, i mean sports entertainment.",1367107200,6,662,4.304
5578122,2,B00BCMT2CC,"For a long time, many consider Wrestlemania 2000 as one of the worst in recent years or overall but that record has been shattered by this year's Wrestlemania. Too many issues and flaws that won't make this one very memorable. First problem was a lot of missed opportunities to Define the Event like Randy Orton turning heel or Dolph Ziggler cashing in his Briefcase. None of the matches weren't really memorable or monumental because there weren't any defining moments to put the Exclamation Point. Another issue was not all Championship Titles were on the Card. That is a very big problem because Annually and Traditionally all titles are up for grabs and they all should be whether they are major or minor. Winning, Defending, Retaining or Losing a Championship Title still brings Value to the Event and each of them deserve a spot on the Card and not on Pre-Shows. The obvious problem was how Predictable most matches but mainly the 3 Main Events. The Rock/Cena match was far impressive than last year's. Triple H winning wasn't a big surprise and same goes for The Undertaker heading into 21-0. Overall Wrestlemania this year had some pretty decent quality into the Matches but they won't be kept in recent memory for long.",1367107200,,1228,4.8246445497630335
5578123,5,B00BCMT2CC,"This year's Wrestlemania had its good parts. But all in all, it wasn't quite up to Wrestlemania standards. Not in my opinion. The title of this review though foretell my feelings about how things went down. The sets, the stadium, the atmosphere, the sounds, everything was worth it. The Hurricane Sandy segment that was shown before the PPV intro was amazing. The PPV intro was as well.

Miz vs. Wade Barrett - Pre-show match for the I.C. Title

Should have been on the PPV itself. Especially since that originally advertised 8 person Tag was cancelled.

The Shield vs. Randy Orton, Sheamus and Big Show

Awesome WM debut for The Shield. They really shined here.

Mark Henry vs. Ryback

Match sucked. But the after-match Shellshocked got the crowd on its feet.

Team Hell No vs. Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston

I'm glad Team Hell No won. JR always spoke highly of Langston so I expected more out of him that what he actually gave us. Kane's pyros should be witnessed live as they are quite a sight.

Fandango vs. Chris Jericho

I'm still against anyone debuting at WM. But to his credit, Fandango has caught on. Question is, will his fame last? I've always respected Jericho's work and was a fan of his. But he gained more respect out of me for furthering someone else's career than his own.

Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger - WHC

Still don't feel Swagger deserved to be at WM following his arrest. But Del Rio really brought the best out of him. Loved the finish to the match.

The Undertaker vs. CM Punk

Match of the night. Considering it is Taker, it doesn't surprise me that this match, even with two guys less than 100% and one of them only wrestling once a year, managed to be the real highlight of the night. For me, this was worth the price of admission alone because I've been a Taker fan as long as I can remember and this was the first time I saw him wrestle live. The match and what followed were awesome. But for even the casual Taker fan, do not pass up the chance to see this icon live because his entrance is something you'll want to capture on film (or video if you can) because it will be an epic sight. And one you'll back on years after he leaves the wrestling world.

Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar - No Holds Barred (If HHH lost, his career would end)

Of all the top-billed matches, I thought Rock-Cena II would be the letdown. But actually, this match turned out to be the letdown. Really disappointed and wil lskip this one when I get the bluray.

John Cena vs. The Rock - WWE Championship

Overall, I found this to be so-so. It definitely had its moments and the crowd were on their feet more than once. But I felt their first match which I did not see live came off better.

WM weekend was a real treat for me this year as I did something most cannot say they have - go to WM live on Sunday and two days prior, attend Axxess for the first time. Got to meet Gerald Briscoe and Terry Funk and they were awesome experiences. But the real treat was meeting Taker which was the sole reason I even went and it was an unforgettable experience to say the very least. He autographed the Undertaker Special Limited Edition magazine that was released back in 2003, a decade ago. I cannot say in words how nice the man was. It never ceases to amaze me how different the real-life Taker is from the one in the ring. Its like two different people when in reality, its actually the same guy.",1367020800,,3403,4.356012658227848
5578124,2,B00BCMT2CC,"Okay. I fell for it. All week leading up to WrestleMania I was thinking, okay, maybe I should order the PPV. Maybe WWE will swerve me, the viewer, for once. Boy, was I wrong. Garbage. Its like walking into a movie and already knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen based off the trailers. You go in to the movie having positive thoughts, thinking, ""Maybe I'm wrong"" and then the movie is over and you were EXACTLY right. You weren't wrong about the outcome at all. And you should have maybe just skipped out on that movie and waited for a good one to come out a couple weeks later. The three main events, which sold the PPV for everybody to watch were: CM Punk vs The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar vs Triple H 2, and The Rock vs John Cena 2 but this time for the WWE Championship. Okay. Big scale main events,  and the talent surrounding the biggest wrestling event of the year. The show started out strong with The Shield vs Sheamus, Randy Orton & the Big Show. No complaints here. Good, solid opener. The biggest complaint people had about this was Orton didn't turn heel (bad guy). To them I say, shut up. A good match just happened and you just missed it because you were worried about a heel turn. Boo f'n hoo. The show went on. Really nothing special about it until the first of three main events of the evening. CM Punk vs The Undertaker. The almighty streak vs the Best in the World. This match was an instant classic. One WrestleMania match we'll still be talking about at WrestleMania 39! Wow. The crowd was dead until this match and then they came alive. And I don't blame this. This was a good match to come alive at. And then after the match, the crowd died again. HHH-Lesnar 2 was horrible. Can you blame them. Then Cena-Rock 2 and the event was over and the crowd was extremely happy it was over. It was painfully obvious who was winning what and besides, Punk-Taker, nobody delivered to make the obvious, worth it. Worst WrestleMania I've seen. And I sat through WrestleMania 26. That was horrible.",1366934400,,2010,4.4324324324324325
5578125,2,B00BCMT2CC,"Blu-ray is to have the full-length Raw from the next night on it.  Wrestlemania 29 was a disappointment this year.  I am not gonna go over all the matches but instead go over what I didn't like and what I did like.

What I did like.

1.  CM Punk vs Undertaker - This match felt like a Mania match.  In fact it was the only Mania caliber match on the card.  Taker looked slow, but Punk was easily able to carry him even when he hurt his leg off a botched elbow drop through the announce table.  The only downside to this match was that it was predictable.  There were some nearfalls, but not near enough that you would think that Punk would actually win the match.  Easily a 4 star match.

2.  Fandango.  I liked Johnny Curtis, and he has been misused badly by the WWE.  With this new gimmick he can show his intensity, charisma, and still have a joke as a gimmick.  He can take this character in many directions and I feel that he will be star sooner than later.  He defeated Chris Jericho which made him look good for his debut, and can easily say that he is the first WWE star to win a debut match at Mania.

3.  The Raw after.  Any fan will tell you that Raw was much better than Mania.  It is sad that a 'free' show was better than a $70 ppv.  Regardless, if this is added on the disk, I am sure it will get the sales it needs, and I would buy it just for the full length Raw.  It had moments on that show that should of been at Mania.  Ziggler cashing in, Ryback turning heel, the fans trolling Orton and Sheamus.  Classic.

Dislikes:

1.  Big Show turning heel (AGAIN!) - Everybody was expection Orton to turn heel during or after the match against The Shield, but no, WWE decided to make Big Show a bad guy again.  Lame.

2.  Brock Lesnar vs Triple H - I am sick of Triple H sticking his nose into things that doesn't belong.  There match was no good.  The fans were dead through out the whole match, and it was nothing but an underglorified street fight.  It was clear with Lesnar's body actions that he didn't want to lose the match but it was a retirement match and this match was very predictable because who would honestly want to lose to Brock Lesnar for their final match.

3.  Ryback vs Mark Henry - From the very beginning of this feud, I knew this match was going to be a dud.  Mark Henry went over, and then Ryback gets up and shell shocked him after the match.  Honestly, Ryback should of won the match.  This match was poorly booked and was sloppy.  I would of much rather see Brock Lesnar vs Ryback.  Since Ryback was going to lose anyways, the WWE could of made Lesnar happy with a win, and would of given Ryback a strong loss at Mania.  Horrible booking on WWE's part.

4.  To many commercials.

5.  P. Diddy.

6.  Cena vs The Rock - Well, the match was not good at all.  Nothing but finishing moves and signature moves through out the match.  Both men knew that their match sucked and blamed injuries for it which we all know is bull.  Cena didn't turn heel, and just plain awful.",1366416000,,3004,4.166083916083916
5578126,1,B00BCMT2CC,"this was the most boring and predictable wrestlemania of all time. the only decent matches were undertaker vs punk and hhh vs lesnar, everything else was garbage, please do not buy this bluray just look up the matches I mentioned and watch them on youtube. I have seen every wrestlemania since the year 2000 and this was the worst one ever, it didn't even feel like wrestlemania it felt like night of champions or something. please save your money!",1366329600,2,448,4.6835443037974684
5578127,5,B00BCMT2CC,"For those who have been so very critical about this year's show of shows, I ask you this. Were you entertained? I must say that in spite of all the fanboy rants, the sometimes tired crowd and overall stigma that was in place before the event even came to pass, I was THOROUGHLY entertained by WrestleMania XXIX. I thought the undercard featured solid matchups that were well paced and fun. I loved Punk v Undertaker and would put it in early contention for Match of the Year. Lesnar v HHH was great, and only suffered a slower pace due to Brock's concussion and Trips second degree burns. The Rock v Cena rematch was predictable, but that last ten minutes was exciting whether you want to admit it or not. False finishes always keep you on the edge of your chair. It may not have been the greatest ever, but I love every Mania for what it is that year, the best PPV on the calendar.",1366156800,10,882,4.351515151515152

5578129,5,B00BCMT2CC,This Mania had an amazing atmosphere and a solid card. Three great main events and some solid under-card matches. WWE also made Met-Life look amazing and the pyro/music/atmosphere was incredible.  Get this Blu Ray!,1365811200,3,214,5.294117647058823
5578130,4,B00BCMT2CC,"Just to be clear this is a review of the WM show and not the dvd which has not been released yet. As far as my thoughts on this Mania:  I thought it was really good, however, once again time constraints almost ruined the show yet again.  There were many things that were cut from this show such as the singing of America the Beautiful, lots of backstage segments and interviews as well as entrances from the Rock and John Cena.  This has become a problem for many years now and it makes no sense to me.  It's not like this was the first or second Mania, it was the 29th.  Shouldn't Vince and company know how to properly fill time by now?  Anyway, let's talk about the show of shows.

The show opened with New Jersey Governor Christie giving an opening promo and then there was a WM opening promo.  After that, the opening match started with Big Show, Sheamus and Randy Orton taking on The Shield.  I was very surprised that this was the opening match but it was a very good way to begin the show.  Lots of action and I was very impressed by the Shield, all of whom were involved in their very first Mania.  Great match but no shocks.  I had heard for weeks that Orton was going to turn heel at this show and when the match was over, he was still a face while Big Show was the one that ""turned.""  I use that term loosely because wasn't he really a heel anyway.  Still great match that went a little over 10:00.  (8/10)

After that we get a history package of the events that led up to the Main Event.  We then get Mark Henry's entrance followed by some short footage of Henry vs. Ryback.  So after all that we see the Mark Henry vs. Ryback match.  There were so many people who hated this match because it was too slow or what have you and my response is:  What the hell did you expect?  This was going to be a power match and that's what it was.  There were a lot of big time hits in the match and I for one liked it.  I think it could have been better especially the ending and the person going over but it was still fun to watch.  I also liked that it wasn't too long and wasn't too short clocking in at a little over 8:00.  (8/10)

After that match we see a commercial, then some special Olympics introductions, then another commercial from WWE, then the ring entrance of Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston and then finally just some footage of Big E.  After all that was done it was on to the WWE Tag title match pitting Ziggler and Big E against Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan).  This was a good match but a little too short for me.  I do like the fact that right in the beginning of the match they tried to play off of what happened last year with AJ and Bryan where he lost the match in 18 seconds after she kissed him.  The same thing almost happened this year after she kissed Dolph.  I thought he and Bryan had the best parts of the match but I have to tell you, Big E impressed me.  I wasn't sure what to expect but he was good.  Again the match was short clocking in at a little over 6:00 but for the time they were given, it was good.  (7/10)

So after this match we get yet another WWE commercial, that was followed by the entrance of Fandango (which actually was pretty good), then we get a brief history package of Fandango vs. Chris Jericho.  So of course the next match was Fandango vs. Chris Jericho.  Honestly, I hated this match.  It was so bad.  I feel bad for Jericho that he was involved in this one.  They should have had Chris taking on someone else and save Fandango for someone lower on the card.  I was expecting a good showing from Fandango being that they saved his debut for Mania but it was crap.  There wasn't a whole lot I liked about this one.  I hate to say it, cause I am a huge Jericho fan, but this could have been the worst match on the show.  (4/10)

After this match we yet another WWE commercial, some footage of the IC title match that happened on the pre show, a video package of The Rock, a hip hop performance by Diddy and finally a history package of Del Rio against Swagger.  After all that we get to see the WWE World Heavyweight title match between Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger.  Again, to me, this was another let down.  I thought the match was boring and too slow.  I didn't like that Del Rio won and I sure didn't like that Dolph didn't turn his Money in the Bank in like I thought he would.  I mean there were some cool moments in the match but not good enough for it to be considered a great Mania match.  (5/10)

Once again we are treated to yet another WWE commercial followed up by the events that led up to the Taker/Punk match.  The entrances that both these guys had were great.  You had Punk being sung to the ring by the band that sings his song, In Living Color, I think is the name.  Taker had a good one as well that had him in silhouette with what looked like people reaching for him out of their graves.  The match itself was awesome.  It was back and forth, just an emotional rollercoaster.  Great action.  I really liked the fact that Punk actually performed the Old School on Taker.  I also enjoyed the elbow off the top rope onto the announce table by Punk to Taker.  The ending was somewhat abrupt but it was still worth the price of the show itself.  Great match and maybe an early contender for Match of the Year.  (10/10)

So after this match we get another stellar WWE commercial (can you sense the sarcasm yet?), then a video package of John Cena and lastly the events that led up to the No Holds Barred match.  I loved Brock Lesnar's entrance and Triple H had a good one as well.  Shawn Michaels, who was with Triple H (as his career was on the line) also had a special entrance.  I see some people on the internet hated this match but I freaking loved it.  To me this was the match of the night.  It was so brutal.  Chairs were used and the announce table and the sledgehammer and the steel steps.  Just a brutal match.  Brock was spot on for this one and I was somewhat shocked that he didn't win.  I thought Triple H would lose, take over the day to day operations in the WWE and be inducted into the Hall of Fame next year but it was not to be.  I do think this match was better than Summerslam and maybe another contender for Match of the Year.  One thing I was glad of is that they didn't let Shawn take any of Triple H's shine in the match.  Shawn got destroyed by Brock and the only thing he really did was superkick Paul Heyman.  That was good booking on WWE's part.  Having Brock lose though I think was bad booking.  I just think he should have taken Triple H's career and then maybe started a world title run.  Still, it was a great match and I for one can't wait to see who Brock will take on next.  (10/10)

After that match we get a commercial for the next PPV Extreme Rules followed by a movie trailer.  After that we get some footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony followed by the introduction of the Hall of Fame class of 2013.  To me this may be the best class yet.  You had Mick Foley going in, Booker T going in, Donald Trump going in the celebrity wing, Trish Stratus being inducted, one of my all time favorites Bob Backlund and last but not least Bruno Sammartino.  Once again with the WWE we learn to never say never.  I never thought I would see Bob or Bruno inducted but there they are right where they should be.  Great class this year and can't wait for the dvd release so I can see all of their inductions.

Once that was done we get a showing as to where WM 30 will be (New Orleans if you haven't heard).  I sure hope we don't get a Superbowl repeat with the lights going out.  Also we find out the attendance for this Mania was 80,676 making it the second largest Mania crowd in history.

Once that was done it was on to the Main Event with The Rock taking on John Cena for the WWE championship.  Again I guess they ran out of time because both of the entrances were abrupt.  There was no special entrances for either superstar.  The match itself was very good.  I hear a lot of people talking about how much better it was than last year but I have to disagree.  I think this match was very very good but not as good as last year's.  There was no shocks here, I think we all knew who was going to win before it happened.  In fact I think most people knew who was going to win back in January.  I still have this feeling that they may meet again next year for the rubber match.  Still, great match with a lot of twists and turns.  There were a ton of false finishes and using the other's finishing holds.  Good match.  (10/10)

So all in all this was a very good WM from start to finish.  I hated all the commericals that happened and I did hate the fact that time constraints did once again play a factor in this Mania, but all that being said, this is a good Mania and one worth checking out.  Can't wait for the dvd to see what they include with the special features and also what they edit out.  All in all I would give this Mania a 9/10.  There were some bad matches but most of them were good to excellent.  Can't wait for next year!",1365811200,5,9057,4.118993135011442
5578131,5,B00BCMT2CC,"There are some very critical reviews of this event, but I had ringside seats and can say for most of the time we were standing! Yes, the main event was predictable but the Undertaker vs. Punk and Lesnar/HHH matches were a least as good as any matches I have seen in a long long time. The set was absolutly stunning!",1365811200,,315,4.266666666666667
5578132,2,B00BCMT2CC,"Even though WWE's Pay Per Views are getting slowly, but surely, more uninteresting, ever year's Wrestlemania is usually great entertainment, and once a year, it also features good wrestling (if WWE knows what that term means anymore).
Last year especially had some good storylines and build-ups, and also great matches. This year, however, nothing of the kind happened, the failure of WWE's creative team showed in the Road to Wrestlemania, the weekly shows, the PPV itself, and the events surrounding it. It's as if nobody concerned themselves with the actual event until the end of February. Storylines were built clumsily, or in the case of the main event, barely at all, matches were thrown together randomly, of which the outcomes had to be utterly predictable.

In the pre-show, The Miz defeated Wade Barrett for the IC Title. How such a match didn't make the main card, especially since at the main show, only 3 Championships were decided, is a mystery. Barrett won the title back the next night, so the bitter suspicion arises that the IC title was merely a pawn to push the pre-show. How great, since the titles mean SO much in WWE these days already.

Big Show, Randy Orton, Sheamus Vs The Shield opened the show. Given how brilliant WWE creative built the match, there was no way the nWo light would not pick up the victory. And in true WWE fashion, the storyline was not resolved, and nothing was accomlished, except to further weaken The Shield.

Henry Vs Ryback was on paper already worst match on the card, and it didn't dissapoint. Whoever came up with this bald-headed tranquillizer, Ryback, should be fired at once. An immovable, unathletic copy of Goldberg, that someone put the pyjamas of RVD on to make sure he would never, ever be taken serious.
Now, Henry on the other side has the clear advantage of charisma over Ryback, so his body language and intensity at least made the match avoid the range between zero and minus one stars.

The first of very few highlights of the night came with Team Hell No Vs Ziggler and Langston for the Tag Titles. The pairing of Daniel Bryan and Kane must be that one kernel that blind hens are said to occasionally find. The two are a hell of a team and draw reactions that just get your blood going. With Ziggler as an opponent, and AJ (by the way by far the prettiest woman on WWE TV), even the atrocity that is Big E Langston doesn't dissapoint. The match, just like many others, was just way too short.

Now we get to the travesty that is Chris Jericho Vs Fandango. Reportedly, Fandango made Wrestlemania because Vince himself is a fan of him. What a pity. A guy that didn't show any wrestling abilities at all in the weekly shows, and of whom we don't know anything except that his name is Fandango and has a fancy entrance makes the WM card, and has to be dragged through the match by top talent Chris Jericho, who has to lose as a thank you gift. What a waste of 10 minutes and Jericho's talent. Just a hint at WWE creative: Dolph Ziggler made Jericho's contract expire half a year ago, and this was played to at the Royal Rumble. Any idea for a showstealer match here? No? Well, I gave you a chance.

Now we have to endure the bored performance of Diddy Kong, or whatever this guy is called, while hard-working Antonio Cesaro, US CHAMPION mind you, Cody Rhodes, Damien Sandow and Brodus Clay had to watch Wrestlemania on TV screens. If I have to endure one more rap/rock/pop act in a WM, I'm going to puke all over the TV set.

Alberto Del Rio Vs Jack Swagger for the Heavyweight Title. Personally, I find Alberto Del Rio the best performer WWE has right now, right behind CM Punk and Ziggler, a hell of a charismatic guy, graceful and convincing in the ring, with a great manager and fantastic looks. He only has the bad luck to be paired with guys like Big Show, or in this case Jack Swagger. Swagger, a lifelong midcarder, in a WM main event, is truly a sight to behold. These moronic yells ""We the people"" make me cringe long and hard.
As usual, too little time was given to the two to really make a worthwhile match. The ending was really boring.

CM Punk Vs The Undertaker. It's fascinating how Taker somehow manages to steal the show every year at Wrestlemania even though people doubt his in-ring performance every time. What we have here are two incredible workers in the ring, two great characters, and two people who can live their gimmicks. Easily the best match of the night, even though it doesn't reach Taker's battles with Shawn Michaels in the last years. They also had the questionable fortune to be given an acceptable storyline that came with the death of William Moody (Paul Bearer). God forbid the atrocity the WWE soap writers would have come up with. Also, please consider that this match was uncertain for a long time!

Lesnar Vs HHH for HHH's carreer. Whoever thought that HHH would lose to Lesnar again, and at WM at that, is stupider than Brock Lesnar looks. Considering Lesnar's last WM appearance was his epic, disastrous encounter with Goldberg at WM XX, this one wasn't half bad, but nothing to write home about. One can look at PG however one likes, but to have a no holds barred match, on PPV no less, between two killing machines (in story), and don't include anything that resembles a form of violence is really dissapointing. A match doesn't need blood to be good, but when the two contestants are clearly not capable of creating a good match on their own, a little gimmick help would be more than welcome. The match only gained momentum in the last 5-10 minutes, beforehand it was just slow as an elephant wading through liquid rubber. HHH was never the best wrestler, and Lesnar seems to just have forgotten.
No more HHH at Wrestlemania!
Oh, I almost forgot, Shawn Michaels was standing at ringside. Why? Because WWE is painfully obvious out of ideas.

Now to the main event.
How this match was promoted, if you can call it that, is nothing but a joke. WWE seemed to just assume that the match would sell itself. But how? Nobody likes Cena, and nobody gets to cheer for Rocky if he isn't at RAW. Last year was indeed special. This time, it seemed like nothing but a marketing ploy. To all the people writing this match down, consider that The Rock seriously injured himself early on, and was therefor not able to pull off many spots, and it had to be restructured. Also, John Cena suffered from food poisoning, you can clearly see that he is very pale in his face. For that, it was a good match. But still not anywhere near the quality of last year's.
A heel turn of Cena was discussed (he even made fun of it next night on RAW), but it didn't happen.
So, this WM concluded with no surprise whatsoever, no true highlight (except Punk/Taker), and chaos.

As if that card wasn't average enough, WWE screwed up big time on the timetable. When Diddy came out to perform, the show already was more than 15 minutes behind schedule, so that all the backstage segments were axed, as well as the 8 Man Tag Match between Rhodes Scholars, the Funkadactyls and the divas. With a show on which the matches were all already on the short side, how can such a huge mix-up happen? To make matters worse, they didn't bother to cut the endless Rock/Cena promos, or the numerous ads (really, who the hell buys a folding chair for 80 bucks?), or the insufferable self-promoting videos, but integral parts of the show!
As far as the wrestling aspect is concerned, only one match, Punk Vs Taker, reaches the 4 out of 5 stars mark, and I won't even try to imagine what the show would have been like, had WWE decided to not squeeze Taker in at the last minute. Cena/Rock and HHH/Lesnar were good, the rest of the matches were on a level that barely edges out RAW's weekly quality.",1365724800,2,7758,4.538241601143674
5578133,5,B00BCMT2CC,"Normally I wait until the end to give my summary but based off how normally people judge WrestleMania (just looking at some of these reviews alone), I'll just give it now.  Now I'm not just strictly talking about the top matches/main events but I'm also talking about the entire show from start to finish when I make this statement but this has been the best overall WrestleMania in the past two years because this year WWE eliminated a high majority of the problems that have been a problem with WrestleMania as they eliminated the useless non-entertaining backstage skits (although we did still have to deal with a music performance which I'll get to later), the celebrity match didn't exist, the really short filler matches (like an 18 second World Title match) was nowhere to be seen, and there wasn't a bad match on here as each one entertained me for how it was designed to be & I wasn't bored one time.  I personally wouldn't have chosen certain talents to be on the show like others have made clear but it is what it is, can't change that & I won't let that cloud my judgment in what I feel was the best Mania show from start to finish in at least the past two years.

I also bumped it up a star for the Hall Of Fame ceremony as it was the overall strongest class in quite some time while each speech (based off the reports & TV special) being quality in it's own right from Terry Funk inducting Mick Foley who had various cameos appearances throughout his speech including a special moment between Chris Jericho & C.M. Punk, Stephanie McMahon inducting a pregnant Trish Stratus, Maria Menounos (who got a pretty bad reception from the New York crowd) inducting her real life close friend Bob Backlund who's induction was the likes we haven't seen since The Iron Sheik's, Vince McMahon inducting Donald Trump, the Harlem Heat reunion with Stevie Ray inducting Booker T, and the long overdue induction of Bruno Sammartino by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

A couple more notes on the actual show itself in that WWE skipped the singing of ""America The Beautiful"" in order to show a video presentation in regards to the effects of Hurricane Sandy, video packages leading up to Rock vs. Cena match were shown throughout the night, various tweets from superstars & fans were shown at the bottom of the screen during the first half of the show, Sean Combs (Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy...whatever the hell his name is now) did a live performance, Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. The Miz was the pre-show match while the six person tag with Tons Of Funk & Funkadellics vs. Team Rhodes Scholars & Bella Twins was bumped to the next night on RAW.

Matches Include:
Sheamus, Randy Orton, Big Show vs. The Shield - Sheamus & Orton started off in control working together as a team before Big Show tagged himself in & went as far to rip the vest off Dean Ambrose to deliver his chops to the chest but The Shield gained the advantage by taking Show's legs out & keeping him down while making quick tags keeping a fresh man in while also knocking Orton off the apron at one point to stop Show from making the tag.  Sheamus was able to finally get in & followed Big Show's lead by ripping off the vest of another Shield member to beat on their chest with Ambrose getting another dose of a beating across his chest but the numbers game would eventually catch up in favor of The Shield such as Seth Rollins suicide dive onto Orton or Sheamus being setup for the triple powerbomb.  The action picked up between everyone towards the end that was one missile of a suicide dive, a huge spear that took a bunch of people down, and an RKO in mid-air as this was a fun opening match that continued to showcase The Shield as a collective team while also telling the story leading into the match about weather Show could be trusted or not.

Ryback vs. Mark Henry - Both men attempted to knock the other down early only to stalemate before Henry was finally able to do it to take advantage working over Ryback's back with multiple bearhugs while sending him to the floor various times either over the top rope or off the apron but Ryback tried fighting back taking Henry down with a powerful clothesline & getting Henry up for Shellshock.  With both men being very limited, they kept this match short which was for the better because it did it's job in establishing both men's strength & power but also had Ryback in a heavy defensive position & showing pain from being worked over which we aren't used to seeing from him.

Tag Team Champions Team Hell No vs. Dolph Ziggler & Big E. Langston - This was not only the WrestleMania debut but the televised in-ring debut period of Carlton Banks...I mean Big E. Langston while J.B.L. also pointed out that this was the 10th straight WrestleMania appearance of Kane.  This match started off in what was openly a flashback from Daniel Bryan & A.J. from a year ago that saw Daniel Bryan respond with what he received last year but also a suicide dive onto the outside before Big E. was tagged in & dominated with his power against both Bryan & Kane including catching Kane with repeated backbreakers while never letting go of him before just running into Kane knocking him down.  Both teams continued to trade momentum with offensive moves such as Dolph's fameasser, Kane catching someone in mid-air with an uppercut & later deliver a chokeslam that had some height on it, big splash by Big E., and Daniel Bryan's flying headbutt.  This was another match that didn't go very long but was very good & one of the best tag matches in recent weeks.

Chris Jericho vs. Fandango - Just like the previous match with Langston, this was not only the WrestleMania debut but also the televised in-ring debut of Fandango which started out with Jericho taking him down with punches & even hitting the codebreaker early as Jericho continued to go after Fandango with a baseball slide & crossbody from the top rope but somehow ended up with a cut on his forehead.  Fandango was able to catch a break catching Jericho in mid-move before Jericho was able to recover as both men went aerial at one point with a flying crossbody & top rope legdrop while Fandango was able to once again take advantage of an opening due to Jericho's misfortune.  There's an old saying about ""wrestling with a broom"" as this match was mostly Chris Jericho showing why he's ""the best at what he does"" as he was in control for majority of the match while Fandango was able to not drop the ball with the wrestling he did while also doing little things to keep putting over his character.

World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger - Just a few notes here in that Jack Swagger's entrance was cut for time while Ricardo Rodriquez was out on crutches due to an attack by Swagger weeks earlier causing Del Rio to come in very aggressive beating on Swagger in & out of the ring resulting in Zeb causing a distraction for Swagger to come back with moves like the Swagger Bomb.  Both men went back & forth with moves like a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker, Backstabber out of the corner,  a back suplex landing the other directly on his head, and the gutwrench powerbomb while later both men exchanging counters to the cross armbreaker & Patriot Lock.  This was a very nice match between the two that saw some good wrestling & good exchanges between their two submission holds.

Undertaker vs. C.M. Punk - Punk made his entrance with the group Living Colour performing ""Cult Of Personality"" while Paul Heyman had the urn symbolizing the late-Paul Bearer with Punk continuing to disrespect Undertaker tossing the urn around & even slapping Taker in the face causing Taker to respond in a dominate fashion with his strikes & big boot while driving Punk back first into the ring post & ""vintage"" apron legdrop before Punk was able to catch Taker off guard during Old School only for Punk to continue to show disrespect for Taker & taking it to the air with top rope moves like his Savage Elbow including one to the outside that ended up hurting himself just as much or even more than it did Taker.  Both men continued to trade momentum by trading blows or using their various trademark moves such as the Anaconda Vice, G.T.S., Tombstone, and Last Ride with the other men somehow continuing to find a way to counter or escape the hold which resulted in the best match these two have had against each other & heavily surpassing their feud back in 2009.

No Holds Barred Match: Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar - With Triple H's career on the line, Shawn Michaels returned to be in Triple H's corner while Paul Heyman was in Brock's while Triple H's entrance didn't go as well as expected resulting in him receiving second degree burns.  Both men started out very aggressively to the point where they were on the floor in less than a minute with Brock being sent into the barricade & announce table before Brock retaliated sending Triple H into the post & over the barricade as they continued to take turns just beating the hell out of each other on the floor from the head bouncing off the steel steps to being slammed through the spanish table.  Brock took control constantly beating on Triple H with repeated throws before Brock changed his focus towards Shawn allowing Triple H to regain the advantage with a spinebuster & bringing a chair into the match at one point as both men began going back & forth delivering a pedigree & F5 followed by more use of the steel chair & ringside steps & ring post as they targeted each others arm using the Kamora Lock & both men finding ways to break the hold.  This surpassed their SummerSlam match months earlier as this did come off as a personal fight with both men not only delivering a beating to each other while telling a story but each of the managers at ringside playing a role into the match as well.

WWE Champion The Rock vs. John Cena - Both men started off with various stalemates early as each man was able to take the other man down before Cena whipped Rock hard into the corner where you saw it take an effect allowing Cena to ground Rock & keep him down with suplexes & slams.  Momentum started to trade as both men knew each other so well from their previous match that they had a counter for each other's offense from the spinebuster to five knuckle shuffle to even submissions like the STF & sharpshooter as they continued to try to one up each other eventually hitting their moves after multiple attempts along with the strong finishers like the Rock Bottom & Attitude Adjustment before going back to trading fist & even stealing the other guys signature moves to the point where you saw a moment of ""deva vu.""  I have to give credit & respect to both men as they've only had one other match against each other in their careers which was a year ago yet was able to come out & deliver a completely different match against each other that also played off the effects of the match a year earlier plus as we would later find out that The Rock got seriously injured early in the match to the point where he needed surgery yet still went so knowing that now, I'll give it more credit.

Other DVD extras include the pre-show match between Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. The Miz & the post-show while the Blu-Ray extras include the Triple H/Brock Lesnar contract signing, C.M. Punk's promo on ending the streak, and the legends Q&A session with The Rock & John Cena.

I already gave my ""bottom line"" in the beginning that this was the best Mania PPV from top to bottom in at least the past two years as far as quality goes regardless of who won what match or who was on the card so if you can get past that part then this is a show I would go out of my way to see.",1365552000,8,11695,4.520586843350686
5578134,2,B00BCMT2CC,"Boy, where to start on this..  I guess I should begin by saying that based on the horrible bookings for this card, I didn't have the highest hopes for this WM, and that indeed proved to hold up.

The pre-show (which was completely unnecessary as WWE devoted an ENTIRE episode of Smackdown a few days prior to hyping up the show) had Wade Barrett lose his IC title to the Miz.  Two head scratchers here: 1) Why is Barrett (and even Miz for that matter) being pushed to the pre-show, while Fandango and Jericho are allowed 10+ minutes later in the card, and 2) Why did Barrett lose, and then gain the strap back the next night..?

The Shield taking on Sheamus, Orton, and Show was the opener this year.  The crowd was mostly dead throughout, which didn't exactly kick the show off to a lively start.  I was glad Sheamus, Orton, and Show lost however as they have become three of the most boring superstars on the roster.  The ending was the worst part as Sheamus did a horrible job of selling Big Show's KO punch and the camera angle showed that Show barely even hit Orton!  Hope this gets better from here!

This is not to be when next up is Henry and Ryback.  There is one of these every year which diminshes my hopes of WM promoting better quality wrestling matches in the future.  As bad as the match actually was, the ending is even worse.  Henry wins by FALLING on top of Ryback and pinning him (in the ropes!).  But then Ryback magically gets up and gives Henry a shell shock with ease..  Not a botched ending, just unoriginality at its finest.

The crowd finally wakes up slightly when the tag titles are on the line featuring Kane, Daniel Bryan, Dolph Ziggler, and Big E Langston.  Any match with either Bryan of Ziggler is always at least decent, and this was.  I think everyone knew that Dolph and Langston were gonna lose to Ziggler could cash in after the World Title match.

I'm gonna limit my comments on the Jericho/Fandango match to asking: I wonder what Antonio Cesaro was thinking as he sat in the back watching THIS?

The World Title match finally gets bumped from the opening contest, but for some reason probably should have been this year.  This average, slow, boring, title match tops out at about 10 minutes too long.  It ends and Del Rio is standing over Swagger still holding the belt.  It would make perfect sense for Ziggler to come out and cash in for the belt at Wrestlemania, but that doesn't happen despite 80,000 strong chanting his name.  WWE would rather wait to do it on Raw the next night (but hey, at least he finally did it).

Undertaker and Punk are up next, and the match is easily the best match of the night so far.  There are a few weak spots including CM Punk injuring his knee when his dive off the top rope onto the announce table doesn't give, and when some faulty camera angles show a weak urn shot to Taker and a view of Punk's head coming nowhere near the canvas during a tombstone.  But this match DOES finally feel like a Wrestlemania match, and is definitely one of Punk's better performances in my opinion.  RIP Paul Bearer.

The biggest disappointment on the night was the No Holds Barred match between Brock Lesnar and HHH with an added stipulation of Triple H's career on the line (huh?).  This was probably the only match that I was looking forward to on the night, and it was just average.  The two didn't seem to show the intensity that they did during their Summerslam 2012 match.  There are a couple good steel steps moments and some suspense with the komora(sp?) lock from Lesnar, but this mostly falls kind of flat and ends before it really gets started.  It is worth a look, but could have been so much more.  Jim Ross should have been on hand.

...Wait a minute, wasn't there supposed to be an 8-person tag match?  I guess not.

Cena vs Rock was the main event.  I think everyone knew what the outcome of this was going to be, but John Cena honestly deserved to win.  The match itself was pretty uneventful until the end when the two started exchanging finishers and mocking each other's signature moves.  They can each kick out of the rock bottom and the AA, but an AA finally ends the match?  WWE should have at least ended the broadcast with Rocky sitting on the ramp while Cena walks off with the strap.

Overall this Wrestlemania was boring and predictable.  It's sad to say that one of my favorite moments on the night was when the Hall of Fame inductees came onto stage toward the end of the show; and Mick Foley FINALLY gets his place in the hall.  Anyway, WWE didn't really give this show much potential and it showed as this is probably among the worst WMs to date.",1365552000,3,4641,4.41696113074205
5578135,2,B00BCMT2CC,"This was the first WrestleMania where I was able to predict every single thing that would happen.

  The Miz vs Wade Barrett (IC Title) prestige match:
This was probably only a preshow match because they only wanted Cena to be the only one winning a title at WM. That just shows how everything is about John Cena these days. Anyway the Miz won with the figure four.
  And I'd like to add that if we're paying $50 for a ppv, the preshow match should be on the ppv channel like it used to be. It's inconvenient to have to go to youtube or wwe.com when you should be able to just see it on your tv!

  Sheamus, Big Show and Randy Orton vs the SHIELD: Show was mad that Orton tagged himself in, so when Orton was being pinned after a spear, Big Show just let the pin happen. Then he knocked out Orton and Sheamus after the match.

  Mark Henry vs Ryback: I knew since HHH, Alberto, Undertaker and Cena would all win that one face maineventer had to lose. So naturally they'd choose Ryback because every time they can make a new face that isn't Cena they either turn him heel like Punk or job them. Think of the last match Ryback won at a ppv.
  Anyway Henry won when he held on to the ropes and fell on Ryback when he went for his finisher.

 Bryan and Kane vs Ziggler and Big E.: All I remember is Bryan getting the pin on Ziggler after a diving headbutt.

 Jericho vs Fandango: Fandango won of course after a roll-up. Everyone knew Jericho would be losing to Fandango in his first match. It sucks but it happened. Some predicted would steal the show but the match wasn't too memorable.

  Jack Swagger vs Alberto Del Rio (World Championship): Swagger was arrested recently so you knew the WWE wouldn't reward him with the belt. Alberto won with the armbar. Ziggler should have cashed in at least but the WWE couldn't let him steal the thunder from played out Cena's so called redemption. So his deserving title win happened for free on Raw when I'd pay $50 to see a Ziggler title win over the painful Cena title win.

  CM Punk vs Undertaker: Cena I predict will have the belt more than Ric Flair and end Undertaker's streak at next year's WM. Or he'll lose to Taker, say 2014 was a bad year for him due to losing one match fair and beat Taker at the 2015 WM lol.
  Punk put up a good fight but this match was hardly given the time that Taker' s last couple of matches at WM were given. End came when Taker won with the Hell's Gate.

  Brock Lesnar vs HHH in a Anything Goes Match: Was more like HHH, HBK and a sledgehammer vs Lesnar. So when HHH evened the score after SummerSlam, I was hardly impressed at all. Lesnar lost to a pedigree on the steel steps after a sledgehammer shot to the head. Really ? Having Lesnar lose to a finisher on the steel steps yet again ?

  Cena vs the Rock (WWE Title), Twice in a Lifetime match: Cena who never loses or puts anyone over and had the title more than better legends, WWE wants us to think deserved to win the Rumble and get yet another title win. We're supposed to think 2012 was a bad year for him after losing to the Rock. When he beat Lesnar with 2 moves, got rid of People Power and won MITB. So this whole redemption thing you'll only believe if you're a little kid.
  Proof that HBK and Bret Hart are much better than Cena is that in long matches they never hit the same move over and over and over again. Which is what we got from Cena in this match and pretty much every match. So what makes him deserve to have the belt more than Bret or HBK ?
  The match was way too predictable that Cena would win this time and the super Cena stuff was overdone more than ever when he kicked out of 3 Rock Bottoms! The Rock actually should have won since it took the Rock 3 WM matches to beat Stone Cold and it should have took Cena that many times to be able to beat the Rock, as long as the match didn't happen 3 years in a row!
  Anyway Cena won after an AA on the Rock for I think like the 3rd time. Then we got the usual salutes and ""the champ is here"" crap....the end. I predict a long reign where Cena makes new stars with potential like Ryback look weak.",1365552000,3,4103,4.148101265822785
5578136,1,B00BCMT2CC,"This was the most predictable and boring WrestleManias ever, everyone knew that no talent John Cena was going to beat The Rock to get redemption for his loss last year, everyone knew Triple H would beat Lesnar to get redemption for SummerSlam, and we all knew that Undertaker would beat Punk (Even though that's fine because their match was amazing.)

1st match: The Shield vs Randy Orton, Sheamus and Big Show. This was a good opening match, better then last year's opener. I'd say it's about 5/10
2nd match: RyBack vs Mark Henry. This one was really slow and boring, the only interesting part was when RyBack shellshocked Henry AFTER the match. 3/10
3rd match: Team Hell No vs Zigg E Langston. This was a good match, we got to see Langston in the ring and he was pretty impressive but this was the shortest match on the card which is sad because Ziggler and Bryan are MUCH better wrestlers then the man who walked out of the arena as WWE Champ. 6/10
4th match: Fandango vs Chris Jericho. This was a decent match, Fandango is a better wrestler then I expected him to be but Jericho deserves more then jobbing to debuting talent. 5/10
5th match: Alberto Del Rio vs Jack Swagger. This was a boring and short match. This match made the WHC look like a joke. Swagger taps quickly and Zeb Coulter's promo before this match was more memorable then the match itself 2/10
6th match: Undertaker vs CM Punk. YES, this is what a WrestleMania match should be!!! Punk hitng Taker with Muay Thai strikes then Taker hits Punk with a big boot, Punk getting thrown into the barricade and ring post, getting hit with a leg drop from Undertaker then countering Undertaker's Old School and hitting Taker with Old School himself, Punk doing his high knee and an elbow drop, Taker counters the GTS into a chokeslam was awesome, Punk kicked out of a Tombstone and plenty of other highlights 10/10
7th match: Triple H vs Brock Lesnar. This wasn't a good followup to Punk and Taker, for No Holds Barred this match was really boring, we only had like 1 or two chair shots and Lesnar going through an announce table which is something that doesn't get you DQed anyways, only interesting part was the end with Triple H getting slammed onto the ring steps, everything else was boring 3/10
8th match: Rock vs Cena, without a doubt much worse then Rock vs Cena at Mania 28, Cena kicking out of 3 Rock Bottoms, Two People's Elbows and a spine buster within 10 minutes was just awful, if Cena had talent I wouldn't have a problem with him kicking out of so many finishers, but Cena is a no talent punk. Cena wins despite the crowd booing the crap outta him and they do the cheesy ending of Rock putting over Cena, worst main event in Wrestlemania history 1/10

DO NOT BUY THIS EVENT, JUST WATCH UNDERTAKER VS PUNK ON YOUTUBE AND SKIP THE REST, THIS PPV WAS INEXCUSABLY BAD!!!",1365552000,8,2843,4.507751937984496

5578140,3,B00BCMT2CC,"Wrestlemania 29; it had all of the legends, huge stage,pyro, and 80,000 in the stands but I still consider this show average,not by a wrestling stand point but by a booking standpoint as well

We start off with a promo about Hurricane Sandy, which took forever. I understand the pain that the victims had to go threw but this is a wrestling show, and I just want to have fun not have to watch something that has nothing to do with the show. Next we have ANOTHER promo; it wasn't bad but this is taking forever to start.
Finally the first match starts off.

1. 6-man tag
The Shield vs. Big SHow & Sheamus & Randy Orton
Good way to start off the show, everyone got to do their thing, The Shield was booked very well. Seth Rollins and Randy Orton had a awesome spot before Randy was pinned. Big Show gets mad because his partners avoided tagging him most of the time; so he WMDs Sheamus and Randy Orton. Okay I have no problem with Big Show being heel because it is WAAAAAY better watching him cry all the time but everyone including the 5 year olds saw it coming; the match ended be nothing important. It would of been memorable if Randy Orton joined the Shield but NOOOOOOO, they rather have him be a stale face anyways moving ob

2. Ryback vs. Mark Henry
Boring match because of the booking. Who decided to have Mark Henry destroy Ryback for most of the match and then when Ryback started coming back and put Mark Henry on his shoulders for the shell shock, Mark Henry falls on him and 1-2-3. Not a big fan of Ryback but this was his 7th ppv lost in a row; for a new superstar....that's not good, but the booking had a plan up their sleeve; Ryback comes back to the ring and shell shocks Mark Henry. What did this match do for them ? Nothing

3. WWE tag Team Championship match
Team Hell No vs. Dolph Ziggler & Big E Langston
I enjoyed this match, the crowd was into and these four were giving it their all. I thought it was a awesome idea to do act like they were going to do the kiss of death finish at 18 seconds again. It's a CENSORED shame that these guys didn't get more time; this match would've been a lot better. I didn't have a problem with Ziggler losing at the time because I thought bigger things were to come.

4. Chris Jericho vs. Fandangoo
Fun match here. both of their entrances made the match seem a lot more important. Chris Jericho did beat Fandango a little too much and didn't get to see much offense from him but he did get the win clean and the moves he did were impressive.

P. Diddy concert: It sucked, I do not understand why they have musicians perform, no one is paying to see P. Diddy, they're paying for wrestling and Hornswoggle. He also said Wrestlemania started at '95........Sean it started in '85

6. World Heavyweight Championship match
Jack Swagger vs. World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio
I was pumped for this match, the promo was cool and I knew these guys can wrestle a good match. But we missed Swagger's unique entrance, because of P. Diddy's concert. The match was a good match, both of them were doing their job very well but after 9 mins. Swagger taps out to ADR..........WHAT THE CENSORED!! This is a world title match, and the ending was nothing memorable but wait Ziggler has the brief case, it makes sense for him to cash it in at Wrestlemania.............. Okay CENSORED WWE. Match started out great but wow ADR retaining the belt in 9 mins. is going to be remembered for years to come....... I hope you get the joke

6. The Undertaker vs. CM PUNK
Spectacular match, best match of the night, this is the only match on the card that I had no problems with, everything was wrestlemania worthy. The Undertaker proved he could still wrestle a single's match with no stipulation. This match helped the show so much. You really missed something if you didn't see this

7. No hold's barred match; if Triple H loses, his career is over
Tripe H vs. Brock Lesner
When I first saw this match, I thought it was alright but thinking about now maybe the reason why I got bored of this match was because of the crowd was no where to be found. There was some awesome spots, Brock Lesner looked like a wacko during the match and it was great. Triple H won; not a surprise but it was still a good match, the crowd made it look bad when there was no action going on.

8. WWE Championship match
John Cena vs. WWE Champion The Rock
WHAT A BORING MATCH!!! John Cena suckering The Rock towards the ending was good but everything else forgettable. Cena wins fair and square..... AGAIN!! They took a perfect Wrestlemania moment that they could of had and threw it away like yesturday's paper. Instead they hugged and kissed a little and the crowd did do something that I like and that as boo both of these bums. There nothing memorable about this match, last year's was soooo much better.

We have one more match though, it's the 8 person tag match, I have no idea why it's the main event, but there was a lot of things that did not make sinse so whatever let's watch it..........oh. These 8 employes worked for a year to get on wrestlemania and when they were told they were going to take a spot at wrestlemania and even promoted it, they took it off the card. What a slap to the face of these 8 employes and all of their fans. Maybe they shouldn't have a had a concert, or 3 promos for the Rock and Cena who were already getting 24 mins. and a trailer for a movie that they are not even making.

This show is average, nothing more nothing less. Booking hurt the show, not taking risks with heel turns hurt the show, concerts hurt the show, unmemorable title matches hurt the show, matches going no where hurt the show, false promotion hurt the show. Cm Punk vs. The Undertaker and Brock Lesner and Triple H and a solid undercard helped but most of it will be forgotten in a few years.

5578142,2,B00BCMT2CC,"The Miz VS IC Champion Wade Barrett: A short match with Miz winning in the end via figure 4 leg lock. I had Miz & I guess Barrett's WWE career is pretty much over.

The Sheild VS Orton, Sheamus, & Big Show: With all the talks of Orton going heel, Big Show turns on the team after the match. This was a good match for what is was but not as good as there previous PPV matches.

Mark Henry VS Ryback: Henry going over was a surprise but it'll keep the feud going for another few months. I don't see why they wouldnt give Ryback the win since he'll probably be one of WWE's top stars for the next few years.

Team Hell No VS Ziggler & Langston (with AJ Lee): Another surprise with Team Hell No retaining the belts in a good but short match. Everyone thought this meant Ziggler would cash in his Money in the Bank contract tonight but that didn't happen.

Fandango VS Chris Jericho: Another man wrestling his first match in WWE on there biggest stage. This match was alright & the ending was well done.

Alberto Del Rio VS Jack Swagger: They had a decent match with Del Rio retaining the title in the end. I guess if Swagger wasn't pulled over for a D.U.I then he would have been the new champion. I really don't care for Del Rio but WWE will shove him down fans throats until everyone loves him.

Undertaker VS CM Punk: The match of the night but that isn't saying much. Taker looked heavier but still managed to put on a good match. I'm sure this will be on different WWE sets in the years to come.

Triple H VS Brock Lesnar: Another surprise win as H defeats Lesnar in a wild but confusing match.

Rock VS Cena: We all knew who was going to win this match. With all the other surprise wins at the event I had my doubts. It was a very good match but I hope this feud is over.

Overall, a few surprise wins but only two matches were worth watching again. WWE is in trouble even though money is flowing the product they put out sucks. The best wrestler on the roster US Champion Antonio Cesaro didn't even have a match & the 8-man tag match was scrapped due to time. I use to miss the Rock but now I wish he would just go away. I'm sick of seeing wrestlers coming back whenever they want it reminds of me of WCW in there dying days. The only reason I'd purchase this event is because of the Hall of Fame ceremony. The Punk-Undertaker & Cena-Rock 2 will be on WWE dvd sets for years to come.",1365379200,3,2386,4.136069114470843
5578143,5,B00BCMT2CC,I watched this PPV last night and i paid enough money to purchase it. The Undertaker vs Cm punk was a great match especially both entrances were off the chain. HHH and Brock were cool and so was the Rock vs Cena II. Even the shield won in which i knew that was going to happen. Punk is added to list of legends that Undertaker has defeated over the years of 20-0 and now the streak reads 21-0. I can't wait to own on May 14 and relive the history again and again.,1365379200,3,463,3.989247311827957

5578145,5,B00BCMT2CC,"The 6 man tag team match between The Shield(Dean Ambrose,Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns) against the team of Randy Orton,Sheamus & The Big Show was a hard-hitting back-and-forth bout for a six man tag at least. The Mark Henry-Ryback match was a basic power vs power battle with no real surprises. The Tag Team title match between Team Hell No(Kane & Daniel Bryan) against the team of Dolph Ziggler & Big E Langston was pretty good,power-driven and surprisingly nail-biting. The Chris Jericho-Fandango match was not great but pretty solid. The Worlds title match between Alberto Del Rio & Jack Swagger had great storytelling but so-so wrestling. The Undertaker-CM Punk match was a emotional & suspenseful fight. The No Holds Barred match between Brock Lensar & Triple H was a physical,smash-mouth & personal brawl. The WWE title match between The Rock & John Cena was a entertaining,back-and-forth,nail-biting,heart-pounding battle of the titans. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1365292800,3,973,5.1257861635220126
5578146,3,B00BCMT2CC,"3 championships are on the line, personal grudges needing to be settled and many other storylines converge in MetLife Stadium, where the fans will witness WWE's flagship PPV ""Wrestlemania"", the true showcase of the immortals.

-6-Man Tag Match, Sheamus, Randy Orton & Big Show vs. The Shield: Well this is a bit of a shock to open the show, the Shield looked overwhelmed by the size of the crowd as they make their entrance. This is a pretty good tag match, Orton's team does some good double teaming then the Shield's pack mentality takes over as they wear down each guy. Show makes the tag to Sheamus who works on all 3 Shield members, it becomes a free for all near the end. Orton hits a midair RKO on Rollins, takes a spear from Reigns and gets covered by Ambrose for the win. 6/10, the post match sees Show hit the Knockout punch on both Sheamus and Orton and he leaves the ring.

-Mark Henry vs. Ryback: This is a definite power vs. power match and the crowd is booing Ryback big time, they size each other up hitting clotheslines and Henry hits a big slam. Then some  bear hugs that sucks the life out of the crowd, Mark just dominates for a while. Ryback goes for the Shell Shock but Henry grabs the ropes and falls on him, then covers and wins. 5/10. Henry comes back to the ring but gets the Shell Shock much to the fans shock.

-WWE Tag Team Championship Match, Dolph Ziggler & Big E. Langston w/AJ Lee vs. Team Hell No (Champions): Dolph kisses AJ (mocking what happened to Daniel Bryan last year at WM), Bryan attacks Ziggler but Big E. comes in to face off with Kane and Langston hits an impressive triple backbreaker. Kane takes over on Ziggler, and takes a throat chop from the top, even hits the Zig Zag but he gets the chokeslam and Bryan hits the diving headbutt and covers Dolph to win. 6/10.

-Fandango vs. Chris Jericho: This one had the least amount of build-up as this was Fandango's debut match, Chris hits some good tackles and some hard punches to start out, even the Codebreaker but Fandango falls out of the ring. Fandango hits a nice kick stopping Chris' springboard dropkick, later he hits the leg drop from the top but only for two. Jericho dodges another leg drop, goes for the Walls but gets rolled up for three. 4/10.

-Next we have a live performance by P. Diddy, performing his songs ""Victory"", ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" and other songs. And to think U.S. Champion Antonio Cesaro was left off the card for this.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match, Jack Swagger w/Zeb Coulter vs. Alberto Del Rio (Champion) w/Ricardo: Swagger and Coulter didn't even get a proper entrance as they are already in the ring when we come back from the video package. There's some good wrestling by both guys, the crowd seems pretty flat honestly, Alberto goes for the Cross Arm Breaker but Swagger locks on the Partiot Act. Once again the Partiot Act is on, they reverse submission holds, later Coulter puts Jack's foot on the rope to avoid a pin. Zeb interferes and Del Rio is sent into the barricade but back in the ring the Cross Arm Breaker is on and Swagger taps out. 6/10.

-CM Punk vs. The Undertaker: The passing of Paul Bearer lended some much needed emotion to the build-up of this match, Living Colour performs Punk's ""Cult of Personality"" song live and Punk gets a huge reaction from the crowd. The Undertaker does his usual long, long entrance, to a big reaction, Punk attacks early but gets beaten up and thrown into the time keepers area. The crowd is split between both guys with dueling chants, Punk counters Old School then does one of his own to a big pop. Punk hits a big double axe handle to the outside, later Taker goes for the dive but gets stopped and Punk hits a diving clothesline for two.

Punk goes for the GTS but gets the chokeslam however he kicks out at 2, then he puts Taker on the Spanish Announce Table and hits the diving elbow but the table didn't break. Taker tries for Hells Gate, Punk locks on the Anaconda Vice, Taker sits up, breaks the move hits the Tombstone but only two. The ref gets knocked down, Heyman passes the urn to Punk and he hits Taker with it but just two. After some reversals Taker hits the second Tombstone of the match and covers to win. 9/10.

-No Holds Barred Match, If Triple H Loses He Must Retire, Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman vs. Triple H w/Shawn Michaels: After having his arm broken at Summerslam and Vince McMahon suffering an injury that lead to hip replacement surgery, we have this match where everything was on the line. It was physical from the opening bell, on the outside Brock hits a suplex drilling Trips through the announc table. Lesnar takes over working on Trips, hitting a nice throw, then a German Suplex throw but just for two.

Trips does come back hitting Brock with a chair, later Shawn gets the F-5, Trips hits the Pedigree but just two, then an F-5 from Brock to Trips just for two. Lesnar uses the steel steps then throws them into the ring, later he locks on the Kimura Lock, but Trips fights out of it. After running into the ring post, Trips uses a steel chair on Brock's arm to damage it, then locks on his own Kimura Lock. Paul comes in but gets Sweet Chin Music and Lesnar slams Trips on the stairs a couple of times, for the third time the Kimura Lock is on, then a DDT into the ring steps. Trips hits the Pedigree onto the steel steps and covers to win. 9/10.

-We have some highlights of the Hall of Fame ceremony with inductees Mick Foley, Trish Stratus, Bruno Sammartino, Booker T, Bob Backlund and celebrity inductee Donald Trump.

-WWE Championship Match, John Cena vs. The Rock (Champion): Well so much for last year's ""Once In A Lifetime"" match, as we have this contest where it was all about Cena's quest for redemption for his loss at last year's Wrestlemania. It starts out much the same as last year with some one upping, then the crowd boos whenever Cena has the advantage, though there are some boos for Rock as well. There's some rest holds which sucks the energy out of the crowd for a bit, there's the usual series of moves from Cena which continue to get boos.

Rock goes for the People's Elbow but gets locked into the STF, Cena misses the leg drop, they hit dueling shots with boos and cheers respectively. A Rock Bottom leads to just two, Rock attempts a Five Knuckle Shuffle but gets the AA just for two, Cena even hits a Rock Bottom of his own for two. After suckering Rock in, Cena still gets hit with a Rock Bottom for two, there's dueling Rock Bottom/AA attempts then a snap DDT by Rock. There's a sudden AA by Cena and he covers to win the title. 7/10.

Given how low expectations were for this event a few of the matches weren't too bad, too bad the Cena/Rock finish was beyond predictable. Punk/Taker and Triple H/Lesnar were actually very hard hitting and quite good, the rest of the undercard was okay to decent. This isn't too bad of a Wrestlemania, I'd say about middle of the pack in the rankings.",1365292800,8,6945,4.453186467348544
5578147,5,B00BCMT2CC,"First off, let me say I totally agree with the person that has the title Wait a minute, I also think the person that stated that wrestlemania has gone back to the first one and is a dissapointment to WWE has lost a few screws.  What he should really look at is Raw and smackdown, talk about going back to WWE superstars era in the 90's.  I mean cmon all you see on these shows now days are complete no names that are a huge embarassment to every superstar in this years wrestlemania, and Im not talking about the pre show.  If you haven't noticed the new direction WWR is going is letting the kids have there kid friendly product on Raw and smackdown, and leave the PPV's to the hardcore fans.  All I can say is, Sunday April 7th, HISTORY WILL BE MADE AGAIN, back to the glory days of wrestlemanina, and the WWE.  As for the people that wrote megative reviews go watch amd praise Raw amd Smackdown with the Elementry kids, and wath the WWE gp down the toilet even more, What you guys fail to realize is if it wasn't for the person that is writing the current PPV's 2012-2014 There would be no more WWE.  To all the true fans out there Cant wait to whatch and own Wrestemania 29, Long live the WWE, and professional wrestling.",1365120000,,1225,4.258620689655173
5578148,5,B00BCMT2CC,"Okay guys, we got a stacked card for this one, but we also have some stars that won't make the PPV.  This is supposed to be the BIGGEST event of the year...and rightfully it seems that way in the main events.  We are going to see Faaaaaa Daaaan Goooooo debut finally against Chris Jericho, and let me tell you, Jericho would not face Fandango at Wrestlemania if he didn't think they could have a showstealer.  With all the experience of Jericho and the hunger of Fandango, this could be the sleeper match of the event.

In the six man tag with Sheamus, Big Show, and Randy Orton vs The Shield, this is a chance for the Shield to really REALLY shine.  They have had excellent matches on Raws, and at TLC.  The 3 Vets vs The Young Lions.  All I can say is, that this should be good.  I also firmly believe a certain star is going to make a statement that will have an outcome on this match.

Brock Lesnar vs Triple H...NO HOLDS BARRED - Career on the Line....all I can say bout this one that it should be just like HHH/Taker ""End of an Era""....Its going to be a brutal war.

Cena vs Rock - WWE Title:  Should be hopefully better than last years match, but I see Cena pulling out the victory in this one.

The one I am waiting for The Streak: Undertaker vs CM Punk.  Now we all know that Punk and Taker will tear the house down.  Punk will be driving Taker as Punk will probably take a HUGE beating.  The way they ended Raw was a statement in itself.  Punk pouring the ""ashes"" all over the Deadman,  Taker even saying he doesn't care about winning as he said, ""I'm gonna hurt you...AND I'M GONNA HURT YOU BAD!""  This is the one....As much as I know it still could be the other way,  I see Punk ending the streak once and for all.  This match, Punk can earn that respect he's been chasing all these years.  Beating Undertaker would put Punk in a class all on his own, which he so rightly deserves.",1364947200,2,1893,4.2027777777777775
5578149,5,B00BCMT2CC,I am so excited for this years wrestlemania because I am one of the biggest WWE fans that I know and I think this year everything will change cena will win the title for an 11th time CM Punk will beat the undertaker I could go either way on that much but I love the build up to it,1363824000,,280,3.76271186440678

8566054,4,B00BCMT2CC,"Wow. And a Happy Birthday to Me!

Lent was over and I was done fasting and ready to get something to eat and watch one of my favorite springtime events. Had a nice little birthday breakfast in bed as well as my presents. I went to church, confessed and got blessed by the Monsignor. Enjoyed the leftovers from an excellent Italian dinner and Strawberry Cream Cheese pie. And I saw the WrestleMania XXIX Pay-Per-View at a Party at my friend's house. Pizza, soda and cookies I was so glad Lent was over! A great show then I went back home to get ready for school. All in all a wonderful birthday!

The event was as spectacular as I've come to expect. Love WrestleMania's soundtrack. Coming Home Skylar Grey and Diddy is a nice song. The first match was the Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs The Miz. I think a lot of people can agree that Wade Barrett is on his way, but the Miz has lately become a really cool presence in regards to his hard work and his association with a lot of legends like Ric Flair. I enjoyed this match and the result. Hoorah!

Shield vs Big Show, Randy Orton and Seamus was interesting. Despite beginning as villains, Shield eventually became hard core anti-heroes and despite going against veteran World Champions they brought the house down with their performance.

Mark Henry vs Ryback was forgettable but given Mark Henry's previous World Titles, he tried to do his best to make him look good but not during the match.

Hell No vs Big E and Dolph Ziggler was okay but it goes to show that Kane and Daniel Bryan were a perfect Odd Couple team.

Fandango vs Chris Jericho was something I expected for Chris Jericho to put one over on a newbie.

Alberto Del Rio vs Jack Swagger was interesting but a but stereotypical Face vs Heel match.

Undertaker vs CM Punk was a great match. Heyman and Punk both played the jackass card on the Undertaker and this played as a great tribute to the late Bill Moody aka Paul Bearer. The match was great and Undertaker made a great match, earning a well deserved notch in his epic win-loss WrestleMania record.

Triple H vs Brock Lesnar. Another great match. The fact that these men fought like it was a title match surprised me. Hunter has nothing but the greatest love for the business and while I respect Brock when he can bring it, he doesn't bring it as often. He's still that wet-eared meathead out of OVW sometimes, but not here.

John Cena vs the Rock was also pretty good at least it didn't end in a fiasco. Some good work here and there and I can respect John Cena, the Rock didn't do as strong, showing his ring rust from his time in Hollywood. Still a good end.

Nice bits here and there. Love this Blu-Ray collection which includes the WWE Hall of Fame Ceremony, with all the great champions and celebrities, one in particular a future US President.",1518220800,,2828,4.482490272373541
