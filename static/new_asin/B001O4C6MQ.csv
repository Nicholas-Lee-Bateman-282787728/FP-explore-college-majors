3728020,4,B001O4C6MQ,"This is a fun series with a semi-retired policeman who is still beholding to his department head to take on special assignments, while trying to open and run a restaurant - his avocation.  The mix is a witty blending of crime with a lot of local color, marital give and take, british bureaucratic bungling, and food.  Fortunately you don't have to sample the cooking though the locals love the steak and kidney pie he is serving up at his ""Pie in the Sky"" restaurant.  You'll love the ingenious crimes, the way his wife gets involved in each situation, and his totally unique manner in crime-solving.  British humor at its best.  We are waiting for Series 2 to be released.",1244332800,3,673,4.621848739495798
3728021,5,B001O4C6MQ,"Starring:
Richard Griffiths as D.I. Henry Crabbe
Maggie Steed as his wife & restaurant owner Margaret Crabbe
Malcom Sinclair as ACC Freddy Fisher, Henry Crabb's superior who keeps him working for the force.
Joe Duttine as Steve Turner
Bella Enahoro as WRC/DS Sophisa Cambridge, the beautiful woman Henry hates to see (she brings the cases to him).
Nick Lamont as Chef Gary Palmer, a reformed ex-con.
Ashley Russel as John the waiter
Alison McKenna as Linda the waitress

The first year of PIE IN THE SKY dealt more with setting up the restaurant & introducing the characters; the police detective work was back story until about the third or forth episode.  It took me several episodes to get into the series but I stayed with it because I liked the actors & the characters they portrayed.

The company description fails to mention the real reason Detective Inspector Henry Crabbe continues working part time for the police: Blackmail.  Henry was tricked into appearing to take a bribe, even though he is entirely innocent, this circumstance enables his superior, A.C.C. Fisher, to blackmail Crabbe into continuing to take on occasional cases as required, threatening to re-open the inquiry if Crabbe disagrees.

A blackmailing Police force is the real story behind this series.  So there is quite a bit of tension between D.I. Crabbe & his superior.  And D.I. Crabb is willing to do anything that makes his superior look bad.

While the Full Frame DVD (the show's original framing) has no Closed Captions, the episodes do have Sub-Titles (accessible from your remote).  I prefer subtitles over Closed Captions as they do not mask over the picture. With British accents, I tend to leave the subtitles on.

Disc 1 has the first 4 episodes.
Disc 2 has the next 3 episodes & brief background information.
Disc 3 has the final 3 episodes & a 15 minute interview with Maggie Steed.

A Richard Griffiths interview is sadly missing from this set.",1241568000,10,1939,4.89908256880734
3728022,5,B001O4C6MQ,"Although the box description touts the comedy aspect of this series, it is 98% police mystery. There is some lighthearted moments, and some images of fine food (no recipes provided), but expect some serious investigative work by a crime detective that sometimes has his own way to looking into the facts, sometimes not quite on the up-and-up, and always with his heart back at the restaurant called ""Pie in the Sky.""

Many kudos for the performance of Inspector Henry Crabbe (Richard Griffiths) as he unravels the sometimes nonexistent clues. He also cronically seeks time to work on new menu items and cares for his music loving chickens (eggs must be fresh). Crabbe's wife, Margaret (Maggie Steed), plays the perfect spouse, looking out for the financial side of Crabbe's retirement cafe as well as keeping him honest with his requirements to his police boss, Fisher.

Assistant Crime Commissioner Fisher (Malcolm Sinclair), is a man provided for the viewer to hate. He traps Crabbe into abandoning his retirement plans, after an investigation arrest goes bad, and Crabbe gets a minor bullet-in-the-leg wound while dining with the man supposed to be arrested. It looks suspicious. Fisher all but blackmails Crabbe into additional crime assistance, always at Fisher's beck-and-call, forcing the retirement ""Pie in the Sky"" restaurant to be started up under Margaret Crabbe's name. She doesn't even like food.

Each episode is a new call to a different crime and tough investigation that ACC Fisher needs help solving. Promotion seeking Fisher plans on Crabbe taking the blame if things go awry.  For all viewers that enjoy English versions of police mystery, this is unusual and quite well done.  Acorn Media has provided SDH subtitles for every episode, sometimes a help with the fast-talking, strongly accented, members of the cast.

Episodes (10 at 49 min. each) included in this first Series 1 set are:
1  The Best of Both Worlds-  Crabbe gets shot, retirement delayed opener.
2  The Truth Will Out-  Restaurant begins, along with police corruption.
3  An Innocent Man-  Many food regulars, but one needs investigated.
4  Once a Copper-  Seafood menu time, & a dead man returns.
5  A Shot in the Dark-  Red herring and smuggling make a mixed menu.
6  Undesirable Elements-  Crabbe public relations assignment finds crime.
7  Passion Fruit Fool- Fisher vacations,Crabbe stirs in restaurant crime.
8  A Matter of Taste- Wine menu, and Margaret gets involved with crime.
9  Who Only Stand and Wait- Farm fresh veg's, mix with buried body parts.
10 Endangered Species- Crabbe gets set up, must he arrest Margaret?

The 3-DVD set includes a Bonus Feature interview with Maggie Steed in widescreen. the episodes are in full screen.  Enough crime and mystery suspense to keep you waiting for the ""Pie in the Sky Series 2"" coming later.

3728040,5,B001O4C6MQ,"This series has a charm that grows on you. The hero so to speak conducts himself in a calm and gentle way that is the characteristic of a wise man. He reminds me a little of how Maigret was played by Michael Gambon in contrast to fussy and somewhat angry types like Inspector Morse played by John Thaw. His wife is perhaps the secret of his inner contentment as she is a strong woman who can stand on her own, but seems to love her husband and is supportive of him as he launches a restaurant while yet a detective. And like many today he has his own chicken coop in the backyard of the restaurant where he withdraws in time of need.",1478217600,4,633,4.154471544715447

Self centered, totally critical of anything her husband tries, full of herself on every instance - especially when she totally screws things up - and generally a very stupid and unsupportive character. A suck up to everyone except her husband, she isn't even funny like Lucy in I Love Lucy, and she is always, always, always wrong and a screw up. Such a sad character.

3728069,3,B001O4C6MQ,"I like many British series, especially having to do with the cozy mystery genre. This series showed promise, for the most part. However, in this viewer's opinion, there was just a tad too much of the personal message woven into some of the story lines. Emotionalism does not fare well with me. Give me a good little mystery with some humor, some drama and leave out the ever present message about saving everything. Also Richard Griffiths' character was weak. He comes across like someone who has lost all their fire and is now just coasting, allowing most others to push him around, use him, intimidate him. He has forgotten how to be assertive and just say 'no'. Is anyone really this easy going consistently? Well, one might be but all those around us don't make it probable to remain so passive on a continuing basis. I gave it 3 stars for the story line and I liked his wife. She is more in charge of everything than he.",1379635200,,925,4.511904761904762

3728084,3,B001O4C6MQ,"This series is a nice idea, but, for us, not nearly enough intellectual material, even for an entertaining evening.

I recognized the main character from other series and when Michael Kitchen was included in the first episode, I figured this might be a sleeper -- and it is!

3728087,5,B001O4C6MQ,"Love this detective, he is different and everythig he does centers around food and what he eats, but he solves his cases with panache.",1322179200,,134,4.625
3728088,5,B001O4C6MQ,"What a charming series. What I enjoy most about it is that, while it's highly entertaining, not every episode involves a gory murder which requires a team of CSI experts to solve. Most stories truly are just mysteries, which are solved by the ever-observant and astute Inspector Crabbe.

In preparation for Detective Inspector Crabbe's retirement, Margaret and Henry Crabbe sell their house and purchase a restaurant, Pie in the Sky, over which they now live. Dramatic circumstances arise in which Crabbe's official retirement is postponed, and he must now be at the beck and call of Assistant Chief Constable Freddy Fisher, an ambitious, self-serving administrator, to solve crimes as Fisher summons him. Fisher usually uses Crabbe's sleuthing skills to further his own hidden agenda; however (thankfully), you can't put one past Crabbe. The unfolding of the story and the development of the characters (Fisher included) are an absolute delight to watch. Also lending their own respective charms are the English countryside and the fabulous food!

Crabbe's sardonic putdowns of Fisher (watch why he names his rooster after him), dry wit, passion for the art of cooking, and the restaurant setting lend loads of charm to the series, and the Crabbes' affection for their staff and the people in their lives completely won me over.

The series appeals to the foodie in me and is definitely a television cozy. I highly recommend and look forward to Season 2!!",1317168000,,1456,5.135021097046414
3728089,5,B001O4C6MQ,"An under-rated and truly wonderful series. Initially, the gastonomic story line with it's tubby ""detective chef"" sounded a tad contrived. Happily, the characters & their singular narratives will grow on you if they're given a chance. In the end, the superb Richard Griffiths (in a marvelously sly & understated performance), his charming wife (Maggie Stead), & their eclectic (if evolving) ensemble cast DO become like family. The mysteries are suspenseful but focus on ""puzzles"" & dastardly schemes rather than grisly murders.

PIE IN THE SKY is perfect for the entire family & dissatisfied viewers who would prefer a mix of ""All Creatures Great & Small"" & ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" (with a pinch of ""Two Fat Ladies""), rather than in-your-face action & gore. The sole negative--& it's a huge one--is that this idiosyncratic series didn't go on forever.

Warning: If you're looking for serial killers, carnage shoot outs, obscenities, graphic sex/nudity, PC Agendas--or hard edged & attention deficited throughout, this IS NOT the series for you.

""Pie In The Sky"" is genial, perplexing, & subtly wise.",1314489600,3,1100,5.238636363636363
3728090,5,B001O4C6MQ,"Pie in the Sky is quintessentially British with the whit and dialogue on the quick and whitty side - some would say witty repartee.  An enjoyable mystery to be solved, an eccentric detective who also happens to own a restaurant, his independent yet loving wife and his intelligent, insightful police constable.  It is a recipe for thoroughly enjoyable evenings spent in front of the TV.  While others might prefer the blood and guts and yelling and knocking, I prefer the subtle yet masterful and powerful unmasking of the criminal as well as the interplay between the players.",1314230400,,577,4.927835051546392

3728092,4,B001O4C6MQ,"The customary fine character acting of the British mysteries combined with gentle humor makes for pleasing though not gripping 50 minute shows. I found them to be enjoyable watching and, for the average American, I suppose, they are quite understandable listening. I use both headphones and the captions but could make out most of the words without the  latter.
The Amazon description pretty well tells the story. The first episode establishes a, by-now, ancient TV situation, innocent man set-up for a crime he did not commit who is forced to take on cases of crime-solving for the police when called upon. In this case, the innocent man is the police officer who is allowed to run his newly purchased restaurant so long as he is ""available"" when needed. He is not permitted to retire as he wishes because of this usefulness. The lead, police officer and premiere chef, is quite well played as is his wife and the female constable assigned to help him with the special cases brought to him. Others in the cast include a number of piquant types which add  strength to the show. The plot lines are familiar but effective as the clothesline upon which the characters can do their turn. Not, I should think, a challenge to Poirot, Marple, Frost, Morse, Lovejoy and the other strong series but a good lead-in to the more substantial fare of your evening's entertainment schedule. DVD's from succeeding years allow those who are well and truly hooked, to indulge themselves for quite a bit more time.",1304035200,,1495,4.813229571984436

3728104,5,B001O4C6MQ,"As long time fans of British mystery and drama we are always on the lookout for something new. During the looking process we found this series and decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did because we have really enjoyed these first adventures of Detective/Chef Henry Crabbe as played by Richard Griffiths.

Our only previous encounter with Mr. Griffiths was as Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter Movies. This brief exposure in no way does justice to this remarkable actor who has made a name for himself as an actor in stage, screen, and TV and has won numerous acting awards.

All of his rich background is brought to bear as he portrays a veteran policeman who is wearying of his job and is longing to devote himself to his real love, cooking.

This first series carries him from the crucial turning point in his career as a policeman to his dual role in life as a policeman/chef and does so in a fast paced, good humored manner.

This is a series suitable for the entire family, and combines Crabbe's experience and intuitive insights as a detective with his love for food, well prepared and presented. We always are interested in new views of the English countryside and get plenty of them with this series.",1297296000,2,1211,4.566820276497696
3728105,3,B001O4C6MQ,"As someone who generally likes British mystery series, I thought this one looked promising.

After seeing and mildly enjoying the first season (the characters do grow on you), I have to wonder if the people writing the editorial reviews actually ever watch any of the episodes. There is no comedy in this series - there IS occasional mild humor, usually connected with some of the quirks of the main characters or a wry plot twist.  But don't buy this if you are looking for laughs.

The premise of the series starts to wear thin - the main character wants to retire and run his restaurant, but due to some bungling of a big case (mostly other people's rather than his own), his boss puts him on a never-ending leave of absence during which he tries to run his restaurant while constantly being blackmailed into working on cases for his boss.  I haven't decided whether to watch any of the later series, but I sure hope they get him out of limbo.  The whole blackmail thing gets stretched way too far.

The mysteries themselves are entertaining enough, with a twist or two to keep things interesting.  I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and if you like a light mystery where everything and everyone turns out well in the end, then ""Pie in the Sky"" might be worth a look.",1295654400,5,1277,4.550218340611353

The budget is low, the moving transportation scenes are obvious padding, the wit is very slight, and the major character, fat enough to sink a ship, is unconvincing as a policeman.  Perhaps foodies would enjoy this series more than anyone else.

3728110,4,B001O4C6MQ,"This UK series features a detective who is also a chef.  His restaurant is called PIE IN THE SKY. He is married but his wife is a lot more interested in accounting than in fine cuisine.  I would have never guessed in a million years that this lead actor is the same one who plays Harry Potter's Uncle Vernon.  In this series, he is so easy to like whereas in the Harry Potter films, he is so easy to hate.  That is quite an acting range.  He is a very low key, soft spoken detective.  He immerses himself in his crimes and gradually takes over the whole ball of wax from whomever else is involved in the case.  His superior officer is a total idiot, solely interested in furthering his own career in police administration.  He makes Jack Frost's Mullet look like a cop's cop in charge of the detectives by contrast.

I can only go 4 stars on this one.  The problem is that the UK has so many excellent crime series that after awhile you start sorting them into the 4 star and 5 star ones.  There is no such thing as a 3 or less star one.  I like the edgier ones, the detectives who have a lot of vices and or problems in their lives, such as those played by David Jason (Frost), Jeremy Brett (Sherlock), Robson Green (psychologist Tony Hill), Robbie Coltrane (Cracker), Helen Mirren (Jane), and Clive Owen (Tanner).  This series reminds me more of the Inspector Morse series, which was very well done but I never could warm up to Morse, much less his sidekick Lewis.  Yet Morse was also at least a 4 star series. Likewise the Lynley-Havers series came in at only 4 stars but this time because there was such deviation from the books, not because I didn't warm up to the actors.

This crime series has a perfectly well adjusted detective in a loving marriage who goes about solving his mysteries in a very quiet, low key way while also juggling a restaurant.  I enjoy him but I miss the angst and the vices.

3728111,5,B001O4C6MQ,I bought this feeling that I was taking a chance and when we watched Pie in the Sky we were hooked.  It has a good story line and several sub plots in each episode.  We enjoy the characters and the way that they interact.,1265155200,3,221,4.0
3728112,5,B001O4C6MQ,"These episodes combine a pleasant light mystery, some light humor, quirky well written characters and excellent acting.  I can't wait until the other seasons are available in US format.",1264982400,,185,5.379310344827586
3728113,5,B001O4C6MQ,"Pie in the Sky is another one of a string of brilliantly produced British Drama/comedies. British televison prides itself on using ""real"" characters. In Pie in the Sky the lead actor (Richard Grifiths) must 300 lbs. if he's an ounce. The cast is not male & female models with perfect teeth and 1% total body fat - these people you can see and meet on almost any English street. The story has Agatha Christie type drama and twists and the odd bit of off-the-wall humor - ideal for anyone who is sick and tired of the over produced, slick Hollywood productions with their liberal sprinkling of gratuitous violence.",1260576000,4,612,4.675925925925926
3728124,5,B001O4C6MQ,"What a delightful show!  It boasts the type of fine acting and writing that British shows like Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, etc., are known for. How Inspector Crabbe manages to solve the case (while playing departmental politics) is fascinating but I really think the added bonus of the culinary angle is what makes this show special.

Best of all, are the well rounded (excuse the pun!) characters who we come to know and like so much. I particularly liked Margaret, the independent yet supportive wife and John, the waiter par excellance!

This is a great series if you like intelligent cop shows, warm-hearted comedies, culinary mysteries, Britain ... or just plain good television!

The second series is due out in January 2010. There were 5 ""seasons"" altogether.",1257379200,3,769,5.031496062992126

At last it is out in the US format, and she watched most of the series in one night! She loves it - comedy and detective show in one, and a large amount of Britishness thrown in for good measure.",1254528000,2,298,3.9833333333333334
3728126,5,B001O4C6MQ,"The package I bought as a gift arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion. I had seen the disc previously and found it amusing, different, and well-acted. The combination of detection and food was a winning one.",1254355200,,218,4.615384615384615
3728127,5,B001O4C6MQ,"I just came to this drama and find it outstanding!  Griffiths is excellent as the low key fairly calm and controlled detective/master chef in a small English city.  Each episode is well crafted and gives everyone a chance to develope thier characters.  The first episode, which sets the stage is outstanding between his trials with ""the job"" and interviewing chefs for his new restaurant.

You have to be quick to catch some of the lines which set the plot elements.  Crabbe's discussion with his one time class mate and now boss, Fisher about what it takes to advance in the force is great!

All the characters, from Crabbe's wife, his co-workers in the police force and the restuarant are exceptiional.  Then again, this is a British production so why would they not be?  The plots twist and turn but that is what makes this series so enjoyable.

At times I get Crabbe a little confused with Sergeant Cribb, another outstanding crime drama detective although set about 100 years apart.

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in British crime dramas.  You with thoroughly enjoy it.

I am anxiously awaiting season 2.  Roll on January!",1252800000,5,1140,4.814432989690721
3728128,5,B001O4C6MQ,This series so much fun to watch.  I will be watching it again and again.  It is funny and serious.  I can't wait for series 2.,1252713600,,127,3.8076923076923075
3728129,4,B001O4C6MQ,"How come the British manage to do it everytime! I mean choosing an actor that makes the character really live, breathe and interact just like a regular bloke. David Suchet as Poirot, Diana Rigg as Mrs. Emma Peel, Leo Mackern as Rumpole and now Dursley as a fat overweight, thoughtful detective whose passion lies in the kitchen!
I don't know why I even bothered to get the series; I was looking for something new, something different and the opening episode was barely enough interesting for me to go on. By the end, I said to myself, well let's give the second episode a try. And then I was hooked!
Richard Griffiths grows on you, although given his bulk, one winces when he tries to hurry. Maggie Steed is wonderful. But it is Bella
Enahono who as Sgt. Cambridge steals the show. I was actually waiting for her to show up in episode 4, just praying she would not be dropped from the series. And she did. This is one of the best of the first season.
The stories, sly and understated could be more interesting, but the characters breathe fire into half hearted plots. Wish there was more culinary scenes, perhaps a few recipes thrown in like a fruity pasta in one of the earlier episodes.
Did you know that ox kidneys are better than veal ones, in the making of that fine English dish, Steak and Kidney Pud?
More, more. I am looking forward to Series 2, and 3, let there be more!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/If-There-Wasn-t-Death-Middle_english-Edition/dp/159800915X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">If There Wasn't Death (Middle_english Edition)</a>",1249948800,7,1585,5.0534351145038165
3728130,5,B001O4C6MQ,"In Pie in the Sky, the great British character actor, Richard Griffiths, plays Henry Crabbe, a copper who's done his 25 and wants to open a restaurant.  As it turns out he's forced to continue policing, but he does get to open his restaurant, Pie in the Sky.  PitS is referred to as 'your cafe' by his unctuous superior, who has blackmailed him into continuing on the force, working on special projects, i.e. projects which would be of benefit to the superior in his career.  Things don't exactly work out that way, as Henry is able to be true to himself and to his diners.  This is an interesting concept--appealing to both foodies and mystery buffs--and it works.  It works because of Griffiths, but a strong supporting cast and a series of interesting scripts helps.  This is light entertainment with an occasional serious moment.  Best of all, the original episodes are approximately 48 minutes in length, so that you can watch 1, 2 or more at a time, depending on your mood.  There's no hour-and-forty-minute commitment at the get-go.  Watch for Michael Kitchen as the baddie in the opening episode.",1249516800,,1104,4.768421052631579
3728131,2,B001O4C6MQ,"As a lover of all things mystery and most things British, I'd hoped this series would be a winner. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it for me. While I enjoyed the characters and set up there are just too many misses in the mystery department. I think it's because far too many times the detective acts so out of character for one in the police. I know, I know, he's 'out' of the department, but that makes it worse. It's not unorthodox methods, it's reacting in a way that no real detective would consider.

I wish I could see season 2 to see if they 'fixed' this problem as I enjoy so many British mysteries such as Rosemary and Thyme, Midsomer Murders, Poriot, etc. Pie in the Sky would have a lot going for it...if it would just take ITSELF a bit more series where the mysteries are concerned.",1248739200,10,797,4.348993288590604

3728133,5,B001O4C6MQ,"""Pie in the Sky Series 1,"" a British mystery television series that happily mixes cooking and crime, has been seen only in spotty syndication on public television stations on this side of the pond. The show, made by the British Broadcasting Corporation, is a comedy/crime/drama that debuted on BBC1 in the United Kingdom in March 1994 and ran for five series.  It now comes to us as a 3 volume boxed DVD set, comprising ten episodes that run approximately 488 minutes, plus an 18-minute bonus program.  And, among the usual bonuses, subtitles: bless you, Acorn Media.

The show stars Richard Griffiths (a Tony-winner on Broadway for ""The History Boys,"" also the film of the same name,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-Boys/dp/B000NIVJFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History Boys</a>; he's also featured in the Harry Potter films); and make no mistake about it, along with his everyman looks, the man can act. I saw him in ""The History Boys"" on Broadway, and his performance certainly rated that Tony.  He plays Detective Inspector Henry Crabbe, an intelligent, sensible, mild-mannered man, who, after 25 years on the force, has lost his hunger for what the job can provide, and is ready to pack it in and open his own restaurant, ""Pie in the Sky.""  But the police force isn't ready to let him go.  So he bounces back and forth, cooking delectable steak and kidney pies, and solving crimes.  ""The Times [U.K.]"" describes the show as ""as much a pleasure for culinary enthusiasts as it is for crime fans,"" and, by Jove, I think they've got it.

Griffiths receives solid support from Maggie Steed (""Shine on Harvest Moon""), as Margaret, his accountant wife, who's not all that pleased at suddenly finding herself a restaurateur.  The rest of the company, led by Malcolm Sinclair (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000MRA5NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>) as ACC Freddy Fisher, with whom Crabbe trained, and worked; and Bella Enahoro as the particularly lovely D.S. Sophia Cambridge, also turn in excellent performances. There are also some distinguished guest stars: Michael Kitchen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>); Andy Serkis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy </a>); Pete Postlethwaite (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Name-of-the-Father/dp/0783227906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Name of the Father</a>), and Julian Fellowes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000SK5ZKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen: The Complete Collection</a>), among others.  The BBC hasn't stinted on extras; streets and cop shops bustle as they should.  Nor has the BBC stinted on location filming: the fictional restaurant ""Pie in the Sky,"" was located on the Old Town High Street in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in premises that were then a florist, but have since become a restaurant called ""Pie in the Sky.""

The episodes are: ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" ""The Truth Will Out,"" ""An Innocent Man,"" ""Once a Copper,"" ""A Shot in the Dark,"" ""Undesirable Elements"" ""Passion Fruit Fool,"" ""A Matter of Taste,"" ""Who Only Stand and Wait,"" and ""Endangered Species."" The mysteries are, by and large, ingenious and original, and the cooking tips are helpful.  We've been missing something tasty over here.",1245283200,,3801,6.488142292490118
