4066493,4,B003498RRM,"This is two stories in one, and it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Bobby he is the boyfriend and Green Card wanna be holder to Lynn Collins who plays Kate. The film starts with them on Brooklyn Bridge in New York where they toss a coin and on seeing which side it is they both run off in opposite directions. Then as if by magic they both appear at the other end to meet the other one where the stories diverge and we get two alternate tales- one is `yellow' and one is `green', but not sure what the significance was except the yellow version has a yellow cab in it (?)!

Incidentally this is not two different perspectives on the same story, but two completely different stories. One finds them picking up a stray dog, then going round to her moms where they face up to family and life issues, loss and a bad case of thespianisis. The other sees them finding a lost mobile phone in the back of the cab and then getting into a load of high octane adventures with a hit man or two who want it back.

Of the two the action story is the more gripping and so it was strange to juxtapose that with a story of family frailty and relationship issues. Had the latter been more explosive like a take from Tennessee Williams play for example then it would have been a better foil for the duelling of the two tales. As it is more subtle it sort of keeps letting the film go slightly off the boil. Then it is back to the action etc. And it is all full on again

All of the acting is fine but even Gordon-Levitt (playing a Canadian who does not say `aboot' - as if) can not breathe enough life into his character in places, and we all know he is a top rate actor and probably chose to do this as he likes supporting indie films, much to his credit. It is not a bad film though and is actually one of those that keeps you hooked right to the end. However not everyone will be satisfied with the end and for the pedants out there you will not miss a slightly obvious plot hole, but that aside this is still a well directed and filmed effort, hence the rating, but it is only just four stars as I am being generous as I had a great night out last night and am probably still a bit squiffy- if in doubt just go for a rental.",1340409600,2,2206,4.090069284064665
4066494,3,B003498RRM,"same two characters two different stories , to me it made no sense. Even Q.T.'s pulp fiction made more sense when it wasn't in context.  Maybe some of us aren't ready for those kind of movies yet.",1331769600,,196,4.297297297297297
4066495,5,B003498RRM,"Uncertainty, Movie. Received in as new condition. I never buy new anymore when I can buy thes barely used movies for less than half price. I watch their ratings with lots of sales and go by that, no surprises yet.",1324080000,,213,4.35
4066496,3,B003498RRM,"The course of our lives is determined by the countless decisions - both major and minor - we make on a daily basis.  So much so that one simple and seemingly insignificant act of choice can set the course for our entire future, including where we`ll go to school, who we`ll wind up marrying, whether we`ll be killed crossing that street or live another fifty years because we took a different route entirely.  That is the theme explored in ""Uncertainty,"" a dual-level drama produced, written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel.

The movie opens with a young couple - played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins - standing on the Brooklyn Bridge, obviously on the brink of making some major decision regarding their future.  After a coin flip, one heads in one direction (to Manhattan) and one in the other (to Brooklyn), leading the couple to have distinctly different experiences in what might be thought of as parallel universes.  In the Manhattan-based scenario, Bobby and Kate, dressed in yellow, are plunged into a bizarre cloak-and-dagger tale set off by the finding of a cell phone in the back of a cab (a bit like ""24"" if it were made on an indie-film budget);  the other direction leads to a more mundane domestic drama wherein the lovers, dressed in green, celebrate the 4th of July with Kate's family, including the overly critical mother who drives the young woman crazy with her negativity and interference.

The different-paths-equals-different-outcomes theme has been explored before, most notably in 1998's ""Sliding Doors,"" but here the why and the wherefore of it all seems to have eluded the filmmakers - as it does us.  Each storyline is interesting enough in its own right - and the acting and direction are first-rate throughout - but they fail to come together in any kind of a meaningful way.  They literally run along parallel tracks, with no point of convergence from which we can deduce a point - unless it's that bright yellow is probably not the best fashion choice when you're trying to outrun a hit man.

Moreover, the movie doesn't lay down the ground rules for the scenario in a very coherent or consistent fashion.  The synopsis for the film says that the couple uses the coin flip to determine how they're going to spend that holiday weekend.  Yet, it's obviously much more complicated than that, for in one version, Kate is pregnant, but in the other she isn`t (or, at least, it`s never mentioned).  In one, she is the star of a Broadway play; in the other, she says she works at a restaurant.  And the two couples obviously live in different parts of town.  Perhaps, consistency really is the hobgoblin of little minds and we should be looking at the larger picture here, but, all the same, the movie leaves us with a lot of unanswered questons, which may not necessarily be a bad thing, but it can make for a frustrating experience at times.

I recommend watching ""Uncertainty"" for the risks it takes and the mood it sets (Peter Nashel's evocative score is very helpful in that regard) but, when it comes right down to it, the movie seems a commendable but over-elaborate effort at stating the obvious.",1296000000,,3155,4.761467889908257
4066497,2,B003498RRM,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has acted in some excellent independent features.  This isn't one of them.  He is always riveting to watch on screen, and his portrayal of Bobby is no different.  The film doesn't work well because of the enigmatic structure of split concurrent realities.  In one, Bobby finds a phone.  In the other, Bobby finds a dog named Tiger.  There's a parallel, but to what point?  Lynn Collins does a nice job as Bobby's girlfriend, pregnant in one reality.  This part of the film, labeled the ""Green"" storyline, was more interesting as a family drama.  Nelson Landrieu as Uncle Felix does a splendid job.  His strong performance lends great sympathy to those who suffer from Alzheimer's.  Assumpta Serna also does a nice job as the mother who can't convince her younger daughter to take advantage of a scholarship.  The ""Yellow"" storyline has a more exciting plot including an Asian guy chasing the couple and shooting at them.  But ultimately, the phone like the storyline seems discarded.

As directors, the film has good pacing and intercuts well between ""Green"" and ""Yellow"" realities.  But as screenwriters, the film seemed as splintered as the concept.  ""Why?  What's the point?"" were questions that went through my mind.  While there were some strong film performances for which I'm glad I've seen the film, the structure of the story makes this a DVD that I will not add to my personal collection of rainy day films.

4066498,3,B003498RRM,"JGL usually plays edgy roles and he plays those VERY well. Therefore I picked the movie and I am not disappointed in his performance or that of his partner in this movie. It's a nice slow Sunday night movie - if you are into NYC on a sunny day and if you like edgy movies. I totally liked the music / sound - very spacee.

If you like French movies, you might like this one too. Tons of feelings - good and sad, a mixture of Momento and Run-Lola-Run. EDGY.",1287273600,3,456,4.066666666666666
4066499,1,B003498RRM,"I always appreciate inventive filmmaking but sometimes things just don't work out. The script was written without dialogue. The actors developed all the dialogue with the directors during rehearsals. Now that is not something you can say about most films. And it fits with the whole theme of the film. But sadly it just does not work here. I am a huge fan of JGL but his character (and everyone else's) is just plain out flat. And don't even ask me what was going on with both plots. This is another interesting idea though.  Have two plots going on at the same time. Showing how one choice can change everything. Too bad its nothing worth watching. When I said don't ask me about the plot, it wasn't that it was over my head it was just boring and I kind of stopped paying attention.

They had good intentions with this film it just failed to really amount to much. Still I applaud the cast and crew for trying something different.",1284336000,2,932,4.476470588235294

4066501,2,B003498RRM,"Positives:
(1.) The concept of two people (partners) somehow separating their lives by flipping a coin to decide which of two directions they go and then to again meet but with the other's (partner) parallel self and then see what happens is interesting in a far fetched sort of way.
(2.) Great acting by the main characters helped pulled it off more than so than the story otherwise would have been.
(3.) Yellow and green identifiers to sort out the parallel lives was fun and useful.

Negatives:
(1.) Confusing beginning especially the running and with no setup explanation to guide the viewer as to what's taking place it made the viewing more of a ""Huh""? experience until you sort it out.
(2.) Failed to utilize the rescued dog angle to complete that half of the story. Maybe should have had the dog save the lives of the other parallel halves story. The dysfunctional family life was shallow in one half and the gangster story as a counterpoint was good idea but was a poorly constructed in the other half.
(3) Would have been a more finished/complete story to somehow interact the two parallel halves at the end for some sort of explanation or closure.

Neutral: If you're confused at this point don't worry you'll see.",1278028800,9,1225,4.693023255813953

8388293,2,B003498RRM,"Very different type of movie.  You have two different plot lines going on at the same time and you switch back and forth at the director's whim.  Both are the same couple Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins.  The plot line in Brooklyn is a drama and the plot line in Manhattan is a thriller.  You start with the two running off a bridge, one in each direction evidently at the decision of the flip of a coin -- why?  Never explained.  The two different stories - why?  Never explained.  When the film ends nothing is tied out - why?  Never explained.  If not for the interesting premise and the excellent acting I would have given this a one star.

8388300,3,B003498RRM,"3.5 stars. This was a four-star film until the ending, which, for me, did not fulfill the promise of the rest of the film. A young couple finds themselves unable to make what is obviously an important decision, so he tosses a coin, and the film goes off in two different directions, each representing a different result of the coin toss. One direction lands them by chance in a very dangerous situation, while the other lands them in the middle of family issues. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has made some very interesting choices on the independent film path, and Uncertainty can be added to that list. Both leads, especially Gordon-Levitt, are so good that we are drawn into both scenarios with equal interest, wondering all the while how the two scenarios will either merge or at least intersect. The disappointment comes in the fact that the scenarios do neither; the film ends with both scenarios continuing on their on their own path - ""we just go on from here."" Yes, there is uncertainty in any decision we make and there is no way of knowing where the path will lead. However, desire the title, uncertainty as an ending to this film was rather flat and left me unsatisfied. Definitely worth a look, however, especially for those who like independent films.",1342224000,,1256,4.76605504587156
