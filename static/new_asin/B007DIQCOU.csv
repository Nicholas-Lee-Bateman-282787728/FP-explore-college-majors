8514975,3,B007DIQCOU,"1937 feature is something about a bigtime radio crooner heart-throb who can't take it anymore > meets the real thing and manages to warble away from his big money backers and their vixen who must keep him focused on the bottom line. all forgettable songs...the only good one is the *written* as a bad song for the wife of the main backer. movie has a lot of novelty fun and flow...but geesh! I gotta go back and look for PERT KELTON, Jackie Gleason's first Alice! TWO STARS.

the second feature is very funny and clever, directed and co-written by the great George Marshall. NED SPARKS, new to me, is a great ""stone face"", with a bit of Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton in his personae. he's a world weary successful businessman who has the nerve to stay out late with a buddy who suggests he slip-in thru the maid's window. little does he know his spendthrift spouse has hired a maid on an impulse.

Sparks' buddy then advises him to hire a new housekeeper (that will bring her back from going home to MOther's)...not bad advice..but he, in a sleepless stupor, drifts into a matrimonial service, not a maid service. this craziness is made crazier when a couple of incompetent detectives decide to follow him around.

ELISE CAVANNA, the actress who played the rubber limbed ""patient"" to WC Fields' ""DEntist"", plays the replacement maid here > Sparks' wife once again hires someone without telling him. she arrives expecting boredom and within 5 minutes she's running hysterically from room to room! normally playing a very staid ""Librarian type"" it's fun to watch her move, and very sensually indeed!

don't want to give away the rest.....it really cooks.

look also for BABE LONDON, as one of the matrimonial hopefuls! FOUR STARS.",1417910400,2,1729,4.769230769230769
