This is like an advanced course in working with pregnant women. There is so much info here that I keep coming back to it to learn more. I feel really confident, after watching the tape, to be able to handle the pregnant women who come in for a massage.",1173657600,16,266,4.32
2732982,5,B000MGBP24,"I like the ""Real Bodywork"" series and this video is no exception. It covers everything from contraindications, detailed demonstration of positioning and draping, a massage sequence, lots of special considerations from things you can do to relieve specific symptoms to helping mom find a posture that will reduce wear and tear on her body. I found it very useful and I am much more confident about doing prenatal massage now.",1371427200,2,424,5.071428571428571
2732983,5,B000MGBP24,This instructional DVD is superb. Leslie Stager gives an excellent break down of massage for pregnancy. The instruction given is very clear and easy to follow. Extremely professional. Highly recommend it!,1340755200,3,204,5.612903225806452
2732984,5,B000MGBP24,This pregnancy massage dvd was excellent. I feel much more prepared  to give pregnancy massage now. I only wish I could get CEU credits for it!,1323648000,2,143,4.5
2732985,5,B000MGBP24,"Lots of information is given in this DVD.  I liked that you could go straight to specific conditions.  This video was a good review and did provide me with several new techniques that I can easily incorporate into my massages.  Prenatal massage was included in my basic massage class.  I haven't taken any advanced prenatal courses; thus, I found this DVD very beneficial.",1312243200,2,372,4.857142857142857
2732986,5,B000MGBP24,"I think this is a very good video.  I found it well organized and easy to follow.  If I could think of a weakness I would say it lacks chair massage modifications and I don't recall any precautions given for laying a pregnant woman on her left side.  But, overall a very good video.",1302220800,2,282,4.185185185185185
2732987,5,B000MGBP24,"Informative and very helpful. Good for those new to massage and also those that have experience but are still uncomfortable with giving pregnancy massage. Leslie supplies good information yet frequently talks for too long when you just want to see her technique. Video is broken up into multiple sections varying from positioning, techniques for specific conditions, sequences and extra information. Highly recommend this video to any therapist that would like to improve on pregnancy massage.",1298246400,,493,5.586666666666667

2732989,5,B000MGBP24,"This video covers everything it states and more, sometimes too much more.
I too have worked as a L&D nurse, and even I could only take it in short snips.
Though I do believe all massage therapist should know the information before doing a pregnancy massage.
So, find a comfortable chair, get some tea, a scones or two, and pay attention there is a lot here.",1217721600,4,357,4.424242424242424

I found this DVD very helpful.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in pregnancy massage.

Leslie Stager gives a wealth of information in a short amount of time.  Her years as a labor and delivery nurse, childbirth educator, and midwife gives her confidence and professionalism.  She demonstrates proper draping and body positioning fit for pregnancy massage.  It covers a broad spectrum of pregnancy issues and even includes a client intake form with questions geared to the pregnant woman.",1199059200,7,671,6.8352941176470585
2732991,5,B000MGBP24,"Great DVD! Lots of useful information & practical sequences for the beginner and experienced therapist.

I definitely recommend this DVD if you (qualified therapists) do not have time to attend a course or sit and read pages and pages on this subject.

Great for reviewing over & over, good confidence boost!",1181174400,11,308,5.019607843137255
8168810,5,B000MGBP24,Bought this with the book. Great investment. Wish it showed actual repositioning especially with the cushioning systems or how the pillows they use are stacked. Overall well worth the money and time!,1523491200,,199,5.25
8168811,2,B000MGBP24,"This DVD came highly recommended, however, I do not like it and could barely make it through the DVD. I find Leslie rambles and does not have a clear concise instruction. Instead its as if she is speaking off the top of her head, almost as if she was having a conversation with you, but not as if she had prepared for an instructional DVD. I find it slow and dragging, and the whole production needs more direction. I don't feel I have learned anything that I couldn't learn from YouTube. Resources like Carol Osbourne and Marie Clair Miller share the same knowledge in their YouTube instructional videos.",1476662400,2,605,4.611111111111111

8168814,4,B000MGBP24,"I like that you can watch by region and also by common side effects of pregnancy...nausea, back pain, sciatica. It is more so for those who have a general understanding of pregnancy massage, and would like a more in depth look at the procedure. I recommend if looking to add pregnancy massage to your modalities.",1430524800,,312,4.6909090909090905
8168815,3,B000MGBP24,Way way too much about massaging the belly of the mom. Most women don't like to be touched there especially when pregnant,1419206400,,121,4.545454545454546

8168819,5,B000MGBP24,"The video was very informative, a bit long in explanation of certain aspects but very helpful in preparing therapist for venue.  It was very helpful in knowing what not to do with a pregnant woman and how to position  her for the best outcome.",1376870400,,243,4.5
