1328854,5,B00003CY57,"The Wayans Brothers wrote and starred in another hilarious movie. These guys have revolutionized the parody genre with movies like Don't Be a Menace..., and now the Scary Movie series. This movie is just as funny , with parodies they didn't hit on like What Lies Beneath and parodying the Exorcist/Stigmata type movies. This will soon be considered comic brilliance along the lines of Mel Brooks.",992390400,,396,5.015151515151516

1328879,3,B00003CY57,"I've seen all the film's but the first is my favorite. The second isn't that bad, it's probably my second favorite but it's not as good as the first. The kids from the first movie are now in college. Their ordeal behind them, they sign up for a special project that requires them to spend a weekend in an old house. But it's not what it seems. The servant is crazy. Bodies pile up. I think this movie was the last good one in the series",1479859200,,436,4.0813953488372094

1329005,5,B00003CY57,A very hip and funny parody of recent horror films.  Anna Faris deserves an Oscar for her ability to act direct and outrageously entertain her audiences.  If you need a good laugh this is the place to be.  Viewer discretion is advised,1455926400,,234,4.523809523809524

The only catch is that it's references are dated to 1997-2001. That happened to be right when I was in college so I caught most of them. If you aren't into movies and pop culture or are significantly younger, a lot of the jokes song make sense.

It's also pretty inappropriate. It's not for you if you don't have a raunchy sense of humor. If you do, you're in for a laugh.

There are also websites to check if you can't quite remember the reference.",1435968000,,679,4.248062015503876

I really enjoyed the first film in the series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scary-Movie/dp/B00AYB16EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scary Movie</a>, and also enjoyed the third installment,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scary-Movie-3-5/dp/B00C9S4AHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scary Movie 3.5</a>, but this entry in the series just felt rambling and pretty pointless. It's almost as if they had some jokes left over from the first film and decided to stretch them out in a full length film.

As the film opens we get a pretty decent ""Exorcist"" rip-off with James Woods. This opening scene was the highlight of the film, and almost as soon as it's over the film travels downhill really fast. We once again meet several characters from the first film. Anna Farris reprises ""Scream"" knock-off roll again, and is joined by Marlon & Shawn Wayons, Tori Spelling and Regina Hall. A couple new characters introduced in the film are Tim Curry playing Professor Oldman and David Cross as Dwight Hartman. Unfortunately Curry and Cross are completely wasted. The sole bright spot of the film is Chris Elliott as the butler.

Traveling to Hell House, the group begins to experience paranormal activity, and we get references to ""The Changeling"" and ""The Haunting"". Unlike the first film, they references are done in passing and the humor in ""Scary Movie 2"" isn't really based on parody like the first film.

Overall it's a pretty boring, and tame movie. The jokes are pretty stale, and even the ones that work are spread so far apart, your bored and tired of waiting for the payoff. It's easy to see why the Wayans' brothers lost the series after this lackluster entry.",1377216000,,1872,5.557894736842106

1329297,2,B00003CY57,Scary Movie was interesting and mildly amusing. The use of shock humor and absurdity combined with parody bordered on entertaining. The attempt to repeat with little or no new material is simply a waste of time and effort.,1376179200,,222,4.868421052631579

1329367,3,B00003CY57,"I'm one of those people who thought (and still think) that the original `Scary Movie' is hilarious despite its stupidity.  I'd watch it any day of the week with no hesitations.  The second venture in the series is certainly better than the third (a total abomination) yet, it shows major weakness in the concept behind the spoof.  Branching out within the horror genre to encompass the supernatural, `Scary Movie 2' takes on the haunted house idea with the same gross-out approach it took on the `teen slasher film'.  The opening sequence, with regard to `The Exorcist', is above and beyond the best scene in the film.  It is just hilarious, even though it is beyond disgusting in many parts.  It just works, and sets a tone that the film doesn't always follow.  Some of the more outlandish gags fall very short, especially whenever the film shifts the focus of its humor.  When they aren't spoofing the horror movies they claim to be, they wind up coming across just plain stupid (I mean, basketball...really?), but there are still many laughs to be found here so don't be ashamed to indulge in this guilty pleasure.  I just wish certain film series knew when to call it quits.  Greed is a powerful force that degrades the integrity (if there is any to be found in a film series that pokes fun at baby wieners) of anything good, and so with each sequel the original loses some of its likability.  Again, at least this is better than the atrocious third entry.",1304035200,,1460,4.642023346303502
1329368,5,B00003CY57,"First thoughts...Holy crap! It's better than the first one. Much funnier and it has a great opening scene that makes fun of The Exorcist. Amazing job. Here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--It's again directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and I think that he improved since the first one. Very nice directing job.
2.  Script--Okay, it's funny as hell. You got to love the way they wrote this movie. Amazing job.
3.  Acting--Same as the first one. Not bad, but not great either. Anna Faris is back and you also have Tim Curry and James DeBello.

Now for the content review.
Rated R for strong sexual and gross humor, graphic language and some drug content.

1.  Sex/Nudity=7/10. Lots of sexual jokes but never any actual nudity.
2.  Violence/Gore=2/10. Not bloody at all. Some mild violence but it's played for laughs.
3.  Language=9/10. More than the first one but still not horrible. 38 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. It's better than the first one in my opinion. It's much funnier and has a better story. Recommended to fans of comedy and horror.",1292889600,,1072,4.87292817679558

1329376,3,B00003CY57,"I'll admit that I written off Scary Movie 2 when I first seen it as a sporadically funny sequel to Scary Movie(which I love). After seeing it again it's a lot better than I gave it credit for and is better than what comes after it.

Scary Movie 2 pokes fun at haunted house movies, The Exorcist and even Charlie's Angels. The movie has its fair share of laughs in the beginning of the movie but sometimes the gross out gags are way over the top. To explain why I think this movie is a mixed bag, I'll contrast the funny parts from the unfunny parts.

Funny Scene#1: The beginning with the spoof on the Exorcist was pretty funny stuff.

Unfunny scene#1: The scene with James Woods on the toilet is flat out disgusting. Bleeech! James Woods already gives me the creeps so the last thing I need to see is him on the john.

Funny Scene:# 2: Marlon's character teaching Anna Faris's character how to be hip and she mistakenly beats up on some unsuspecting girl.

Unfunny Scene# 2: Chris Elliot's abnormal hand digging into a pie as well as a turkey. Nuff said!

Funny Scene# 3: Tori Spelling's character becomes clingy to a ghost after a night of sex.

Unfunny Scene# 3: Shawn Wayan's character impaling the evil clown from Poltergeist with his third leg. Need I say more?

Funny Scene: # 4:  The spoof on the Nike commercial.

Unfunny Scene: #4: The wisecracking parrot pooping.

I could go on forever.

Scary Movie 2 is a lot better than most people give it credit for but it could have been a lot better than it predecessor. What kills it is the excessive gross out gags are focused on more than the movie that its supposed to poke fun at. All in all it was a good spoof not a great spoof. Its definitely better than Scary Movie 3 and 4.",1242172800,,1735,4.354037267080745

1329388,4,B00003CY57,"If you're a fan of crude, sophmoric humor, you'll enjoy this movie. Like the other movies in the series, this one has one main parody (in this one, it's ""The Haunting"") with several other parodies of movies thrown in. The very first scene, which is not essential to the plot, is perhaps the funniest. It's a pretty good parody of ""The Exorcist"", starring James Woods as a less-than-enthusiastic would-be exorcist. The funniest part occurs when the possessed girl's mom and her other white, upper-middle-class friends are gathered around the piano and break into a ""gangsta rap"" song. I was laughing so hard I was crying.
The rest of the movie centers on several college students who stay in the obligatory spooky old mansion to study psychic phenomena, sort of what happens in ""The Haunting"". Of course, things go awry, and pandemonium ensues. The performances are very funny, and there are some good parodies. One of the funniest scenes occurs when a marijuana plant in one guy's room turns into a giant monster, rolls up the hapless teen in his bedsheets, and starts to smoke him.

This movie in one word is fun. There are a lot of jokes from other famous horror movies in here and they are done well. The movie is silly, but it is not a movie that is supposed to be taken seriously. From the basketball ""STOMP"" scene where they dance for no reason, to the funny butler played by Chris Elliot,  the movie has a lot of randomness that is just funny. Overall this movie is really worth seeing. I think the butler is the funniest things about the movie and how everyone is trying to avoid his deformed hand.

While Scary Movie 2 has a few 'lame' shots, it actually delivers a whallop right off bat and has a good running before losing it's footing for a bit.  The opening scene sets the plot, with James Wood as a priest with a bowel problem as he has to bless the house ocupied by this possessed girl with the most histarical tongue is movie history.  I could watch that scene for 2 hours and feel satisfied.  Unable to cure her, the setting is now one year after the events in Scary Movie 1 and the surviving members of the massacre, and even some of the dead ones, are just trying to forget...and they are enrolled in a sleep depravicy study course.  The professor, in an attempt to awaken the demons of hell house, has these students, and a few new additions, spend the night in the house.  Now we get to spoofs of 'House on Haunted Hill' 'Hollow Man' 'Hannibal' 'What Lies Beneath' and many others...and it's great stuff.  Chris Elliott plays the house's keeper with a retarded hand that is the most disgusting thing, yet the funniest thing you'll ever see and the dinner scene is just histerical...While not as genuinly funny as the first, it still packs a punch, and while the scene where Marlyn gets smoked by a giant weed plant, or where they dribble a basketball like the globetrotters may be a bit 'lame' the scene where Shawn rapes a clown doll and the hilarious spoof on 'Save the Last Dance' more than make up for it.",1142812800,,1560,4.355172413793103

But a lot of the jokes here were unpleasentful and disgusting. This one like the others is a spoof off horror movies such as the exorcist and hannibal. It even mocks Charlie's Angels. I found a lot of the jokes distasteful but recommend it for a rent ONLY if you like the first one. Believe me, this one's really stupid and a lot worse than the first. The opening exorcist scene is hilarious as are a good deal more of them but I was expecting something more tasteful and a lot funnier.

1329414,5,B00003CY57,"I'm going to have to agree with most of the previous reviewers and say that this indeed is the best one of the Scary Movie Trilogy.
Scary Movie 2, following in the footsteps of its predecessor, is a parody of several films including The Haunting, The Exorcist, Hannibal, Charlie's Angels, even Hidden Dragon Crouching Tiger.
It is a funny movie, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.  The casting is very good, and the story is very well written and very well presented.
Overall, it is a film definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood! 4 Stars",1110931200,3,619,4.526785714285714

It's not always laugh-out-loud hilarious, but I admire the ballsy, shameless way they do it coz they could have just played it safe and did it the traditional tame, PG-13 way.  The first Scary Movie spoofed the Scream-era films, which were in a major need of spoofing coz they were terrible.  Part 2 tackles supernatural thrillers,more specifically The remake of The Haunting(another crappy movie in need of spoofing).  Naturally, it's all hit and miss humor, but even during it's lowest points it's entertaining enough.  It doesn't quite recapture the laughs of the first film, even though it's basically the same formula.  They were under some tremdous pressure to do the film I understand.  When it comes to crude, John Waters-esque humor, I usually find it more amusing than I do funny.  The Exorcist/Amityville Horror spoof with James Woods was really the highlight of the film, for me anyway.  You expect silliness from the Wayans Brother, but with James Woods it was so out of place and it worked well.  I especially love Woods' reaction when he first sees the posessed girl.  Not as good as the first, but worth renting.",1110153600,,1212,4.921182266009852

Basically, they take the plot of The Haunting, where they are in this haunted house, add the plot of Hollow Man, where they have to kill the ghost, and they have different film parodies like What Lies Beneath, The Polgerist, and numerous others.

The crude humor is as bawdy as it gets, pushing the envelope for an R-rated movie. The only part that truly satisfied my craving for comedy was the part where they parody that part in ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" where the two guys have tatoos on their backs that say ""Dude"" and ""Sweet.""

Now this movie had funny scenes however few if any of them were at all related to spoofing. Most of the scenes for which I lauged were just scenes encouraging pointless violence and/or stupid movie cliches and stereotypes.

A bunch of college students get taken to a haunted mansion where things get progressively wierder. Then eventually the undead start appearing and harassing the college students and stupidity ensues.

This movie has the problem that if you did not see any of the movies that they are spoofing then it is certain that you would not understand the majority of this film. Thus the film relies on other filmakers to make sense of the majority of this film. Furthermore it is unlikely that people will watch the movies that this movie is spoofing long after they leave theaters thus this movie will become obselete and dated and impossible to understand for generations to come.

Had this movie been funnier, more trashy, and less shameless then perhaps it would be worthy to watch otherwise pick up the movies on which this film is based or some movies that are funny on their own.",1092009600,,1277,4.666666666666667
1329424,3,B00003CY57,"If you're gonna get this movie, get it dead cheap, cos otherwise you'll be moaning about your loss of money. The first Scary Movie promised no sequel, and at the time of writing, the third one is already at the cinemas, so we'll soon see which is worse.
Nearly all the characters return from the first one, except those ones who were very obviously killed off. Anna Faris is gonna be known as ""that chick from the Scary Movie trilogy"", which could be something she'll live to regret - she could be known as Erica, the girl who's baby was given to Monica and Chandler in the last series of Friends. Shawn and Marlon Wayans return, as do Brenda Meeks, who's boyfriend Ray, is still as confused about his sexuality - although there was more focus on this in the first one. Thankfully! For some strange reason, they're joined by Tim Curry (no doubt the 'highlight' of his career), in a role which is neither funny, or up to his usual menacing standards. There's lot of cheap laughs at people in wheelchairs (played brilliantly by the 'balding' David Cross)
The whole film is mainly a spoof of House On Haunted Hill, just with no Catherine Zeta Jones or Owen Wilson. (Boo) Other films that have been spoofed, are Charlie's Angels, Mission: Impossible II, The Exorcist (very funny opening scene), Hannibal, Save The Last Dance and many more - how many can you spot? (There's also a character called Megan Voorhees) The Save The Last Dance spoof (where Shorty is teaching Cindy to act 'ghetto') is quite funny, as is the Exorcist spoof. Although sickening, the projectile vomiting incident is quite funny. And he tongue used in the spoof of The Exorcist is the tongue used in the original Exorcist movie. Strange but true. The film falls slightly flat after the opening scene, although the scene with the basketball, and them all acting up to the camera, is quite good.
Something extremely ridiculous that happened was the fact that Marlon Brando was originally supposed to appear as one of the priests in the opening scene (I can't quite see it somehow.) He was paid $1 million to play Father McFeely. He TOOK the money and accepted the role, but got pneumonia a few days before shooting his scenes. Therefore, he was no longer in the film. Let that be a lesson: always pay them afterwards! :)

Tori Spelling was just *awful* in this picture, and it's no wonder that the majority of her efforts ended up on the cutting room floor (you can view them as deleted scenes on the bonus disc if you feel like punishing yourself).
The talented Tim Curry is totally wasted here, as well. Another big name, James Woods, was pretty funny as the priest with bowel problems.

The dining room scene is in such bad taste that I found myself hoping Elliott would be killed off soon.  Alas!

This darling actress has in two films been beaten, kicked, stomped on, cut, etc., etc,. and she plays it with such sincerity and innocence one can't help but admire her.  She has been the best performer in both of the movies.  The second reason is the hilarious, gut-wrenchingly funny scene with Faris and the cat.

  All people who have seen The Exorcist will get a kick out of the Scary Movie scenes, but may I add that Linda Blair has already done an entire parody movie of ""The Exorcist"" when she put on the make-up one last time for the film, ""Repossessed"" (1990).
 The monster marijuana plant was a funny idea.  Tim Curry brings in his professional performance.  Richard Moll (NBC's Night Court tv series) plays the ghost.

1329450,4,B00003CY57,"I was always hesitant about watching both parts of the Scary Movie series, since most of the parody movies (and movies in general) out today aren't very much to my liking.

However, I finally decided to watch the first Scary Movie out of recommendation, which had me laughing hysterically to the point where I'd be almost out of breath, as well as literally almost choking on my drink while watching certain scenes. That should be a warning: don't eat or drink ANYTHING while watching these films.

This time around though, I'd have to agree with most of the reviewers here: this one didn't please me as much as the first one did. While the LARGELY disgusting jokes - which revolve around human copulation, bodily fluids, human waste and other such seemingly taboo subjects - are exploited to exaggerated proportions, the humor just seems a bit lackluster in comparison to the first. It could be that they tried a little TOO hard to outdo themselves this time around, or they were just less inspired for this outing. It's almost as if they covered so much territory on the first movie, that it was almost inevitable that the Wayans brothers would fall a bit short this time around. But, having said that, I still do get laughs out of this thing.

Featuring appearances by Tori Spelling, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry and Richard Moll (remember that guy from the ""Night Court"" television series?) along with most of the crew from the first outing, you'd be well advised NOT to eat or drink anything during this film. Your appetite will have a SERIOUS chance of being ruined - especially for turkey. Filth, silliness and exaggerated stupidity are the order of the day. My rating for this is more like 3.75 stars, but, if you want to watch something that'll give you a break from seriousness, my thumbs go up.

The 'original' group (+ a few unfimiliar add ons), being the survivors of the prequel's massacre, are now invited to participate in a sleep deprivation experiment taking place in a haunted castle (which is organized by their sexually thearsty professor and his disabled assistant). The castle includes a rude parrot and a butler with some problems in one of his hands, which he insists on pushing anywhere... As you can probably understand, one thing this movie isn't lacking in is handicapped jokes. If you're sensitive to this kind of humor - beware...
While the original 'Scary Movie' had its shining moments, 'Scary Movie 2' seems like a tasteless, flat movie. The only reason to watch this is to see what became of the characters (in case moive #3 would be better).",1052179200,,953,4.746987951807229

Pretty much everything in this movie is sick.
By the time the movie was over, I literally felt sick to my stomach.  Sure, a couple of scenes made me chuckle, but nothing came close to even making me laugh, since it was all so appalling.

But Scary Movie 2 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It's not the worst cuz Batman and Robin easily wins that title but this movie sure did come close.  It is definetly a bad sequel.  I don't even see why Scary movie needed a sequel and if it did, why was this junk made?  I will admit that Scary Movie 2 does have some funny moments (which is why I gave it 2 stars) but not alot.  The main problem w/ this film is the fact that alot of the movie wasn't making fun of Scary movies, some jokes were based on movies like ""Dude Where's My Car?"", ""Charlie's Angels"", and ""Hollow Man"" and there was alot of cheesy jokes such as Cindy singing a long w/ the radio and the person on the radio then saying ""Would you shut the f**k up and let me sing"".  There were also gross jokes such as the part where they made fun of Dude where's my car? where Ray and his room mate got tatoos; one's said RAY and the other's said F**KED ME!.  After that they kept saying ""Ray F**ked me""  Anyway, here is the plot.
It's has now been a while since the murders, and the gang returns with Cindy, Ray being the straight yet acting gay person, Shorty as the guy who just smokes weed, and Brenda as the annoying b**ch she is.  Joining the gang are Buddy (Christopher Matherson), Alex (Tori Spelling) and Theo (Kathleen Robertson) who is SO HOT.  The kids are in a some programm where they have to spend the knight at haunted house whose servant is Chirs Elliot w/ a strong, yet tiny and gross hand.  The whole thing is set up by Tim Curry (In what might possibly be his worst role ever) and David Cross as a guy in a wheel chair.  What nobody is that in the house, a ghost decides to terrorize them with the most cheesiest ways ever like getting it on with Alex (If you know what I mean)
So overall, this sure is a bad movie.  It does attempt to live up to the expectations of the first like doing the same thing when Buddy and Cindy were trapped in a freezer and did something that made them both feel good but had disturbing consequenses (You'll know what I mhen when or if you decide to this movie) If you do see this movie, I HIGHLY suggest you rent it first.

1329461,2,B00003CY57,"When I saw Scary Movie 2, I made the biggest mistake and didn't see a good portion of the movies that were parodied (HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, HOLLOW MAN, HANNIBAL, WHAT LIES BENEATH, THE EXORCIST etc).  I had only seen 3 of the movies, Hollow Man, Hannibal and The Exorcist.  All of which didn't seem to matter all that much considering that only small pits and pieces are used from these 3 movies.
Scary Movie 2 bases it's plot and story around the story and plot of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.  The Kids have all been invited to a mansion to stay the night and throughout that night, they are haunted by the ghost of the man who once lived there.  It's now up to the gang to survive the weekend, fund the ghost and stay clear of Hanson, the butler (Chris Elliot).
I wasn't a big fan of this one, even after I had seen all of the other movies that are required to see this movie I still wasn't impressed.  My reason for that is because the movies parodied in this one were bad movies.  Let's face it Hollow Man had outstanding special effects but a horrible plot.  House On Haunted Hill was another poorly thought out teen horror movie but parts of it did wig you out.  I won't deny the CHARLIE'S ANGELS parody made me laugh, but it wasn't nearly enough to make up for the first 90 minutes of the movie.  That and no new comedy was used.  There was a lot recycling in this movie, mainly the sexual humor.  The only new source of comedy was from Hanson the Butler (you'll see).  But even his visual comedy wasn't enough.  In fact, it's more disturbing than funny.  The bird in this movie was also pretty funny but again, not enough to hold up an entire movie.
I'd skip this one.  It's not as good as SCARY MOVIE.  Parts of it will make you laugh here and there but for the most part, it's nothing you haven't seen before.  I wouldn't even suggest seeing some of the movies that were made fun of either.  The only ones I'd suggest would be HANNIBAL, THE EXORCIST and WHAT LIES BENEATH.  My true rating on this movie is 1  stars but seeing as how I can't do that, I'll be generous and give it 2.",1041984000,,2086,4.21969696969697
1329466,3,B00003CY57,"Scary Movie 2 did not live up to all its hipe. I have 2 major complaints with this movie, keeping in mind that I loved the original. First, the length of the movie, which is a very short 74 minutes (approximately). I couldn't believe it was over so soon. When I watched the deleted scenes, most of them could have been left in the movie and most were funnier than what was in the movie. My second problem follows those lines. The movie was not all that funny. The first 15 minutes are absolutely great but it's all down hill from there. Of course there are a few more laughable scenes (espically those with the deformed hand). Most of the supposed comedy later in the movie is sexual humor but very dry at that. Overall, I would recommend you to rent Scary Movie 2 before buying it because you might be disappointed, even if you liked the original Scary Movie. If they make another one, I hope they read some of these comments.
Senseless is an alright movie.  I didn't care for it as much as Scary Movie 2 but it has its laughable parts.  Marlon Wayans plays a struggling college student working several jobs to make ends meet.  He's also trying to win an entry-level job at a Wall Street firm. In order to make a few extra bucks, he agrees to be a medical test subject and takes a drug that is supposed to amplify all of his senses. Sure enough, the results of the drug are humerous and it is played well.  Though, the writing falls short in comedy; even with David Spade as Wayans's enemy, the movie is never more than sporadically funny.",1040083200,,1540,4.355400696864112

THE MOVIE: This movie just didn't cut it. While the first film was hilariously funny and endlessly entertaining, SCARY MOVIE 2 is rarely laugh-out-loud funny and gets boring about half an hour into the movie. Even though I loved the whole premise of haunted-house movies being mocked, it feels like totally wasted potential. Most of the laughs aren't even associated with the haunted-house mockery. They're from movies like DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR and CHARLIE'S ANGELS! Am I missing something here or is the movie supposed to mock SCARY films?
THE SPECIAL FEATURES: Better than the movie, but not by much. We get a forgettable stills gallery and a fairly entertaining behind the scenes feature. There are 10 or so deleted scenes and some of them are quite funny while others are just silly.

Some of the scenes are hilarious, but there are some that are just plain mindnumbingly dull (like the wheelchair battle between the ghost and David Cross), and Shorty's pot humor is now as stale as a year old dimebag.

1329493,4,B00003CY57,"Scary Movie 2 is a step down from the original, but there's still lots of ... gags and cute facial expressions from Anna Farris to smile and laugh at. This time, characters from the original and some new faces are taken to a haunted mansion dubbed ""Hell House"" for a ""sleep disorder experiment."" Their professor has, unbeknownst to them, actually set this up as a paranormal investigation experiment.

 The entertainment value of Scary Movie 2 isn't as high as Scary Movie, but who says there needs to be comparisons? I believe I laughed just as much. The star of both Scary Movies is definitely Anna Farris. Her comedic charm is great. The Wayans brothers are here again, and both are scene stealers. Regina Hall also returns, and she's still funny. Tim Curry, Kathleen Robertson, Tori Spelling, and more add to the cast of new characters. Chris Elliot is right up there with Anna Farris for making this movie. His character as the caretaker is unforgettable and insanely hilarious. The spoofs here aren't as numerable as Scary Movie, but still work. My favorite being the Charlie's Angels spoof. The opening Exorcist spoof is also great and hilarious with James Woods, Andy Richter, and Natasha Richardson.
 The DVD is something to be proud of. With a couple of interesting featurettes on the movie and special effects, an extensive still gallery, and a load of deleted and alternate scenes which includes 3 or 4 alternate endings. The deleted scenes contains a couple of hilarious scenes with Regina Hall which I wish they didn't cut out, and explains Tori Spelling's character more. The alternate endings are awesome, but can be seen why they weren't use even though they use a formula similar to The Others and The Sixth Sense. The animated menus with the Perch (The annoying bird) are great. I do find it odd not to have the theatrical trailer.
 Scary Movie 2 may be distasteful to some, but for fans, the dvd is a treasure.",1019260800,,1930,4.786786786786787
1329494,2,B00003CY57,"""Scary Movie 2"" (2001)
Scary Movie 2 had promise. It started out very well, with a very funny Exorcist spoof and a hilarious Save the Last Dance mockery. The movie is going all too excellently until it turns from a story to a collage of scenes that are barely funny and only just raise a smile. Had Scary Movie 2 stayed like it was at the very start it could've been a great film. Unfortunately it ruins its potential very fast, running out of energy after almost 15 minutes. This movie may not be as bad as everyone says it is, but it isn't great either.
I suppose it was just a bad idea in the first place. Spoofing haunted house films doesn't give as much opportunity to raise a smile as mocking teen horrors did. Most of the jokes are either really stupid or just recycled. There is another infamous orgasm explosion that is not even in the slightest bit funny and another unstoppable girl sequence. The really stupid and gay jokes (Shorty being smoked by a plant, the ghost at the end) should've just been cut out in the first place.
I don't really understand how this took 7 people to write it. All the Wayans brothers participated in the writing and some other groups too (writers must've been attracted after the success of Scary Movie) and it doesn't have the ingenious comedy that Scary Movie or Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Juice in the Hood (mouthful!) did. The movie barely has 7 great jokes. On the good side, I really enjoyed the basketball spoof, the Exorcist opening, the Titanic sequence, the bird in the film, the Dude, Where's My Car? tattoo part and Tori Spelling make love to a ghost. In fact, the best spoofs in the film come from movies other than horror! Although these parts gave me chuckles, the script-writers need to stick to the point!
The cast of Scary Movie 2 is more widely known than the bunch of people in Scary Movie, but the acting is not superior to the first movie. Anna Faris betters her Scary Movie performance and goes out of her way to seem the stupidest once again. In my humble opinion, the girl has talent and I look forward to seeing her stretch her acting muscles in the near future. Christopher Masterton plays Anna Faris's new love interest and he entertained me. He is a good actor and I really enjoy him in this film and TV's Malcolm in the Middle.  Shawn Wayans was funnier in the first movie and he has some okay jokes in this movie too. His performance is less satisfying. Marlon Wayans really annoyed me in this film, he had a couple of good sequences and that was all. From his first high-pitched giggle I could tell Marlon wasn't going to be that funny in Scary Movie 2. Regina Hall also annoyed me a lot in the film. In the first movie her annoyingness was funny, in this movie she doesn't have enough to say or any funny material at all. I did enjoy the special guest appearances though. James Woods cracked me up as the priest, Tim Curry was average (good for this movie!) as the professor, Tori Spelling who I really don't know what the hell was doing here but still had fun, and especially Chris Elliot as the hilarious Hanson with munted hands. Elliot's performance often had me laughing out loud, rare for this film, since there isn't much funny stuff. Also look out for Kathleen Robertson and Natasha Lyonne.
In the end, Scary Movie 2 comes off as a movie that is barely average and only occasionally made me laugh. I suppose they should've just left the original Scary Movie tagline - NO SEQUELS. Please don't give us Scary Movie 3. That'd just be cruel.
MY GRADE: C

1329495,2,B00003CY57,"Apologies to the man's fans, but I guess that I just don't ""get"" Chris Elliott. In this movie, I find his scenes to be just plain gross; I did not find anything he did to be in the least bit funny. That said, the original cast (yes,including the dead ones;no one ever REALLY dies in horror movies ;<) ) is up to their usual antics. Tim Curry and Tori Spelling are the most welcome additions, even thought their most memorable moments are relegated to the deleted scenes (kudos to Ms. Spelling for really cutting loose in her bedroom scene![pun intended]). How much of the spoof you ""get"" depends on how many of the spoofed films you've seen (or at least their trailers). The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, The Shining, and a slew of stuff you'll remember from somewhere...even if you can't remember from where. And a lot of the bits ARE funny-- some gross/funny, some stupid/funny, some just lame...a lot like the first movie. What's really amazing is the deleted scenes; this is what they CUT?? The wheelchair duel (love the John Woo doves and Matrix-type stuff!), the aforementioned Tori Spelling scene, the obligatory boring exposition scene, possessions, ghost encounters...along with bits of scenes and dialogue that might have helped some of the included scenes work better. Make SURE you watch the extras before rating this DVD; people on drugs should NOT edit movies! So rent this if you don't have anything better to watch...and the rental's cheap (or free)...and you don't have to make an effort to get it.",1018915200,4,1518,4.842307692307692
1329496,4,B00003CY57,"Okay, four stars. Yes. The movie itself doesn't deserve it, but it is a kind of good DVD, with all the extra material. Plus! Anna Faris! She is just superb on this movie, and in the last one. She is the greates thing in the movie. Okay, it isn't funnier or better than the first one. Not even close. The plot from this movie just doesn't make sense, and it's not even a solid plot. It follows nothing. Unlike the first one based on the Scream plot, this one is just a whole lot of ... comedy put into it. The gags were something funny..... but no ""HAHAHAH"" kind of laughs. I'll tell you though, one of the funniest scenes the basketball scene based on the Nike commercials, sadly, they had advertised that scene in shows like Jay Leno and so on, that when we saw it in the movie.... it..... wasn't funny. Allot of the material wasn't fresh, it was just what you would expect was going to happen if you had seen the first one i.e. Ray (the Wayan brother, not the pothead one), we just know the jokes that will be made with him when he's with the other male cast members. One thing though, you will notice in the movie that there are allot of chances to make a gag, yet they don't do it. Maybe the were trying to avoid being very predictable. I guess if this movie came out first, and the first one second, the first one (wich would have come second) would have suffered the same.
  Either way, if you are just curious to see the movie cus the first one got all that hype, and it was very good, don't. If you own the first one, then you should get this one to complete the series since there are going to be more movies from the series.
  So, no, it wasn't really worth it. The ""The exorcist"" scene was hilarious! Too bad it's the first scene, and none of those actors that come out in it come back... Don't forget Anna Faris!!",1015891200,,1825,4.1908831908831905
1329497,1,B00003CY57,"Scary Movie was the sleeper hit of summer 2000, taking in 277 million dollars worldwide. Relative to its modest budget, it was the most successful major studio release of the year.
""No Mercy. No Shame. No Sequel."" That was the tag line on the movie's posters. But no production company these days is going to pass up the opportunity to cash in on this kind of success. Scary Movie 2 was apparently rushed into production before anybody had time to write a script. The resulting mess is gross, uncool, and not even close to funny. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
The first Scary Movie was not perfect by a long shot, but it had an attitude and a point of view that produced numerous laughs. It parodied successful horror movies, such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. It helped if you had seen those films, but that wasn't entirely necessary because much of what made it funny was its approach. This was a black person's point of view of slasher movies involving mostly white people. It was insightful, on target and, indeed, without mercy. It made mincemeat out of screaming cheerleaders, dumb macho guys, bad scripts and lame authority figures. The sequel is itself mincemeat -- bits and pieces of sarcasm, cruelty and scatological jokes haphazardly thrown together.
The movie starts with a spoof of The Exorcist which inexplicably uses -- or rather wastes -- the talents of James Wood and Veronica Cartwright. The opening, which is excruciatingly bad, is an indication that the writers had run out of ideas before they even hit the word processors. The Exorcist, perhaps the greatest horror movie of them all, has been satirized dozens of times already. All that was left to do was to create a sketch grosser and cruder than all the others combined. Heaping on piles of bad taste does not make something funnier. It causes that nervous laughter people use when they are squirming in their seats. The rest of the movie involves some idiotic college students and professors in a tepid, unimaginative haunted house story.
Both movies were created by the Waynans brothers -- Marlon, Shawn and Keenan Ivory. They have often demonstrated in the past how funny they can be, but here we see how bad they can be when whatever discipline they possess is ignored. The movie is like watching three standup comics getting increasingly desperate as joke after joke fails to amuse an audience.
Just as this movie was released on video, it was announced that Scary Movie 3 is to be made. No shame. No mercy. No end of sequels.",1015804800,5,2538,4.718468468468468

Then it all goes to hell and never comes back. The movie after that point is disgusting, crass, cheap, and perverse...all of which would perfectly fine if the results were funny, but they're not. There's not a single chuckle for the run of the movie. The spoofs are just excuses for gross sex jokes and bodily functions. Chris Elliot is guaranteed to make you cringe as he licks cake frosting off of his whithered hand. In another gag sequence, a handicapped fellow pulls himself up a flight of stairs with his arms.

Those parts are most notably surrounding Shawn Wayans and a clown, the butler/ cook with a deformed hand and the reguritation and bathroom sequences early on in the film.
In all, this movie exceeded my expectations. Yet considering that my expectations weren't that high, that's not saying much. But I do know one thing, the movie is funny.

The original SCARY MOVIE was stupid but fun, it had a  history line, a defined plot and defined characters, constructed basically around the SCREAM characters.
But this sequence, shot less than a year after the first one, is a disgrace. It is just stupid, bad tasted jokes all the way. I think the Wayans brothers should think seriously about the example of a bad movie that they have directed, facing it as a lesson, not taking in consideration its success at the box office.

1329515,2,B00003CY57,"""Scary Movie 2"" may well be one of the crudest, raunchiest and most vulgar comedies ever aimed at an essentially mainstream audience.  This sequel to the original box office smash has a great deal of energy but little else to recommend it.  The first film, though hardly a model of tasteful restraint, at least managed to be clever and witty from time to time.  This version is a farrago of dirty jokes revolving around disgusting bodily functions and perverse sexuality - neither of which I have a particular problem with, but the least we could demand from such an assault is that the jokes themselves be funny.  Unfortunately, most of the humor is executed in such a strained, over-the-top style that all the effort is visible right up there on the screen - the death knell for any truly effective comedy.
At its narrative core, the film is a parody of all those ""Haunting""-type movies in which some carefully selected people are gathered together in a haunted house by a sinister doctor intent on conducting some diabolical experiment.  Along the way, the filmmakers poke fun at ""What Lies Beneath,"" ""Invisible Man,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Poltergeist,"" ""Charlie's Angels"" and an assortment of other well-known flicks.
The fact that ""Scary Movie 2"" is aimed at a young teen audience should certainly give the parents of America pause.  Although this film probably doesn't visualize anything most of these youngsters haven't articulated amongst themselves already, discriminating parents should at least be aware of the graphic nature of most of the material (if they have to pare this down for network television any time soon, there will be five minutes left of the movie).
Almost inevitably - as is the case with most of these scattershot-type comedies - ""Scary Movie 2"" manages to elicit a few genuine laughs with its antics - just not enough to make the film really worth recommending.",1012780800,4,1887,4.955696202531645

James Wood does a good job of the father.
If you want a good laugh, I highly recommend ths movie!",1010188800,,520,3.961904761904762

1329539,5,B00003CY57,"They said ""no mercy no shame no sequal"" in the first installment of Scary Movie. It's a good thing they didn't keep their word. Scary Movie 2 stars Marlon & Shawn Wayons, Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Tori Spelling, Tim Curry, Chris Elliot, James Woods, and Kathleen Robertson. The cast does a good job of acting. The jokes/spoofs are more funny than in the first. I need to say that the characters that made this movie wildly hilarious were Dwight, Hanson, and Brenda. The highlight of the film is definately the Charlies Angel's spoof. They also do a good job of poking fun at some of today's popular culture. I highly recommend this must-see comedy.",1009756800,,678,4.803418803418803
1329540,5,B00003CY57,"It is by far one of the best sequels. While many people found it horrible, I loved it. I think the reason people didn't like it was because in the movie they made fun of not so popular movies such as Hollow Man,The Haunting and others and people did not see them so they can not really laugh at the parts and may get confused. It is a little confusing that Ray is back and him and Cindy are friends but if you watch the deleted scenes you will see a part where he apologoizes and stuff. Many of the characters that where in the first and are in this are just as funny if not more. It is also a surprise that Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall)is in this considering the amount of stabs she took in the Movie theater, but again if you watch the deleted scenes her and Cindy talk and she says she became very spiritual after her near death experience so that kind of ties that in. Theo (Kathleen Robinson) also is very funny in this movie just her reactions to things is funny. Tori Spelling is in this film also but not alot but she has alot of deleted scenes.  Buddy has alot of jokes that are not from any movies which are funny. Shorty also returns and is funnier that in the first. Also new to the cast is Tim Curry (Professor)if they Make a Scary Movie 3 he or David Cross(Dwight) will really have no point to be in a part 3. This one is based while they are in college like scream 2 but don't even mention any of the Screams in this one. May part 3 will also be like Scream 3 (Cindy's life after College)",1009756800,,1500,4.084745762711864

I really couldn't get into Scary Movie 2, however, one scene I thought was the funniest was the Excorcist scene and that pretty much is it.  I was hoping to see bigger and better things from the brothers that created the first one.  I must say I'm glad I rented this before I bought it.",1009670400,,394,4.144736842105263
1329542,4,B00003CY57,"I'm shocked. Know why? It's because of how poorly done Scary Movie 2 was. The original Scary Movie was da bomb, no doubt about that. It was new, the thing that teens wanted to see. The 2nd was not. Ok, so it was hilarous. I'll admit that. But, what exactly were the Wayan bros thinking? Were they trying to add more flave to Scary Movie? Cause it didn't exactly work.
They could have done without the Charlies Angel [spoof], but The beginning was good, the whole Exercist thing. And it was easy to spot which movies it all came from. I'm not gonna go off saying this was a bad movie, cause it really wasnt. Not at all. But im not gonna say it deserves 5 stars. Cause it doesnt.
 However, If your kinda of movie is a hilarous movie that makes no sense, but its still funny, this movie is for you. But if you enjoyed the first, but care that the movie should have a point, i would suggest not getting it.

These kind of movies make you think what kind of sick people think these ideas up? and it also makes you wonder how mentally healthy our society today is...this certainly isn't making it any better!

1329558,2,B00003CY57,"The surprise success of ""Scary Movie"" has prompted the original team of filmmakers to break their promise of ""no sequel"" and return to the screen one year later with ""Scary Movie 2,"" which brings back most of the original cast for another round of horror spoofing with the gratuitous use of crude humor, bodily fluids, and unabashedly raunchy style. This time, the teen horror genre is replaced by the classic horror films of yesterday and today, as well as a few other films thrown in for good measure (if the first one could spoof ""The Matrix,"" what's to stop the sequel from playing on ""Charlie's Angels,"" right?).
I find it hard to categorize the movie as anything more than a gross disappointment, a movie that had the chance to be just as good as its predecessor, yet ends up falling flat on its face when it comes time to deliver real laughs. Guest appearances by recognizable actors prove to be little more than embarrassments for those involved, while the returning cast seems to have lost all sense of what made the first movie such a riot.
Again, we are given a cookie-cutter plot, jumbled together from the various classic and traditional horror movies devoid of teenage casts. Our surviving (and resurrected) characters from ""Scary Movie"" are now in college, with some new additions including Tori Spelling as a pig-tail-sporting twit and Kathleen Robertson as a busty bimbo with style to match. When offered a chance to spend a night in Hell House, in which a famed ghost by the name of Hugh Kane cheated on his wife, they readily accept, only to find, once again, that something is out to get them.
The movie begins interesting enough to spark some attention; the spoof of ""The Exorcist"" in the beginning moments manages to provoke some laughs, especially from James Woods as the priest sent to exorcise the young girl, Megan. The movie's minute amount of comical moments are interspersed throughout the movie, in such characters as a talking parrot and Tim Curry, who plays a combination of Liam Neeson's David Marrow from ""The Haunting, and Geoffrey Rush's Steven Price from ""House on Haunted Hill.""
As for the rest of the material filling in the voids, it virtually goes nowhere. It was easy to laugh at these characters in the first film because the teen horror genre is so incredibly overrun with clich and ridicule from audiences; here, the writers seem so determined to do themselves one better by spoofing as much as they can, that the movie quickly loses track of what it's trying to make fun of, and ends up making fun of itself.
Of course, there are the plays on dialogue from other movies (""Titanic's"" goodbye dialogue is shamelessly exploited here), and a spoof of ""Charlie's Angels"" that does nothing for the film. Spelling spends the entire movie acting like an idiot in the most unappealing way, while Robertson as the rest of the cast are constantly looking as if they don't believe in any of the material's comedic potential. The movie feels rushed and thrown together, without any attention to the films and culture it so desperately tries to parody.",1009152000,8,3084,4.798872180451128

Plot: More horror spoofs by the brothers Wayans.

DVD Special Features:
Plenty of special features for you on this movie.  No matter what features you like you can find it on this disk.  There is some really good stuff in the deleted scenes.
The Good: If you liked the first one you will enjoy the sequel.  The Wayans family does what they do best and roll out the politically incorrect jokes.
The high point of this movie is Chris Elliot as a twisted Mr. Handy.  The scenes he is in are totally brutal.  The exchanges between him and the wheel chair guy are in total bad taste.
Another good cameo was done by James Woods as a priest in the opening scene.  Woods is really funny and looks good as priest
The Bad: This movie feels like left-overs from the first film. All the good jokes made Scary movie; all the b-list stuff was put into this flick.  The majority of the cast is the same and the so are the jokes.  Unfortunately much of this movie is stale.
Torri Spelling is in this movie.  Thank god most of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.  You see a lot of Tori in the deleted scenes.
Bottom Line: If you loved Scary Movie you will like Scary Movie II

I Hate Going To The Movies, Unless There's Something Out Im Dying To See. (E.G American Pie 2/Rush Hour 2/The Mummy Returns). The First Viewing Dont Really Make Much Sense, But The Second Viewing You Really Get It All. I'm, For One, Am Not That Interested In The Haunting (Catherine Zeta-Jones), House on Haunted Hill (Taye Diggs), or Dude, Where's My Car? (Sean W. Scott). But The Spoofs Were Hilarious. Especially The Hollow Man (Kevin Bacon) Spoofs. I Really Enjoyed Watching The Scenes With The Hell House Caretaker Hanson (Chris Elliott) as Well as The Scenes With The Handicapped Dwight. The Opening Sequence Was Absolutely Hilarious. But If You Only Watched It Once, Take Another Look On DVD, You Won't Be Disappointed.

1329564,1,B00003CY57,"The most scary part of this movie is the seemingly lack of self-criticism. Maybe director Wayans should have asked himself the question: ""Do the world really need another, ""comic"" movie to lower standards everywhere?"". But alas he did not.
The only remotely funny part of the movie is the introduction, where a parody on the famous ""Exorcist"" scene is made. From that it is all down hill. The jokes and humor all seem to revolve around sex or breasts, and they all fall flat.
The plot is something about the lead character being invited to some spooky old house, where some other people have been invited too, and from there the fun picks up. Oh joy! I had hoped that the original movie had kept it promise when it said: No Sequel! But alas. Let us all pray we won't see a Scary Movie 3",1007942400,,786,4.427586206896552

The only decent scene is right at the start where the always reliable James Woods plays the role of a priest in an exorcist spoof. Apart from that scene the rest of the film sucks!

The first scene featuring their re-make of the Exorcist had me laughing so hard as well as everyone else in the cinema. The undertaker is also a funny character with his disfigured arm which adds many scenes of laughter.
Sure, the plot is kinda weird but it's very funny and mocks those films we love including ""Hannibal, Charlie's Angels, House on Haunted Hill and Mission Impossible 2"". The scene where Cindy and her new love interest are trapped in a walk-in freezer (Hollow Man) mocks that tear-jerking scene in Titanic (where Leo and Kate are freezing in the water) and made me laugh very hard.

While some moments are truly funny, the Exorcist rip-off mainly along with Chris Elliot's scenes, it still falls short of a funny film.  I did find myself laughing at times, but however my conclusion is that this is a very weak film that is just trying to cash in on the blockbuster original.  I sat there most of the time thinking about how bored I was.  Some of the jokes and scenes intended to be hilarious weren't even funny in my opinion.
Some of those characters who supposedly died in the original were back in the sequel with no explantion of how they managed to live.  Most of the scenes in this movie are downright tasteless and nasty.  But then again, so were those in the first.  And I admit, I liked the first.  And I liked Scary Movie 2 -- perhaps to a certain extent, but it's still a very weak film.

The rest goes down hill. There are some rather big laughs, but they get fewer and farhter between to the point where there aren't any. Most of the original cast returns. Didn't Regina Hall die in the first one?. Why was she here?. Once again, Marlan Wayans was as annoying as ever. He wasn't needed. Shawn Wayans' running gay joke was funny, but not as hysterical as the first. What was missing was Cheri Oteri. She was deeply needed. Tim Curry and David Cross were good, but were nothing compared to the hilarious insanity of Chris Elliot. I hope this guy gets another T.V. show. Anyone see ""Get A Life""?.

1329578,3,B00003CY57,"'Scary Movie 2' is genuine Southern Gothic.  Too often this genre is smothered in atmosphere and over-ripe accents, so that true disgust is left out.
'Scary' is obsessed with the body.  The narrative proper begins with the heroine seeking advice on how to wear her clothes and move her body properly, as 'young' people do, as the presumed audience do.  This is a film in which the audience talks to itself - character doesn't matter, comedy doesn't even matter, as long as all the cultural, social and commercial reference points are recognised and assimilated.  As the movie continues, this sense of complicity between audience and characters based on clothes and the body is tested by a plot in which the body is deformed, disabled, abused, destroyed, violated, absorbed by alien forces, metamorphosed (in an extraordinary Kafkaesque scene, in which a dopehead turns into a giant spliff smoked by his marijuana plant); where bodily fluids become huge, grotesque, unmanageable, the 'reality' of the body hidden from the image, magnified and celebrated.
'Scary' may not be as funny as its predecessor and garners its laughs in reasing through disgust than 'humour', but this is an important cleansing function its sniffier critics can overlook.  After all, the best scene in 'Gulliver's Travels', one of the major artworks in the Western Canon, involving our hero and a palace fire, would not have been out of place in this film.",1000252800,,1429,5.0638297872340425

From the opening scene to the ending credits there is non-stop laughter, go to any recent showing of it and prove me wrong (the theatre will be rumbling). I've heard people say that it was overbudgeted and had no plot. There was a plot, it wasn't Shakespeare, Eddings, or Twain, shoot, it wasn't even Stiller. Scary Movie 2 is a comedy, a pure comedy, you're not supposed to get some deep philosophical meaning from it, you're supposed to laugh. There may be a few things that don't make sense, but can you name a pure comedy that does? Overbudgeted? Ha. There were a few familiar faces, but that only added to the quality of the movie.

Don't get me wrong if you loved the first one you will like this one but you will notice something missing.  Some of the jokes are recycled, some are very predictable there is nothing really original or new that we haven't seen before.  The opening scene is wonderfull very, very funny it gives hope for the rest of the movie but it's a let down after that.

My husband and I went to see it, as we both LOVED Scary Movie, but we left in utter disgust and disappointment.  We had no clue what the point of the movie was.  Sure, there were some funny parts, maybe a handful of them, but mostly it was repulsive humor.  I know a lot of people will like it, but I think it's an insult to people's intelligence to put garbage like that on the screen and expect people to laugh and enjoy it.  I'm no prude - I enjoy Scary Movie and I LOVE the American Pie movies, but Scary Movie 2 is pointless, poorly made, and just plain stupid.  The movies they parodied weren't even popular movies, which defeats the purpose of spoofing scary movies.  After seeing the movie, we saw the list of movies that were supposedly parodied, and we couldn't even point out where in the movie they were spoofed - for example - Castaway?  Anyway, from the first five minutes of the movie - the Excorcist scene - I knew this movie would suck.  We feel it was a complete waste of our time to see this movie.  I warned coworkers and friends not to see it, yet some saw it anyway, and they returned in agreement that it was a horrible movie and wished they had heeded our warnings.  Maybe, at 26, I'm just too old for this.  The teenagers in the theatre seemed to enjoy it, so I guess if you are a teen who liked the first one, you may like it because of all of the sexual and gross-out humor.

1329596,2,B00003CY57,"Being the Scary Movie fan that I am, I didn't hesitate to see the sequal.  Finding myself laughing at about 5% of the jokes, I started to wonder why this movie didn't work like the first one did.  I came to a couple conclusions.
1)  You cannot make a film in less than a year.  It is literally impossible.  The Wayans brothers had less than a year to write, produce, film and edit this movie.  The result?  A rushed, unfunny, big dissapointment.  I think if they waited at least 6 months to a year, they would have made a more successful movie.  They would have also had oppurtunities to spoof huge summer movies like Pearl Harbor, Planet of the Apes, The Mummy Returns, AI, Tomb Raider, or Cats and Dogs (which beat ot SM2 opening weekend.)  They should have taken their time.
2)  You cannot use the same jokes twice.  If you've seen the movie you will be able to determine which jokes were repeated. Not is it only unfunny, it also makes the audience dissapointed.  Why pay money to see a joke they could have watched 10 times on their DVD at home?  It just doesn't make sense.
3)  You cannot leave parts of the story left untied.  I left the theatre without relalizing what happened to any of the characters.  There was no story, no characters and no conclusion.  It was just attempted jokes loosely connected with more attempted jokes.  I have a real hard time liking a movie when I had no idea what happened in the movie.
4)  You cannot spoof unsuccessful movies.  While they spoof such high-grossing movies like The Exorcist and Charlie's Angels, people relate and then they laugh, a mixture for success, right?  Right.  Spoofed jokes aren't as funny when your spoofing House on Haunted Hill and The Haunting (which were both far from mainstream) or even Hollow Man (which was avoided by so many)
Overall, I was very sad that I wasted eight dollars on this movie.  It had potential and if they would have done many things differently, this movie may have been a huge success.  I wanted so bad for this movie to be good, but as we once heard from the Rolling Stones, ""You Cant Always Get What You Want.""  Shucks!

Just because the original movie makes over $100 million at the box ofice does not mean a make a sequel I was offended by the gay jokes of the character ""Shorty"" and a few other people in the movie. Not to mention there was no need to spoof ""The Haunting""(which this movie is a huge spoof!), ""Charlie's Angels"",""Mission Impossible 2 or MI:2"" ,""Hollow Man"" and ""What Lies Beneath"". The spoofs were OK.  The only good spoof of this movie is when they spoof ""The Exorist"" in the first ten minutes with James Woods as the priest. After that it goes downhill really fast!!I wanted to leave but I do not waste my movie just to watch 10 minutes of a movie.

If it took longer than that, I was fooled.  It is amazing how horrible a comedy can be, and I think this one might just take the award for the worst ever.  Unlike part 1, there was no coherent story.  Granted, the plot in part one wasn't totally solid, but in part 2- it wasn't there at all.  It seemed more like a series of skits that made no sense together, and none of them were funny at that.  The same old jokes used in the same exact way.  Some of the jokes in this movie were IDENTICAL to the jokes in part one...the ""sex"" scene being one of those.  Same fire hose like spray of liquid knocking the very annoying Faris down.  That's another thing...if that girl wasn't annoying in the first, in this one- she is so annoying you just want someone to strangle her to get her out of the movie.  I am very disappointed in the writers and everyone involved in making the film, because it seems like they thought they had to automatically make a part 2 to make some more cash, and they clearly thought it had to be made, edited, and released within a few days...that's what it looks like.

Scary Movie 2's target audience is unintellegent, immature teenagers. This is the reason it will do so well. This is unfortunate, but a fact of life.
The only part of this movie that was even remotely funny at all is the preacher's solo on the piano at the start of the film. It is all down hill from there. This movie paridoies every scary movie it can find and it does it badly. A group of mentally retarded 4 year olds with A.D.D. could have written a better movie.

I think SM2 was about equal to the 1st Scary Movie. The movie actually showed depth this time around with the script (compared to Scary Movie 1). In SM1, I found myself listening to identical lines from Scream movies far too much.
The heart of this movie relied on 3 things in my mind: An outstanding intro (which, unfortunately, got you hyped up for little reason), Chris Elliot (who was the hilarious caretaker) and the Nike Basketball spoof. I think for those reasons alone, this movie was worth the viewing. However, despite a nice ""Titanic"" spoof and a few other minor laughs, this movie fell short. About 80% of the movie consisted of blatantly stupid jokes that nobody laughed at.

I will admit that there were some funny parts, but not very many. I was a very big fan of the first Scary Movie and had high hopes that this one could be as fresh and funny as the original. Apparently the best that the Wayans brothers could do was to use some of the same sight jokes as before (yes I will spoil it and say that Cindy does get splashed to a wall again with the ""fluids of love"") Unfortunately this was already used in the first Scary Movie and was not necessary for the next one.

No doubt...Scary Movie 3 is in the works.  Trust me...they said the low budget flicks ""Night of the Living Dead"" and, more recently, ""The Blair Witch Project"" would never make it.  Wait and see. Scary Movie 2 will be a classic.",994377600,,909,4.487804878048781

1329625,3,B00003CY57,"After a short 1 hour of laughter, i was dissapointed in spending the cash to see this movie.  The funny new-ness of the comedy found in Scary Movie 1, left me expecting something a little better than what was found in SM2.  The story line of paradoies from other movies was there in a greater scale, however, it seemed that was all there was.  With little scene change one could tell that the producers were keeping to the cheap side.  Of course no real plot could be expected, but ... for a 1 hour movie, for this movie, is asking WAY TOO MUCH.  Wait for the video and DON'T get late charges for the return.",994377600,,608,4.252173913043478
1329626,1,B00003CY57,"Trust me, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and i even went to the first showing the day it came out.  And up until the title was shown, i enjoyed it.  The part at the beginning with the middle-aged white people singing ""Shake Ya Ass"" by Mystikal was pretty damn funny.  And I even liked the Exorcist rip off, especially James Woods as the priest.  After that, however, things took a nose-dive off of Mt. Everest. The plot is that seven kids participate in a weekend long study at a haunted mansion (ala ""The Haunting"").  While they are there, starange things happen, and suddenly they are trapped inside the mansion (ala ""The Haunting"" and ""House On Haunted Hill""), where they must confront the ghost so they can escape.  During the duration of the movie, many movies are spoofed.  Just to name a few: Hollow Man, Charlie's Angels, Mission: Impossible 2, and What Lies Beneath.  None of this, however, was even remotely funny.  The part I laughed at the most was when I was leaving the theater, laughing about how I wasted money and 90 minutes of my life on this movie.  I really thought this movie had the chance to live up to the first one, but it was no where near as funny or as clever as the first, which is still funny. Am I saying that sequels suck?  Absolutely not.  I'm just saying that in cases where the first film is a cult classic like this (and ""Friday""), there is no need to ruin the first by making a horrible sequel (""Next Friday"")",994377600,5,1466,4.42910447761194
1329627,1,B00003CY57,Boring.  Gross-out gags in volume do not make a comedy movie.  The number of spoken gags fall below 40.  The sight gags are timed wrong and far too annoying to be funny.  If you subtract the stupid things in this movie you have about 6 minutes left to view.  Far too much money for so very little.,994291200,5,297,4.140350877192983
1329628,5,B00003CY57,"So many times I see that people critique movies, such as this one. ""Scary Movie"" got that treatment, and this one will as well. I even saw one person review it before watching it, giving it the worst score. How is that?
Scary Movie 2 doesn't portray itself to be some meaningful movie, where there is a message involved. There is no message involved, and there wasn't meant to be a message involved. It's a movie that tries to get you to poke fun at the horror/supernatural movies out there, and it shows you that not everything should be taken so seriously.
If you want to go see a meaningful story with a message, I hear that ""A.I."" is good. However, if you want something that shouldn't be taken so seriously, try out ""Scary Movie 2"". You'll see stuff so outrageous that it will be funny.
I saw it and I didn't regret it. I expected a not-so-serious movie this time around and I knew what I was going to see, and that's why this was funny.
Stop critiquing movies so much and chill out a bit. Have fun. Life is too short to be so serious.",994291200,,1040,4.284263959390863

That said, this movie SUCKED!!! If you want to go see the parts in Scary Movie 2 so you can laugh, just watch the previews. Seriously....the funniest parts are the ones that are on the preview. I would of slept through it if I wasn't waiting patiently for some good parts. NEVER CAME!!!

1329630,4,B00003CY57,"Certainly not a mental challenge to view, but with the depressing economy and the everyday evening news to bring you down, it's nice to have some mindless fun every once in a while.
Most of the original cast is back from Scary Movie 1, with no explanation as to how those who were offed in the first one came back to life for the sequel. James Woods fills in for the opening scene (Marlon Brando was too sick to finish the Exorcist spoof) and it started the movie off perfectly. Soon, the troubled teens are away for a weekend in a haunted house, and the hilarious spoofs on recent hits such as ""Dude, Where's my Car?"" ""Charlies Angels"" keep the laughs coming.
This movie isn't for everyone, but if you liked the first installment, you're likely to like the second as well.",994291200,,773,4.450704225352113
1329631,2,B00003CY57,"This is pretty bad movie. The first scene where the spoof ""The Exorcist"" is admittedly extremely funny, if you enjoyed the original ""Scary Movie"". However it all goes downhill from there, with a weak, disjointed plot and [bad] jokes. Also the movie was extremely short, I was out of the theatre an hour and a half after the showtime, and that's including 4 or 5 trailers and a couple of ads. However, the movie's shortness is more merciful than anything.
The plot, such as it is, has the same cast from ""Scary Movie"" staying at a haunted house over a weekend. This is all set up by Tim Curry, playing an evil college professor whose motives are not really explained. Suffice it to say that some spooky things happen and there are parodies of The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal, The Haunting and Charlie's Angels, among others. The plot is much more disjointed than ""Scary Movie"", which is, in and of itself, kind of scary.

I'm writing this as someone who really enjoyed ""Scary Movie"" and who was very disappointed seeing ""Scary Movie 2"" on opening night. Don't bother seeing this in the theatre. If you enjoyed ""Scary Movie"", you might like renting it for a few scenes, but the laughs are few and far between. 2 stars is a fair rating, it's very weak, but there are a few good laughs.",994291200,14,1286,4.591304347826087

Anna Faris, Marlon, & Shaun Wayans really add to their characters from the first movie. Also the addition of the hot, hot female co-star (to re-place Shannon Elizabeth.) She really adds some nice ASSessts to the movie. I think all my scary movie go-ers will agree this is a good one. Please don't read Ian's review.

The first Scary Movie was defintely better than the first one.  I have to say I was very dissapointed.",994291200,,263,4.117647058823529
1329635,3,B00003CY57,"The good thing about Scary Movie 2 is that I did walk out of the theater feeling I had been entertained.  A lot of the jokes were pretty funny, some even bordering on intelligent(such as the Florida recount) and the movie was a lot less raunchy than the first. Now for the bad...this movie seemed more like a work of sketches(a la In Living Color) than a full fledged movie. It makes the first Scary Movie look like a work of art. It seems like the script was written around the gags rather than vice versa. There is no continuity in this film. At the end of the movie, I was like ""hey what happened to so and so's character??""  And what was Tori spelling in this movie? Her part was pointless.  Also some of the movie's parodied are kind of dated such as The Amittyville Horror(they should've done The Shining) All in all, I can recommend seeing this movie.",994204800,,858,4.35
1329636,2,B00003CY57,"This was a pretty dull movie.  The best part would be the opening(much like in the original), with James Woods.  Other than that, it was pretty crappy, and I don't really recommend it.  If your gonna go to a movie, I suggest ""The Fast and The Furious"", or maybe ""A.I.""  The sequel was the exact opposite of the first; the first one was hilarious, to the point of tears, and this was unfunny to the point of tears.  As far as sequels goes, I suggest waiting for ""American Pie 2"", or ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  Those two look like they have more to offer.  But I thought this had a lot to offer, so I guess looks really can be deceiving.  I gave this two stars because that's about how many time I really laughed. [...]",994204800,,725,4.202898550724638

It was a spoof off many films including, Charlies Angel's, Crouching tiger hidden dragon, Hollow Man, and a hilarious reenactment of Save the last Dance. I was pleased to see that they didn't over do it with the whole teen slasher genre, but I was hoping to see a little spoof on scream 3, or Urban Legends.
One thing that confused me was that, why was there several people in the film that were killed off in the first?????????
All in all its a pretty funny film with lots of crude and disgusting humor that will please all audiences.

1329640,1,B00003CY57,"I just got back from the early showing of Scary Movie 2 in my neighborhood, and let me tell you guys, Dimension Films has served us up another fine hack job.
I did not like Scary Movie 1 because I thought it was just a huge slap in the face to us fans of the horror genre. How could the movie company that brought us the ""Scream"" franchise release a movie mocking it's bread and butter? Well needless to say I was unhappy with ""SM1"" but when I saw the trailers for ""SM2"" they seemed funny to me, so I went to the movie expecting at least a funnier movie than the 1st. I was a sucker for thinking that.
The movie is boring, point blank. The site gags are lame, and the ones that aren't lame are spoofs of non horror flicks. The movie is also very short, but you don't realize because you are being bored to death. The movie starts off spoofing ""The Exorcist,"" it fell a bit flat. All the vulgar things Natasha Lyonne was saying were just a direct rip from the movie.
Fast forward to the gang from the first movie, who I thought died, in college. The are lured by Tim Curry to stay @ a haunted house with the promise of earning an automatic A for the course. The morons go. From this point the movie spoofs ""The Poltergeist,"" a Nike Commercial, the movie ""Paulie,"" ""Hannibal,"" ""Charlie's Angels,"" ""Weakest Link,"" ""Save The Last Dance,"" ""Hollow Man"",""The Haunting,"" and even Firestone tires.
In 1 year this film will not even seem funny to those who thought it was. It is filled with too many of the moment jokes. How could the priest in the beginning of the film thank God for getting Jeri from ""Survivor"" voted off? The movie is dumb.
I pity Anna Farris who will surely be forever typecast. She seems like a capable actress, she should not do a ""Scary Movie 3."" And guys you know there will be one. This pathetic flick will in fact do very well opening weekend, but drop off dramatically the next. It will not have strong word of mouth because the showing I went to was full of teens who left the theater yawning and complaining.
I was one of them, I should have just went to see ""The Fast And The Furious"" again.",994204800,,2112,4.2825
1329641,4,B00003CY57,"SCARY MOVIE 2 is the halarious sequel to the original SCARY MOVIE. This time, the plot is about the original survivors of the first film who are taken to a 'haunted' house in order to do a school project on it. The first film made fun of slasher movies, but the sequel is making fun of the supernatural horror movies such as ""The Exorcist,"" ""What Lies Beneath,"" and a whole slew of TV shows and commercials. The Wayans Brothers have once again proved themselves to be the masters of comedy for the new millenium. If you liked SCARY MOVIE, then you will love SCARY MOVIE 2!",994032000,,572,4.40566037735849
1329642,5,B00003CY57,"Scary Movie 2 proves that the Wayans's never run out of spoofs/jokes that are absolutely hilarious. Like in Scary Movie (2000), few jokes fall flat, and most succeed.
 This time, the opening scene is The Exorcist spoof, with Natasha Lyonne, Andy Richter, and James Woods. James Woods and Andy Richter do a ""laughably"" good job, while Natasha Lyonne is pretty funny as ""Regan."" Only one thing, like in Scary Movie, this part of the movie has nothing to do with the rest.
 The rest of the movie entirely spoofs the Haunting. Well, not ENTIRELY. Anna Faris returns as Cindy. Also returning are Brenda (Regina Hall), Ray (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans). Newcomers include Theo(Kathleen Robertson), Alex (Tori Spelling), Professor Oldman (Tim Curry), and Chris Elliot's character, Hanson, the caretaker of Hell House (where most of the movie takes place), who has disgustingly small hands (it's sick what he does with them, but also funny!). Anyway, the story follows the Haunting, where they're all taken to the House, and all Hell breaks loose. A hell of a lot of jokes, that is. I won't give any away, but if you've seen Scary Movie, you should expect Scary Movie 2 to be just as crude, sick, and vulgar as the original.
