989933,3,6305226652,"I searched your site for a Lone Ranger DVD or video that would be colorized.  When I ordered this item, I thought I read that it was ""in color"".  That was my mistake.  So my grandson, who doesn't have a clue about black and white TV, was very disappointed.  The adults were disappointed because it took so long to get our purchase.  It was coming from here in our state and it took 2 weeks to get it.",1205107200,,400,4.076923076923077
989934,5,6305226652,"This videodisc will not disappoint. The image clarity is quite good, but not as crystal clear as, for example, the 1950s classic black'n'white movie, ""It Came from Beneath the Sea."" The sound quality is excellent. In case you were wondering, the classic introduction featuring the William Tell Overture is there for you, along with the usually corny introductory monologue. There are four stories, Rustler's Hideout, War Horse, Pete and Pedro, and The Renegades. Rustler's Hideout is a classic story, about a pioneer settler who was wrongly accused, and had to spend some time in jail. At a later point, the mayor's son gets kidnapped by a gang. The pioneer settler, with some prodding from Mr. Lone Ranger, decides that it would be in his best interest to help rescue the mayor's son. This tactic succeeds, and the pioneer settler becomes a hero in the eyes of the community. Tonto has a prominent role in each of the four episodes.

What is funny is that at one point, where a cowboy is slinking across the desert, the music comes from a slow movement from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.  Nice music, but it came as a surprise to hear Beethoven as a form of desert music.

The stories are not just mindless action, as is found in the latest crop of Star Wars movies. In contrast, the Lone Ranger stories include episodes with misunderstandings, deception, trickery, etc. The Lone Ranger stories appear to have been filmed in the Alabama Hills in the Eastern Sierra, a part of the California wilderness noted for its large, rounded boulders, and also noted as the site for countless cowboy movies.

The Lone Ranger stories come with a narrative, though one might have to take part of the film's narratives with a grain of salt. At one point, the commentary discloses that the main goal of the U.S.government, at the time, was to protect the Indians from unscrupulous vandals. (Even the most ignorant of U.S. citizens might question this.)  Apparently, the script-writer was a confirmed revisionist historian.

As noted above, you might have to order Volume One in order to obtain the fine stories on the Volume Two disc. (I did not order Volume Two, and so I do not know if Volume Two contains inside the Volume One disk, or the Volume Two disk.)",1134000000,4,2246,4.790697674418604
989935,5,6305226652,"This Lone Ranger tape contains three episodes: ""The Tenderfeet,"" in which the Lone Ranger and Tonto thwart the plot of Hardrock Jones and Rusty Bates to steal the silver claim of Dick and Bob Larrabee, two brothers from the East; ""High Heels,"" in which the Lone Ranger and Tonto uncover Monk's plot to buy up various ranches in an effort to control some of the railroad (disappearing ink plays a vital role in this episode); and ""The Renegades,"" in which Tonto gets himself mistaken for a renegade Indian while trying to help his friend Chief Swift Eagle. This is a very enjoyable collection of episodes, something everyone who loves the Lone Ranger should get!",995328000,11,661,4.807017543859649
