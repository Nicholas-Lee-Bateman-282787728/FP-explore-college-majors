8194449,1,B000Q677A4,"what can i say about this movie? truth be told, i couldn't finish watching it. i don't want to be too harsh because he is master p and has done a lot for the music industry, but i really don't think very many of his movies are very good. i saw this flick about 6 months ago and all i remember is that i turned it off after about 20 minutes. thankfully i rented it and didn't buy it. i would suggest saving your money unless you collect underground indie movies or at least are a HUGE master p and tony cox fan, even still i can't recommend that you buy it.",1213228800,4,556,3.9732142857142856
8194450,1,B000Q677A4,"Horrible! Bad acting, Horrible editing, one of the characters disgusts me. Halfway into the movie, I was purposely fast forwarding the movie just to get it over. If i actually owned a copy of this movie I would immediately throw it straight in the garbage. This movie never should have even been released to the public. Words do not describe how awful this move was. If i could give it 0 stars I would.",1209427200,3,402,4.445945945945946
8194451,3,B000Q677A4,"This movie is not a bad indie movie at all, picture quality ain't the greatest but it has some funny parts.  Master P captures the hood supaman in a pretty good way and would recommend this movie if you are looking for a good laugh.  Movie also comes with free soundtrack but it only contains 9 songs but they are also good.",1187222400,6,324,4.209677419354839
