7910518,4,B00000IBOH,"brand new but the  dubbing.....it's a piece of work, not bad but not great either i wish that the cast that did the dub for the series would've been able to dub the movies",1443139200,,171,4.029411764705882
7910519,2,B00000IBOH,This movie was boring they prolonged it for so long what made it so boring not enough action. More talking then anything. If you like poor animation and the characters talking alot and not enough action then this is the one for you our if you like old animations.,996019200,,263,4.387755102040816
7910520,5,B00000IBOH,"This is the first installment to the first Gundam trilogy.  The movie is edited version of a TV show that is 20 years old, but the depth of the story and the characters far exceeds some of anime or even sci-fi movies today.  This is the anime that changed the history of anime.  This is the must see not only for anime fans, but those who shunted anime as kid stuff.",992908800,3,366,4.126760563380282
7910521,5,B00000IBOH,"You can't ask too much for an anime made in the late seventies . But imagine if the classic Beatles album ""Sgt. Pepper's.."" was made in stereo ? Would it sound so classic ? And what if the original Star Trek series were remade today ?  This movie is a true classic , and I can say that the plot does it all . All the gundam essence (psycological conflicts , politcs , science , and of course , action ) is there . The real classics surpass the difficulties of production , and become immortal .. What are you waiting to get it ?!",977702400,,529,4.038095238095238
7910522,5,B00000IBOH,"This is the best of any Gundam.  It shows how both sides are actual people.  And the mobile suits look better in this than any other Gundam series, they lack all that extra bullcrap seen so often in Gundam Wing.  Even though this is the oldest in the series, it is the best and I highly recomend it to any fan of mecha anime.  The animation in this anime is great if you have seen any newer mecha animes you can obviously see that it was influenced by Mobile Suit Gundam. This is a must have trilogy.",973555200,4,500,4.123711340206185
7910523,1,B00000IBOH,"I don't know where to start, the characters were boring, the animation stale, and absolutly no action.  I do have sympathy, this was the first ever movie and it obviously isn't going to be great but i have seen more action in a block of wood (coincedentaly, the gundam does look like a block of wood).  My sugestion is to look into later gundam series.",972518400,,352,4.4

7910525,5,B00000IBOH,"This movie is quite different from those of you who have just started watching the Gundam Wing series on the Cartoon Network, but it stacks up quite nicely. It starts out with a young boy living in the colonies at year  ""After Colony 079."" He somehow manages to find a Gundam and  pilots it to save his people from attacks from other colonys. It's a long  movie, but for us Gundam fans, we wish that is were longer. By the way, I  payed $5 more for it at a store, so don't pass up on this offer!",953078400,9,495,4.072164948453608
7910526,5,B00000IBOH,"This is a WONDERFUL movie if you are a hard kore anime fan. A great storyline, action packed, and beatiful animation. If you like the Gundam, Gundam Wing, and Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz series, BUY IT NOW!",952905600,3,205,4.5675675675675675
7910527,3,B00000IBOH,"Gundam the movie is what started the whole Saga. Back then, when there were very little computer graphics, amd it was hard to make a science fiction like this. Sure, Star Wars was great. but that's the US. In Japan where they don't have the multi trillion budget, the only way to create a  effective Sci-fi series that isn't corny and unrealistic is to animate it.  But even then the animation I thought was stil jerky, the characters were  old fashioned and something just wasn't right. In fact after the first hour  I fast fowarded through the second hour because it was getting so slow. But  something about it made me wanna watch it again. I didn't want to re-sell  it suddenly and I decided to have a second viewing without fastforwarding  it this time.  This movie, isn't super. But the plot is. The drawback is  the ""at times poor"" and old fashioned animation. The fact is that  even though it may be slow at times, for the most part it does what it does  good though it could be better.  FOR EVERY GUNDAM FAN I say buy this  because it's worth it. But it's up to you if you want to buy the second and  third movie.  If you don't know what Gundam is, then frankly I recomend  Gundam 0080,0083, because those are good without excuse, and its hard to  love this unless you're a Japanese Gundma fan, or a dedicated non-Japanese  fan.  Just keep in mind that this was something new to the world, just like  Star WArs was. Relatively speaking Gundam has no match with Star Wars  budget wise and quality wise. But I hope all of you fans appreciate the  drama and effort put behind this series that has been around for over 2  decades already, and showing no sign of stopping. As for the story summary.....please read other reviews....(^^; because I did my best to reflect my opinion without leaning over to one  side",950745600,13,1817,4.452887537993921
