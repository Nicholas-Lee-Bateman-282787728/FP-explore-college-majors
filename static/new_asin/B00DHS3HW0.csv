Towards the end it gets even more confusing. Knights of Malta? I have a hard time believing some of the things that are talked about in this movie. But again, horrible, horrible picture. I do not recommend this to anybody.",1461542400,,358,4.609375
8593377,1,B00DHS3HW0,"I think this is a total fraud.  The so-called Federale is not proficient enough in Spanish even to pronounce names correctly, and one of the claimed facts is verifiably false while other off-hand claims are highly suspect.

8593378,1,B00DHS3HW0,"I thought the narrator was not good in that he did not even pronounce the names of the town in Mexico correctly.....Ojinaga.....or even Pablo's last name Acosta correctly.  I mean, come on....you're the narrator, the interviewer, shouldn't you know how to pronounce the name of the town or the people you are discussing?  I thought the sound effects on the film...the constant gunshots were misplaced and for shock value/sensationalism only.  I thought the footage of the towns was poor.....the story was not congruent .....the photos of the dead again---shock value....rather than being incorporated into the story in such a way as to have true meaning.  If you want an account of Pablo Acosta's life and death and the environment of drug trafficking at that time....read the book DRUG LORD by Terrence Poppa.  I do feel that the narrator and Lobo's working to provide medical supplies to those hospitals in need is highly commendable and  I applaud their good deeds.  I do not see, however, how that part of the documentary (the ending) relates at all to the beginning of the documentary......it seems as if there are two separate stories being told.  The reality of people in power being paid to protect criminals and criminal behavior is itself a true crime and I feel a HUGE story that needs to be told....but I feel the narrator failed in bringing to light through his documentary what Terrence Poppa so clearly brought to light in his book DRUG LORD.",1403654400,2,1457,4.894308943089431
8593379,5,B00DHS3HW0,"I am very fortunate to be involved with this film.  This film exposes so much of the crime that takes place just over our borders (and, indirectly, within them).  This is a must-see film for people who are curious about the extent of the corruption that comes with power.",1372809600,2,271,4.510204081632653
8593380,5,B00DHS3HW0,"This film is deep, thought-provoking and provocative. Cover your eyes if you don't want to know the truth! This movie will challenge you, as it probes deep into the essence of soul, through a lens that exposes redemption through vehicles of greed and corruption. If you want to experience the true essence of man--what's possible, both positive and negative--then, this movie is for you!",1372291200,2,387,5.0625
8593381,5,B00DHS3HW0,"Mr. Carlin has been willing to venture into a world where few others would be prepared to tread, i.e., the world of murder, mayhem and life on the very edge in one of Mexico's most troubled and violent cities, where crime is a serious business and vengeance follows any real or perceived betrayal.  And Mr. Carlin has ventured there without any seeming regard for his own life and safety.  An extraordinary documentary film viewing experience.  Joel Fishman",1371945600,2,457,4.909090909090909
8593382,5,B00DHS3HW0,"A wake up call for America.  The genocide of thousands, right on our border, all because of the cartels are emboldened by the money to be made, and the power to be had, supplying our insatiable appetite for drugs. Michael Douglas Carlin needs to be applauded for his courage in filming this documentary and making it public.",1371859200,2,324,4.684210526315789
