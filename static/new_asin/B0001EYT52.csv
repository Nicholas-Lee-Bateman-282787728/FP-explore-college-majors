1994641,3,B0001EYT52,"The original full length version of The Trip is fun, and a humorous look (though it's suppose to be serious, but that's what makes it fun and a good time capsule of Hollywood version of the 60's) the wonderful 60's yet LA & Hollywood always gets it so wrong from the clothes to the ""hip"" talking, even the hair - pop bubble-gum, always missing the point completely.  The Trip too is a bit overboard in it's silliness of ""hippie philosophy"" although I'm sure somewhere there was people gullible enough to take in the phony BS parts that were indeed out there, as we can all imagine and all know of at least one lost crazy ""seeker"" leader.....instead of the real and positive things that were truly happening that are rarely & purposely not mentioned nor shown in most period or ""nostalgia films""....Yes, believe me dropping acid was truly an eye and door opener and lots of fun in many situations. (as so many knew, Aldous Huxley, JFK, Stanley Kubrick, Steve Jobs, etc. etc.)  especially listening and dancing on it at live music venues like the old Fillmore Auditorium....But this cut version of this film (85 minutes) doesn't do the time period nor the ""trips"" justice....See the original version, (119 minutes) a bit over the top but still great fun to see actors like Bruce Dern, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Susan Strasberg, living the LA version of the ""Hippie"" certainly not the political, environmentally conscious, free, mind expanding, love & caring ant-war that evolved from about 1965 to early 1967 about 424 miles further up the coast in San Francisco, the Bay Area & the further up northern California coast from Marin County up to Humboldt). Before the government, as they always do, bring in the hard drugs to destroy what they can't understand, don't have complete control over and that interrupts capitalist conformity they'll throw the old negative label on it through their media lap dogs...... written by Jack Nicholson, directed by the legendary Roger Corman - Is there an original version (119 minutes) on DVD or Blu-Ray out there?",1379116800,5,2052,4.86
1994642,5,B0001EYT52,"Wow, will it ever get this good again? Great Director, love it, love it, love it, a must have for all movie libraries. Peter Fonda this movie, Easy Rider a few others just make a movie collection",1371859200,,195,4.297297297297297
1994643,4,B0001EYT52,"THE TRIP (1967) is an artsy-fartsy Roger Corman movie that typified the hippie era. Written by Jack Nicholson, and starring Peter Fonda, Susan Strasburg, Bruce Dern and Dennis Hopper, it's the story of an acid-dropping motorcycle gang. Music is by The Electric Flag (a personal fave).

The very conservative Corman actually tried LSD before making this because he wanted to understand how it affected the mind. He had a ""good trip"" so he still needed to consult someone on what a ""bummer"" was like.

After some years of battling, ""The Trip"" caused director Corman's final break with American International Pictures co-owner Sam Arkoff after the latter axed many of this picture's best moments (the druggy stuff) and overdubbed ""God's voice"" at the end, thus spoiling the effect and meaning of its final scene.

Definitely worth seeing as the period piece it is.

Supporting cast includes Corman faves Luana Anders, Beach Dickerson and Dick Miller. Uncredited cameos: Peter Bogdanovich, former child actor Brandon De Wilde, musician Gram Parsons (this Flying Burrito Brother ODed in '73 at age 26), and ubiquitous little person Angelo Rossitto.",1343433600,4,1143,5.229508196721311
1994644,5,B0001EYT52,This movie is better and much more artistic than I could have ever dreamed. The only drawback is that it's not in US (region 1) format. :) That's ok though because I can watch it on my computer. It also as many generous viewing choices. I got it for like 7 in total :D,1310083200,3,268,3.9814814814814814
1994645,2,B0001EYT52,"The Trip?  Steely Dan may have said it best: ""Show biz kids making movies of themselves an they don't give a....funk(?) about nobody else?"" I cant remember. And I couldn't remember much about ""The Trip"".  I saw it at the drive inn when it came out.  I was 16 and smoking pot like it was going out of style!  So that must be why I can't remember, right? There must have been some pretty cool stuff to ""trip on""....right?  Well, other than the house with the upstairs indoor/outdoor swimming pool, there's not much artistic value, special effects or soundtrack worth remembering.  But the house, it's self had extreme historical value.  At the time, it was home of the band ""LOVE.""  As in ""7&7 is - Love"" (that's how it looked on my KRLA Top Forty Playlist.)  It's a shame they weren't asked to participate in this movie. Because they were, as far as I know, the first commercially successful inter-racial rock band.  I LOVE came together in L.A.  late 1965' when composer, guitarist and lead vocalist Arthur Lee asked another brother, and 3 of his lighter skinned friends, 2 white, 1 Latino, to join musical forces.  They had the perfect hippie name and attitude, more than a year before a hint of a ""Peace, Love"" hippie.  A real cutting edge band, they combined rock, blues, jazz and Latin influences. They beat Lou Reed and The Stones to the future with the first heroine/suicide blues ballad: ""SIGNED D.C."" inspired by the suicide note left by their first drummer. Talk about street cred and cult status!  A band full of outrageous musical mood swings.  They were the perfect hippie rock band, which also, ironically recorded the perfect blue print for a punk anthem in ""7&7 is,""  later to be recorded by The Ramons, and others, but none could match the rage of the original black  vocalists!  But this film wasn't as ground breaking. And the music sucks!  It seems the so-called writers just guessed at what a ""trip"" might be. There's no real special effects. More like they just threw together random film clips, mixed with Fonda's home movies of Malibu.  And why the dixieland jazz when Fonda realizes he's gonna get laid? Seriously? How lame is that?  Would've been a good time for some LOVE from the house band!  Hey Peter! Dennis! Bruce! You guys really blew it!  Such a shame. Bet ya LOVE could've gotten this film into the Rock& Roll Hall of Fame. So far as show biz kids go, The Monkees were way more cool, and way more, in the words of Mickey Dolenz:""Psychedelic!"" Now I guess I'll have to buy their trip movie, ""HEAD.""",1460073600,,2531,4.612975391498882

1994654,1,B0001EYT52,"Some films are controversial and experimental for the sake of being controversial and experimental and really don't validate their reputation with anything of actual merit.  That is sadly the case with this trippy little movie from 1967.  Instead of challenging the audience and delivering something with any sort of profound or even enlightening message, this movie exists for the sole purpose of showing Peter Fonda dropping acid and exploring a dream world.  The terrible acting from Fonda and Bruce Dern took me out of the film's dreamlike narrative and basically squandered any effect it would have had on me.  Sure, it is visually arresting and quite fascinating in that regard, but at the end of the day this film says absolutely nothing and left me not only detached from it but quite bored and disinterested.  I understand that it has its fans, but I can't honestly see why anyone would want to see or recommend this if not for the big disclaimer that states that this was, at one point, banned.",1379548800,2,1004,4.847953216374269

I've had several versions of this movie.  Does the new 2016 unrated one have all the footage?  It's very confusing.

I heard the VHS version has the most footage.  Is that true as well?",1474243200,2,222,4.317073170731708
