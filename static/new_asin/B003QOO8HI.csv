8402345,4,B003QOO8HI,"Really nice workout. Very high impact; a bit much on the joints. Might have to dance along a few times before choreography sticks, but overall a nice cardio workout. No regrets in my purchase.",1481068800,,192,4.676470588235294

8402349,1,B003QOO8HI,"I bought one of her DVD before Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body (2008)
and I loved it, I thought that this DVD was going to be the same as the last one or even better... is boring for me... I don't recommend it!!!!",1335484800,,214,3.8863636363636362
8402350,5,B003QOO8HI,"I work out regularly using circuit training and interval/strength training dvds, (like The Firm and Jillian Michaels) but I like to do more cardio-focused dvds in between those workouts. I have enjoyed trying out various ethnic dance workouts because they get your heart rate up but aren't as taxing on major muscle groups as some of the more serious cardio training type dvds. I am not a dancer, though I usually catch on eventually if I can do something enough times. I really liked this dvd for the very reason that the person who wrote the most critical review disliked it. The moves are repeated over and over throughout the routines, and you do them long enough in a set before switching to a different step. You can catch up even if you miss a cue or aren't catching on to the step very quickly. I get frustrated if I have to do a workout six times to ""learn"" it well enough to actually get a good workout. I would rather focus on form and intensity than keeping up with complicated choreography. So this routine was great, because the first time through I felt like I was with it most of the time. I am in pretty good shape, and it got my heart rate up, and felt like a pretty good core workout, unlike some of the other ""beginner"" level dance dvds that have easier dance routines, but don't really challenge your body either.",1301443200,,1334,4.448979591836735
8402351,3,B003QOO8HI,"I guess you could say I have exercise boredom, so I vary my dvds frequently.  I enjoy dance probably the most and it doesn't seem to matter what kind, if I can learn steps and be challenged I am up for it.  This being said, I wasn't over the moon about this one.  The instructor was energetic and danced well, but the routine itself was a bit boring and I could not imagine myself doing this more than once or rotating it in with my weekly favorites.  The moves were pretty easy to catch if you have done dance videos before.  I would say this dvd would be suited best for someone that has done some dance, but would classify themselves as beginner/intermediate.  They would be able to catch a lot of steps but would be challenged with a few of them (being challenged is a good thing!).  I felt after I borrowed this from the library that I wouldn't purchase it and actually only ended up doing it once, it just wasn't ""fun"" enough to be one that I would add to my collection.

Overall, the instructor was good, knew her stuff, and most cuing was fine, but the work was a little repetitive and boring.  In my opinion, a better dance video with a latin flavor would be Brazillian Dance by Vanessa Isaac.  That dvd had the ""fun"" factor for me and got my heart rate moving.  It may just be the difference between a beginner and a more intermediate dvd.",1293580800,5,1349,4.292490118577075
8402352,4,B003QOO8HI,"I have the downloaded version of this dvd from Acacia, and I will say right front the top, the sound quality sucks.  Kimberly is much louder than the music and there is no music only option, of course. But having said all of that this is an ok dvd.  None of her dvds match the fun factor of her 1st dvd. This one is energetic but the music just wasn't my cup of tea.  For those of you thinking that this is Brazilian carnival music, it isn't.  It is mostly Trinidadian soca/jump up music.  Carnival is held all over the world and in Trinidad the music is calypso.  If you like that type of music than this dvd is for you. As for the moves, the entire dvd will make you sweat.  The moves are easy to learn and the timing is not as syncopated as her abs burn dvd. It's really hard to give you details other than it's a sweaty workout that can be enjoybable if you like the music.  I've done it once and I haven't been motivated to do it again.  I really wish that she would do a longer version of 'lovely legs' from her lower body burn dvd.  Kimberly is such a good dancer and a modern/jazz intermediate dvd would be perfect.  Are you listening Acacia??",1288569600,3,1151,4.13963963963964
8402353,5,B003QOO8HI,I have tried all of Kimberly Miguel Mullen's Dance and Be Fit workouts and this is by far my favorite. I am not a dancer or an athlete and I am someone who has a hard time motivating to workout but after recently starting a new job where I spend 8 - 10 hours a day sitting in a crappy office chair in front of a computer I have found myself actually looking forward to getting home to workout with this DVD.  After sitting in the same position all day the moves in these routines actually feel like a wonderful massage for my tight and aching back. The steps are challenging enough to keep it interesting but also free and fun enough for me to really let loose and enjoy myself. And I really get a good sweat going too! Kimberly's spirit and sunny personality make it almost impossible not to to have a good time as I imagine myself dancing down the streets of Rio during Carnaval!,1284854400,3,881,4.244047619047619
8402354,4,B003QOO8HI,"The three workouts on this DVD also appear on Exercise TV and are all instructed by Kimberley Miguel Mullen.  If you have tried other Dance and Be Fit workouts by Kimberly or other instructors, you will probly like this DVD as well. The three sections vary as to level of aerobic activity and difficulty of moves, but overall, I found the workouts to be easy to follow.  I think her cuing is adequate.  If I'm going to do a dance workout, I typically do hip hop and bellydance.  I tried this workout for a little variety and enjoyed it.  I think people with little or no dance experience will be able to pick up most of the moves on first or second try.  Each section has a warm-up with basic hip circle moves and signature carnival moves like the ""road march.""  Then, you have about 15 minutes of dancing.  Some of the moves you learn are the ""double and single hip pushes,"" ""body wind,"" ""vanity arms,"" ""butterfly arms,"" ""snake arms,"" ""hip wiggles"", ""toe heels,"" and ""leg dips.""  Finally, there is a short cool down.  Based on level of difficulty, I recommend it most to people that are beginner dancers or want to try something different.",1279756800,4,1140,4.517073170731707
