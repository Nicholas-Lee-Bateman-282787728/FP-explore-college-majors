2711647,5,B000LP6L20,"My 2-year old loves Eloise and her 6-year old sister has become enchanted by her as well.  ""Santa"" brought this movie and the girls watched it the other day.  They both thoroughly enjoyed it.  My 2-year old doesn't normally sit through a movie but for Eloise she does every time!",1198972800,,279,4.54

8162896,3,B000LP6L20,I got this movie for my 4 yr old she didn't like it as much as the Christmas one because it doesn't have as many of her friends from the hotel in it and the new friend she makes is not very nice. Maybe better for older kids.,1501459200,,224,3.6875

8162902,3,B000LP6L20,"Make sure you know that this is animated and not a movie, like ""Eloise at the Plaza."" My mistake.  A little pricy for 45 minutes.",1292544000,,129,4.16
8162903,5,B000LP6L20,"I enjoyed watching the movie ""Eloise In Hollywood"". It was very lively and hilarious! Much more interesting than the book. The movie doesn't seem to follow the book super closely, but the adaptation for film works.  I thought it was funny how the aspiring actress ""Debbie Lincoln"" looked and acted a lot like Nellie Oleson from Little House On The Prairie.  It's a good and entertaining movie for the entire family.",1288396800,,415,4.830985915492958
