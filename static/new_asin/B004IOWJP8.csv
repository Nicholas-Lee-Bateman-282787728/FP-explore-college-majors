Even my 15-year-old sister found herself getting into Infinity Sock and moving to the music.  Each video is fun, eye-catching, and engaging and the songs keep you laughing, smiling, and singing out loud (whether or not your kids are in the room).  The lyrics are simple, yet insightful and introspective.  ""Question Marks"" is a personal favorite of mine on this album, as it reminds me of my 6-year-old son's current perspective on the world.

Put aside those Wiggles CDs, and open your world to Gustafer Yellowgold.  You won't be disappointed! Be sure to check out the other 3 albums (Wide Wild World, Have You Never Been Yellow, and Mellow Fever) as well.  You will soon fall in love with Gustafer, Forrest Applecrumbie, Slim, and a whole cast of characters.",1298678400,,892,4.790849673202614

8431067,5,B004IOWJP8,"As a fan of Morgan Taylor and Gustafer Yellowgold from the past, this new DVD/CD is a great addition to his musical repertoire. When I got it the first thing that I did was share it with the kids and even into the first song that were dancing and twirling aroud the floor (a good sign or a good CD to be sure). Playing the DVD engaged their attention and even my wife and I enjoyed both the music and the other hidden gems that the DVD shares. I found myself humming the tunes even after they had been long over, so you can tell that the music grows on you and we already have been asked to bring the yellow guy CD into the car next time we go somewhere, so you know that means we will be listening to this CD for a while and the DVD will surely follow.

The DVD was great as it did provide great music but had some great bonus features as well. There are Gustafer Guitar Lessons and drawing lessons on how to draw Gustafer with Morgan Taylor. If you read the DVD/CD it says that it is recommended for ages 4 and up, but even our 3 year old enjoyed it...so I guess age is relative. The DVD does run an hour and a half, so just be aware of this as you sit down with the family to enjoy!",1295913600,,1185,3.9581589958158996
