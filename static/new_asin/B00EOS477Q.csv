5931769,5,B00EOS477Q,I love this series. And the way the cases are.,1443744000,2,46,3.7
5931770,5,B00EOS477Q,"The complete boxset of a loved canadian tv series. CONTAINS THE ENTIRE SEASON 1 T0 SEASON 5 SERIES or season 1 to season 6 series as it was aired/distributed on the U.S. tv stations. The original problem people had with this boxset, is that it originally on release to the U.S., it didn't have the complete season 6 on it  which debuted as a complete season 5 in canada. But AMAZON seems to have rectified or fixed this problem. THIS BOXSET has both the season 6 and web episodes that may not have aired in the U.S. all packed into the final season five dvd. A must have for FLASHPOINT FANS especially if you grew up on SWAT tv series and POLICE ACADEMY tv series like i did this is a welcome addition to those type of franchises. A POLICE/COP TVseries filled with responsibilities and repercussions of every decision the team makes and how it affects the society around them.",1443398400,76,876,4.475

I've written to phase4films but they don't respond, so I'd appreciate feedback from customers. Thanks.",1475107200,,232,4.825
5931793,5,B00EOS477Q,I was quite sad when this show was cancelled.  All of the characters in this show are wonderful to watch and you really feel like you're at the scene with them.  This set is the complete Canadian series and this is what you need to get; forget the American release.  I'm slowly working my way through the entire series as I want to spread out the enjoyment of the show.  They're just as great the second (and third for some of the episodes) time around.,1475107200,2,453,4.294117647058823

5931803,5,B00EOS477Q,"Love, love, love this series.  It's on late TV almost nightly, but I couldn't resist the chance to get the complete series and watch my favorite episodes whenever I want to.  Such a great show that ended way too soon.

Only quibbles is that the season cases within the box don't have episode listings or guide sheets, and the episode names/numbers aren't printed on the discs for easy identification.  But those are small issues.

* An issue I've just encountered as I've been going through the various seasons watching them on TV is that the first and second seasons in particular are very chaotically organized (which is a total oxymoron).  It's clear to me now that those seasons are grouped by the Canadian airing format and not the American broadcast seasons.  For example, what in the US were the first four episodes of season 2 (Eagle 2, Backwards Day, Haunting the Barn, and Between Heartbeats) are on the third disc of season one--which would have been more readily apparent if the season issue information was included as I already noted.  And later in season two, the discs in the case are labeled as 4,5, and 6, but on the screen are termed ""season 2 volume 2 discs 1, 2, and 3"").  Very confusing.

I also wish that there had been more special features, but perhaps that wasn't/isn't something typical of Canadian shows--I don't know.  I would have enjoyed profiles of more characters than just Greg Parker and Ed Lane.  Also lacking is any sort of close-caption option.  There have been several times during various episodes where I've wondered just what a character said, but just don't know because CC isn't available.",1456099200,14,1633,4.7686832740213525

8607582,5,B00EOS477Q,"Flashpoint is an absolutely awesome show!  I really enjoyed all 5 seasons and every episode.  It is a good drama show, and you can watch it without having to overlook nudity, language, or extreme violence.  I highly recommend this show!",1528675200,,236,4.85

8607585,5,B00EOS477Q,"Loved the show when it aired on TV but it kept jumping around time slots and I missed quite a few episodes. I was so excited to receive the series in fall and watched every night. Great action, loved the way the characters interacted and it showcased what police officers experience in intense situations, showing their Human Side.",1509667200,,331,4.724137931034483
8607586,4,B00EOS477Q,"I have to say out of all the options for buying this show its the best one. I was given the first three seasons as a gift and found out the copys I was given had only half of season two. After research found out that season two is split into 2 parts volume 1 and 2. This box has both parts. I could be wrong but I believe another season is like that as well. I think the final season. The box has all the episodes. Now the part Im kinda unhappy with, the episodes are in an odd order. Found out after buying this the show is on Hulu. A lot of the episodes are in different orders. And then went back and compared the other seasons I previously owned. They are in another order that doesnt match Hulu or this copy. The episodes are in the correct seasons. And it doesnt confuse main plot points like a death or anything. Just found it rather odd. I do recommend this however. Just not good for binge watching with a streaming app for when your away from a DVD player.",1509408000,2,966,4.06282722513089

8607588,5,B00EOS477Q,"Perfect!!!  Please be aware there are no subtitles to this set if you need them.  It also follows the original episode lineup set for Canada so there is no ""final"" season (equiv to season 6).  There are only 5 seasons.",1505260800,2,218,4.4
