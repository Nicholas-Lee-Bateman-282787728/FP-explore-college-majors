8146691,1,B000IOHU3I,"I grew up in a small town, virtually single student in my school was being raised Christian.  This was our sex ed program.  There were approximately 25 girls in my grade, of those five were pregnant (out of wedlock) before high school graduation.  I don't even want to know what the rates of STIs were.

This program is horrible.  It is fear and shame based.  It does not provide students with the tools they need to make smart choices, including the choice to be abstinent or engage in safe sex.  The information was dated when we watched it.

I suggest the Our Whole Live curriculum through the United Church of Christ in place of this.",1413072000,,638,4.48695652173913

8146694,5,B000IOHU3I,This video was so well done.  It really does a great job getting the message across to teenagers.  If your child is unsure of what to do - It will reaffirm your childs decision to do the right thing.  I would definitely recommend this video.,1208736000,2,241,4.311111111111111
