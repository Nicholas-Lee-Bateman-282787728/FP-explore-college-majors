529464,5,6302969581,"Distant and removed from the immediate environment is how one could illustrate Andrew Crocker-Harris (Michael Redgrave) who is notorious as the Crock among the students at an English public school where he teaches the Classics.  He is the archetype for a hated teacher, as he plagues his students with precise etiquette and dreary epigrams.  In essence, he is a eloquent and subtle bully that oppresses his students whenever they fail.  Like a cold reptile the Crock snaps at all available opportunities for him to be perceived as an authoritative source.  This causes his students to become preoccupied with what is wrong rather than what is right, as they strive to avoid error instead of learning.

In the light of present educators, it should be noted that teachers should try to catch the students doing good, as it will promote a positive learning environment.  It does not suggest that the teachers should turn a blind eye to harmful or negative behavior, as this can be detrimental to academic achievement for the students.  Here in the Browning Version Anthony Asquith directs a very different film compared to his other accomplishments such as Pygmalion (1938) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1952).  This film deals with failure rather than success.  The failure of Mr. Crocker-Harris to fulfill his life calling to the potential and to be revered as a superior colleague and educator by both students and faculty.

Nonetheless, Asquith remains honest to what he does best by making adaptations of novels and plays.  The Browning Version does not bring the flamboyant joyfulness that many of his other films do.  Instead, he delivers a dark and emotional story, which is the result of a play that Asquith visited in the late 1940s.  He felt that he needed to make the film, but struggled with financial backing.  Eventually, the money came around and he could focus on directing a personal epigram through the character that Michael Redgrave so delicately performs in this memorable film.  The film went on to win the awards both for best actor and screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952.

Asquith opens the story with an external perspective of Mr. Crocker-Harris who emerges with an authoritarian and humorless persona.  He follows a rigid schedule, as the students even have their watches set after his.  In many aspects, it seems like nothing is allowed to bother Mr. Crocker-Harris, as if he has already been put to rest.  To strengthen this notion, his wife Millie (Jean Kent) says, ""You can't hurt Andrew. He's dead.""  On top of this, the only thing that seems to provide some form of joy for him are the Classics of long ago fallen philosophers and scholars such as Socrates, Plato, and Aeschylus.  Amidst all of this there is an overwhelming sense of gloom and lifelessness around Mr. Crocker-Harris who also has acquired severe health problems.

The film rubs on the surface of contempt and hatred while it slowly submerges into a personal tale.  It is through Mr. Crocker-Harris's lifeless persona a remarkably tender story begins to brew.  The surfacing true thoughts of him begin to unsettle his disciplined and razor sharp mind, as some even refer to him as the Himmler of the lower Fifth.  One true notion follows by another, which begins to rupture the strong and cold front that he has put on to be perceived as a strong individual.  Meanwhile, his wife is cheating on him with another younger and more dynamic teacher, as her contempt for him continually increases.  It is emotionally torturous to watch this old man being struck with one setback after another despite his past.

The film discloses the failure of one man, which is something that Asquith was accustomed to on a personal level.  Maybe, it is here where he discovered the emotional turmoil that he implemented in the film, as he grabs the audience over the throat with iron grip of melancholic sympathy.  Asquith's father was a former Prime Minister and his mother, an eminent woman in high society.  Thus, when their son became a film director, it must have been frowned upon with the notion of failure since their son had all the opportunities in the world.  Failure, or not, Asquith and Mr. Crocker-Harris' lives could only be successes, if love were to be given to themselves through the small victories of self respect and personal forgiveness.",1120694400,11,4356,4.916552667578659

His wife reall neglects him and she without any doubt decides to cheat him. He will suffer in silent voice the painful betray.

Certainly, you must be in mood to appreciate this outstanding picture, but the effort will be rewarded. A superb artwork in many senses. Redgrave once more proves he was one of the complete and solid actors of his generation.

He's an ailing instructor in the classics whose attempts at wit succeed as little more than classroom cruelty.

529467,4,6302969581,"Michael Redgrave turns in a sterling performance as one of British cinema's most pitiful and tragic creatures: Terence Rattigan's despised schoolmaster, Andrew Crocker-Harris. Rattigan works from his own one-act play, the major difference being the longer (and more hopeful) ending. It is some ten or fifteen minutes or so before Redgrave appears, with the result that the character is built up in the mind of the audience as something of a legend, known of only through the semi-apocryphal caricatures related by the other characters. This sets the stage nicely for the gradual revelation of Crocker-Harris's humanity underneath the cold, passionless exterior. Redgrave is particularly campy when he initially appears, but soon settles down into a more subdued, but brilliantly acted performance. The actor (whose name escapes me) playing the young Taplow also manages an excellent performance, noticeably devoid of the stiltedness and artificiality that is present in so many other child actors of his generation.
Rattigan's story is told melodramatically, but believably, through the lens of veteran photographer Desmond Dickinson's camera, and (as expected) tightly executed by Anthony Asquith. The central performances are bolstered by impressive supporting players. Also worth seeing is Albert Finney's (almost equally affecting) performance in the Figgis version, some forty-five years later.",1038355200,6,1399,5.796116504854369
529468,5,6302969581,"Terence Rattigan's screenplay for ""The Browning Version"" expands and greatly improves his short stage play of the same name.  The title refers to a translation by the poet, Robert Browning, of ""Agamemnon,"" a classical Greek tragedy.  The film's protagonist, Andrew Crocker-Harris, an English private school teacher brilliantly played by Michael Redgrave, once wrote a translation of ""Agamemnon,"" and has been trying for years to teach 14-year-old boys to read the Greek original.  Because of poor health and general dissatisfaction with his performance, he has resigned his position.
In the tragedy, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, aided by her lover.  In the film, Crocker-Harris is spiritually dead, partly from spousal ""murder,"" although the slaughter has been reciprocal, and his wife, Millie, is in worse shape than he.  In tragedies, the hero starts out happy and becomes miserable.  In this film, full of the sadness of professional and domestic failure, Crocker-Harris moves away from misery, via understanding and heartfelt repentance, to the possibility of happiness.
The reversal owes much to the intervention of Taplow, one of Crocker-Harris' students, and of Frank Hunter, his colleague and Millie's lover.  The film deftly introduces these ""good Samaritans"" in a lively dispute, in which they display the personal qualities that will make them helpful to Crocker-Harris.  Both are spirited, bold, good-natured, intelligent and well-rounded.
An interesting question is why they come to the rescue of Crocker-Harris and not of his wife.  Her coarse brutality toward Crocker-Harris is hard to forgive, but so is his refined humiliation of students.  At the outset, two huge defeats, heart disease and forced resignation, invite our compassion for him.  His language, beautifully dressed, raised in pitch but never in volume, quiet, clear, restrained, invites attention and leaves room for helpers. Following Taplow's lead, we start the film wondering what is wrong, and hoping to fix it.  But most important, Taplow and Hunter appreciate this man, who is really dying to be liked.  They like him, and they don't like Millie.
My only criticism of the screenplay is the audience response, at a school assembly, to Crocker-Harris' farewell speech.  The reaction is not realistic, I think, given the school's long-established fear and rejection of this man.  But it is surely our reaction, after what we have just experienced.
At the Cannes Film Festival, Terence Rattigan was awarded Best Screenplay and Michael Redgrave, Best Actor.  Emphatically deserved!  The film is beautifully directed by Anthony Asquith, with a fine cast, especially Brian Smith as Taplow and Nigel Patrick as Hunter.

529469,5,6302969581,"Michael Redgrave, that's who!  Surely his has got to be one of the greatest performances of our century.  The words ""Magnificent"" and ""Brilliant"" only come near to describing the work of this actor in this film.
Be prepared to feel sad, and even cry.  This is a film about the death of humanity and the concommitant loss of self-esteem in a person.  Yet the story bespeaks compassion and love of fellow man.
The perfect direction by Anthony Asquith and a fine supporting cast draws one in from the get-go.  Redgrave holds one spellbound.  I can't praise it too much, and if any film buff misses this one, he is sorely lacking in the knowledge and experience of the very best.",1004918400,5,675,4.583333333333333
529470,5,6302969581,"This movie really surprised...a beautiful, well-constructed, well-thought-out, fantastically acted, subtle, insightful WINNER, one of the best films I've seen in a year!  It was a story about a teacher (who could be any person, man or woman) truly coming to terms with his own emotional deadness, and in so doing, coming back in touch with his true life force.  Through admitting his inner deadness to those he was entrusted to guide - his students - he affirms to them what they have felt and whispered about all along...and in so doing offers them a better chance to stay on the path of life...and step off the path that has been so ""soul crushing"".  In effect, he redeems himself as a true teacher by setting such a profound and beautiful example.
I loved this movie because it is the metaphor for the emotionally dead parent coming clean, and giving us, the wounded children, a new hope for life.  Of course, in reality it is rare that a parent comes clean as such, but that's okay, because as adults we can do it ourselves...and there are no lack of people who are in need of such an example.",999302400,2,1097,4.581632653061225

Redgrave plays an aging and  depressed schoolmaster at an English boarding school who, despite a  promising start as a teacher many years before, has now failed as a teacher  and as a husband.  His wife is a nightmare -- conniving, duplicitous and  unfaithful.  His tolerance of her maliciousness, and of his own failings,  is touchingly played out in one heartrending scene after another.  Into  this malaise comes a young student who, unlike his fellow students,  recognizes the brilliance and potential of the old schoolmaster.  When he  gives the old man the present of a book of poems by Browning, it reawakens  a long lost spirit.  If you see no other movie, see this one -- please.  You'll never forget it.

The direction is simple but effective, and the acting is brilliant throughout. The film is slow paced and all of its drama springs from the dialogue of its characters, so if you do not enjoy films of that sort you are not likely to enjoy this one.

I thought that the applause at the end of the film (I'll not provide context to spoil anything) was slightly overdone, but that was perhaps its only off-key moment.

529555,5,6302969581,"I have both the 1951 and the 1994 versions of ""The Browning Version"" and I recommend both of them. (There are a couple of TV versions which I have not seen.)
Overall I prefer the 1994 version, but the 1951 version has a couple of notable areas where it is better. The main one is the character of Mrs. Crocker-Harris. In the 1994 version Laura (as Mrs. Crocker-Harris is known in the 1994 version) is really to open with her feeling for Mr. Hunter. Everybody in the school would have had to know about the affair, it was almost obvious from the first scene they had together. In the 1951 version Millie (as Mrs. Crocker-Harris is known in the 1951 version) was more hateful and devious which I felt was more suitable for the character.
The other area where I felt the 1951 version was far better was the ending. I will be careful in the way I word this so as not to be a spoiler, but I found the ending of the 1951 version better in two main points. First, I felt the way things worked out between Mr. and Mrs. Crocker-Harris in the end of the 1951 version was better, although I can see why some people might prefer the 1994 version here. Secondly I felt the use of Mr. Crocker-Harris' translation of Agamemnon in the final scenes of the 1951 version was splendid.
The reasons I overall prefer the 1994 version are actually a lot of little things which I could not completely list even if I were not trying to avoid spoilers. But of the more notable reasons, first of all is the character of Andrew Crocker-Harris (the main character). There were advantages and disadvantages to both versions of Andrew, but I really preferred the 1994 version. I could see in this version that he was at one time probably a good teacher (although not necessary ever a great teacher), and despite the fact that he is currently only a shall of the man he probably once was, he is still respected by his peers although they perhaps also pity him, and he also has the respect of his former students who also clearly still fear him.
Secondly, I felt that the character of Taplow was far better in the 1994 version. It is not that I did not like Brian Smith's acting in the 1951 version, it is more the way the character is fleshed out in the 1994 version. I found this version of Taplow more likable, and more understandable.
A third point which helped the 1994 version was the extra scenes of the school life, instead of concentrating so much on Mr. and Mrs. Crocker-Harris. This also helped in fleshing out the character of Taplow.
One other notable thing. The 1951 version is not rated, the 1994 version is rated R. At the beginning of the 1994 movie it is stated that the R rating is ""for some language"". I did not count them, but I don't recall more than about a half dozen uses of profanity in the whole movie, plus a few more uses of words which although not profanity had sexual references. An R rating for this seems a but much. Even figuring in the brief shower scene where three boys (including Taplow) are seen fully nude from the rear I did not see how it would deserve an R rating, I would think it would be more of a PG-13. The 1951 version has neither the profanity, sexual language nor the nudity.",1402012800,,3194,4.378787878787879

529558,3,6302969581,"I saw this years ago, ran across it on Amazon streaming and still found Michael Redgrave's interpretation of a repressed and despised school master, who finally acknowledges his failures, deeply moving.

But I also found the subtext a bit disturbing since it focuses Aeschylus' Agamemnon, who was killed by his wife and her lover. However, before his return from the Trojan Wars, Agamemnon sacrificed his pure young daughter to the Gods so that he could embark on his overweening career ambitions and set sail for Troy.

 Andrew Crocker-Harris [Redgrave] , eighteen years prior to the opening of the narrative married a much younger, very pretty and vivacious woman. So when Crocker - Harris, in his characteristically clipped tones,  says to his wife's lover that he did her a disservice by marrying her and claims, 'I was woefully ignorant of the facts of life.'  I have to balk a bit. No classicist and no product of the English public school system of the era could possibly be that naive. Inexperienced with women, yes, unaware no. He makes his case further by stating he hoped that his wife, denied sexual satisfaction and emotional passion, would settle for his version of higher love, one that is purely Platonic.

Yes, sure, why not?  And so the Croc wins over the lover and sympathy of the audience. From this point it's all about the Croc and his recovery. Milly, the wife, depicted as an unfaithful, embittered, grasping, lowborn though aspirational shrew with a poisonous tongue is finally rejected both by her lover and her husband. In the one gesture of humanity granted her, she drops her brittle mask and holds out her hand beseechingly toward Crocker-Harris though he deliberately refuses to forgive or even register it --the way one senses he must have rejected her attempts many times before. Jean Kent, as Millie gives a stagy, old fashioned performance --Redgrave is so much better--and so she doesn't quite convey Milly's utter despair particularly well.

Rattigan and Asquith, much as I hate to bring it up, were both closeted homosexuals. Working under the social constraints of their era, they made a villain of the wife [a creature in a much worse position than her husband] and not the society which was so cruel to gay men - and in the end punished her terribly .  Yet for a woman to be that vindictive to her husband indicates that her pain was immense. Indifference would demonstrate she didn't give a damn about him.

I can't help but compare this to the work of Tennessee Williams, also gay, but whose women were brilliantly written--and no matter how neurotic, pushy, pathetic or narcissistic they were--they were lovingly and compassionately drawn. This doesn't mean that this isn't a fine film in all other respects, it is, and it is well worth seeing. Three and a half stars.",1389830400,4,2812,4.876310272536688

529621,5,6302969581,"Michael Redgrave's marvelously understated performance as Crocker-Harris in Anthony Asquith's masterpiece ""The Browning Version"" should be on any list of great performances in the films of England's post-war years. Asquith's adaptation of Terrence Rattigan's play brings to life the paradox of success in failure, a difficult theme that is handled with great subtletly in this Asquith-Redgrave partnership. We have the good fortune of seeing this inspired partnership repeat in ""The Importance of Being Ernest"" but this black and white film is the best representative of the sheer artistry of Asquith and Redgrave, and together they represent the best talent in British film during those extra-ordinary post-war decades from the 1940s to the 1960s.

The star of Michael Redgrave is at its brightest in his career. Redgrave's masterly understated film performance, his classic stoic approach to registering sentiment during crucial moments of the narrative make the emotions of the teacher he plays consistently affecting. The Crocker-Harris role is all about representing the decorum of the life of an old-school teacher. The veneer of control and discipline in this school teacher is often shown alongshide the massive emotional turmoil in Crocker-Harris's life. Redgrave is utterly convincing in portraying this dual dimension of the Crocker-Harris character. As a teacher wholly dedicated to the craft of classical education he is also devoted to the first principle of education, of molding the minds of the young. This classicist's philosophy of pedagogy is positioned to diminish the importance of molding the heart of the young. The Classicist is set against the Romanticist. Sentiment has to be subordinate to reason, especially reason that stems out of an old fashioned insistence on sternness and rules. Much of the splendor and frustrations of Crocker-Harris's endeavor as a classical teacher comes through as a philosophy that insistently resists the pull of the romanticist's worldview. His role of the teacher is utterly convincing; he may have drawn on his real life experiences as a school teacher, his first real job before he chose acting as the preferred mode of making a living.

Michael Redgrave as the stern schoolmaster convinced that the royal road to education lies in the sole task of disciplining his students in the old fashioned Spartan ideal of austere following of rules, is a skeptic of the claims of the heart. There is a coldness about Crocker-Harris's approach to teaching and we soon see how the interests of his students begin to wither away. We learn that there is a similar coldness in his personal life, his marriage to an estranged, much younger wife. We cannot help but make the connection between the emotionally impoverished marriage and a teaching career stunted by ineffective, outmoded, principles of teaching, which has consistently led to the impoverishment of the souls of his students. During many scenes in this film, his students seem to cry out to their teacher: ""our heart, teacher Crocker-Harris, our heart is as much in need for inspiration as the mind. They try hard to awake the strict disciplinarian to a more humane approach to education. We see the tragic flaw of this well-intentioned classicist and we dimly imagine a doomed future awaiting Crocker-Harris as a teacher.

One sympathetic student comes to Crocker-Harris's rescue. Taplow (Brian Smith), who accidentally discovers a copy of Crocker-Harris's treasured Browning translation of Aeschylus's ""Agamemnon"". He shows it to his instructor. The secret romantic soul of Crocker-Harris is thus revealed in his unsuspected special regard for the great Victorian, and late Romanticist, Robert Browning, and his emotional reaction to Taplow's kindness. Taplow has discovered the Browning translation of Aeschylus, and a big key to his teacher's heart, his real nature. To discover the Robert Browning version of the play as one of Crocker-Harris's treasured books is a major discovery of Crocker-Harris's secret character. Taplow takes this copy with him secretly when he is at his teacher's home for additional after-school translating classes, from the Greek to English, of Aeschylus's ""Agamemnon"".

Around this time we also learn that Crocker Harris's wife Millie is carrying out her intrigues with a popular teacher in the school, Frank Hunter, the science teacher of the lower-fifth. Knowing this additional fact of Crocker Harris's life shows that he is personally and professionally at the lowest ebb of his life. Even if he looks surprised, even shocked, as the school's headmaster gently requests Crocker-Harris for his resignation, we also see him move on with a determination and resolve to complete his obligations in the midst of all that failure. We begin to learn that Crocker-Harris may be on his way out, subtly forced out, by a Head Master (Wilfred Hyde-White) who has had enough of Crocker-Harris's old school ways.

Redgrave from here on portrays the role of a wounded but suddenly awakened teacher with touching depth. The unsympathetic teacher of the first one third of the film now begins to show a strangely noble glow as he begins to awaken to the reality of his erroneous assumptions about teaching. To Crocker-Harris's horror his philosophy of teaching may have hurt rather than molded the soul of his students. A formerly imperturbable soul awakens in the moment of his greatest failure to acknowledge his damaging legacy.

This sudden reversal forebodes well for Crocker-Harris's redemption. We see signs of it in the most unlikely turn of events. Even if Crocker-Harris is too old and set in his ways for a professional transformation in this late stage of his career he already begins to conduct himself in a remarkably dignified fashion, as a man, and a teacher, who knows when he is beaten and who has the courage to own up to his mistakes. There is in Crocker-Harris's stoic resignation a display of greatness, with its grayer colors of failure all over it.

Crocker-Harris has allies. The new incoming teacher Gilbert (Ronald Howard) who has come to replace Crocker-Harris reverentially admires Crocker-Harris's handling of discipline in the classroom as Gilbert is led to a round of orientation to teaching. Crocker-Harris's unresentful and generous hand in smoothly transitioning the job over to Gilbert wins him a friend rather than an enemy. Then there is Taplow, the only student sympathetic to Crocker-Harris despite his eccentric coolness and imperiousness towards his students. In another strange reversal, Frank Hunter, the science teacher who is having an affair with Millie, begins to look at Crocker-Harris as a deeply misunderstood human being.

A crucial scene of reversal in the film is when Taplow returns to present Crocker-Harris with the Browning Version of Aeschylus's greatest play ""Agamemnon"". Crocker-Harris opens the gift and thanks Taplow in an uncharacteristic show of sincere emotion. As ""one of Britain's greatest poets"" Browning's translation makes Crocker-Harris's day. Taplow's sympathy has a profound impact on Crocker-Harris when he most needs it. The giving spirit of Taplow has an influence that runs silent and deep and changes his life.

The scenes between Millie, Crocker-Harris, Frank, and Taplow are alternately cruel and inspiring. The film's dramatic crescendo in that unforgettable speech in the end of the film by Crocker-Harris is one of the great moments of film, a classic example of how fine art has its day in cinema. This is Michael Redgrave's high point in his acting career. He performs that final scene, with a speech that requires great dramatic timing and controlled emotional artistry that Redgrave acting genius amply provides. This speech  that is my candidate for one of the greatest emotional moments in cinema. I have seen the ending of this film so many times and each time I am even more sure that I love film so much. Crocker-Harris's speech has the wonderful idealism of Frank Galvin's speech in Sidney Lumet's ""The Verdict"", which despite its completely different setting and story is reprisal of the glorious idealistic artistic spirit of this Asquith film.

See this forgotten classic, Anthony Asquith's definitive 1951 version of The Browning Version. You will be reminded again of a beautiful age of British cinema at its peak from the 1930s through the 1950s. Asquith's film is a tribute to the best that British Film has to offer. While it does not have the visual splendor of the Powell -Pressburger films, its morally loftier theme makes this film one of the great cinematic treasures of World Cinema.",1359158400,,8623,5.264

529624,5,6302969581,"When I watched this  black and white  very English film made 60 years ago (1951), I was  not able to take my eyes off the screen and felt the close tears for  almost all 90 minutes. I never thought I'd feel so strongly for the quite unlikable, stuffy, and dry character, whom no one at the private school for boys where he taught classical languages, Latin and Greek, seemed to like at all, and who realized at the very last day of his employment that he had become a real failure - professionally, socially, and personally. In the beginning of his career, he started as a promising scholar, talented translator, and a charismatic man full of life and dreams, but he never fulfilled the promises.  If anybody had told me that I would be so engrossed in the life of such boring and unsympathetic (or so it seemed) man, who reminded two least likable characters from the Russian literature, another classical languages teacher Belikov, ""the man in case"" by A. P. Chekhov and Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, remote and emotionless man, unloved and deceived cuckold husband of Anna Karenina, I would not have believed them but Michael Redgrave performed a miracle.  His transforming into the character, becoming the character and bringing out the real Crocker-Harris was so convincing that his performance as Andrew Crocker-Harris, ""The Crock"", is without doubt, ""one of the greatest performances ever seen in films"" (as described by The Daily Mirror) and truly unforgettable. The praise was given to the Redgrave's performance 60 years ago but it is still true. Incomparable performance by Redgrave (and very good support from the rest of the cast), the simple and devastating story written by Terence Rattigan based on his own one act play and confident but unobtrusive directing of Anthony Asquith, made the film unforgettable for me. The Browning Version tells the story with deep sympathy to the main character while revealing his true nature gradually in the precise and subtle details. The only discordant note was the final scene following the Crocker-Harris' speech with the loud applause from the students. It was a little hard to believe in such enthusiasm and understanding from 15-16 year olds (they did not follow emotional journey of Crocker-Harris to self-discovery as we, the viewers, did), but Redgrave certainly deserved all possible applauds and long standing ovations from the audience for his performance.

Apart from a short interview with Michael Redgrave, and a slightly longer one with Mike Figgis, who helmed a contemporary remake of the film, the extra offerings are few.

This is the story of a teacher, and as I am a teacher--a tutor, at any rate-- the film has added resonance for me, but I do not think that its power depends on that accident. It is simply the story of a man performing that rarest of human miracles, rising morally above his own failure and disgrace by facing it and publicly embracing it. Not central to the drama, but notable, is the portrayal of the school's headmaster as a purely, and disgustingly, political creature. He stands for what I would like to believe is the worst that a public figure can be, except that I can think of few if any public figures who do not have much in common with him. Indeed, every character in the film, from the teacher himself, to his unfaithful wife, to her shallow lover, to the pupil who sees past the teacher's mask, is a moral education, a lesson, though in no way a preachy one, in what it takes to be a human being. One additional note: it is worth your while to do some research in order to understand the significance of the title, which on its face is quite obscure. It is an indirect reference to the literature of classical Greece, where all that truly matters seems to have been well understood long before our shoddy little civilization tramped onto the world stage. No, I do not say that the ancient Greeks were without vice, only that they were capable of understanding their own faults, as is the protagonist of this jewel-like film.",1261872000,3,1612,4.412751677852349

One scene in particular, in which one of his students (Brian Smith) gives him a small present, has always stayed with me.  So taken aback by this act of kindness, Crocker-Harris breaks down into tears, perhaps the first time he has done so in his adult life.

Anthony Asquith directed this sensitive filming of the Rattigan play, which won the the Best Actor and Best Screenplay awards at the Cannes Film Festival.

529683,5,6302969581,"First of all, bravo to Criterion for commissioning this sparkling release of Anthony Asquith's The Browning Version. Michael Redgrave's performance took this viewer by surprise. The film's title refers to Robert Browning's translation of the Greek tragedy Agamemnon. Mr. Redgrave plays Crocker-Harris, steely headmaster of an all boys school in England. As a classical language professor, Crocker-Harris is as brittle as dry bones. His students fear and loathe him. Privately, they call him ""Himmler of the Lower Fifth (the class he teaches)."" Crocker's ill reputation fits him tightly and also very well.

In fact, he's the private joke of the school. He's husband to a woman almost half his age. Her flagrant affair with Frank Hunter, a younger headmaster and a physics professor in the upper fifth, is another running joke throughout the school. Mr. Crocker's ill health forces him to retire from the school; however, due to his early retirement, the school won't grant him a pension. This blow hurts Crocker; however, he's humble and makes no fuss about his cruel fate. His younger wife scold him; he should have demanded his pension, after all, the school made an exception once before and granted a pension to an injured athlete. Quietly, Crocker's manhood bears his wife's insults.

One of his students, a sensitive boy named Taplow, shows a sincere interest in Crocker. Taplow's friendship softens Crocker. Little by little, Crocker opens up to the boy. A long time ago, Crocker wrote a relaxed, easy-to-read translation of the Agamemnon that deviated from Browning's strict translation of the Agamemnon. Crocker still has his manuscript; he allows Taplow to read it.

Conscience torments Frank Hunter; he is no longer interested in being Mrs. Crocker Harris's lover. In fact, he's going away from both the school and from her life. Frank clears his conscious by confronting Crocker Harris. But Crocker isn't surprised that Frank is seeing his wife--Crocker has always known about his wife's affair. By this time, Crocker is the film's ultimate victim: his wife's chasing after a younger stronger man, the school's discarding him for a younger master, and his health is failing. What more can go wrong for him? All Crocker has left is the friendship of a young boy; that and an old forgotten manuscript, his own version of the Agamemnon.

The Browning version is a sad, sad film that deserves multiple viewings. Anyone with half of a heart will feel this movie. Not enough can be said of Mr. Redgrave's vulnerable performance. It's like watching two films with one actor playing two characters at the same time. Like Agememnon, Regrave's character is murdered--though not physically, but spiritually--by a younger, cold-blooded, spoiled, and souless wife. The film weighs in at a light hour-and-a-half; however, the film's power demonstrates the value of quality over quantity. A truly great film.",1232323200,4,2905,5.187633262260128

The hero here is a failed classics teacher at a second rate public school who is held in contempt by the boys, the headmaster & his own wife.  Instead of GOODBYE MR CHIPS it's 'Sod off Mr Crock'.

529770,5,6302969581,"""The Browning Version"" is a movie I discovered at the library. It wasn't that the synopsis peaked my interest or anything, but I had nothing better to do and I got the movie for free...So I figured, why not? The movie is a classic and was so loved by Oscar nominated director Mike Figgis (Best Director, 'Leaving Las Vegas') that he remade it in 1994. The Browning Version is a film that some people will find dull, it's completely built on characters and dialogue. There's no action, no profanity, and no sex. The latter is implied at times though. Michael Redgrave (who I'd never heard of, but saw an interview with him that's on the DVD) plays Andrew Crocker-Harris, a teacher. Whom we only briefly see in the beginning of the film and don't meet until we find out that it's his last year teaching at the school. All of his students are overwhelmingly happy to hear the news. At a glance, Crocker-Harris is a mean, emotionless, man; All his students hate him. Only one, a young boy named Taplow (Brian Smith) feel sympathy for him. Getting a glimpse into his home life, we learn that his wife Millicent (Jean Kent) frequently and openly cheats on him. Nigel Patrick plays Frank Hunter, a science teacher having an affair with Millicent but growing to like The Crock.

The plot is simple, but features wonderful dialogue and astounding performances. Particularly that of Redgrave. I realized that his performance was great while watching the film, but after watching the interview I can see that it was pretty amazing. The man's characteristics and voice are completely different from Crocker-Harris; It deservedly won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Hopefully this movie will gain more notice from the fact it's in The Criterion Collection. If you stumble upon this movie, or even if you have to splurge a few bucks to rent it, it's a wonderful and intelligent movie. Redgrave's final speech at the end evokes the same reaction in us, that it does in his students.

GRADE: A-",1159574400,,1986,4.753623188405797
529771,5,6302969581,"At first glance, this is a reflective statement of a burnt out teacher at a crossroad. With no pension, a new job with only 8 months' pay, an unfaithful wife, minimal respect from his disinterested students, no friend, his life could not have been poorer. To add insult to injuries, his successor was young, enthusiastic and open-minded and his right to speak last at the end-of-term ceremony was forfeited.

Yet a glimmer of hope came from ones he least expected it - his colleague-cum-love rival and a fifth grade student. And the catalyst that brought the change was a small Greek-to-English translation poem book. He mustered the courage to admit the grave mistakes he had inflicted upon his students and himself, freeing himself of his guilt in the past and allowing him to embrace the future. The man-to-man talk with his colleague and the man-to-father talk with his inspiring student was both warm and touching.

There was no real villain in the movie. The most unsympathetic role was Mrs. Crocker. She was disloyal, discontented, inconsiderate, vicious, unhappy and had a razor-sharp tongue. In this love-hate marriage, it is fair to say that she was at her husband's throat and killing his soul as much as he did her. Thus Mr. Crocker should carry as much responsibility in his students' indifferences as Mrs. Crocker's! Yet Mrs. Crocker was not so lucky as to be given a break for a better future.

Redgrave's performance as Mr. Crocker Harris was impeccable. The icing sugar of the cake was the subtle performance of the Chemistry teacher, his successor, the young student and Mrs. Crocker. The backdrop of the idyllic, stately, solemn school campus and chapel of the high school; the afternoon tea following the cricket game all lent authenticity to the old English school culture that eptomised the life Mr. Crocker immersed in.

This is a movie for all teachers to reflect on, whether they be rookies, mid-life crisis veterans or soon to retire and respectable in profession. One's life is not futile unless one has completely given up on himself.",1149033600,2,2062,4.933717579250721
529772,5,6302969581,"Ill health and a general sense of failure attend the last few days on the job of British boy's school teacher Andrew Crocker-Harris (Michael Redgrave) in 1951's THE BROWNING VERSION.

 There's more to it than that, of course.  There's an evil and loathsome wife, Millie (Jean Kent,) for Crocker-Harris to disappoint and infuriate.  There's a co-worker, played by Nigel Patrick, whose sincere offer of friendship occurs hard on the heels of a gross betrayal.  There's a bright young lad, Taplow (Brian Smith,), who may be the `one in a million' student who cancels the quitclaim on failure.  And of course there's Aeschylus, the Greek dramatist, whose Agamemnon, translated by Browning, tells the tragic tale of a king poisoned by his wife.

 Okay, that's pretty elliptical, but I'm trying to not give anything away, even though I'm not sure the plot twists and resolutions are that terribly important here.  THE BROWNING VERSION is driven by character rather than plot - it's the study of a man who began his career with great promise, a Mr. Chips in-waiting, who we meet at a withering juncture near the end of the path.  When the movie joins him he's ending a phase, the vital phase, of his professional career, and his last few days are filled with culminating embarrassments and humiliations.

 Ceding the material its due, and it's due a lot, THE BROWNING VERSION begins and ends for me with Redgrave's restrained performance.  Crocker-Harris does not jump off the page as a terribly appealing character, and there's any number of ways an actor could botch it.  Redgrave gets under the skin, though, and finds the universal in this distant and aloof character.

 This being a Criterion release there are, of course, extras. There's an eight-minute archival interview with Redgrave from the late `50s.  Also included is an interview with director Mike Figgis, who speaks about the '51 original and also about his 1994 remake with Albert Finney.  I have to admit I somewhat dread watching the remake, although Finney is a fine actor and Figgis seems sensitive to the material.  What worries me is Figgis use of the term `open up' - as in `open up' Terence Rattigan's one-act play even more than the original did.  Granted, the '51 version at times feels a little enclosed, but never stagy.  In fact, the `closed' feeling, along with the older acting style Figgis mentions, give the movie an intimacy that a broader approach might destroy.  At times Redgrave may feel a little precise, but he's playing an introverted character.  This is a piece that is supposed to whisper and insinuate.  We are meant to be drawn into Crocker-Harris's despair, not observe him from a shouting distance.  Not having seen Figgis's version I can't, shouldn't, comment or complain about it, but the '51 version, directed by Anthony Asquith, is to my mind an ideal presentation.  I can't believe this one can be improved upon.

  The audio commentary is provided by film historian Bruce Eder, who does an admirable job of acquainting us with Rattigan, Asquith, and Redgrave.  Like most scholarly commentaries he points out the significance of events that one misses the first time through a movie.  Unfairly, very unfairly, I did find myself wishing he'd shut up, though.  Not because he was droning on or anything, but because I played the commentary during my second run through the movie and I wanted to hear what the actors were saying.  That doesn't happen to me often while watching with commentary track, and when it does it's usually a testament to the film being commented upon.  A wonderful movie, with a sterling, unforgettable performance by Michael Redgrave.",1138233600,16,3653,4.944170771756979
529773,4,6302969581,"We all try to lead a good life but along the way labels are placed upon us. Are we considered a 'good person', 'bad person', 'happy person', 'sad person'? People will remark we are cold and heartless or sweet and gentle. The kind of person that would never hurt a fly. Sometimes we are fully aware of what people think of us other times we have no clue what people truly feel about us. Anthony Asquith's ""The Browning Version"" does deal with this subject among other things.

 Andrew Crocker-Harris (Michael Redgrave) is about to leave the school he has worked at for many years this however does not seem to bother his students. They are glad he is leaving. They claim he is a cruel, heartless man who never offered his students a fair chance. Are they right? When we see Crocker-Harris teach his class he is stern but no worse than any teacher I ever had. But  in the course of the day Harris is learn much about himself, his students, his wife, his school and about life.

 In many ways ""The Browning Version"" reminds me of Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"". Both film are about a man who realize his life has not added up to what he thought. He has been in fact a failure. Lost dreams and hopes have crowded his life. There is no passion anymore. In Bergman's film though the only hope the main character has is his son. If his son would not follow in his footsteps then perhaps there is hope.

 ""The Browning Version"" is a quiet, subtle film that is very powerful. It could considered by many a ""slow movie"". But the imprint it left on me will last forever. It is a deep thoughtful study of who we are and how we've become this person. Many people may feel Michael Redgrave isn't doing much. You hear the same agrument against Bill Murray lately for the film ""Broken Flowers"", what people don't seem to realize is that is the character. They are doing something. They are in fact doing more with silence and reserve than most actors do with wild gestures.

 ""The Browning Version"" is one of the greatest movies I have seen. I love these kind of thoughtful examination about who we are and our place in the world and I realize they are not for everyone still I recommend as many people as possible make an effort to see this movie.

 Bottom-line: One of the greatest films ever made. A quite film that is admittedly slow but still powerful. Comparable to ""Wild Strawberries"".",1128988800,6,2382,4.478060046189376
529774,5,6302969581,"Anthony Asquith was a British filmmaker who specialized in cinematic adaptations of literature that included the likes of Pygmalion, The Importance of Being Earnest and most significantly the following plays of Terence Rattigan: While the Sun Shines, The Winslow Boy and The Browning Version. The collaboration between Asquith and Rattigan on The Browning Version resulted in a masterful, searing character study of a repressed individual plagued by a lifetime of regrets.

Crocker-Harris (Redgrave) is a humourless sort of person who is a deeply repressed individual. He is a man of regrets as we learn while he tutors a student by the name of Taplow (Smith). During a discussion about the mythic tale of Agamemnon a crack in the teacher's armour appears, if only for a moment, as he talks about how as a young man he began his own translation of the story but ultimately abandoned it. Taplow reappears later on to perform an unselfish act of kindness that finally pierces Crocker-Harris' defenses and reaches an emotional part of him that has long been dormant. It also triggers a change in him that will become more apparent at the film's climax.

At first, we feel no sympathy for Crocker-Harris but for his apparently long-suffering wife. Once we learn that she's been cheating on him, that because he is retiring early he has been denied his pension, and, to add insult to injury, he's told to make his farewell speech before a junior staff member who is also leaving the school (as opposed to after as befitting his tenure at the school), he becomes a much more sympathetic character. Michael Redgrave delivers a flawless performance as he gradually peels back the layers to reveal the inner life of this melancholy individual.

There is an interview with filmmaker Mike Figgis who directed the 1994 version with Albert Finney as Crocker-Harris. Figgis admires the brilliance of the film and how it represents a bygone era of filmmaking. He speaks quite eloquently about the movie and Rattigan's work in general.

Also included is an interview with actor Michael Redgrave that he did for a BBC TV program called Picture Parade in 1958. The actor talks about how he picks roles that he finds challenging and the difference between acting on the stage and on film.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by film historian Bruce Eder who touches upon the differences between the play and the film. He also examines Asquith's and Rattigan's respective careers and how these two men's lives intersected. Eder offers excellent observations and analysis of the film in this very informative track.",1123027200,5,2597,5.002314814814815
529775,5,6302969581,"Considered among the finest one act plays as well as stage-to-film adaptation, the 1951 drama THE BROWNING VERSION (Criterion) also won Michael Redgrave best actor at the Cannes Film Festival.

Terence Rattigan added about 20 minutes to the introductory set-up in the screen adaptation of his hit play about Andrew Crocker-Harris, an aging, strict, emotionless and hated classics professor at a private (aka British ""public"") school in southern England on his last day of teaching.

Redgrave's measured and subtle performance as Crocker-Harris is one of those rare embodiments of actor into character where the seams completely vanish.  Crocker-Harris -- disdainfully called ""The Crock"" by colleagues and students behind his back -- is a man of immense pride.  Once so full of scholarly promise, he resigns as man with no rapport or sympathy with his students or fellow man. Crocker-Harris and the school are a product of an era that is over.  A time when the classics were taught to emphasize stoicism, to produce men with ""stiff upper lips"" who would go out and administer England's colonies in India, Africa and elsewhere.

Now on his day of retirement, it is abundantly clear that Crocker-Harris has fallen out of time not only with his era but with himself. In ill health, his passionate, younger wife is having an affair with a colleague -- the good-looking, youthful, popular science teacher.

The film follows Crocker-Harris on his last school day, a day filled with much cruelty and ends with his unforgettable farewell speech in the school's chapel.

Moments of clear insight into a greater reality are rare in life and the movies.  The epiphany of Crocker-Harris -- one of atonement if not redemption -- is surprising, potent and authentic.  This beautifully restored black and white film is one of the greats.  Don't miss it.

The title, and perhaps the catalyst for Crocker-Harris' self-examination, comes from a student's unexpected, kindly gift of the Robert Browning translation of schylus' ""Agamemnon.""  Crocker-Harris once wrote a translation of the Greek play and has been trying, mostly in vain, to teach his young charges to read the original Greek. (In the play, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife and lover).

Extras include an informed commentary by Bruce Eder, an interview with director and fan Mike Figgis (who directed Albert Finney in a remake) and a short 1950s BBC archival conversation with Michael Redgrave.",1122595200,3,2439,5.157360406091371
529776,5,6302969581,"Enough praise has accrued over the years to Michael Redgrave's  performance as an embittered, ridiculed and unloved boys school teacher, forced to retire pensionless due to ill health, that more is unnecessary. Mike Feggis, who is interviewed on this DVD, directed Albert Finney in a respectable remake, but this original from the one-act play by Terrence Rattigan is the one to watch. Its performances, and not just by Redgrave, are textbook examples of the actor's art, and their impact is moving.

Two scenes are paramount. A student gives the teacher a departing gift, a version of a Greek play they both admire. The gesture suddenly reduces him to tears and self-examination. He comes to admit his failure as a husband, as a human being and, in a farewell speech to his students, he apologizes for his failure as a teacher. To his surprise, his remarks are met with warm applause, giving him some hope as he leaves for a lesser post at less pay, this time without his adulterous wife. No, this is not ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips.""

Director Anthony Asquith opens the play up just enough to transform it into cinema. Contrasting personalities and teaching methods deepen the script, which Rattigan himself adapted, replacing the play's exposition with action. Asquith also made ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" with Redgrave; in it the actor gives an excellent comic performance that nonetheless does not surpass his work in ""The Browning Version,"" for which he rightly won the 1952 Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival.",1122249600,3,1525,4.996062992125984

He reminded me at the time of Crocker-Harris. I was not a particularly good student, but I did my best for him.
