8764770,5,B01H5BOID6,"Around 510 BC, Tarquinius, son of the Etruscan king of Rome, raped the Roman aristocrat Lucretia. The rape, & Lucretia's honor-driven suicide, precipitated the rebellion that toppled the monarchy, launching the Roman Republic. So goes the legend, perhaps historically-based, recorded in much later Roman annals & subsequently re-interpreted in poetry, paintings, plays &, in 1946, Britten's first chamber opera, with 8 vocalists & only 13 instrumentalists.

This 2015 Glyndebourne production won rave reviews from the British press & no wonder! The singers are all vocally & dramatically terrific & the staging stark, powerful & moving. The imaginative staging by director Fiona Shaw & a set designer Michael Levine presents a military tent & archaeological site, darkly lit, in which the ancient events take place.

Shaw introduces 2 silent extras: Lucretia's young daughter & a warcamp slave-prostitute. Most surprisingly, she has the Male & Female Chorus, as modern archaeologists, not only comment about the action, but in time-warp fashion, actually get physically involved with it! I usually deplore such deviations but here, they respect the spirit of Ronald Duncan's libretto, while sustaining the very visceral dramatic impact.

Duncan's libretto provides the opera's only weakness, an epilogue sung by the Male & Female Chorus replete with Christian religiosity, quite extraneous to the tragedy that has just unfolded. Extras include commentary by director Shaw, a brief documentary about the opera's 1946 Glyndebourne premiere & a cast gallery.",1515888000,,1555,5.636752136752137

8764772,5,B01H5BOID6,"This new Opus Arte Blu-ray disc of last year's Glyndbourne production of Britten's The Rape of Lucretia is a very welcome record of the highly praised opera directed by Fiona Shaw. Shaw's concept adds new layers to the cleverly designed original concept of Britten and his librettist Ronald Duncan. There's an intended pun there, since the Male and Female Choruses act as if they were post-war British archaeologists uncovering the tragic story of Lucretia and her rape by Tarquinius, prince of Rome. We dig into the story through layers of dirt, and the set and lighting and costume design all focus our attention on Britten's perennial theme, the corruption of innocence.

I watched this with the equally sordid American election swirling in the background, which seemed pertinent in a way, but unfortunate in others. There's lots in the story as told by Shaw that's vile, but it also has dignity and gravitas, and the violence of the central act is never gratuitous. That's helped immensely by the amazing acting and singing of the cast, and especially Christine Rice as Lucretia and Duncan Rock as Tarquinius. Musically as well we have the best possible players - thirteen musicians from the London Philharmonic Orchestra and their leader, Leo Hussain - who, as Fiona Shaw herself says, ""have [the work] in their fingers, in their bodies."" The HD sound and picture are outstanding; much more impressive than a video clip can put across. This is a modern masterpiece brought to post-modern life.",1476662400,,1498,5.016064257028113
