Citizens of the Allied countries may forget how our enemy experienced the 2nd World War and this is a great flick to see it from the German side (remember Daz Boat?), 10 years after the war ended. The hero is disgusted with the Luffwaffen and their bumbling leadership. I don't want to reveal ending but although based on a play, this in no way detracts from the film. Actually, it enhances it. It seems too many people these days want nothing more from a film than explosions and car chases and they have forgetten what real acting and drama is all about. This film also won an award for best female suppoting actress in 1955. I give it 4 stars. Enjoy it and let it be the thought-provoking presentation it actually is.",1259020800,2,751,4.449275362318841
7983744,3,B00008GKH4,"The minute I saw in the credits that this film is based on a play, I knew I was in for a talkfest. Another drawback is that this video version is dubbed and Curt Jurgen's voice is a real disappointment since we know what he really sounded like. Otherwise it's a dirty nazis vs. noble soldier story - kind of like ""The Desert Fox"". Don't waste your time with it.",1247184000,3,361,4.171428571428572
7983745,5,B00008GKH4,"There's no way for me to tell you whether you'll like this movie.  It's unusual in that it was made in Germany shortly after WWII and depicts officers that are unhappy with the WWII era government.  The DVD came quickly, was well packaged, and worked perfectly.",1244678400,4,261,4.6521739130434785
7983746,4,B00008GKH4,"The real Ernst Udet was absolutely out of his depth after being named as head of the Office of Air Armament in 1939.  The 26 separate offices under his direct command were staffed by over 4,000 Luftwaffe officers. Udet, who was the highest ranking WWI ace, became a stunt pilot after the war.  He had no technical background whatever.  He was promoted as a friend of Goering. His production figures and projections were false.  He did not know what was going on in the Office of Air Armament.  He was a drug addict and a heavy drinker.  On the 17th of November 1941 he shot himself.
While the film is pure propaganda fiction I recommend it.  Curt Jurgens, who was sent to a concentration camp by Goebbels, is an outstanding actor playing the fictional Colonel-General Udet.  The support cast is also superb.  BUY THIS FILM!",1203724800,7,823,4.620689655172414
7983747,5,B00008GKH4,"I first saw Des Teufels General in the late '50's, as a German class assignment.  I have wanted my own copy ever since.  Zuckmayer is one of the premiere German playwrights and chose one of the finest German-language actors of the times as his protagonist, an actor imprisoned by the Nazis for his anti-Hitler stand -- but fortunately not killed.  The German-language version is the one I want, and I'm still looking.  Meanwhile, I'll watch the dubbed version with the German-language script in hand ... which I had to go to London to find!",1078790400,,540,4.712765957446808
