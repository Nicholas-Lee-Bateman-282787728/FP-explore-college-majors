unfortunaley there are a lot of graphic violent scenes because they are using footage used to document enemy fighting and was hard to watch. so scary i turned my head and closed my eyes. i honestly did not expect it. and did not know this was a docu. but there are hollywood scenes and acting scenes so it is still nice and would recommend sharing with your children so long as you understand there are graphic scenes but it is still VERY educational",1457395200,4,785,4.383561643835616
7800835,5,1880957191,A good classic filmed during that time in history.  I found it very informative and it reminded me of my father's time in the Army during World War II.,1358035200,,151,4.206896551724138
