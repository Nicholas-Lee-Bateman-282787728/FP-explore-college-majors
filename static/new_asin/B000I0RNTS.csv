This time a group of high school teens follow their school star skiers to a resort for a big ski competition.  The girls want to party and the boys want to get some.  We focus on two teen boys who are dismayed to end up rooming with their high school biology teacher, Roy Baliban played by Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In regular - Alan Sues.  I loved Alan Sues, who literally stole the show portraying this totally square & somewhat effeminate persona.  There is a scene with him in a Raiders of the Lost Arc reinactment which is hilarious and also dates this picture.  This movie also stars Mary Beth McDonough who played Erin in the Waltons series...she seems a bit old to be a love interest in this movie.  Billie Hayes also is in this picture and is a crazy woman who hangs out at the resort talking about being abducted by aliens from the planet pluto.  Billie Hayes played the Jeannie from the Sid & Marty Krofft Lidsville series.  There are a few funny ski scenes that are almost a frame for frame repeat from the Disney movie Snowball Express but all in all a fun film to watch.  Even though this is portrayed as a sex movie, it is very tame.  there was one glimpse of [...] and that was it.  Hope this helps.",1167264000,9,1384,4.301158301158301
