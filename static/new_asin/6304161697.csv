7863573,5,6304161697,"We can't all afford to travel the world after reading ""The Sign and the Seal"" by Gramham Hancock.  But we can buy this important video!  I'll never be able to travel to places to see these things myself so this  IS the best way to go ... Being a member of the Knights Templar through a  local Masonic organization - I can tell you that this book & video  really brings loose ends together.  I would invite others to follow my  ""Quest"" for TRUTH.  It is a very interesting and enlightening  journey and one where every man will find direction.  May God bless thee.
