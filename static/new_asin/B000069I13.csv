7965926,1,B000069I13,"Having watched thousands of movies, many multiple times, this has the onerous distinction of being the most outrageously bad one (tied wit this Edgar Allan Poe inspired piece of dung called 'The Raven'--if I remember correctly).  The title, of course, is taken from one my favorite movies, 'Taxi Driver' and the director does his best to rip of the movie and lead character Travis Bickel (played, of course, by Robert Dinero).  Imitation, in this case, is not the best form of flattery because this movie, and everything about it, just sucks eggs.  Everything about is an hilariously bad derivation from 'Taxi Driver'.  It was so bad it was actually funny once I got past the initial disgust and nausea.  Aspiring film makers could, perhaps, use this a textbook example of how not to make a film.",1405987200,,796,4.823529411764706
7965927,5,B000069I13,"Comparisons with Travis Bickel from Taxi Driver are almost inevitable.  However, this character is more self aware, volatile, and ultimately responsible for the downward spiral his life has taken. The people around him also live on the darkest side of humanity. He eats second chances like candy and throws sensible advice out the window.  If you enjoy gritty and unpredictable character studies, this is one of the best.",1404345600,,421,5.176470588235294
7965928,3,B000069I13,"""God's Lonely Man"" is a classic, low budget ""Taxi Driver"" ripoff, that includes the main guy who looks, dresses and acts just like De Niro, but not quite as well of course.
Director Frank Von Zerneck Jr, has definately seen ""Taxi Driver""a number of times, and good on him. So have I. He obviously loved it so much, he copied it and added a few scenes of his own. In particular, a disturbing little scene that includes a cameo by one of my favourite actors Tom Towles, (who played Otis Toole in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"") again playing another twisted, sleazy scumbag.
Cheap and nasty, and all the better for it. Magic stuff!!!",1185494400,,637,4.547826086956522
7965929,5,B000069I13,"Amazing performance by Michael Wyle drives GOD'S LONELY MAN, a gritty and intense powder keg of a film that plays like an updated west coast version of  Taxi Driver, its most obvious influence. Indeed some may dismiss the film as nothing more than a pastiche but I strongly disagree; the central performance by Michael Wyle is reason enough to see this film--he has the uncanny ability to go from Deniro-like intensity to almost Woody-Allen style neurosis in an eye blink; it's a live-wire performance that I found very compelling and his tortured-loser persona had me rooting for him from the first reel to the end credits.

Paul Dooly shows  courage for taking the part of a  sleazy child pornographer and Tom Towles proves he can do more to suggest hidden depths of depravity in one scene than most actors can in an entire film.

The writing is good, the characterizations dead-on and there are some genuinely unsettling scenes that set a tone for modern day LA that is every bit as decayed and frightening as anything seen in the New York of TAXI DRIVER or BRINGING OUT THE DEAD: Sirens scream off-screen at unexpected times accompanied by children crying. Crack-dealers abuse their customers in creepy passive-aggressive power games. A scene set in a sun-drenched ball-park where a child pornographer peddles his wares (right during the little league game he is coaching!)  carries a slimy, unsettling edge that reminded me of the fiction of Andrew Vachss in the depiction of evil lurking just under the surface of wholesome everyday appearances.",1161907200,,1551,4.969111969111969
7965930,4,B000069I13,"GOD'S LONELY MAN is amazingly, inspired by a true story. Ernest  (Michael Wyle) is a strange, naive man who works in a porno shop (his mother thinks he is a cop) but winds up losing his job. His insecurities see him using coke and speed to help him cope with his sense of isolation. Ernest feels as though he is cursed, has suicidal thoughts and in one manic moment in the film, slices off his pinky. But despite all his problems Ernest is basically a good man and he befriends a teenage girl, Christiane (Heather McComb) who is being degraded by pornographers (a kind of homage to the movie CHRISTIANE F.?) She is also an alcoholic and Ernest offers to attend her counselling sessions with her. But he is slowly plotting to take  revenge on the kiddie porn/ snuff film makers who who have exploited Christiane. The revenge sequence is justifiably bloody and graphic, but the film handles its difficult subject matter sensitively and only features graphic violence near the climax. Former porn star Ginger Lynn Allen has a cameo as a member of an AA group.",1035676800,,1056,4.641711229946524
