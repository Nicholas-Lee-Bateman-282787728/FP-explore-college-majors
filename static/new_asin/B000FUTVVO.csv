2590376,4,B000FUTVVO,"Jennie Garth, Tim Matheson, Leigh Taylor-Young. After the wife of a married professor goes into complete remission from cancer, he tries to break off his affair with one of his students. But she can't and refuses to accept that it's over and plots to ruin his life.",1391040000,,265,4.659574468085107
2590392,4,B000FUTVVO,"A very good movie and the price was right!  Not a fan of Jennie Garth, but she was tolerable in this flick.",1383868800,,107,3.8636363636363638
2590393,5,B000FUTVVO,"I've seen this movie on lifetime... I really enjoyed this film, but never saw the beginning of this movie ... It surprised me at the beginning of the credits that Jennie Garth co-produced the film. I wonder is this the only film she's co-produced or are there others ones? ... I do think she is a beautiful good actress. I wish though, that the time she was seducing the son that there would have been more scenes where she's being more manipulative whether to the son or the rest of the family before it leads to the finale. I did like the last scene but, I do think the very ending could have been a lot better.
I kind of wish she would have gotten away with it all, I think that would have made the whole movie more intriguing.

Nevertheless, its a movie i will watch over and over again ... If anyone enjoyed this movie then I really think ya'll will enjoy DREAM LOVER starring James Spader and Madchen Ammick ,... Very good movie with two very talented beautiful actors in this film... their performances are amazing in this film is outstanding, their chemistry is great... and Madchen is amazing at acting as the seductive, very manipulative, calculating character in the film.... This by the way is another film in which I think it would have been great  if  ** SPOILER ALERT** ... Lena (madchen's character) had not gotten away with it all .... But yet again if you see this film, you may feel way more sympathetic for (spaders character) which I did, so I also do like the way the movie ends in this dreamlike scene...",1371686400,3,1527,4.446428571428571
2590394,5,B000FUTVVO,Wow!  Sometimes things can be blown out of proportion and bad things happen.  Very good movie!  Gotta be more careful what you like and get tempted with.,1370390400,,153,4.592592592592593
2590395,1,B000FUTVVO,"This movie just never picks up! I was looking at it and waiting for it to get interesting but it never did.  Matheson seems to just be a picture on the wall in this movie.  Jenny Garth is still beautiful and talented, but she wasted her time with this flick.  If you have nothing to do and want kill about 2 hours of your time... this is the movie for you.",1291334400,3,356,3.9859154929577465
2590396,5,B000FUTVVO,This is a thriller.  I love thrillers.  The kind that keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.  Once again Tim Matheson is great in this role.  Watch this one with your boyfriend or hubby.  You may look at each other differently.  Ha!,1280707200,11,244,4.085106382978723
2590397,4,B000FUTVVO,Great movie! Jennie Garth was wonderful in this movie. She should have been in more movies. This was a sleeper and is a should be seen movie.,1255478400,,141,4.2592592592592595
2590398,5,B000FUTVVO,This is a great movie nad it is very interesting and the story line is good,1252713600,4,75,3.75
2590399,1,B000FUTVVO,"I only bought this movie because it's the one where real-life sweethearts Peter Facinelli & Jennie Garth meet (and later get married), and it ended up being pretty lame. The acting was mediocre at best, and the dialog was very heavy handed. Jennie Garth did a horrible job trying to be seductive, alluring, or anything but annoying. I'm quite sure that I won't be recommending this movie to anyone, ever. Unless they just want to see a Peter Facinelli movie, but honestly he's so young in it, he's not even hot yet.",1243814400,2,515,4.608695652173913
2590400,5,B000FUTVVO,I took a chance when I purchased this movie and found out it was very good.  It was unpredictable and definitely kept my interest.,1231286400,8,130,4.416666666666667
