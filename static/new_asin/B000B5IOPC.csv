2400250,5,B000B5IOPC,"I just finished with this series, and wanted to share my thoughts since there is only one other review.  I picked up this little gem on a whim and I was blown away with the series.  I'm a big Rurouni Kenshin fan, and it's been tough looking for a series to compare.  There are plenty of lovable characters in Peacemaker, as well as some good plot.  The action is more towards the end of the set, but I had to watch the last two discs without stopping.  There is some seriously good sequences, and cliff hangers...should you only have one disc.  I probably would have ordered the last disc with overnight shipping, had I not bought the set.  It's that good.  All in all, I thought the storylines were tied up nicely.  I'm glad to see a series that was thought through from the beginning and not rushed to a finale once the budget was cut.  Enjoy!",1137974400,2,845,4.32484076433121
2400251,4,B000B5IOPC,"Okay, the price on this is really reasonable, but watch out! There are _no_ extras here. Normally I wouldn't care because I generally just want to watch the anime episodes themselves, but I _really_ liked the short, narrated stories that came as extras with the other DVDs (especially the narrations by Hijikata, Okita, and the trio of jokers). So, be warned!

This version has both the Japanese voices with English subtitles and the English voices.

The anime series itself is wonderful, and it's definitely slashable, if you're so inclined.",1132531200,19,542,5.078651685393258

8081570,5,B000B5IOPC,"Though it hits a really dry spot in the middle of the series it picks back up right at the end, and more than makes up for the lost time.",1295395200,,137,3.6
8081571,5,B000B5IOPC,This story was great!  I laughed.  I cried.  I hated and loved the bad guy.  Sumumu has to be my favortie character next Okita. I have actually watched the whole this twice.,1199664000,,173,4.3125
8081572,4,B000B5IOPC,"A large number of anime fans are familiar with Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X, a fictionalized account of the Meiji Revolution from the Loyalist point of view.  In Peacemaker Kurogane, we get essentially the same story, only this time from the point of view of the Pro-Tokugawa forces - in particular the Shinsengumi guard, several of whom were supporting characters in the Kenshin franchise - and this rather underated historical actioner is an excellent companion piece to it's more famous counterpart.

It follows the story of the real-life Tetsunosuke Ichimora, age 15.  After the brutal murder of his parents at the hands of Loyalists, Tetsu vows to join the Shinsengumi over the objections of his frantic big brother Tatsunosuke.  His life becomes entwined with that of other characters both real and fictional, most notably becoming page to the strict Vice Commander Toshizo Hijikata - who doubts Tetsu will have what it takes when the time for battle arrives; and taken under the wing by painfully young Captain Soji Okita, historically documented to have loved children - who is already beginning to show signs of the Tuberculosis which would eventually kill him and perhaps sensing that he doesn't have much time before becoming incapacitated tries to help Tetsu maintain the moral and spiritual innocence that he himself can never get back.

Can Tetsu find his place in the world and strike a balance between Tatsu's potentially emotionally cripling overprotectiveness and the weight on his soul that joining the fight against the Loyalists might entail?  Will vengeance rule his heart, or will he become a peacemaker as his parents would have wanted him to be?

An anime that any fan of historical fiction should enjoy.",1182556800,2,1726,5.120996441281139
8081573,5,B000B5IOPC,"If Rurouni Kenshin left you wanting more feudal-era themed anime, then Peacemaker just might scratch that itch.  It's got a good plot, memorable characters, and was beautifully animated by Gonzo.  You can't go wrong with the animation studio that also worked on Last Exile, Chrono Crusade, and Samurai 7, among others.",1162512000,4,318,5.215686274509804
8081574,5,B000B5IOPC,"I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in martial arts anime, the Shinsengumi, and those who like their anime with a touch of humor like this show Peacemaker has some few comedic moments but it can be series. Saizo the pig does not actually talk.",1150416000,,265,4.659574468085107
8081575,4,B000B5IOPC,"I love Rurouni Kenshin I guess I'm a sucker for samuray series even if I close my eyes in the bloody scene, The peacemaker was not what I expected, It was better!! any way if you like more comedy give it try, and if you don't want to keep it you can always sell it. And the reason I gave 4 star is because I don't like bloody scene not because wasn't good.",1142899200,5,356,3.8904109589041096
8081576,5,B000B5IOPC,"I imported the Peacemaker DVD set The Perfect Collection still factory sealed. It has all 24 episodes and the extras found on the individual volumes all on only 3 DVDs. I forget if it only offers Japanese and English as audio languages, but it also has Chinese available for subtitles.

I am not a fan of blood and gore in the least, so I was surprised that not only did I enjoy the fight scenes, but felt there weren't enough of them! The action scenes are very well done, in the few episodes that they appear in.

There isn't much nudity. Mostly you can see the chests of certain guys (like Harada). There are scenes with another man naked and it scans up his body from the pelvic area/hip bones to his face, no genitals. Later you see the same guy sitting in his underwear. As for females, there is cleavage and and half covered breasts in ONE episode. So don't expect a parade of half naked people anywhere in this anime.

I'm the type of person to like Sailor Moon, Pom Poko, Spirited Away, etc. But I simply love Peacemaker! If you don't like watching anime subbed, but hate how bad the translations usually are in the dubbed versions, you don't have to worry with Peacemaker. The dubbed translations are very close to the subtitled translations (if only Sailor Moon was like that!).",1141344000,11,1289,4.5
