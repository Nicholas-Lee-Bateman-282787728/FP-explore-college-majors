8323189,5,B001N4K6L0,"Although this film was originally released years ago, its relevance today is profound. The H-2 program has expanded to over 200,000 workers in the US annually.  This documentary clarifies why employees would prefer to have workers who have no legal rights to be here unless employed by that employee.  Its well edited, well shot and has a great soundtrack.",1522540800,,356,5.016949152542373

8323191,5,B001N4K6L0,"This movie meant a lot to me because my father left on a farm work program during the same time that this documentary  was made,  to cut cane in Flordia.  He never returned ,  and no one knows what happen to him. So I was doing some research  and came up on this movie.  I am very happy I got see what he might have went through, when he use to return with boxes of food and pretty clothes.  I have more of a respect for all the men and woman who leave Jamaica to work overseas to feed their family.",1462147200,,499,3.881188118811881
8323192,5,B001N4K6L0,Every bit as good as Harvest Of Shame and a real eye opener to the fact that the conditions that existed at the time Harvest Of Shame was filmed have not really changed that much.,1263686400,,179,4.142857142857143
8323193,5,B001N4K6L0,"In 1992, a class suit found five sugar cane companies guilty of cheating more than 10,000[many countless more, but no written proof] cane workers of their contracted minimum wages during two seasons DOCUMENTED IN THIS FILM.
 $51,000,000.00 dollars in back pay was rewarded to the Caribbean workers.
 This was reversed by the Florida Appellate Court[a subsidary of the Florida Cane Industry] finding the H-2 contract ""ambigious""[favored workers].
 Once these lawsuits and public scrutiny mandated fair wages for workers, sugar cane companies switched to mechanical harvesting.
 Today, all surger cane in Florida is harvested by machine, however, the number of H-2 workers coming into the U.S. has substantially incresed.
 The pay has decreased, howerver, to ""slave wages"". Slaves long ago actually lived on their work. Slavery then ended when it became cheaper to pay ""slave wages""[industrial revolution] then to house & feed them as before.
 Despite a ""cap"" of 66,00 H-2B workers over 254,000 H-2B workers were certified[some are above the law]for employment by the Dept. of labor.
 The H-2A program, which covers agriculture, HAS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF WORKERS.
 An underground market for ""slave wages"" was created with the temporary work visas issued essentially ""free"" by the U.S. Govt.
 There are now ""labor brokers"" that apply as employers to import ""slave wage"" workers, then shop them around from industry to industry. So now, the ""industry"", will no longer be the ones ""officially"" unaccountable to the workers, it will be the unaccountable ""labor brokers"". When it comes time to pay they... ""disappear""... to shop around for more... ""worker fodder"".

 This DVD is anexcellent account of today's ""precarious worker class"" in a unregulated globalized casino capitalism that has usurped global, national, & local political capital..

 (PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO WATCH THE EXTRA 19 minute ubdate.)

 THIS IS AN OPENER!
 DON'T MISS IT!

 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!",1260576000,4,1967,5.372549019607843
8323194,5,B001N4K6L0,"A great film documenting the everyday lives of the annual Jamaican ""guest-workers"" who have come over to work cutting sugar cane in Florida.  10,000 men are brought in every year to spend six brutal months cutting sugar cane around the Lake Okeechobee area. The film shows the exploitation of the Jamaican workers who get paid pennies for their work. It shows the terrible working conditions, long hours, inadequate accomodation and the total injustice to the workers who seem to be stuck in a never ending cycle of pain and humiliation just to survive.
The workers struggle to get proper medical treatment for onsite injuries which are a regular thing when working with machete's all day long.

This documentary does a great job in exposing this inhumane treatment of the Jamaican sugar cane workers which has been a secret for so long.
'H-2 Worker' named after the H-2 guest-worker Visa's they must obtain is a great film well worth watching this one.",1246320000,,953,4.913043478260869
8323195,5,B001N4K6L0,"H2 Worker is a powerful documentary about sugar cane harvesting in Florida, America's flawed and abusive guest worker program and the Jamaican laborers it exploits who come every season hoping to make enough money to provide for their wives, children and families. This is an artfully crafted film, beautifully shot and fluidly edited. Very few films - documentary or narrative - use music so well. Now that H2 Worker is available on DVD you shouldn't pass up the chance to see it.",1241654400,2,481,4.878048780487805
