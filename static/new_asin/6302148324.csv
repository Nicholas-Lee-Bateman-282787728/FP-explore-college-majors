It's a silly, lighthearted flick about a lion who can't hunt because of double vision, his encounter with the local veterinarian, and his animal loving daughter. Corny and nostalgic, this is a film you can watch with anyone! It is a hoot. It's funny to see the old VHS technology and really appreciate how far we've come from there too. All live action, no CGI, it's one for the history books for sure.

But not only Clarence lives on the wildlife preserve. Judy the chimp causes all kinds of trouble and laughter. During this, a woman who has been studying gorillas for the past several months is stalked by some dangerous poachers that want to kill the gorillas.

Now it is up to Dr. Tracy, Clarence, and Judy the chimp to the rescue! This movie is full of laughs and adventure that is sure to entertain people of all ages. But it is ashame that this movie along with the continuing series Daktari have yet to be released onto DVD.

But, if you are looking for a great movie, then Clarence The Cross-Eyed Lion is the movie for you. So, what are you waiting for? Buy this classic movie and enjoy it again and again.",1231113600,,971,4.443820224719101
