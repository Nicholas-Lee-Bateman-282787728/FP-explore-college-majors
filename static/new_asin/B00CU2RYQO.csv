8586294,5,B00CU2RYQO,"excellent movie but this version is hard to get the settings done such as making it speak English instead of German and when I did get the English turned on the display stayed on the left of the screen the whole time,. the action is truly very good., but on the extra stuff I couldn't get sound on it, maybe it was me. I tried contacting the seller but heard nothing . I have been having trouble with my email so maybe they did and I just didn't catch it. very good movie though and blu ray enhances it, I HAVE TO REVISE MY REVIEW I DID GET IT WORKING AND NOTHING ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THEY DID CONTACT ME. USUALLY WHEN THEIRS OPERATOR DIFFICULTY ME BEING THE OPERATOR IT TAKES ME SOME TIME BUT IN MY DEFENSE THIS TIME I JUST GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE .IT REALLY IS USUALLY ME THAT DOES THINGS WRONG. THIS TRULY A WONDERFUL MOVIE AND PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH AND WATCH ONE OF MY FAVORITE MUSKETEER MOVIES. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY GOT IT ON BLU RAY I HAVE THE DVD BUT BLU RAY IS AWESOME! THEIRS NO COMPARISON TO IT! THANK YOU
