2807509,5,B000P296AS,"WOW, they are finally going to release the original Popeye cartoons!!! This is a dream come true!! Many people do not know the awsome beginnings of the Popeye cartoon series animated by the Max Fleischer Studios, but these are some of the finest examples of animation ever made!! I know, some of you will say ""Popeye  -- classic animation??, I don't think so"", but these are only the people that do not know the original Black & White Popeye cartoons made by Fleischer Studios. To compare the Max Fleischer Popeye cartoons to the Famous Studios Popeye cartoons is like comparing Disney's ""Snow White"" to Disney's made for TV animation. Even if you have seen the ""colorized"" versions of the original Popeye cartoons, you have missed an awful lot, since the colorized versions were hastily re-traced with simplified backgrounds inserted. Max Fleischer actually patented a method of using 3D models as backgrounds that moved in perspective as the characters moved. The results are nothing short of spectacular!! This technique was used around a dozen times in the original Popeye cartoon series, but all of them were cut out in the colorized versions (except for the 2 longer Popeye cartoons that were originally made in color). Also the Popeye character is soooo much funnier and less pitiful in the original series with Popeye always staying in his true character and muttering something highly irreverent under his breath. There have only been a handfull of these original cartoons available in the ""Public Domain"" for many years, and have been put into about a zillion different combinations, BUT THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!!! This is a real treat for true animation fans, and a must have for true Popeye fans.",1182384000,14,1707,4.968531468531468
2807510,5,B000P296AS,"The release of the original Fleischer ""Popeye"" cartoons on DVD is great news for animation fans! Perhaps this will lead to the official release of the Flesicher ""Betty Boop"" series.",1181174400,7,181,5.066666666666666
2807511,5,B000P296AS,I cant tell you how happy I am that this is FINALLY being released. Say goodbye VHS copies from the Cartoon Network! Yee Ha!,1179964800,6,124,4.208333333333333
2807512,5,B000P296AS,"The original Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons were groundbreaking.  The animation had a near 3-D look to them as the backgrounds were amazingly detailed and shaded.  For the Popeye animated shorts Max and Dave Fleischer created a great urban world for Popeye to live in (although they did occasionally change the locales depending on story needs).  There was a reality to the concrete jungle that was seen onscreen.

Then there were the voice actors, the most recognizable being Jack Mercer as Popeye (he took over the role in 1935) and Gus Wickie as Bluto (who also took over that role in 1935).  Both of these voice actors left such an indelible mark on the series that whenever a viewer watches one of the shorts made before they took over their roles (or after Wickie's death in 1938) it just doesn't sound, ""right.""  Wickie's deep voice, in particular, was so unique to the role that the Fleischers didn't even try to replace him with a ""sound-alike,"" but rather went in a different direction.

Included in this set are many of the best Popeye cartoons (but by no means all of the best - there were many great animated shorts to come!), including, ""The Paneless Window Washer,"" ""Let's Get Movin,"" ""Lost and Foundry,"" and, of course, the classic color Popeye, ""Epic,"" ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor!""

Warner Brothers has restored these animated works of art back to their original glory.  It is said that the picture quality on these cartoons will result in, ""Shock and awe,"" as these shorts haven't been seen in this good condition since they were first shown.

This is clearly the set that Popeye enthusiasts have been waiting for.  The best news is that it is but the first in a series of releases from Warner Brothers which will eventually include ALL of the classic Popeye cartoons!  Way to go Warners!

-Update: This set is even better than expected.  The extra features are very good and the shorts themselves look fantastic.  One of the best DVD releases of 2007.",1179792000,74,1990,4.777777777777778

2807514,5,B000P296AS,"As a lifelong fan of classic animation, I simply could not be more THRILLED at the prospect of finally owning restored versions of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons.  Other reviewers have expertly detailed the contents of this set, so I'd like to take a moment to try and convince/convert those folks who may not know and love these things as much as I do. . .

There has been, as long as I can recall, a misconception about Popeye cartoons.  I recently had this discussion with a good friend, who could not understand why I was so excited about this release.  She, like so many people, was raised on the color Popeye cartoons made in the 1960's.  ""They're all the same,"" she complained.  ""Popeye and Bluto fight over Olive Oyl, and Popeye eats spinach and beats up his rival.  Big deal.""  And you know something?  Based solely on the cartoons my friend had seen, she was right.  She knew nothing of these original black & white gems made by the Fleischers beginning in the early 1930's.  And while the voice of Popeye in most of those shorts is the same (Jack Mercer) as the later ones, that's where the similarities end.  The early 'toons are full of creative gags, ad-libs and boundless energy.  Plus, they have the inimitable Fleischer style, which can also be found in Betty Boop and, later, the first Superman cartoons.

I hope that those of you who only know Popeye from the later, bland incarnations will check out this set.  Forget Poopdeck Pappy or Popeye's nephews (those these will eventually surface in the Fleischer versions); this is the REAL POPEYE in all his elastic, mumbling glory.

Essential viewing for Popeye enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the early history of animated sound cartoons.

P.S. I wish I could get back all the money I've blown on cheapskate VHS and DVD versions by Goodtimes, etc.  Those things are headed for a garage sale faster than you can say ""I yam what I yam!""",1177718400,160,1906,4.655688622754491

2807516,5,B000P296AS,"This is it, Popeye cartoon fans! We have dreamed about it, wished for it, and hoped for it. Warner Brothers Video, by arrangement with King Features Syndicate, is issuing here the first 60 ORIGINAL Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons. Wonderful! These fantastic cartoons are being released in chronological order of their theatrical release, FULLY RESTORED from the original negatives in beautiful black and white, UNCUT, with all Paramount titles restored. Volume 1, 1933-1938, is a 4-disc collector's edition. Also included in this release are the first two Three-Color-Technicolor two-reel specials: ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor"", and ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves"". If that isn't enough, 5 hours worth of bonus materials are included: Audio commentaries from Mark Kausler, Jerry Beck, Mark Evanier, and others. More features include restrospectives on Popeye and Max Fleischer, behind the toons featurettes, and bonus shorts.

So many of us remember seeing many of these vintage Popeye shorts when we were kids, and fondly remember the incredible animation from those early Fleischer Studios Popeye's. In 1933, the original Popeye voice was done by William Costello. Sometime in 1935 he was fired and The Sailor Man's voice was taken over by Jack Mercer, who kept at it for the remaining duration of these great cartoons. Remember that wonderful muttering in those early years by Popeye? That was the great Jack Mercer. Who could forget that fantastic ""Is that so?"" and all the other regular mutterings that Popeye would utter, more so especially during the Fleischer years. Bluto was fantastic, too, with some great back-and-forth quips between himself and his rival. His voice was delivered by William Pennell from 1933-1935, then Gus Wickie from 1935 until his death in 1938. The voice of Olive Oyl was delivered by Mae Questel.

So, all you Popeye fans... this is what we have been waiting for many a year. Throw out all your other Popeye videos and DVDs. Get rid of your VHS tapes that you made from the Cartoon Network. Destroy (with pleasure) all of those horrible colorized Popeye's made infamous by Mr. Turner. Animation historian Jerry Beck says that ""your eyes will POP at the restorations. If you've never seen them you are in for a revelation."" At long last...the first official release of the Max Fleischer cartoons on DVD. Without a doubt, you will be absolutely, positively delighted!!!",1176422400,312,2438,5.185279187817259

2807518,5,B000P296AS,"Just received this collection in the mail and cannot say enough good things about it. These original uncut Popeye cartoons have never looked better!!!  This is not Saturday morning kids stuff either. The Fleischer cartoons were innovative for their time.  There is always movement across the screen. I haven't laughed so much in a long time.  They don't make cartoons like this anymore.  The character of Popeye was always my favorite growing up.  As an adult I can appreciate the humor more.  The mumbling that Popeye does is hysterical. I nearly lost it when in one of the cartoons Olive Oyl joins a women's gym and the voluptuous woman in charge (modeled after Mae West) approaches and Popeye mumbles "" nice equipment they have here"".  So funny.  If your only experience with Popeye are the made for TV shorts from the sixties you are in for a real treat. Popeye's character was watered down for TV to appeal to kids.  If you like Popeye you owe it to yourself to get this set. Some decent extras too.  I particularly enjoyed the documentary on the history of animation.

2807543,5,B000P296AS,"Normally, I get skeptical about these reviews that seem to glorify classic cartoons, but after watching these cartoons, I realized they were right. These cartoons are brilliant! Popeye The Sailor, though originally a comic strip character, is one of the most beloved animated cartoon characters of all time, and these Fleischer Studios cartoons, packed with lots of music, rubberhose animation, witty gags, and Popeye's signature witty muttering, as well as live action model backgrounds for many of the post-1934 shorts, and the overall urban settings, prove it. And because the Popeye cartoons were a spin-off from the Betty Boop cartoons, some of those early Popeyes contained a hint of surrealism similar to the Talkartoons that Fleischer Studios produced couple yeas earlier.

Given the age and the subsequent owners of the shorts (a.a.p., United Artists, MGM, Turner, & Warner Bros.), there are minor film scratches and dirt in these cartoons, but they look better than they would on public domain collections. And though some of the special features use clips of the colorized cartoons masquerading as black-and-whites, all of the cartoons here are the original B&W versions with Paramount logos spliced back onto the cartoons, though some of the ending titles appear to be frozen frame grabs slapped onto the video. Only die-hard fans will notice this.

What more is there to say? These are classics. This is probably Warner Bros.' best cartoon collection since the first Looney Tunes Golden Collection. Buy it now before it goes out-of-print, because it may not be available for streaming anytime soon.",1449360000,,1611,5.264591439688716

2807569,5,B000P296AS,"This was a gamble. So many things I liked as a kid just don't do it for me any more, and I always feel some sense of loss when that happens. Still, I remember these cartoons fondly, so it seemed worth a shot.

These just got better. All the good stuff I remembered was still there: the magnificent background art, Popeye's quiet running commentary (BTW, Robin Williams's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye/dp/B009NXD4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye</a>&nbsp;movie got that just right). But there's so much more. The extras tracks point out that Popeye's world was in the working underclass - make of that what you will. And then there's Sweeepea, the baby. Even as a kid, I kind of figured that Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Sweepea approximated a nuclear family. But now, with more years behind me, I wonder - was Sweepea fostered because of off-screen family woes? Or was Popeye taking a gentlemanly interest in a single mother's child (sired by whoever)? The happy superficial innocence lies as a thin veneer over social ills that we live with today. But, whatever the backstory, it looks genuinely happy. Whatever the challenges, I think the happy home and caring adults are what matter most to any child. I find it worth noting, too, that Olive isn't just the damsel in distress and game token of the male characters. As often as not, this princess takes active role in saving herself and getting her own needs met.

I saw these cartoons in the 1960s, perhaps  30 years after they were made. It's been at least 40 years (at this writing) since I first saw them. Somehow, more than twice as old, they haven't aged. They look as antiquated today as when I was a kid, way long ago - and that fact itself surprises me.

I liked these cartoons then. I like them as much,or more, now. All that was good then is still good (except for the overt racism), but so much has just gotten better - or maybe I just grew up to see what was good all along.

That aside, Popeye has always been my favorite cartoon character and I can't wait to get the other volumes. Fleischer studios were well ahead of their time with this classic star! I read that when these first came out, spinach sales soared because kids couldn't get enough!
One of my favorite memories was hearing some kids calling him Pie-Pie.

Wimpy (or J. Wellington Wimpy, as he is known) was another favorite. Eugene the Jeep, Swee' Pea, Bluto, (later named Brutus in the color series?!) and let's not forget Poopdeck Pappy!

The racial stereotypes, crude treatment of women, and excessive violence in the shorts may disturb some modern viewers, but there's plenty of clever writing, fantastic music, and beautiful animation to make this a worthwhile set. The films have been beautifully restored. Popeye never looked so good! Excellent contrast, crisp images, and almost no visible dust or scratches. I'm amazed by the quality. The producers have also been very generous with the extra features: a feature documentary on early animation, lots of short mini documentaries, and even a fistful of complete ""silent"" cartoons of the late 1910s and early 1920s. I particularly enjoy the early Fleischer ""Out of the Inkwell"" series, which seems to have had remarkably sophisticated animation for its time and funny gags to boot. (I only wish the producers could have hired a silent movie pianist or small orchestra to score the silent cartoons instead of leaving them *completely* silent.) This set is a bargain at full retail price, but it frequently is discounted by 50% or more at Amazon. At that price, it's a steal and even casual Popeye fans like myself will be thrilled to have it.

These shorts,  produced between 1933 and 1938,  are the best Popeye cartoons ever made.  The animators at Fleischer Studios were very faithful to cartoonist Elzie Segar's Popeye in these cartoons,  as if the daily Thimble Theater black-and-white comic strip had magically come to life.  Given the crude tools the studio had at its disposal then,  the fluidity of movement in these cartoons is that much more remarkable.  There are rough edges,  of course,  but that just adds to the charm of these cartoons,  as contrasted with the computerized fare you see in today's cartoons,  which is technically impressive but lacking in that human quality.

These cartoons have great action, humor, and animation, and are thoroughly enjoyable by kids and adults alike. This DVD collection has not only the best Popeye cartoons, but also the most Popeye cartoons, with the best picture and sound quality, the best commentaries, and the best featurettes. Do not bother renting any other Popeye DVDs. This collection has the first 60 Popeye cartoons, made by Fleischer Studio in the 1930's. The cartoons are complete, restored, and in order. There are 22 commentaries from various animators and historians, and most are very informative and interesting. There are two documentaries and eight featurettes, which also present a lot of history. There are also 16 very early silent Fleischer cartoons, but I did not find these at all entertaining. If you've never seen the Fleischer Popeye cartoons, they were in the 1930's what Bugs Bunny was in the 1940's: the most entertaining of all cartoons. Similar to Bugs Bunny, they are a mixture of action, humor, and great animation. Viewing these Popeye cartoons as an adult, they hold up extremely well. I have no advice on whether or not to let small children watch them, other than to say they are roughly like the Bugs Bunny cartoons of the 1940's.",1326758400,,1358,4.9605263157894735
2807616,5,B000P296AS,"If you are a fan of Popeye, it goes without saying that you will enjoy the most pristine, complete and uncut fully restored versions of the cartoons in chronological order with nothing left out. But what you get with this set is a lot more.

If you are familiar with modern computer animated features, you know the 3D feel that comes from the computer's ability to rotate models and look at them from different vantage points. What's amazing about many of these early Popeye shorts is that they managed to achieve the same effect in parts, and represent a level of hand drawn animation that has not been surpassed to this day.

As others have mentioned, these uncut versions include the original title sequences. That might not seem like a big deal, but the titles start with the opening music, which is a fundamental part of the overall orchestration done for each cartoon. If you think you know the Popeye opening theme song, pay close attention. You will hear a different arrangement from one cartoon to the next. Since Paramount studios held the publishing rights to the music in its other movies, Popeye was able to incorporate a musical score that would be hard to match in any modern cartoon.

For most people, the extra features are merely icing on the cake. The stories, the presentation, the ad libs, sight gags, and artistry already put the cartoons in a league of their own. But this set also provides context.

In addition to the Popeye cartoons, there are two complete documentaries. One covers the origins and development of Popeye, and shows how Popeye evolved from the original comic strip to the animated cartoon in all its incarnations. The other covers the birth and history of filmed animation itself.  If you aren't already familiar with the animation process, this documentary will show you how animation evolved from the mind blowing concept of a drawing that can move to the detailed and fully formed art that is present in the early Popeye cartoons.

This set also includes ""Popumentaries"" that are shorter features on subjects such as supporting characters, Olive Oyl, Wimpy, Bluto, and Swee'Pea.  Plus, there are audio commentaries to go with some of the episodes.

Additional content consists of early animation ranging from simple Krazy Kat and Heeza Liar cartoons to the Out of the Inkwell series.

I'm not normally a fan of commentaries, and on most discs I buy I don't even bother to listen to them. One complaint about the ones on these discs is that they range from mildly interesting to mediocre. What they really provide is context.

If you are interested in animation itself, watching the documentary is a good place to start. Watching the other animated shorts works well as a whole, especially when coupled with the documentary. Watching the early ones without that sense of context might not be very meaningful.

Watching the Out of the Inkwell series shows the evolution of the Fleischer' art from the most basic to the elaborate and gives a good feel for what made Popeye stand out from what came before it.

If you save the commentaries for last, you will find that they give you some more information about specific details or specific animators, but they overlap a lot with each other and cover a lot that was already mentioned in the documentaries. You will get some more details out of it, but I would not recommend going straight for the commentaries, or even listening to them before you've seen the supplemental features.

To be sure, you will get your fill of cartoon violence, battles between Popeye and Bluto over Olive, and lots of spinach, but you also get fleshed out ideas, Dave Fleisher's requirement of a gag in every scene, and the subtleties of Popeye's mumbling that might have been lost on you as a child. They may not be in color for the most part, but it's the later ones made years after the ones in this collection that truly lack the ""color"" found in these original ones.

While these cartoons do contain some ethnic stereotypes, sexism, and violence that would not done today, these are nevertheless appropriate for children and adults alike. Aside from all the special features, the cartoons themselves stand on their own merits as good entertainment.",1326672000,,4222,4.821576763485477
2807617,5,B000P296AS,"I can't say it enough, what a fantastic job Warner Bros. did with the restoration of these shorts, especially with the color features (huge difference with the public domain copies, which I have already). Popeye is one of my favorite classic cartoons growing up. I was used to watching the 60's and Hanna-Barbera versions via syndiaction as a child. Later, I was exposed to the Famous Studio shorts in the late 80's. I saw the B&W's on Cartoon Network with the horrible color and edited versions. Good thing I've waited for the price to come down (although the high price was worth it due to the remastering) so I can purchase a copy.

As for the ""warning"" disclaimer: GET OVER IT!!! There's plenty of stuff in music and movies right now that makes Popeye and all cartoons from the theatrical era look tame. Popeye was made for adults, but appealed to kids as he became famous.

If you love classic theatrical cartoons, I recommend this and others such as Woody Woodpecker (Vol #1), The Looney Tunes Golden Collections (I'm aiming to purchase someday), Droopy, the recently Re-released Tom and Jerry Golden Collection, and the Public Domain collections found at dept. stores (200 Colossal Cartoons, perhaps?) although they're poor in color/sound, but the contents still intact.

Vol's 2 and 3, here I come....

Enjoy the nostalgic trip as you watch these shorts.",1323820800,,1362,4.883116883116883
2807618,4,B000P296AS,"As you know Popeye was the industries most lucrative character until the advent of Bugs Bunny. In this sense it is great to see why these cartoons were so endurable. It had to do with personality, atmosphere, perspective and scale, and the hard work ethic of working class New York despite the fact that E.C. Segar came from Illonois. You see the zenith of arguably one of the greatest American cartoon series of all time. This predates the fall in Miami and the bastardization of the product under the Famous wing mostly due to the shift in management.

Essentially Popeye turned out to be a deathtrap for the Fleischer's Paramount was eager to commercially exploit to the extent that the were less focused on artistically expanding in the same sense that west-coast producers were. As a result the quality deteriorates which might be part of the reason why by the early forties we see Warner Bros. taking favor for its more slick and elaborate product. The other reason was that it was so lucrative that Paramount wanted to capitalize on the product all to themselves eliminating the Fleischer's out of the picture. The interviews and the commentaries in the special features don't seem to be conscious of the fact that the very series they were lauding which despite its many merits also happened to be the very thing that reformed the studio in Famous. The 1938 loan where he used his properties as collateral was the excuse for Paramount to attempt this. The special features don't go into intricate detail about the deterioration of the studio maybe because much of it might be above audiences heads.

Again the shorts are wonderfully restored and for a product that has such a niche market its great Warner's took the time and willpower to preserve and restore many of the classics. Commentaries vary people such as Micheal Barrier know what there talking about, some of them such as both John K and Kali seem to have no historical knowledge and just express enthusiasm which really isn't a reason for them to be there. Again the best features are in the restoration not the special features were credibility might vary. It is just about getting all these famous personalities of animation onto one set which some of these individuals might have little to no actual knowledge.

Again the cartoons are the reason for buying this hearing un-sourced talking points isn't an enjoyable endeavor.",1305331200,2,2397,4.8557457212713935
2807619,5,B000P296AS,"I have very warm memories of staying up late as a child and watching the black and white Popeye cartoons on the very new at the time Cartoon Network. All these years later I pick up this DVD set and expect some quality animation - but this went above and beyond my expectations: these early Popeyes are incredible, the result of the Fleischer Studios creators operating at their peak and the wonderful character of Popeye himself, culled from E.C. Segar's comic strip. Many of these cartoons follow a similar formula of Popeye vs. Bluto over Olive (though there are more varied plots than some give the series credit for, too), but the plots are often immaterial, nothing more than a skeleton to hang on an elaborate and surreal series of masterfully done visual gags and comic action pieces. Frankly, some of the visuals these Fleischer guys accomplished in these cartoons are jaw-dropping, even now, with all the advancements in visual effects in the almost eight decades since these cartoons came out. The character of Popeye is a bit brash in the earliest cartoons, even moreso than in Segar's comic, but he quickly settles down into that sweet spot of roughness coupled with a big heart that make the character who he is.

And supplementing this great material is a whole lot of entertaining and informative special features which range from the history of the Popeye character from his inception to today, a documentary about the beginning of animation, commentaries, and much, much (much) more.",1302048000,2,1501,4.909448818897638

2807622,4,B000P296AS,"Despite the fact that the 60 theatrical shorts in this collection (15 per disc, plus bonus material) date from the dark days of the Depression, I found myself recognizing one line after another from having seen the cartoons back in the early '60's on TV (those of you who grew up around that time in the New York area may have been watching with me, if you remember the Fred Hall Show).  And despite their very slight stories, utter lack of continuity, and the casual violence and physical impossibilities typical of non-Disney animation in this era, I found myself enjoying them all over again.  The ""one-eyed shrimp,"" as Bluto sometimes calls him, isn't always honest (he claims he ""hates all palookas what ain't on the up and square,"" but he and his ""goil,"" Olive Oyl, once sneak into the rodeo on one ticket) or courageous (he once runs from a guy with a sword).  But while he has a sharp tongue, he doesn't hit first; he's driven to it, usually, by some rival's aggression, unchivalry, or underhandedness.  He ""always keeps me woid,"" even to Bluto, and can often be found doing good deeds (like rebuilding Olive's house when it burns down) or helping those weaker than himself.  Even on his own he's strong--in the very first cartoon he reduces an entire mast to clothespins with one blow--but when the odds are high or the foe unscrupulous, at the last minute he pulls his can of spinach out of his middy (or perhaps Olive provides it) and becomes Superman (a character who hadn't yet debuted).  Indeed, he may be the very first superhero, even if, like Captain Marvel, he has to *do* something in order to tap his greatest powers.  As for Olive, she's sometimes fickle (in several segments she runs off with another man, has pictures of both Popeye and Bluto on her wall, or sighs admiration for the latter when he displays his physical prowess), but even though she screams ""Help!  Popeye!"" when threatened by Bluto or other would-be makers-of-time, she's quite adept at defending herself, with fists, a club, or her canal-boat feet; she can even knock Popeye himself cross-eyed, though she has to catch him by surprise to do it, and she's also a liberated woman, often seen as an entrepreneur or as Popeye's loyal and competent helper, and on one occasion as a lady blacksmith!  (Spinach works for her too, as when a Mae West-ish female boxer tries to steal Popeye--and even for Swee'Pea, the infant who's introduced in 1936 (there's no explanation of whose he is), who saves Popeye and Olive from a hydraulic press after eating it.)  Indeed, though the cartoons are preceded by a card disclaiming the ""ethnic, sexist, and racist stereotypes"" of the day, I saw only one segment (the last, ""Big Chief Ugh-a-Mug-Ugh"") that might be considered really offensive to any pressure group of today.  In fact, if you're willig to allow for the parameters of their era, these shorts have an important lesson to teach to kids of today: Never give up, always keep your word, and don't start fights, but if somebody else starts one with you, don't hesitate to whale the living daylights out of him.",1296864000,,3093,4.730483271375465
2807623,5,B000P296AS,"Popeye was my most favorite cartoon when I was a child. Now I bought this as a birthday gift to my 5 years old daughter. She laughs all the time when she watches it. So the 80 years old classic never fades away. Although Popeye is a little violent in modern standards, I think it's still OK to let young children watch; and it's always funny!",1284076800,,342,4.196969696969697
2807624,5,B000P296AS,"The product takes the form of four 1-sided discs, where each disc is stamped with an orange background and a black & white drawing of Popeye with Olive Oyl, Whimpy, Bluto, or Sweetpea.  The discs come in cardboard case, where thick, sturdy plastic inserts are attached to the case for holding the discs.  There are 60 cartoons in all, plus 24 extra cartoons featuring Popeye and friends, or other cartoon characters from a still earlier era, that is, from the years 1921 to 1933.  On the front of the cardboard case, the image of Popeye is 3-dimensional, that is, the cardboard had been put into a mold during manufacturing, so that image of Popeye is raised by about a millimeter.

The quality of the video images  on the discs is superb.  There are no streaks or lines.  The picture is stable and not jittery.  The voices are often, but not always distinct.  It is my guess that this was intentional.  Popeye spends a lot of time muttering things quickly.  Olive Oyl spends alot of time mumbling while fretting.  Whimpy never says much more than, ""I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.""

Most of these cartoons contain the same basic elements.  In a nutshell, Popeye and Bluto compete for the affections of Olive Oyl, get into a fistfight with each other, where Popeye eventually takes out a can of spinach and consumes it, as a source of super-human strength.  Usually, Popeye wins Olive Oyl's heart.

The following outlines a few of the plots:

THE TWO-ALARM FIRE.  Please note that this is one of the very best and most clever episodes.  Popeye and Bluto work in the same firehouse as firemen.  Olive's house is on fire.  I little flame runs down the sidewalk, climbs a little up a telephone pole, and yanks the fire alarm.  Flames shooting out of adjacent windows take the form of hands, and the flame-hands shake hands with each other.  Other flames move across the rooftop adn assume the shapes of moving ducks, and Popeye shoots the flame-ducks using water, one by one, just like at a shooting gallery at a state fair.  Bluto climbs on the roof to rescue Olive, but he is overcome.  Then Popeye rescues both of them.  5 STARS.

THE DANCE CONTEST.  Popeye and Olive had a date together at a dance contest.  Wimpy pulls a lever that eliminates poor dancers, by way of a trap door.  Actually, the dance floor has many such trap doors.  Bluto is already inside, and he ""borrows"" Olive from Popeye.  He proves to be a much better dancer than Popeye.  Wimpy gets busy pulling the lever.  Popeye eats his spinach, and turns into a splendid dancer, and he and Olive win the contest.  The dancing maneuvers were drawn very skillfully.  5 STARS.

WE AIM TO PLEASE.  Popeye and Olive open up a small diner in the city.  This cartoon begins with Popeye and Olive in a song and dance routine.  Wimpy orders a hamburger, but walks out without paying.  Popeye pushes a button on the cash register, and a sign pops up, and the sign reads, ""IN THE RED 20 CENTS.""  Bluto orders 6 sandwiches, but he tears up the bill for 60 cents.  Then there is a big fight.  Olive gives spinach to Popeye.  Popeye slugs Bluto, and Bluto turns into a big sausage, which hangs from the wall.  A sign materializes on the Bluto-sausage reading, ""60 CENTS.""  4 STARS.

MY ARTISTICAL TEMPERATURE.  We see a brick building labeled, ""Sweet Art Studio.""  Inside, Popeye is doing a sculpture, making Venus de Milo out of clay, and Bluto is doing a painting.  Both men wear French berets.  The arms of Venus keep sagging, because they're made of soft clay.  And so, Popeye snaps them off, thereby providing a Venus sculpture just like real Venus sculpture (lacking arms).  Olive comes into the art studio.  Bluto and Popeye fight.  Bluto throws Popeye into a painting of a Russian man, and Popeye is propelled through the painting, and all we see are his legs jutting out from the lower part of the canvas, and his legs to a typical Russian folk dance.  Olive proclaims, ""I'm getting out of here,"" but Bluto grabs her.  Bluto smashes a dozen canvases over Popeye's head, and Popeye proclaims, ""I've been framed.""  Finally, Popeye makes a sculpture of Olive, as Statue of Liberty, but holding a can of spinach instead of a torch.  4 STARS.

HOSPTALIKY.  Olive is a nurse in this episode, and she walks into a hospital.  Popeye and Bluto pretend to be sick, in order to gain admission, but Olive says no, they're not really sick.  Popeye insists, ""My high blood pressure is low.""  But this doesn't convince Olive.  Popeye stands in the middle of a busy intersection, with the goal of being run over, but somehow all the whizzing cars avoid hitting Popeye.  Bluto stands in a rock quarry hoping to get injured by dynamite, but as it turned out, he was standing on a pile or rocks in a dump truck, and the dump truck drives away before the dynamite explodes.  Popeye teases a bull with a red cape, and the bull charges. When the bull strikes Popeye, the bull bounces off and becomes a dozen sausages, which dangle from a nearby tree.  One of the sausages has a label with Hebrew writing, reading kosher.  Finally, Popeye feeds spinach to Bluto, and Bluto beats Popeye to a pump.  The result, is that Popeye succeeds getting admitted to the hospital, and getting tended to by Olive.  Despite the perverted plot line, I find that it is clever, so I give this one 5 STARS.

THE TWISKER PITCHER.  We see a baseball game featuring Popeye's team, Popeye's Pirates, and Bluto's team, Bluto's Bears.  Out on the playing field we see Popeye dropping his can of spinach into his baseball suit, for future emergency use.  But he drops it accidentally, and Bluto secretly eats it, and then fills the can with ordinary grass.  Popeye at bat, and the catcher signals to Popeye with semaphore flags.  Popeye's team is losing badly.  Then it is Popeye's turn to pitch, so he eats the can of spinach, not realizing that it is really grass. But he makes a face, indicating that the taste is wrong.  Popeye's team continues to do badly.  At this point, the score is 21 (Bluto) to zero (Popeye).  Then, Popeye takes out an envelope of grass seeds, plants them, resulting in a fast-growing spinach plant, and he eats the spinach, which results in a great improvement in his performance.  But in the last minute of the cartoon, the score is 21 to 22, and Popeye wins.  4 STARS.

BEWARE OF BARNACLE BILL. Popeye visits Olive and asks to get married.  But Olive says she loves Bluto (Barnacle Bill the sailor).  Olive and Popeye take turns singing the Barnacle Bill song.  Then Bluto shows up in his sailor suit, at Olive's house.  There is a big fight.  Bluto throws a chest of drawers at Popeye, and Popeye materializes from the top drawer. The fight continues, and Popeye tosses Bluto into the ocean.  Then Olive decides that she wants to marry Popeye instead.  But Popeye changes his mind and calls her a ""cabbage head.""  3 STARS.

BE KIND TO ANIMALS.  Olive and Popeye are in the park feeding seeds to birds.  Bluto has a banana cart, pulled by a horse.  Bluto whips the horse and prevents the horse from drinking from a bathtub by the road, clearly labeled as being water for horses, and Bluto hoists the bathtub into the air, and drinks all the water himself, leaving the horse very thirsty.  Olive yells at Bluto to stop whipping, but Bluto yells, ""Mind your own business, you long-legged scarecrow.""  Popeye eats a box of spinach that was in the back of the banana cart.  There is a big fight.  Bluto ends up pulling the banana cart, while the horse sits in the driver's seat, and holds the whip in his mouth, and whips Bluto.  3 STARS.

PLEASED TO MEET CHA.  Popeye and Bluto come to visit Olive, but one rings the bell to the front door, and the other rings the bell to the back door.  Once inside, they have a fight.  Bluto slugs Olive with his fist, in order to get her out of the way.  Then, the three of them sit calmly on the couch with Olive in the middle.  Bluto and Popeye then agree to a contest of practical jokes, in order to determine who gets Olive.  These take the form of THREE STOOGES type pranks, where dishes get smashed over their heads.  Olive laughs and laughs.  Then there is a big fight, and Olive's furniture gets demolished.  Popeye wins, and he does a great trick.  He whisks the carpet, causing all of the furniture to be restored in unbroken condition, and sitting neatly on the carpet.  In my opinion, this is one of the more perverted Popeye cartoons.  2 STARS.

One of the greatest trivia questions in the Free World is as follows:  ""Who did the voice of Olive Oyl?""  The answer is, the same woman who does the voice of BETTY BOOP.  Her real name is, Mae Questel (1908-1998).

The typical viewer might get tired of all of the fist-fighting, when watching four or more episodes in a row.  Therefore, I recommend that any person buying these Popeye discs, watch these episodes with restraint, that is, watch only two or three cartoons in one sitting, and not more.",1282176000,3,8956,4.553739786297926
2807625,5,B000P296AS,"For just a moment, fair viewer, set aside the politically correct programming constantly being pumped into your skull and just enjoy these cartoons for what they are--fun.  Do you remember fun? It was that thing we used to have before everyone got so  sensitive.
  Does Popeye  punch people? Yes. Is the violence over the top? You betcha. Is it  probably one of the high points of hand-drawn animation?  Absolutely. In the  over-sensitized, Pokemon-type animation world we live in now, it might be hard to relate to at first. You might not know what to do with a cartoon that actually  is drawn at a decent frame rate, or one that doesn't cause seizures. You may have to actually pay attention to get some of the inside gags.

It's nice to finally be able to watch these cartoons as they were intended to be seen, instead of as substandard public domain transfers. There are awesome documentaries about animation history in general and the Fleischer studios. There are even a few other cartoons included to show examples of very early animation. Some of the commentaries are really informative too. The Popeye shorts are funny and entertaining (I frequently laugh out loud while watching) with much better stories than the drivel on TV nowadays. The scores are superb and I love the use of music and exaggerated cartoon movement, things sadly lacking in contemporary cartoons. I probably watch the discs in this set more than anything else in my collection. I highly recommend volume one of the Popeye shorts for anyone who appreciates cartoons themselves, those with an interest in film history, or parents who want to show their children GOOD cartoons.",1264896000,2,1013,5.108433734939759

2807633,5,B000P296AS,"When Ted Turner decided to colorize the Fleischer Popeye cartoons, he was greeted with universal derision. Why? The problem, explains former editor of Animato! magazine, Pat Duquette, was the primitive nature of the process, which took out much of the background. This was not a problem for Turner's later, painstaking restorations of live-action films, as the process also created a restored black and white version, many of which now air on TCM.

But, finally, here's the real deal. The premium price tag on this set shows the high cost of restoration, but to animation fans, it's worth it to see the real thing. So many reviewers have commented on this long-awaited set, that I'll just briefly remark on the treasure trove of extras.

First, this set is done right. There are four one-sided discs, which snap into plastic holders, with the contents printed on the back and cover flap, and which slide into a protective outer box. The special features are listed, so you don't have to go to the on-screen menus, although they are also there. Numerous 'toons have alt versions with commentary from a who's who of films and animation, including: Dave Tendlar, Jerry Beck, John Kricfalusi, Michael Barrier, and Jack Mercer (who voiced Popeye).

But there are many more faces featured in interview segments on the eight ""Popumentaries"", which range from short subjects to featurettes. Even better are two full-length documentaries on discs one and two, about the history of Popeye and Elzie Segar's newspaper comic, ""Thimble Theater"", from whence he came, and the roots of early animation. The other extras include: six early, short cartoons from the Bray Studio, and ten Fleischer ""Out of the Inkwell"" silent shorts.

The disclaimer on the cover reads: ""Popeye the Sailor 1933-1938 Volume One is intended for the adult collector and may not be suitable for children."" Why? Many would site the obvious violence, but starting with the second cartoon, ""I Yam What I Yam"" there are ethnic stereotypes of Indians (Native Americans) and Mexicans. To put it in perspective, however, these cartoons were not meant to stereotype races, but parody the live action Westerns and adventure films with which they were shown.

One account of the ethnic stereotypes in early animation is given by animator Shamus Culhane in his autobiography, Talking Animals and Other People&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talking-Animals-And-Other-People/dp/0306808307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talking Animals And Other People</a>. Early American animation was centered in New York, peopled with diverse Immigrant neighborhoods. The animators were eager to join the American melting pot, and lose, rather than preserve, their European distinctives. Families regularly shortened their names to streamlined, easy to pronounce American ones, as expatriates in the brave new world. Ethnic characteristics were easy to exaggerate, as was regularly done in editorial cartoons. In this, as in so many ways, animators simply reflected the climate of their day.

The long wait is over. Fans have long clamored for pristine restorations of these and other theatrical cartoons, and in this case, against all odds, the studio listened.",1249776000,,3237,5.4769539078156315
2807634,5,B000P296AS,"Once this famous cartoon series kicks in - about the sixth episode - it's fantastic, some of the best Popeye efforts ever.  You cannot beat the Popeye cartoons of the mid 1930s!

The artwork is incredible, especially in the big city scenes.  There is an amazing amount of detail and the stories get wackier and wackier, which means funnier and funnier. Of all the Popeye sets, and I think I've seen them all, this one is the best.

A pleasant surprise are all the great bonus features.  The best might have been the inventive silent cartoons of the Fleischer Brothers.  Having no sound is not easy to watch, in this day-and-age, but the Ko-Ko The Clown stories are so clever that it will keep you glued to the TV set.",1249430400,,717,4.476923076923077

2807636,5,B000P296AS,"I'm glad that with all the Star Wars and Play Station my kids watch and play they also get a big kick out of something almost 100 years old! The Popeye episodes are very short (some seem like 4 minutes!) but it keeps their attention.  Popeye cartoons are full of action, and contrary to all other kids cartoons today, they have almost no dialog; some episodes have maybe like 10 words spoken in the whole thing.  Popeye is more about doing things rather than saying things.  I give it 5 stars because, for being so old, I mean these people did this all by hand (no computer - I'd like to see today's cartoon makers try that!) the graphics are clever and creative.  My kids are in the other room watching it now and I can hear them giggling.  It's almost like a history lesson for them.",1241827200,,785,4.312925170068027
2807637,5,B000P296AS,"I've been a big Popeye fan since I was a kid.  Not the cheesy cartoons that were cheaply produced by King Feature Studios in the 1960's, but the classic 1930's B&W cartoons from the Fleischer Studios that were shown on Tom Hatten's program in the early 1960's.  With the exception of a brief renaissance of these classic gems in the mid 1970's (and -- gasp! --colorized versions of these on the Cartoon Network), these cartoons in their original form have remained in oblivion since then.  For a number of years I had been searching online for a set --  ANY set -- of these classic gems.  Thanks to this wonderful compilation, my search has finally come to an end!

This set has not only met, but far exceeded my expectations.  Not only have they been lovingly restored by Warner Brothers, but the sound and print quality are exceptional, showcasing the full, fluid animation of the characters (which were on the same caliber as early Disney and Warner Brothers shorts), and the spectacular hand-drawn background scenes that worked in perspective instead of a flat background scene repeating over and over, as was the norm for limited-animation cartoons.  And they even restored the original Paramount logos on the leader and trailer!

Even though many of the story lines were based on the same premise as the later Popeye cartoons -- Popeye and Bluto (or Brutus in the 60's cartoons) -- fighting over Olive Oyl; Bluto trying to harm Olive Oyl; Popeye eating his spinach and beating up Bluto to rescue Olive Oyl -- there were a lot more sight gags and plays on words than in the later versions.  Also Popeye's ad-libbed mutterings under his breath only add to the hilarity.  Notice the intricate timing in the construction zone while Olive Oyl, Popeye and Bluto are ""sleepwalking"" in ""A Dream Walking""; the factory scenes as Popeye and Olive Oyl try to rescue Swee'Pea in ""Lost and Foundry,"" and the clever use of spinach cans in ""The Spinach Roadster.""  Additionally, there were other cartoons such as ""Lost and Foundry,"" ""Spinach Follies"" and ""Brotherly Love"" that deviated away from the basic storyline, and these Fleischer cartoons in general featured a lot more song and music.  Listen and laugh out loud at Olive Oyl's solo rendition of ""Why Am I So Beautiful"" on ""Morning, Noon and Night Club.""

Even though these cartoons would be considered ""politically incorrect"" and violent by today's standards (and, to some degree, were back in their day as well), they hark back to more innocent times when people laughed more easily at other people's expenses and weren't as uptight about offending certain groups.  Popeye's abominable table manners while eating his spinach only adds to the hilarity and certainly didn't warp me as a kid.  Thankfully, Warner Brothers has added a disclaimer to the beginning of this set warning viewers of this so as to avoid any surprises.

The icing on the cake is the special features section, including Koko the Clown, Felix the Cat (the hilarious 1920's versions, not the cheesy redo's of the 1960's) and some full-color, two-reel cartoons, such as ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor"" and ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves.""  Even though the picture jumped a little in the ""Sinbad"" cartoon, that's just a minor flaw compared to the superb quality of the rest of the cartoon.

For you longtime Popeye fans, enjoy this trip down memory lane, and for those of you who have been exposed to these gems in their original B&W glory for the first time, welcome to a fun and, hopefully, entertaining addiction.",1232668800,3,3563,4.869205298013245
2807650,5,B000P296AS,"As others have commented, this set is just about perfect.  The transfers are unbelievably clear for the age of the source material and the sound is well done too.  Some of the animation is better than anything you've ever seen, including today's CGI animation.  The color two-reelers are the stuff of animation legend, and perfectly presented.  The documentaries are very well done, especially those that cover the birth of film animation.

The only issue I have is the same as many others have.  Maybe the three giggling commentators on some of the shorts have the credentials to make them ""experts"", but you'd never know it by their inane patter.  They're too busy having fun among themselves to tell us much of interest.",1232409600,,723,4.877049180327869

They are black and white but the the quality is superb. The video is super clean and the audio is the best considering the age of these shorts. I started watching Popeye in the early sixties and I guess these were pulled from syndication before I came along. Imagine my surprise at getting the chance to see these shorts as Popeye came of age along with the art of animation. Quite a treat for me anyway.

The Fleischer Studios produced some really nice stuff. Beating Disney to some eye catching tricks. Not that Disney didn't keep up. These shorts are not as PC as Disney's stuff which makes them all the more engaging.

My HAT is off to Warner Brothers for a first class restoration job. You guys are the best!",1230336000,,873,4.484276729559748
2807653,5,B000P296AS,"Popeye the Sailor is one of the most iconic characters in animation, a bloke who champions peace and only puts up his dukes when looking to set things right. As a child, the Popeye shorts were my most favorite series of all time, and that feeling has followed me into my adulthood, in which I am now a big animation enthusiast. And now, I can finally watch them in their original, uncut, black-and-white masters, the way they were meant to be seen. A plus is the choice for releasing the shorts in chronological order, allowing you to document the evolution of the series. In the first volume set, you receive 60 shorts from 1933 to 1938, two of which are from the trilogy of famous color two-reelers: ""Popeye meets Sinbad the Sailor"" and ""Popeye meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves"". The cartoons are all amazingly animated and very humorous and charming, giving you chuckles big and little throughout. The restoration is marvelous, as there is no single speck of grain, and the sound comes in clear as a bell. Even more astonishing is the wealth of extras: several documentaries (big and small) outlining the Popeye series and various details within it, as well as a heaping helping of vintage silent cartoons from the 1910s and 1920s, including severalshorts from  ""Out of the Inkwell"", the Fleischer Studios' first successful series!

This is a set not to be missed, for fans of Popeye, fans of cartoons, or just plain for the child in us all! And seeing as how King Features finally agreed to letting these out on official home video, you can bet the entire series is going to be treated this nicely by Warner Bros.!",1222128000,,1616,4.686619718309859

The charm of these original Popeye cartoons to me - beyond the top-quality animation style, of course - has always been the unique blend of clever and outrageous sight gags, the hilarious ad libs and the catchy musical soundtracks. The good folks who put this all together must have feasted on spinach because this collection is also packed with informative and entertaining special features telling all about Popeye, his comic strip origins and the innovative masterminds behind these animated classics at Fleischer Studios. The only downside in the entire package are the audio commentaries from a trio who appear on a handful of the features including the color two-reelers. Be forewarned that their audio tracks are nearly intolerable to listen to and even worse, these three offer little, if any, relevant information. Granted this stuff isn't rocket science, but they obviously came unprepared and are a real disappointment. I can't imagine why the producers of this terrific collection chose to keep them on. However, the other commentators are very good so this is a minor complaint and shouldn't affect at all your decision to purchase this collection. I was introduced to these cartoon classics on TV years ago and they're every bit as entertaining as I remembered them.

I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching cartoons. I grew up with these. When I was a kid, I was completely entertained, but simply accepted them at face value. Now, as an adult, I can fully appreciate the undercurrent of total absurdity that flows through them. Some of them make me laugh out loud. It's so refreshing seeing these restored to their original crisp, black and white glory. It's like seeing them for the first time. The depression era New York Setting featured in many of them was a real departure from what the other animation studios we're doing. I love the often gritty backgrounds framing all of the nonsense going on in the foreground. The Sindbad and Ali Baba color two reelers are absolutely stunning. I've seen them so many times over the years I practically have them memorized, but they never looked anything like they do here. Not even close. This collection is worth every penny just for those two. I just got my hands on Volume 2 and it looks like the same for the Aladdin color two-reeler. I haven't started watching that collection yet, but I had to take a peek.
  There's an embarrassment of riches with the supplementary materials which strike a good balance between scholarly and entertaining. The brief ""Popumentaries"" sprinkled throughout the collection provide great insight and fun facts on selected cartoons. The audio commentaries are a lot of fun even if they don't always reveal a lot of in-depth information. The ""Out of the Inkwell"" cartoons provide a fascinating look at early animation. Even if you just have a casual interest in animation, you'll find most of the supplementary materials well worth your time. If you are more of an aficionado, you might learn something new or see something you haven't seen before.
 I have one criticism. The advertising at the beginning of disc four is extremely irritating. I watch two or three cartoons at a time rather than going through a whole disc in one sitting (why eat the whole carton of ice cream when a couple of scoops will do?). Every time I put on disc four, I had to fast forward through the advertising. Hitting the menu button didn't seem to bypass it. It was annoying the first time, but after dealing with it repeatedly, it was beyond tedious. Even with that, I still have to give this collection five stars. It really delivers.

The first three discs, anyway. The image is too rock steady. Too sharp. Even the best transferrs have slight imperfections. These are perfect. The toons themselves have varying degrees of changes in density and slight jumps as old film is prone to do. Only when you get to disc 4 do you see what is probably a direct transfer of the titles. Anyone out there able to check it out? Please don't get me wrong. I am very glad to have these toons. You won't go wrong in buying them. One toon even appears to have nitrate damage, so I'm glad they did these transfers before it was too late. And I am anxiously awaiting volume two.

2807661,5,B000P296AS,"Aside from the brilliant job on restoration, I must mention that after getting reacquainted with these shorts, it's very obvious that the Fleischer cartoons featuring Popeye were much more funny and inventive and imaginative than anything that other animation studios were putting out at the time. Other cartoons seem so safe, bland and sugary in comparison. The Popeye shorts really pushed the limit on silliness and fun, as well as creativity and imagination. The situations are very funny and wacky, which is exactly what the medium of cartooning was made for.... to exaggerate and go over the top.

Seeing these hilarious films again I am reminded strongly that the people who made them were heavily involved with brilliant writing, background art, voice characterizations, use of perspective (something you rarely see in animation, especially this early in the 20th century), squash and stretch, wonderful musical compositions for each short, and just a great sense of whimsy and fun.",1209772800,2,989,5.2993630573248405
2807662,5,B000P296AS,"I am a hard core Popeye fan. Many of you who reviewed the Warner-restored Popeye cartoons have sold me on the product. But one question remains: Is there a Warner logo in the lower right corner of the screen?
Nothing offends me more - well, almost nothing - than someone's distracting, disturbing and annoying stamp of ownership on someone else's masterpiece. I bought a set from some joker that is absolutely an insult to the Fleischer legacy. It's the same cartoons, but not the same. Bad 12th generation copies..logos in some, not in others..so-called expert commentators in between films. I just want the unadulterated product. It speaks for itself. Anything added or taken out is 1st degree murder of great art.
This was supposed to be a review so I will say this: If you have what you all said you have in this restoration/ compilation, then every man woman and child should have a copy of this set. Absolutely the finest animation ever accomplished. And so much more.",1209081600,2,974,4.769230769230769

2807664,4,B000P296AS,"I agree with most all of you - this is a fantastic collection.  Great choice of films, representative of the Fleischers' best work.  Too bad the Disney types beat them out - who knows how much more imaginative American cartoons could have been had they followed the Fleischers' lead.  But that just makes us appreciate the Fleischers more.

BONUS:  Out of the Inkwell silent toons, Krazy Kat, Koko, and many others you would never have seen.

But of course, even in a great collection like this, there always seems to be a problem.  In this case it's the commentaries.  Some are fine, but there are way too many by John ""Ren and Stimpy"" Kricfalusi, another director I never heard of, and an ""animation student"" who does nothing but giggle stupidly in the background.

2807665,5,B000P296AS,"There are two kinds of cartoon collections being put out. The first is created purely to cash in on nostalgia and the second is released by people who legitimately love the subject. The Popeye collection is clearly a labor of love. When I was young I never properly appreciated just how fantastic these classic black and white Popeye cartoons are particularly compared to the later color versions. The backgrounds are astounding and I'm still not quite sure how they did them. Many of them have a three dimensional appearance as if they were actually physically constructed, filmed and then overlaid with animation cells for the characters. In fact I suspect that's exactly how they were done and the effect is amazing. The character animation is from a time before animators came up with tricks to minimize work and the Herculean effort to fully animate every frame of character movement makes a huge difference.

Besides the wonderful cartoons themselves what sets this collection apart is the special features which are so well done. Many of the cartoon shorts contain commentary by other artists. Some are better than other but most are pretty interesting. Each disk has features on various characters including Olive Oil, Bluto and Wimpy as well as information on Fleischer Studios and the history of early animation. They even contain some rare animation that pre-dates the earliest Popeye cartoons. These old cartoons are pretty primitive and most if not all have no sound but it's still nice to know that they're being preserved.

The cartoons are an absolute blast. I watched them with my friend's 4 year old daughter and she loved them and would toot along with Popeye during the opening theme. I'm not positive that these cartoons are completely appropriate for children of that age having a tremendous amount of cartoon violence including a lot aimed at Olive Oyl. My personal belief is that the violence is so over the top that only the rare child would take it seriously. Olive is so flexible and noodle-like she seems neigh on indestructible and Popeye and Bluto are clearly inhuman.

If you love these cartoons let me also suggest the reissues of the original early 1930's Segar comics being put out by Fantagraphics. Between these two, fans of Popeye should be completely satisfied.",1205971200,4,2299,4.981770833333333

I think there are about 12+ male interviewees, and just one female. Since I have been in the field for a while, I know that there ARE highly regarded and influential women in the critical study and producing field of animation.

2807704,4,B000P296AS,"In 1929,comicstrip readers checked out Popeye the Sailor and his popularity led to multiple appearances on the big screen for 25 years. In 1933,Popeye debuted on the big screen alongside another Paramount cartoon star,Betty Boop. The late Mae Questel assumed a dual role voicing Betty and Popeye's skinny-as-a-string-bean girlfriend Olive Oyl. You will see Popeye and Betty together in the first cartoon of this series. My personal experiences with these cartoons were first seeing them on New York-based WPIX Channel 11 in my native New Jersey. They were black-and-white,as originally presented but mutilated with A.A.P.(Associated Artists Productions) prefixes and suffixes. Some of the cartoons even had an anchor end title with the words ""THE END"". The only one that was never mutilated at all was PROTEK THE WEAKERIST from 1937. The cartoon had retained its original Paramount mountain logo opening and closing titles(the closing title read ""A Paramount Picture""). In January 1982,after more than two decades of broadcasts,WPIX evicted Popeye from its Monday-Saturday morning line-up. I saw the cartoons again in 1987 on TBS Superstation and they looked somewhat pretty because they had been colorized(in Korea). The colorized versions retained the A.A.P. titles. When TNT(Turner Network Television) debuted in October 1988,the station aired the cartoons also and later they were broadcast by Cartoon Network. In the case of the CN broadcasts,many of the cartoons were further mutilated with,in the opening title,Popeye's pipe then his full face and in the closing title,the anchor and ""THE END"". TBS,TNT and CN aired PTW with the colorized Paramount mountain logo opening and closing titles. Now for the first time,you will see all these cartoons fully restored to the original black-and-white with original opening and closing titles. This package contains a couple of two-reel color cartoons(how they were filmed),ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES and POPEYE MEETS SINBAD THE SAILOR(Sinbad was Popeye's nemesis Bluto who's in love with Olive also). Supporting the Paramount star also are J. Wellington Wimpy,with a frequent passion and appetite for hamburgers,a baby named Swee Pea and a variety of guest characters. You'll be ""strong to the finich,with this and some spinach""! It was exactly a half-century ago when Popeye had retired from the big screen but resumed his career in 1960 on the small screen. Popeye's small screen appearances continued on and off through 1982 of '83. Logically,Robin Williams played the title role in the 1980 theatrical film,distributed by Paramount(this marks Williams' starring film debut).",1195948800,2,2631,5.498765432098765
2807705,5,B000P296AS,"I remember seeing these as a child on TV on the ""Popeye and Pals"" kids' show in New Orleans--that show lasted into the late '80's, by the way! I taped them on my first Betamax in the early '80's and practically drooled when Cartoon Network began running them with the original Paramount titles. After 25 years, it was worth the wait. When I put on ""Sindbad"" my jaw dropped at the vivid colors. I brought my set to my sister's house, where her three- and five-year old grandchildren were watching one of those cheap public domain discs of old TV prints with badly washed-out color. I put on disc three and at the beginning of Sindbad the five-year-old boy says, ""Look! The snakes are green!""

2807706,5,B000P296AS,"One or twice a year, a DVD comes out that just makes you say, ""It's about time!"" Popeye the Sailor Volume One 1933 - 1938, is one of those DVDs. Like the Disney Treasures sets, this first volume presents 60 animated shorts in chronological order on four discs that are loaded with bonus features. These 60 shorts were all produced by the Fleischer Studios. The Fleischer Studios may not be a household name to a lot of people today, but during the 30's and early 40's, they were on a par with the likes of Disney and Warner Bros. animation studios, perhaps even surpassing them in terms of technical innovations. The Fleischer's Superman cartoons of the 40's are still some of the very best superhero cartoons ever produced. The Fleischer's utilized techniques such as three-dimensional backgrounds and rotoscoping to produce dazzling animation and the Popeye cartoons are arguably their greatest achievement. In all, the studio produced 108 Popeye shorts, including three two-reelers that were produced in gorgeous Technicolor.

The studio was purchased by Paramount in 1942. So how did these shorts go from Paramount to being released in this collection by Warner Bros.? Well that's quite a tale. Paramount renamed the studio Famous Studios and produced Popeye cartoons from 1942 to 1957. Paramount then sold Popeye to Associated Artists productions, who was in turn bought out by United Artists. United Artists merged with MGM and MGM was later purchased by Turner Entertainment. Turner Entertainment is part of the Time Warner, thus the set is being released by Warner Bros. Whew!

The set begins with Popeye's debut in ""Popeye the Sailor"" which was actually a Betty Boop cartoon, Fleischer's major star prior to Popeye. The first few early toons are notable in that while Popeye does eat his spinach, he doesn't yet have his signature theme music playing when he does it. What makes these cartoons so different that others of the era is the dialog and use of music. Many of these shorts featured well-known songs of the era. Then there are the famous Popeye mutterings. Listen close and turn up the volume, some of the best dialog is often barely audible as Popeye mutters to himself, all without his mouth moving.

Popeye is joined by his co-stars Olive Oyl, Bluto, Whimpy, and later, Sweat Pea. Of course, the running theme through many of the shorts is Popeye and Bluto both vying for Olive's affections as she usually played the boys against each other. But these shorts were quite diverse. There are even times when Popeye and Bluto are friendly with each other, even business partners as deep sea salvagers in ""Dizzy Divers.""

It's virtually impossible to pick a favorite from among the 60 shorts but two of the most well-known are certainly the ones done in Technicolor, ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor"" and Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's forty Thieves."" The former even earned and Academy Award nomination. These shorts were often billed above the main feature in theatres when they were released. These have been fully restored with the original Paramount opening credits, missing from many of the VHS releases of these shorts.

As mentioned the set is loaded with features including two 30-minute documentaries on the history of Popeye and the roots of animation. Then there are eight shorter ""popumentaries"" on various subjects such as the voice talent, music, and a look at all of the various characters. These all run about five minutes in length. Also included are sixteen vintage animated shorts from the silent era, featuring pre-Popeye characters like Krazy Kat and Mutt & Jeff. Finally, there is audio commentary on 21 of the 60 shorts by film and animation historians. All in all, there is SEVEN hours of material in this set that will delight Popeye fans. This is what DVD was made for!

2807710,5,B000P296AS,"I count myself among the fans who have waited for YEARS for someone in corporate America to appreciate the value and the demand for these classic, Fleischer Popeye cartoons from the 1930s and make them available on DVD.  Well the wait was long but the payoff was worth it.

All kinds of things COULD have gone wrong with the release of this set.  The cartoons could have been colorized.  Some of the crude ethnic humor in vogue in the  1930s could have been edited out in the name of ""political correctness.""  None of this happened.  Instead, someone treated these classic cartoons with the respect they deserve.  The images and sound have been meticulously restored and the cartoons appear to be uncut and uncensored in any way.  THANK YOU WARNER HOME VIDEO!!!

In addition to these remarkable old cartoons (I think there are 60 in chronological order), there are some extra features that are quite interesting including a brief history of animation from 1900 to 1920 and some insider info on Popeye's voices over the years.  Also some very rare silent cartoons (not Popeye) from the very early 1900s.  The only extra features I DON""T appreciate are ""commentaries,"" optional replays of some of the Popeye cartoons with some knucklehead's running commentary dubbed over the cartoon's soundtrack.  Who needs someone to explain what's happening?  But you don't have to watch these if you're not interested...the original cartoons are there in all their funky, innovative, original glory.

Please BUY THIS SET and tell your friends as well so that Warner Home Video will decide to bring out ""Vol 2.""  If sales are slow, they just may decide there's not enough market for ""Popeye Vol. 2"" and other gems that are moldering in their studio vaults.  Let's prove them wrong.",1191369600,2,1766,4.912162162162162
2807711,5,B000P296AS,"Simply put, this is a wonderful collection of the greatest cartoon character of all time.  This is exactly the collection that life long fans, such as myself, have been waiting for.  I was a small, weakly child--I suffered from asthma and violent fits of eczema--as it always made me feel better the beileve that all it would take is a gulp of some spinach to get brutal revenge upon the bullies who tormented me.  I never got a chance to try it, though, mostly because my father was almost obsessivly carnivorous and allowed very little roughage in the house.
Anyway. This is the collection that all popeye fans have been waiting for.",1191024000,,635,4.651785714285714
2807712,4,B000P296AS,"What makes it worth four stars:
The video quality of these vintage cartoons is amazing!  Another plus are the many commentary tracks on various 'toons.

What keeps it from being five stars:
These early stories are a splice--50% inspired by the newspaper strip by E. C. Segar and 50% inspired by the sensibilities of the day re: cartoons.  These early shows include speaking animals and a cast that sings--such things are foreign to the Popeye in newspapers (which can be enjoyed because they have all been reprinted by Fantagraphic Books as ""The Complete E. C. Segar Popeye"" (multiple volumes) and starting over again with ""Popeye: I Yam What I Yam"").  My other (mild) complaint is not about content but presentation, i.e. that the silent shorts included as bonus features are indeed *silent*--some background music (as would have been provided in the theaters of the day) would have been much appreciated.  However, this is a minor quibble, as these are only extras...

Overall, this is a wonderful collection, and value priced at that.  Recommended.",1190851200,4,1051,5.040462427745664
2807713,5,B000P296AS,"It's a shame that the black and white barrier will prevent a lot of people from purchasing this collection. These are some of the best cartoons ever made and in a number of ways better then most of the animated output being made today. These are examples of pure comedy animation. The restorations are incredible and if you remember the old TV prints or the horrible colorized tracing that are still being shown on cable today, these films are a revelation.

The extras range from good to extraordinary. The ""Popumentaries"" go from silly to interesting. The History of Animation is an excellent primer on the very early years of the art form. The collection of silent films in ""From the Vaults"" range from curious (some of the early films are tough to sit through) to astonishing. There are at least two ""Out of the Inkwell"" cartoons that are clearly struck from the original negatives! Besides the wonderful penmanship of the Koko cartoons (they were frequently animated on paper, no cels), you can see that the surreal imagination of the Fleischers was there from the beginning. They actually preceded the Surrealist art movement.

I liked Popeye as a kid but was truly surprised by the quality of the animation and the restorations: many of these cartoons are not only still amusing but quite beautiful, and the 2 technicolour shorts are a pop-eyed joy. There are a number of extras included on each of the 4 discs, the most interesting being a plethora of silent Fleischer cartoons and a couple of extended documentaries on the history of silent animation and Popeye himself; the ""Popumentaries"" are very brief and an amusing addition. Although I haven't heard all the commentaries, they seem to vary greatly in quality (John Kricfalusi and cronies: PLEASE prepare something interesting to say in future!)

Also on the disks are a number of silent movie era cartoons.  They are interesting, and some of them are still funny.  The documentaries about Popeye and Segar are good.

2807719,5,B000P296AS,"Fans of TRUE animation should dance in the streets! This is the REAL DEAL with the Popmeister. None of that post-Famous Studios junk of the 60s and 70s or the recent abominations that all suck raw eggs or were ruined by the panty-waisted Barney & Care bears-loving Politically Correct brigade! If it doesn't say ""Fleischer"" or begin with the cabin deck opening with the titles-leave them alone like the 3 Stooges without Curly!

Now back to the disc set. Some really classic stuff is here. The very first Popeye cartoons are here. The surrealistic scenery, the inventive gags, the wacky humor, and very likeable characters (our man's under-the breath mutterings are a real hoot). I YAM WHAT I YAM has a bizzare gag that would be at home with the likes of the SIMPSONS and their sorry copycats (the abominations FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD) today-after Popeye socks an Indian Chief, he turns into Mahatma Gandhi!

LEARN POLIKENESS (familiarity with ""Popspeak"" helps here) is a real knee-slapper, with Olive Oyl bringing our man in for refinement lessons-taught by none other than ""Professor Bleutau"" (archvillan Bluto in a thin disguise). Guess the results. A CLEAN SHAVEN MAN has Popeye and Bluto trying to ""get clean"" to win Olive's hand, resulting in an interesting surprise ending.

PROTECK THE WEAKEST is a personal favorite. Our man is forced by Olive to walk her prissy pup. The Spinach King replies in Popspeak, ""A he-man like me can't be seen with a sissy dorg like that!"" When the pampered pooch realizes that Popeye is ashamed of him, he produces a saddened look that anyone who has ever been rejected unfairly for any reason can relate to. Such is the charm of these classic cartoons, they are a perfect mix of offbeat fantasy with just enough reality to cause viewers to identify with the characters and situations.

Of course there is the 1936 20-minute color masterpiece SINBAD THE SAILOR with it's breathtaking scenery and wonderful gags that still astonish viewers 71 years later, and it's companion piece ALI BABA. Also included are ""Popumentaries"" that tell the complete history of Popeye-maina with some information on E.C. Segar (Popey's creator) and Frank ""Rocky"" Fleagle, the funny-faced fighter who inspired our sailor friend.

HOWEVER, only the most hardcore of cartoon geeks will like the plethora of silent cartoons included. Truth is, aside from Uncle Walt and the grandmaster pioneer Windsor McCay, silent cartoons were not that funny or intersting aside from historical reasons. But the documentary on Animation history is VERY well done and an improtant addition.

Also, it is important to note that a pair of popular productions of Popeyedom are absent in this set. ALADDIN, the third of the early color masterpieces which is chock full of politically incorrect humor (the Yiddish-accented Jewish genie and the cartoon Muslims who greet each other with ""Salami Salami Baloney""-Don't let this DVD NEAR the Middle east today!) but is actually quite brilliant to watch. Also likely to appear in the next set is GOONLAND, a really classic scary piece of Popeye searching for his father on a haunted island populated by the subhuman beasts known as the ""goons"".

Enough said. Just BUY it so more can come!",1189123200,3,3231,5.005586592178771

These are the Popeye cartoons that I remember as a kid, and they are still remarkably entertaining today. The quality of the transfers is superb, and some of the extra material is top-notch. I say ""some"" because there were some very poor choices made in the selecting of commentators and people to interview. In some cases they get downright annoying, and often say things like ""look at that!"" with a tone of surprise and enthusiam that seems to indicate they really weren't that familiar with the cartoon they were commenting on. Also, among the extras are a great many silent cartoons from the makers of Popeye... and by silent, I mean literally. This is not how they would have been presented, and some tastfully chosen or scored music would have been helpful. Watching them with dead quiet really does them a disservice. But these quibbles aside, if you come to smell the Popeye, you won't be disappointed.

We now get to see stunning new prints of such classics as ""KING OF THE MARDI GRAS"", ""PROTEC THE WEAKEREST"", ""STRONG TO THE FINICH"", ""SEASON'S GREETINKS"" (and the other Holiday follow-up in which Olive Oyle's Grandma joins in the fun and proves that spinach can suddenly envigorate old bones to dancin'), and let's not forget the POPEYE featurettes, now beautifully restored with original titles and credits, the way folks saw 'em in theaters upon official release!

The commentary tracks are just as wonderful as the cartoons, especially those by ""REN & STIMPY"" creator John Kricfalusi and toon historian, Jerry Beck.  This is a first volume of the history of a studio that gets very little recognition anymore, and this is perhaps the most successful series that the particular studio (Max Fleischer Studios of New York City) had to offer, first introduced as part of their BETTY BOOP series.

There is something so wonderfully surreal about these cartoons, sometimes even mixing in with live action antics, as in ""THE ADVENTURES OF POPEYE THE SAILOR"" which focuses more on a little boy who is seen in live action getting bullied by a tough kid.  It is every little boy's fantasy as his cartoon hero comes to the rescue and shows him clips of earlier films that prove why the character was so popular in his day and still remains in the minds of current generations.  Even the packaging of this one proves that this is a volume of animation history that the whole family can enjoy on all levels!  It neatly displays the development of the character and how a mere voice-over change can add new charm to Popeye, even at his roughest and toughest!",1188432000,4,2024,4.832369942196531

These B&W classics (two are in color--they were featurette cartoons-""Popeye Meets Ali Baba and The 40 Thieves"" and ""Popeye Meets Sinbad the Sailor"")look wonderful and were remastered from the best source material.

The extras are terrific as well. We get a number of Bray silent cartoons, 10 ""Out of the Inkwell"" cartoons plus 2 30 minute documentaries focusing on the creation of these cartoons. There's also a number of ""popumentaries"" focusing on the voice talents that gave life to these characters, the music of the Popeye cartoons, the color two-reelers and many other aspects of them as well.

The commentaries for thoese that are interested vary from terrific (Michael Barrier and Jerry Beck) to so-so (John Krichfalusi of ""Ren and Stimpy"" fame, Eddie Fitzgerald and Kali Fontecchio--not that they're bad they just aren't all that informative).

Note that this collection unlike the many cheapo budget compilations of much the same cartoons made from ex-TV and public domain prints is truly ""For the Adult Collector and may Not Be Suitable for Children""
These are the theatrical shorts COMPLETE even to the original credits - I've seen a few copies of the colour Fleischer specials (this set only has Ali Baba and Sindbad the Sailor... Aladdin was made after 1938)- some even in Black and White but I've never seen a print with all the credits and in such vibrant sparking colour.
The extras relate the movies and characters within to the original strip cartoons by Segar (and later by Sagendorf) and contrast the different ways the characters are used in still and moving drawings. They are interesting and merit repeated viewings. The commentaries where present also add to the enjoyment of the cartoons.

The 60 cartoons are remastered to a T. They look so good, you'll forget you'll even watching a set of mostly B&W cartoons. Also, the original opening/closing scenes are back. Say goodbye to A.A.P. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have the documentary on Fleischer Studios. I expect it to appear in Vol 2. Til then, get the bio ""Out Of The Inkwell: Max Fleischer And The Animation Revolution"" written by the late Richard Fleischer.

The rest of the special features like the 40+ minute long documentary on Popeye the Sailor is very interesting as are the 8 Popumentaries scattered thoughout this set. While the bonus silent films (including several Out of the Inkwell cartoons) are nice, they would have been better if they had music being played along.

And then there's the commentaries. While some from Jerry Beck, & Greg Ford were interesting others ain't as good with the Trio (John Eddie & Kali) being the worst, talking uttermost nonsense that has nothing to do with the cartoons itself. And what's this giving them the role of commentators on the 2-Color Two Reeler here?!

2807742,5,B000P296AS,"Finally, Popeye gets a DVD boxed set that is as robust as any can of Spinach he's ever eaten.  Very, very informative documentaries, commentaries by current animation producers, a large variety of pre-1930's short animation footage, and a great set of Popeye cartoons, of which many I hadn't seen before.

I really enjoyed watching ""A clean shaven man"", the ""Sindbad the sailor"" and ""Ali Baba's 40 thieves"" again, and there were several episodes I had never seen, which were very entertaining such as ""The spinach roadster.""  My favorite episode was ""I likes babies and infinks"" because the dialog is very witty while Bluto is pounding Popeye into various forms, and the ending has a surprise twist to it.

While watching the DVD's you also get an idea of how life was back in that time period-for example, room lights in a house typically had two push buttons-on and off, and not a single unified up/down switch like today, even though the mechanism is basically the same.  In a second example, Popeye walks up to a door, and doorbells had to be cranked manually-there wasn't a button that automatically ringed.  It should be noted that one of the reasons this cartoon has aged so well is because of Olive Oyl.  Why?  Back then, women had to still break certain stereotypes, such as women not being allowed on a sea-going ship because it was supposedly bad luck.  In ""Popeye The Sailor Meets Ali Baba's 40 Thieves"", Popeye tries to restrict Olive Oyl from being on the sea plane, but she goes anyway.  Olive Oyl has no problem using violence with Bluto in a couple of cartoons (she clubs him with a forest log in ""Shiver Me Timbers""), so she has 21st century mannerisms and an attitude despite being in the 1930's.

Something I really enjoyed about these Fleischer-produced cartoons was the background scrolling-it was a 3D-like multi-layered perspective effect (the farther away the background object, the slower it scrolled by), and not just a standard 2D flat background.  It was very nice to see most of the cartoons did this for the outdoor scenes, as Disney and Warner Brothers didn't put that much effort into their backgrounds.  Japanese Anime has multi-layered flat backgrounds, but the 3D stuff is mostly computer generated (animation cels plus computer graphics).

The tin box with an embossed Popeye on the front is a nice touch.  Warner Brothers has done Popeye justice with this release (even though Paramount produced the episodes).  You also learn a little more about Segar's vision with Popeye.

Watching Popeye combat over and over again might sound dull, but after Popeye powers up with spinach, when he gives his enemies a final punch, it's entertaining to see what they turn into.  I can't think of any other cartoon where the good guy consistently transforms the enemy by force into something else completely different upon defeat...

Even though I am not a big fan of forced commercials on a DVD, the Looney Tunes Volume 5 preview was fine on disc 4, since I'm going to buy that when it comes out in a few months anyway.",1187481600,8,3044,4.8080614203454894

I hope Betty Boop cartoons box set will be happening in the future. By the way, this Popeye set is without a doubt one of the best classic cartoon dvds ever. Don't miss this great collection.

2807750,4,B000P296AS,"The mighty, muttering mariner you all know and love has finally made shore leave on DVD.

That's right.  THE Popeye the Sailor is back and way better than ever with the very first 60 cartoons, circa 1933 to 1938 direct from the Fleischer Studios, on a brand-new 4-disc collection.  I like Popeye as much as the next animation buff and this set totally proves it.  Watch as his two strong arms pack a few punches that render the impossible, so to speak.  Whether you grew up with him way back when, or just got to know him, the spinach-loving sailor man is pretty cool back in his time.

These 60 classic episodes are remastered, restored, and unedited, too !  Join Popeye, his gal pal Olive Oyl, his rival Bluto, wee tyke Swee'Pea, burger-loving J. Wellington Wimpy, and a few other miscreants of the sailor's travels as they go head to head with one another and have a little fun, too.  All these adventures are back in their brilliant black-and-white format with the exception of two full-color episodes: the Academy Award nominee, ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor"" and ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves"".  You'll be rooting for him as he fights for honor, for glory, and (of course) for spinach !

Along with these 60 great cartoons is a big boatload of bonus features such as ""I Yam What I Yam: The Story of Popeye the Sailor"" and vignettes called ""Popeye Popumentaries"" like ""Sailor's Hornpipes: The Voices of Popeye"", ""Wimpy the Moocher: Ode to the Burgermeister"", ""Me Lil' Swee'Pea: Whose Kid Is He Anyway?"", ""Et Tu, Bluto?: Cartoondom's Heaviest Heavy"", and ""Me Fickle Goyl, Olive Oyl: The World's Least Likely Sex Symbol"".  Plus, select cartoons have commentaries by animators, actors, directors, and historians.  And another thing, more bonus features include silent cartoons from way back like ""Out of the Inkwell"" Shorts with Koko the Clown.  Very interesting.

Yes, this collectible set of Max Fleischer classic cartoons will be something to own if you're looking for something very vintage.  So watch.  Laugh.  Sing along if you like.  And I will probably suggest that you turn on the closed-captioning subtitles so you can make out the seaman's mumbling, if you wish.  Either way, enjoy this retrospective rally of cartoons which will be a treasure for generations to come.  You'll really enjoy the history involved as well.  And you may never eat spinach the same way again !

He is what he is and that's all what he is; he's strong to the finish 'cause he eats his spinach.  (Well, you get the idea.)  I certainly hope the rest of Popeye's cartoons will be out on DVD real soon.",1186704000,6,2622,4.775555555555556

Finally these Popeye cartoons can be seen and heard in all their original glory...highest marks for Warner's restoration department.  Some of the folks hav ecommented on the commentaries, but I cannot do so as they are not the reason I bought this box set.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful these 70 year old one-reelers (and the Technicolor two-reelers) look.  The 80+ year old ""Out of the Inkwell"" shorts look much worse, but we are lucky to have them in any form at all.  If you are an animation fan, grab these ASAP!",1186531200,14,631,4.648648648648648
2807752,5,B000P296AS,"Now THIS is the real Popeye, the Fleischer Bros version to me is unrivaled for having so much character and personality. The cleanup and restoration of both picture and sound is as good as it gets considering how old these are and the technology that produced them.

I always loved the mumbling and muttering (some HILARIOUS stuff nearly slips by unless you listen closely). And if  you pay attention, in certain cartoons, there's an abundance of 3-dimensional backgrounds that really give these cartoons a distinct look. Jack Mercer's voice for the anvil-armed sailor is the best by far, and the late Gus Wicke's portrayal of Bluto is one for the ages (I LOVED that laugh of his!). And boy, psychologists could have a field day dissecting the highly dysfunctional co-dependent relationship between Popeye and Olive Oyl(how could ANYONE be that fickle and superficial is beyond me, and what did Popeye see in her anyway?). I had to laugh at the disclaimers regarding stereotypes in the cartoons, being a product of their time and all.

It's a can't lose package, great cartoons, witty asides and muttering, hilariously old-fashioned music and the GREAT bonus material make for very enjoyable viewing as well as a look back at another age of American society altogether.

This truly is the real deal, and to me, the Popeye cartoons that came after this era were just never anywhere close to as great as these (th later ones lacked a lot of the charater and personality found here).

1. The cartoons are UNCUT.
2. The picture quality is GORGEOUS!
3. The sound quality is STUNNING!
4. I can understand what the characters are saying!
5. The cartoons are in chronological order. I can watch them get better and better right before my very EYES!
6. The drawings are beautifully done.
7. The animation is fluid, and wildly imaginative. DelightfuL!
8. Each cartoon has a completely different story.
9. Each cartoon has its own excellent musical score.
10. The characters even sing! (Lots of great songs here)
11. The backgrounds are works of art in themselves.
12. The restorations are wonderful.
13. The bonus stuff is great fun. (It was nice to see Popeye's voice, ""Jack Mercer"" talk about his role--also a photo of the original old sailor who inspired Popeye--looks just like him!)
14. The packaging is cool! I dig the pictures on the discs.
15. The PC disclaimer is not a nuisance.
When I first got my DVDs, I immediately went to ""Morning Noon and Night Club"" (one of my favorites, I haven't seen for 50 years!)  A bit of a surprise--my mistake--it just happens to be the one cartoon they didn't remaster! (Needs a lot of scratch removal...)

It's crisp, dynamic, and beautiful. What's even better is that the audio track has been cleaned up. I now understand *EVERY* word of the dialog and the songs of Ali Babba, whereas previously I was missing about 20%. I was excited when I heard about the restoration, but I had no idea what was coming!!

Also, the Fleisher Popeyes are fantastic cartoons! They are tons of great quips, visual gags, and great songs throughout them. I grew up with the later Popeyes, and had no idea why people liked them. Now that I've found the original Segar strips, and the Fleisher toons, I understand why Popeye was the biggest animated star of his time.",1186272000,5,856,4.74496644295302

The transfers are brilliant, even on a 1080p monitor ... though I sez they should be watched on a 19 inch B&W Emerson, each weekday around 4pm or so. With some Bosco and cookies.
The Fleischers had such detail in comparison with other B&W's of that era. Warner Bros. and Disney don't even come close, especially with the 3-D turntable backgrounds. And you can hear every memorable Mercer mumble!

Especially the two Technicolor two-reel Popeye specials! I have never seen them in their original form with their original Paramount opening and closing titles until buying this set. The restoration job on these (as well as all the B/W Popeyes) are terrific, and have all the look and feel of 1930s Technicolor cartoons where seemingly every color in the spectrum was used in designing them. I think the restoration of the Technicolor specials to their original glory is reason alone to buy this set! The spoken commentaries on the various cartoons, you can take 'em or leave 'em. The only thing I found disappointing is the several silent cartoons included have no musical accompaniment of any kind with them. If it were up to me, I'd have some acoustically-recorded 78-rpm jazz and dance-band music from the late 1910s and 1920s to accompany the silent 'toons.

The films look and sound really good and, they don't have that silly A.A.P. logo on them. (That was put on when the cartoons were sold for early TV broadcast.) This is the very first official release and I am glad it has finally arrived. Some nice and informative extras have also been put in. (example: You get to find out where Swee'pea came from.) These are cartoons the way they were meant to be. My only complaint is that the additional bonus cartoons from the silent era should have had, at least, a tinkling piano score added to them.

2807760,5,B000P296AS,"This is, without a doubt, one of the very best DVD sets I have EVER purchased... and I own the new Droopy and Woody Woodpecker sets, as well as the 4 previous Looney Tunes collections, the great Batman animated series sets, and many many others, so this isn't exaggeration on my part!

The Fliescher Studio (sp?) Popeye shorts are some of my all-time favorite cartoons... as a kid, I owned a lot of the cheap 3rd - or - 4th - generation VHS tapes made by companies like Castle Cartoons that had only a few Popeye shorts on each, rounding each tape out to around 30 minutes. So to have this set, the complete shorts from 1933-1938, is amazing and worth every penny to purchase.

The remasters are, as you'll read in other customer reviews, ASTOUNDING.  If all companies took this much love and care to remaster the picture AND sound of their classic cartoons, maybe ALL DVD sets would be this good.  ""Popeye Meets Sindbad The Sailor"" looked decent on my old 1980's VHS tape... but here, it's like watching a painting come to life.  When other customers are saying that these cartoons look amazing, they are NOT lying!!

I don't care at all about special features in my DVD sets... but this one, as one previous customer already noted, is ""an embarrasment of riches""... and they're right!  The 2 documentaries (the history of Popeye, and the story of the birth of animation) are incredibly focused and full of information about the world of classic animation.  Even the commentaries are wonderful, especially the cartoons commentated on by John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren And Stimpy).

I urge any and all Popeye fans to buy this... throw out all those crummy Dollar Store DVDs and olf VHS tapes from the 70's and 80's and GET THIS, no matter what the price!  And if you're an animation buff... the special features include historically significant shorts starring Mutt and Jeff, Felix The Cat, Koko The Clown, and Krazy Kat.. plus a bunch of the classic ""From The Inkwell"" shorts.

2807761,4,B000P296AS,"YAHOO!  These are the original cartoons, restored so you can
actually -see- the action and the detailed scenery.  The
Fleischer's use of the turntable to hold scenery appeared in
a lot more cartoons than I remembered it did--  possibly due
to the re-tracings I've heard of over the years.
.
I didn't remember just how much the voices were part of the
action-- great voices, and they all -sang-!  And there was a
lot of singing in those early cartoons.
.
And violence.  Popeye vs Bluto (NOT Brutus!).
And lots of punches flying.  The back of the box says ""Not
for children.""  Well, I saw these as a 'child,' and I think
I turned out pretty good in spite of the violence, stereotypes,
and insulting dialog.
.
And they re-released 2 of the 3 color two-reelers!  WHOO-HOO!
They are magnificent!  Then snakes on Sindbad's island are
actually -green-!  And the bird is -blue-!  None of the
releases I've seen are from anything close to the original
Technicolor negatives!  Amazing what you can do with the
original material!
.
The only thing that prevents this from receiving a 5-star rating
are the commentaries.  They include what can best be described
as ""a giggling schoolgirl.""  And the 3 member commentary team
giggles along.  And many of the commentaries are not as
informative as those on the Looney Tunes collections.
.
Somewhere in my collection is a short subject- ""Making of a Popeye
Cartoon,"" that describes the turntable used for the unique 3-D
effect.  This was not included in the collection (but may appear
in later volumes).
.
Overall, a wonderful collection.  I can't wait for the next
volumes!  The two-reelers alone make the collection worth it!

For me, 1930's cartoons in general were wackier and more off the wall than the carefully scripted cartoons we have had in the last few decades. This one ranks on a par with the great Looney Tunes box sets that are currently available. What makes these even more precious is that they have seldom been seen since the 50's or 60's. When i was a kid, these were on all the time. But lately we were sold old VHS colorized in poor quality at bargain bins. These are outstanding in quality and also in character. This is the real funny Popeye, also a brilliant bully of a Bluto, fat, mean, lecherizing over skinny Olive Oyl, and not the refined Brutus of later years. Plus there are many bizarro characters in them. These cartoons looked like they came out yesterday in quality.

Like the best early Mickey shorts, these Popeye cartoons are truly entertaining and funny, with boundless energy and many creative gags. Whether you're a classic animation fan or just someone looking for something different, here are five reasons you should buy this set:

1. All of the cartoons are from Popeye's original Fleischer Bros. incarnation, when the series had its most cockamamie characters (including the Sailor Man in all his gruffy, mumbling glory), cockeyed plots, fluid animation and detailed backgrounds.

2. The shorts are the original, black-and-white, uncut versions, fully restored from the master negatives and never before made available to the public.

3. Unlike the more familiar 1950-1960s Popeye cartoons, these don't all have the same plot! Yes, Bluto tries to kiss Olive Oyl in a couple, but otherwise the stories on this set jump all over the place. In one (""Lost and Foundry""), Baby Swee'pea saves Popeye and Olive from being crushed.

4. Each disc comes with a full slate of extras, including documentaries, featurettes and rare bonus cartoons, most of which are early silent films and ten of which star Koko the Clown. Altogether there are more than five hours of bonus features.

5. Ten cartoons have audio commentaries, featuring film and animation experts such as Jerry Beck and Leonard Maltin.

 Cartoons(save for WB's Looney Tunes)simply don't get any better. Let the young 'uns see what a REAL cartoon is......GET THIS BOX SET!!!",1185753600,3,206,5.4375
2807772,5,B000P296AS,"When I first read the press release of the new Popeye The Sailor 1933-1938 Volume 1 Collection from Warner Home Video I thought it would be ""interesting"". Now that I;ve seen it, I can say it's a landmark production and essential viewing for anyone interested in animated films or cartoons.

It's not just that the cartoons included  - 58 of them from the EARLY years - are the really funny Fleischer Studios versions using great prints and transfers but, hidden in this set, are over 5 hours of ""bonus materials"" including a 45minute plus documentary on the whole history of Popeye cartoons and another 30 minute one on the Animated film from 1900-1920 including interviews with many experts as well as folks like Ray Harryhausen. There are also shorter 10 minute ones on The Music of Popeye, Wimpy the hamburger aficionado. There was one titled ""Max Fleisher and the New York Style"" which must have been deleted after the initail press release. It is not in final package, Maybe they'll add to Vol. 2. There's also  lots of commentaries for the shorts which gave me a background on them. I think every MAJOR cartoon or animation expert was consulted. The Package is not cheap but the quality is really up there. I'm not sure when Volume 2 will be out, but it will sure be hard to top this one!

2807773,5,B000P296AS,"Folks, buy this set now. Don't hesitate, just buy it.  In a word, this set is absolutely outstanding!  I had tried the Thunderbean DVD earlier that contained a few public domain titles and, quite frankly, thought I had outgrown Popeye.  I was able to view this new set from Warners, and let me tell you, these cartoons are great!  For adults and kids alike.  They're very funny & entertaining, with fun music & great gags and very likable, classic characters.  This is some of the best cartoons ever produced.  The picture quality is also amazing on these shorts.  Don't mess with any other Popeye DVD--this is the one to get, trust me.  Volume 2 is due out next year and I can't wait!  It even makes me want to eat my spinach!",1185580800,6,727,4.4393939393939394

The Fleischer Brothers Studios (Max & Dave) not only pioneered, developed, and perfected animation, but lovingly created the finest, most fluid, most meticulously rendered cartoon character animations in the history of the industry. Of all the Fleischer Brothers' many masterworks, 'Popeye The Sailor' was and IS the acknowledged creme de la creme! Warner Studios deserves the undying gratitude of all TRUE Fleischer Popeye fans. A thousand cheers for Warner Studios and all their gifted digital remastering craftsmen! When and only when they have returned ALL the great vintage Popeye episodes (DVD volumes 1,2, et al, especially the Fleischer and early Paramount Studios' work) to their original clarity and brilliance can I be happily transmuted to that great Fleischer Studio in the sky.",1183680000,11,1365,6.423913043478261
2807775,5,B000P296AS,"I have waited for this release for a long time.....As I have worked in Television, I had a few of these from ""Master"" copies lying in the Vault of some of the facilities I have worked at. I still have the 2 3/4"" tapes
(this was BEFORE VHS and Betamax) This is when only ""people in the biz"" had their own 3/4"" VTR's (anybody remember the ""Columbo"" episode with Bill Shatner that used his 3/4 as a murder alibi?) This is the one release that I and many,many others have been waiting for. Alot of us are in for some great hours of memories. (Sinbad, with real colors!!!

8188403,5,B000P296AS,"The BEST cartoons EVER made. I grew up watching these as a kid and the DVDs have great features involving character and studio history,art work, and other commentaries by artists and animators. Don't be fooled by the later 1950's and later Popey cartoons which are regurgitations of the old studio, this is ""the real deal"".Politically,racially and socially incorrect as well as stereotypical. NO ONE makes cartoons like this today and none would dare. I watched Popey religiously as a young 5-6 year old and it didn't have any negative effects on me, but other parents may not wish to have their child watch these. These cartoons are completely nostalgic for me and Popey has always been one of my favorites. If you remember the old B&W Popey cartoons as I do, this DVD collection is worth more its weight in gold and is well worth the purchase.",1497916800,2,845,4.755102040816326

8188407,3,B000P296AS,"I bought this for nostalgia - lots of Popeye cartoons ran on TV when I was a child.  For what it is, it is VERY beautifully produced - tons of cartoons clearly transferred, and fascinating early animation bonuses (variety of full cartoons from the silent era), bonuses alone worth the price.  But this is NOT your best starter set to acquaint young children with old cartoons.  The continual fistfights and violence to resolve problems gets old for me, and the alternatives (Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Betty Boop) are just as creative and more lighthearted and diverse in their situations and story lines, IMHO.",1489449600,,610,4.902912621359223
