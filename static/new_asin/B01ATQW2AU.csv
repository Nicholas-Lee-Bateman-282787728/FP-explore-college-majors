8748438,5,B01ATQW2AU,"As a fan of both Robert Addie and Kipling's book, I have wanted to see this series for years, back when it was still completely unavailable in any form. Having bought it at long last, and with a program downloaded onto my computer that allows me to watch UK format DVDs, I was half afraid to watch it, lest it should disappoint. I needn't have worried; I loved every second of it! My only quibble is that many of the actors are obviously much older than the boys in the book really would have been, but since I never would have even heard about the series if not for Addie (22 at the time that Stalky would have been 15-16), I can hardly regret that. I only wish that there had been more episodes!",1515628800,,697,4.208955223880597

I first read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalky-Co/dp/1481910965/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalky & Co.</a>&nbsp;in middle school, and it was like a Victorian X-men.  The novel collects the nine best short stories (out of fourteen) of a trio of outsiders who nonetheless exert immense influence at their school by virtue of brains, cunning, and generally being ""cool"".  Critics in 1899 and since have complained that Stalky, M'Turk, and Beatle are cynical, or even monstrous, in their disdain for the norms of the school.  Perhaps.  Kipling didn't sugar-coat the brutality which lay under the efforts of a Victorian public school to turn ""savages"" into young men suitable for administering the British Empire.  Stalky and his friends deeply want to become ""men of valor and achievement"" but are skeptical that following the rules is the path to that goal.

The six episodes (In Ambush, Slaves of the Lamp, An Unsavory Interlude, The Moral Reformers, A Little Prep, and The Last Term) are well-done character studies of the three, sticking fairly closely to the text.  Stalky is ""born for the Army"", witty, the strategist of the trio, and a bit dangerous. Robert Addie perfectly encompasses the role. M'Turk is a country gentlemen in the making.  And Beatle, a self-portrait of Kipling, is insecure but a budding literary light.  The backgrounds and costuming are up to the BBC's high standards.

Keep in mind the original stories were written in the heyday of the Victorian period -- corporal punishment at school was taken for granted, as were class distinctions which have been less and less acceptable since the end of WW I.  I truly enjoyed the dramatization of a long-time favorite, but I am sooo glad I wasn't sent to one of these schools as a child.",1491091200,2,1987,5.171875
8748440,5,B01ATQW2AU,"This was a marvelous series, appearing in the USA through a cooperative agreement between the Beeb and the A&E channel, back when A&E took its name seriously.  Long believed to have been lost, like so much other of the BBC's programs of that era, I hope it becomes available for Region 1 players!",1471910400,,296,4.584905660377358
