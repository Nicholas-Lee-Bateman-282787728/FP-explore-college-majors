640470,2,6303422853,"I might have just been expecting more from this, but I was very disapointed in this movie.  It was placed under ""Comedy"" at the video store, and I can't imagine why.  Some scenes were funny, but only  some.  Most of the film was slow, and tried too hard to be romantic.  Perhaps I should see it again, but I'm afraid that I'll just end of  disliking it even more.  Other people really liked it, so perhaps it is  just me, and maybe the film really is great.  But I personally liked TRUST  and AMATEUR, two other Hartley films, much more than this one.",938736000,,551,4.262135922330097
640471,5,6303422853,"I was stunned by Simple Men: simply one of my top ten favorite movies.  The last scene ranks up there with Sean Penn's Indian Runner, the Cohen Brother's Miller's Crossing, and, of course, La Femme Nikita.  There ARE  contemporary films that transcend the genre--like those I've just listed,  and including Fresh, The Last Emporer, and Raise the Red Lantern.  Simple  Men is among the top.",931910400,,389,4.907692307692308
640533,5,6303422853,"Hal Hartley never fails to entertain, never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level.  Simple Men is no exception.  The seemingly simple plot - two brothers in search of their missing dad - provides so much room for character growth that I wish there were an entire series of films centered around them.

With a hard-edged view of the world as: ""There's no such thing as adventure. There's no such thing as romance. There's only trouble and desire"" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920's) there's plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley's ambivalent theories.

Simple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena Lwensohn.  In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50's beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth's ""Kool thing.""  Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number.

Many dismiss this film, and Hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point.  What is amazing about Hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that, once seen, reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane.

Simple Men is pure cinematic delight.

Hooray for Hartley!",1119312000,18,1238,4.769953051643192
640534,5,6303422853,"A few years ago I was looking for some movie in TV when in wrong move I put one of this channels you never watch cos the quality of the image is bad and the movies are in my spoken languaje (spanish, I prefer with subtitles). I don't remember what scene but I remember the face of Robert John Burke from Robocop III, talking some very clever dialogues. After just a few minutes I couldn't change the channel till the movie ends leaving me absolutely impress.
  Just a few weeks later by the same reason I catch ""Trust"" and from this same moment I became fan of Hal Hartley.
  Why?
  Because after years watching more than one hundred different movies of any style and director, Simple men and the rest of the Hartley's work show me another vision of life and another way to make movies, thinking more in a good and very deep script with a few good actors than a good budget with great special effects.
  It reminds me the movies of Terrence Malick, because in the chaos of the existence both directors show the path of the real survivors, not those guys who are born to be heroes, just those one only wanna some moment of peace and true love, that's it's more than all the glory of the universe.",1076371200,15,1195,4.327354260089686
640535,5,6303422853,"For all you Hal Hartley fans who have desired having a copy of Simple Men on DVD,  your time has come.  Simple Men will be released on DVD widescreen format January 27, 2004.  I can't wait to get my copy!!!",1071705600,3,206,4.1
640536,5,6303422853,"When i bought my DVD player two years ago, I was desperate not to find the three first movies from Hal Hartley. Those are my absolute cult movies with a couple a Takeshi Kitano movies. I hope that ""Trust"" (my favourite) will also be available very soon... Thanks to whoever is responsible for this !!",1069804800,4,300,4.472727272727273
640537,5,6303422853,"This is one brilliant film and, like some other reviewers, I must say that it is my favorite film ever.  Contrary to other reviewers, I would not dismiss the plot.  The plot of two young men, one an ""experienced"" criminal and one an ""innocent"" student, searching for their ""heroic"" but ""outlawed"" father, is fundamentally mythic, in a way necessarily ironized by the beautiful paradoxes of the film's characters:  the older brother's ultimate innocence in his rawness, the young brother's sophistication in his cool rationality -- perhaps most powerfully, the revelation of the father as disappointingly banal and extremely self-absorbed.  (A scene near the end in which he reads aloud from a rebellious manifesto of Count Malatesta and has everyone around him repeat the words in unison brings this out in the film's most keenly satirical moment.)  Every single character embodies the simultaneous pain and joy of life in an unusually poignant way -- and, by the way, Karen Sillas's performance as Kate is heartrendingly compelling in this regard.
A feature of Hartley's ingenious conception is the juxtaposition of two sharply opposing genre elements.  The dialogue is stylized and beautifully rhythmic, very much in the tradition of modern stage drama -- Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Sam Shepherd, John Guare.  But the cinematography -- far from ""washed out"" as one reviewer says -- is rich, with beautiful compositions, dynamic angles, and gorgeous colors in a poignantly bare East Long Island landscape.  Thus the dialogue tends toward abstract and stylized art, the cinematography toward realistic or naturalistic representation.  The dialogue is ""theatrical,"" the cinematography ... ""cinematic.""  This tension brings out the ironies in the plot and characters, so that every aspect of this work of art corresponds to its overall theme.  At every moment, the viewer is simultaneously quite absorbed in the emotional turmoil of the characters and their plot-driven pursuits, while also ironically hanging back and viewing the whole as something of a caricature of ""the mythic plot"" or ""the telling character.""  It is this play of irony and emotional engagement that makes _Simple Men_ a crowning achievement of art and one that should far outlast its own time.
I should mention that performances of subordinate figures are also quite splendid, including those of the police chief, the auto mechanic's assistant, the Catholic high school girl who helps the younger brother find the address that goes with the phone number, and even the security guard at the beginning.  None of these actors are named in the Editor's Review, so I don't know who they are.
I very much hope that this film will come out in DVD to help ensure the shelf life of its physical medium that its artistry deserves.",1042243200,8,2794,5.195991091314031
640538,5,6303422853,"Seriously, I love this movie.  This and Trust are my two favorite Hartley movies.  I think it's criminal that they are not available on DVD. To me the dialogue is absolutely true (not to mention hysterical) in a completely different way than I've ever seen done by any other filmmaker, plus the deadpan delivery just cracks me up. I can't even really do it justice, you need to see it for yourself.  However - be warned, if your idea of a quality flick is one directed by Tom Green, you will not appreciate the subtle charms of this movie. If you have half a brain, however, you should be able to get into Hartley's strange but ultimately satisfying groove.

640539,4,6303422853,"Hal Hartley's ultra clever, purposely stylized, dialogue driven ""Simple Men"" seems like an exercise in clever wordplay. The characters appear to be mainly props or mouthpieces for Hartley's witty and caustic repartee. If that was all there was to this perceptive film, one could admire the words but dismiss the film as one would a puppet show. Paying close attantion to what is being said, however, will reveal that the film has great heart and depth and is a mediatation on relationships and the pain of lost love.
Two brothers are on the trail of their outlaw, left-over-from-the sixties- radical, father. Along the way, a multitude of serious subjects from politics to sexual exploitation of women to the nature of right and wrong are humorously bantered about by the characters. What truly drives these characters, however, is their utter loss to explain why their relationships constantly fail and cause them so much pain and heartache. The sheriff sums up most of the characters' feelings in a brilliant, stream of consciousness, monologue and says that ""love is like sticking an ice pick through your forehead...Why do I do it?""
Hartley's question is what most of us have asked ouselves after a failed relationsship. Why do we keep coming back for more when the result is always pain? One is reminded of a similar theme and question in Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"".  The answer, of course, is that we need it no matter what the cost; just like we need original filmakers like Hal Hartley who are willing to experiment, take risks and present ideas in innovative and creative ways.",1014508800,3,1586,4.917910447761194
640540,5,6303422853,"First thing's first, Hal Hartley's films will probably never be everyone's ""cup of tea."" That said, he is one of the most gifted film-makers to emerge in the past decade or so. In the same year that yielded such wonderful American movies as ""Bob Roberts,"" ""The Player,"" and ""Night on Earth,"" ""Simple Men"" stands tall as a wonderful contribution to world cinema.
In an interview, Hartley once said that he disputed people saying he wasn't a traditional fim-maker. He argued that he was a traditional film-maker, but that his tradition was people like Bertolt Brecht and Andy Warhol. Evolving from that (alternative) tradition, Hartley is a master of understatement, both as a writer and a director. Because of this, he is often able to reveal simple truths with more emotional impact than many more superficially passionate films. While some of his subsequent films have been more ambitious (and in some ways even better) than this one, ""Simple Men"" is the one that sticks with me like no other.
The film is many things: a road movie, a quest, a love story. It begins as a bookish and somewhat naive son's quest to learn the truth about his father (a noted short-stop and political fugitive). He is accompanied by his older brother, who joins his quest for more material reasons. The quest takes them to a place which feels both completely concrete yet somehow divorced from reality. In this place, the younger brother learns a great deal more about life, while the older brother discovers depths of feeling and commitment within himself that he never imagined he had.
Trying to give a literal description of this film's plot would do it an injustice, because that plot is ultimately a means to explore the intriguing characters who make their way through it. Suffice it to say that after watching it, you will be surprised at how moving this film is and how honest it is about the relationships which bind men and women together.",984441600,12,1929,4.813253012048193

I have been unable to track down  the latter, but was happy to find more Hartley films available.  I believe  fans of 'Repo Man' and 'Clerks' would be very pleased with 'Simple Men'.

7846038,1,6303422853,"Two brothers go on a road-trip to find their on-the-lam anarchist father and in the process meet an assortment of odd characters.

""Simple Men"" is possibly the most pretentious films I have ever seen. I watched this film to the end in the hope of finding something that resembled a plot but was sorely disappointed. All that happened was a bunch of characters, that I cared very little about, said a lot of things that I think were intended to be deep and profound but which I found to be meaningless.

This is not my first Hal Hartley film. I had previously seen ""Henry Fool"", which I loved. However, whereas ""Henry Fool"" actually had something to say (and was pretty funny too), ""Simple Men"" is just pretentious drivel. If you must watch one of Hartley's films, watch ""Henry Fool"" instead.",1211068800,,791,4.642857142857143
7846039,5,6303422853,"Hal Hartley's best films are intellectual candy.  They are full of provocations and delights, little moments that are both enigmatic and profoundly simple and true.  This one is my favorite, at least so far.  Two men on a search for their father, who may or may not be guilty of a profound wrong or disastrous mistake.  Two women waiting for something or someone.  In outline, the basic plot sounds like any number of Hollywood dramas or romantic comedies, but in this film there is something so fresh about the dialogue with its musical punctuation and simple but unique staging.  The style he employs here, of characters speaking like they were in a soap opera -- not quite acting but emoting and standing as mouthpiece for a play of ideas that is tied to the action -- works when it is subtle and simple as it is in this film (and in others like Henry Fool).  Taken to an extreme it can become a bit annoying, as in Fay Grim which feels just too big and unwieldy to work.  Here it is just right, and at just the right moments is broken by absurdly funny set pieces like a spontaneous musical outburst in response to the Sonic Youth or a cigarette-smoking nun who assaults a police officer.  Hartley is the closest we have to an American Godard.  Definitely a keeper.",1180656000,,1269,4.502183406113537
7846040,3,6303422853,"I won't speak to the joys of this movie...others have done so here much more eloquently than I ever could. I will, however, note that there are a few technical aspects of this dvd that bothered me. First is the aspect ratio. Hal Hartley is a master at framing a shot, and there are many times in this release that his framing is ruined, because the top or bottom is lopped off. There are also scenes in which a mood was set using dark, heavily tinted light. Thanks to (I assume) automated conversion to dvd, those scenes have been altered so they appear to take place in nice, bland sunlight.

I won't go as far as recommend against buying the disc...the movie is excellent. But you should be aware that some small part of what made this such a wonderful movie has been lost.",1154304000,,775,4.381944444444445
