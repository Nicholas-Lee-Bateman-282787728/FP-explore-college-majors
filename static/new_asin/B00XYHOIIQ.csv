7203733,3,B00XYHOIIQ,"The actual show and dubbing in this release is actually quite good. The English cast captures the spirit of the original Japanese case perfectly. All the lines delivered sounded genuine. My main complaints are for the actual DVD quality that Warner Brothers put out. I'm glad we finally got an official Jojo's dub and release, but I would have liked the option for a Blu-ray version. The picture quality here is lackluster and isn't in the best resolution. It's passable, but the show can look much better than what this release gives. Also, the menus are downright embarrassing. The main menu is accompanied with stock background music (not from the show), generic icons (TVs for episodes, continent for languages), and the image for the menu is the front cover, which is fine, but it's out of resolution.

Again, amazing show and dub, but terrible DVD quality. This is all we have for now though if you don't wanna watch the series on Crunchyroll. For those of you wondering the original subbed version is also in the release, so you have that option as well. I hope if Warner Brothers brings over Part 3 of this series they up their game with the product quality.",1443571200,16,1166,4.715686274509804
7203734,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"I normally don't care for anime but JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the greatest thing I have ever seen! However on this particular product, the DVD quality is meh and the menus are ghetto, like generic template from the trial version of Roxio menu maker ghetto lol. Anyway, I hope they keep this series going but release in 1080p HD B.R. because I am hooked.

If you don't think you'll like this anime, you're just like I was before I watched this show... don't judge it off some random YouTube clips, you can't get into it or get a good feel for it, it's seriously amazing though. It has serious action/adventure, blood/gore, comedy/humor, and a great backstory with dramatic/suspenseful moments.

Also check out JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle for an epic top-tier PS3 fighting game. Cheers.",1443225600,3,800,4.875
7203735,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"I need to start off by saying that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of my all time anime/manga series.  It is an amazing series with fantastic stories, characters, and battles.  If you get the chance to read or watch the series, I highly recommend you do so.

That being said, this DVD set is absolutely terrible.  I am not basing this review on the quality of the series, but the quality of the physical product.  WB decided to slap together a DVD to profit on the growing Jojo fandom.  This DVD set is nearly bootleg quality, hell, I've seen bootlegs with higher quality picture than this.  The menus even looked like something you would by from a random stall in Chinatown.  I don't know why they didn't just invest in putting some quality in a Blu-Ray set.  Even if they charged double the price for it, I would have thrown my money at them in the blink of an eye.  It's just a shame that I feel like I wasted my money on something I could have easily seen for free on a malware filled streaming site, same quality and all.

If you want to support the western release of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, go ahead and purchase this set like I did.  If you want to support the series and get a high quality product, go and purchase the hardback manga release of Phantom Blood, and soon to be Battle Tendancy.  All 3 volumes are the same price and you will feel like you helped yourself as well as the series.",1443052800,80,1402,4.325670498084291
7203736,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"Honestly, one of the very best anime of recent years that accurately depicts one of the most influential Shounen Manga of all time. This 3 disc set contains Part I Phantom Blood and Part II Battle Tendency. The picture quality is very good and the sound is clear on both the English and Japanese Audio Tracks. However, one quirk is that subtitles for the Japanese track need to be opened using your remote rather than the menu. Also included is a Spanish subtitle track. The acting quality of the English Dubbed voice actors is also surprisingly good, though Patrick Seitz is not quite on par with Takehito Koyasu,. This is a series that is a good introduction to the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure stories and will be enjoyed by both longtime and new anime fans.",1442966400,,757,4.656716417910448

7203739,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"One of the best dubs I've heard in a while. The localization writing is spectacular and the voice actors get the personalities down pretty well, especially Joseph. For many of them you can tell they studied how the Japanese voice actors delivered their lines so they could approach the characters in a similar way. Some of the accents are goofy and over-the-top, but that suits JJBA just fine, because that's what the whole anime is. Goofy and over-the-top. Glad to see it's getting dubbed.",1438819200,3,490,4.845238095238095
7203740,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"First off, I started watching JoJo last summer as a sort of ""we have no idea what this is about, let's watch it"" with my friend. Watching g this again this summer was like nostalgia. But I digress.

This is possibly one of the best anime dubs I have seen. Part 1 improves upon the original sub by adding 150% more English mannerisms, fitting the setting, as well as just being a general quality dub. Granted, I only watched the first three episodes of Part 1, and I've heard Part 2's dub isn't as good. That being said, this is still a quality dub and I would highly suggest checking out Part 3's dub if/when it comes out (I'm pretty sure it is coming out, the first three episodes have been done.)",1438819200,,698,4.287878787878788

7203742,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"Only 3 DVDs?! That's absurd. There are too many episodes crammed into these DVDs, the quality will be even more inferior to that of a regular DVD, not to mention this should have been released on Blu-ray. The color in the DVDs are all silver, even though one of the most notable and amazing things about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is how colorful it is. $50 dollars? This should be priced at $22.48 exactly. I can't help it but feel taken advantage of if I buy this set. They went all-out cheap with this set. They clearly don't care about this series, so I ask myself, why didn't they just give it to Viz Media? As a fan and someone who wants to support this series, I completely understand if you would want to buy this, but I just thought I'd let you know if you didn't what you're in store for.",1432166400,6,796,4.2781456953642385

The animation is amazing, each fight is an unique spectacular, and the voice acting is believable and realistic. In the original japanese version everyone had a japanese accent, but in this dub the characters have accents of the country their from. The show takes place in Britain so most characters have british accents and speak with British dialect. I already saw this season on crunchy and it's like watching for the first time again.

7203753,4,B00XYHOIIQ,"The show itself: I found this to be a pretty fun show to watch. The narrative of this season is broken up into two parts the first being the phantom blood arc that begins the bizarre adventures of the joestar family with Johnathon and the second arc is called battle tendency which picks up decades after the first and has the grandson of Johnathon, Joseph, fighting against an ancient evil that is responsible for the events of the first arc. This show has a good story, great action scenes, good comedy, and a great cast of characters to help keep it going; although the pacing can be off in both the first and second arcs. Also keep in mind that this show can get weird, like nazi cyborg's fighting super vampires levels of weird,  in the second half. The overall aesthetic of the show is great with good uses of color and has good character designs. The music is pretty good, not much else to say about that. Also I found the dub to be pretty good for the most part since all characters seemed to have appropriate voices, except Johnathon who probably should have been voiced by someone with a deeper voice. If you are unsure if you want to watch this I would suggest getting a digital copy of the first volume of the phantom blood arc like I did, it's about $6.00, and if you like what you see get this series on dvd.
The DVD:It's bare bones with no extras. All it has are the option to marathon episodes, episode selection, language options, etc. Be warned though the episode selection forces you to sit through the entire sets credits after each episode and boots you back to the menu. The quality of the video is good, although I watched in standard definition so watching it in HD might give off a different quality. The packaging was lackluster, I felt it would be prone to scratching up the discs because of how cheap it is like many other multi disc releases I have gotten recently, I would suggest keeping the discs in a holder. Overall I do not have much problem with the menu presentation since I bought this so I could watch the show in english and really don't care if the dvd menus look like they're from a bootleg.",1468713600,,2133,4.413705583756345
7203754,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"JoJo is one of the greatest series of all time and it's long-awaited debut in the USA is finally here! However, Warner Brothers thought they could get away with this horrid excuse of a media release. For those uninformed, this is what you'll receive with this package:

- All 26 episodes from the first season of JoJo, but in pretty bad quality due to being squeezed onto DVDs.
- A main menu that looks like it was made by a college student on their lunch break using Windows Movie Maker. It's horrible to look at, trust me.
- No special features. At all.
- No official subtitles, as the English subtitles follow the dubbed script instead of the original Japanese script.
- An English dub, which is actually pretty good and done by A-list voice actors in the anime industry. Still, a few characters give cringe-worthy accents.

Now, DO NOT buy this if you're wanting to get into JoJo or support the series! VIZ Media announced they will be re-releasing the entire JoJo series on Blu-Ray with tons of extra goodies. So instead, wait until the Fall when they most likely plan to release it. The 1-Star review is for the quality of the packaging alone, the series itself is easily 5-stars so check it out~!",1468108800,13,1203,4.564814814814815
7203755,5,B00XYHOIIQ,Heard a lot of good things about this series and after my last anime convention I decided to give a watch from the beginning. Definitely didn't not regret buying this nor does it disappoint with the action & humor!,1467849600,3,214,4.512820512820513
7203756,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"Anyone remember the disappointment that was the initial DVD release for Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence? Lack of an English Dub, limited special features, and subtitles that included sound cues for the hearing impaired? This, of course, was the result Dreamworks, the film's Western distributor, having no idea what they were doing when it came to localizing anime. Thankfully, Bandai Entertainment rectified this problem a few years later when they gave the film a proper release with two English dubs (one done in the UK and one done by the English cast of Stand Alone Complex), plenty of special features, and proper subtitles which even went as far as translating the musical chorals.

Now you may wonder why I'm talking about this in a review for a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure DVD. Because this sad excuse for a release is a good example of why major film companies need to leave anime to the people who know how to do anime, because they have clearly demonstrated that they have no idea what the Hell they are doing. Now unlike Ghost in the Shell 2, this film does have an English dub from Viz Media. Honestly, this dub is a good example of the hit-or-miss nature of Viz's dubs, with some good moments from Patrick Seitz as Dio and an earnest attempt from Johnny Yong Bosch to TRY to sound British and break way from his usual typecasted rolls, overall this can be chalked up as another miss on Viz's part. Unfortunately, the dub is pretty much going to be your only option when watching the show on this DVD. Oh the original Japanese audio track is included on the DVD, but unless you speak Japanese, you're out of luck, because not only do the subtitle tracks only served a captions for the English dub, it's captions for the hearing impaired, meaning every single sound effect is described in the subtitles. Oh, and did I mention the horrid quality of the subtitles? Yeah, I know this is DVD and not Blu-ray but these subtitles were Windows Movie Maker quality, completely unacceptable for a 2015 release, DVD or not. Don't even get me started on how incredibly lazy the menu design is. This is like the type of menu you would see in a DVD release for some obscure cartoon from the 90's that got released because a niche group of fans demanded it, not for one of the most popular manga series of all time. The menu consists of a still image of the two leads from Part 1 and 2 along with only two sub-menus for the episode list and the DVD settings. What makes it even more clear that Warner Bros. is oblivious to the anime community is that the option for the Japanese audio track is literally written in Japanese. So apparently, the idiots responsible for localizing this DVD assumed that the only people who would want to watch this series in Japanese is Japanese people, which is why they only included subtitles for the English track.

Honestly though, under normal circumstances none of these things would be an issue. You can get anime in a variety of places these days without having to pirate it, so normally these things would only be an issue for collectors. This is not the case here, however, as the broadcasted and streamed versions of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure have heavily censored scenes when something particularly gory or violent happens. The DVD and Blu-ray versions in Japan are the only versions of the show that are uncensored, and this DVD is similarly uncensored. So in other words, the only way to watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure uncensored in the United States legally is to buy this subpar DVD. Honestly, this DVD makes a pretty good case for western fans to illegally download the uncensored subtitled version of the series.

I can only hope that, like with Ghost in the Shell, Viz Media will step in and give this series a proper release, because this is just a huge slap in the face.",1466121600,6,3817,4.626843657817109

My poor score is with the way it is packaged. I pull off the plastic wrapping, slide the case out of the cover, open the case about 100 degrees and the plastic pivoting center of the case that holds the first two DVDs snaps at the top and falls onto the floor. That was the first time I opened the case. I didn't hyperextend it in anyway. It was almost comical, if only Dio shouted ""Goodbye, JoJo!"" as the broken piece of the case plummeted to the ground.",1463097600,3,620,4.262711864406779
7203759,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"I love anime with pantomime and Onomatopoeia sound effects and this has a ton of both. The Naruto like chanting after Von Stroheim was reintroduced was the greatest. I have to wonder if Warner Brothers worked some on the soundtrack because there was some music choices that I would not expect in anime (the orchestra type music when JoJo and the Baron used the leaves to escape is the most notable example of this).
I also love anime where there is some science behind the fantastic feats the characters accomplish and this delivers there as well.",1461110400,,547,4.708333333333333

7203762,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"To start off I know a lot of plp don't like this release due to the lack of effort that WB put into it. That is true the menus of the DVDs could be better, but to be honest with the content I got I don't care if they didn't have a menu at all. BUT seriously hear me out, this is one of the best amine I've seen in awhile and I don't say that lightly. Yes, the menus are s***, but that doesn't take away from the actual content that you get. The stories that unfold in these to arcs are wonderfully told and the stories progress is such a unique way. After episode one I was hooked. I don't normally write reviews for anything but, for this series I was compelled to write one to encourage people to pick this up so we can continue to have JOJO released in North America dubbed. I know some plp dislike the dub as well, but I think it may be one of the best dubs I've heard in awhile, possibly ever. If your thinking of picking this up or even considering a blind buy of this first season, do it. This contains the first two story arcs Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, 26 episodes in all I believe. I blind bought this at a store in my area and I am very pleasantly surprised.

7203767,4,B00XYHOIIQ,"Let me start this off by saying, I adore the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure series. While as if yet I am only an anime-watcher, I have watched the series multiple times, and consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about the show. Before I get to the details of the DvD release, I will quickly speak about the show. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a multi-generational tale, as each part follows a different protagonist of the same familial line. Part 1 taking place from episode 1-9, and Part 2 taking the remainder of episodes of this season. The manga of Jojo's is incredibly popular in Japan, and is well-known for it's flamboyant nature and great action. The story is equal parts ridiculous and enthralling, with great comedy and suspense, often occurring simultaneously. The show is not meant to be taken too seriously, which can turn off some, but it still has legitimately touching moments and awesome scenes. For the sake of spoilers, I will not be talking about specifics, I will simply urge those interested to at least give it a try.

Now, on to the DvD itself. On a basic level, it does it's job. The video quality leaves little to complain about from me for a DvD release, but the absence of a Blu-ray option is puzzling. I would have paid however much it would cost for Blu-rays, but there is none. The English dub is perfectly serviceable, without too many noticeable changes to the script, which is great, as the script didn't need much changing. The dub is good, the accents are a nice touch, but ultimately the performances of the Japanese cast beat it, as the over-the-top nature of the show doesn't translate too well to English. Still, if you are one who only watches dubs, this one has no major problems. However, the features of this DvD are laughable. The only subtitle option for English is Closed Captioning for the English dub. Meaning, if you watch it in Japanese, the subs are not 100% accurate to what the characters are saying. Luckily, the script here follows very faithfully to the original, but there is weirdness in how the subs get timed to the speech at points, and having sounds being subbed at all times can be annoying. Having only 3 DvDs means that the video quality takes a hit accommodating for how many episodes are crammed onto a disk. Not immense, but you can tell from watching it in 1080p on Crunchyroll that it's different, having a stream site with better visual fidelity is frankly, bad. Also due to the disk space, there is no special features. No commentaries, no interviews, no nothing. This pales in comparison to even mediocre FUNimation releases, and is incredibly disappointing. Minor point, but why is Scooby-Doo being advertised here? Why is that a trailer on every disk? The audiences for these two shows are very different, it feels like you're being talked down to, like the people putting this out think it's a kids show, which is very much not the case. You can skip it, and you should.

Despite all of this, it's still a great show and the quality shines through. If you care about the series, I urge you to buy it, but let the licencors know what needs to improve. Jojo is finally getting a push in the West, and the fans should respond with support.",1452556800,5,3206,4.662544169611308

7203773,3,B00XYHOIIQ,"Was gonna order it off amazon but I found it at Best Buy similar to the price it was at the time so I went for it. Starting off with the quality of the dub, for the most part it's honestly pretty good. The only voice to truly bother me is Jonathans actor, though it grew on me over time. These are the uncensored episodes as well, so while I may still prefer the show subbed it has that over watching it on crunchyroll or paying tons of money to import the blurays (Warner Bro.s please release future seasons in bluray if you do). Now to go into the quality of the DVD's, it's eh. The subtitles for the DVD are meant for the english dub, so you COULD use them while watching it in Japanese but not everyone may like that. Otherwise, that's all to really say. The DVD set just includes all of season 1 uncensored. The quality of the menu's does look like it came out of a bootleg, but Warner Bros. seems to be doing that with all their smaller animated release. The menu's were the exact same for the DVD of Animaniacs Wakko's Wish on DVD a year ago. Honestly, if you watch the dub clips online and like them and want to support Jojo in the west, go for it if you can find it for $30 or less. The manga have been of much better quality but I think as support for Jojo in the west grows Warner Brothers will start to treat the release with better quality.",1450051200,3,1353,4.109433962264151

7203778,2,B00XYHOIIQ,"First of all, if you don't care about dubs at all, don't even bother with Amazon. The entire first season is available on Crunchyroll, and you can watch anime in HD quality for just $6.95 per month. Yes, the DVD has subs, but they're just closed captions of the dub script  it's one level removed from a direct translation.

If you do want to hear the dub, then just order the instant video from Amazon. You can get the entire series in HD (or in SD if you want, I guess) and aren't missing anything from the DVD - because the DVD doesn't have anything! Even the menus look like they come from some terrible bootleg (which I've discovered is common practice on DVDs and BDs released by Warner Brothers). Moreover there's no Blu-Ray, so you're STUCK watching it in standard definition.

Personally, I quite like the dub and I think it was done by talented people. It's very cheesy, but that's exactly what you want out of JoJo. I don't regret my Amazon Video purchase at all. But I also don't regret not buying the DVD. After all, there's literally no reason to. I'm pretty sure you can even hook up Amazon Video to an HD television screen if that's what you want.",1447200000,6,1163,4.425233644859813

7203783,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"Jojo's bizzare adventure is one of my favorite series, and this anime is a wonderful adaptation of the manga.

With that out of the way, this DVD set is pretty poor quality.
1. The DVDs would not play on my computer or any of my consoles. I had to borrow a DVD player from a friend. For a show as new as Jojo is (pretty sure it came out in 2012) it seems odd that it can't be played any other way.
2. The subtitles are terrible. They're just downright bad. There are inconsistencies in character names, and they tried to put the speaking character's names into the subtitles, and often times, they don't have the right character. They also added in sound effects to the subtitles, which I suppose is nice for the hearing impaired, but for me it takes away from the experience.
3. The DVD defaults to the english dubbed version. This may not bother everyone, but it really irked me. I have never watched the show in English, so I can't comment on that, but the original Japanese is stellar.
4. The menus are pretty mediocre. It's pretty obvious that minimal time and effort went into making this DVD set. The menus look bad, are very unresponsive, and have weird music in them that is totally unrelated to the show. It would have been very easy to simply put one of the intro songs or Roundabout (the ending credits song by Yes) into the menus.

Finally, if you like or are interested in Jojo, find some other way to view it. These DVds do not deserve your money.",1446076800,10,1462,4.3713235294117645
7203784,5,B00XYHOIIQ,"Excellent release, don't listen to the other reviewer bashing this product because they didn't get a bluray release, how is that a fair review of this product? The dvd's are of excellent quality, couldn't be happier, who care's if they're not bluray, I wouldn't notice the difference. There's an English and Japanese audio, those complaining otherwise are too stupid to use a remote, the dub is superbly done better than most dub I've heard from other anime, they go as far use proper accents for their era and whereabouts, which is more than I can say for the Japanese audio, who ever heard Brits speak fluent Japanese anyway? I want to thank Warner for going through the effort of dubbing this masterpiece, and hope they release Stardust Crusaders in the same fashion.",1445990400,2,770,4.840909090909091
7203785,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"This is a really difficult review to write. I love Jojo's, and want it to continue to come out over here.

However, this is probably the poorest actual release I've ever seen.

Literally the cheapest DVD box I've ever seen, and the menus are actually sub-bootleg quality. This isn't hyperbole, almost every fansub or Chinese bootleg I've ever purchased has better menu quality.

I could deal with all that, and this would probably still be a 3-star review. HOWEVER:

The sub is atrocious. Just the worst. It's a word-for-word copy of the dub. First of all, the dub is very, very loose. It changes some of the scenes, and slightly alters characters. If someone merely says ""Jojo-sama"" and the subtitles say ""Oh no, look out for this attack!"" it's actually really jarring. The characters are less stoic, and the comic timing distorted and less clever. In an ironic twist, whenever a character exclaims in English, the subtitles will read <speaking in foreign language>.

You're *actually* better off watching bootleg translations. For shame. I honestly don't know if I'll buy Stardust Crusaders unless the quality is improved.

Lastly, Araki produces some of the most amazing artwork, why use the most generic of shots for the cover?",1445904000,8,1231,4.980487804878049

7203787,2,B00XYHOIIQ,"I will start by saying I love the series.  It's goofy, unique, and all around awesome.  However, this DVD set is subpar at best.

DO NOT BUY this, instead go buy the Viz Media release of the manga. Warner Bros need to be taught that a release like this is not acceptable in 2015.",1445126400,3,282,4.2407407407407405
7203789,4,B00XYHOIIQ,"This is a fantastic anime series. It is indeed very bizarre, and has quite a unique feel to it. The over-the-top, exaggerated fight scenes and the serious story balance each other out nicely to prevent the series from being either too dark or too ridiculous. This first season is very well paced, and there are no filler episodes. At 26 episodes, watching it doesn't take up an excessive amount of time; although there are more seasons of the anime, since the series is broken up into distinct story arcs that take place years apart from each other and focus on different characters, the first season tells a complete story on its own.

While the series itself is wonderful, this DVD release is disappointing. It is clear that very little time or effort was put into the creation of the menus, which look quite shoddy. The fact that it includes an English dub shows that some attention was given to this release, but while I am willing to give most dubs a chance, this one is, quite frankly, awful. Although the original Japanese audio is also available with English subtitles, these subtitles are taken from the poorly-written dub script. I enjoyed the series enough not to regret supporting its Western release and I am glad that I am able to own it on DVD, but I really wish it had gotten better treatment. I can only hope that any future releases for this series will have more care put into them.",1444348800,9,1401,4.604
7203790,1,B00XYHOIIQ,"If you are like me, and am a big fan of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, then DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS!!
I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY IT

It arrived his morning, and looked to be the real deal. So we looked on the back, and saw no mention of the Japanese audio track. We were ready to return it on the spot, as the JJBA dub makes a complete mockery of the series. However, we were ever hopeful that maybe the series had the original audio track, and just didn't state it on the back. So we decided to have a look.

Oh dear lord. The menu screen looks like it was done on Microsoft PowerPoint, with cheesy, completely unrelated music playing in the background. So we checked the language options. The two they give you, is English, and Japanese, HOWEVER, the only subtitle option is English Hard of Hearing - meaning that this is the subtitle option for the English dub, NOT the Japanese. So in short, there is no official subtitle option for the Japanese track. It does come with Italian and French subtitles also.

We went through a couple of episodes to see what the subtitles were like, and to be honest, they were just as bad. Having watched the Crunchyroll streams or both Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency a few times, I can tell you now, they are far superior.
The subtitles have been taken from the dubbed script, therefore are not the official subtitles, and as I have said, if you are like me, and watched the series elsewhere, you will notice BIG changes.

The soundtrack for the series has been raised a pitch, so all the background music sounds off, and to be quite frank, odd!! Hearing the openings at a higher pitch is not right. Why must they do this?

So in short, I am pretty pissed off right now. I was hoping that with an official DVD release, that Jojo's would become more popular over in the west, and eventually pave the way for more merchandise. But boy, was I wrong! This is a prime example of getting quick money on the cheap, by putting no effort into a release. WB obviously couldn't be bothered to put official subtitles down, and instead, are promoting the dub - which turns the series into a complete joke, and takes away from the series is really supposed to be about.

As other reviewers have stated, if you want to support Jojo's in the West, buy the manga instead.

7203792,3,B00XYHOIIQ,"Okay after watching the show and seeing all the others reviews for this, I've decided to put in my 2 cents. First of all, the show itself, incredible and I feel so happy to finally own it on DVD. Now for my gripes, the menus are incredibly bland and I find it really cheap that they didn't bother to subtitle the openings (the ending is forgivable since the song is in English) or translate any of the credits, instead they shove them into the end of each disc and you can't pause them. And also, while I mostly watch the dub, I sympathize with sub watchers because the subs are all closed captions from the dub.
 That being said, I don't think it's THAT bad of a release. For one, they actually included a top notch English dub, one of the best I've heard in years. Also they clearly used the Japanese dvd version, because I saw a few scenes I didn't remember seeing on Crunchyroll. If they had really gone for the cheap, they would have gone with just the subtitled TV version. Also, people keep calling the picture quality crap. I'll admit it could be better (they really shouldn't have condensed the show into just 3 discs), but again; better then when I watched it on the internet.
Ultimately I'd say the main problem comes from the fact that Warner Brothers isn't exactly an anime company and the lack experience with it shows on this release. I'll admit they should have done better for this, but I don't think this release is the god-awful piece of crap people keep saying it is. Hopefully, they'll release the second series and do better with it.",1443657600,24,1555,4.456140350877193
