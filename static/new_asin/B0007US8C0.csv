2244857,5,B0007US8C0,I love A Touch of Frost.  I love Frost himself.  His cases are interesting and I enjoy following his progress.  I wish BBC America and PBS would show more of Frost.,1123632000,5,164,4.225806451612903
2244858,5,B0007US8C0,"Frost is an English policeman in a mid sized English city (Denton) who is an unpolished (Inspector) Morse.

He is not neat,dislikes authority (comic elements in both),but is clever,brave,lucky and empthetic with

victims. He is given a new partner in each episode. The acting,photography,music and character

development are excellent. In series 6,his house has been rebuilt

(after the fire) and he takes in a lodger

to help pay his bills (includes a loveable dog).In the first case,

he solves an old case (Appendix Man) after

being convinced to withdraw his resignation. In the second he solves a case with a dead teenaged runaway and meat processors

who are involved in smuggling and ultimately

murder. The most attractive feature of this set is the price

reduction which brings it in line with similar

DVD sets. One does have to get used to the English

use of episode titles which are not very revealing or

informative to US viewers. An excellent series.",1120780800,17,967,4.96875
2244869,5,B0007US8C0,"As usual, crimes to solve, issues in the precinct, and Jack deals with his life, his colleagues, and the challenges of solving crimes in his own Jack-like way.",1444262400,,159,4.714285714285714
2244870,5,B0007US8C0,"I enjoy all the BBC copper shows....Morse, Lewis, Midsommer Murders, Vera, Banks..this is amongst the best. Think Colombo. This guy is innocuously bright while seeming to be a hopeless mess.

Watch out if you start though....it's addicting.

Also beware, Amazon has labeled season 6 and 5 backwards, which is extraordinarily disappointing because the seasons do carry over, and events from one season preface the other. Check release dates before watching, don't use season numbers",1438646400,,481,5.486486486486487

2244872,5,B0007US8C0,"Frost Mysteries are alway absorbing and intricate. Frost is the antithesis of a hero. Kind of mundane, a little amusing and witty--but not your hero type. Why he plunges into dangerous situation with his small frame and no gun is beyond me--but the combination works!",1432944000,,267,4.955555555555556
2244873,5,B0007US8C0,David Jason as Frost is unforgettable.  I have watched every episode at least 3 times.,1432252800,,86,4.733333333333333

2244876,5,B0007US8C0,"This is one of the very best series I have ever enjoyed.  David Jason is impeccable as Jack Frost, a seasoned detective.  The amazing part of the film is the tremendous depth of character displayed by Jack Frost.  Frost deals in the very real world of ignorance, greed, and political power mongering with a depth of wisdom which is seldom shown in TV or Movie drama.  If you are tired of the shallow and stupid characters often displayed in the entertainment industry this is a refreshing change.",1416355200,,496,4.666666666666667

2244891,5,B0007US8C0,"My wife and I have become addicted to the Frost series. In season 6 he is a little less disheveled, but still very human, with the possible exception of his obsession with catching the criminal. It is especially touching to see his ability to empathized with the victims and their relatives. Not portrayed very well in most American detective series.",1405209600,,350,4.85
2244892,5,B0007US8C0,"Writing and acting are terrific! It actually took me a while to get into Frost coming from Morse and Lewis and even Lynley, but Frost is even more nuanced and has terrific stories. All these series are gems of different colors. A great character study and sometimes very very funny.",1404432000,,282,4.66
2244893,5,B0007US8C0,Great writing and great characters. Must see TV. Jack Frost is a quirky DCI always at odds with his demanding boss but with a knack of shrewdly interrogating people to obtain the information needed to solve the case.,1402012800,,216,4.7105263157894735
2244894,5,B0007US8C0,Collected the whole show; all seasons.  One of the best detective shows I've ever seen.  Learned quite a bit of British culture!,1401148800,,128,4.7727272727272725
2244895,5,B0007US8C0,"This is our second go around with the Frost series. A little bit of everything and of course, David Jason just makes the show.",1390348800,,126,4.291666666666667

2244912,1,B0007US8C0,"Another of those Brit dramas featuring a curmudgeonly detective. Boring and predictable .I prefer the dishier detectives: Laurence Fox, Nathaniel Parker and Michael Kitchen.",1367452800,,173,6.25

2244914,5,B0007US8C0,I love all the Frost series - the stories are all unique and interesting.  The subtitles are a great help because the English words and accent are hard to understand.,1363737600,,166,4.533333333333333
2244915,5,B0007US8C0,I like David Jason from other TV shows and I like this kind of DVD. A lovable detective who does NOT play by the book.,1360454400,,118,3.76

2244918,5,B0007US8C0,"As a huge fan of British shows, especially the detective/mystery series, I simply love Frost. He is brilliant and funny with his bad mood and lack of organization, and I hope that one day I have the whole collection.",1354838400,,216,4.564102564102564

2244935,5,B0007US8C0,"I discovered Frost a few years ago on A&E and enjoyed the series a lot.  I bought the  VHS tapes that were available at that time.  I now have a DVD player and was happy to be able to buy the rest of the series.  I love his combination of toughness when dealing with a criminal and his compassion when dealing with the victims.  I'm curious to know if the series is still on the air in England - if so, I'm looking forward to buying the dvd's when they come out.  I even enjoy the characters so much that I have bought some of the Frost books.  In other words, I'm a real fan.",1261526400,,576,3.9565217391304346
2244936,5,B0007US8C0,"We have watched all the British Mystery series; Morse, Lewis, Rebus, Gently, etc  and Frost is by far the best. The mix of muystery, humor and superior characters makes for a masterpiece. Wish there were many more!

2244937,5,B0007US8C0,"I thoroughly enjoyed all the Frost DVD's. Episodes are all well written and there is a nice balance of wit and humour in each episode. Thankfully there is not alot of CSI type mumbo jumbo and the villian is usually a nice little surprise. My only quibble is that it is not clear that each investigation is a team exercise so at times Frosts faithful sgt suddenly announces a leap forward in the plot because of some other officers queries. As I say a minor quibble, there is after all only so much time in an episode. Highly recommended.",1252800000,,537,4.434343434343434
2244938,5,B0007US8C0,"In the continued series of Jack Frost, these 4 episodes will leave the Frost fan very satisfied.",1126569600,3,96,4.705882352941177
8051951,5,B0007US8C0,"We recently got a subscription to Brit Box and I wasn't sure what to watch other than the shows I already knew. Because there are so many detective shows to choose from, it was difficult to make up my mind which ones to try. ""A Touch of Frost"" must be at least 20 years old, but it's excellent--among the best of the genre that I've seen. What we love are the quirky supporting characters, the lead character who doesn't take himself too seriously, and the excellent storylines. I definitely feel as if I have stumbled across a real gem!",1523232000,,537,4.434343434343434
