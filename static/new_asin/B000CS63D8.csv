2472346,1,B000CS63D8,I agree don't buy this until Marvel learns not to piece meal an entire series.,1243728000,7,78,4.266666666666667
2472347,5,B000CS63D8,"This show is a five star hands down, but the releases are poor and not worth your buck. In this purchase, there's only five episodes and commentary. Just wait for the whole season, maybe they'll get the message by not buying this.",1243468800,16,230,4.5
2472348,1,B000CS63D8,"Did you know there are 24 episodes in this season? That means I am missing 19(30min)shows. I did not get what I paid for therefore I have lost my ""Fate in the Future"" of contining to by these series.",1265587200,,199,4.128205128205129
2472349,5,B000CS63D8,This voulume in paticular has my favorite nemesis.  The Sentinels! This one is worth getting to see the X-Men battle them to the finish.  I was really impressed with the action sequences in this entry.  This paticular one gives you five episodes instead of the usual four or three.  I do like watching Wolvie being the leader is this story.  Scott Summers (Cyclops) turns out to be the brooding outcast in this one.  Wolverine and Cyclops switch roles in this universe.  The writing was better than the previous voulumes and the interactions between the characters are much better in this set of episodes.,1265414400,2,605,4.815533980582524
2472350,5,B000CS63D8,I want to say something here do not buy the volumes if anybody know this or not you can go to amazon.ca and buy the whole season for $39.99 Canadian which is a little over $40. It is worth it trust me I bought it when it came out and I absolutely love it and I advise everyone to do the same instead of buying these seperate volumes everyone is saying to wait for season 1 to come out but amazon.ca already has it.,1263945600,,414,3.9404761904761907
2472351,5,B000CS63D8,"I've seen many reviews on these DVD's, claiming they are ""Rip-Off's"" and ""Wait for the box-set"". Now, I do not have satellite, or even cable for that matter. I can't watch this great show on TV.

So (Unlike alot of people, it would seem) I'm willing to push out the 10 bucks every 4 or so months, (I will NOT however, pay the 20 they wanted for the first volume) so I can get five more episodes of this show that I have grown fond of. Besides, I believe the audio commentaries alone are worth the money.

I'll buy this when it comes out. And I'll probably love it like I have the others.",1261180800,11,587,4.140350877192983
2472352,3,B000CS63D8,"I agree that this is a pretty good show, but with only a couple of episodes on each release, the full season is much more cost effective.",1256256000,,137,4.111111111111111
2472353,5,B000CS63D8,Amazon.ca (Canada) currently as the entire Season One for about US $50 (US$40 plus $10 next day shipping via DHL.  These are region 1 DVDs. The set comes in an Limited Edition Steelbook Case.,1254700800,2,191,4.617647058823529
2472354,2,B000CS63D8,"This version of the X-Men is far from perfect. However the storylines have been adapted pretty much the way they were from the comics.  I do have to question the motivations of the packagers of this show.  I was fortunate to purchase this at Wal-Mart for $9.99.  Other retailers are charging more.

The animation reminds me style of Batman: The Animated Series. Unlike the 90's version, the figures are all streamlined and devoid of details.  I suppose it's more affordable to get them on the air. If I were producing this show I'd make an attempt to use CGI for the figures.  I can't help but think that someone along the line said how the show has to be produced economically. It's only that the CGI shows get the ratings.  It's too bad some executive at Marvel doesn't say if we want to stay on the air and sell DVD's CGI will keep the fans coming back.

On the stories, I am glad it isn't just one of those kid versions of the characters.  The new Spectacular Spiderman seems be interested in just the pre teen fans.  The best aspect of some the latest Marvel's are the fact that they try to attract the adult fans. These aren't strictly Saturday Morning type toons.",1249603200,3,1170,4.450704225352113
2472355,1,B000CS63D8,"No matter how good the movie, people can see that the almighty dollar not the consumer drives the marketing of Marvel items.  Being frugal will teach Marvel a lesson.",1247270400,4,166,4.724137931034483
2472356,1,B000CS63D8,"I agree with the comments on NOT BUYING THIS DVD. It's a great series, but releasing only 4 episodes at a time is just corp. America taking us for a ride. When you can get complete seasons of great animated series (like Justice League Unlimited) for under $24, you gotta think... ""only 4 episodes, WTF???""

Don't get caught up in this marketing hype, wait until they get it right and release the season set.",1245801600,15,407,4.5
2472357,5,B000CS63D8,"This is a great show that really shows a new direction in animation for X-Men and Steven Blum as Wolverine is Wolverine
Now I noticed a lotta people are gettin upset and down right immature
about the fact that for $10 we've been gettin 3 eps(1st volume)and
now 5 eps with this one
This is a great deal and if you people wanna complain about full season boxsets then go watch some anime then see that single volumes (like these)
sell for $20-$30 for just 3 eps
So you guys have nothin to complain about for $10 this is a steal",1245542400,4,525,4.207920792079208

8101503,5,B000CS63D8,This will be the same review for all of the Wolverine and the Xmen series.  Even though it seems that every evolution of these stories  changes the mythos I am still interested because of good writing and good animation.,1382659200,,220,4.615384615384615
8101504,5,B000CS63D8,"This video was well done for an animated video. The art work and animation was well done. These guys and gals who are the artists, are very skillful in their chosen profession.

8101508,5,B000CS63D8,i paid 25 for all volume 1-6 and it was worth it. It was about alittle more then $4 for each volume but im glad i did.. besides my kids love it as well. even my 5year old daughter loves it... so don't wait anymore just buy now..,1307577600,,228,3.7708333333333335

8101510,5,B000CS63D8,"I'm practicing the very difficult art of ""patience"" and am awaiting the eventual box set release of Season 1 with all 26 episodes together.

But....if you do decide to go the more expensive route of purchasing the 6 volumes seperatey, take comfort in knowing that the approximate $60.00 it will cost you to purchase them seperately bought you 9 hours and 53 minutes worth of animated X-Men goodness (although volume 6 hasn't been announced yet but when it does it should have the last 3 episodes)!

If that's worth it for you then more power to you, enjoy your purchase because waiting for the complete box set of Season 1 is just as difficult a decision to make as it is to drop that $60.00.

Now, who wants to guess how much the Season 1 complete box set will go for here on Amazon?

I say definately below $60.00!

Know what's funny, regardless that it's animation, I would rather have over 9 hours of this show than 2 hours of that silly Wolverine movie even if I do end up dropping that $60 (fingers crossed I can resist)!

Fox movies could learn a thing or two from this animated series on how to properly handle their Marvel license and not just with the X-Men!

Thanks for reading, hope this helps you make your decision.

Now c'mon Lionsgate, i'm not getting any younger.....please hurry with the Season 1 Box Set!

Oh, and did I mention that a Cap, Thor and Avengers movie are being made, i've died and went to heaven.

Edit: Screw this, i'm also going the Amazon Canadian route, I don't need no stinking commentaries....thanks for the heads up everyone.

8101511,5,B000CS63D8,"There are several reviews for this DVD series stating things like ""Don't buy these, wait for the box set."" But that's ridiculous logic. Think about it - why do companies release DVDs with only a few episodes on them? TO TEST THE MARKET. If the numbers come in low for the tester sets, then they quit releasing the series.

Granted, some companies release things this way for the money, but I really think LionsGate was testing the water and now that they are seeing steady sales of the Wolverine & the X-Men DVDs, they are continuing to release the series. After they release the entire series by volume, sure, they may go back and release it by box set, but if their initial sales had been bad, they would never release all the episodes. And I believe the evidence lies in the number of episodes that are included on each volume - the 1st volume only had 3 episodes, but each volume after has had 4-5 episodes - hence the tester DVDs have had good sales, and now they want to release the entire series for the fans.

I encourage people to check out this series. I am a huge fan of the 90's X-Men series, and this series comes much closer to that than the Evolution series did. Each episode stands alone, but it also has a great arching storyline which keeps the series moving forward. 5 Stars.",1265760000,,1294,4.410041841004184
