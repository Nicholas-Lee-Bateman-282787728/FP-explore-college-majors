5408880,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"All 3 disks come in a slim DVD case, not much else to say except you know Daniel Craig is the BEST James Bond EVER!!!!  Don't let your wife tell you the Bourne series is better.  Poppy-cock.  BOND!!!!",1372636800,,200,4.2105263157894735
5408881,5,B00ABHRMQ2,The three movies are what bond needed to compete with Bourne.  The three movies were brilliantly written with the support of great acting.  Daniel Craig as Bond was the best thing this franchise could've done.  This set of all three movies is a must for any movie watcher.,1372291200,2,272,4.625
5408882,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"Casino Royale was finally filmed and acted out the way it should have been.  It was exciting, well written and plotted and acted gorgeously.  Eva Green was wonderful and beautiful as the doomed love of Bond's life and you could feel Craig's sorrow and hurt when he realizes that he had been betrayed.  Of course Judi Dench was marvelous as usual.  Mads Mikelsohn was a marvel as the villain and he played it with a slick, sick verve.  Loved this film.

Quantum of Solace is not everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed it far more than the longer films.  Quantum was gritty, dirty and down right real leaving out all of the gadgetry and eye candy with the exception of the all too real Olga Kurylenko, the only Bond heroine who was on equal footing with Bond and didn't sleep with him.  Her character had an agenda, just as  Bond had an agenda and together they formed an alliance that turned out to be unbeatable.  The film was only something like 1 hour and 45 minutes long, but it was never dull, boring, or stupid and hit all of its marks.

Skyfall - this is a tough one.  I hated it on the first viewing because this one required you to be on your toes and to pay attention and think.  Also, I was very tired that day and, although I was excited to get to see it on it's first showing, I fell asleep for a good 45 minutes to an hour so I woke not knowing what had gone after it started and I fell asleep and woke again to find that Bond and M are on the run.  I finally streamed it on Vudu and, boy was I surprised at what a great film this was.  I have watched it several times and have great respect for the making of this installment.  My one big complaint was Berenice (whatever her last name) is being in the film so damned briefly.  She was so damned beautiful and exotic.  No Bond beauty has ever been this gorgeous and she was in and out of the film in a minute and I didn't know why or what she had done that angered the villain.  Of course Javier Bardem was wonderful as usual.  Also, when they tie all the characters into their Ian Fleming created character slots at the end that was brilliant.

This is a very good collection for the money, however, Quantum of Solace is still my favorite or the three.  I love good film noir and this fit the bill.  The other two I will say are brilliant companions but without the story in Quantum of Solace, you couldn't tie the other two together.  If any 3 Bond films would form at trilogy, it is these.",1369440000,2,2461,4.187234042553191
5408883,4,B00ABHRMQ2,"My thoughts on the films...

CASINO ROYALE: A
I really love this movie.  As a fan of 007 and a proud owner of the Bond 50 box set, I recently saw all the Bond movies (some again, others for the first time).  ""Casino Royale"" is my favorite Bond film of them all.  I think this film does everything right and finds the correct tone for what a Bond movie should be.  The action sequences are very intense - the stunts in the opening chase are still impressive after dozens of viewings.  I believe Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond, and this was a great way to introduce him into the franchise.  I also liked Eva Green, who makes an excellent Bond girl (and one that Bond truly cares for); as well as Mads Mikkelsen, who plays the villain Le Chiffre.  It's an added bonus that the film is set around a game of poker, a game that I personally love and appreciate.

QUANTUM OF SOLACE: B
""Quantum of Solace"" deals with the aftermath of the events in ""Casino Royale"" and picks up right where that film left off.  This movie has some good performances and remarkable stunts.  I enjoy it, although I do think it is the weakest of the three films in this collection.  One thing I do not like is that the action scenes are cut in a very frantic manner - the editing is choppy and relies too often on close-ups; it is often difficult to tell what is going on and where characters are in relation to one another.

SKYFALL: A-
""Skyfall"" opens with the apparent ""death"" of Bond, and his return to MI6 and the modern world gives him the perfect opportunity to reinvent himself.  While the film keeps the same grounded and realistic approach as ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum"", it does pay homage to the classic Bond films and has more of a playful tone - something that fans of the early movies will appreciate.  Sam Mendes is a great director, and I was so happy that he was chosen to work on this series.  He successfully plots ideas about today's technologically advanced cyber terrorism, and contrasts that with an aging Bond who likes to do things the old-fashioned way.  Javier Bardem as Silva is one of the best villains the franchise has ever seen.  The end of the movie completes this trilogy of films in a nice (although somber) way, while at the same time presenting a possible direction for future films.

ABOUT THIS PRODUCT:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Craig-007-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00BPMGFLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Craig 007 Collection [Blu-ray</a>]

This set is simply a repackaging of the individual films.  If you already own the movies, there's no reason to consider this purchase.  But if you do not yet own these films, then this product is highly recommended - it's 3 Bond films in one package at an affordable price.

There is one small flaw in this product: Casino Royale previously had a two-disc collectors edition - Disc 1 had the movie and Disc 2 had special features.  Unfortunately, Disc 2 from that set is not included in this collection, so you will be missing out on the bonus material that was on that disc.  I know this won't matter to everyone, but it will clearly be a factor for completists as well as people who like to watch the bonus features on the making of the movies.

5408909,5,B00ABHRMQ2,Casino Royal is my favorite Bond film and Skyfall was an amazing movie showing the complex relationship between Bond and M. Quantum of Solace is the weakest film but still more entertaining that some of Bond's cheesier 70s and 80s movies.

An older Bond working for a senior-citizen woman boss ""aided"" by an agent who is a black woman, with a psychologically disturbed rogue agent as enemy, and lots of deep psychology. I personally prefer straight unpretentious adventures.

There are quite a few exciting sequences but a fair number of the scenes are filmed in semi-darkness (for no particular reason other than to be clever), and so the end result is a bit disappointing.",1411257600,,471,4.85

5408939,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"I really love Daniel Craig as James Bond because he doesn't try to ""Copy"" all of the older James Bond actors. In my opinion, there was Sean Connery, who is or was, the best James Bond ever. The definitive James Bond. No ne comes close to him. Not in his incredible wonderful style and fashion. The next few James Bonds tried... To imitate the Sean Connery style and in my opinion they all fall flat.

With Daniel Craig, James Bond is Re-Invented. He is ""modernized"" in the sense that James Bond becomes more believable, a ""grittier"" character, a much more ""realistic"" version of what a ""Double O"" agent actually may be. There is much less ""flash,"" and the ""unbelievable cars and exploding gadgets"" are completely toned down in these movies.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the villains, who are about as unrealistic as ever. Perhaps this series biggest weakness. or are they deliberately flamboyant? In order to contrast more with this new school of James Bond?
I don't know...  You will have to watch them to decide for yourself.

James Bond is still stylish, still the super 007, somehow more real, more human, and more deadly then ever. Low keyed and always cool. Daniel Craig's acting makes this possible. He finally breaks out from the ""Sean Connery"" school and creates as I said above, a wonderful performance of a James Bond that is fresh, that is closer to ""real Life,"" that is closer to us..Daniel Craig portrays Bond in a much more ""toned down"" fashion, a much more realistic portrayal of a typical agent. one who does NOT want to draw too much attention to himself, does not want to stand out of the crowd and be noticed, or perhaps worse, rememberable.
This may be perhaps the first and most important development in the whole James Bond franchise; Since Sean Connery.

I really enjoyed this. Each movie was excellent. I loved them. I wish they would continue on, with Daniel Craig, and make a few more movies. Before Craig, for me, there was only Sean Connery,  as I grew up watching him playing James Bond. What a ""Magnetic and Charismatic"" personality! ( Yet the fact remains that an agent acting as such, in the field, wouldn't survive or stay alive, for very long )

 Now I see Daniel Craig and I can enjoy his interpretation as much, as he brings us a great performance, with a charismatic, deadly, performance that also includes a ""new"" side of 007 that I always kinda knew should be there. An often grim determination to ""just get the job done"" a side of him that surfaces often, as well as the side of him that shows his intelligence and ruthless cunning. He is a complicated person, a much more multi-faceted portrayal of Bond.  He lays his life on the line, time and time again, yet his loyalties are questioned over and over... This bothers him, yet he never lets it show. Once again, Daniel Craig makes Bond all his own, successfully redefining Bond as no other actor has, since Connery.",1406937600,2,2926,4.644100580270793

5408948,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"I have waited my whole adult life for the ""real"" James Bond to show up. When I was 15 yrs. old my Dad got me a subscription to both Road & Track & Playboy. Playboy had been around the house since the mid-fifties. They had started to serialize the Bond novels in the early sixties and yes, I read the articles & stories, as well as looked at the photos in the magazine. By the time I was 16 I had read most all of the series. I had a picture in my head of what he looked like, the kind of cars he drove ( a super-charged Bentley ) and the women that he loved. The first three films were not that picture. Don't get me wrong, Sean Connery and the DB-5 were great, but there was always a little too much ""tongue in cheek"" for my liking. My Dad was a ""Bird-Col."" in SAC and James Bond was a Commander in the Royal Navy. I knew what kind of ""man"" Bond was  ""James Bond"". Daniel Craig hits the ""Nail on the head"". Judi Dench as ""M"" is nothing less then Spectacular. And the cast of villains is golden. All three films dove-tail into each other, making for a mini-series on the level of ""Band of Brothers"" or ""The Pacific"". The reality of the chases, hand to hand combat and settings draws you in and never lets you go. These films are a ""10"" !",1396310400,,1237,4.028455284552845

5408975,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"There's not a lot to say, if you're reading this review, you've probably seen at least on of these movies before and are just debating on pulling the trigger on this collection. Simply put, for the price this is an absolute steel. Casino Royale and Skyfall were great movies, and Quantum of Solace was ok, and to grab all 3 for 20 bucks is a bargain.

On the off chance you haven't seen any of them, it's a great investment to add to your collection. If you like James Bond, or just action movies in general, than this is for you. It's not campy like the last couple Brosnan Bond films or Roger Moore's run as Bond. It delivers on being serious and a little dark in a way that Dalton's James Bond tried but failed at. It'll be interesting to see how Skyfall's follow up will be, that one stays gritty but sets up a lot of old school Bond flourishes like Q and Moneypenny.",1385683200,,871,4.246987951807229

5408979,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"The latest 007 films feature a gritty edge and a more (in my mind) realistic Bond.
Daniel Craig's character is more than bloodied by the end of each film and you really get the sense that he is an Agent giving his body, mind, and soul to complete the mission.
In no film is this more evident in the last film which is Skyfall.

I want to keep this short and to the point as to not contain any spoilers!

With that said --- for $20 you get three great espionage action movies.
Arguably my favorite films of the entire 007 Franchise.

Casino Royale - First and in my opinion features the best pacing of the three. I felt the movie focused more on mind-games between two incredibly dangerous and intelligent people which is a refreshing change of pace for the James Bond films.

Quantum of Solace - Great movie by itself but unfortunately falls short of the other two.

Skyfall - I believe is arguable the best and most critically-acclaimed which is GREAT NEWS because it's the last of the three.",1383436800,6,993,4.434065934065934

5408987,5,B00ABHRMQ2,"This is an outstanding set of Danile Craig's three outings as James Bond. CASINO ROYALE, QUANTUM OF SOLACE and SKYFALL are fantastic Bond films. Since QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a direct squeal to CASINO ROYAL this makes this set all the more advantageous and attractive. I gravitate towards CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. In both of these films I see a confident and self-reliant Bond. In SKYFALL it seems as though Bond had fallen from grace. It drops the continuity of Craig's first two Bond films. One thing that all these films have in common is the relationship of Judy Dench's M and her dedicated civil servant. It is an interesting relationship. That is one of the strengths or weaknesses, depending on your point of view, of SKYFALL. The transfers are quite good, especially QUANTUM OF SOLACE. The colors on QUANTUM OF SOLACE are just gorgeous and incredibly sharp and quite pristine.",1378771200,9,893,4.8431372549019605

He's not only good looking, but he's not a ""pretty boy"" like all the other Bonds tended to be so you can actually believe that he is as bad ass as the things he does. That being said, I love all of these movies, even though Quantum of Solace could have been better, and I also got my boyfriend really into them as well. So, when he casually mentioned one day that he would love all of the Daniel Craig Bond movies, I thought it would make a great gift for him. This set is perfect!
