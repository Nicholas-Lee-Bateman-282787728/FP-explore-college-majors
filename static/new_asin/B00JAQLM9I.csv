6351753,5,B00JAQLM9I,"Cuban fury is a predictable movie but an enjoyable one. The movie starts off with a boy who enjoys dancing, but gets ridiculed, harassed, and assaulted because of his passion of dance, he gave up his passion forever until he found something as an adult to inspire him to dance again.

Dancing again changed his life, it made him overcome his child hood fears of being subdued and subordinate which stunted him in his everyday life growing up. Overcoming these fears made him feel like a man, something he did not feel before, he regained his confidents and his true belief in himself.

I enjoyed this movie because of the dancing but also the values it illustrates: not to give up on ones self when things gets challenging, when your week in some areas in your life seek out help or instructions to improve ones self, respect self and others feelings when rediscovering confidents and pride again. I truly say I recommend this movie, great dancing and music, what else can you ask for?",1402963200,6,985,4.655172413793103
6351754,4,B00JAQLM9I,"As I chortled my way through an early screening of this enjoyably predictable, R-rated comedy (language and alcohol), my mind was awash with all my favorite old dance movies that had just received a cinematic tip of the hat: ""Footloose,"" ""Dirty Dancing,"" ""Dance With Me,"" ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Shall We Dance?"" ""The Full Monty,"" and ""Strictly Ballroom"" for starters. I""m sure you can add a few.

We follow a former teenage championship salsa dancer who had been waylaid by a gang of bullies on his way to the finals. He ended up burning his dance shoes and never looked back. Now, 22 years later, he's an adult who never seems to finish anything, but mentions maybe he might dance again. Our hero has a posse of friends who are understandably skeptical, after all, he has NEVER danced in the twenty years they have known him.

Let's look at the cast:
  * Nick Frost (""The World's End"") is our sadly out-of-shape hero. He still wants to dance, but has a new bully to make his life miserable.
  * Chris O'Dowd (""The Sapphires"") is that bully. I expected to like him but his disgusting mouth and vile pranks certainly changed my mind.
  * Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") is their new coworker. She IS an American and a bit awkward, but she does love to dance the Salsa!
  * Olivia Colman (""Hot Fuzz"") is the world's BEST sister!
  * Ian McShane (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") is the foul-mouthed dance instructor our hero let down when he was a no-show years ago.
  * Kayvan Novak (Lots of TV) is the hilarious classmate who takes our hero in hand, upgrades his wardrobe and makes him shave his chest.

I must commend Jonathan Amos with his tight and seamless editing. He convinced ME that Frost did all that dancing!

BTW, keep a sharp lookout in the parking garage for a don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-him cameo by Nick Frost's chum Simon Pegg! Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1396137600,5,1901,4.663663663663663

6351775,4,B00JAQLM9I,I have been a fan of Nick Frost since the BBC Show SPACED.  Was looking to see what he did recently and ran across the trailer for Cuban Fury.  Bought the film and was not let down.  Its nice to see Nick Frost take a lead role and dance with it.  The story is simple and enjoyable.  I love British comedies.  Nick Frost pulls off what must have been a lot of Salsa training and it shows.  Ian McShane did a great job as the Salsa mentor to Nick Frosts character Bruce.  I loved all of Bejan's (Kayvan Novak) 80's references and comments.  If you enjoy a good light hearted comedy then you will enjoy Cuban Fury.  Simon Pegg also makes a quick (so quick you can miss it) cameo.,1439164800,,676,4.130769230769231
6351776,5,B00JAQLM9I,"You won't regret watching this film, it's an absolute riot.  Wonderful mix of talented acting and brilliant comedy but most appealing is the heart and earnestness of the hero character.

6351778,4,B00JAQLM9I,"As they say: Sometimes it isn't the destination but the trip itself that is important. It's the trip that makes this cookie cutter outing worth while.

Here's the scoop. Bruce (Nick Frost) fell in love with Salsa dancing at an early age. It was his life and he was great at it until some bullies beat him up and called him a pansy. He gave it all up. Now, as an adult, overweight engineer, he finds out his new, fetching, female boss is a Salsa dancer and he thinks he might want to reconsider his love of the dance.

I only know Nick Frost as Simon Pegg's hapless sidekick in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" But it seems he's breaking out as a writer and producer. This is a bit of an odd outing in that Salsa is at the center but neither he nor his boss (played by Rashida Jones) seems to be very good at it. They had to edit in short cuts and often film either their upper or lower halves only. As I mentioned, the story is kind of cookie cutter. It's nothing you haven't seen before. It's the characters that make this happen. Frost is good in his role. Chris O'Dowd is covered in a layer of slime. You really want to see him get his. I liked Olivia Coleman as Frost's sister Sam. Ian McShane is okay as Frost's old teacher Ron Parfitt. The big surprise was Rahida Jones' character. Frost, and his co-writer Jon Brown didn't seem to know how to play her. SHe's supposed to be a big shot American taking over management of a large, British engineering firm. She seems lost with nowhere near the ammunition she needs for the job.
This is a fun flick. It might not be quite worth the 4 stars I gave it, but it IS entertaining. Sit back with a beer and some pizza and you won't be disappointed.",1437696000,,1698,4.205521472392638
6351779,5,B00JAQLM9I,Loved it!,1434931200,,9,4.0
6351780,3,B00JAQLM9I,"Of the trio who gave us Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The Worlds End, only Nick Frost has really had a hard time creating a name for himself on his own. Simon Pegg has appeared in the Star Trek and Mission Impossible series, while Edgar Wright has given us Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and was attached to Marvels Ant Man until he wasn't. By contrast, Nick Frost hasn't had much opportunity to create a name for himself stateside, though hes had a fair bit of success as the lead in the rather funny Sky TV series Mr. Sloane. For Frost, Cuban Fury was supposed to be his chance to prove his leading man chops. He succeeds, but unfortunately its in a rather predictable dance comedy thats oddly light on both dance and comedy. Nick Frost could easily become a big name for comedy lovers in America, but if its ever going to happen, hes going to need something better than James Griffiths lukewarm Cuban Fury.

Cuban Fury bases its sense of humor on the idea that Tragedy plus time equals comedy as it starts with the tale of young dancing prodigy Bruce (Frost) who, after a sequin-studded run in with a bunch of bullies on the way to a huge dance competition, swears off dancing and then falls very out of shape in the following years. Present day Bruce has let himself go quite a bit, and now suffers humiliation for his weight at the hands of his co-worker Drew (Chris ODowd), who also doesnt shy away from telling him about all his sexual exploits. This is Bruces life, and all the happy memories of a wide-eyed dancing boy are long gone. Or so he thought. When Julia (Rashida Jones), the new lady boss from America, arrives Bruce finds a kindred spirit in her in more ways than he expects: shes an avid salsa dancer. So begins Bruces attempts to break out of his shell and make peace with his past in order to show Julia how much they have in common, only to have his every advance thwarted by Drew whose self-confidence and desire to bed her lets him be more forthcoming with Julia.

Cuban Fury doesnt have any surprises for you; youve seen the story of the nice guy eventually winning out over the jerk who initially wins the girls attentions. You know Bruces efforts will be subverted to help Drew, and you know, ultimately, Julia will figure it all out. Cuban Fury follows the formula from start to finish. All that really distinguishes it from its peers is that the way the guy eventually gets the girl is through salsa dancing (but it may as well be synchronized swimming or juggling). In spite of that, it still manages to find some meager laughs thanks in large part to Frost, Jones, and ODowd being funny people. Ian McShane, as Bruces dancing coach, gets a couple laughs himself, but all of the jokes still feel rather tired.

The biggest downside of Cuban Fury is that its poor performance and mediocrity might lead people to think Nick Frost cant carry a comedy all on his own, which is absolutely incorrect. Given a proper funny script that doesnt play it safe every step of the way, Frost could be excellent. He conveys both drama and comedy with sincerity here, its just that the comedy is rather stale, leaving us with a drama about a former dance prodigy with a few jokes thrown in for good measure. Frost deserves another, better chance to win over American audiences.

Until then, Cuban Fury goes through the paces without stumbling, but it does so while counting every step out loud like a kid learning to waltz for the first time. That can be funny to watch, but mostly its just awkward and really repetitive.

6351786,5,B00JAQLM9I,"I'd never heard of this film before The Housemate and I went searching for a movie to watch last night.  We both love Chris O'Dowd and Nick Frost, so it looked like a good bet that we'd find something to like in this film.  And the title struck me as being hilarious, which suggested that I'd find the rest of the film at least somewhat amusing.

I wasn't prepared to love this movie.  I sure wasn't prepared to see Chris O'Dowd as an enormous jackass, or Nick Frost as a Salsa-dancing champion.  The film itself is formulaic with the sad-sack hero learning (or in this case returning to) a skill to impress the woman he's fallen for, but doesn't dare approach.  If you've been watching movies for even a few years you know that it's going to turn out well, that he's going to become good enough at the skill, whatever it is, to impress her, but that in the process he'll rediscover his own sense of self-worth.

That it is formulaic is a good thing because you don't have to worry about how it's going to turn out, you can relax and enjoy the journey.  You can, as we did, yell rude things at Chris O'Dowd's character every time he said something so mean we wanted to slap him or so awkward we almost felt sorry for him.  You can marvel at Nick Frost's ability to make you believe in who he is, and in his emotional turmoil, his love and genius for Salsa-dancing.  You can revel in how Ian McShane makes the whole guru thing his own by turning the training sequences into a shot-slamming, board-gaming bootcamp sort of experience.

There's a self-deprecating brilliance to this film that I couldn't help but love.  The characters, even the minor ones, are so much fun that you find yourself wanting to hang with them.  Rashida Jones and, particularly, Olivia Colman are both wonderful physical comediennes who just light up the screen.  Kayvan Novak is a brilliant goofball, and Rory Kinnear does a wonderful job in a thankless role as a mundane best friend.

I honestly had so much fun with this film that I want to see it again.  It made me feel good, and sometimes that's just the best thing of all.",1423958400,,2103,4.4516971279373365

6351792,4,B00JAQLM9I,"This purposefully absurd, delightful movie deserved a bigger audience. The always likeable Nick Frost is excellent here, especially when playing against Chris O'Dowd who's in top form here as Frost's co-worker and office cad.  There's one completely over-the-top dance-off/confrontation between the two that takes place in a parking garage...well, I can't accurately convey the sheer goofy hilarity of this scene.  Suffice to say these are two gifted physical comedians pulling out all the stops.  It's like 'West Side Story' meets 'Strictly Ballroom.'

It's 'Strictly' that kept springing to mind when I was watching this film.  That's very high praise in my book.  In 'Strictly,' Baz Luhrmann (in his audacious debut as writer/director), folded sequences of sheer slapstick hilarity inside of his real dance movie.  And here in 'Fury,' it's the same deal: comedy aside, Frost took his entre into the world of Salsa very seriously.  The excellent ""extras"" package show him arduously learning the craft of salsa dancing over seven months of lessons and workshops.  Frost says in an interview that he didn't want the type of movie where ""they showed my top and cut to someone else's bottom."" All the steps, lifts and twirls here are his.  It's clear from the Extras that that effort won the respect and admiration of his instructors and the real salsa aficionados called upon to fill out the movie's final rousing scenes.

All this and Rashida Jones (radiant and beautiful here), too?  What's not to love?",1418947200,,1504,5.1440329218107

6351794,5,B00JAQLM9I,This is a very funny movie. The jokes and storie are very entertaining. I can personally relate to Nick Frost in this movie as I too was a bit overweight a few years back and a female friend of mine encouraged me to go with her to salsa classes. Seeing Nick Frist dance brought back many memories and feelings. I enjoyed the movie on many levels.,1417824000,,346,4.257575757575758

6351796,4,B00JAQLM9I,"Nick Frost plays Bruce Garrett, a timid engineer, who decides to get out of his comfort zone when he meets a beautiful American Julia (Rashida Jones), who happens to be his boss. Though out of shape now, Bruce was once a child salsa-dancing champion 22 years ago, but because of one sad incident he stopped dancing. So, will Bruce win the heart of Julia and perhaps the salsa dancing contest?

Cuban Fury is sort of a one-joke comedy  you don't hate the idea of Nick Frost dancing salsa, do you?  with lots of familiar genre conventions. Ian McShane is slightly eccentric Ron, Bruces former coach. Scene-stealing Chris O'Dowd (The Sapphires"") is Drew, Bruces mean-spirited co-worker trying to woo Julia. Also, don't miss the cameo appearance pf Simon Pegg.

There is nothing particularly original about the story and characters. Still it is hard to hate this comedy because of the likable star Nick Frost. Maybe the film is in need of funnier jokes and better stories, but with great soundtrack music Cuban Fury is a pleasant watch.",1415923200,,1032,4.846590909090909

It was funny not always laugh out loud, it was a story of overcoming and triumph and the ""bad"" guy getting what he deserves.  And the humor was not too overboard for a 12-13 yr old.  It was not as geared toward the male point of view as I feel a movie with Simon Pegg (who I identify Nick Frost with) as the lead would have been.  It was a movie for all surprisingly enough.

6351817,5,B00JAQLM9I,"I'm a dancer; my husband is British. When we first met, I found zany British humor incomprehensible, and, well, indefensible. My husband had never danced a step -- he'd never even heard of George Balanchine! Now he eagerly attends ballet performances with me, and I can't get enough of zany British humor. This movie has both: great dancing, and sweet, silly humor (or, as my husband would write, *humour*).",1409702400,2,407,4.913043478260869

6351827,4,B00JAQLM9I,"FOR DANCE ENTHUSIASTS, YOU WILL FIND THIS IS A ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH DANCING, MORE THAN IT IS A ""DANCE COMEDY"".  LOTS OF NOSTALGIA FOR THOSE WHO CAN CATCH IT.

Depending on your expectations, you may find this a pleasant surprise or a small disappointment.  The movie definitely has some fantastic comedic moments and exciting dance scenes.  So how is it different than many dance comedies?  Well, if you are familiar with some of the more obscure but really classic ones, you know they often are heavy on the dancing while the acting and story are sometimes secondary.  This show gives a very subtle but specific nod to the one that started it all for me back in college.  A movie called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salsa-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B00008973C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salsa - The Motion Picture</a>.  During the opening scene of this movie, the viewer sees a glimpse of a movie called SALSA on a TV set as our protagonist watches it.  The boy is inspired by this movie and decides to learn and compete in salsa dancing.  The movie never tells the viewer about that movie or its influence, its implicit from the scene.  The comedic acting in this movie is excellent, while the parts showing dancing are a little more sparse compared to other movies in the genre.  The focus is more on the romantic comedy.  Hence, it is more a romantic comedy with dancing - rather than a dance comedy.

THE PLOT:  The movie begins with Bruce as a boy who sees a salsa show and becomes a dance fanatic, actually competing in salsa with his sister (a few Wonder Twins references are made).  The one competition they have not won is Nationals.  Just when this victory seems in Bruce's grasp, he is chased buy bullies right when he is on his way to the event.  They harass and beat him for wearing a sequin shirt and being a dancer.  This leaves him ashamed and he quits dance because he thinks it's un-manly.  Fast forward to present day and a beautiful American woman joins his company as his boss.  Lets just say he is waaaaay out of shape.  Worse, his jerk of a co-worker is moving in first to make the conquest.  Bruce feels the hopelessness of his situation until he follows her in a pub one day and finds she is taking salsa lessons upstairs.  ""She is of his world"" after all!  Bruce sets about getting his salsa skills up to snuff again by seeking out his old teacher.  Meanwhile, it turns out his jerk co-worker knows salsa too!  There will be showdowns and crazy characters.  Oh yeah, and you know there will be a salsa competition at the end.  Despite what you hear, this movie is not entirely as predictable as you may think.  Just mostly so!

Seeing this was billed as a dance comedy and set in the UK, I had hopes it was in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strictly-Ballroom-Blu-ray/dp/B00BAYLS1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strictly Ballroom [Blu-ray</a>] which was set in Australia.  If those are your expectations, set them aside right now.  This is not that movie in any way (I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it).  I admit I was disappointed at first, but got over it.  This movie may not give you a hernia laughing, but it does have terrific moments as I mentioned.  The character of Bejan from his dance class threatens to steal the show on several occasions.  I actually sought this movie out for Chris O'Dowd , who is a favorite comedic actor from several shows.  However, his character is intentionally odious and lewd as Bruce's romantic rival.  His dialog is much of the reason for the R rating as there is no nudity.  There is a very specific purpose for this lewdness, but frankly the movie runs the most dry during those times.  Even though this movie wasn't everything I expected, I felt it was very well done and loved it by the end.  For those who may be offended by a lot of intentionally bad sexual innuendo, you may not warm to this movie.  I also thought I noticed small hints of a nod to a hilarious Japanese movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance-1996/dp/B0002V7S34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?
