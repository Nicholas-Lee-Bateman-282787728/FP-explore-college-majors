A very funny movie that has a funnier ending and some good plot twists that make it worth owning!

678511,3,6303522661,"...is better than either of the two ""Dr. Goldfoot"" movies.

""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" (1965) and ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"" (1966) are spoofs of the early James Bond flicks and, to a lesser degree, the early 60's beach movies with Avalon & Funicello (mainly because Frankie stars in the first one and it shares the harmless, fun-spirited flare of the beach flicks). They're innocuous mid-60's slapstick comedies in the style of ""I Dream of Jeanie"", but extended to a full movie. Their main attraction can be found in their titles -- the 60's bikini-clad babes and Vincent price in the title role. Since I love both (and ""I Dream of Jeanie"") I figured I'd like these movies way more than I did, but I found them pretty forgettable, not to mention lame. Yes, I know, they're supposed to be lame, but there's good lame and bad lame and the two Dr. Goldfoot movies are mediocre lame, verging on bad.

The first movie takes place in San Francisco and the second one in Rome. These locations are highlights in addition to those already mentioned. These movies are also enjoyable as period-pieces as it's interesting to see the mid-60's styles, etc.

As far as the women go, I was a little disappointed with the first one in this respect; the second one is much better, not to mention it was directed by Mario Bava (which many insist is his worst film, lol).

At the end of the day, the Dr. Goldfoot movies are throwaway flicks, but they're worth catching for the highlights noted above, if you're in the right frame of mind.

The first movie runs 88 minutes and the second one 82 minutes.

678515,4,6303522661,"For being such a bizarre flick, it seems this movie just didn't embrace its bizarreness. Instead, it plays oddly straight laced about the entire proceedings, which feels very jarring because half of the going-ons pretty much stepped out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon.

That being said, it's quite enjoyable, the girls are pretty, and Vincent Price is clearly having FAR too much fun. Probably most enjoyed when not entirely sober.

This collection, which has many of the Price classics available, has produced this genius comedy and happily left out the poorly written and badly acted (even though Price reprises his role as Doctor Goldfoot) sequel. Here Price wears gold shoes in an Arabic style, has created women who can seduce almost any man, and has a minion who is doubtlessly devoted if not bumbling. (A constant when Price managed comedy as opposed to horror). Fans of Price must certainly add this gem into their collection and have a good time if they have a retro movie night.

By deploying an army of beautiful female robots (that he created) into seducing them, then disposing of them once their programmed objective is obtained. His most perfect creation, #11: Diane - Susan Hart) is sent out to beautiful downtown San Francisco to attract the attention of Todd Armstrong, one SF's most wealthiest single gentlemen, in order to marry him for all he is worth to Dr. Goldfoot. Somehow number eleven suffers mechanical malfunctions when she encounters a series of unfortunate events which cause her to derail into the arms of Secret Intelligent Commmand agent Craig Gamble (Frankie Avalon), a humble, but penniless SIC officer. This does not please Dr. Goldfoot & he has Diane reprogrammed & resent to her original suitor. Meanwhile Craig Gamble has discovered Dr. Goldfoot's diabolical plot & seeks to undermine his intent by exposing his  plans to Todd Armstrong. Madcap slapstick comedy ensues & Dr. Goldfoot's goal for world domination is ultimately thwarted. Was this the end to Dr. Goldfoot & his bikini machine? Apparently so, because the sequel (even with famed horror master, Mario Bava directing) was so bad, future installments were halted.

To see a classically trained actor like the late Vincent Price ham it up for this role is worth the cost of the DVD alone & of course there's the beautiful Susan Hart (#11).

I have been searching for this movie in the widescreen DVD format & apparently it is out of print, but as luck would have it, Amazon.com has come through again for me.

Remembering how sinister Vincent Price was with what films I have seen him in already at that point, my sister made sure that this film was different. She used to go to the movies alot growing up, so i assumed she had seen this before. Think I was right.
From the start, I heard the Supremes sing the title song. WHAT A TREAT! I love the Supremes!
Then the film progresses. I saw Annette Funicello! I love her too!
Susan Hart is gorgeous. Frankie Avalon. Well, saw him too. Just wasn't prepared to see him do slapstick and straight-forward comedy with clothes on as was used to seeing him in bathing trunks.
Vincent Price on the other hand was cool to see. His performance was off the cuff, natural, and down-right perfect.
To those who disliked this film: you have high expectations!
This film was created to cash-in on the James Bond craze, and American International seemed to sometimes like to make a buck by doing films like these.
I was entertained. I expected nothing more. Even though I grew up to experience film on a higher level, does not discount the fact that I still can get a laugh out of this film. It is great nastalgia, and still entertains on many levels.

Frankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman each made better teen films, and though co-star Vincent price is a hoot and Susan Hart is hot, the screenplay is a dud. Worse yet, the script's original musical bent was trimmed down to only the terrific Guy Hemric/Jerry Styner-penned theme song. The film's low production values are mediated by great location footage of San Francisco and a terrific claymation title sequence by Gumby's creator, Art Clokey. Like any number of 1960s spy films - dramas and comedies - there's a lot of opportunity to pick out things Mike Myers poached for his Austin Powers series, not least of which are the gold bikini clad fembots. Lots of slapstick from the entire cast (which includes character actor Jack Mullaney), and some entertainingly bad green screen work in which Avalon and Hickman ride a motorbike amongst what seem to be gigantic trucks and cars. Keep your eye peeled for cameos from several AIP Beach Party stars. The original Beach Party films are better entertainment (particularly for their musical content) and better mid-60s spy spoofs can be found, but if you've exhausted both genres, see this one for completeness.

678583,5,6303522661,"In those glorious days of yesteryear there was a certain type of movie that appealed to the young people of the 1960's. They were the bikini beach movies that were light on plot, but heavy on cleavage. The spirit of these movies has not lived on, but for anyone seeking the glorious years of 60's cinema can find it through the miracle of DVD.

Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine may never be compared to Gone with the Wind, but it had a much hipper theme song. The plot is as simple as it is genius. Dr. Goldfoot, played by Vincent Price, and his sidekick Igor has developed a machine that mass produces bikini clad babes. They are sent out to marry the rich and rob them blind. How great is that?

He is thwarted by none other than Frankie Avalon. He was a staple in the bikini films along with Annette. She does do a brief cameo in this film and if she turned you on in anyway, you may get a bit of a thrill to see her locked in a rack. S&M fetish freaks with a touch for nostalgia probably have the image as their desktop photo.

Well the movie is fun and light hearted, but this movie has something that no other movie has. Have you ever, at least once, wanted to witness a trolley chase? Not only that, but the finale chase also includes a moped and a boat on a trailer. Of course the film really doesn't end with Vincent Price falling off a cliff and exploding after being hit by US Naval gunfire as it may first appear. No, no. The wily Price is in the cockpit of the plane as our heroes fly off to France. The sequel was ready to begin. Enjoy!",1152662400,3,1553,4.152823920265781

Beware - this band of bikini-clad cuties is licensed to kill... with comedy! Featuring Vincent Price and Frankie Avalon, with cameo apperances by Annette Funicello as a decapitated young lady, and Harvey Lembeck chained to his motorcycle. This sex-ational spy spoff is full of thrill-packed fun and gags. Deraged Dr. Goldfoot (Price) has a dream of taking over the universe! So the mad scientest invents a machine that builds sultry, bikni-clad, sexy chicks. Whom he programs to seduce the world's wealthiest men into signing over their fortunes, than permanently scratching them. But when Secret Agent (Avalon) learns of GOldfoot's evil plot, he knows he must destory these gorgeous gold diggers before losing his heart and possible his own live, to the hottest assassins ever built in the history of the 60's Beach Flicks. This is a great classic beach movie that also stars Dwayne Hickman, Susan Hart, Jack Mullaney, and Fred Clark. So if you want to relive the 60's Teen Flicks, watch Dr. Goldfoot And The Bikini Machine tonight, for a bundle of fun, laughs, and bikini-clad girls.",1123459200,10,1315,5.032110091743119
678645,3,6303522661,"I have been watching some of the mid-sixties spy-spoofs lately and Dr. Goldfoot was near the top of my list.  This one has a great title, a very unusual combination of characters (Frankie Avalon and Vincent Price!), and, as the cover says, ""Super sexbots...built to kill!""  Of course, campy films walk a fine line - if they don't work as a spoof they are silly, if not banal.

Fortunately, this one works out great, spoofing not only the Bond-era spy film, but also a number of other film and cultural icons of the '60s.  Do you like Pink Panther films?  Well, we have the bumbling detective - a common spoof between the two as they play the gap between collected spy and nervous screwball cop.  Yet, as much as this movie reflects the larger '60s culture, it is also a tripartite fusion of Vincent Price B-grade horror, Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello (who makes a cameo appearance) beach gasser, and Kennedy-era high-tech spy thriller.

Bottom line: if you like early Bond or '60s camp, then this is a film to check out.  Lots of interesting forgotten tidbits buried in here.",1113177600,,1078,4.696808510638298

In his run of movies for AIP and Roger Corman, he also did a couple of gems - the other ""Comedy of Terrors"" *****, and they make a great popcorn double-feature for a Saturday Night.  Both movies showcase the rarely seen fun-side of the very talented Vincent Price.
In Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine - total mindless fun - Dr. Goldfoot (Price - a sly, wicked performance having a hoot of a time) has made a machine to manufacture a bikini clad  army of robots who are programmed to seek out wealthy men, marry them and charm them into signing over their assets, before bumping them off.  With passing pokes at Princes own AIP films and the Bond films, it is good giggles.  Not as sharp as ""Comedy of Terrors"", it's still great for Prince Fans, people who enjoyed Myers spy spoofs, or those looking for a time-capsule blast from the past, this is an enjoyable diversion!

However, when it comes to the young Secret Service agent Craig Gamble (Frankie Avalon), Dr Goldfoot has met his match!
When the beautiful robot Diane (the striking Susan Hart) seduces a young billionaire (Dwayne Hickman), he enlists the help of Craig to help uncover what he is sure is a dreadful plan to rob him of his money.
Clever comedy that dissolves into the predictable with a formulaic slapstick car chase finale and features some macabre cameos from Annette Funicello and Harvey Lembeck as well as BEACH BLANKET BINGO co-star, the late Deborah Walley.
