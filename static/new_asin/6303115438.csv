7839982,5,6303115438,"In this thrilling western, cowpoke Kiowa Jones (Robert Horton) crossespaths with a U. S. Marshall escorting two convicted killers to Fort Smithto be hanged. The two convicts are ""The Gypsy"" (Nehimiah Persoff), a man who killed his wife because of an illness out of mercy, and BobbyJackwell Wilkes (SAL MINEO), a heartless killer of over 20 men. Stricken with a sudden illness, the Marshall dies, but before he passes he deputizes Jones and asks him to escort the killers to Fort Smith, where a $1, 000 reward is waiting. But the task will not be simple. Bobby Jack (MINEO) has also put the word out that he will pay anyone $2, 000 to anybody who will rescue him from the law, and countless bounty hunters are waiting in the wild west to ambush Jones and free Bobby Jack! And the bounty hunters will stop at nothing to save him. Along the way, Jones runs into a fearless yet beautiful woman, played by actress , Diane Baker, who helps Jones fend off two bounty hunters and decides to join Jones on his journey. But the REAL reason to watch this film is to watch Mineo's amazing turn as an evil character. Sal Mineo's performance as the vindictive killer Bobby Jack is riveting. His character is so evil and unremorseful, and, with an angelic smile, he delivers a deliciously evil, maniacal laugh throughout the film. Although the other actors turn in decent performances, most notably, Diane Baker, Sal Mineo by FAR is the most interesting character here. His performance is so richly played to the extreme without making it seem forced. We really believe Mineo is evil, which is a far cry from his other roles. This film will convince any Sal Mineo fan of what a versatile, intense actor he was. Capable of playing any role of any genre, Sal Mineo is utterly amazing in this role. Highly recommended to all Sal Mineo's legions of fans.",1079481600,11,1835,4.649230769230769
